["IN 2014, Dave Brat, an ally of President Donald Trump, was the face of the nascent anti-establishment insurgency, beating Eric Cantor, then the second most powerful Republican in the House of Representatives. Four years later, Mr Brat is on his way out, having been denied a third term by a Democratic newcomer who harnessed the anti-Trump fury of this year\u2019s most prized voters: affluent, well-educated suburban women.\n\nThe ascent of Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA case officer, was meteoric, rather like the change that is remaking Virginia\u2019s seventh district, a mix of leafy suburbs and rolling farmland close to Richmond, the state\u2019s capital. Though the district tipped to Donald Trump in 2016 and to the unsuccessful Republican nominee for governor, Ed Gillespie, the following year, voters in its Chesterfield County and Henrico County suburbs have become increasingly disenchanted with President Donald Trump, his assault on the Affordable Care Act, and his hostility towards immigrants. Last year, Chesterfield backed a Democrat for governor for the first time since 1961.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese traditionally Republican suburbs, which swelled in the 1960s with conservative whites fleeing heavily African-American Richmond during the struggle over public school desegregation, are now moderate and multihued. Thanks in part to the presence of several global companies Chesterfield and Henrico now brim with younger, non-native professionals, including large numbers of Asians and Hispanics.\n\nThe manner in which the seventh district has changed is emblematic of the Republican Party\u2019s bigger problem in Virginia: it is fading in the suburbs. In the tenth district, in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC, Jennifer Wexton beat the Republican incumbent, Barbara Comstock. The district had not elected a Democrat to the House for 36 years. In the seventh, Ms Spanberger\u2019s healthy majorities in heavily-populated Chesterfield and Henrico more than offset Mr Brat\u2019s victories in the district\u2019s eight other counties\u2014all of them rural and Trump-friendly.\n\nMr Brat\u2019s troubles were evident in the opening days of the Trump administration, when the congressman was besieged by constituents angry over the Republican assault on health care. The most outspoken were women, whom Mr Brat, a former economics professor, complained, \u201cget in my grill no matter where I go.\u201d Comments such as these, as well as outrage over Mr Trump, sparked furious exchanges at heavily attended town hall-type meetings, and Mr Brat took his re-election campaign underground. His appearances, including with Mike Pence, the vice-president, and Paul Ryan, the Speaker, were often invitation-only. The media was not informed of his movements. All this fed a perception that Mr Brat was distant and arrogant.\n\nMs Spanberger, by contrast, came across as cool, approachable and engaged. Her national security credentials\u2014before the CIA, she investigated money laundering and drug trafficking for the US Postal Service\u2014made it difficult for Republicans to depict her as another wimpy Democrat. (They had the same problem with Elaine Luria, a retired Navy commander, who scored a surprise victory against Scott Taylor, a former Navy seal, in Virginia\u2019s second district.)\n\nRepublicans tried another line of attack on Ms Spanberger. Television commercials (paid for by a super-PAC aligned with Mr Ryan) highlighted her work as a substitute teacher at a Muslim academy in Northern Virginia whose graduates included two accused terrorists. Ms Spanberger had taken the job while she was waiting for her security clearance after receiving a job offer from the CIA. The ad seemed to fall flat with voters.", "MIDWESTERNERS grew used to presidential visits during the mid-term election campaigns. In the final two weeks of the campaign Donald Trump roused voters at rallies in Wisconsin, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Missouri (twice), Indiana (twice) and Ohio (twice). For the Democrats, Barack Obama paid regular visits, kicking off his post-White House return to public life in September with a feisty speech in downstate Illinois, before adding visits to Wisconsin, Indiana and, once again, Illinois.\n\nThey came for a pair of reasons. First, the region hosted several competitive races for House, Senate and Governor. In this off-year election, more than usual, national politics especially stirred up voters. The other reason, for those already looking ahead to the presidential race in 2020, is that the Midwest will again be influential as a battleground. Narrow victories for Mr Trump in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania gave him with a path to the presidency in 2016. Mid-term results in these states are being studied closely for evidence that he might prove successful again.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the evidence suggest? Each party has something to cheer. Look at Senate results and the picture was undoubtedly brighter for Republicans. A Wisconsin Democrat, Tammy Baldwin, might have kept her potentially vulnerable seat with ease, as did senators in Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota. But Republicans gained in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, dashing Democrats\u2019 hopes that Midwestern soybean farmers, for example, might turn against the Republicans. A worsening trade spat with China has disrupted agricultural markets and two more years of economic pain could produce a different outcome, but Democrats can\u2019t bet on it.\n\nIn the House, Democrats had the better time. Of the 27 congressional seats the Democrats gained nationally, eleven were in the Midwest (depending how you define the region): three in Pennsylvania, two in each of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan and Minnesota, plus one in Kansas. Crucially, these were mostly seats gained in suburbs, not truly urban areas. The party still struggles to win outright rural support. It is finding ways to appeal in semi-rural areas, which is a start, but the urban-rural split remains as stark as ever.\n\nDemocrats also picked up significantly in state legislature and governors\u2019 races, buoyed by heavy spending. The Republicans are pleased they held on in Iowa and South Dakota despite rumours of vulnerability there. The most dramatic Democratic win was by Laura Kelly (pictured), who will be governor of usually solid-red Kansas. (She was helped along by an opponent whose ultra-Trumpism and over hostility to migrants perhaps makes this result a one-off).\n\nTony Evers, a mild-mannered former teacher also succeeded, by the thinnest of whiskers, in stopping Scott Walker from getting a third term as Republican governor in Wisconsin. Gretchen Whitmer picked up an open Governor seat in Michigan; while a billionaire, J.B. Pritzker, toppled a weak, moderate Republican in Illinois. Honours were shared in two other races\u2014Democrats held on in Pennsylvania, while Republicans kept their man in Ohio. In Colorado, if the definition of the Midwest is stretched farther west, the Democrats produced the first gay man to be elected as governor.\n\nIn all, the Democrats probably feel happier with the outcome. Given the current cheerful economic climate (farming aside) in much of the region, Republican incumbents might have expected to get more credit from voters. Unemployment is generally low; wage growth is beginning to climb; and in Wisconsin, for example, Mr Walker had won a big investment in a factory by Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer (though only by promising enormous subsidies that look all but impossible to justify). Instead many voters appeared to be moved by other issues, such as a wish for access to expanded Medicaid or for higher spending on schools or roads, or they reacted badly to Mr Trump\u2019s vitriol against immigrants. In Illinois Mr Rauner looked hopelessly isolated. Some voters in suburbs, such as in Naperville, a formerly Republican area an hour west of Chicago, said they most wanted to send a message that they dislike Mr Trump.\n\nDespite that, there is little evidence for the Democrats to conclude that the Midwest will be theirs in 2020. A high turnout appeared to help Democrats in particular. But they won different races across the regions because of a variety of candidates and different strategies that will be hard to repeat two years from now.", "Robyn Denholm was named as the new chairman of Tesla, as part of a deal with regulators under which Elon Musk is relinquishing the role at the electric-car manufacturer. Ms Denholm is the chief financial officer at Telstra, an Australian telecoms firm.

The Chinese e-commerce company now boasts 601m \u201cactive consumers\u201d. Amazon reported a much lower customer base the last time it released such figures.\n\nSoftBank reported a big jump in quarterly net profit, to \u00a5526.4bn ($4.6bn). That was mostly due to returns from technology investments in its Vision Fund. The Japanese conglomerate has had to face some awkward questions about the Saudi money that is backing the fund since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Its share price has fallen by a fifth following the killing of the Saudi journalist, allegedly by Saudi government operatives.\n\nThe political manoeuvring continued in the trade war between America and China. Wang Qishan, a senior Chinese official, indicated that Beijing was ready for a discussion about \u201cmutual concerns\u201d with Washington. That came after President Xi Jinping lashed out at what he described as international trade\u2019s \u201claw of the jungle\u201d. Mr Xi and Donald Trump are expected to discuss how they might end their stand-off when they meet at the G20 summit this month.\n\nAmerican prosecutors brought criminal charges against two former bankers at Goldman Sachs and a Malaysian financier in connection with the alleged misappropriation of funds from Malaysia\u2019s 1 MDB development fund (one of the bankers has pleaded guilty). Goldman said it was co-operating with the Department of Justice\u2019s continuing investigation and acknowledged that the proceedings could result in significant fines or sanctions against the bank.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway revealed that it had repurchased $928m-worth of its shares in August, its first buy-back in six years. Warren Buffett\u2019s investment company has not completed a takeover in nearly three years. Spotify, a music-streaming service, announced a $1bn buy-back of its own.\n\nThe share prices of Italian banks came under renewed pressure, ahead of a deadline for the Italian government to submit a revised budget that meets EU rules. Italy\u2019s big banks did better than many of their European counterparts in the recent stress tests conducted by the European Banking Authority. But questions remain about how tough those tests really are. See article.\n\nOn the other hand\n\nA remark by the governor of the Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda, that it was no longer appropriate to implement \u201ca large-scale policy to overcome deflation\u201d was taken as the clearest indication yet that he is minded to move on from the central bank\u2019s enormous stimulus programme and start tightening monetary policy. Mr Kuroda hedged his comments, however, and said he would keep interest rates extremely low for the foreseeable future.\n\nAmerican employers added 250,000 people to the payrolls in October, the 97th consecutive month of jobs growth. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the lowest it has been since the late 1960s. Pay grew at the fastest pace, year on year, since April 2009, though that was in part because it bounced back from a low base in October 2017, when wages were unusually depressed following a big hurricane.\n\nBuoyed by higher oil prices, Rosneft reported a 150% rise in net profit for the third quarter compared with the same three months last year, to 142bn roubles ($2.2bn). Russia\u2019s biggest oil company also benefited from being able to increase production, owing to an agreement between OPEC and Russia in June that eased restrictions on output.\n\nQuality, not quantity\n\nApple\u2019s share price struggled to recover from the drubbing it received after it downgraded its outlook for the all-important final three months of the year, which includes the Christmas shopping season. The company also said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sells, unsettling investors who have come to rely on those figures as a gauge of Apple\u2019s health. It says unit sales are less relevant. In the latest quarter, for example, Apple sold 47m iPhones. Although that was similar to the same period last year, revenue from iPhone sales soared by 29% because it was shifting dearer devices.", "ONE OF the parts of air travel that is hardest to understand is the system by which some passengers get seat upgrades or better service on board for free, while others are left to languish. It is an urban legend that wearing a suit or asking really nicely is the magic way to bag a seat at the front of the plane. But there is a secret score that can affect the chances of doing so.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany airlines assign passengers a \u201ccustomer lifetime value\u201d, or CLV, score. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, carriers work out this number for each of their customers to measure their potential financial benefits to the company. They then use it to make all sorts of decisions, such as how sympathetically to handle a customer\u2019s complaints.\n\nWhen it comes to flying, a CLV score takes into account information such as how frequently a customer makes complaints and how often they are affected by flight delays and lost luggage. Companies do not perceive much value in retaining the business of customers who complain all the time, so regular whiners get bad scores. Conversely, frequent flyers in business class who rarely moan get some of the best. Sometimes these scores are transmitted to flight attendants, many of whom are now issued with handheld digital devices on which they can read about passengers. Cabin crew can use this information to wish flyers a happy birthday or decide whether they are worth compensating for inconveniences such as a spilled coffee or broken screens.\n\n\n\nSome airlines have held back on supplying too much information to flight attendants for fear of overstepping privacy laws. \u201cThere\u2019s a point where you don\u2019t want to make people feel like, \u2018Gee they know everything about me and they\u2019re tracking everything I do\u2019\u201d, John Slater, senior vice president of inflight services at United Airlines, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\n\nTo some travellers, the existence of CLV scores might be reassuring. To them, they are a sign that airline customer-service decisions are not entirely arbitrary. But to others, they are a reminder that airlines with access to digital technology are able to monitor their customers with ever closer scrutiny. Travellers who are aware of the system are likely to think twice before they call an airline to complain about lousy service, lest it come back to bite them.", "ADAPTING Shirley Jackson\u2019s dark fiction is a tough task, and few have done it convincingly. \u201cLizzie\u201d (1957), a version of \u201cThe Bird\u2019s Nest\u201d, a novel about a woman with psychiatric difficulties, was a first faltering step; Jackson herself condemned the film as \u201cAbbott and Costello meet a multiple personality\u201d. \u201cThe Haunting\u201d (1999), Jan de Bont\u2019s retelling of \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House\u201d, was even worse, seeing Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Liam Neeson pestered by poorly rendered CGI ghosts. In 2010, reviewing a stage adaptation of her last novel, the New York Times wrote that, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong in the new musical \u2018We Have Always Lived in the Castle\u2019\u2026and that\u2019s exactly the problem.\u201d\n\nHollywood and television executives have nevertheless eyed Jackson\u2019s writing with renewed interest following a collection published in the Library of America series, as well as the release of \u201cA Rather Haunted Life\u201d, Ruth Franklin\u2019s authoritative biography, in 2016. A new motion-picture version of \u201cWe Have Always Lived in the Castle\u201d, a story about two ostracised sisters, premiered at the Los Angeles film festival in September (Laurence Jackson Hyman, dissatisfied with previous adaptations of his mother\u2019s writing, worked on the project as an executive producer). A ten-part \u201cmodern reimagining\u201d of \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House\u201d (pictured) was released on Netflix this month. A feature-length film drawing on \u201cThe Lottery\u201d, Jackson\u2019s infamous short story, was announced in July. Next year Elisabeth Moss will star as the writer herself in \u201cShirley\u201d, a psychodrama based on Susan Scarf Merrell\u2019s novel.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis glut is not just a result of the vicissitudes of literary posterity. Jackson blends horror and mystery and applies it to themes that not only feel relevant today, but vital and urgent. \u201cThe Lottery\u201d, which centres upon an annual small-town ritual of murderous brutality, lays bare the cruel deeds committed in the name of community. Published three years after the end of the second world war, the author knew that good, ordinary people could execute acts of mundane evil en masse. The questions of complicity, mob psychology and scapegoating that the story raises are still being asked today, in America and elsewhere.\n\nDrawing on her own experiences, Jackson often explored the strictures of gender roles. Her women are torn between their own needs and desires and society\u2019s prescriptive demands. They are trapped by houses, hide themselves away in them, or both. They are often agoraphobic\u2014Jackson suffered from the condition late in her life\u2014in response to a hostile world. Ms Franklin writes that Jackson\u2019s work constitutes \u201ca secret history of American women of her era\u201d, and it is a history that still rhymes with contemporary reality.\n\nSuch themes can be teased out on screen, but the style and mood of Jackson\u2019s work is harder to achieve. She heartily despised her nickname of \u201cVirginia Werewoolf\u201d, but the moniker is somewhat apt given that her novels are concerned with the troubled subjectivity of their female protagonists, maintaining an ambiguity about what is actually happening. Delusions become real; reality proves illusory. Her unique blend of humour and horror has proved challenging to capture without resorting to camp.\n\nIndeed, that is where the new version of \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House\u201d falls short: it is determinedly humourless. It contrasts dourly with Jackson\u2019s tragicomic novel, which pours ridicule on the bumptious scientist/ghostbuster who leads the expedition to the spooky house. It replaces Jackson\u2019s female focus with a soapy family drama, leaning heavily on flashbacks and resulting in something like \u201cThis Is Us\u201d meets \u201cLost\u201d. It softens Jackson\u2019s idea of horror, which sees the frail innocent destroyed by a pitiless universe. For the show, trauma is a teachable moment. \u201cMost times, a ghost is a wish,\u201d murmurs Steven, a writer who puts on glasses whenever he is being a writer (Jackson would have abjured such wispy hokum). Although it keenly advertises its debt to the source material and its creator\u2014peppering references to her work throughout, quoting tweaked chunks of her prose and even calling one of the main characters Shirley\u2014it is but a pallid imitation of the work of the same name.\n\nThose looking to bring Jackson\u2019s unsettling visions to life should refer back to Robert Wise\u2019s film, \u201cThe Haunting\u201d (1963). It is both wryly comic and deeply disturbing. Like the book, the film mingles the psychological and supernatural; the haunting comes from external forces but is also fuelled by the protagonist (an idea picked up by Stephen King, a fan of Jackson\u2019s work, in \u201cThe Shining). Jackson was impressed by the adaptation, telling a reporter: \u201cI was terrified. I couldn\u2019t believe I had written this.\u201d Her work continues to be reimagined and revisited because, like Hill House, it distresses the reader and yet beckons them in.", "A S DAWN BREAKS in Hanoi the botanical gardens start to fill up. Hundreds of old people come every morning to exercise before the tropical heat makes sport unbearable. Groups of fitness enthusiasts proliferate. Elderly ladies in floral silks do tai chi in a courtyard. In the shade of a tall tree, dozens of ballroom dancers sway to samba music. Others work up a sweat on an outdoor exercise-machine. Tho, an 83-year-old with a neat white moustache, says he comes to walk round the lake every day, rain or shine.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next few decades the gardens will become busier still. Vietnam has a median age of only 26. But it is greying fast. Over-60s make up 12% of the population, a share that is forecast to jump to 21% by 2040, one of the quickest increases in the world (see chart). That is partly because life expectancy has increased from 60 years in 1970 to 76 today, thanks to rising incomes. Growing prosperity has also helped bring down the fertility rate in the same period from about seven children per woman to less than two. In the 1980s the ruling Communist Party started to enforce a one-child policy. Though less strict than China\u2019s, it has hastened the decline.\n\nDemography is changing in similar ways in many Asian countries. But in Vietnam it is happening while the country is still poor. When the share of the population of working age climbed to its highest in South Korea and Japan, annual GDP per person (in real terms, adjusted for purchasing power) stood at $32,585 and $31,718 respectively. Even China managed to reach $9,526. In Vietnam, which hit the same peak in 2013, incomes averaged a mere $5,024. Indonesia and the Philippines are expected to reach the turning-point in the next few decades, with an income level several times higher than Vietnam\u2019s.\n\nThis shift brings headaches. First, will the government be able to support millions more Vietnamese in old age? Only the extremely poor and people over 80 (together around 30% of the elderly) get a state pension, which can be as little as a few dollars a week. The most recent survey of the old, in 2011, found that 90% of them had no savings worth the name. Debt was common. Supporting them will become ever more expensive. The IMF predicts that pension costs, at the present rate, could raise government spending as a share of GDP by eight percentage points by 2050. That is faster than in any of the other 12 Asian countries it examined.\n\nThe problem is worse in the countryside, where most old folk live. Previously the young cared for their parents in old age. Today they tend to abandon village life to seek their fortune in the city. Surveys suggest that the share of old people living alone is rising, especially in villages. Many work until they die. Around 40% of rural men are still toiling at 75, twice the rate of city-dwellers. In Britain that figure is 3%. Often they do gruelling manual jobs, such as rice farming or fishing.\n\nProviding health care for millions more old people is another worry. Alzheimer\u2019s, heart disease and age-related disability are growing. In the botanical garden Toau, a 78-year-old in a white sports T -shirt, says he is there on doctor\u2019s orders, before taking a pill for his bad heart and joining an exercise group. About a third of over-60s do not have health insurance, which is costly. Many provinces still have no proper geriatric departments in hospitals. Informal health-insurance groups have popped up to fill the gaps. For a fee, members get exercise classes and free check-ups. But few doctors are trained or equipped to treat more serious conditions.\n\nThe government is starting to implement policies to reduce the fiscal burden and improve the lot of the elderly. Last year it relaxed the one-child policy. In May it said it would increase the retirement age from 55 to 60 for men and 60 to 62 for women, and reform the pension scheme to provide wider coverage. Next year it plans to begin revamping the health-insurance and social-assistance systems.\n\nBut none of that will change the structure of the economy. Usually as countries climb the income ladder they shift from farming to more productive sectors, like services. By this yardstick, Vietnam is lagging behind its neighbours. When the working-age population peaked in 2013, agriculture accounted for 18% of the economy. At the same juncture in China, agriculture was just 10% of GDP . Worse, farmers\u2019 output tends to decline with age, unlike, say, that of managers. This over-reliance on agriculture partly explains why three-quarters of Vietnam\u2019s workers are in jobs where they become less productive as they get older. In Malaysia that is the case for only about half the labour force.\n\nBoosting productivity will be tricky. The government is still wedded to statism. State-owned enterprises dominate many industries. Most university students, meanwhile, waste at least a year learning Marxist and Leninist theory. Many countries in Asia are ageing fast. But growing old before it becomes rich makes Vietnam\u2019s problems all the greater.", "B EFORE DONALD TRUMP became president, Democrats would have struggled to name a Republican they disliked more than Jeff Sessions. The then senator from Alabama is an ultra-restrictionist on immigration and opposes changes to sentencing that would lock fewer people up. As Mr Trump\u2019s attorney-general, he championed separating migrant children from their parents, among other terrible ideas. Yet his removal on November 7th, after the president demanded his resignation, has caused a rare spasm of bipartisan concern.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is because Mr Sessions, despite his flaws, believes in the rule of law. He was also willing to defy Mr Trump to defend it. His decision to recuse himself from the Justice Department\u2019s probe into allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian election-hackers was forced upon him by his own lying about Russian contacts. But after Mr Trump turned on Mr Sessions, apparently in fear of the investigation under Robert Mueller that his recusal unleashed, he stood firm.\n\nMr Trump calls Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation, which has so far indicted or secured convictions against four members of his campaign team and 26 Russians, a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. He blames it on Mr Sessions, and often demanded he close it down. He also urged him to launch diversionary probes into his political rivals, including Hillary Clinton. Mr Sessions refused to be \u201cimproperly influenced by political considerations.\u201d That was more spine than other senior Republicans have shown Mr Trump.\n\nThe charitable view of his removal\u2014the day after the mid-terms, apparently because Mr Trump feared it might have cost him votes\u2014is that the president wanted a more pliant attorney-general. He simply refuses to accept that, as the boss of law enforcement agencies such as the FBI that operate at a remove from the executive, the attorney-general is more than the president\u2019s legal fixer. His model for the job, according to a former Trump confidant, is Roy Cohn, the late mob lawyer who advised him in his early real-estate days. His appointee to replace Mr Sessions on an acting basis, Matt Whitaker, the former attorney-general\u2019s chief of staff, should please him.\n\nHe is a highly partisan Republican who has insisted that judges take a \u201cbiblical view of justice\u201d. His own view appears mainly to track Mr Trump\u2019s. Mr Whitaker has attacked the FBI for failing to indict Mrs Clinton. He has been a fierce public critic of Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation, which he seems to think is a \u201clynch mob\u201d. He has said, falsely, that the former FBI director has no mandate to investigate Mr Trump\u2019s business interests\u2014something the president had described, with no authority, as a \u201cred line\u201d. Mr Whitaker has also suggested the investigation could be killed by cutting its budget. He is now in charge of it.\n\nA darker view of Mr Sessions\u2019 removal is that it is a means of bringing about what Mr Trump and Mr Whitaker both want, the end of the Mueller investigation. This would represent by far the biggest rule-of-law crisis of Mr Trump\u2019s presidency\u2014perhaps since Watergate. A sitting president would have shut down a counter-espionage investigation into a hostile state\u2019s attack, because it threatened to implicate himself or his children. Would he get away with it?\n\nThe incoming Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives were swift to denounce Mr Sessions\u2019 removal. Nancy Pelosi, the likely next Speaker, called it \u201canother blatant attempt\u201d by Mr Trump to end the Mueller probe. Democratic-led committees would investigate him if he did. But there is a limit to what they could do without fulsome backup from Republicans, and there is little sign of that.\n\nRepublican Senate leaders have refused to vote on a bill to protect Mr Mueller. Only a few expressed concern at Mr Sessions\u2019 removal. Last year Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, once known as a principled conservative, said there would be \u201choly hell to pay\u201d if Mr Trump sacked his former Senate colleague. Shortly after he in effect did so, Mr Graham tweeted that he looked \u201cforward to working with President [Trump] to find a confirmable, worthy successor so that we can start a new chapter at the Department of Justice.\u201d", "T UCKED AWAY on a side street, in a strip mall between a barber and a couple of empty storefronts, Panader\u00eda Oaxaque\u00f1a, a modest bakery that smells of yeast and cinnamon, is a hub for Columbus\u2019s growing Latino population.

In another, officials were made to heave heavy clods of clay into the air repeatedly as punishment for allowing such impediments to farming to accumulate on land they are in charge of.

As the name suggests, it sends pizzas to polling places with long queues. On November 6th it dispatched 10,000 pizzas to 576 polling places in 43 states. And queues were indeed long. In New York people waited more than two hours; in metropolitan Atlanta the average voter waited around three. If the first reaction to such news is gratitude for the generosity of strangers, the second should be bafflement. Why, in one of the world\u2019s richest, oldest democracies, should it take that long to vote?\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne reason, says Lawrence Norden, a voting-technology expert at the Brennan Centre at New York University Law School, is that most states are using voting machines at least a decade old. \u201cThese are computers,\u201d explains Mr Norden, \u201cand after ten years, you should be looking to get new machines.\u201d Forty-three states are using machines so old that spare parts are no longer made.\n\nAcross the country, equipment malfunctioned. Scanners failed. Alarmingly, some electronic voting machines changed people\u2019s votes. Precincts ran out of ballots and were unprepared for the relatively high turnout. In Phoenix one polling place was foreclosed on the night before the vote, leaving ballots and voting machines locked inside.\n\nSome see a dark purpose behind the chaos. In Georgia the Republican nominee for governor was also secretary of state, charged with overseeing elections, in which capacity he faced multiple lawsuits and allegations of attempted voter suppression. On election night the longest queues were said to be in the part of the state friendliest to his opponent. Voter suppression need not entail, as it once did in the South, naked intimidation. Capricious enforcement of otherwise pointless rules leading up to a chaotic election day can do the trick, too.\n\nAttempted voter suppression can also backfire. North Dakota passed a law requiring voters to present a street address, which many of the state\u2019s many Native Americans do not have. Critics said it was intended to keep them from the polls. On November 6th they turned out in record numbers.", "F UNKY MUSIC blared as balloons and silver ticker-tape tumbled over a ballroom of gyrating Democrats. J.B. Pritzker, Illinois\u2019s new governor, declined to strut as he greeted members of a noisy crowd. He had the air of a jovial, portly uncle presiding over a family gathering. Had his party outdone expectations? \u201cWe\u2019ve had an excellent night,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe toppled an unpopular, one-term Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, thanks, in part, to dropping over $170m of his own money on the race. That is a remarkable (and record) sum even for an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune whose assets exceed $3bn. Mr Pritzker\u2019s largesse helped Democrats reach beyond urban strongholds to commuter suburbs such as Naperville, an hour\u2019s drive from Chicago. Democrats won a super-majority in the Illinois legislature.\n\nHis efforts are emblematic of a wider, and belated, push by Democrats. For much of the past decade the party neglected races for state legislatures and governors\u2019 mansions (see charts). \u201cWe were asleep at the wheel,\u201d concedes an activist. In contrast, Republicans grasped the strategic importance of state legislatures, which in many places have the power to gerrymander. Republican candidates ground out state-level victories in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan that prefigured Republican national gains in such places in 2016.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 neglect is over, judging by spending on state-level races this year. Local parties reportedly devoted over $2.2bn to such races, not far off the $2.4bn for congressional campaigns. Democrats won solid returns: seven new governorships, for a total of 23 states.\n\nThat matters for three reasons. First, because governors shape policy. Some new ones will now roll out expanded Medicaid, adding to the 33 states that already took extra federal money under the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare). Tony Evers, who squeaked to victory in Wisconsin, Janet Mills in Maine, and Laura Kelly, who delivered a shock win in usually Republican Kansas, have all vowed to do so.\n\nThe effects of this will be far-reaching. Figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation suggest that in these three states, plus Idaho, Nebraska and Utah (where voters backed referendums on expanding health care) an extra 424,000 people will become eligible for insurance. If all were to sign up, the average (non-elderly) adult population without insurance would fall in those states to just 6.5%, from over 11% today. Democrat-run states are also likely to rethink prison policies and boost education spending, not least where new governors like Mr Evers, or Tim Walz in Minnesota, are ex-teachers.\n\nSecond, the governors\u2019 races point to which figures might prosper in future, national elections. Rich, moderate and female candidates did well for Democrats. In Colorado, Jared Polis became the first openly gay governor. Andrew Gillum, the African-American mayor of Tallahassee, ran a strong, left-leaning campaign in Florida focused on young, urban and minority voters. But he lost to Ron DeSantis, who called him a radical socialist. The Republican\u2019s crude comments, such as warning that his opponent would \u201cmonkey this up\u201d, did not backfire. Many voters, in Florida at least, warm to a conservative.\n\nLast, the new crop of governors will influence how future elections are run. In Georgia, Kansas, North Dakota and elsewhere, state governments were accused of trying to suppress minority votes. That should now be less likely, at least in Kansas. And after the census in 2020 state legislatures will draw up plans for redrawing congressional districts. Governors, who have veto powers, in theory could insist on fairer voting. More probably they will prove partisan, making Florida redder and Illinois more resolutely blue.", "O NE\u2019S EYES are drawn to the agave plant towering over the man who grew it, Juan Pacheco, but the secret to its flavour is in the ground. For eight years the plant has absorbed minerals from the soil of Oaxaca, a mountainous state in southern Mexico. Mr Pacheco alternates agaves with maize to enhance the taste that the soil imparts to them. His father taught him how to make mezcal, the smoky spirit made from agaves, a type of succulent. Mr Pacheco\u2019s grandfather and great-grandfather were mezcaleros, too. But his children are thousands of miles away, studying medicine in the United States.

Mezcaleros toss mature agave hearts weighing 50kg (110 pounds) apiece into pits of fire, where they burn for days. A donkey then walks around in a circle, pulling a large stone wheel that crushes the burnt plant, readying it for fermentation, which takes ten days.\n\nThese artisanal techniques have brought glamour to a drink once sold in plastic bottles, sometimes containing a worm-like moth larva. Now bartenders from Los Angeles to Berlin expound on the terroir of the nine mezcal-producing states in Mexico and the subtleties of flavour that come from various types of agave. In 2017 some 5m litres of mezcal were sold in Mexico and abroad, a fivefold rise from 2011.\n\nWith popularity comes anxiety. In August the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, a government body, expanded mezcal\u2019s \u201cdenomination of origin\u201d, the area in which makers of a product are allowed to give it a certain name, which was already the world\u2019s largest. It now includes three more states: Morelos, Aguascalientes and the State of Mexico. Alejandro Murat, the governor of Oaxaca, where 87% of mezcal is made, joined protests by mezcaleros in Mexico City. His government says that \u201cpoor-quality\u201d mezcal from \u201cdistant places, devoid of tradition\u201d could sully the drink\u2019s handcrafted image.\n\nConnoisseurs fret about the \u201ctequilisation\u201d of mezcal. Mexico produces 50 times more tequila, a type of mezcal made only from blue agaves, than it does mezcal, which can use any kind of agave. In Jalisco, the source of 90% of tequila, making the spirit is an industrial process. Drones hover above agave fields, checking which plants are ripe. Agave hearts roll on conveyor belts into electric ovens. Chemicals speed up fermentation.\n\nThe origins of this factory approach are in the mid-19th century, when a few rich families acquired vast estates in Jalisco, on which they grew agave. In Oaxaca, by contrast, land ownership is mainly communal and individuals work small plots. Today there are thought to be 57 makers of mezcal for every tequila distillery.\n\nThe mezcal boom is already changing the production process. A third of the mezcal sold in Mexico is no longer deemed \u201cartisanal\u201d by the Mezcal Regulatory Council. The price of espad\u00edn agave, the most common source of mezcal, has quadrupled because of rising demand. Some makers have resorted to plucking wild agaves, which are not then replaced, from Oaxaca\u2019s yellow hills. The growth of supply is slowing, even as demand for mezcal continues to increase. The squeeze will last for a while. Agaves planted today will ripen by the end of 2026. That may protect mezcal\u2019s mystique for a little while longer.", "\u201cW E ARE FREE from political interference,\u201d protests New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. A scandal in the National Party, the main opposition, suggests otherwise. Last month an embittered National MP , Jami-Lee Ross, accused the party\u2019s leader, Simon Bridges, of breaking campaign-finance laws. He claims Mr Bridges deliberately disguised a donation of NZ$100,000 ($67,000) orchestrated by a businessman with links to the Chinese government. In a phone conversation that Mr Ross taped of him and Mr Bridges discussing the donation, neither makes any explicit reference to concealment. Mr Bridges calls Mr Ross\u2019s allegations \u201cbaseless\u201d. But whether the law was broken or not, the saga has stoked concerns about Chinese meddling.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang Yikun, the man behind the donation, is a resident of New Zealand, but has held positions in several official Chinese organisations, according to Chen Weijian, a dissident journalist from China who also lives in New Zealand. Mr Ross\u2019s recording suggests the money was divided into smaller parcels, which meant it did not have to be declared. (Donations of less than NZ$15,000 can be kept anonymous, provided the benefactor lives in the country.) But on the call Mr Ross also presented the donation as an amalgam of smaller gifts from associates of Mr Zhang. Police are investigating whether the donation was properly disclosed. Mr Ross, meanwhile, has been expelled from his party. Whatever the outcome, the row suggests munificence can win influence. In the call, Mr Ross and Mr Bridges discuss whether the party should respond by adding a business associate of Mr Zhang\u2019s to the list of MP s appointed by the party under New Zealand\u2019s system of proportional representation.\n\nThis is not the first controversy surrounding Chinese interference. Last year it emerged that another conservative politician, Jian Yang, had worked for 15 years in Chinese military academies and been a member of the Communist Party before emigrating to New Zealand. He did not disclose this on his residency application, but denies being a spy and remains a member of parliament. China-born MP s belonging to the governing Labour Party and the right-wing ACT have also been linked to organisations peddling China\u2019s agenda.\n\nIt is impossible to work out how many donations come with Chinese strings attached, because so many are made anonymously. Simon Chapple of Victoria University of Wellington calculates that the National Party received handouts worth NZ$4.5m in 2017. Three-quarters came from unnamed sources. At a fundraising auction in 2016 for Labour\u2019s Phil Goff, now the mayor of Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s biggest city, an anonymous bidder in China paid NZ$150,000 for a book written and signed by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president.\n\nSeveral former politicians have taken jobs with Chinese firms. The Chinese government keeps tabs on Chinese students at local universities and has co-opted most Chinese-language media. Last year Anne-Marie Brady of the University of Canterbury alleged that a Chinese-owned dairy had been used to launch a scientific device that could help China develop long-range missiles. A report published recently by Canada\u2019s intelligence agency complains that New Zealand is a \u201csoft underbelly\u201d through which China might gain access to intelligence shared by America, Australia, Britain and Canada.\n\nIn Australia, similar scandals have prompted the passage of new laws aimed at crimping foreign influence. The Greens, part of New Zealand\u2019s ruling coalition, want to lower the threshold for anonymous donations to NZ$1,000 and outlaw gifts from foreigners. A petition calling for an inquiry on foreign influence has been lodged in parliament. Publicly, Ms Ardern maintains that New Zealand\u2019s laws are fine as they are. But her government does seem to be considering how to respond\u2014without jeopardising trade with China.", "H OTEL RECEPTIONISTS are rarely this intimidating.

Health costs as a proportion of America\u2019s economic output have soared since, from 14.5% in 2003 to over 17% in 2017, with drug-price inflation a big culprit. Less than 2% of Americans are treated with specialty biotech drugs, but these account for as much as 35% of total drug spending.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe good news is that cheaper biotech drugs are coming. Known as biosimilars, these complex copycat drugs (which are a bit like generics) have been allowed in Europe since 2004 and in America since 2010. At first, owing to policy roadblocks and anti-competitive tactics by incumbents, only a few came to market. But the firms that make them, which range from biotech giants to scrappy upstarts, are turning the trickle into a torrent.\n\nConsider Humira, a biotech drug made by America\u2019s AbbVie that treats rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn\u2019s disease and other maladies. It is the world\u2019s top-selling drug; annual sales of $20bn are more than double that of the next two top sellers combined. The annual cost (after rebates) of Humira in America has shot up from about $19,000 a patient in 2012 to some $38,000 a patient. David Maris of Wells Fargo, a bank, calculates that a 9.7% price increase imposed earlier this year by AbbVie on Humira could add $1.2bn to America\u2019s health-care costs in 2018.\n\nSuch sums explain why the launch of several biosimilar rivals to Humira in Europe in October is being watched closely. Five copycats, which regulators have verified are safe and effective, have been approved and three have launched. One of them is Amjevita, which is made by Amgen, a giant American biotech firm with pricey branded drugs of its own to defend. AbbVie confirmed in an earnings call on November 2nd that rivals are undercutting Humira\u2019s list price by up to 80% in some European countries. This has forced AbbVie to cut prices steeply.\n\nIn America a similar battle is brewing over Neulasta, a biotech cancer drug made by Amgen with global sales of some $3.7bn this year. On November 2nd America\u2019s Food and Drug Administration approved a biosimilar rival to Neulasta developed by Coherus BioSciences, a biotech firm based in California. Its pricing is unknown but this time it seems likely to be Amgen that has to lower prices.\n\nMakers of biosimilars do face hurdles. The owners of branded biologic drugs have been known to put out misleading advertising that casts doubt on the copycats\u2019 safety. Denny Lanfear, boss of Coherus, bemoans the fact that firms typically file dozens of patents on old drugs to extend their monopolies. He notes that AbbVie\u2019s \u201cpatent thicket\u201d means Humira will not face biosimilar competition for years to come in America. Also, nobody knows whether President Donald Trump will follow up on his recent praise for biosimilars with practical policies on reimbursement for them in the Medicare system.", "W HATEVER YOU do if you are a European company pulling out of Iran, do not mention the sanctions. On November 5th America re-imposed an embargo on Iran, aimed at blocking its supposed nuclear ambitions. Its restrictions to trade do not apply directly to European companies but bosses fear being banned from the American market if they keep doing business in Iran. Yet obeying America\u2019s sanctions is itself illegal under rules devised by Europe, whose leaders want to keep Iran in the global trade fold.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirms opting to bow to America have thus devised a ruse: blame unspecified issues of \u201ccommercial viability\u201d for their decision to leave Iran. This is what British Airways and Air France both did when they recently stopped flying to Tehran. Most big firms have announced that they are leaving, including Total, a French energy group, and Siemens, a German engineering giant. (American firms were banned even before, though with occasional exemptions, such as Boeing selling Iran aircraft.)\n\nThe exodus is perhaps inevitable. \u201cAnyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,\u201d President Donald Trump blasted on Twitter when the sanctions were further ratcheted up in August. Few think America will act on the threat of imposing \u201csecondary sanctions\u201d on defiant firms, but even fewer care to find out whether Mr Trump is bluffing. BNP Paribas, a French bank, was fined nearly $9bn in 2015 for doing business with embargoed countries, including Iran.\n\nEuropean policymakers think this unfair. They have alighted on two potential solutions. The first is to threaten European firms with being liable for any costs incurred by other companies as a result of their compliance with the sanctions. But this seems, by all accounts, to be a political statement, not a genuine policy: in practice no firm pulling out of Iran is going to get punished, officials admit.\n\nThe second is a mechanism that would act as a state-owned buffer between Iranian firms and European ones. The finance ministries of Britain, France and Germany\u2014the European parties to the Iran nuclear trade deal that America is pulling out of\u2014want to set up a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d ( SPV ) to intermediate trade. The idea is that European companies buying from and selling to Iranian counterparts would not have to send or receive money from Iran, but would pay each other instead.\n\nUnder the mechanism an Italian importer of Iranian pistachios, for example, would settle the tab of an Iranian firm buying German machinery through a ledger organised by European governments (these payments would be mirrored in Iran). No money would enter or leave Iran, many of whose banks are being cut off from the international financial system (on November 5th SWIFT , the Brussels-based international financial messaging system, said it would comply with American sanctions and suspend some Iranian banks\u2019 access). Firms from third countries might be able to participate in the SPV , too.\n\nAs a plan it has two big flaws. One is that, despite America announcing sanctions six months ago, the SPV is still on the drawing board. No country has volunteered to host it. Officials vaguely recall a similar system of formalised barter allowing access to the Soviet Union, but can offer no firmer blueprint for now.\n\nThe second defect is that the proposed SPV only resolves the issue of payments. Companies trading with Iran could still be designated as societas non grata by America. \u201cAt the end of the day, you are still engaging in trade with Iran,\u201d points out Maya Lester, a sanctions expert at Brick Court Chambers in London, and so still potentially liable for secondary sanctions.\n\nMichael Tockuss, head of the German-Iranian Chamber of Commerce, says that some smaller German firms will continue exporting to Iran if they have no business in America.

Those sharing the link on WeChat, a social-media and payments service that is the crown jewel of the Chinese technology giant, see something else: \u201cThis title contains exaggerated and misleading information\u201d. The swap is ostensibly the result of a move by Tencent in April to sanitise content, after a crackdown on popular online platforms by government regulators, but is also self-serving. Scoffing WeChat users circulated the article just to highlight the switch.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be no surprise if Tencent were feeling touchy as it approaches its 20th anniversary on November 11th. Its shares, traded in Hong Kong since 2004, have fallen by 28% in 2018 (see chart). This time last year it was the first Asian company to be worth half-a-trillion dollars, hitting a record valuation in January of $573bn. It has since shed $218bn, roughly equivalent in value to losing Boeing or Intel. Other Chinese internet stocks have fared worse than Tencent, among them NetEase, a gaming rival, and JD .com, an e-commerce firm. But even so, the drop stands out.\n\nThe company posted its first quarterly profit decline for nearly 13 years in the three-month period ending in June. A regulatory hold-up that was blocking it from charging for new video games was the chief culprit, it explained. Although it has sprawled into all sorts of areas, from online lending (WeBank) and insurance (WeSure) to offline medical clinics (Tencent Doctorwork), the company still derives over two-fifths of its revenue from gaming. Its latest big bet in mobile games, \u201cPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds\u201d, has accrued a huge audience of some 50m Chinese gamers who play daily, but because of the monetisation freeze, Tencent cannot cash in.\n\nThe government suspension, which began in March without explanation, had been expected to ease in the autumn. Analysts now assume that Tencent will need to tough it out until the second half of 2019. Even once game approvals start up again, the government has said that their number will be limited. To allay Communist Party concerns about the mental and physical health of young gamers, Tencent is also having to curb gaming time and set up a system of user-identity checks.\n\nCapricious regulators may not be wholly to blame for the slowdown in online games, says Steve Chow of Agricultural Bank of China International ( ABCI ), a Chinese investment bank. Users may simply be spending less time on Tencent\u2019s online entertainment, as other players eat into its market share. For its flagship game, \u201cHonour of Kings\u201d, for example, the average number of daily active users has dropped by a fifth in the past year or so, to 54m in September.\n\nFor skittish investors, all this has concentrated minds on whether the giant can maintain its momentum as it enters its third decade. Most agree that gaming will remain an important part of the company, but not its chief driver of revenue growth.\n\nTwo concerns are particularly acute. Because its games have done so well, Tencent has been lackadaisical in monetising other parts of its business. It has rightly been nervous about expanding advertising within WeChat, though the service sees unrivalled Chinese mobile traffic of over 1bn monthly active users. Last year Tencent took about one-tenth of total third-party spending on digital ads in China. But Baidu, China\u2019s leading search engine, took 19% and Alibaba, a giant in e-commerce, drew in almost a third.\n\nA second worry is that crimped profits will make it harder for the firm to keep investing heavily in areas outside its core business. Tencent has been backing promising startups in a race with Alibaba to find new users and sources of growth, battling indirectly in areas as varied as food delivery and online education. In some, such as cloud computing, the pair compete directly. Although Tencent\u2019s investors are supportive of this approach, Jerry Liu of UBS , a bank, says the wider tech sell-off stems from a recognition that China\u2019s maturing internet sector is becoming \u201ca zero-sum game\u201d: dominant platforms are having to invest more to stay ahead and so their margins are shrinking.\n\nTencent\u2019s first internal-restructuring plan since 2012, announced in September, offers a clue to the company\u2019s thinking. In it Tencent set out a long-term shift away from the consumer internet towards business services, marking \u201ca new beginning for the company\u2019s next 20 years\u201d. It has set up a new unit for cloud and \u201csmart\u201d industries, combining all its on-demand software and online services for firms that seek to go digital. Pony Ma, Tencent\u2019s boss, said the \u201cmain battlefield\u201d for mobile internet is moving from consumers to companies.\n\nAlibaba, born to bring businesses online through its virtual emporia, has a strong lead in this arena. Last year it took 45% of China\u2019s fledgling cloud-computing market, worth 69bn yuan ($10bn), compared with 10% for Tencent, according to IDC , a research firm. Still, Tencent doubled revenue in cloud services in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. Earnings from \u201cother businesses\u201d (ie, payments and cloud) overtook those from its social networks for the first time.\n\nMr Chow reckons that Alibaba and Tencent can both create large businesses in cloud computing since the market has lots of room to grow. And Tencent boasts powerful assets. WeChat is on over four in every five Chinese smartphones, so offers a massive market for firms. Last year it introduced a cloud-based platform that allows companies to offer services to users in WeChat via \u201cmini programs\u201d (ie, tiny apps). There are more than 1m mini programs, used by over 200m people every day.\n\nFor now, however, its revenue from such mini programs and other built-in services is still \u201cclose to zero\u201d, notes David Dai of Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm. Meanwhile rivals have introduced their own offerings of mini programs. Among them is Bytedance, a newish giant that has young Chinese hooked on its flawlessly addictive video and news offerings, curated with artificial-intelligence technology. It is a thorn in Tencent\u2019s side.\n\nIn particular, the way in which Bytedance is capturing very young users, as well as young talent, makes Tencent look increasingly grizzled. To increase its appeal to youngsters, Tencent in April revived a short-video app it had shut down, called Weishi, and made it a near-copy of Bytedance\u2019s wildly popular Douyin app.\n\nPan Luan, a former tech journalist who published a widely-read essay in May contending that Tencent had \u201cno dream\u201d, says the giant looks lumbering at times because \u201cits whole structure is ageing\u201d. Young staff say they have few channels for promotion to decision-making positions, says Mr Pan, and few opportunities to build sparky products, as Tencent spends on stakes in other companies. A young Tencent employee who left to work for a newer tech firm says that pay at firms like Bytedance and Kuaishou, a short-video app (in which Tencent has a stake), is \u201cin another band\u201d, and that they feel more like foreign startups.\n\nTencent\u2019s outsize influence in China\u2019s online world is ballast that should steady it as it targets business customers. For sheer scale, WeChat seems likely to hold its own. It has given Tencent a powerful distribution channel for its own games, and has allowed it to stymie new rival products, including Douyin, by blocking them from its platform. But the giant is under pressure, and seems to know it. \u201cWe have to stay awake,\u201d urged its president, Martin Lau, last month. Such introspection is necessary. Mr Chow says it was thought until this year that \u201cTencent could win every battle\u201d. With more formidable competitors on the scene, the company will need to pick its fights more carefully.", "\u201cY OU HAVE the most peculiar ideas of relaxation,\u201d Laura Jesson tells her aloof husband in the film \u201cBrief Encounter\u201d, when he suggests that she unwind with a cryptic crossword.

It has become a staple of British culture, celebrating the messy ambiguities of English with its complex riddles and wordplay. Agatha Christie was a fan. Crosswords were used to recruit codebreakers in the second world war. But some fear for the puzzle\u2019s survival. Newspapers, where most crosswords are printed, are in decline. And a younger audience is put off by the puzzle\u2019s impenetrable rules.\n\nYet technology is offering solutions to both of these brain-teasers. The crossword has transitioned remarkably well from paper to digital platforms, says David Parfitt, the Times\u2019s puzzles editor. His newspaper has introduced a \u201cquintagram\u201d, tailored to smartphones, which has no grid and just five clues, making it quicker to complete and easier to navigate on a morning commute.\n\nTechnology can also help the uninitiated, via \u201chint\u201d buttons and the option to check answers. (We ran a cryptic crossword in 2016\u2019s Christmas issue, with online explanations of the clues.) Cracking a cryptic puzzle requires awareness of various conventions. For example, the word \u201cregularly\u201d signals using every other letter of the word it accompanies: \u201cPart of foot, regularly stroked\u201d is toe.\n\nThough the best competitive crossworders are a greying lot, moving the crossword online gives newcomers a chance. And for the first time since 2008, the Times competition has a new champion.

That is the message of this year\u2019s survey of opinion in 18 countries by Latinobar\u00f3metro, a pollster based in Santiago, Chile. The proportion of people who are dissatisfied with how democracy works has jumped from 51% in 2009 to 71%. The share that is content has dropped from 44% to 24%, its lowest level since the survey began more than two decades ago (see chart 1 and chart 2).\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat does not mean most Latin Americans are ready to dump democracy, which has become the norm across the region only since the 1980s. More than half say that it is better than any other system, though that has dropped by 13 percentage points over the past eight years. Disillusioned democrats lean towards indifference. The share who are neutral has risen from 16% in 2010 to 28%, while support for authoritarian government is steady, at about 15%. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like the democracy they are experiencing,\u201d says Marta Lagos, the head of Latinobar\u00f3metro.\n\nIn Latin America\u2019s two biggest countries, Brazil and Mexico, that sentiment has resulted in the election of presidents this year who until recently would have been widely considered too radical to lead their countries. If disillusionment deepens, future elections could bring presidents who test the region\u2019s democratic norms.\n\nSince last November nine countries have either re-elected presidents or chosen new ones. Most of these elections were free and fair but there were notable exceptions. Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, had his term in office extended in a rigged vote in May. Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s re-election in Honduras last November was widely seen as flawed. Cuba simply transferred power from one dictator to another in April. Most Latin Americans, though, live in countries where their votes are counted accurately. That does not mean they are happy, as Latinobar\u00f3metro\u2019s 20,000 interviews, conducted from mid-June to early August this year, make clear.\n\nVoters have many reasons to grumble. Growth in GDP per person has dropped sharply since the global financial crisis in 2009. Venezuela\u2019s economy has imploded and Brazil\u2019s suffered its worst-ever recession from 2014 to 2016. The perception that income is distributed justly has plunged from 25% in 2013 to 16%. That belief may be wrong; the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, has been dropping in the biggest countries. But, at an individual level, a person\u2019s perception of inequality is among the strongest predictors of his or her dissatisfaction with democracy.\n\nEconomic worries are at the top of citizens\u2019 concerns in most countries. Only in Venezuela do more than half the people say they do not have enough to eat. The regional average, though, is a still startling 27%. Crime is the second main gripe, leading the list of worries even in some relatively safe countries, such as Chile and Uruguay. Corruption is another big complaint. Eighteen former presidents and vice-presidents have been implicated in corruption scandals, including in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. The share of Latin Americans who think their countries are going in the wrong direction exceeds the proportion who think they are progressing by eight points, the largest negative gap since 1995.\n\nThis has battered the credibility of institutions. Only the armed forces and the church, powerful institutions before the advent of mass democracy, retain much respect (see chart 3). Half of Latin Americans believe that all or almost all presidents and legislators are involved in corruption. The share of people who think the elites govern for their own benefit has risen steadily over the past decade; nowhere does it fall below 60%. Increasingly, voters are disengaged from politics. For the third year running, the number who say they will vote for no political party is bigger than the number who say they will vote for one.\n\nPoor people are more alienated than the rich and middle class. People who are badly off lag behind prosperous folk by more than ten percentage points in their level of support for democracy. The young are more sceptical than the old, which bodes ill for democracy\u2019s future. Some 200m Latin Americans with low levels of education, about 30% of the total, are the voters most prone to lash out at established politicians and parties, and to choose leaders who promise to solve problems with a \u201cmagic wand\u201d, writes Latinobar\u00f3metro in an analytical note accompanying the results. The survey, which has a margin of error of 3% per country, is published exclusively by The Economist.\n\nIn Brazil, where satisfaction with democracy is lowest among the 18 countries, disillusionment opened the way for Jair Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper who extols the dictatorship of 1964-85, to win the presidency last month. He had strong support from well-educated Brazilians.\n\nIn July Mexico elected Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a populist of the left whose Morena party fought its first election in 2015. No fan of dictatorship, he proposes to change the way democracy works by handing more decisions to voters through referendums. Ms Lagos worries that democracy in Argentina is vulnerable. Its economy is heading into recession and the share of people who call themselves middle class dropped by 14 points from 2013 to 2018, the biggest such decline in the region.\n\nIn countries whose leaders are dismantling democracy, citizens appreciate it more. Although just 12% of Venezuelans are happy with how their \u201cdemocracy\u201d functions, 75% prefer democracy to any other system. In Nicaragua, where the increasingly dictatorial regime of Daniel Ortega has been repressing protests since April, satisfaction with democracy plunged from 52% last year to 20%, but more than half of the people still support the system. Encouragingly, good governance also bolsters support for democracy. Prosperous Uruguay, Costa Rica and Chile, where the rule of law is relatively well established, are the countries most satisfied with how democracy works\n\nThe best hope for shoring it up rests with leaders who do not claim to possess magic wands. Several have recently taken office. They include Len\u00edn Moreno in Ecuador and Mart\u00edn Vizcarra in Peru, who have embarked on campaigns against corruption. Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, Chile\u2019s centre-right president since March, is trying to reform the economy and social programmes. The centre-left president of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado, defeated a fundamentalist Christian and is trying to fix the tax system. Iv\u00e1n Duque, Colombia\u2019s conservative president, is just getting started. If they are successful, they will boost democracy\u2019s approval ratings as well as their own.", "B RITAIN\u2019S POP-GUZZLERS are a surprisingly health-conscious lot. Earlier this year the country became the first where sugar-free versions of Coca-Cola outsold the real thing. Whether Britons follow similar principles when it comes to imbibing their politics will dictate the fortunes of Labour and the Conservatives.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cDiet\u201d policies have become the norm in British politics, with both main parties promising a healthier version of the other\u2019s platform. In last month\u2019s budget the Conservative chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced that austerity was \u201ccoming to an end\u201d, in what amounted to a toned-down version of Labour\u2019s promise to open the spending taps. Meanwhile his opposite number, John McDonnell, surprised many in his party by saying that Labour would support the Tories\u2019 plan to give a tax break to the well-off, by raising the threshold at which the higher rate of income tax is levied. The Tories have previously stolen Labour ideas such as a cap on energy prices, while Labour has adopted a law-and-order policy that would fit snugly into the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto, with its call for more police and border guards.\n\nWhether parties benefit from aping their opponents depends on the policy area, argues Margit Tavits of Washington University in St Louis. She examined voters\u2019 behaviour in 23 countries over 40 years. On issues that are seen as pragmatic, such as the economy, voters are happy for a party to change its tune. But when it comes to so-called principled policies, including immigration, voters will punish a party that strays from its beliefs. This is the case even when the party is shifting towards the median voter\u2019s views. Both Labour and the Conservatives lost ground to the UK Independence Party when they mimicked its hard line on immigration, offering stiff rhetoric but few policy changes. This pattern repeated itself across Europe.\n\nBut what works on the pages of an academic journal is messier in real life, argues Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London. Deciding whether a policy area is pragmatic or principled is more art than science. The National Health Service, for example, bestrides both. And nabbing too many of an opponent\u2019s policies may annoy a party\u2019s core supporters, whatever the issues in question. Mr McDonnell faced grumbles from Labour MP s (including those usually well to the right of him) for supporting the Tories\u2019 tax break. Some Conservative MP s complain that Theresa May spends too much time talking about what they see as Labour issues, like NHS funding, and not enough on traditionally Tory concerns, such as lower taxes.\n\nLabour aides are confident that the Tories\u2019 \u201cDiet Corbynism\u201d is no match for the real thing. After all, the government\u2019s mooted plan to reduce tuition fees for some subjects pales in comparison to Labour\u2019s promise to abolish them (as well as smacking of hypocrisy, since the Tories introduced the higher fees only six years ago). Conservative wonks insist that voters do not care where a policy came from.

She is not alone. This year\u2019s Carthage Film Festival, which runs from November 3rd to November 10th in Tunis, features several Tunisian films that tackle radicalisation. In \u201cBrotherhood\u201d, a young Tunisian man returns from Syria to his parents\u2019 farm with a fully veiled Syrian wife. His mother is happy to see him, but his father is suspicious. After a few days he reports his son to the police (though he later regrets his decision).\n\nThe Tunisian government\u2019s policy is to arrest returning jihadists immediately. \u201cThere is no rehabilitation at all,\u201d says Messaoud Romdhani of the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, an NGO . More than 1,500 Tunisians have been jailed on terrorism charges, according to his group. \u201cPrison is a very good place to become more radicalised,\u201d he says.\n\nBut so is the neighbourhood. Another film, \u201cFatwa\u201d, follows a father\u2019s efforts to figure out how his recently deceased son fell in with radical Islamists. He discovers that the area of Tunis where his son lived has been transformed by Salafism, a puritanical version of Islam. The old imam, a devotee of Sufi mysticism, has been replaced by a more conservative preacher; the cinema has closed. \u201cIt\u2019s the type of conversation we\u2019ve been having in private for years,\u201d says Zakia Hamda, an activist and filmgoer from Tunis. \u201cOur traditional values were snatched away by fundamentalists. It was traumatic.\u201d\n\nOn October 29th a woman, who may have been radicalised online, blew herself up not far from cinemas taking part in the festival. That did not scare away audiences. At a screening of \u201cFatwa\u201d cheers rang out when the father pinned an extremist against the wall. \u201cWe work for Allah to promote virtue and eliminate vice,\u201d says the radical. \u201cGo get yourself a job and Allah will look after himself,\u201d says the father.", "I N A HOUSE in central Dakar three Chinese men stand behind a glass screen.

Clusters can be found in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Others have opened in Uganda, Ivory Coast and Congo.\n\nTheir spread underlines China\u2019s growing soft power in Africa. In 2000 when China held its first-ever Forum on China-Africa Co-operation, a summit held every three years, traditional remedies were on the agenda. Two years later it hosted a conference in Beijing to discuss the topic. Many of China\u2019s 48 Confucius Institutes in Africa teach courses in traditional medicine.\n\nMoreover, as many as 50,000 young Africans are studying in China, many on scholarships provided by the host government. Although only a small share are at medical school, many students return with a taste for acupuncture and herbs. Demand is also buoyed by China\u2019s large diaspora in Africa, which some reckon has grown to 1m people.\n\nOne practitioner, Mame Awa Diop, studied traditional medicine in China before the Confucius Institute in Dakar asked her to set up a clinic.

Touting their products online, luring customers with digital advertising and eschewing conventional retailers and marketers, they were anomalies shaking up small segments of retail. In fact, the growth of microbrands\u2014or direct-to-consumer ( DTC ) brands\u2014represents a profound shift in the consumer-goods sector.\n\nIndustry giants took time to begin worrying about the arrival of game-changing newcomers; barriers to entry in their business are high. But by now the incumbents are stagnating. According to Nielsen, a consultancy, the biggest 25 food-and-beverage companies, for example, generated 45% of sales in the category in America but drove only 3% of the total growth in the industry between 2011 and 2015 (see chart). A long tail of 20,000 companies below the top 100 produced half of all growth.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine, 25 years ago, coming up with the idea for a radically better toothpaste, suggests Randall Rothenberg, the boss of the Interactive Advertising Bureau ( IAB ), a trade organisation for digital advertisers, who studies microbrands. Raw materials would only be available by the tonne. No factory would produce toothpaste for a tiny new player. Ads would be hopelessly expensive so driving demand would be impossible. No large retailer would stock it.\n\nThat is no longer true, thanks to shifts in supply chains and data. The growth of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d manufacturing means startups no longer need to splurge on inventory. The surge in food startups meant factories had confidence to let him start with a small order, on the condition that future ones would be bigger, says Blake Sorensen, founder of Blake\u2019s Seed Based, which makes allergy-friendly snacks.\n\nOther service providers can pass on economies of scale once available only to consumer-goods giants. Lumi, a packaging firm, uses a network of factories to design and produce packaging for small brands. It represents thousands of brands so can get better prices.\n\nBusinesses such as ShipBob, a Chicago startup, do something similar with shipping, allowing small brands to offer faster, cheaper deliveries. E-commerce companies such as Shopify provide turnkey online shops from as little as $29 a month. Shopify handles the back-end infrastructure that would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build, says Steven Mazur, one of the founders of Ash & Erie, a brand of clothing for short men. Assembled Brands provides funding specifically to microbrands. It will invest in any kind of manufactured consumer-goods product as long as the company has started trading.\n\nMicrobrands can also sell their products through Amazon. The costs are high but it gives them access to the online giant\u2019s shipping services and huge user base. Many of the big firms have, by contrast, been reluctant to sell on the giant\u2019s website, so feature low in search rankings. More of them have started selling on Amazon in recent years, says R.J. Hottovy of Morningstar, a research firm, but it still represents a small slice of their sales.\n\nSelling directly to consumers means that microbrands boast a wealth of data. Mr Sorensen launched his business online in January 2018. He sold $50,000 of snacks and then, on the basis of data gleaned, Blake\u2019s Seed Based changed its recipe and relaunched in September. M Gemi, an online seller of posh shoes, offers new designs weekly so can respond precisely to consumer demands. Their giant rivals, by contrast, use data filtered by retailers.\n\nOnline advertising, using platforms such as Facebook, allows brands to target customers with great accuracy. The vast majority of growth in advertising is coming from the digital kind, and a large proportion of this is from small advertisers, says Jonathan Barnard of Zenith, a media agency. Meanwhile many big companies, especially the consumer-goods firms, are keeping their spending flat or reducing it in view of pressure on margins.\n\nConsumer-goods behemoths are well aware of the threat posed by microbrand ankle-biters. One response is to buy them. Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club, a subscription service for razor blades and now-canonical microbrand, for $1bn in 2016, grabbing the market share the upstart had itself snatched from Gillette. The biggest ten consumer-goods firms have all recently invested in direct-to-consumer startups. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s acquisition in 2017 of Blue Bottle, a hip Californian coffee brand, bought it exposure to new market segments.\n\nCompetition is fierce to buy the best microbrands so big firms may overpay for their acquisition, says Mr Hottovy. Explaining its purchase last year of Native, a small deodorant brand, Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble, explicitly referred to its DTC model, saying it is \u201cwhere things are going\u201d. Other big firms are trying to grow their own brands. Earlier this year Kraft Heinz launched Springboard, an incubator for small, disruptive food and drink brands.\n\nIn the long term some small brands will be swallowed up but others will be encouraged, argues Sonali De Rycker of Accel, a venture-capital firm. More will want to remain independent for longer, or entirely, which will mean larger deals or IPO s.\n\nTo flourish, incumbents will not only have to acquire these new brands or start their own; they will have to learn from them. And instead of having a discrete set of multi-billion-dollar brands, sold through third-party retailers, they will have to come up with larger portfolios of smaller, more transitory ones, argues Mr Rothenberg. Scale still matters, but it will have to be used more shrewdly.", "I F THE HEALTH of a democracy were measured only by the number of candidates contesting a presidential election, Madagascar\u2019s would be flourishing: a total of 36 were on the island state\u2019s ballot on November 7th. Yet politics in Madagascar, beset by corruption, is far from healthy. Voters hoping for a change from the old elite may be sorely disappointed by the outcome of a race that has been completely dominated by two former presidents.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most visible contender is Andry Rajoelina, who led a coup in 2009 and ruled until 2014. Morondava, a big city in south-west Madagascar, is a sea of posters and T- shirts emblazoned with Mr Rajoelina\u2019s face and sporting his signature bright orange colours. Lorries blaring out his campaign messages are ubiquitous.\n\nEven with such a well-funded campaign, Mr Rajoelina faces stiff competition from Marc Ravalomanana, the president he overthrew in 2009 and who is fondly remembered for a tenure marked by economic growth and investment. The years that followed the coup, by contrast, were catastrophic: the economy dived and poverty shot up. About three-quarters of the population live on less than $1.90 a day.\n\nThe results of the first round will not be announced until later this month. But Messrs Rajoelina and Ravalomanana seem likely to face each other in a run-off on December 19th. Hery Rajaonarimampianina, the incumbent, does not worry them. He lacks the popular appeal of his rivals and has been criticised for failing to revive the economy since he took elected office in 2014. Almost all the other candidates, nicknamed les z\u00e9ros virgule, or \u201cnought point\u201d, after the results they are likely to get, ran with no prospect of winning. They hoped instead to negotiate plum positions in the next administration.\n\nThe outcome of the second round is harder to predict. Mr Rajoelina, who is 44 and once worked as a disc jockey, is popular with the young and with women. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for Rajoelina because he is handsome, cute and young,\u201d says an enthusiastic female voter. But many urbanites deride his madcap schemes, complete with glossy artists\u2019 impressions, to rebuild the country. One proposes making Tamatave, the second-largest city, a new \u201cMiami\u201d.\n\nMr Ravalomanana may lack some of the appeal of his main rival, not to mention his lavish campaign budget, but he is seen as a safer pair of hands. One voter from Tsimafana, a village north of Morondava plagued by cattle rustlers and illegal deforestation, says he will vote for \u201cDada\u201d (Mr Ravalomanana\u2019s affectionate nickname) because the country felt safer during his term in office.\n\nYet few will feel safe until the run-off is over and the count is done. Madagascar has rarely enjoyed a smooth political transition. Many of its people fear that trouble is once again around the corner.", "P EDESTRIANS STROLLING down 8th Avenue in Manhattan\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighbourhood will be struck by the cast-limestone fa\u00e7ade of the Hearst Magazine Building.

Another conspicuous feature is a vast digital screen transmitting advertisements from BuzzFeed, ESPN and Vice. This blend of history and modernity is emblematic of the outdoor-advertising business itself, which, despite being one of the world\u2019s oldest forms of marketing is embracing digital technologies.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost forms of conventional advertising\u2014print, radio and broadcast television\u2014have been losing ground to online ads for years; only billboards, dating back to the 1800s, and TV ads are holding their own (see chart). Such out-of-home ( OOH ) advertising, as it is known, is expected to grow by 3.4% in 2018, and digital out-of-home ( DOOH ) advertising, which includes the LCD screens found in airports and shopping malls, by 16%. Such ads draw viewers\u2019 attention from phones and cannot be skipped or blocked, unlike ads online.\n\nBillboard owners are also making hay from the location data that are pouring off people\u2019s smartphones. Information about their owners\u2019 whereabouts and online browsing gets aggregated and anonymised by carriers and data vendors and sold to media owners. They then use these data to work out when different demographic groups\u2014\u201cbusiness travellers\u201d, say\u2014walk by their ads. That knowledge is added to insights into traffic, weather and other external data to produce highly relevant ads. DOOH providers can deliver ads for coffee when it is cold and fizzy drinks when it is warm. Billboards can be programmed to show ads for allergy medication when the air is full of pollen.\n\nSuch targeting works particularly well when it is accompanied by \u201cprogrammatic\u201d advertising methods, a term that describes the use of data to automate and improve ads. In the past year billboard owners such as Clear Channel and JC Decaux have launched programmatic platforms which allow brands and media buyers to select, purchase and place ads in minutes, rather than days or weeks. Industry boosters say outdoor ads will increasingly be bought like online ones, based on audience and views as well as location.\n\nThat is possible because billboard owners claim to be able to measure how well their ads are working, even though no \u201cclick-through\u201d rates are involved. Data firms can tell advertisers how many people walk past individual advertisements at particular times of the day. Advertisers can estimate how many individuals exposed to an ad for a Louis Vuitton handbag then go on to visit a nearby shop (or website) and buy the product. Such metrics make outdoor ads more data-driven, automated and measurable, argues Michael Provenzano, co-founder of Vistar Media, an ad-tech firm in New York.\n\nAs the outdoor-ad industry becomes more data-driven, tech giants are among those to see more value in it. Netflix recently acquired a string of billboards along Hollywood\u2019s Sunset Strip, where it will start advertising its films and TV shows. Tech firms, among them Apple and Google, are heavy buyers of OOH ads, accounting for 25 of the top 100 OOH ad spenders in America.", "F OR ONCE Italy\u2019s populist government will be pleased to see a group of Africans cross the Mediterranean. On November 12th the leaders of Libya\u2019s warring factions will gather in Palermo, the capital of Sicily, for a two-day peace conference.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItaly has an interest in bringing order to its former colony. Libya is an important source of fossil fuels. Its Greenstream pipeline carries gas from western Libya to Sicily. Less welcome are the 647,000 migrants who are thought to have crossed the Mediterranean to Italy since 2014. Most set off from Libya. Their numbers have recently plummeted\u2014just 22,000 arrived in the first ten months of this year, an 80% drop from last year. But they still rile Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s de facto leader.\n\nMr Salvini will have his work cut out. The situation in Libya is bleak, with the country split between rival militias and UN -led peace talks bogged down. One of the dignitaries in Palermo will be Fayez al-Serraj, head of the UN -backed government. Despite his lofty title, in practice he is little more than the mayor of Tripoli, the capital, which he controls only with the help of allied militias. One of them, from the nearby town of Tarhouna, attacked Tripoli in August over an economic dispute. More than 100 people were killed before the UN negotiated a ceasefire.\n\nThings are little better in the east, ruled by a general-turned-warlord called Khalifa Haftar. Islamist militants still carry out car-bombings and assassinations, while General Haftar undermines state institutions in Tripoli. He controls the strip of coast near Sirte, where Libya\u2019s main oil terminals are located (see map). They are meant to be operated by the Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation. In June, however, the general\u2019s men seized them and announced that revenues would be sent to a rival oil corporation in the east. They withdrew only after America threatened to impose sanctions. In the south, meanwhile, ethnic Tuareg and Toubou militias are battling for control, and criminal gangs from neighbouring Chad prey on civilians.\n\nSo, to put it mildly, things in Libya are not conducive to a peace conference\u2014but Italy is more concerned with the situation in France. Both countries are jockeying for influence. Italy\u2019s interests lie in western Libya, where both the gas pipeline and the migrant boats enter the Mediterranean. It sees Mr Serraj as an ally and has reportedly paid western warlords to stop migrant boats from setting sail. France is happier to work with General Haftar, whom it sees as more likely to stabilise the country. The French army has deployed thousands of its troops to fight jihadists in five former colonies in the adjacent Sahel region.\n\nIn May France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, hosted the Libyan rivals for his own summit. They agreed to hold elections by December 10th. That deadline was always delusional\u2014even ignoring the violence, Libya lacks an electoral law. It also undermined the UN envoy, Ghassan Salam\u00e9, who wants Libyans to hold a national conference and draft a new constitution before holding elections.\n\nBoth Italy and France have commercial motives as well. Libyan oil is cheap to extract and easy to export to Europe. Eni and Total, the Italian and French energy giants, have long competed to produce it. Eni is the largest foreign producer in Libya, but Total is starting to catch up. In March it acquired a 16% stake in the Waha concession in the Sirte basin. If the deal goes through, it could produce 400,000 barrels per day in two or three years. Eni\u2019s CEO , Claudio Descalzi, says he welcomes the \u201chealthy\u201d competition. \u201c[Libya] benefits from this,\u201d he says. The Italian government is less sanguine. It resents French involvement in a country that it sees as in its sphere of influence. Italian politicians accuse Mr Macron of helping General Haftar for Total\u2019s sake.", "W HEN NARENDRA MODI was elected prime minister of India in 2014, his plan was to revive its GDP growth rate back to the near-double-digit figures seen in the mid-2000s. Few would have guessed that the biggest threat to that goal was the financial industry. For several years state-run banks have failed to get to grips with a $100bn mountain of dud loans. Now panic has seized parts of the privately run system. One bank boss says the situation is as bad as the Asian crisis of 1998 or the global crash of 2008.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September IL & FS , a financial firm that owns and finances roads and power plants, defaulted on some of its $13bn of debt. The contagion has struck India\u2019s shadow banks, which rely on $250bn-300bn of borrowing to fund themselves. Their market value has collapsed by a median of 40% this year. A bitter row about how to respond has erupted between the government and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ), the largely independent central bank. Over a billion people depend on an emergency being avoided.\n\nIndia\u2019s financial system has both Chinese and American characteristics; it faces a blend of a slow-motion banking crisis at government-run lenders, plus a high-speed liquidity run of the kind that hit Wall Street in 2008. That the industry has taken on a hybrid character over time reflects the conflicting aims of the forces that shaped it. The state wants pliant banks, ready to lend to the rural poor and to infrastructure projects, and that will buy government bonds. The RBI emphasises stability, so is paranoid about wheeler-dealers taking risks or ripping off the vulnerable. Entrepreneurs want capital and to start financial-services firms themselves. And consumers want loans and whizzy new banking technologies.\n\nAbout half the system, measured by loans, consists of state-run banks. They are usually listed but the government appoints their top brass and often influences them to disastrous effect. Another 25% comes from private banks; some of which are among Asia\u2019s best-run lenders\u2014 HDFC Bank and Kotak trade on about four times their book value, compared with below one times for the zombie state banks. The other quarter is from a motley crew of 50-odd shadow banks that have expanded quickly. They are less heavily regulated and lend in particular areas such as housing. They are usually prohibited from taking deposits so fund themselves with debt. Last, there are innovative digital firms, such as Paytm, a mobile-payments firm. Overall, the system straddles the 19th and 21st centuries, featuring subsiding bank branches protected from the monsoon by tarpaulins, but also virtual mobile chatbots.\n\nThe present troubles have their roots in 2005-12, when state banks went on a lending bender, extending credit to dubious tycoons and to infrastructure projects. Net bad debts are 9% of state banks\u2019 loan books. The government has not properly recapitalised these zombies and the flow of credit from them has slowed. Accidents keep happening. In February PNB , the second-biggest state lender, disclosed a $2bn fraud involving diamond merchants.\n\nA second phase began after 2012. Between 2012 and 2017 more capital flowed into India than flowed out. In 2015 interest rates began to fall and in November 2016 the government replaced the stock of bank notes overnight, leading savers to switch from physical money into deposits with banks, and into debt mutual funds. Flush with cash, and with rates low, they looked for ways to lend the money out again and part of the answer was to fund the shadow banks, which went on a binge\u2014the top 50 have doubled their debts and assets in the past five years. Perhaps as much as $50bn-100bn of their debts comes due within 12 months.\n\nBorrowing short and lending long is a high-stakes game. After the IL&FS collapse, confidence has evaporated. The group has 348 opaque subsidiaries, including India\u2019s longest tunnel. It has now been taken over by the government, which indirectly owned 40% of it. Mutual funds and banks are reluctant to lend to other shadow banks\u2014most report solid capital ratios, but can anyone be sure they do not have time-bombs buried in their balance-sheets? For weeks the shadow banks have faced a liquidity crunch.\n\nThey are big enough to damage India\u2019s entire financial system. Mutual funds, which are sold to the public, have $55bn of exposure to them, or 11% of total assets under management. Conventional banks have loaned $70bn to shadow banks, the equivalent of two-fifths of the former\u2019s core capital. Among private lenders the mood is already jittery: ICICI \u2019s boss has just departed after claims of conflicts of interest (which she denies). Yes Bank is replacing its boss after the RBI refused to approve an extension of his term. Even if a full crisis does not erupt shadow banks may be forced to shrink. When combined with the rotten state banks, that would mean that 75% of India\u2019s financial system is on crutches.\n\nBazooka time\n\nA sell-off in global markets could easily trigger a new wave of panic. The government, facing a general election next year, wants the central bank to lend more freely to the shadow banks. But the RBI does not want to reward failure and has so far injected liquidity only indirectly, by buying government bonds and allowing banks to guarantee some new bonds issued by shadow banks. It blames the government for its endless meddling in state-run lenders and for its failure to recapitalise them, despite years of warning signs.", "\u201cF REE BOBI WINE! \u201d say the graffiti outside his recording studio in Kamwokya, a poor district of Kampala, Uganda\u2019s capital. On August 13th the pop star-turned-politician (pictured above) was arrested and, he says, beaten and tortured by soldiers. Though he was released after two weeks, treason charges still hang over him.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis real crime is being popular. Born Robert Kyagulanyi, Mr Wine speaks for many of Kampala\u2019s roughly 1.5m slum dwellers. \u201cIf parliament cannot come to the ghetto,\u201d he said after his election as an MP , \u201cthe ghetto will come to the parliament.\u201d\n\nMr Wine is part of a broader trend in which upstart politicians with support among the urban poor are rattling governments. They include Kenya\u2019s main opposition leader, Raila Odinga, and Nelson Chamisa of Zimbabwe\u2019s Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ). In South Africa Julius Malema of the Economic Freedom Fighters has been gaining ground by promising to seize white-owned land.\n\nThe past few years have also seen widespread protests by city folk. Witness the \u201cBlack Friday\u201d demonstrations in Lusaka (Zambia\u2019s capital) in 2013 and \u201cRed Friday\u201d marches in Accra (Ghana\u2019s) in 2014, or the post-election riots in Kenya last year.\n\nThe rise of urban discontent and young opposition leaders partly reflects a youth bulge. The median age in Africa is 19.5, whereas its leaders\u2019 average age is 62. It also arises from Africa\u2019s idiosyncratic urbanisation, whereby cities are growing fast but opportunities in them are not.\n\nIn 1960, 15% of Africans lived in cities, about the same as in Europe in the 1600s. Today the share is 38%. By 2030 it will surpass 50%. Africa\u2019s urban population is expanding at a rate of 4% per year, twice the global average. Yet urbanisation is not bringing Africa the prosperity it brought to other continents. In Europe and East Asia the growth of cities was driven by migration from the countryside, as workers swapped fields for factories. African urbanisation is mostly a result of natural population growth. For example, in Maputo, Mozambique\u2019s capital, just 12% of the population rise is accounted for by migration from rural areas. Since there are few manufacturing jobs, most of the growing urban labour force is absorbed by the informal economy. That is one reason why urbanisation in Africa does not reduce poverty as much as it does in other continents.\n\nAnother reason is the woeful way cities are organised. More than 50% of urbanites live in slums. Fully 40% lack flushing toilets. Many capitals still rely on out-of-date planning laws, leading to haphazard building and needlessly expensive rent.\n\nThe neglect, paradoxically, is rooted in democracy. From the end of colonial rule until 1991 no incumbent government was replaced via a peaceful election. Policy-making had an \u201curban bias\u201d. Since the greatest threat to autocrats was a coup, and most coups started in cities, leaders tried to buy off urbanites. This meant, for example, favouring (urban) consumers of food over (rural) producers by keeping prices low.\n\nMuch changed as democracy flowered in the 1990s, and rulers switched to winning support in the populous countryside. In a study of 27 countries, Robin Harding of the University of Oxford found that the advent of democratic elections is associated with increased access to primary school and healthier children, but only in rural areas. Other studies show skewed spending on rural roads and on farm subsidies.\n\nUrbanites have many reasons for being less likely than rural voters to back those in power. They have better access to news and can be organised more easily by activists. Using polls taken in 28 countries Mr Harding has found that city dwellers are on average five percentage points more likely to oppose the government than rural voters are. This is true even after controlling for age, gender, education and whether voters share the ethnicity of the country\u2019s leader.\n\nPoliticians mindful of urban unhappiness perhaps stand a better chance of success. Mr Wine\u2019s music evokes slum life. In one song he protests against the heavy-handed arrest of street traders. In another he sings about kikomando, a humble snack of chapati and beans eaten by the poor. He slips naturally into Luyaaye, a street slang. By contrast, Yoweri Museveni, the 74-year-old Ugandan president who won just 31% of the vote in Kampala in 2016, sprinkles his speech with rustic idioms. Young urbanites call him \u201cBosco\u201d, after a character in an advert, a country bumpkin who comes to the city and stumbles down escalators with his bicycle.\n\nSuch politicians hope to emulate Michael Sata, perhaps the most successful African populist. Sata, who was Zambia\u2019s president from 2011 until his death in 2014, coupled an appeal to his ethnic Bemba group in the countryside with a pro-poor message in cities. During electioneering he spoke in the vernacular. He launched campaigns from informal markets, not plush hotels. One of the first things he did in office was to order town clerks to stop harassing street vendors.\n\nElsewhere vendors have been less lucky. Some of the most violent incidents have taken place in Zimbabwe, where thousands of street traders in MDC strongholds have been arrested in operations co-ordinated by the ruling party, Zanu- PF .\n\nIncumbents are also trying more subtle ways to quell urban unrest. In Mozambique cities run by opposition parties are starved of public funds. In Botswana the ruling party has appointed extra unelected councillors to cities where the opposition has polled well. In Uganda Mr Museveni has transferred many powers from the opposition-led city council to his appointees.\n\nYet at some point the size of the urban voting bloc will become too big to ignore. In countries where more than half the people live in cities, urbanites are only a little less satisfied with democracy than rural voters are (see chart), suggesting that politicians do eventually take more notice of city dwellers\u2019 interests. But for now, in countries such as Uganda, where three-quarters of people still live in rural areas, politicians will make mainly half-hearted attempts to please those in cities.", "A PUNGENT ODOUR of dried fish and the cries of merchants fill the cavernous central market, which locals in this southern Russian city still lovingly refer to as \u201cthe old bazaar\u201d. Commerce is in the blood here. \u201cIf a man doesn\u2019t want to earn money, then what is he doing on this earth?\u201d guffaws Galya, who hawks pork. Rows of sellers reflect a multicultural history: Armenians, Georgians, Greeks, and even Korean women peddling kimchi. Down the hill from the market, the river Don beckons; on the city\u2019s left bank, barges with piles of grain await their departure for foreign shores. \u201cThe south is more alive,\u201d says Inna, a fishmonger. \u201cIt\u2019s like the fish: when she swims in clean water, her eyes sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA city with roots as a trading hub, Rostov-on-Don has preserved its entrepreneurial spirit. \u201cThe Russian south is the model of a future Russia,\u201d argues Sergei Smirnov, CEO of Center-Invest, the largest regional bank. \u201cWe don\u2019t have oil, but we do have agriculture, tourism, transport and small business.\u201d Although Russia\u2019s GDP growth is slow at around 1.5% a year, the Rostov region is humming along at twice that pace, powered by booming farming, retooled manufacturing and an active citizenry. In Rostov-on-Don, the regional capital known simply as \u201cRostov\u201d (or \u201cRostov Papa\u201d, a name from its days as a criminal capital), \u201cpeople bustle about and try to make things happen, which is a very big difference\u201d from other similarly sized cities, says Natalia Zubarevich, an expert on Russia\u2019s regions.\n\nThe combination of geography, tradition and mild weather makes Rostov among Russia\u2019s most entrepreneurial cities. As Yuri Bogdanov, Center-Invest\u2019s director of innovation, says: \u201cCities developed around these southern markets.\u201d Even 70 years of Soviet life could not snuff out the instinct: when Mikhail Gorbachev legalised co-operatives as part of perestroika, Gloria Jeans, Russia\u2019s first producer of blue jeans and one of its largest clothing firms to this day, opened in Rostov. In Rostov, 44% of the workforce is employed in small and medium-sized businesses, compared with a dismal 25% nationally.\n\nThe regional governor, Vasily Golubev, also has a business-friendly message. \u201cWe\u2019re open for investors, including foreigners,\u201d he declares, a statement that might seem discordant in an era of sanctions and with a war simmering just across the border in eastern Ukraine. It helps that Rostov\u2019s main industries largely lie outside the purview of Western sanctions, which have focused on energy, finance and the arms trade. A further boost comes from a gleaming new international airport and a network of refurbished roads, built ahead of last summer\u2019s World Cup, when Rostov was one of 11 host cities.\n\nRostov\u2019s pitch includes a mix of old and new. Rather than dying, some Soviet giants here retooled. Industrial production in the region was up by 7% last year. Ms Zubarevich calls it \u201ca new post-Soviet re-industrialisation\u201d. Take Rostselmash, a hulking agricultural-equipment producer founded by the Bolsheviks in the 1920s. On the brink of failure in the 1990s, these days Rostselmash has been enjoying a revival. Agriculture is one of the rare bright spots in the Russian economy, helped along by government subsidies and counter-sanctions that banned food imports from the West. In 2016 Russia became the world\u2019s largest wheat exporter. Rostselmash now sells to more than 35 countries and opened its first office in Germany last year. When Vladimir Putin gathered his advisers for a meeting on the development of regional industry earlier this year, they met at Rostselmash.\n\nBeyond the old industry, a younger post-Soviet generation hopes to reorient Rostov. The C 52 creative cluster, an abandoned factory transformed into a hip multi-use space, offers a glimpse of the vision. Now streetwear shops and a yoga studio fill the first-floor retail space. A central hall for events and film screenings features a \u201cthird-wave brew bar\u201d, where a dreadlocked barista pontificates on the particularities of Ethiopian and Guatemalan coffee blends. Young programmers and designers sit hunched over laptops in the upper-floor offices. Alexander Kuleshov, C 52\u2019s owner, has been shifting towards IT and design firms with global client bases: following the devaluation of the Russian rouble in 2014, such outsourcing became good business. Like many of his tenants, Mr Kuleshov is determined to stick around town. \u201cI\u2019m proud that I\u2019m not leaving, that I\u2019m doing something here,\u201d he says.\n\nUltimately Rostov remains subject to the same challenges that plague Russia at large. Overzealous inspectors squeeze business. Mr Kuleshov laments a fine he received for painting his residents\u2019 logos on a wall facing the street, which the police claimed was illegal graffiti. Exporters gripe about the chilling effect of sanctions on business relationships. At the central market, Galya grumbles about rising petrol prices. Inna rues that in recent years her customers have been buying fewer crayfish, the local delicacy. \u201cTimes are tough and people are in debt,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the end we all live in one country.\u201d", "A CROSS THE country, some children are becoming victims, others perpetrators. On November 3rd a 15-year-old was stabbed in the chest in Swindon. Two days later, an 18-year-old was knifed in the leg outside a school in Bedford. On November 6th two teenagers suspected of stabbing a younger boy in Manchester were arrested. The boy was struck several times in front of other children out for Halloween.\n\nBut the media has focused on London, where there have been 119 murders this year, about the same as the number killed in the whole of 2017, excluding terrorist attacks. Four in ten victims were 24 or younger. In the six days from October 31st, there were five fatal stabbings in the capital. The hosts of \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d, a television programme, berated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. \u201cSort it out, Mr Mayor!\u201d one said.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis narrow focus is partly justified. Stabbings are far more common in London than anywhere else in the country, and not only because it is so much bigger: it sees more violence per person than less populous areas. In 2017-18 it accounted for 22% of all murders and 36% of knife crime in England and Wales, though Londoners make up 15% of the population. Attacks in the capital also appear to be more ferocious than those elsewhere. Its murder count has risen more sharply than the country\u2019s.\n\nYet the biggest increases in knife crime have been outside London (see chart). Since 2010-11 it has risen by a tenth in the capital, and by a third in the rest of England and Wales. During the same period, knife crime leapt more sharply than the national average in the patches around Sheffield, Leeds and Liverpool. The number of stabbings began to tick up in North Wales, Norfolk and Essex well before they did in London. Jacqueline Sebire, assistant chief constable of Bedfordshire Police, recently dealt with four stabbings in 24 hours. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that people are placing the sole focus on London,\u201d she says.\n\nSome think the capital dominates coverage because of its concentration of journalists and politicians. They are \u201cseeing it more visibly than the trends outside London,\u201d says Harvey Redgrave of Crest Advisory, a consultancy. Mr Khan and Cressida Dick, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, are well known and so more likely to be held to account than a provincial police chief or politician. Others suspect politics. Tory-supporting newspapers have been quick to criticise Mr Khan, a Labour mayor who will have to fight an election campaign in a little over a year.\n\nThe best explanations for the surge are national. Labour blames spending cuts: the number of policemen has fallen by 15% since 2010. Meanwhile new demands on officers, such as a recent run of accusations of decades-old sex abuse, take up their time. Another plausible explanation is a shift in the drugs market. A boom in the supply of crack cocaine has encouraged city gangsters to expand into towns once dominated by small-time dealers. Competition has sparked violent turf wars.\n\nMisdiagnosing the spread of the problem could frustrate attempts to tackle it. \u201cA lot of police forces just want to deal with problems on their own patch,\u201d says Rick Muir of the Police Foundation, a think-tank. \u201cYou need to look at it as a national problem.\u201d Mr Khan might be feeling the heat, but responsibility ultimately rests with the Home Office.", "\u201cF RIEDRICH THE great\u201d roared one headline. The hype that attended the surprise declaration by Friedrich Merz, a politician-turned-businessman, that he would run for the leadership of Germany\u2019s Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) may have been a trifle overdone. But as Angela Merkel\u2019s long reign as chancellor draws to a close, Mr Merz\u2019s gambit has exposed the party\u2019s thirst for political novelty. Mrs Merkel\u2019s decision on October 29th to vacate the CDU leadership, a position she has held for 18 years, has unleashed passions that some Germans had forgotten they had. \u201cThe CDU lives!\u201d gushed a party vice-chairman.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first blush, the 62-year-old Mr Merz seems a curious agent of renewal. A longtime CDU man from a small town near Dortmund, in Germany\u2019s west, he earned his spurs as a fearsome parliamentarian in the 1990s. But in 2002 he was felled as floor leader of the parliamentary party by Mrs Merkel, whose ambition he had underestimated. He left the Bundestag in 2009 for a lucrative career in law and finance, although he kept one foot in politics, notably as chairman of Atlantic Bridge, a body that fosters links between Europe and America. Over the years, as frustration with Mrs Merkel spread inside the CDU, Mr Merz grew used to batting away questions on his political ambitions.\n\nYet for many in the party\u2019s conservative base, says Ruprecht Polenz, a former CDU general secretary, he remained a \u201cprojection screen\u201d. Where Mrs Merkel was cautious and consensual, he is spiky and combative. Her gestures to the left won votes from Germany\u2019s Social Democrats ( SPD ) but irritated many in her own camp; Mr Merz once claimed Germany\u2019s tax code should be simple enough to fit on a beer mat. His comment, in 2000, that immigrants should adapt to German Leitkultur (leading culture), is fondly recalled by conservatives who have not forgiven Mrs Merkel for letting in over 1m migrants in 2015-16. Some of the 1,001 delegates who will gather in Hamburg to elect Mrs Merkel\u2019s successor next month may even secretly feel that 18 years of being led by a woman is enough.\n\nYet for all that, Mr Merz is unlikely to present himself as the candidate of rupture. Despite the sense of torpor under Mrs Merkel, it remains a minority view in the CDU that renewal demands a sharp rightward turn. (Jens Spahn, a young rival to Mr Merz who best represents that camp, has already been written off by many commentators.) At a press conference announcing his candidacy, Mr Merz seemed more interested in attacking the fringes of German politics than in bolstering his conservative bona fides.\n\nMr Merz also raised eyebrows by suggesting that Germany should have provided a more constructive response to the European reforms proposed by Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president. That followed his decision to sign an open letter by a group of German dignitaries urging such European reforms as a common army and an unemployment-insurance fund. Some of these ideas may alienate precisely those party members who have supported Mr Merz\u2019s candidacy most vocally.\n\nHis CV presents a second potential difficulty, notes one CDU deputy. Unlike Mr Spahn, who has served in the finance and health ministries, or Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the other leading candidate, who has run one of Germany\u2019s states, Mr Merz has no administrative experience to speak of. That counts against him. Few observers believe Mrs Merkel\u2019s stated wish to serve out her term as chancellor until 2021 will be granted should Mr Merz become party leader. If she goes early, the fraying coalition could collapse, leaving Mr Merz scrambling to form a new government or holding an early election.", "O N NOVEMBER 6TH the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates health and social care, took the unusual step of warning local authorities that a care company was at risk of collapse. Allied Healthcare, which provides services such as washing and meals to 9,300 elderly people in their own homes, insists there is nothing to worry about. Yet councils are preparing for the worst.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllied\u2019s difficulties are a reminder of the pressure on the care sector. A higher minimum wage and tighter regulations have added to care providers\u2019 costs. At the same time their main customers, local authorities, are facing funding cuts and are reluctant to pay more for services.\n\nThis disjuncture is most evident in care homes, a business worth about \u00a316bn ($21bn) a year, with over 400,000 residents. The number of people over 85 is expected to increase by 36% by 2025. Yet care homes have been closing, unable to make ends meet. By one estimate England has lost 3,700 beds since 2012.\n\nIt hardly looks like a promising market. But one corner of the industry has attracted the attention of investors, including foreign funds, which have been snapping up British care homes. By changing the way such homes operate, and rethinking who their customers are, investors see a way to make a good return. But with this change comes a widening gap between north and south, as well as between rich and poor.\n\nTake Skylark House in Horsham, Sussex. The spotless, two-year-old facility has 82 bedrooms, each with an en-suite wetroom and most with a balcony. It is owned by Care UK , the fourth-largest provider in the country, which has built 40 homes since 2011 and has 33 more in the pipeline.\n\nCare UK\u2019 s boss, Andrew Knight, argues that the only way to provide this sort of care is to take more residents who pay their own way. Councils in England are obliged to pay for anyone with assets of under \u00a314,250. But often the council\u2019s contribution does not cover the full cost. In Care UK \u2019 s homes, councils pay about \u00a3650 a week, whereas \u201cself-funders\u201d pay \u00a3900. Care UK used to work mostly for local authorities. Now half its residents are self-funders. Mr Knight says he will no longer provide beds at below cost. That will rule out most local-authority customers, but means the company can operate with margins of about 10%.\n\nThe self-funding market has caught the eye of American investors, primarily real-estate investment trusts ( REITS ). The biggest in Britain is Welltower, which has 107 care homes with 7,500 beds, worth \u00a32.2bn. Only a few of its homes take council-funded residents, as the firm prefers to \u201cavoid the risks of dealing with the government pay sector,\u201d says Justin Skiver, an executive. Other REITS buying homes include Target Healthcare and Impact Healthcare.\n\nThe care-homes market is still fragmented, with about 5,500 operators. The five biggest have just 15% of the market between them. Some see scope to grow by acquisition, gaining economies of scale.\n\nThe investments will increase capacity and may spur innovation. But the price is a bigger divide between those who can pay and those who cannot. And there may be a hidden cost to the taxpayer. As providers focus on self-funders and council-funded beds dry up, hospitals could find themselves taking up the slack.", "T HE DOWN-AT-HEEL neighbourhood of Exarchia in central Athens, known for its lively bars and tavernas, has long been home to a small but disruptive community of self-described anarchists. Violent street battles take place at weekends: extremists throw Molotov cocktails at police, who respond with tear gas. Long-suffering residents say their complaints are routinely ignored by the authorities.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne anarchist group, Rouvikonas (Rubicon), uses more sophisticated tactics to make its presence felt. Based in a cinema-cum-bar close to Exarchia\u2019s central square, populated with drug pushers and sellers of bootleg cigarettes, Rouvikonas stages nuisance attacks against embassies, government buildings and the offices of multinational companies. Its members are not usually arrested. Prosecutors dismiss their actions as \u201ctoo insignificant\u201d to justify full-fledged investigation.\n\nRouvikonas\u2019s victims would disagree. In recent months, its activists have fired paintballs at the Turkish, French and Austrian embassies; destroyed newly installed electronic ticket barriers at Athens metro stations; and smashed glass doors at the offices of Novartis, a Swiss pharmaceuticals firm. Many observers believe the Syriza government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras tolerates Rouvikonas\u2019s activities, hoping to reassure left-wing voters that despite carrying out harsh austerity policies prescribed by Greece\u2019s international creditors, the party is still at heart a radical movement. When police officers arrested several Rouvikonas members who broke into parliament last year, Nikos Voutsis, the Speaker, called up the citizens\u2019 protection minister and ordered their immediate release on the grounds that \u201cit was a simple act of protest\u201d.\n\nCounter-terrorism experts worry, however, that the group is becoming a training school for extremists. Some members of Rouvikonas have connections with the Conspiracy of Fire Cells, a group that in 2010 sent a clutch of letter-bombs addressed to European politicians, among them Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. Its leaders are now serving long jail terms, but another alleged member is awaiting trial on charges of sending a booby-trapped parcel in 2017 to Lucas Papademos, a technocrat who was also briefly prime minister during the euro crisis. Mr Papademos was seriously wounded while opening the package in his car.", "I N 2016 AYO ADEWUNMI , a Nigerian-born agricultural trader living in London, bought a five-hectare farm in his homeland. It has produced little since. \u201cI am not in the country, so I have to rely on third parties. It\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d he says.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Adewunmi has since discovered another, potentially more satisfactory way to make such investments: through FarmCrowdy, a crowdfunding platform that lends to Nigerian farms and provides technical assistance to their owners. The two-year-old startup, which is considering expanding into Ghana, places high hopes in the African diaspora as a source of funds.\n\nThe case for such platforms goes beyond agriculture. Global remittances are expected to soar from $468bn in 2010 to $667bn in 2019. They are among the top two foreign-currency sources in several countries, including Kenya and the Philippines. Yet hardly any of the money is invested.\n\nIn part, this is because recipients use three-quarters of the money for basics such as food and housing. But it is also because emigrants who want to invest back home have few options. New investment channels could attract lots of extra cash\u2014about $73bn a year in Commonwealth countries alone, according to research by the 53-country grouping.\n\nCrowdfunding platforms would enable investors to put modest sums directly into smaller businesses in developing countries, which are often cash-starved. Yet of the emerging world\u2019s 85 debt- and equity-crowdfunding ventures, only a handful raise money abroad. Several platforms set up in rich countries over the past decade to invest in developing countries, including Emerging Crowd, Homestrings and Enable Impact, quickly folded.\n\nA big problem is that few developing countries have rules about crowdfunding. Many have allowed activity so far chiefly because the industry is so small, says Anton Root of Allied Crowds, a consultancy. Cross-border transfers using such platforms easily fall foul of rich countries\u2019 rules intended to stop money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nSome developing countries have realised that they need to act. Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia have all recently passed regulations on equity crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending. But from a cross-border perspective, Africa seems most inventive, owing to active entrepreneurs and Western help.\n\nLast month the British government approved a grant of \u00a3230,000 ($300,000) to the African Crowdfunding Association to help it craft model accreditation and investor-protection rules. Elizabeth Howard of LelapaFund, a platform focused on east Africa, is part of an effort to see such rules adopted across the continent. That would help reassure sending countries that transfers do not end up in the wrong hands, she says. She hopes to enlist the support of the Central Bank of West African States, which oversees eight Francophone countries, at a gathering of crowdfunders and regulators sponsored by the French government in Dakar, in Senegal, this month.\n\nThameur Hemdane of Afrikwity, a platform targeting Francophone Africa, says the industry will also study whether prospective laws could be expanded to the Central African Economic and Monetary Community, a grouping of six countries. Harmonised rules will not guarantee crowdfunders\u2019 success, but would be a useful step towards raising the amount of diaspora capital that is put to productive use.", "\u201cI SEE PATIENTS every day who are going to have babies because they work at Facebook,\u201d says Peter Klatsky of Spring Fertility clinic in Silicon Valley. Tech giants now include egg-freezing and in vitro fertilisation in their employees\u2019 health coverage. But even as high-earning Americans have the cost of making a baby covered by their companies, many low earners cannot get paid leave to look after theirs.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the end of the first world war, American workers have seen a steady rise in benefits. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, \u201csupplements\u201d to wages, which include most of today\u2019s benefits but exclude performance bonuses, rose from 1.4% of total compensation in 1917 to 17.5% in 2000. Using a broader measure that includes performance bonuses as well as paid leave, overtime, health insurance and contributions to retirement plans, that share has risen further since: from 27% of compensation in 2000 to 32% now.\n\nWhen growth in wages slowed after the financial crisis, so did growth in benefits. Another trend also became apparent: a widening gap between rich and poor. Workers at the tenth percentile for wages saw benefits fall by around 2% in real terms between 2009 and 2018. Those at the 90th percentile saw a rise of 17% (see chart).\n\nWage growth has picked up recently as the labour market has tightened. Figures released on November 2nd showed that 250,000 jobs were added across America during October, and that average wages grew at an annual rate of 3.1%, the fastest since the financial crisis. By the end of the summer, there were over a million more unfilled positions than jobless Americans.\n\nBut growth in benefits for lower earners has remained sluggish. One reason is that few get employer-provided health insurance, which has accounted for about a third of the increasing cost of employers\u2019 benefits since 2000. Just one in four of those in the bottom 25% by earnings are covered, compared with three in four in the top 25%.Those working in the gig economy lose out on conventional benefits such as pension contributions. Meanwhile, at the top end of the labour market, bonuses are increasingly being used to retain the most prized workers. Aon Hewitt, a human-resources consultancy, finds that over four decades bonuses have grown to a record high, reaching 12.8% of payroll in 2014.\n\nThe gap is likely to be wider still when intangible benefits are included. The share of Fortune 1,000 companies with shorter hours on \u201csummer Fridays\u201d has doubled, to 42%, since 2015. Salesforce, a software giant, gives employees several paid days off per year for volunteering, and $1,000 to donate to a cause of their choice. Since such perks are more common at tech firms and in offices, low-paid workers often miss out. Unionised workers, who have more leverage with employers, choose to receive a notably larger share of their compensation as benefits than non-unionised ones. In a survey of American workers by FRACTL , a content-marketing firm, 88% said they would sacrifice a higher wage for better health insurance and more flexible hours.\n\nThe hope for low earners lies in the fact that they are often the last to gain from expansions. As the labour market has tightened, their wage growth has accelerated sharply. They may soon start to feel the benefit beyond their pay cheques, too.", "W HEN A PANEL of three judges on Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court overturned a poor Christian woman\u2019s conviction for blasphemy, which carries a mandatory death sentence, it was, as one commentator, Zahid Hussain, put it, as if they had at last broken the country\u2019s \u201cring of fear\u201d. Nine years ago in the fields, Asia Bibi, a mother of five, had taken a sip of water before passing the jug on to fellow (Muslim) fruit-pickers. They said they could not share a drinking vessel with an \u201cunclean\u201d Christian, and demanded she convert to Islam. She refused, and soon a mob was accusing her of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPakistan\u2019s main blasphemy law is breathtakingly sweeping. Anyone who defiles Muhammad\u2019s name, even if \u201cby imputation, innuendo or insinuation\u201d, faces death. Since its introduction in 1986, several hundred people have been charged, with a disproportionate number either non-Muslims or Ahmadis, a persecuted sect who revere both Muhammad and a 19th-century prophet\u2014something many other Muslims consider abominable. No one has yet been executed. But more than 50 people accused of blasphemy have been murdered. Two politicians were assassinated just for speaking up for Ms Asia. One of them, Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot by his bodyguard.\n\nSo the judges\u2019 decision was brave. The charges against Ms Asia, they said, were \u201cconcoction incarnate\u201d. The reaction of hard-core Islamists, meanwhile, was predictable. Muhammad Afzal Qadri, a founder of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan ( TLP ), a fast-expanding political party formed in response to the hanging of Mr Taseer\u2019s bodyguard, called for the three judges to be killed. Supporters poured onto the streets, bringing cities to a halt with blockades of burning tyres and shutting down the motorway between Islamabad, the capital, and Lahore, the country\u2019s second-biggest city.\n\nIt was enough for Ms Asia\u2019s defence lawyer to flee the country. Yet the judges\u2019 courage, for one gripping moment, was backed up in an unlikely quarter\u2014by the prime minister himself. Campaigning before the election in July that brought him to power, Imran Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, had voiced support for the blasphemy laws. Yet on state television, Mr Khan, while on a begging trip to China, warned the protesters that \u201cthe government will not stand aside and see property and livelihoods being destroyed. Do not force us to take action.\u201d It was assumed that Mr Khan, whose rise to power came with the army\u2019s support, had the generals\u2019 backing to take on groups that hold the country hostage.\n\nAlas, the resolve seemed to disappear almost as soon as it was broadcast. To get the TLP off the streets, the government promised to put Ms Asia on the list of people forbidden to leave the country while a review of the judges\u2019 ruling takes place. It said arrested TLP agitators would be freed. And it conspicuously refused to criticise Mr Qadri and his toxic fellow-leader, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, a preacher. Ms Asia, meanwhile, remained in prison. As well as the judges\u2019 murder, the TLP has called for the army to mutiny. Yet for the umpteenth time, the state was appeasing extremists, supposedly in the name of avoiding bloodshed.\n\nThe capitulation won not just Mr Khan but the army, under General Qamar Javed Bajwa, a barrage of brickbats. The failure to prevent mayhem made them look weak. Back in 2014 the army at last turned on armed extremists whom it had once fostered as a useful tool foreign-policy tool, after a horrific attack by the Pakistani Taliban on an army school. But the army has been reluctant to confront the (unarmed) TLP . Its roots are in the Barelvi movement of Islam, which the generals cultivate as a counterbalance to the even more doctrinaire Deobandis of the Pakistani Taliban. Besides, General Bajwa is on the defensive after Mr Qadri accused him of being a closet Ahmadi.", "W HEN OPPOSING political parties both think they are winning, one of them is usually wrong. This is the quandary America finds itself in, after the Democrats won the House of Representatives in the suburbs, while the Republicans tightened their grip on the Senate in the sticks. It also describes the attitudes of both parties towards the most divisive issue of the Trump era: immigration. Whipped up by a frenzied nativist intervention by President Donald Trump, including a closing TV ad so racist that even Fox News would not air it, most Republicans ran on the issue in the mid-terms. Democrats mostly tried to ignore it. Who was right?\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe picture, again, looks mixed. The most virulent nativists lost, including a trio of Trump wannabes, Lou Barletta and Corey Stewart, Senate candidates in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and Kris Kobach, the Republican running for governor in Kansas. So did prominent Democrats who took the opposite tack\u2014including Andrew Gillum and Beto O\u2019Rourke, liberal darlings in Florida and Texas, both of whom wanted to rearrange the Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agency. But all had tough races. The broader conclusion from the mid-terms is that, on immigration and otherwise, both parties turned out their voters, extending their territory a bit, without taking from the other. It is tempting to see this as a validation of both their immigration strategies.\n\nExit polls, which suggested about half of voters liked Mr Trump\u2019s immigration policies or wanted tougher ones, also support that. So do interviews with Democratic strategists. None thought Mr Trump\u2019s late onslaught, which also included dispatching a small army to defend America against a weary column of Honduran asylum-seekers, had hurt their party. Several noted that his immigration policies, including his putative border wall, caging of migrant children and threat to deport 800,000 immigrants, known as DREAMERS , who were brought to America illegally as children, are all unpopular. Such complacency, on the issue that fuelled Mr Trump\u2019s rise, on which Democrats remain most vulnerable to him and, for that matter, on which liberals are falling across the Western world, feels like a death-wish.\n\nIt ignores how asymmetrically the two parties are affected by partisanship, in which attitudes towards immigration, the most polarising issue, play a big part. The bumper representation given to small states in the Senate means Democrats need to win more conservative places than Republicans need to win progressive ones. And they cannot win there on scrapping ICE . The harder line taken by Democratic senators running in such states illustrated that. In Indiana Joe Donnelly declared himself a fan of the wall; in Missouri Claire McCaskill said she liked the sound of \u201cOperation Faithful Patriot\u201d, as Mr Trump\u2019s fatuous troop deployment was called. Yet both lost, because in the end voters reckoned they were Democrats\u2014the party, according to Mr Trump, of open borders.\n\nIt is not possible to say this was the reason for their defeat. But it is likely, because of another sort of immigration-related asymmetry. Only a handful of voters understand the details of immigration policy. Why otherwise do voters in West Virginia, where immigrants are rarer than millionaires, worry about them so much? Rather, as that example suggests, the issue is a repository for broader anxieties and allegiances. Even conservatives who think Mr Trump\u2019s promised wall is nuts are keen on the sense of security, nationalism and contempt for liberal feelings it is meant to impart. Democratic opposition to Mr Trump\u2019s draconian measures, which conservatives hear as the bleating of a party weak on security and captured by Hispanic activists, makes them even more appealing. In the hands of a skilled opportunist like Mr Trump, immigration is scarcely a policy problem at all. It is a means to rally nativist sentiment to win power.\n\nRepublicans maintain that, to the contrary, it is the Democrats who have commandeered the issue for political purposes. They are right to a degree. As the Democrats have become more dependent on Hispanic voters, they have become much keener to discuss migrant rights than border enforcement. Hillary Clinton barely mentioned it in 2016. And the fact that few Democratic mid-term candidates would say how many Hondurans should be allowed, or denied, entry revealed the same failing. Yet the conspiracy theory this has fuelled on the right\u2014that Democrats are trying to boost illegal immigration to swell their electorate\u2014is a fantasy.\n\nRecent Democratic administrations have built as much border fortification as Republican ones. Barack Obama, the symbol of his party\u2019s non-white coalition, deported more illegal immigrants than his predecessors. Last year Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, offered to secure $25bn for Mr Trump\u2019s border wall in return for protection for the DREAMERS . The Democrats\u2019 main error on immigration is not to have been too political about it, but the opposite. They have primarily viewed immigration as a policy problem, to be unpicked through bipartisan compromise. Mr Trump\u2019s response to Mr Schumer, which was to demand more draconian restrictions, including a cut in legal immigration and no more \u201cshithole\u201d Africans, should have disabused them of that. The president does not want a big bipartisan deal on immigration. He wants to keep it as a campaign issue.\n\nSandbagged by unreality\n\nBy ignoring immigration, the Democrats will let him have it\u2014and when his name is on the ballot, in 2020, the onslaught will be fiercer. They need to redefine the issue, to draw some of its poison. That should start with a realisation that a party unwilling to speak of immigration as a security issue, as well as a humanitarian one, is unacceptable in much of America. A statement of zero tolerance for illegal immigration and a willingness to accelerate the processing of asylum claims could help relay that. Democrats need to take the politics of immigration more seriously. Mr Trump has sandbagged them with it once\u2014and could easily do so again.", "T HESE DAYS Manuel Machado has a spring in his step. The school of which he is headmaster, Escola Portuguesa de Macau, is the only one in the southern Chinese city that still follows the curriculum taught in Portugal, which until 1999 had held sway in Macau, more or less, for nearly four-and-a-half centuries. What gives Mr Machado cheer is that enrolment has been rising for the past three years. The school now has more than 600 pupils. He predicts the trend will continue.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is certainly plenty of room for catch-up growth. When the school was founded in 1998, a year before Portugal handed Macau back to China, it had nearly twice as many students (and there were at least three other such schools through much of the 1990s). The vast majority of pupils were children of Portuguese expatriates, who then dominated the senior ranks of Macau\u2019s public sector. Today the school\u2019s fastest-growing ethnic group is Chinese.\n\nOnly 2.3% of the city\u2019s 660,000 people claim fluency in Portuguese (about 1.8% of them are wholly or partly ethnic Portuguese). But the language is still in official use, along with Chinese, of which the local spoken form is Cantonese. In recent years interest in Portuguese has surged. The number of students taking courses in it at Instituto Portugu\u00eas do Oriente, a Macau-based cultural centre backed by the Portuguese government, was around 5,000 last year, more than double the figure in 2012. Many are officials who want to \u201creach the top\u201d of Macau\u2019s government, says Joaquim Ramos, the centre\u2019s director. In its economic plan for 2016-20, Macau\u2019s government pledged to \u201cgive priority to guaranteeing employment\u201d for \u201ctalented people who are bilingual in Chinese and Portuguese\u201d. It promised to boost subsidies for those studying Portuguese at university.\n\nAt present most civil servants can speak good English, but few have even passable Portuguese. That is partly because Portuguese was never a compulsory subject in most schools. So why the growth of interest in it? The answer lies in China\u2019s burgeoning trade with the Lusophone world, about three-quarters of which is with Brazil. In 2003 the central government founded an organisation called Forum Macau to boost such commerce. Every three or four years government ministers from member countries gather in the eponymous city, which like nearby Hong Kong\u2014a former British colony\u2014is now a \u201cspecial administrative region\u201d of China. Last year China traded goods worth $118bn with the forum\u2019s foreign participants (eight of them, since the African state of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe joined in 2017, having severed its ties with Taiwan). This amount was still relatively small\u2014only 3% of China\u2019s total trade in goods. But it was nearly 30% higher than in the previous year.\n\nA young native of Macau who prefers to be identified by his surname, Ho, says he wants to be an interpreter for a Chinese company with interests in Portugal or Lusophone Africa, such as Mozambique or Angola. Perhaps anticipating the needs of people like him, the University of Macau recently opened, to much fanfare, a \u201cbilingual teaching and training centre\u201d. It offers Portuguese-language workshops tailored for professionals.\n\nFor Mr Ho, the decision to take up Portuguese is also a personal matter. The language is \u201cpart of Macau\u2019s identity\u201d, he notes. Since around 2011 residents have rated their identity as citizens of Macau as being stronger than their Chinese identity, according to annual surveys by the University of Hong Kong (the year 2015 was an exception). Native-born youngsters, who have no memory of Portuguese rule, are especially proud of Macau\u2019s Portuguese heritage, Mr Ho says. A similar kind of \u201clocalism\u201d, as it is often described, is also on the rise in Hong Kong. There, however, it is intermingled with demands for greater democracy or even outright secession from China. Happily for the government in Beijing, the people of Macau show little interest in pushing the case for either.", "T HE INSTITUTE of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era occupies several rooms in the Marxism department of Renmin University in north Beijing. Qin Xuan, the institute\u2019s director, says it is one of ten similar centres for the study of the philosophy that is attributed to China\u2019s president. The institute has only a small administrative staff but about 70 affiliated academics. It produces research, offers advice to policymakers and organises seminars.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Qin says that part of his team\u2019s job is to explain Xi Thought to journalists, foreign diplomats and Chinese youngsters. In October he and researchers at other such institutes, all founded in the past year, appeared as judges and commentators on a youth-targeted game-show called \u201cStudying the New Era\u201d. It involved students who stood on the bridge of a starship and answered questions, posed by an animated robot, about Mr Xi\u2019s speeches and biography. The show was part of an unusually lively series of programmes about ideology called \u201cSocialism is Kind of Cool\u201d, produced by a provincial television station.\n\nA year has passed since Mr Xi, at a five-yearly Communist Party congress, declared that China had entered a \u201cnew era\u201d and outlined how the party should manage this. The congress gave its rubber-stamp approval and revised the party\u2019s charter to enshrine Mr Xi\u2019s thinking on the topic as one of its guiding ideologies (he and Mao are the only ones named in the document as having Thought with a capital T\u2014a mere Theory is ascribed to Deng Xiaoping).\n\nSince Mr Xi took power six years ago, his aim has been fairly clear: to boost the party\u2019s control over China\u2019s fast-changing society while enhancing the country\u2019s influence globally. But his Thought is woolly: a hodgepodge of Dengist and Maoist terminology combined with mostly vague ideas on topics ranging from the environment (making China \u201cbeautiful\u201d) to building a \u201cworld-class\u201d army.\n\nCartographic contortions\n\nXi Thought is now being \u201chammered home harder\u201d than any set of ideas since Deng launched his \u201creform and opening\u201d policy nearly 40 years ago, says Kerry Brown of King\u2019s College, London. Most universities have incorporated lectures on the topic into the basic-level ideology courses which all Chinese students are required to take. Some have created additional elective courses for undergraduates. This academic year high schools have been supplied with new materials to help them teach it, too.\n\nThe indoctrination effort extends well beyond academia. In May the party\u2019s propaganda department published a 355-page, 30-chapter book which it said provided an \u201cin-depth\u201d understanding of Xi Thought. It said every party cell must study the work. Last month the party\u2019s mouthpiece, the People\u2019s Daily, published on social media a labyrinthine mind-map based on the book (for a high-resolution image of this map, see economist.com/xismind). It is so packed with ideas and quotations that much image-expanding effort, as users complained, is required to make it legible. The map\u2019s complexity conveys the ordeal that those trying to master the Thought are facing.\n\nA slog, but it\u2019s the thought that counts\n\nTo help them, some big firms have set up Xi Thought \u201cstudy rooms\u201d. So too have libraries and community centres. In July Global Times, a tabloid owned by the People\u2019s Daily, crowed that the Thought was being \u201cstudied in all corners of society, from local governments to media outlets, from university students to street cleaners\u201d.\n\nOne purpose appears to be to enhance Mr Xi\u2019s stature as a leader comparable in power to Mao. Deng Theory is less often mentioned these days. Last month Mr Xi made his first publicised trip in six years to Guangdong, the southern province where many of Deng\u2019s reforms first took hold. During his tour Mr Xi did not even mention the architect of those reforms\u2014a striking omission given that next month China will mark the 40th anniversary of their launch.\n\nIn April Qian Xian, a party journal, said there had been continual debate over the meaning of \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d, the concept at the heart of Deng Theory. In an apparent dig at a weakness of the Theory, the article said \u201csome people\u201d thought the phrase was another way of saying \u201ccapitalism with Chinese characteristics\u201d. This, it said, had created \u201ctheoretical chaos\u201d. Mr Xi stresses that socialism with Chinese characteristics is in fact about \u201csocialism and not any other kind of \u2013ism\u201d (point two, subsection three on the mind-map).\n\nDeep understanding is not required. The party has a long history of requiring people to mouth leaders\u2019 slogans as a way of showing loyalty. Research on Xi Thought is mostly banal. Kevin Carrico of Macquarie University in Australia studied the Thought through a distance-learning course run by Tsinghua, one of China\u2019s best universities. He wrote in Foreign Policy that the video lectures repeated platitudes that would be \u201cfamiliar to anyone who has spent time in Beijing in the last 40 years\u201d. They offered, he said, \u201can unprecedented opportunity to observe the poverty of China\u2019s state-enforced ideology\u201d.\n\nXi Thought is formally described as a summary of the \u201ccollective wisdom\u201d of the party, and to some degree it is. In addition to borrowing from his predecessors, it is likely that Mr Xi relied heavily on the work of Wang Huning, a former academic who has played an important behind-the-scenes role in devising party-think since early this century, including Mr Xi\u2019s notion of a \u201cChinese dream\u201d (number three on the mind-map, with numerous subordinate points). Last year Mr Wang joined the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, the pinnacle of party power.\n\nYet promoting Mr Xi as China\u2019s thinker-in-chief could put him at risk. The more he is linked to China\u2019s \u201cnew era\u201d the harder it will be for him to deflect criticism for anything that goes wrong. A speech late last month by Deng Pufang, one of Deng\u2019s sons, gave a hint of dissent within the elite. In it Mr Deng appeared to criticise Mr Xi\u2019s assertive foreign policy. China, he said, should \u201ckeep a sober mind and know our own place\u201d. That idea is not on the map.\n\nFor a high-resolution image of this map, see economist.com/xismind", "E NGLISH UNIVERSITIES have long been defined by their architecture, from the dreaming spires of Oxford, to the red-brick universities built after the Industrial Revolution, to the concrete polytechnics that sprouted everywhere after the 1960s. Those who visit a campus today are likely to see another big round of building in progress. This time glass and steel are the main media, sometimes accompanied by cladding in garish colours.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rush to build reflects a battle to attract students, which is putting a growing strain on universities\u2019 finances. Universities receive twice as much money per student as they did two decades ago. But an increase in spending means that they are nonetheless racking up debt. Britain\u2019s 130-odd universities owe nearly \u00a312bn ($16bn), up from around than \u00a35bn in 2012, according to estimates collated by Reuters. In 2016-17, the most recent year for which data are available, 19 universities ran deficits, compared with six the year before. A few are said to be near bankruptcy. Some in better health are considering whether they would take over a neighbour if the option arose.\n\nThe competition for students is the intended consequence of a series of reforms introduced by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition in 2010-15, which aimed to get more people into higher education while pushing universities to pay more attention to teaching. The headline reform was to nearly triple the fees that universities were allowed to charge students, to \u00a39,000 a year. One reason for lifting the cap was to provide income for universities to borrow against. David Willetts, the universities minister at the time, has written that \u201cfinanciers always used to advise us that university balance sheets were very conservative.\u201d\n\nA less noticed but more important change was to remove limits on the number of students that universities could admit. Since they now rely on students\u2019 fees for much of their income, universities are keen to attract them. And since there are no longer restrictions on admissions, the most attractive universities can suck students away from the rest. This explains why borrowing has mostly been spent on sprucing up campuses. On an open day, \u201chow do you judge whether a university is good or bad?\u201d asks one university official. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge course content, so you use lecture halls or sports facilities as proxies.\u201d\n\nSince the financial crisis, bank lending has dried up. So universities have turned to capital markets. The universities of Leeds, Liverpool, Cardiff, Manchester, Cambridge and Oxford have all taken advantage of low interest rates by issuing public bonds, raising \u00a3250m-750m each. Less prestigious universities have looked to private investors, such as insurers and pension funds, in deals with shorter maturities.\n\nThe lowest-ranked universities struggle to find any lenders. It is also they who are running the biggest deficits (see table). Some institutions acknowledge that conditions are difficult: higher education \u201chas become market-driven and increasingly competitive,\u201d says the University of Bradford. Others point to particular circumstances. St Mary\u2019s University, for instance, says its deficit \u201cwas planned and focused on investment in areas of growth and student experience.\u201d\n\nThe squeeze is about to tighten. An unexplained fall in the birth rate at the turn of the millennium means that between 2017 and 2020 the number of 18- to 20-year-olds will drop by 150,000, meaning fewer potential customers. The government\u2019s efforts to cut migration will make it hard to recruit students from overseas to make up the shortfall. A forthcoming review of higher-education funding may recommend reducing tuition fees. On top of this, universities expect to have to increase their contributions to pension schemes. Some will \u201creach a point where it is difficult to make more efficiency savings,\u201d says Steven West, vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England. \u201cA shock is about to hit.\u201d\n\nMost universities will ride it out. Jason Rothenberg of MetLife Investment Management, an institutional asset manager, says one attraction of lending to English universities is good government oversight from a new regulator, the Office for Students (OFS). It ought to be aware of any difficulties before they emerge, since it checks on the finances of all institutions that register with it. University boards are also meant to monitor the finances of their institution. But some in the sector admit that small, undistinguished universities may struggle to attract board members of sufficient calibre to do the job.\n\nThe assumption among some universities and lenders has been that if a university gets into trouble, the government will bail it out. On November 6th Sir Michael Barber, the chairman of the OFS , said it would not. \u201cThis kind of thinking, not unlike the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 idea among the banks, will lead to poor decision-making and a lack of financial discipline, is inconsistent with the principle of university autonomy and is not in students\u2019 longer-term interests,\u201d he cautioned. The regulator\u2019s aim will be to protect students, not the university, perhaps by moving them to another institution or by arranging a takeover of their existing one. Sam Gyimah, the universities minister, said this week that it was not the government\u2019s job \u201cto bail universities out when they make reckless financial decisions.\u201d", "W ITH LESS than five months before Brexit is due, debate over possible deals is hotting up. Revelations of lawbreaking by Leave campaigns in 2016 are now adding fuel to the fire. The focus is on Arron Banks, an ebullient insurer who dubs himself the \u201cbad boy of Brexit\u201d. Mr Banks, whose gift of \u00a38m ($12m) to Leave .EU, an unofficial Brexit campaign, was Britain\u2019s biggest-ever political donation, has been having a busy time with official watchdogs. He has been referred by the Electoral Commission to the police. His insurance firm, Eldon, and Leave .EU have been fined \u00a3135,000 by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office for misuse of personal data. And the Financial Conduct Authority is looking into Eldon\u2019s practices.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Banks denies any wrongdoing. He claims to be a victim of hardcore Remainers bent on overturning the Brexit vote. Yet the evidence is against him. The Electoral Commission declares baldly that it has reason to believe that the source of the \u00a38m was impermissible because it was foreign. Mr Banks says the money came from a British-based firm, Rock Services. But this small service group is owned by Rock Holdings, registered in the foreign jurisdiction of the Isle of Man. And the \u00a38m was recorded in the accounts of Rock Holdings, not Rock Services.\n\nThe Electoral Commission has called in the cops partly because it has few resources and no foreign jurisdiction. But it is also because its maximum fine is just \u00a320,000, a trivial amount for potentially criminal offences. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office also has few resources and insufficient powers to deal with what it calls a disturbing disregard for voters\u2019 personal privacy. Insurance clients and Brexit supporters were bombarded with messages pushing each other\u2019s interests. There are also claims that Eldon employees worked for Leave .EU. Yet Mr Banks\u2019s response to the fines imposed for misuse of data was to tweet \u201cso what?\u201d\n\nThis sorry tale raises concerns over electoral laws besides the perennial worry of regulators with too few powers. Social media and targeted campaigns have become newly significant in politics. The illicit harvesting of personal data during the Brexit campaign by the likes of Cambridge Analytica, a defunct data firm that the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office says it may yet prosecute, was huge and sophisticated. Many countries now fear foreign intrusion, especially from Russia. Interviewed on television, Mr Banks oddly denied that Russian money was involved even before being asked. He has a Russian wife and business interests and has admitted to extensive contacts with Russian officials during the referendum.\n\nRemainers are up in arms over what many claim was a stolen vote. But it is hard to assess the effects of careful selection of social-media targets for pro-Brexit propaganda. Vote Leave, not Leave .EU, was the officially designated campaign organisation. Although it too was fined for overspending, the two groups hated each other. The 52%-48% Leave victory in 2016 was narrow but clear-cut. And the government itself spent \u00a39m on a leaflet promoting Remain.\n\nThe Banks affair has strengthened those calling for a fresh vote on a Brexit deal. Ironically, Mr Banks himself now says it might have been better to back Remain. This week a Survation poll for Channel 4 found a 54%-46% majority agreeing. Brexit may not be done yet.", "F OR ONCE , the outcome that was predicted actually occurred. Democrats took the House of Representatives in America\u2019s mid-term elections on November 6th, and will provide some welcome oversight of the White House when members of the new Congress take their seats in January. Republicans held the Senate\u2014with a bigger majority, which will make presidential appointments easier to confirm. Both sides declared victory. A starkly divided country now has a divided government. Underpinning the results, though, is the deepening of a structural shift in American politics that will make the country harder to govern for the foreseeable future. Democrats represent a majority of America\u2019s voters, but Republicans dominate geographically.\n\nDemocrats won the popular vote for the House of Representatives by a comfortable margin. Their position as the party that enjoys most support among Americans, thanks to its strength in urban centres, was reinforced by a surge in support from the suburbs, where revulsion with President Donald Trump was evident. Meanwhile Republicans tightened their grip on less populous, more rural states, easily beating Democratic senators in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. In a country where one chamber of the legislature is based on population and the other on territory, this division is a recipe for gridlock, poor governance and, eventually, disenchantment with the political system itself.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breadth of the divide is striking. Ten years ago there were 17 states with one Republican senator and one Democratic one. From January 2019 there will be just seven. In federal elections hardly any candidates seem able to survive in opposition-party territory. Only six Democratic senators won their elections in states carried by Mr Trump in 2016. The picture is less stark for governors, but in statehouses the pattern reasserts itself. From January Minnesota will be the only state where one chamber is controlled by Democrats and the other by Republicans. The last time that was the case was back in 1914.\n\nThis equilibrium may be stable, but it is damaging for the country and for both parties. For the Republicans, the danger is a long-term one. For now, they hold the White House and have an increased majority in the Senate. But in a two-party system, a party that prevails while consistently failing to capture a majority of votes will one day find it is no longer seen as exercising power legitimately by a majority of voters. For the Democrats, the challenge is immediate. They may rail against a system that disadvantages them in structural ways, but cannot change that system until they can work out how to win within it. Running up vast vote shares in New York and California is all very well, but on its own will not deliver a governing majority.\n\nWhat is the way out of this impasse? The main onus is now on the Democrats. For their own good, not to mention the country\u2019s, they have to find ways to appeal in America\u2019s heartland.\n\nThat starts with exercising restraint. Yes, they should use their majority in the House to scrutinise a president who shows contempt for the norms that have constrained past presidents. They should look carefully at what has been going on in federal agencies, and investigate possible presidential abuses of power or misuse of the office for personal aggrandisement. But Democrats should resist the urge to use their majority in the House to take revenge, hounding the president in the way that Newt Gingrich and his Republican colleagues once hounded Bill Clinton. Prosecution should be left to prosecutors. It is not obvious, for instance, that there would be much to gain by investigating the circumstances of Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. There is certainly no ground to impeach him, as some Democrats want.\n\nA second Democratic priority should be to show that they have the ideas and capacity for governing that can appeal to a broader swathe of voters. One way to do so is to make a good-faith effort to work with the president and the Republicans. There are deals to be done on infrastructure and on drug prices. They also need to make immigration less toxic (see article).\n\nIn 2010, when Republicans won the House during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and proceeded to block everything Democrats wanted to do, the White House argued that it was unjust for half of one branch of the federal government to stand in the way of everything else. That was right then and it is right now. House Democrats should not declare, as Mitch McConnell once did, that they will oppose everything the president does. There should be no repeat of the hostage-taking that saw the Republican House flirt with a sovereign default during Mr Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nPlenty of Democrats will counsel against holding back, arguing that the scorched-earth strategy that the Republicans used when they had a majority in the House worked perfectly well for them. Why, they will ask, should Democrats be the party of compromise in the name of better government, when their opponents have so often refused to give an inch?\n\nFor two reasons. First, it might just yield results. Admittedly, Mr Trump\u2019s recent behaviour does not bode well. Accusing Democrats of facilitating the murder of policemen, as he did in the closing stages of the campaign, is not the best way to foster bipartisan spirits. Mr Trump could give up on the idea of signing any legislation in the next two years, preferring to rule by executive order, while ranting against the opposition.\n\nBut he may also surprise, proving more willing to deal with Democrats than other Republican presidents have been.

An exception is Hester Peirce, who in January became one of the five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), America\u2019s most important financial regulator. Since her appointment she has given a series of speeches with a polite tone and blunt message about the downsides of government intervention.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough she has yet to gain a large following, her words have not gone unremarked. Her \u201carrival at the SEC is genuinely exciting\u201d, writes Steven Lofchie, a securities lawyer who runs a popular (within the small world of regulation) blog. It is probably the first time the word has been used in connection with the SEC in years.\n\nMs Peirce is not partisan, criticising both the centralising trend under President Barack Obama and structural aspects of equity markets which date from Republican administrations. A common theme is the harms of over-regulation. She cites Nobuchika Mori, until recently Japan\u2019s top financial regulator, on the proliferation of international financial overseers. Surveying 140 projects by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisation of Securities Regulators, the Financial Stability Board and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, Mr Mori warned that \u201ctoo much medicine might make the patient sick\u201d.\n\nHer first speech, in March, concerned the impact of a rule drafted by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was set up in 2009. Its aim was to improve mutual funds\u2019 liquidity; in reality, she says, it has increased providers\u2019 costs and requires them to produce numbers that are useless, even misleading. She is similarly critical of the \u201cfiduciary\u201d rule, another Obama-era regulation intended to ensure that financial advisers act in their clients\u2019 interests. The reams of legalese required to produce an operable definition, she says, are \u201cwonderful for marketing purposes but potentially misleading for investors\u201d, and provide \u201ca false sense of reassurance\u201d.\n\nIn May she took issue with the Obama administration\u2019s conception of the SEC as primarily an enforcement agency. That encouraged it to bring as many cases as possible\u2014indeed to inflate their number by double-counting. The increasingly opaque structure of America\u2019s equity markets, with their stew of dark pools and bilateral trading platforms, has also drawn her attention. In another speech she noted \u201cthe strange role that the commission plays in directing\u2014and often determining\u201d this structure, and asked if it had \u201clost its way\u201d.\n\nIn September she took issue with the notion that governments should mandate representation of certain groups, such as women, on company boards. \u201cPolicymakers might be tempted to get this or that favoured group included,\u201d she said, thus introducing \u201cuncertainty and political influence into corporate operations\u201d. And in a talk to law students at the University of Michigan, she challenged them to include in their concept of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d helping companies in the \u201chunt for profit\u201d, which drives them to \u201cmeet people\u2019s needs using as few resources as possible\u201d.", "I N 2010 GOLDMAN SACHS created a \u201cbusiness standards\u201d committee to try to repair the reputational damage the financial crisis had done.

Since 2015 investigators in various countries, including America, Singapore, Switzerland and latterly Malaysia itself, have been trying to trace the money it raised and channelled through a maze of financial institutions and shell companies. According to the filing in New York, funds were misappropriated to buy paintings, luxury properties and jewellery (including a necklace costing $27m), and to pay for parties attended by musicians, actors and models, and even a movie, \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d (fittingly, about financial sleaze).\n\nGoldman\u2019s role was to underwrite three bond offerings together worth $6.5bn, from which it earned $600m. That juicy cut drew accolades from the firm\u2019s senior management, even as those who expressed doubts about why the client was willing to pay so much were overruled. According to the indictment, $2.7bn of the money raised went astray.\n\nAccording to the filings, Goldman\u2019s former chairman for South-East Asia, Tim Leissner, has pleaded guilty to bribery and money-laundering. He is due to be sentenced in December, though that may be delayed. One of his associates at Goldman, Roger Ng, was indicted on similar charges and arrested on an American warrant in Malaysia shortly before the documents were filed. Also indicted was Jho Low, a Malaysian who allegedly masterminded the plot. Goldman has beefed up its legal team, hiring a former deputy US attorney-general, as it seeks to persuade prosecutors not to bring criminal charges against the firm.\n\nThe indictment acknowledges that Goldman\u2019s compliance department had blocked Mr Low from doing direct business with it and that its controls were \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d circumvented. But it also says that the firm\u2019s \u201cbusiness culture\u201d, particularly in South-East Asia, was \u201chighly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritising this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions\u201d.\n\nSome of the diverted money was allegedly used to support Mr Najib\u2019s re-election in 2013. Until this year\u2019s election, which he lost, the Malaysian authorities continued to insist that there was nothing to investigate\u2014even as America\u2019s justice department sought to recover what it regarded as ill-gotten gains. But the new administration, which campaigned against kleptokrasi, is bent on prosecutions. Malaysian regulators are working with American investigators to locate and recover assets.\n\nMr Najib, who faces more than 30 charges, including of money-laundering and abuse of power, will go on trial next year. In the weeks after he lost power, boxes stuffed with designer handbags, jewellery and cash were recovered from his residences. The publisher of the Edge, a newspaper which gave 1MDB heavy coverage, was arrested under Mr Najib. He has now been knighted.

Humans are wiping out species at a frightening rate, whether hunting them into history or, far more threateningly, damaging the habitats on which they depend. But occasionally, the destruction is warranted. Smallpox was officially eradicated in 1980, and no one laments the fate of the virus that caused it; campaigns to save the virus that causes polio are thin on the ground. How, then, to think about a new technology that will make driving a species to extinction far easier?\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat technology is known as a gene drive, so called because it uses genetic engineering to drive certain traits through a population. Those characteristics need not be deleterious: they might include greater resilience to disease among crops or, perhaps, greater tolerance to warming waters on the part of corals. But if the desired trait were harmful, gene drives could in theory make a species extinct. And if the species in question were the three types of mosquito responsible for transmitting malaria, proponents reckon it could save close to half a million lives a year, many of them children. The same approach could be used against other vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, Zika and dengue fever. Gene drives also offer conservationists a potential weapon against invasive species such as foxes, mice, rabbits and rats, whose proliferation threatens native species in some parts of the world. (Humans are unsuited to gene drives, which work best in species that reproduce quickly, with many offspring.)\n\nNormally genes have a 50:50 chance of being passed on during reproduction. Gene drives tilt the evolutionary scales. One area of research focuses on genes that can copy themselves to the second in a pair of chromosomes, ensuring that they will be inherited by all offspring. Biasing inheritance in this way is what makes it possible to push a desired mutation, whether harmful or beneficial, through a population\u2014controlling its level, and potentially wiping it out altogether (see article).\n\nLike many technologies, however, gene drives may lead to bad outcomes as well as good. Opponents think the technology is simply too dangerous to contemplate using. Some worry about playing God\u2014though discarding an opportunity to save millions of lives in order to defend a principle is itself unethical. Others warn that the technology could entrench the power of big agritech firms. But that is an argument for ensuring competition, not for ending research.\n\nThree other concerns are less easily handled. One is practical: removing a species from the food chain could have unintended consequences, particularly if gene drives can move to a closely related species. Another relates to governance. Genetically modified crops can be kept relatively contained; animals carrying gene drives could be mobile and respect no borders. One country\u2019s decision to use gene drives will have consequences for its neighbours. A third worry concerns nefarious uses of the technology, and not only by states. A mosquito, engineered to inject toxins, could be used as a weapon.\n\nFaced with such risks, some want simply to call a halt. An attempt to impose a moratorium on gene drives was rejected by governments in 2016 at a United Nations meeting on biodiversity. Another such meeting, which takes place this month, will debate proposals that could hinder field trials. But putting the brakes on research may impose real costs: not just the annual toll taken by malaria and other killers before an answer is found, but also slower progress towards making gene drives safer. Since the decision in 2016 researchers have made advances on drives that die out over time, for example. That sort of approach could go some way to solving the practical concerns. Given that it will be eight years or so before a gene drive is expected to be ready for field trials, more can be done in the interim to minimise its potential to cause harm.\n\nThat will require a more robust approach to governance, too. The ideal would be a set of norms for states and funders to adhere to. These might include rules on the mandatory registration of gene-drive trials; on stringent sequencing of gene-drive tests, as they progress from laboratory environments to field trials; on ways for neighbouring states to monitor standards in any country that wanted to use gene drives; and on agreed criteria for the approval of any release, such as the existence of an unmodified population in captivity.\n\nRules or not, rogue states and other malevolent actors may still want to use gene drives for malicious purposes. And, like many new technologies, gene drives do not require big organisations in order to be made to work. Prudent countries ought to plan accordingly. America\u2019s government, rightly, justifies some of its gene-drive research as a way to develop better defences against harmful uses. In the future, improved gene-sequencing technologies should make it easier to spot species carrying malevolent drives.\n\nThese risks underline why gene drives must be managed carefully. They ought not, however, to obscure the prize on offer if the technology can be made to work well. Humans are already radically and heedlessly reshaping the planet. Gene drives would further enhance humanity\u2019s ability to shape nature\u2014but with the potential to do so precisely, efficiently and for the better.", "B RITAIN IS AT peace and unemployment is down. Good news for most, but not for its armed forces. They are struggling to attract recruits, owing to fierce competition for workers and a lack of exciting overseas action. Mid-career squaddies are leaving, lured by juicier wages and better prospects for promotion in the private sector, particularly for those with skills in areas like cyber-security or engineering. Salaries in the ranks start at just \u00a315,230 ($20,030). As a result, the forces are losing troops faster than they can replace them. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) fell 24% short of its recruitment target last year.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plug this gap, it is widening the pool from which it recruits. Last month all roles were opened to women, who were previously barred from positions involving close combat. This week the MOD said it would start accepting applications from citizens of all 53 countries of the Commonwealth. That decision waived a requirement imposed in 2013 that such recruits must have lived in Britain for five years before they could join up. It is hoped that the Commonwealth will provide 1,350 new troops a year, equivalent to more than 10% of the number currently recruited.\n\nRecruiting foreign folk who have never lived within the country\u2019s borders is unusual, says Jack Watling of RUSI , a defence think-tank. Other European countries seeking to bolster their ranks are turning to conscription, which has been reintroduced in Sweden and Lithuania amid heightening tensions with Russia. Some countries recruit foreigners directly from overseas, but they are usually put in segregated units like France\u2019s Foreign Legion. In Britain they will join mainstream ones, with squaddies from Scunthorpe fighting alongside farmhands fresh from Fiji.\n\nThe idea may yet catch on elsewhere. Facing similar shortages, Germany is weighing up whether to offer citizenship in return for military service to people from elsewhere in the European Union. But it could also arouse post-colonial prickliness. Commonwealth governments may resent their citizens joining a foreign army, especially if they start seeing their best soldiers leave to seek better pay, says Paul Schulte, a former official at the MOD .\n\nWomen and foreigners alone are unlikely to fill the recruitment gap. Many specialist roles with shortages are already open to female troops. And once trained, foreign troops are no less likely to defect to the private sector than the current lot.\n\nThe branch facing the worst shortfall is the army. In 2012 it handed its recruitment operation to Capita, an outsourcing firm. By subcontracting tasks such as security vetting, the company has created a bureaucratic tangle, with some recruits waiting 18 months to get onto a training course. Many drop out. Capita insists that the worst kinks are being ironed out, but it is on course to meet just 50% of this year\u2019s quota. The firm will be responsible for recruiting most of the new Commonwealth troops, who will be harder to vet than locals.\n\nThe promise of action is the best recruiting sergeant, says Mr Schulte. Without war, soldiering involves a lot of sitting around in tents. Unless it is forced to spend blood overseas, the government may have to spend treasure on higher pay at home if it wants to keep the numbers up.", "A CALM USUALLY descends on America\u2019s farm belt in November. Combines have mostly finished churning across fields; trucks have hauled crops to grain elevators; and farmers retreat to their living rooms to rest. This year, at least by one measure, they should feel particularly content. Randy Sims, a hog-and-grain farmer in western Illinois, produced 75 bushels of soyabeans per acre, a third more than in the past. Indeed American soyabean production in 2018 is expected to reach 4.69bn bushels, a record. But it is unclear who will buy them.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s farmers are at the centre of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. More than a fifth of agricultural exports face new tariffs. From January to September pork exports to Mexico and China fell by 31% and 36%, respectively. Sales of soyabeans, America\u2019s biggest farm export, to China have plunged by 98% since January (see chart). \u201cIt\u2019s a big concern,\u201d says David Williams, who farms 3,800 acres in Michigan. He flew to Shanghai for a conference in early November with a group of soyabean growers keen to maintain ties with Chinese importers, in the hope that the trade standoff ends soon. In the meantime America\u2019s agriculture department expects farm incomes to drop by 13% this year. The ratio of farm debt to assets is forecast to rise to its highest level since 2009.\n\nIt is all reminiscent of the 1980s, when America suspended grain sales to the Soviet Union, interest rates rose, incomes sank and many farmers left the business. For now debt levels are climbing but still manageable. But much depends on how long tariffs persist. By the time the trade war ends, they may have caused enduring harm.\n\nAmerican farmers are titans of international commerce. From 2000 to 2017 the value of agricultural exports nearly tripled. Exports comprise more than a fifth of farm output. Grain gushes abroad in the highest volumes. As the world eats more meat, livestock producers need more animal feed, raising demand for soyabeans. Exports last year reached $21.6bn, more than double the value of corn, the next largest export.\n\nThese successes are due in part to government subsidies that incentivise production, such as farm payments that rise when commodity prices fall. These mainly support big operations: farms with incomes of $167,000 or more received nearly 70% of commodity payments in 2016, according to the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank.\n\nProductivity-boosting measures have helped, too. Mr Sims, for instance, now uses data on yields to fine-tune the application of fertiliser. He flies drones to inspect crops for insect damage. Farmers often coat seeds before planting to fend off rot and pests. Environmentalists worry about the impact on water and biodiversity. But production has boomed.\n\nThis has helped depress prices for corn and soyabeans in recent years, even as land, fertiliser and seed have remained relatively expensive. So a trade war is particularly ill-timed. Mr Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in March, and extended them to Mexico, Canada and Europe in May. In retaliation Mexico, the second-largest importer of American pork by value, raised tariffs to 20%. China\u2019s tariffs of up to 70% on pork, and 25% on soyabeans, hurt even more.\n\nMr Trump is due to meet Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, at the G20 summit later this month, but neither man may concede much. In September Mr Trump agreed on a new deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. But it does not affect America\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium, so Mexico\u2019s pork tariffs remain in place. Indeed Canadian and Mexican retaliatory tariffs wipe out the modest gain in exports from the new deal, according to analysis from Purdue University, leading to a $1.8bn net loss in farm exports.\n\nWhen one export market shuts, it can be hard to divert goods elsewhere. Pork, for instance, can be transported to Mexico in refrigerated trucks. It is more expensive to freeze and ship it across an ocean.\n\nSoyabean farmers fear that demand and trade flows will shift permanently. China\u2019s appetite for imports would wane if producers lower the soya protein in pig feed or if, as some traders fear, the government urges consumers to switch to chicken or beef, which require less soya than pork does. What demand remains may increasingly be met by Brazil and Argentina. Wallace Tyner of Purdue University estimates that Brazil has another 9m acres of farmland that it could convert to soyabeans relatively quickly. \u201cThe market loss that we face in the short run really opens the door to competitors,\u201d says Jim Sutter of the United States Soybean Export Council.\n\nThe price of American soyabeans is now depressed, compared with that of Brazilian beans. Many farmers must accept an even lower price than that published on the Chicago Board of Trade, as elevators struggle to store and transport grain for which there are few buyers. Mr Williams has had to sell his soyabeans at a discount. In North Dakota, which usually sends soyabeans to ships in the Pacific Northwest, some elevators have stopped buying them altogether.\n\nEconomists at the University of Illinois expect the average farm in central Illinois to make an overall loss of $70,000 next year. A recent survey from the Kansas City Federal Reserve found that farm lending from July to September was a third higher than in the same period last year. Most of the increase was not to buy new machinery but to support the basic business of farming. Farmers may plant more corn next year, rather than soyabeans, but that is not a permanent solution. Continuously planting corn, rather than rotating crops, lowers yields.\n\nIn 2015, 51% of output came from farms with sales of at least $1m, compared with 31% in 1991. The trade dispute may speed consolidation. Bigger farms have more cash to invest in yield-boosting technology and the scale to win better terms from buyers. Mr Sims is one of many large farmers to invest in bigger silos, in order to store crops while waiting for better prices.\n\nThe government may also become even more involved in agriculture, to muddled effect. Mr Trump, having disrupted global trade flows, is now using $12bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to offset some of farmers\u2019 losses. Concern for their welfare may buoy support for a new farm bill\u2014but the version favoured by Republicans in the House of Representatives would make even richer farmers eligible for payments. Mr Sims is hopeful that Mr Trump will win better trade terms for farmers. \u201cI am willing to weather the storm,\u201d he says. But by the time the president strikes a deal, whatever it is, American farming is likely to have become less competitive and more distorted.", "P UBLIC OPPROBRIUM ought to be something to avoid.

But it is not bad for everyone: for some populist politicians it can be fuel to their supporters\u2019 fire. And a new study* suggests that Wall Street\u2019s sins have a surprising side-effect: press reports of bad behaviour by investment banks during and after the financial crisis were good for business.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Roulet, of Cambridge University\u2019s Judge Business School, sifted all the editorial and opinion articles about the financial industry in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post published between 2006 and 2011. He built a list of 204 terms of reproach, signifying greed (eg, \u201cavarice\u201d), violence (\u201crapacity\u201d), extreme risk-taking (\u201cgambling\u201d) or opacity (\u201cmanipulation\u201d). He then searched the whole of those newspapers for uses of the words applying to 28 investment banks. During the period banks were roundly chastised, for example in reports by Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s attorney-general, in 2009, and by the Senate in 2011.\n\nMr Roulet found that the more disapproval a bank earned\u2014measured by the density of reproachful words in articles about it\u2014the more fees it earned too. Specifically, it was likelier to oversee initial public offerings of American companies\u2019 shares between 2007 and 2011. Of course, bigger banks attract more coverage; Mr Roulet controls for that, partly by using the density of critical words, not the total. And other factors also matter: the more shares a bank had placed in the past year, say, or the more \u201cbookrunners\u201d an IPO had, the better its chances of being hired.\n\nA finer analysis shows that adverse reports in the Journal gave a bank by far the biggest boost. What the media, and hence the public, found disreputable, Mr Roulet concludes, potential clients saw as evidence of professional prowess. Banks don\u2019t revel in being cast as villains.

They are characterised by an all-or-nothing, no-holds-barred aggression between two parties, the ruling Awami League and its main rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ). Disputes are most commonly settled not in parliamentary debate or at the ballot box, but through paralysing hartals\u2014strikes-cum-blockades enforced by partisan thugs. At the most recent election, in 2014, clashes claimed 18 lives on election day alone. More than 100 polling stations were set ablaze.\n\nThis week the Election Commission is expected to set a date for the next parliamentary vote, probably in late December. Things look calmer this time around. There have been no hartals; instead, the government has met with an alliance of opposition parties to discuss ways to improve the political climate. Even so, there is little hope the election will be fair (see article). The Awami League has spent its ten years in power systematically co-opting state institutions and hobbling the opposition. It has locked up hundreds of opposition activists, including Khaleda Zia, the leader of the BNP . Others have been executed, in the name of righting the wrongs of Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. Jamaat-e-Islami, a religious opposition party allied to the BNP , has been banned altogether.\n\nThe press has been cowed with a barrage of lawsuits. Critics of the government on social media are hounded. Unco-operative judges have landed in legal trouble. In 2011 the Awami League abolished the system whereby a neutral caretaker government presided over elections\u2014one of the causes of the furious protests at the subsequent ballot. The fact that the opposition has been relatively quiet in the run-up to the coming vote is not a reflection of greater harmony, but of the government\u2019s iron grip.\n\nPick your poison\n\nEven if the opposition were to have a chance in the vote, it would be unlikely to govern better than the Awami League. The army was so appalled by the corruption of the BNP \u2019s last stint in government, which ended in 2006, that it briefly seized power in an attempt to weed out crooked politicians before allowing an election to go ahead in 2008. (It tried to shunt aside both Mrs Zia and Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the current prime minister and leader of the Awami League\u2014to no avail.) In a leaked internal memo, an American diplomat described Tarique Rahman, Mrs Zia\u2019s son and now the BNP \u2019s acting leader, as \u201ca symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics\u201d who is \u201cnotorious for flagrantly and frequently demanding bribes\u201d. (His defenders say wayward hangers-on were responsible for misdeeds blamed on him.)\n\nThere is no easy way out of this mess. In an ideal world, Sheikh Hasina would call off politically motivated prosecutions, stop meddling in institutions that are supposed to be independent and reinstate the system of caretaker governments before elections\u2014things she shows no sign of doing. But there is scope for both sides to back away from their maximalist positions.", "M ORAL PANICS over new media are old hat. The social effects of novels, films, comic books and pop music were condemned by the grumpy reactionaries of the time. In recent years video games have been a popular villain. Exasperated parents and opportunistic politicians have long fretted that they make players lazy and listless, or else unpredictable and violent. Those concerns turned out to be largely misplaced. But new worries about the addictiveness of games, and the danger that poses to children in particular, have more substance to them and are already prompting a regulatory crackdown. The industry would be wise to get ahead of the problem.\n\nChina, the world\u2019s biggest video-game market, is leading the charge. The government clamped down on the approval of new games earlier this year, and stopped approvals altogether in October. Shares in Tencent, which built its business on video games and is one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, have fallen by 28% since the start of the year (see article). China is an authoritarian state prone to overreaction. But it is not the only country that is worried. Japan and South Korea, both liberal democracies, have passed laws designed to regulate a video-gaming industry whose products are increasingly seen as addictive and harmful. And as business models refined in Asia have come to the West, lawmakers in Europe and America are becoming more concerned, too.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch concerns feel more credible than prior panics, for two reasons. The first is that much gaming now happens online, and generates reams of behavioural data. This allows publishers to monitor exactly how customers are playing games, and fine-tune them to make them as compelling as possible.\n\nThe second is the realisation that players will happily pay real money for virtual goods. These can be upgrades, costumes or weapons for their in-game characters, or (more cynically) a lottery-style \u201cloot box\u201d whose contents are unknown in advance, but might prove valuable enough to resell to other players. Since the marginal cost of creating virtual items is zero, they are very profitable for developers. That has given rise to a \u201cfreemium\u201d business model, of which Tencent was a pioneer, whereby games are given away cheaply or free but players are constantly nagged to spend money on in-game items. All this has been supercharged by smartphones, which mean people can keep playing\u2014and paying\u2014at all hours of the day.\n\nThe result is an unhealthy loop. Firms strive to keep players hooked, because the more time they spend in a game, the more money they will spend on baubles within it. Whizzy data analytics let developers tweak their products to do just that, using psychological tricks and nudges familiar from social-networking sites and the gambling industry. All this can be extremely lucrative. Sensor Tower, an analysis firm, reckons that \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u201d, a popular game in the West, made $930m last year. The keenest gamers, known as \u201cwhales\u201d (a term coined by casinos to describe high-rolling customers), can spend thousands of dollars a year.\n\nTencent is trying to placate the Chinese government. It is expanding its age-verification scheme and limiting screen time for children. Its counterparts in other countries should take note. This newspaper does not generally believe governments should tell adults how to spend their money. But the industry could do more to protect children and addicts from its increasingly sophisticated products.\n\nIt is in its own long-term interests to do so. Video games now rival the film industry for clout. Gaming is thought to be worth around $140bn annually worldwide, and is growing at 13% a year. But society\u2019s attitude towards technology is hardening. In a world of fake news and hyper-targeted advertising, voters and politicians have awoken to the danger that devices and data may be manipulating people in harmful ways. A little voluntary forbearance now could save a lot of regulatory pain later.", "C ENTRE POINT , a tower that looms over central London, was empty for so long in the 1970s that it lent its name to a homelessness charity. Recently it was converted from offices to flats. Half are yet to find buyers. So the developer has taken them off the market pending a clearing of the political fog over Britain. Its boss complained to Estates Gazette, a trade paper, of bids that were \u201cdetached from reality\u201d. One-bedroom flats were on sale for \u00a31.8m ($2.4m).\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven flats with less hefty price tags have been hard to shift lately. Property prices in London are falling. Sellers are waiting for better prices. It is tempting to put all the blame on Brexit, but that would ignore the broader picture. House prices in big global cities increasingly move together. What happens in London has a growing influence on what happens in New York, Toronto and Sydney\u2014and vice versa. And trouble is brewing in some of these other markets, too.\n\nProperty used to be thought of as an inflation hedge. But in recent years it has become a substitute for low-yielding Treasury bonds\u2014a safe asset in which the globally mobile can store their wealth. After years of rapid price rises, houses in the most favoured markets are overvalued. Rising bond yields, tighter mortgage credit and shifting politics are now combining to push prices down.\n\nThe value of homes in the posher parts of global cities move in sync because they have become a distinct asset class. Private-equity firms and investment trusts, not just individuals, own them. Prices in such cities are explained more by global factors, such as the yields on the safest government bonds, than by local conditions. This global influence is particularly marked in financial centres that are open to capital flows, such as London, New York, Toronto and Sydney. It has extended into smaller European cities, such as Amsterdam.\n\nDemand from emerging markets such as China and Russia has been growing. Buyers are willing to pay steeply to secure a safe place for their savings\u2014or a bolthole for themselves. Cristian Badarinza of the National University of Singapore and Tarun Ramadorai of Imperial College London have shown that political trouble in Russia, parts of Africa and the Middle East predicts a rise in the price of prime London property. The same sort of influence is also found in less ritzy neighbourhoods, says Mr Ramadorai. For instance, property prices in Hounslow and Southall, which have lots of settlers from South Asia, picked up in the early 2000s, a period of political tensions in India.\n\nForeign demand has spillovers. If an oligarch buys a house, it drives up the prices of smaller properties nearby. A paper by Dragana Cvijanovic of the University of North Carolina and Christophe Spaenjers of HEC Paris finds similar effects in Paris\u2019s property market. Foreign buyers, mostly from China, have been a force behind booms in the big cities of Australia and Canada.\n\nBut the tide has changed. Global cities look awfully dear. The rental yield on investment homes worldwide fell below 5% for the first time ever in 2016, according to MSCI IPD , a financial-information firm. House prices relative to incomes are well above their long-run average in Amsterdam, Auckland, London, Paris, Sydney and Toronto (see chart).\n\nAnd prices are falling in some of the dearer cities, in response to a variety of forces. The yield on Treasury bonds, the world\u2019s benchmark safe asset, is rising. A tightening of credit standards on mortgages in Australia and Canada has squeezed housing in cities there. Uncertainty about Brexit has made London a place of political risk rather than a refuge from it. Meanwhile, capital is moving less freely. Governments are charier of Russian money. China is shaking down its super-rich for taxes and is zealous in its policing of capital outflows.\n\nA corollary of stronger links between global cities is a kind of \u201cwaterbed\u201d effect. For instance, when taxes were levied on foreign homebuyers in Vancouver in 2016, the market cooled, but Toronto took off. There are buyers who will compare prices in, say, Mayfair in London and Park Avenue, New York. They look for value. But it is vanishingly scarce. The market is turning. Those who bought at the peak, or are hoping to sell, will slowly adjust to a new reality.", "T HE CENTENARY of the armistice on November 11th is a welcome reminder that historical memories can unite the country. It is an unfortunately rare one. These days history is more commonly used to divide and inflame. The right of the Conservative Party and the left of the Labour Party\u2014the ideologically ascendant factions in their respective worlds\u2014are wedded to sharply contrasting interpretations of British history, which focus on very different events and freight them with very different emotions. Let us call them the Waterloo and the Peterloo interpretations.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaterloo was one of Britain\u2019s greatest victories over the French. In 1815 the Duke of Wellington ended Napoleon\u2019s career for good and inaugurated a long period in which Britain could play Europe\u2019s leading powers off against each other, to make sure that no new Napoleons could emerge. Peterloo, in 1819, was one of the worst peacetime massacres in British history. Troops charged into 100,000 peaceful protesters, who had gathered to demand more political rights in St Peter\u2019s Field, near Manchester. Fifteen people were killed and hundreds injured.\n\nThe Labour left is obsessed with Peterloo. Jeremy Corbyn, the party\u2019s leader, highlighted the massacre in his speech to Labour\u2019s annual conference in September. The demonstrators were killed by \u201ctroops sent in by the Tories to suppress the struggle for democratic rights,\u201d he noted, adding that Labour\u2019s slogan, \u201cFor the many not the few\u201d, was coined by Percy Shelley in a poem commemorating the massacre. Mike Leigh, one of Britain\u2019s leading film directors, has recently released a film about the massacre called \u201cPeterloo\u201d. The two-and-a-half-hour epic is not up to the standards of \u201cLife is Sweet\u201d and \u201cTopsy-Turvy\u201d. But, partly because it is so caricatured, it provides a good view of the Corbynite historical imagination. The established rich guzzle food and drink, the new rich grind the poor with the help of dark Satanic mills and job-destroying machines, the poor try to improve their dismal lot through peaceful protest, and the establishment responds by crushing them. Maxine Peake, one of the leading actresses, has driven the film\u2019s message home by comparing Peterloo to the more recent disasters at Hillsborough stadium and Grenfell Tower.\n\nThe Peterloo interpretation sees British history as a story of ruthless exploitation and intermittent resistance. What few rights the workers enjoy, they have as the result of heroic struggles led by a vanguard of activists who must fight against both the ruling class, who try to suppress them, and class traitors, who don\u2019t understand the true meaning of history. Mr Corbyn is much happier talking about history than economics. His favourite historical figure is John Lilburne, a 17th-century Leveller who devoted his life to agitation. (\u201cIf the world was emptied of all but John Lilburne, Lilburne would quarrel with John and John with Lilburne,\u201d one contemporary said.) He is fond of Marxist historians like Christopher Hill, author of \u201cThe World Turned Upside Down\u201d, and E.P. Thompson, who wrote \u201cThe Making of the English Working Class\u201d.\n\nThe Waterloo interpretation of history is the opposite. It celebrates our island story rather than lamenting it (and frequently slips into calling that island England). This school reveres the role of great men, particularly great military commanders, rather than agonising about the labouring masses. It also focuses on constitutional innovations rather than economic struggles. For Waterlooists, England\u2019s unique achievement was to limit the power of the over-mighty state through constitutional reforms such as Magna Carta, the establishment of Parliament and the common law. These innovations made British history fundamentally different from continental history. Whereas the continent had absolutist rule, the Napoleonic code and endless internecine wars, Britain had peaceful constitutional evolution, protection of individual rights and a globalised economy.\n\nA striking number of the leading Brexiteers are either history graduates or history buffs. Sir William Cash, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Daniel Hannan all read history at Oxford. Mr Rees-Mogg has argued that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union is \u201cas worthy for celebration as victory at Waterloo or the Glorious Revolution\u201d, and defined Brexit as \u201ca victory of British liberty over Bonapartist autocracy, and for free nations over foreign tyranny\u201d. Mr Hannan has written a book called \u201cHow We Invented Freedom and Why It Matters\u201d. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is an omnivorous reader of history books who, in an earlier role as education secretary, tried to refocus the history syllabus on teaching facts about British history.\n\nThese polarised views leave a lot to be desired on the scholarly front. The Peterloo interpretation ignores the role of judicious reform. The British ruling class did terrible things but it was restrained compared with its continental counterparts. \u201cOnly in England do they call that a massacre,\u201d sneered one French diplomat. The Waterloo view downplays the role of imperialism and plunder in the making of Britain. (It also downplays the fact that Waterloo was \u201cthe nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\u201d, as Wellington put it, and would not have been won without the help of the Prussian army.) Both views ignore the importance of entrepreneurial innovation and free trade in raising living standards. The starvation that Mr Leigh decries in \u201cPeterloo\u201d was eventually alleviated by the repeal of the Corn Laws and the import of grain.\n\nCouldn\u2019t escape if they wanted to\n\nThe clash of historical visions will remain at the heart of politics for some time. During the Blair-Cameron years, when policymakers all accepted the virtues of market liberalisation and quarrelled about means rather than ends, economics had a good claim to be the queen of the sciences. Today the crown has been passed to history. Economics has lost much of its lustre since the financial crisis. History, by contrast, appeals to people\u2019s quest for meaning and identity in a world that too often deprives them of both.", "A MID THE stress and sadness of choosing an old-age home for her husband, it took Li Wangke, a retired academic, a while to realise why one facility was so good at reawakening his playful, chatty side. She had visited other homes that had fine food and lavish amenities, reflecting the affluence of the couple\u2019s southern Chinese home town, Guangzhou. But one newly opened home stood out for easing\u2014at least somewhat\u2014the symptoms of the disease ravaging his brain. Rather than pampering her 83-year-old husband, its staff assessed his rare neuro-degenerative illness, then with warmth and firmness pushed him to do as much for himself as possible. They cajoled him to talk, exercise and even play ping-pong. He seems a \u201cdifferent person\u201d, says Ms Li.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several visits she discovered that the home\u2019s methods had been imported from Japan, a former wartime foe that older Chinese are commonly thought to detest. Her husband, also a retired academic, moved in full-time in late October. \u201cIt\u2019s from here that I learned that Japan takes really good care of its elderly,\u201d she says.\n\nThe home is a joint venture between a Chinese state-owned investor and Medical Care Service ( MCS ), Japan\u2019s largest operator of dementia-care homes. MCS opened its first Chinese facility in Nantong, a city near Shanghai, in 2014. A third opened in the northern port of Tianjin last month. It has plans for more in Beijing, Xi\u2019an and even in Nanjing, the site of a Japanese wartime massacre, memories of which plague the relationship to this day.\n\nChina\u2019s needs are vast. Degenerative brain diseases are too often confused with mental illness. Sufferers are shut away in family homes with unskilled helpers, typically migrant women from the countryside. Some families share guilty tales of sending relatives to psychiatric wards, where they are strapped to beds and fed pills. More than 10m Chinese are estimated to have some form of dementia. \u201cThat is a big, almost frightening number,\u201d says Akira Wate, the general manager of MCS \u2019s home in Guangzhou.\n\nBy 2030 China is projected to have 23m dementia sufferers\u2014almost the population of Australia. During a visit to China last month by Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, the two governments named old-age care as an area for co-operation. China and Japan are trying to edge closer in these stormy, Trumpian times. One bond involves demographics. With almost one in nine citizens over 65, China is at the point on the ageing curve that Japan hit in 1987. It has a lot to learn from its Asian rival\u2019s experience.\n\nChinese old folk and Japanese care-home operators have discovered revealing things about each other. MCS was full of confidence when it opened its 106-bed home in Nantong. Half a year later, just six beds were filled. For Asian neighbours that revere the old, China and Japan turn out to differ\u2014a lot. Notably, China is an exceptionally low-trust society. But bonds of family duty are stronger than in Japan, say MCS \u2019s bosses, noting the frequency of visits and the solicitude of residents\u2019 children.\n\nIn orderly Japan, entering a home is straightforward, says Mr Wate. An older person shows signs of dementia, facilities are recommended, their child might visit one, admission follows. In China, suspicion is the starting-point, with the domestic news full of stories of fatal fires or bullying at nursing homes. Unprompted, Ms Li relates how her daughter, a banker, warned her against taking private firms\u2019 promises at face value.\n\nChinese customers worry constantly about being ripped off. When it entered China, MCS set its prices high and built single-bed rooms to Japanese standards, offering the privacy and calm that pensioners in Japan demand. But Chinese clients wanted company and the lively din known as renao, relates Grace Wang, MCS \u2019s boss in China. They questioned the emphasis on doing things for themselves, grumbling that, \u201cI paid money, so you have to do everything for me,\u201d Ms Wang says. Her firm changed its model, building shared rooms, lowering prices and offering day rates to demonstrate its methods. The home in Nantong is now profitable.\n\nHistorical distrust of Japan has not been a big problem. MCS neither boasts of nor hides its origins. As well as a Chinese scholar\u2019s study and mahjong tables, its home in Guangzhou has a Japanese roof garden with benches, stone lanterns and an artfully trained pine. A few residents refuse to speak to visiting Japanese executives, admits Mr Wate, who is of mixed Chinese and Japanese ancestry. Most are pragmatic, associating Japan with good service.\n\nFamily dynamics cause more headaches than nationalism. In Japan, generous government insurance covers most care-home costs, giving old folk much autonomy. In China many in need of care must either sell property or ask children for help. Average monthly fees at MCS \u2019s home in Guangzhou are 14,000 yuan ($2,224)\u2014more than a typical pension. That makes entering a home a collective decision by as many as four or five family members. The elderly also need convincing. Many want to preserve their savings to help the young. Because trying to stay at home is the norm, the average age of MCS \u2019s residents in China is 85, about a decade older than at its dementia-related facilities in Japan.\n\nThe best sort of technology transfer\n\nStill, China is quicker to embrace change than outsiders might suppose. Ms Li recalls the traditional line: \u201cRaise children to care for you when you get old.\u201d But her children have demanding jobs, and she hates asking them to take too much time off. Nor are hired helpers the solution. When her husband loses control of his bowels, no hired helper will clean him, she says matter-of-factly. Such helpers are \u201cvery impatient\u201d. The Chinese once believed that only bad children send their parents to care homes, she concedes. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that way anymore.\u201d\n\nRather few Chinese will ever be able to afford Japanese-style homes, it is true. That does not make their expertise irrelevant. If China\u2019s old enemy can raise the profile of kindly, attentive dementia care, that alone would be a historic, neighbourly act.", "S HORTLY AFTER 2am on November 11th 1918 a train came to a halt in a wood in Compi\u00e8gne, near Paris. A second train pulled up on a nearby track. After four years of fighting, delegates of the German government sought an armistice from Ferdinand Foch, the commander of the French forces. Rare photos of the scene, hazy as a memory, show engine smoke twisting between the twiggy trees, makeshift boardwalks across the leaf-strewn ground and clusters of soldiers by the rails. At 5.15am the Germans signed the peace in the light of brass lamps in a teak-lined dining car. At 11am the guns fell silent along the 400km (250 mile) front, their thunder replaced by the pealing of church bells.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis peace ended a collective nightmare of hitherto unrivalled intensity and volume. The first world war was not just a grand tragedy. For the 67m who fought, it was a sordid hellscape. Few of the 10m killed in combat died from a \u201cbullet, straight to the heart\u201d, as pro forma telegrams to relatives put it. Many more bled to death in no-man\u2019s land, their wails lingering for days like \u201cmoist fingers being dragged down an enormous windowpane\u201d, as a British lieutenant wrote of the Battle of the Somme. Traumatised survivors sometimes slept in open sewers, and begged for their mothers as superiors ordered them over the top.\n\nThey guarded what slivers of humanity and dignity they could. At Compi\u00e8gne today visitors can view silver rings from the trenches bearing initials (LV, MJ, SH or G) or four-leaf clovers; pipes with marks worn where teeth once clenched; a tube of insect-bite cream; letter-openers fashioned from shell casings, the names of yearned-for correspondents etched into their blades (\u201cMarguerite\u201d, \u201cMlle Rose-Marie\u201d). A certain stoic humour also played its part. \u201cI was hit. I looked round and saw that my leg had shot out and hit the fellow behind me (who got rather annoyed about [it])\u201d wrote Charlemagne\u2019s great-grandfather in his diary in 1915, just outside Ypres.\n\nThe memorial at Compi\u00e8gne focuses on the leaders, the \u201cswitchmen of history\u201d as Geert Mak, a Dutch historian, calls them. A replica carriage is the star artefact, name cards marking where the German and French delegates sat. Outside, a statue of Foch keeps vigil over the clearing. On November 10th Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will visit the site. As they enter the room where the carriage stands they will pass under a quote by Winston Churchill: \u201cThose who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it.\u201d\n\nPondering the exhibits, that apophthegm seems at once true and yet hopelessly hubristic. The first world war happened because a generation of Victorian leaders took for granted the stable order that had prevailed in most of Europe for decades. They should have read their history books. Yet the war was also a tale of forces beyond the power of any leader, however well-read; of nations and continents not as trains on history\u2019s railway lines, run by drivers and switchmen, but as rafts tossed about on history\u2019s ocean, dipping at most an occasional oar into the waves. Fate was the real grand homme of the \u201cGreat War\u201d. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 would not have happened had his driver not taken a wrong turning in Sarajevo. The German army\u2019s initial advance was halted at Nieuwpoort by a Belgian lock-keeper who flooded the surrounding marshlands. Political twists in Berlin, not crushing defeat on the battlefield, pushed Germany to sue for peace in 1918.\n\nThe raftsmen also lacked maps. Across the continent, the armistice was greeted with relief. Newspapers announced it with a retrospectively stomach-churning sense of finality. \u201cThe war is over\u201d cried Londoners as ceremonial gunfire broke the news. The nightmare seemed to have passed, but it had not. The armistice and the peace treaties that followed in 1919 and 1920 reshaped the maps of Europe and the Middle East, and imposed vengeance on the defeated, seeding future conflicts. Millions returned from the front angry, traumatised, wounded, resentful or all four. Gueules cass\u00e9es (broken faces) the French called them. One such, an Austrian-born lance-corporal, would take Germany to war again two decades later, and in 1940 would have the French sign their own surrender in the same railway carriage at Compi\u00e8gne.\n\nThe power of nightmares\n\nMemories are everywhere. Two plaques in Compi\u00e8gne\u2019s station list the 23 locals killed in the first world war and the 20 killed in the second. Engraved brass cobblestones glint from German streets marking the addresses where Holocaust victims once lived. Recollections live on in diaries or passed through families orally. The past summer\u2019s hot weather exposed shells and bullets in dried-up rivers. Other artefacts remain hidden: the original French version of the Treaty of Versailles went missing and probably rests, forgotten, in some German attic or cellar. \u201cEurope is a continent in which one can easily travel back and forth through time,\u201d writes Mr Mak. The EU , forged from the rubble of the two wars, knits the continent together in the spirit of lessons learned: peace, fraternity, unity in diversity. The pedagogical value of the past is to today\u2019s European establishment what the uninhibited pursuit of freedom is to the American one, a foundational story, an essence.\n\nLong may that learning continue. Yet modesty is also due, about forces greater than the wits and power of even historically aware societies are able to contain. National chauvinisms live on despite the Somme. Anti-Semitism lives on despite the Holocaust. Societies\u2019 capacity to imagine collapse and barbarism in visceral terms fades with time. All Europeans can do is be vigilant and humble before these forces, dip their oars into the waves of history when possible, hold tight to their humanity and be grateful that their continent\u2019s past and present are now broadly in harmony, the former educating and civilising the latter, for now at least. Like train lines running together in a wood.", "W HEN GERHARD SCHR\u00f6DER launched a series of German labour-market reforms in 2003, his country\u2019s unemployment rate stood at just under 10%. This was also the rate inherited by Emmanuel Macron, who signed his own labour-market reform into law in September 2017. The French president\u2019s version is more modest than the Schr\u00f6der package, not least because the bits already enacted touch only the labour code and not yet the unemployment-benefit and vocational-training systems. But Mr Macron\u2019s hopes to curb unemployment are no less ambitious. A year on, has the French reform had any effect?\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first glance, not much. The number of jobseekers edged up again slightly in the third quarter, by 0.5%, after a tiny rise in the second quarter, according to P\u00f4le Emploi, the unemployment agency. There has been a steep increase, of 8%, in the number of people out of work for between one and two years. France\u2019s overall unemployment rate in the second quarter stood at 9.1%, still well above the 7% he has promised to achieve by 2022.\n\nPart of this is unsurprising. Labour reforms obviously take time to feed through into durable job creation. It was not until 2008, five years after its reforms, that Germany\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 7%, and a further four years before it reached 5%, thanks in part to the creation of low-wage \u201cmini-jobs\u201d, which the French government does not seek to copy. \u201cFrance will not be a country of low-cost work,\u201d declared Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, the labour minister, last year.\n\nMoreover, the second element of Mr Macron\u2019s three-part labour reform\u2014a revamp of vocational-training schemes on which France spends \u20ac32bn ($37bn, or 1.4% of GDP ) a year\u2014has only just gone into effect. This is designed to improve results by handing choice to employees in the form of training credits they can choose how to spend. A further \u20ac15bn over five years is going into training for the unemployed. It will take much longer for such measures to improve skills and job prospects.\n\nThe third and final part\u2014a reform of social protection\u2014will be unveiled only next year. Whereas Mr Schr\u00f6der began with benefit reform, Mr Macron has left this until last. During his campaign, he promised to extend unemployment benefit to all (currently it depends on accumulated insurance rights), in order to adapt the French welfare state to a world in which work is less regular and people change jobs more often. Such ambitions may now be scaled back, because of their cost. Plans to clamp down on those who refuse job offers remain on the table.\n\nNonetheless there are some indications that French employers are starting to respond to the labour reforms. One seems to be an improvement in the quality of jobs created. For example, in the third quarter of 2018 the number of firms reporting an intention to hire on permanent (rather than temporary) contracts was 10% higher than a year earlier, according to Acoss, the social-security agency. Figures also show a rise in the overall share of those aged 15-64 employed on permanent contracts over the past three quarters and a recent drop in those on short-term contracts (see chart).\n\nAnother measure is how many cases for unfair dismissal end up in the labour courts. French courts have until recently been free to award damages without limit, and these varied wildly. Mr Macron\u2019s labour law capped such awards, thereby minimising the financial risk of lay-offs (and so of hiring) to firms. In 2017 the number of such cases going to court fell by 15% on the previous year. One director of a services firm, which employs 40 people in its call centre, says that he usually hires around five people each month, and used to put them all on short-term contracts. Now at least two of those will be permanent job offers. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have motivated employees, but in the past it was a risk,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I feel it\u2019s a gamble I can take.\u201d\n\nSuch trends are new, and yet to be confirmed. Much will depend on the economic outlook beyond France. But, says Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Euler Hermes, a French credit insurer, \u201cthe trajectory is right, and we should see results by 2020.\u201d Mr Macron has urged people to be patient. The trouble, of course, is that politicians who introduce reforms are often not those who benefit from them. Just as his last labour reforms came into force, in 2005, Mr Schr\u00f6der lost his job, to Angela Merkel.", "N ORWAY\u2019S COUNTRYSIDE teemed with European soldiers in the past two weeks. A Montenegrin platoon drilled within a Slovenian company, which was wrapped in a Spanish battalion, which in turn was inside an Italian brigade. All were part of NATO\u2019 s biggest exercise since the cold war (see article). Yet this is not quite what President Emmanuel Macron had in mind when he called for a \u201ctrue European army\u201d on November 6th. Striking a Gaullist pose, Mr Macron urged Europe to free itself from military dependence on America.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Macron did not say precisely what he meant. Even so, his loose talk of a Euro-army is confused, quixotic\u2014and reckless at a time of growing transatlantic uncertainty.\n\nEuropean federalists have long dreamed of defence integration, but they have had little to show for it beyond some joint equipment projects and anti-piracy operations. The most ambitious plan for a common army collapsed in the 1950s because of French opposition. Since then, however, France has pushed lesser schemes to develop autonomous European forces. These were mostly blocked by Britain, which feared splitting NATO (whose integrated military command France left in 1966 and then rejoined in 2009).\n\nEuropean defence has returned to the fore for three reasons: Brexit will remove its most dogged opponent within the European Union; Donald Trump has shaken European faith in the NATO alliance; and France and Germany have been desperate to find common cause. But European leaders cannot agree on its aims: should it be a symbol of ever-closer union, a roving gendarmerie to police the continent\u2019s periphery or, as Mr Macron implied this week, a force that could beat off the very biggest powers, such as Russia and China?\n\nGermany is keen on using EU defence schemes, like Permanent Structured Co-operation, a cluster of EU projects launched with fanfare last year, to bind big and small European countries closer together. Mr Macron, irked that this gives priority to politics over firepower, proposed a European Intervention Initiative: a smaller club of more ambitious powers, open to non- EU members, who would jointly plan future expeditionary campaigns. Germany saw this as an attempt to drag others into France\u2019s African wars, but grudgingly signed up anyway.\n\nFor all these plans, Europeans would struggle to wage even medium-sized wars without extensive help from America, as they discovered during their air campaign in Libya in 2011. Though their defence spending is growing, there are still large gaps in their arsenals. In Norway, Europeans flaunted their armoured vehicles, air-refuelling tankers and transport aircraft. But data collected by the German Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, shows that their stock of equipment in all these areas has been shrinking. The EU will be weaker still when Britain leaves.\n\nSo what if some fantasise about Euro-forces? If that pushes them to equip their armies properly, and stop duplicating capabilities, so much the better. The merging of Dutch, Romanian and Czech units into the German army is promising. The danger is that little new fighting strength will be created, giving America yet more reasons to feel exasperated with its allies. European leaders rebuked America for pulling out of the INF treaty, a cold-war nuclear pact, but until recently kept silent about Russia\u2019s brazen violation of the accord. Mr Macron was crass in talking of the need to \u201cprotect ourselves\u201d from America, in effect comparing Europe\u2019s awkward but indispensable ally to Russia and China.", "T HE FATE of the euro was always going to depend on Italy. With annual GDP of more than \u20ac1.6trn ($1.9trn), about 15% of euro-area output and debt of nearly \u20ac2.3trn, it poses a challenge to the single currency that Europe seems unable to manage but cannot avoid. Matters are now coming to a head, as Italy\u2019s new coalition government instigates a showdown over the European Union\u2019s fiscal rules. The disagreement might well become disastrous. But it is also an opportunity for the euro zone to begin building a better, more durable approach to fiscal policy.\n\nTrouble began earlier this year when the populist Five Star movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, formed a government with the right-wing Northern League, led by Matteo Salvini. Both promised budget goodies: Mr Salvini a hefty tax cut and Mr Di Maio a basic minimum income. Such largesse may test the deficit limit of 3% set by the EU \u2019s stability and growth pact. And it seems certain to break other fiscal rules set by the bloc: the government\u2019s initial budget plan is forecast to raise borrowing to 2.4% of GDP in 2019, above the 0.8% target to which Italy previously committed itself and enough to reverse recent, modest declines in its debt burden.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU did not take the news well. On November 5th other countries\u2019 finance ministers warned that failure to revise the budget would lead to an \u201cexcessive deficit procedure\u201d, and possible sanctions. But Italians are unbowed. Mr Di Maio, now deputy prime minister, argued in comments to the Financial Times that Italy\u2019s fiscal expansion will prove so successful that other European leaders will clamour to follow, citing, somewhat dubiously, faster growth in America after a budget-busting Republican tax cut.\n\nBoth sides have their points. Italians are frustrated. Real incomes in Italy have fallen since joining the euro area; inequality and poverty have risen. Economic growth briefly rose to almost 2% in mid-2017 but has since slipped back to close to zero. At 10.1%, the unemployment rate is well above the pre-crisis low of 5.8%. Economic weakness is re-emerging even as the European Central Bank reduces its stimulative asset purchases and prepares for eventual interest-rate rises. Recent indicators of service-sector and manufacturing activity suggest that the economy is at risk of falling back into contraction. A return to recession would prove disastrous for Italy\u2019s politics and its long-run budget position. And a bit more spending now would probably not spark a bond-market panic, since the government\u2019s debt has an average maturity of nearly seven years and most is held domestically. A little forbearance on the part of the EU might therefore enable a dangerous political moment to be defused at little economic cost.\n\nYet it is hard to fault the EU for its wariness. Italy\u2019s slow growth reflects serious structural problems. The European Commission estimates that the country\u2019s natural unemployment rate has risen from about 8% in 2007 to 10% now, suggesting that boosting employment is a matter more of reform than stimulus. The OECD estimates that Italy\u2019s output gap, the shortfall between an economy\u2019s actual and potential output, will have closed by next year. Potential output\u2014ie, what an economy can sustain without inflation accelerating\u2014is easy to underestimate. But some variables suggest that labour-market slack is disappearing. For example, after a long period of decline year-on-year wage growth roughly doubled over the summer, to 2%. Nor have Italians been deeply mired in austerity in recent years. Italy\u2019s structural budget deficit has nearly doubled since 2015. Its pensions remain among the euro area\u2019s most generous, a perversity given the disproportionate economic pain borne by young Italians over the past decade.\n\nTight budget rules were, moreover, the price of the extraordinary measures that saw the euro area through its crisis earlier this decade. A bail-out programme for Italy could well prove fatal to the currency bloc; a showdown might be worth provoking to keep Italy\u2019s debt manageable and the euro area viable. Each side has its reasons for fighting all the way.\n\nCiao time\n\nThere is a path through this impasse. The euro zone shares a monetary policy but lacks a correspondingly coherent fiscal approach. The Italian dispute offers a timely opportunity to address that. Across the euro area as a whole, fiscal policy is arguably too tight. The ratio of debt to GDP is a relatively modest 86.3% and falling fast, by three percentage points in the past year alone. In countries with big budget surpluses, such as Germany and the Netherlands, higher spending on growth-boosting investments would slow the shrinking of debt burdens, but not stop it altogether. Some of the resulting fiscal boost would spill over into Italy through increased tourism and consumption of its exports, boosting demand without straining the Italian public purse. In exchange, the EU could ask Italy to moderate its fiscal plans.\n\nThough it would be anathema to northern Europeans, a further sweetener, in the form of limited debt mutualisation, should also be considered. Italy\u2019s debt is an old problem. It reached 100% of GDP almost three decades ago; but the country has run a primary surplus every year for the past quarter-century, except for the two years immediately after the financial crisis. Taking a hard line with Italy today does nothing to discipline the governments of the 1980s but adds to the bitterness felt by young people, who have fared worst under the euro and must accept towering budget surpluses in perpetuity or face ejection from the single currency. A plan to swap some national bonds for Eurobonds backed by all euro-area governments might be pie-in-the-sky, politically. Yet that policy would acknowledge that euro-area countries share a fiscal fate, relieve young Italians of doing penance for their forebears\u2019 sins and make fiscal probity for Italy a less Sisyphean task\u2014and, perhaps, more politically tolerable.\n\nEuropean integration is meant to build a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The euro area could wield its combined fiscal capacity to deal with the Italian threat while building a sense of shared fiscal responsibility. Instead, Europe and Italy are heading towards confrontation. The euro zone\u2019s greatest weakness is not its spending, but its politics.", "IT DOES not seem much. The Italian budget for 2019 envisages a deficit of 2.4% of GDP. By comparison, the shortfall in Spain last year was 3.1%. And America\u2019s budget deficit in fiscal 2018 was 3.9%. Though the gap between revenue and spending that Italy plans is inside the euro-zone limit of 3%, it has sent the European Commission and the guardians of the single currency into paroxysms of disapproval. The commission said Italy\u2019s plans represent an \u201cunprecedented deviation\u201d from previously agreed targets. In a move that was itself unprecedented it rejected Italy\u2019s budget and demanded a revision. On November 6th the commission\u2019s vice-president, Valdis Dombrovskis, said it was considering imposing on Italy an \u201cexcessive deficit procedure\u201d, for steering countries back on to what Brussels considers the fiscal straight and narrow. Failure to heed such strictures can ultimately lead to fines running to several billions of euros. Why all this fuss?\n\nThe roots of the standoff can be traced back to elections in March, when the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) took a third of the vote and the hard-right Northern League overtook Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s party to become Italy\u2019s leading conservative force. The M5S\u2019s success was largely due to its promise of an income guarantee for Italy\u2019s poorest. That of the Northern League owed much to the hard line it took on migration, but also to pledges it made to revoke an increase in the pensionable age and to simplify and reduce income tax. The proposals of the two parties, which formed a coalition in June, may have been popular, but they are costly. Even in watered-down form, they account for much of the increased spending in the 2019 budget.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo things explain the virulence with which Brussels and the other euro-zone states have reacted. One is that the Italian deficit is three times bigger than pledged by the previous government. The other is a fear that it will add to the country\u2019s already huge public debt (of more than 130% of GDP), sparking a crisis in the euro zone far more serious than the one triggered by Greece in 2010. The leaders of the two parties in Italy\u2019s populist coalition, Luigi Di Maio of the M5S and the League\u2019s Matteo Salvini (pictured sitting either side of the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte), pooh-pooh such fears, arguing that their expansionary budget will boost growth and thus the size of the economy. (The deficit is expressed as a percentage of GDP, so can be reduced by increasing GDP as well as by cutting spending.) Their government has put correspondingly optimistic growth projections into the budget. But given Italy\u2019s track record of low growth since the turn of the century, and evidence to suggest the economy is yet again slowing down (third quarter growth was almost nil), others are sceptical.\n\nThe populist coalition has not set a date for introducing the income guarantee or the reduction in the pensionable age, so some room for compromise exists. But taking on Brussels is a vote-winner in increasingly Eurosceptical Italy. And, with the European elections looming in May, the M5S in particular is keen to bolster its support: since March, it has slowly but surely been overtaken in the polls by the League. A compromise is not impossible, but it will not be easy to achieve.", "I N 2010 GOLDMAN SACHS created a \u201cbusiness standards\u201d committee to try to repair the reputational damage the financial crisis had done.

Since 2015 investigators in various countries, including America, Singapore, Switzerland and latterly Malaysia itself, have been trying to trace the money it raised and channelled through a maze of financial institutions and shell companies. According to the filing in New York, funds were misappropriated to buy paintings, luxury properties and jewellery (including a necklace costing $27m), and to pay for parties attended by musicians, actors and models, and even a movie, \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d (fittingly, about financial sleaze).\n\nGoldman\u2019s role was to underwrite three bond offerings together worth $6.5bn, from which it earned $600m. That juicy cut drew accolades from the firm\u2019s senior management, even as those who expressed doubts about why the client was willing to pay so much were overruled. According to the indictment, $2.7bn of the money raised went astray.\n\nAccording to the filings, Goldman\u2019s former chairman for South-East Asia, Tim Leissner, has pleaded guilty to bribery and money-laundering. He is due to be sentenced in December, though that may be delayed. One of his associates at Goldman, Roger Ng, was indicted on similar charges and arrested on an American warrant in Malaysia shortly before the documents were filed. Also indicted was Jho Low, a Malaysian who allegedly masterminded the plot. Goldman has beefed up its legal team, hiring a former deputy US attorney-general, as it seeks to persuade prosecutors not to bring criminal charges against the firm.\n\nThe indictment acknowledges that Goldman\u2019s compliance department had blocked Mr Low from doing direct business with it and that its controls were \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d circumvented. But it also says that the firm\u2019s \u201cbusiness culture\u201d, particularly in South-East Asia, was \u201chighly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritising this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions\u201d.\n\nSome of the diverted money was allegedly used to support Mr Najib\u2019s re-election in 2013. Until this year\u2019s election, which he lost, the Malaysian authorities continued to insist that there was nothing to investigate\u2014even as America\u2019s justice department sought to recover what it regarded as ill-gotten gains. But the new administration, which campaigned against kleptokrasi, is bent on prosecutions. Malaysian regulators are working with American investigators to locate and recover assets.\n\nMr Najib, who faces more than 30 charges, including of money-laundering and abuse of power, will go on trial next year. In the weeks after he lost power, boxes stuffed with designer handbags, jewellery and cash were recovered from his residences.

On November 1st he announced that S\u00e9rgio Moro, the most prominent judge in the long-running corruption investigation known as Lava Jato (Car Wash), had agreed to serve as his justice and security minister. \u201cHis anti-corruption, anti-organised-crime agenda, as well as his respect for the constitution and the laws, will set our course,\u201d Mr Bolsonaro tweeted. But there is a snag in Mr Moro\u2019s appointment. It appears to confirm the claims of the left-wing Workers\u2019 Party ( PT ) that the judge\u2019s motive earlier this year for jailing its leader and putative presidential candidate, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was more political than judicial.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether or not that is true, Mr Moro\u2019s new job (which he will take up on January 1st) is only the most dramatic example of an increasingly activist judiciary playing a more political role in Latin America. In Peru on October 31st, Judge Richard Concepci\u00f3n sent Keiko Fujimori, the leader of the opposition, to jail for three years without charge while he investigates claims that she received $1m for her presidential campaign in 2011 from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company. Her supporters say the judge is in cahoots with the government.\n\nMany see such cases as an overdue clean-up of Latin American political life by newly emboldened judges and prosecutors. The powerful, be they politicians or businessmen, historically had little to fear from a biddable judiciary. Citizens now know much more about corruption and are much less tolerant of it. Anger at the PT and its attempt to game the political system through graft was a big factor in the unlikely victory of Mr Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain. Tarred in the minds of many Peruvians because her father ruled as an autocrat, Ms Fujimori has played a destructive role in the country\u2019s politics, organising the censure by congress of competent ministers.\n\nYet there are risks. Jos\u00e9 Domingo P\u00e9rez, the prosecutor in Ms Fujimori\u2019s case, claims that she headed a \u201ccriminal organisation\u201d within Popular Force ( FP ), her party, which \u201claundered\u201d the Odebrecht money by registering fake donations. If true, this was a breach of political financing rules. But was it a crime? There is no evidence that Ms Fujimori, who lost in 2011 and 2016, offered padded contracts to Odebrecht. Mr P\u00e9rez claimed that if free she might destroy evidence (though she had not done so previously).\n\nWhen Miguel Torres, an FP congressman, complained that \u201cthey have taken away [Ms Fujimori\u2019s] right to an impartial judge, due process and the presumption of innocence\u201d, he had a point. Happiest about all this will be Alejandro Toledo, a former Peruvian president, who is accused of taking $20m in bribes (which he denies). His lawyers have new arguments to resist his extradition from the United States.\n\nAs for Mr Moro, some of his judicial acts now look questionable. Lula was leading the opinion polls when he was jailed. The sentence\u2014of more than nine years for receiving a flat worth $600,000\u2014looked disproportionate. Days before the election, Mr Moro released plea-bargaining testimony from Antonio Palocci, a former PT minister, which incriminated the party. It now transpires that Mr Moro was already talking to Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s people. All this undermines trust.\n\nMr Moro said his appointment \u201cmeans consolidating the progress against crime and corruption of recent years and preventing risks of backsliding\u201d. That is possible. He may also restrain Mr Bolsonaro in his policy of egging on police to shoot criminals.\n\nBut Mr Moro had insisted that he would never enter politics. How his breaking of that pledge comes to be viewed depends not just on how successful he is in his new role, but also on whether judges and prosecutors pursue wrongdoers in parties allied with the government as vigorously as he did Lula.\n\nWhereas corruption remains largely unpunished in places like Mexico and Argentina, Brazil and Peru have gone furthest in investigating the sprawling Odebrecht scandal. There are some safeguards in both countries. Lula\u2019s conviction was upheld by an appeal court (which increased his sentence), and his case will reach the supreme court. Peru\u2019s constitutional tribunal this year freed Ollanta Humala, yet another former president, and his wife from what it said were \u201carbitrary detentions\u201d without charge by Mr Concepci\u00f3n.

He quelled a panic during the Maastricht negotiations when he found John Major\u2019s talking points lost among a stash of papers. He kept lines of communication open between 10 and 11 Downing Street during Tony Blair\u2019s premiership, holding secret powwows with Gordon Brown\u2019s team in a greasy-spoon caf\u00e9. He helped to form the Tory-Lib Dem coalition in 2010. It is Britain\u2019s ill fortune that cancer has deprived the country of his skills in the past year of Brexit talks.\n\nHis detractors accused him of crossing the line that divides administration from politics, particularly when he failed to produce sensitive letters on preparations for the Iraq war (\u201cSir Cover-Up\u201d, the Daily Mail dubbed him). Some thought his view of his job was summed up when he put on a blue tie when David Cameron became prime minister in 2010. Yet nobody impugned his neutrality. He worked equally ferociously for Tory and Labour prime ministers, implementing the government\u2019s agenda rather than insinuating one of his own.\n\nLord Heywood\u2019s adamantine commitment to getting things done was not always obvious at first. He was so quietly spoken that it was difficult to hear him, and so boyish-looking that it was possible to mistake him for an intern. He hovered rather than dominated. But he had a genius for making himself indispensable; one colleague likened him to a drug that people get addicted to quickly. The result was that he kept accumulating jobs, adding the roles of cabinet secretary (2012) and head of the civil service (2014) to his position as chief adviser to the prime minister.\n\nHe had a surprisingly raffish side. At Oxford he socialised with anarchists and punk rockers, rather than the Bullingdon set. He formed a radical discussion group called the Apostates.

In last month\u2019s budget the Conservative chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced that austerity was \u201ccoming to an end\u201d, in what amounted to a toned-down version of Labour\u2019s promise to open the spending taps. Meanwhile his opposite number, John McDonnell, surprised many in his party by saying that Labour would support the Tories\u2019 plan to give a tax break to the well-off, by raising the threshold at which the higher rate of income tax is levied. The Tories have previously stolen Labour ideas such as a cap on energy prices, while Labour has adopted a law-and-order policy that would fit snugly into the Conservatives\u2019 manifesto, with its call for more police and border guards.\n\nWhether parties benefit from aping their opponents depends on the policy area, argues Margit Tavits of Washington University in St Louis. She examined voters\u2019 behaviour in 23 countries over 40 years. On issues that are seen as pragmatic, such as the economy, voters are happy for a party to change its tune. But when it comes to so-called principled policies, including immigration, voters will punish a party that strays from its beliefs. This is the case even when the party is shifting towards the median voter\u2019s views. Both Labour and the Conservatives lost ground to the UK Independence Party when they mimicked its hard line on immigration, offering stiff rhetoric but few policy changes. This pattern repeated itself across Europe.\n\nBut what works on the pages of an academic journal is messier in real life, argues Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London. Deciding whether a policy area is pragmatic or principled is more art than science. The National Health Service, for example, bestrides both. And nabbing too many of an opponent\u2019s policies may annoy a party\u2019s core supporters, whatever the issues in question. Mr McDonnell faced grumbles from Labour MP s (including those usually well to the right of him) for supporting the Tories\u2019 tax break.

It has become a staple of British culture, celebrating the messy ambiguities of English with its complex riddles and wordplay. Agatha Christie was a fan. Crosswords were used to recruit codebreakers in the second world war. But some fear for the puzzle\u2019s survival. Newspapers, where most crosswords are printed, are in decline. And a younger audience is put off by the puzzle\u2019s impenetrable rules.\n\nYet technology is offering solutions to both of these brain-teasers. The crossword has transitioned remarkably well from paper to digital platforms, says David Parfitt, the Times\u2019s puzzles editor. His newspaper has introduced a \u201cquintagram\u201d, tailored to smartphones, which has no grid and just five clues, making it quicker to complete and easier to navigate on a morning commute.\n\nTechnology can also help the uninitiated, via \u201chint\u201d buttons and the option to check answers. (We ran a cryptic crossword in 2016\u2019s Christmas issue, with online explanations of the clues.) Cracking a cryptic puzzle requires awareness of various conventions. For example, the word \u201cregularly\u201d signals using every other letter of the word it accompanies: \u201cPart of foot, regularly stroked\u201d is toe.\n\nThough the best competitive crossworders are a greying lot, moving the crossword online gives newcomers a chance. And for the first time since 2008, the Times competition has a new champion.

With annual GDP of more than \u20ac1.6trn ($1.9trn), about 15% of euro-area output and debt of nearly \u20ac2.3trn, it poses a challenge to the single currency that Europe seems unable to manage but cannot avoid. Matters are now coming to a head, as Italy\u2019s new coalition government instigates a showdown over the European Union\u2019s fiscal rules. The disagreement might well become disastrous. But it is also an opportunity for the euro zone to begin building a better, more durable approach to fiscal policy.\n\nTrouble began earlier this year when the populist Five Star movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, formed a government with the right-wing Northern League, led by Matteo Salvini.

On November 5th other countries\u2019 finance ministers warned that failure to revise the budget would lead to an \u201cexcessive deficit procedure\u201d, and possible sanctions. But Italians are unbowed. Mr Di Maio, now deputy prime minister, argued in comments to the Financial Times that Italy\u2019s fiscal expansion will prove so successful that other European leaders will clamour to follow, citing, somewhat dubiously, faster growth in America after a budget-busting Republican tax cut.\n\nBoth sides have their points. Italians are frustrated. Real incomes in Italy have fallen since joining the euro area; inequality and poverty have risen. Economic growth briefly rose to almost 2% in mid-2017 but has since slipped back to close to zero. At 10.1%, the unemployment rate is well above the pre-crisis low of 5.8%. Economic weakness is re-emerging even as the European Central Bank reduces its stimulative asset purchases and prepares for eventual interest-rate rises. Recent indicators of service-sector and manufacturing activity suggest that the economy is at risk of falling back into contraction. A return to recession would prove disastrous for Italy\u2019s politics and its long-run budget position. And a bit more spending now would probably not spark a bond-market panic, since the government\u2019s debt has an average maturity of nearly seven years and most is held domestically. A little forbearance on the part of the EU might therefore enable a dangerous political moment to be defused at little economic cost.\n\nYet it is hard to fault the EU for its wariness. Italy\u2019s slow growth reflects serious structural problems. The European Commission estimates that the country\u2019s natural unemployment rate has risen from about 8% in 2007 to 10% now, suggesting that boosting employment is a matter more of reform than stimulus. The OECD estimates that Italy\u2019s output gap, the shortfall between an economy\u2019s actual and potential output, will have closed by next year. Potential output\u2014ie, what an economy can sustain without inflation accelerating\u2014is easy to underestimate. But some variables suggest that labour-market slack is disappearing. For example, after a long period of decline year-on-year wage growth roughly doubled over the summer, to 2%. Nor have Italians been deeply mired in austerity in recent years. Italy\u2019s structural budget deficit has nearly doubled since 2015. Its pensions remain among the euro area\u2019s most generous, a perversity given the disproportionate economic pain borne by young Italians over the past decade.\n\nTight budget rules were, moreover, the price of the extraordinary measures that saw the euro area through its crisis earlier this decade. A bail-out programme for Italy could well prove fatal to the currency bloc; a showdown might be worth provoking to keep Italy\u2019s debt manageable and the euro area viable. Each side has its reasons for fighting all the way.\n\nCiao time\n\nThere is a path through this impasse. The euro zone shares a monetary policy but lacks a correspondingly coherent fiscal approach. The Italian dispute offers a timely opportunity to address that. Across the euro area as a whole, fiscal policy is arguably too tight. The ratio of debt to GDP is a relatively modest 86.3% and falling fast, by three percentage points in the past year alone. In countries with big budget surpluses, such as Germany and the Netherlands, higher spending on growth-boosting investments would slow the shrinking of debt burdens, but not stop it altogether. Some of the resulting fiscal boost would spill over into Italy through increased tourism and consumption of its exports, boosting demand without straining the Italian public purse. In exchange, the EU could ask Italy to moderate its fiscal plans.\n\nThough it would be anathema to northern Europeans, a further sweetener, in the form of limited debt mutualisation, should also be considered. Italy\u2019s debt is an old problem. It reached 100% of GDP almost three decades ago; but the country has run a primary surplus every year for the past quarter-century, except for the two years immediately after the financial crisis. Taking a hard line with Italy today does nothing to discipline the governments of the 1980s but adds to the bitterness felt by young people, who have fared worst under the euro and must accept towering budget surpluses in perpetuity or face ejection from the single currency. A plan to swap some national bonds for Eurobonds backed by all euro-area governments might be pie-in-the-sky, politically. Yet that policy would acknowledge that euro-area countries share a fiscal fate, relieve young Italians of doing penance for their forebears\u2019 sins and make fiscal probity for Italy a less Sisyphean task\u2014and, perhaps, more politically tolerable.\n\nEuropean integration is meant to build a whole greater than the sum of its parts. The euro area could wield its combined fiscal capacity to deal with the Italian threat while building a sense of shared fiscal responsibility. Instead, Europe and Italy are heading towards confrontation. The euro zone\u2019s greatest weakness is not its spending, but its politics.", "C ENTRE POINT , a tower that looms over central London, was empty for so long in the 1970s that it lent its name to a homelessness charity. Recently it was converted from offices to flats. Half are yet to find buyers. So the developer has taken them off the market pending a clearing of the political fog over Britain. Its boss complained to Estates Gazette, a trade paper, of bids that were \u201cdetached from reality\u201d. One-bedroom flats were on sale for \u00a31.8m ($2.4m).\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven flats with less hefty price tags have been hard to shift lately. Property prices in London are falling. Sellers are waiting for better prices. It is tempting to put all the blame on Brexit, but that would ignore the broader picture. House prices in big global cities increasingly move together. What happens in London has a growing influence on what happens in New York, Toronto and Sydney\u2014and vice versa. And trouble is brewing in some of these other markets, too.\n\nProperty used to be thought of as an inflation hedge. But in recent years it has become a substitute for low-yielding Treasury bonds\u2014a safe asset in which the globally mobile can store their wealth. After years of rapid price rises, houses in the most favoured markets are overvalued. Rising bond yields, tighter mortgage credit and shifting politics are now combining to push prices down.\n\nThe value of homes in the posher parts of global cities move in sync because they have become a distinct asset class. Private-equity firms and investment trusts, not just individuals, own them. Prices in such cities are explained more by global factors, such as the yields on the safest government bonds, than by local conditions. This global influence is particularly marked in financial centres that are open to capital flows, such as London, New York, Toronto and Sydney. It has extended into smaller European cities, such as Amsterdam.\n\nDemand from emerging markets such as China and Russia has been growing. Buyers are willing to pay steeply to secure a safe place for their savings\u2014or a bolthole for themselves. Cristian Badarinza of the National University of Singapore and Tarun Ramadorai of Imperial College London have shown that political trouble in Russia, parts of Africa and the Middle East predicts a rise in the price of prime London property. The same sort of influence is also found in less ritzy neighbourhoods, says Mr Ramadorai. For instance, property prices in Hounslow and Southall, which have lots of settlers from South Asia, picked up in the early 2000s, a period of political tensions in India.\n\nForeign demand has spillovers. If an oligarch buys a house, it drives up the prices of smaller properties nearby. A paper by Dragana Cvijanovic of the University of North Carolina and Christophe Spaenjers of HEC Paris finds similar effects in Paris\u2019s property market. Foreign buyers, mostly from China, have been a force behind booms in the big cities of Australia and Canada.\n\nBut the tide has changed. Global cities look awfully dear. The rental yield on investment homes worldwide fell below 5% for the first time ever in 2016, according to MSCI IPD , a financial-information firm. House prices relative to incomes are well above their long-run average in Amsterdam, Auckland, London, Paris, Sydney and Toronto (see chart).\n\nAnd prices are falling in some of the dearer cities, in response to a variety of forces. The yield on Treasury bonds, the world\u2019s benchmark safe asset, is rising. A tightening of credit standards on mortgages in Australia and Canada has squeezed housing in cities there. Uncertainty about Brexit has made London a place of political risk rather than a refuge from it. Meanwhile, capital is moving less freely. Governments are charier of Russian money. China is shaking down its super-rich for taxes and is zealous in its policing of capital outflows.\n\nA corollary of stronger links between global cities is a kind of \u201cwaterbed\u201d effect. For instance, when taxes were levied on foreign homebuyers in Vancouver in 2016, the market cooled, but Toronto took off. There are buyers who will compare prices in, say, Mayfair in London and Park Avenue, New York. They look for value. But it is vanishingly scarce. The market is turning. Those who bought at the peak, or are hoping to sell, will slowly adjust to a new reality.", "I N A HOUSE in central Dakar three Chinese men stand behind a glass screen.

Clusters can be found in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Others have opened in Uganda, Ivory Coast and Congo.\n\nTheir spread underlines China\u2019s growing soft power in Africa. In 2000 when China held its first-ever Forum on China-Africa Co-operation, a summit held every three years, traditional remedies were on the agenda. Two years later it hosted a conference in Beijing to discuss the topic. Many of China\u2019s 48 Confucius Institutes in Africa teach courses in traditional medicine.\n\nMoreover, as many as 50,000 young Africans are studying in China, many on scholarships provided by the host government. Although only a small share are at medical school, many students return with a taste for acupuncture and herbs. Demand is also buoyed by China\u2019s large diaspora in Africa, which some reckon has grown to 1m people.\n\nOne practitioner, Mame Awa Diop, studied traditional medicine in China before the Confucius Institute in Dakar asked her to set up a clinic. Business started slowly, she says. But outside her room several people sit in an orderly queue. \u201cOh, they\u2019re coming,\u201d she says.", "P AUL MAKONDA seems a lot more like a flailing moral crusader than the regional commissioner of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\u2019s commercial capital. The 36-year-old has come up with a variety of schemes to catch the eye of his patron, President John Magufuli. One is clamping down on supposed vices such as smoking shisha and sleeping in past 8am. His latest pledge, to set up a homophobic \u201csurveillance squad\u201d to track down those guilty of homosexuality, which is illegal, is by far his nastiest.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has also alarmed the West. On November 5th, the EU recalled its ambassador, citing a deterioration in human rights and the rule of law. The rot began soon after Mr Magufuli was elected in 2015 and has recently worsened. Today Tanzania is on the descent from patchy democracy towards slapdash dictatorship.\n\nBarely a week passes without brazen displays of arbitrary power. On November 1st Mr Magufuli appeared at what was billed as a \u201cpublic debate\u201d on his record after three years in office. It was no such thing. The president sat on a stately chair in the audience at the University of Dar es Salaam while sycophantic academics praised his tenure. Conveniently for Mr Magufuli, an opposition MP , Zitto Kabwe Ruyagwa, was arrested the night before and charged with sedition, so could not attend.\n\nOther foes have met similar fates. Opposition members of parliament who refuse to accept bribes (the going rate is 60m shillings, or $26,200) to cross the aisle and join Chama Cha Mapinduzi ( CCM ), the ruling party, are arrested. According to a lawyer who has represented opponents of the regime, every opposition MP who has rejected a bung has a charge against them. Last year Tundu Lissu, an MP , was shot and injured outside his home. This makes people scared to hold the president to account.\n\nSo too does legislation that outlaws the dissemination of any \u201cstatistical information\u201d that may \u201cinvalidate, distort, or discredit official statistics\u201d. The change follows the publication of an annual survey into political attitudes by Twaweza, a local research group. In 2016 it found that 96% of Tanzanians approved of Mr Magufuli. In 2017 the share was 71%; in July it was 55%. That is a poor showing in a country where CCM has never lost an election. Aidan Eyakuze, the group\u2019s director, has yet to get back his passport, which was confiscated days after publication of the survey.\n\nAnother reason for the law concerns economic data. Tanzania\u2019s GDP grew on average by about 6.5% per year over the past decade. But under Mr Magufuli the private sector has been subject to relentless shakedowns by tax collectors. Several prominent businessmen have been arrested on trumped-up charges of money-laundering, which is ineligible for bail. Though the government insists the economy is still expanding at its former pace, other economic data, such as slowing credit growth and rising bad debts, suggest otherwise.", "\u201cW E ARE FREE from political interference,\u201d protests New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. A scandal in the National Party, the main opposition, suggests otherwise. Last month an embittered National MP , Jami-Lee Ross, accused the party\u2019s leader, Simon Bridges, of breaking campaign-finance laws. He claims Mr Bridges deliberately disguised a donation of NZ$100,000 ($67,000) orchestrated by a businessman with links to the Chinese government. In a phone conversation that Mr Ross taped of him and Mr Bridges discussing the donation, neither makes any explicit reference to concealment. Mr Bridges calls Mr Ross\u2019s allegations \u201cbaseless\u201d. But whether the law was broken or not, the saga has stoked concerns about Chinese meddling.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang Yikun, the man behind the donation, is a resident of New Zealand, but has held positions in several official Chinese organisations, according to Chen Weijian, a dissident journalist from China who also lives in New Zealand. Mr Ross\u2019s recording suggests the money was divided into smaller parcels, which meant it did not have to be declared. (Donations of less than NZ$15,000 can be kept anonymous, provided the benefactor lives in the country.) But on the call Mr Ross also presented the donation as an amalgam of smaller gifts from associates of Mr Zhang. Police are investigating whether the donation was properly disclosed. Mr Ross, meanwhile, has been expelled from his party. Whatever the outcome, the row suggests munificence can win influence. In the call, Mr Ross and Mr Bridges discuss whether the party should respond by adding a business associate of Mr Zhang\u2019s to the list of MP s appointed by the party under New Zealand\u2019s system of proportional representation.\n\nThis is not the first controversy surrounding Chinese interference. Last year it emerged that another conservative politician, Jian Yang, had worked for 15 years in Chinese military academies and been a member of the Communist Party before emigrating to New Zealand. He did not disclose this on his residency application, but denies being a spy and remains a member of parliament. China-born MP s belonging to the governing Labour Party and the right-wing ACT have also been linked to organisations peddling China\u2019s agenda.\n\nIt is impossible to work out how many donations come with Chinese strings attached, because so many are made anonymously. Simon Chapple of Victoria University of Wellington calculates that the National Party received handouts worth NZ$4.5m in 2017. Three-quarters came from unnamed sources. At a fundraising auction in 2016 for Labour\u2019s Phil Goff, now the mayor of Auckland, New Zealand\u2019s biggest city, an anonymous bidder in China paid NZ$150,000 for a book written and signed by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president.\n\nSeveral former politicians have taken jobs with Chinese firms. The Chinese government keeps tabs on Chinese students at local universities and has co-opted most Chinese-language media. Last year Anne-Marie Brady of the University of Canterbury alleged that a Chinese-owned dairy had been used to launch a scientific device that could help China develop long-range missiles. A report published recently by Canada\u2019s intelligence agency complains that New Zealand is a \u201csoft underbelly\u201d through which China might gain access to intelligence shared by America, Australia, Britain and Canada.\n\nIn Australia, similar scandals have prompted the passage of new laws aimed at crimping foreign influence. The Greens, part of New Zealand\u2019s ruling coalition, want to lower the threshold for anonymous donations to NZ$1,000 and outlaw gifts from foreigners. A petition calling for an inquiry on foreign influence has been lodged in parliament. Publicly, Ms Ardern maintains that New Zealand\u2019s laws are fine as they are. But her government does seem to be considering how to respond\u2014without jeopardising trade with China.", "A S DAWN BREAKS in Hanoi the botanical gardens start to fill up. Hundreds of old people come every morning to exercise before the tropical heat makes sport unbearable. Groups of fitness enthusiasts proliferate. Elderly ladies in floral silks do tai chi in a courtyard. In the shade of a tall tree, dozens of ballroom dancers sway to samba music. Others work up a sweat on an outdoor exercise-machine.

Vietnam has a median age of only 26. But it is greying fast. Over-60s make up 12% of the population, a share that is forecast to jump to 21% by 2040, one of the quickest increases in the world (see chart). That is partly because life expectancy has increased from 60 years in 1970 to 76 today, thanks to rising incomes. Growing prosperity has also helped bring down the fertility rate in the same period from about seven children per woman to less than two. In the 1980s the ruling Communist Party started to enforce a one-child policy. Though less strict than China\u2019s, it has hastened the decline.\n\nDemography is changing in similar ways in many Asian countries. But in Vietnam it is happening while the country is still poor. When the share of the population of working age climbed to its highest in South Korea and Japan, annual GDP per person (in real terms, adjusted for purchasing power) stood at $32,585 and $31,718 respectively. Even China managed to reach $9,526. In Vietnam, which hit the same peak in 2013, incomes averaged a mere $5,024. Indonesia and the Philippines are expected to reach the turning-point in the next few decades, with an income level several times higher than Vietnam\u2019s.\n\nThis shift brings headaches. First, will the government be able to support millions more Vietnamese in old age? Only the extremely poor and people over 80 (together around 30% of the elderly) get a state pension, which can be as little as a few dollars a week. The most recent survey of the old, in 2011, found that 90% of them had no savings worth the name. Debt was common. Supporting them will become ever more expensive. The IMF predicts that pension costs, at the present rate, could raise government spending as a share of GDP by eight percentage points by 2050. That is faster than in any of the other 12 Asian countries it examined.\n\nThe problem is worse in the countryside, where most old folk live. Previously the young cared for their parents in old age. Today they tend to abandon village life to seek their fortune in the city. Surveys suggest that the share of old people living alone is rising, especially in villages. Many work until they die. Around 40% of rural men are still toiling at 75, twice the rate of city-dwellers. In Britain that figure is 3%. Often they do gruelling manual jobs, such as rice farming or fishing.\n\nProviding health care for millions more old people is another worry. Alzheimer\u2019s, heart disease and age-related disability are growing. In the botanical garden Toau, a 78-year-old in a white sports T -shirt, says he is there on doctor\u2019s orders, before taking a pill for his bad heart and joining an exercise group. About a third of over-60s do not have health insurance, which is costly. Many provinces still have no proper geriatric departments in hospitals. Informal health-insurance groups have popped up to fill the gaps. For a fee, members get exercise classes and free check-ups. But few doctors are trained or equipped to treat more serious conditions.\n\nThe government is starting to implement policies to reduce the fiscal burden and improve the lot of the elderly. Last year it relaxed the one-child policy. In May it said it would increase the retirement age from 55 to 60 for men and 60 to 62 for women, and reform the pension scheme to provide wider coverage. Next year it plans to begin revamping the health-insurance and social-assistance systems.\n\nBut none of that will change the structure of the economy. Usually as countries climb the income ladder they shift from farming to more productive sectors, like services. By this yardstick, Vietnam is lagging behind its neighbours. When the working-age population peaked in 2013, agriculture accounted for 18% of the economy. At the same juncture in China, agriculture was just 10% of GDP . Worse, farmers\u2019 output tends to decline with age, unlike, say, that of managers. This over-reliance on agriculture partly explains why three-quarters of Vietnam\u2019s workers are in jobs where they become less productive as they get older. In Malaysia that is the case for only about half the labour force.\n\nBoosting productivity will be tricky. The government is still wedded to statism. State-owned enterprises dominate many industries. Most university students, meanwhile, waste at least a year learning Marxist and Leninist theory. Many countries in Asia are ageing fast. But growing old before it becomes rich makes Vietnam\u2019s problems all the greater.", "Seven Types of Atheism. By John Gray. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 176 pages; $25. Allen Lane; \u00a317.99.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE VER SINCE the Enlightenment, Christianity has been exposed to rigorous examination that has contributed to the decline of organised faith. Though Christian teaching is at the heart of the Western academic tradition, atheism has long been the new gospel for many intellectuals. Some authors have tried to subject it to the same scrutiny that religion has received. But, as polytheistic Romans found in the fourth century, challenging rampant orthodoxies can be tough.\n\nAlister McGrath\u2019s \u201cThe Twilight of Atheism\u201d and Nick Spencer\u2019s \u201cAtheists: The Origin of the Species\u201d are excellent critiques; but both writers are Christians, so they have been relatively easy for unbelievers to dismiss. It has taken a prophet seated firmly in an atheist pew to publicise the creed\u2019s contradictions more widely. That prophet is John Gray, a retired professor of philosophy at the London School of Economics. In several books published over 15 years, Mr Gray has reasserted his belief that there is no God, while also attacking the liberal humanism that has emerged in God\u2019s stead\u2014which, he thinks, is as flaky as the religion it has replaced.\n\nAt the centre of his argument, in books such as \u201cStraw Dogs\u201d and \u201cThe Silence of Animals\u201d, is the assertion that humans are no different from other creatures. Christianity\u2019s \u201ccardinal error\u201d is to say that they are. Yet dispensing with the teachings of monotheism leaves no coherent concept of humanity, nor of human dignity. Mr Gray uses this observation as a launch-pad to criticise \u201cNew Atheists\u201d such as Richard Dawkins, and to point out that most modern atheists do not follow their reasoning to its logical conclusion. They may have rejected monotheist beliefs, but they have not shaken off a monotheistic way of thinking, and \u201cregurgitate some secular version of Christian morality\u201d. Mr Gray has a much bleaker view of atheism\u2019s implications: \u201cA truly naturalistic view of the world leaves no room for secular hope.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cSeven Types of Atheism\u201d Mr Gray neatly recapitulates his arguments, combining them with a whistle-stop tour of modern unbelief from the Marquis de Sade through to Friedrich Nietzsche and Joseph Conrad. He gives Christianity its due, conceding that not all enlightenment began at the Enlightenment and pointing out the imperfections of that era\u2019s heroes\u2014the racism of Hume, Kant and Voltaire, for instance. Many of the saints of modern liberalism were not as secular as they might seem, he suggests. John Locke\u2019s liberalism is indebted to Christianity at every point; John Stuart Mill\u2019s insistence that morals did not depend on religion \u201cinvoked an idea of morality that was borrowed from Christianity\u201d. The new orthodoxy Mill founded was deeply rooted in Christianity, Mr Gray says: \u201cthe belief in improvement that is the unthinking faith of people who think they have no religion.\u201d\n\nHe is as exasperated with knee-jerk unbelief as he is with unthinking devotion, and has no time for several of the types of atheism he enumerates. All of them look to replace God with some form of secular humanism, science or politics. Their high priests tend to be just as blinkered as the ecclesiastics they abjure, Mr Gray complains: \u201cWhile atheists may call themselves freethinkers, for many today atheism is a closed system of thought.\u201d He decries a rising intolerance in academia, where free expression is jeopardised by \u201ca frenzy of righteousness\u201d that recalls the iconoclasm of Christianity when it came to power in Rome. \u201cIf monotheism gave birth to liberal values,\u201d he says of today\u2019s illiberal liberalism, \u201ca militant secular version of the faith may usher in their end.\u201d\n\nInstead, he is drawn to the more bracing denominations of the new church, such as those espoused by Spinoza and Schopenhauer, \u201catheisms that are happy to live with a godless world or an unnameable God\u201d. These varieties reject the idea of a creator and dispense with all pieties regarding human nature. They have truly emerged from the shadow of Christianity: \u201cNot looking for cosmic meaning, they were content with the world as they found it.\u201d\n\nMr Gray\u2019s provocative, frank approach has three main drawbacks. The first is that the God he says does not exist cannot be recognised as the Christian God. He suggests that it was the apostle Paul and Augustine of Hippo who invented Christianity, turning a local Jewish movement into a universal one that Jesus never intended, and turning Jesus himself from a prophet into \u201cGod on earth\u201d. Naturally this disregards the Bible\u2019s account of Christ\u2019s teaching about his identity and purpose. But it also contradicts recent scholarship that sees Paul less as a Roman who created a new faith than as a Jew who thought he was witnessing the long-expected fulfilment of Judaism. It is ironic that, having spent his career denouncing outmoded orthodoxies, Mr Gray rests his critique of Christianity on outdated perceptions.\n\nThe forsaken\n\nThe second weakness lies in his view that progress is an illusion: \u201cyou will find it hard\u201d, he contends, \u201cto detect any continuing strand of improvement\u201d in human society. You don\u2019t have to be Pangloss (or Steven Pinker) to demur; a glance at the history of medicine is ample evidence to the contrary. But the biggest problem is the void to which his skilful demolitions lead. What ought to be the basis for Western civilisation after the decline of religious faith? Mr Gray never proposes nihilism, hedonism or suicide, and seems (like Mr Dawkins) to believe that peace, prosperity, honesty and common decency are good things.\n\nHe ended \u201cStraw Dogs\u201d by asking, \u201cCan we not think of the aim of life as being simply to see?\u201d This might sound profound over port at high table, but may be less persuasive to people mired in abject poverty. It is not a premise on which to build a society. His new book is similarly lacking in constructive proposals.\n\nYet its reflections on the future are insightful. Looking beyond the squabbles over science and God, Mr Gray sees the challenges implicit in abandoning the metaphysical and moral order that Christianity once provided. Like Nietzsche, he says the West cannot ditch the faith and expect to retain congenial Christian ethics. It will be difficult, he predicts, for modern liberalism to ground a universal moral law on non-theistic foundations.\n\nRelieved as they are by the weakening of the church\u2019s oppressive aspects, many secularists have missed the flipside of Christianity\u2019s decline. In the absence of a single moral code mandated by God, says Mr Gray, people must accept a spectrum of moralities, palatable or otherwise: \u201cAnyone who wants their morality secured by something beyond the fickle human world had better join an old-fashioned religion.\u201d", "E ACH MORNING , Maoua Kon\u00e9 (pictured) wakes beneath the black-eyed gaze of masks and marionettes on the walls of her cramped one-room flat in Bamako.

The custom co-existed with Islam, the main religion, which has historically forbidden figurative representation of human beings. Performances explore communities\u2019 histories, tell morality tales and limn the roles of men and women. They celebrate the coming of the rains and of the harvest. Masks and puppets stand in for people and animals, but also character traits, spirits and ancestors.\n\nThe country\u2019s rich cultural life has always been segregated by gender. In the renowned music scene, for example, women rarely play the djembe, a kind of drum, or the kora, a lute-like instrument. Women have traditionally been forbidden from operating marionettes, or even making them, a craft that entails complex rituals, conducted under cover of night and involving kola nuts and roosters. In these ceremonies, says Broulaye Camara, a fellow marionettist, male initiates determine whether a puppet\u2019s spirit will be benevolent. Women are barred, Mr Camara maintains, because they have not been initiated, and because they are gossips. \u201cWomen talk too much,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t keep secrets.\u201d\n\nMs Kon\u00e9, a tall 60-year-old with cropped greying hair, says the men have nothing to worry about. Her marionettes do not have spirits or powers because they are \u201cmodern\u201d, made of clay and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 rather than wood. She abjures the old-fashioned kind. \u201cI would never touch them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe marionette itself couldn\u2019t do anything, but the men around it could do very bad things.\u201d\n\nShe grew up in Koulikoro, about an hour from Bamako on the banks of the Niger river, a town known for its marionettes, masks and unique, sacred statuettes that represent the dead. She was born into a noble family in Mali\u2019s complex caste system, rather than an artistic one, and her parents did not support her ambitions. \u201cIt was difficult for my family to accept,\u201d she says. Of 12 siblings, she is the only artist, and the only daughter who chose not to have children, believing they would hamper her career.\n\nComing of age in the early decades of independence, she was a beneficiary of the investment in the arts made by Modibo Ke\u00efta, Mali\u2019s first president (from 1960-68). His government \u201cunderstood that the arts were a very important part of creating a national identity and bringing people together,\u201d says Mary Jo Arnoldi, a curator at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and an expert on marionette culture. Ms Kon\u00e9 was educated at the National Institute of the Arts ( INA ), a cutting-edge college that, says Ms Arnoldi, \u201cbroke down gender and caste boundaries\u201d and produced some of Mali\u2019s finest artists.\n\nMs Kon\u00e9 has broken many taboos herself. She made sculptures of torn vaginas to illustrate the harm of genital cutting, statues depicting domestic violence and satirical figurines of women wearing full veils\u2014a burgeoning practice in Mali, of which she disapproves. For all his scepticism, Mr Camara performed with her in the national marionette troupe in the 1990s, when urban companies educated Malians on subjects such as HIV and child labour.\n\nThis artistic progress has been violently interrupted. After a partial jihadist occupation in 2012, followed by a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, foreigners no longer attend Ms Kon\u00e9\u2019s performances and workshops. Invitations from European festivals and schools have dried up. Donors have diverted funds to the security services. (Around 14,000 UN peacekeepers remain in Mali; ethnic strife still bubbles.) \u201cEuropeans are frightened to invite us,\u201d Ms Kon\u00e9 says; and \u201cbecause there are explosions and people are being killed here, they won\u2019t come.\u201d\n\nFod\u00e9 Sidib\u00e9, director of Mali\u2019s annual marionette festival, thinks the current government and donors should sponsor the arts to promote peace in a divided country. \u201cThe political establishment don\u2019t understand the value of culture,\u201d Mr Sidib\u00e9 says. \u201cThe security problem will not be solved with arms, but with arts.\u201d", "Unsheltered.

A stalwart 19th-century scientist, she tramps the Pine Barrens of New Jersey in search of wax myrtle, swamp pinks and Venus flytraps. Her husband has left her for Victoria Woodhull, a suffragist who ran for president in 1872. Her intellect makes her the valued correspondent of Charles Darwin and his Harvard-based champion, Asa Gray.\n\nTreat plays a central role in Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s engrossing new novel \u201cUnsheltered\u201d, but she is no more an invention than are Woodhull, Darwin and Gray. She made her home in Vineland, New Jersey, a place that became a classic American manufacturing town but originated in the Utopian vision of a man called Charles Landis. He envisioned an agrarian community of homeowners whose lives would be untainted by the evils of alcohol. Half of \u201cUnsheltered\u201d is given over to Treat and her friendship with Thatcher Greenwood, a fictional teacher struggling to spread Darwin\u2019s new doctrine.\n\nTheir story alternates with that of Willa Knox and her family, who wash up in Vineland in 2016. When the university at which her husband taught went bankrupt, he and Willa lost not only a salary but their home. By lucky chance they inherit a house in Vineland from Willa\u2019s aunt; unfortunately, the place is a wreck. And in the novel\u2019s first chapter the joyous arrival of a grandchild turns to tragedy when the baby\u2019s mother commits suicide. The easeful middle age the couple imagined for themselves is upended. Meanwhile an unnamed, blustering candidate seems alarmingly likely to win the highest office in the land.\n\nMs Kingsolver knits these two narratives together masterfully. The final words of each chapter become the title for the next, a pattern expressed in the lives of the characters too. A Vineland house is crumbling in storylines nearly 150 years apart; relationships in both time-frames are unsettled by change; in-laws prove awkward. The novelist\u2019s stitching is never visible, only the beautiful cloth that results.\n\nWhat 1871 and 2016 have in common is a mood of revolutionary change. Willa becomes fascinated by Treat, her era and how frightening Darwin\u2019s work seemed to many: \u201cA great shift was dawning, with the human masters\u2019 place in the kingdom much reduced from its former glory.\u201d In the present, Willa and her family must learn to make new lives in a world of warming seas and melting ice. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to stop doing the shit that\u2019s screwing up the weather, and can\u2019t afford to pick up the pieces after we do our shit,\u201d she reflects.\n\nIf that sounds gloomy, \u201cUnsheltered\u201d never is. We got through this once before, Ms Kingsolver\u2019s echoes seem to say; we\u2019ll get through it again, somehow.", "Francis: A Life in Songs. By Ann Wroe. Jonathan Cape; 191 pages; \u00a316.99\n\nST FRANCIS was Il Poverello\u2014the little poor man. He was puny, wrote his first biographer Thomas di Celano, and his beard unkempt. In his youth he was the \u201cringleader\u201d of Assisi\u2019s vain and frivolous youth. He was a fighter, a wit in scarlet robes, a singer of troubadour ballads. After his call and conversion, he rent his flowing garments and wore a tunic patched with fox skin. He preached to the birds and they flew in the shape of a cross. He charmed the cricket that chirped (incessantly) outside his cell: \u201cSing, sister cicada, and give praise to your Lord.\u201d He signed a treaty with a wolf that had terrorised the people of Gubbio. The wolf nodded to each clause and shook a paw to sign. He talked of brother ass and sister sparrow and rescued worms from trampling on the road. He cooled his lust in snow and scoured his naked flesh with thorns. Where his blood fell roses bloomed. He bore the pain of Christ\u2019s stigmata, five wounds, in hands, and feet and side.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere have been many lives of St Francis,\u201d writes Ann Wroe in her introduction to \u201cFrancis: A Life in Songs\u201d. Ms Wroe\u2019s is a rare and beautiful telling. She takes the miracles of St Francis and sings them in four keys. First, she gives you the legend\u2014the call, the first churches, the followers, the sermon to the birds, the stigmata\u2014in St Francis\u2019s own words and in those of his early biographers, di Celano and Saint Bonaventure. Then, she offers two poems: one \u201can evocation of Francis\u201d in his own time, the other an echo of St Francis in the modern world. The fourth \u201cgrace-note\u201d\u2014enigmatic, epigrammatic\u2014links each four-part section to the next. The metre of the poems is (almost) always four-beat: the rhythm of troubadour songs and \u201ca conscious evocation of the fourfold sign of the Cross which, after his conversion, was the immovable centre and structure of his life\u201d.\n\nThis is a book stamped with a brilliant seal. Ms Wroe, Obituaries editor of The Economist and the author of allusive lives of Pontius Pilate, Shelley and Orpheus, holds St Francis up to the light and turns him this way and that to catch the gleam. When Stanley Spencer made St Francis modern, he painted him as lumpen and plod-a-day, wearing a Whiteleys dressing-gown, with ducks and chickens clucking round his slippers. Ms Wroe\u2019s St Francis is a more flickering presence, there in the sky and the sea, in unwanted pennies, in a mother plaiting her daughter\u2019s hair, in a watering can, a tin of HP beans.\n\nMs Wroe\u2019s recreation of the Sermon to the Birds is haunting. Unlike Spencer\u2019s scene or Giotto\u2019s in the Louvre, the birds do not flock at St Francis\u2019s feet:\n\n\u201cThey perched along\n\nthe gilded branches of a tree\n\nlike jeweller\u2019s stock\u2026\n\n...They did not stir. Perhaps each phrase\n\nslid off their smooth enamelled backs\n\nlike rain, like light. Yet on one limb\n\nset separately the wisest bird,\n\nwide-eyed and cowled, weighed every word.\u201d\n\nIn the modern telling, the birds become gulls wheeling above Brighton\u2019s Marine Parade, skirling, shrieking, shouting for bread crumbs:\n\n\u201ceach waiting for its turn\n\nto snatch a portion of allotted grace.\u201d\n\nMs Wroe can be witty and teasing. She takes a line from Celano\u2014\u201cJesus was always on his lips\u201d\u2014and imagines a young student toasting her Finals with beer cans:\n\n\u201cjust completely nailed\n\nthe Hegel paper; it\u2019s like, Oh my God,\n\nshe wrote six fucking sides! Jesus how good\n\nwas that?\u201d\n\nHer poems of the saint\u2019s struggles with his lusts and demons are written in an ecstasy of devotion. St Francis sleeps naked on the ground in a cave at Eremo di Montecasale:\n\n\u201cNothing between you now\n\nlying alone.\n\nNothing at all between\n\nYour flesh, her stone.\u201d\n\nThere is something here of the inspired vision of William Blake and the elegiac bathos of Philip Larkin at his \u201cChurch Going\u201d best. St Francis founded little churches and repaired old ones. He carried a broom to sweep the aisles. He, whose own weeping eyes gave him such trouble, would walk with joy the path to Ms Wroe\u2019s damp church in Lullington, East Sussex, where:\n\n\u201cLost spectacles left on the font\n\ncontinue to enquire for grace.\u201d\n\nLAURA FREEMAN*\n\n*Our policy is to identify the reviewer of any book by or about someone closely connected with The Economist.

On November 12th the leaders of Libya\u2019s warring factions will gather in Palermo, the capital of Sicily, for a two-day peace conference.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItaly has an interest in bringing order to its former colony. Libya is an important source of fossil fuels. Its Greenstream pipeline carries gas from western Libya to Sicily. Less welcome are the 647,000 migrants who are thought to have crossed the Mediterranean to Italy since 2014. Most set off from Libya. Their numbers have recently plummeted\u2014just 22,000 arrived in the first ten months of this year, an 80% drop from last year. But they still rile Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s de facto leader.\n\nMr Salvini will have his work cut out. The situation in Libya is bleak, with the country split between rival militias and UN -led peace talks bogged down. One of the dignitaries in Palermo will be Fayez al-Serraj, head of the UN -backed government. Despite his lofty title, in practice he is little more than the mayor of Tripoli, the capital, which he controls only with the help of allied militias. One of them, from the nearby town of Tarhouna, attacked Tripoli in August over an economic dispute. More than 100 people were killed before the UN negotiated a ceasefire.\n\nThings are little better in the east, ruled by a general-turned-warlord called Khalifa Haftar. Islamist militants still carry out car-bombings and assassinations, while General Haftar undermines state institutions in Tripoli. He controls the strip of coast near Sirte, where Libya\u2019s main oil terminals are located (see map). They are meant to be operated by the Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation. In June, however, the general\u2019s men seized them and announced that revenues would be sent to a rival oil corporation in the east. They withdrew only after America threatened to impose sanctions. In the south, meanwhile, ethnic Tuareg and Toubou militias are battling for control, and criminal gangs from neighbouring Chad prey on civilians.\n\nSo, to put it mildly, things in Libya are not conducive to a peace conference\u2014but Italy is more concerned with the situation in France. Both countries are jockeying for influence. Italy\u2019s interests lie in western Libya, where both the gas pipeline and the migrant boats enter the Mediterranean. It sees Mr Serraj as an ally and has reportedly paid western warlords to stop migrant boats from setting sail. France is happier to work with General Haftar, whom it sees as more likely to stabilise the country. The French army has deployed thousands of its troops to fight jihadists in five former colonies in the adjacent Sahel region.\n\nIn May France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, hosted the Libyan rivals for his own summit. They agreed to hold elections by December 10th. That deadline was always delusional\u2014even ignoring the violence, Libya lacks an electoral law. It also undermined the UN envoy, Ghassan Salam\u00e9, who wants Libyans to hold a national conference and draft a new constitution before holding elections.\n\nBoth Italy and France have commercial motives as well. Libyan oil is cheap to extract and easy to export to Europe. Eni and Total, the Italian and French energy giants, have long competed to produce it. Eni is the largest foreign producer in Libya, but Total is starting to catch up. In March it acquired a 16% stake in the Waha concession in the Sirte basin. If the deal goes through, it could produce 400,000 barrels per day in two or three years. Eni\u2019s CEO , Claudio Descalzi, says he welcomes the \u201chealthy\u201d competition. \u201c[Libya] benefits from this,\u201d he says. The Italian government is less sanguine. It resents French involvement in a country that it sees as in its sphere of influence. Italian politicians accuse Mr Macron of helping General Haftar for Total\u2019s sake.", "T UNISIA IS PERHAPS best known as the lone Arab-spring success story, a democracy in a region full of autocrats.

She is not alone. This year\u2019s Carthage Film Festival, which runs from November 3rd to November 10th in Tunis, features several Tunisian films that tackle radicalisation. In \u201cBrotherhood\u201d, a young Tunisian man returns from Syria to his parents\u2019 farm with a fully veiled Syrian wife. His mother is happy to see him, but his father is suspicious. After a few days he reports his son to the police (though he later regrets his decision).\n\nThe Tunisian government\u2019s policy is to arrest returning jihadists immediately. \u201cThere is no rehabilitation at all,\u201d says Messaoud Romdhani of the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, an NGO . More than 1,500 Tunisians have been jailed on terrorism charges, according to his group. \u201cPrison is a very good place to become more radicalised,\u201d he says.\n\nBut so is the neighbourhood. Another film, \u201cFatwa\u201d, follows a father\u2019s efforts to figure out how his recently deceased son fell in with radical Islamists. He discovers that the area of Tunis where his son lived has been transformed by Salafism, a puritanical version of Islam. The old imam, a devotee of Sufi mysticism, has been replaced by a more conservative preacher; the cinema has closed. \u201cIt\u2019s the type of conversation we\u2019ve been having in private for years,\u201d says Zakia Hamda, an activist and filmgoer from Tunis. \u201cOur traditional values were snatched away by fundamentalists. It was traumatic.\u201d\n\nOn October 29th a woman, who may have been radicalised online, blew herself up not far from cinemas taking part in the festival. That did not scare away audiences. At a screening of \u201cFatwa\u201d cheers rang out when the father pinned an extremist against the wall. \u201cWe work for Allah to promote virtue and eliminate vice,\u201d says the radical. \u201cGo get yourself a job and Allah will look after himself,\u201d says the father.", "A CALM USUALLY descends on America\u2019s farm belt in November. Combines have mostly finished churning across fields; trucks have hauled crops to grain elevators; and farmers retreat to their living rooms to rest. This year, at least by one measure, they should feel particularly content. Randy Sims, a hog-and-grain farmer in western Illinois, produced 75 bushels of soyabeans per acre, a third more than in the past. Indeed American soyabean production in 2018 is expected to reach 4.69bn bushels, a record. But it is unclear who will buy them.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica\u2019s farmers are at the centre of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. More than a fifth of agricultural exports face new tariffs. From January to September pork exports to Mexico and China fell by 31% and 36%, respectively. Sales of soyabeans, America\u2019s biggest farm export, to China have plunged by 98% since January (see chart). \u201cIt\u2019s a big concern,\u201d says David Williams, who farms 3,800 acres in Michigan. He flew to Shanghai for a conference in early November with a group of soyabean growers keen to maintain ties with Chinese importers, in the hope that the trade standoff ends soon. In the meantime America\u2019s agriculture department expects farm incomes to drop by 13% this year. The ratio of farm debt to assets is forecast to rise to its highest level since 2009.\n\nIt is all reminiscent of the 1980s, when America suspended grain sales to the Soviet Union, interest rates rose, incomes sank and many farmers left the business. For now debt levels are climbing but still manageable. But much depends on how long tariffs persist. By the time the trade war ends, they may have caused enduring harm.\n\nAmerican farmers are titans of international commerce. From 2000 to 2017 the value of agricultural exports nearly tripled. Exports comprise more than a fifth of farm output. Grain gushes abroad in the highest volumes. As the world eats more meat, livestock producers need more animal feed, raising demand for soyabeans. Exports last year reached $21.6bn, more than double the value of corn, the next largest export.\n\nThese successes are due in part to government subsidies that incentivise production, such as farm payments that rise when commodity prices fall. These mainly support big operations: farms with incomes of $167,000 or more received nearly 70% of commodity payments in 2016, according to the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank.\n\nProductivity-boosting measures have helped, too. Mr Sims, for instance, now uses data on yields to fine-tune the application of fertiliser. He flies drones to inspect crops for insect damage. Farmers often coat seeds before planting to fend off rot and pests. Environmentalists worry about the impact on water and biodiversity. But production has boomed.\n\nThis has helped depress prices for corn and soyabeans in recent years, even as land, fertiliser and seed have remained relatively expensive. So a trade war is particularly ill-timed. Mr Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in March, and extended them to Mexico, Canada and Europe in May. In retaliation Mexico, the second-largest importer of American pork by value, raised tariffs to 20%. China\u2019s tariffs of up to 70% on pork, and 25% on soyabeans, hurt even more.\n\nMr Trump is due to meet Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, at the G20 summit later this month, but neither man may concede much. In September Mr Trump agreed on a new deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. But it does not affect America\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium, so Mexico\u2019s pork tariffs remain in place. Indeed Canadian and Mexican retaliatory tariffs wipe out the modest gain in exports from the new deal, according to analysis from Purdue University, leading to a $1.8bn net loss in farm exports.\n\nWhen one export market shuts, it can be hard to divert goods elsewhere. Pork, for instance, can be transported to Mexico in refrigerated trucks. It is more expensive to freeze and ship it across an ocean.\n\nSoyabean farmers fear that demand and trade flows will shift permanently. China\u2019s appetite for imports would wane if producers lower the soya protein in pig feed or if, as some traders fear, the government urges consumers to switch to chicken or beef, which require less soya than pork does. What demand remains may increasingly be met by Brazil and Argentina. Wallace Tyner of Purdue University estimates that Brazil has another 9m acres of farmland that it could convert to soyabeans relatively quickly. \u201cThe market loss that we face in the short run really opens the door to competitors,\u201d says Jim Sutter of the United States Soybean Export Council.\n\nThe price of American soyabeans is now depressed, compared with that of Brazilian beans. Many farmers must accept an even lower price than that published on the Chicago Board of Trade, as elevators struggle to store and transport grain for which there are few buyers. Mr Williams has had to sell his soyabeans at a discount. In North Dakota, which usually sends soyabeans to ships in the Pacific Northwest, some elevators have stopped buying them altogether.\n\nEconomists at the University of Illinois expect the average farm in central Illinois to make an overall loss of $70,000 next year. A recent survey from the Kansas City Federal Reserve found that farm lending from July to September was a third higher than in the same period last year. Most of the increase was not to buy new machinery but to support the basic business of farming. Farmers may plant more corn next year, rather than soyabeans, but that is not a permanent solution. Continuously planting corn, rather than rotating crops, lowers yields.\n\nIn 2015, 51% of output came from farms with sales of at least $1m, compared with 31% in 1991. The trade dispute may speed consolidation. Bigger farms have more cash to invest in yield-boosting technology and the scale to win better terms from buyers. Mr Sims is one of many large farmers to invest in bigger silos, in order to store crops while waiting for better prices.\n\nThe government may also become even more involved in agriculture, to muddled effect. Mr Trump, having disrupted global trade flows, is now using $12bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to offset some of farmers\u2019 losses. Concern for their welfare may buoy support for a new farm bill\u2014but the version favoured by Republicans in the House of Representatives would make even richer farmers eligible for payments. Mr Sims is hopeful that Mr Trump will win better trade terms for farmers. \u201cI am willing to weather the storm,\u201d he says. But by the time the president strikes a deal, whatever it is, American farming is likely to have become less competitive and more distorted.", "C OMPANIES SUCH as Casper, which sells mattresses, Warby Parker, a spectacles brand, and Glossier, a cosmetics firm, were once seen as interesting curiosities. Touting their products online, luring customers with digital advertising and eschewing conventional retailers and marketers, they were anomalies shaking up small segments of retail. In fact, the growth of microbrands\u2014or direct-to-consumer ( DTC ) brands\u2014represents a profound shift in the consumer-goods sector.\n\nIndustry giants took time to begin worrying about the arrival of game-changing newcomers; barriers to entry in their business are high. But by now the incumbents are stagnating. According to Nielsen, a consultancy, the biggest 25 food-and-beverage companies, for example, generated 45% of sales in the category in America but drove only 3% of the total growth in the industry between 2011 and 2015 (see chart). A long tail of 20,000 companies below the top 100 produced half of all growth.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine, 25 years ago, coming up with the idea for a radically better toothpaste, suggests Randall Rothenberg, the boss of the Interactive Advertising Bureau ( IAB ), a trade organisation for digital advertisers, who studies microbrands. Raw materials would only be available by the tonne. No factory would produce toothpaste for a tiny new player. Ads would be hopelessly expensive so driving demand would be impossible. No large retailer would stock it.\n\nThat is no longer true, thanks to shifts in supply chains and data. The growth of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d manufacturing means startups no longer need to splurge on inventory. The surge in food startups meant factories had confidence to let him start with a small order, on the condition that future ones would be bigger, says Blake Sorensen, founder of Blake\u2019s Seed Based, which makes allergy-friendly snacks.\n\nOther service providers can pass on economies of scale once available only to consumer-goods giants. Lumi, a packaging firm, uses a network of factories to design and produce packaging for small brands. It represents thousands of brands so can get better prices.\n\nBusinesses such as ShipBob, a Chicago startup, do something similar with shipping, allowing small brands to offer faster, cheaper deliveries. E-commerce companies such as Shopify provide turnkey online shops from as little as $29 a month. Shopify handles the back-end infrastructure that would have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to build, says Steven Mazur, one of the founders of Ash & Erie, a brand of clothing for short men. Assembled Brands provides funding specifically to microbrands. It will invest in any kind of manufactured consumer-goods product as long as the company has started trading.\n\nMicrobrands can also sell their products through Amazon. The costs are high but it gives them access to the online giant\u2019s shipping services and huge user base. Many of the big firms have, by contrast, been reluctant to sell on the giant\u2019s website, so feature low in search rankings. More of them have started selling on Amazon in recent years, says R.J. Hottovy of Morningstar, a research firm, but it still represents a small slice of their sales.\n\nSelling directly to consumers means that microbrands boast a wealth of data. Mr Sorensen launched his business online in January 2018. He sold $50,000 of snacks and then, on the basis of data gleaned, Blake\u2019s Seed Based changed its recipe and relaunched in September. M Gemi, an online seller of posh shoes, offers new designs weekly so can respond precisely to consumer demands. Their giant rivals, by contrast, use data filtered by retailers.\n\nOnline advertising, using platforms such as Facebook, allows brands to target customers with great accuracy. The vast majority of growth in advertising is coming from the digital kind, and a large proportion of this is from small advertisers, says Jonathan Barnard of Zenith, a media agency. Meanwhile many big companies, especially the consumer-goods firms, are keeping their spending flat or reducing it in view of pressure on margins.\n\nConsumer-goods behemoths are well aware of the threat posed by microbrand ankle-biters. One response is to buy them. Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club, a subscription service for razor blades and now-canonical microbrand, for $1bn in 2016, grabbing the market share the upstart had itself snatched from Gillette. The biggest ten consumer-goods firms have all recently invested in direct-to-consumer startups. Nestl\u00e9\u2019s acquisition in 2017 of Blue Bottle, a hip Californian coffee brand, bought it exposure to new market segments.\n\nCompetition is fierce to buy the best microbrands so big firms may overpay for their acquisition, says Mr Hottovy. Explaining its purchase last year of Native, a small deodorant brand, Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer of Procter & Gamble, explicitly referred to its DTC model, saying it is \u201cwhere things are going\u201d. Other big firms are trying to grow their own brands. Earlier this year Kraft Heinz launched Springboard, an incubator for small, disruptive food and drink brands.\n\nIn the long term some small brands will be swallowed up but others will be encouraged, argues Sonali De Rycker of Accel, a venture-capital firm. More will want to remain independent for longer, or entirely, which will mean larger deals or IPO s.\n\nTo flourish, incumbents will not only have to acquire these new brands or start their own; they will have to learn from them. And instead of having a discrete set of multi-billion-dollar brands, sold through third-party retailers, they will have to come up with larger portfolios of smaller, more transitory ones, argues Mr Rothenberg. Scale still matters, but it will have to be used more shrewdly.", "T HE CENTENARY of the armistice on November 11th is a welcome reminder that historical memories can unite the country. It is an unfortunately rare one. These days history is more commonly used to divide and inflame. The right of the Conservative Party and the left of the Labour Party\u2014the ideologically ascendant factions in their respective worlds\u2014are wedded to sharply contrasting interpretations of British history, which focus on very different events and freight them with very different emotions. Let us call them the Waterloo and the Peterloo interpretations.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaterloo was one of Britain\u2019s greatest victories over the French. In 1815 the Duke of Wellington ended Napoleon\u2019s career for good and inaugurated a long period in which Britain could play Europe\u2019s leading powers off against each other, to make sure that no new Napoleons could emerge. Peterloo, in 1819, was one of the worst peacetime massacres in British history. Troops charged into 100,000 peaceful protesters, who had gathered to demand more political rights in St Peter\u2019s Field, near Manchester. Fifteen people were killed and hundreds injured.\n\nThe Labour left is obsessed with Peterloo. Jeremy Corbyn, the party\u2019s leader, highlighted the massacre in his speech to Labour\u2019s annual conference in September. The demonstrators were killed by \u201ctroops sent in by the Tories to suppress the struggle for democratic rights,\u201d he noted, adding that Labour\u2019s slogan, \u201cFor the many not the few\u201d, was coined by Percy Shelley in a poem commemorating the massacre. Mike Leigh, one of Britain\u2019s leading film directors, has recently released a film about the massacre called \u201cPeterloo\u201d. The two-and-a-half-hour epic is not up to the standards of \u201cLife is Sweet\u201d and \u201cTopsy-Turvy\u201d. But, partly because it is so caricatured, it provides a good view of the Corbynite historical imagination. The established rich guzzle food and drink, the new rich grind the poor with the help of dark Satanic mills and job-destroying machines, the poor try to improve their dismal lot through peaceful protest, and the establishment responds by crushing them. Maxine Peake, one of the leading actresses, has driven the film\u2019s message home by comparing Peterloo to the more recent disasters at Hillsborough stadium and Grenfell Tower.\n\nThe Peterloo interpretation sees British history as a story of ruthless exploitation and intermittent resistance. What few rights the workers enjoy, they have as the result of heroic struggles led by a vanguard of activists who must fight against both the ruling class, who try to suppress them, and class traitors, who don\u2019t understand the true meaning of history. Mr Corbyn is much happier talking about history than economics. His favourite historical figure is John Lilburne, a 17th-century Leveller who devoted his life to agitation. (\u201cIf the world was emptied of all but John Lilburne, Lilburne would quarrel with John and John with Lilburne,\u201d one contemporary said.) He is fond of Marxist historians like Christopher Hill, author of \u201cThe World Turned Upside Down\u201d, and E.P. Thompson, who wrote \u201cThe Making of the English Working Class\u201d.\n\nThe Waterloo interpretation of history is the opposite. It celebrates our island story rather than lamenting it (and frequently slips into calling that island England). This school reveres the role of great men, particularly great military commanders, rather than agonising about the labouring masses. It also focuses on constitutional innovations rather than economic struggles. For Waterlooists, England\u2019s unique achievement was to limit the power of the over-mighty state through constitutional reforms such as Magna Carta, the establishment of Parliament and the common law. These innovations made British history fundamentally different from continental history. Whereas the continent had absolutist rule, the Napoleonic code and endless internecine wars, Britain had peaceful constitutional evolution, protection of individual rights and a globalised economy.\n\nA striking number of the leading Brexiteers are either history graduates or history buffs. Sir William Cash, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Daniel Hannan all read history at Oxford. Mr Rees-Mogg has argued that Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union is \u201cas worthy for celebration as victory at Waterloo or the Glorious Revolution\u201d, and defined Brexit as \u201ca victory of British liberty over Bonapartist autocracy, and for free nations over foreign tyranny\u201d. Mr Hannan has written a book called \u201cHow We Invented Freedom and Why It Matters\u201d. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is an omnivorous reader of history books who, in an earlier role as education secretary, tried to refocus the history syllabus on teaching facts about British history.\n\nThese polarised views leave a lot to be desired on the scholarly front. The Peterloo interpretation ignores the role of judicious reform. The British ruling class did terrible things but it was restrained compared with its continental counterparts. \u201cOnly in England do they call that a massacre,\u201d sneered one French diplomat. The Waterloo view downplays the role of imperialism and plunder in the making of Britain. (It also downplays the fact that Waterloo was \u201cthe nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\u201d, as Wellington put it, and would not have been won without the help of the Prussian army.) Both views ignore the importance of entrepreneurial innovation and free trade in raising living standards. The starvation that Mr Leigh decries in \u201cPeterloo\u201d was eventually alleviated by the repeal of the Corn Laws and the import of grain.\n\nCouldn\u2019t escape if they wanted to\n\nThe clash of historical visions will remain at the heart of politics for some time. During the Blair-Cameron years, when policymakers all accepted the virtues of market liberalisation and quarrelled about means rather than ends, economics had a good claim to be the queen of the sciences. Today the crown has been passed to history. Economics has lost much of its lustre since the financial crisis. History, by contrast, appeals to people\u2019s quest for meaning and identity in a world that too often deprives them of both.", "M ORAL PANICS over new media are old hat. The social effects of novels, films, comic books and pop music were condemned by the grumpy reactionaries of the time. In recent years video games have been a popular villain. Exasperated parents and opportunistic politicians have long fretted that they make players lazy and listless, or else unpredictable and violent. Those concerns turned out to be largely misplaced. But new worries about the addictiveness of games, and the danger that poses to children in particular, have more substance to them and are already prompting a regulatory crackdown. The industry would be wise to get ahead of the problem.\n\nChina, the world\u2019s biggest video-game market, is leading the charge. The government clamped down on the approval of new games earlier this year, and stopped approvals altogether in October. Shares in Tencent, which built its business on video games and is one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, have fallen by 28% since the start of the year (see article). China is an authoritarian state prone to overreaction. But it is not the only country that is worried. Japan and South Korea, both liberal democracies, have passed laws designed to regulate a video-gaming industry whose products are increasingly seen as addictive and harmful. And as business models refined in Asia have come to the West, lawmakers in Europe and America are becoming more concerned, too.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch concerns feel more credible than prior panics, for two reasons. The first is that much gaming now happens online, and generates reams of behavioural data. This allows publishers to monitor exactly how customers are playing games, and fine-tune them to make them as compelling as possible.\n\nThe second is the realisation that players will happily pay real money for virtual goods. These can be upgrades, costumes or weapons for their in-game characters, or (more cynically) a lottery-style \u201cloot box\u201d whose contents are unknown in advance, but might prove valuable enough to resell to other players. Since the marginal cost of creating virtual items is zero, they are very profitable for developers. That has given rise to a \u201cfreemium\u201d business model, of which Tencent was a pioneer, whereby games are given away cheaply or free but players are constantly nagged to spend money on in-game items. All this has been supercharged by smartphones, which mean people can keep playing\u2014and paying\u2014at all hours of the day.\n\nThe result is an unhealthy loop. Firms strive to keep players hooked, because the more time they spend in a game, the more money they will spend on baubles within it. Whizzy data analytics let developers tweak their products to do just that, using psychological tricks and nudges familiar from social-networking sites and the gambling industry. All this can be extremely lucrative. Sensor Tower, an analysis firm, reckons that \u201cCandy Crush Saga\u201d, a popular game in the West, made $930m last year. The keenest gamers, known as \u201cwhales\u201d (a term coined by casinos to describe high-rolling customers), can spend thousands of dollars a year.\n\nTencent is trying to placate the Chinese government. It is expanding its age-verification scheme and limiting screen time for children. Its counterparts in other countries should take note. This newspaper does not generally believe governments should tell adults how to spend their money. But the industry could do more to protect children and addicts from its increasingly sophisticated products.\n\nIt is in its own long-term interests to do so. Video games now rival the film industry for clout. Gaming is thought to be worth around $140bn annually worldwide, and is growing at 13% a year. But society\u2019s attitude towards technology is hardening. In a world of fake news and hyper-targeted advertising, voters and politicians have awoken to the danger that devices and data may be manipulating people in harmful ways. A little voluntary forbearance now could save a lot of regulatory pain later.", "E NGLISH UNIVERSITIES have long been defined by their architecture, from the dreaming spires of Oxford, to the red-brick universities built after the Industrial Revolution, to the concrete polytechnics that sprouted everywhere after the 1960s. Those who visit a campus today are likely to see another big round of building in progress. This time glass and steel are the main media, sometimes accompanied by cladding in garish colours.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rush to build reflects a battle to attract students, which is putting a growing strain on universities\u2019 finances. Universities receive twice as much money per student as they did two decades ago. But an increase in spending means that they are nonetheless racking up debt. Britain\u2019s 130-odd universities owe nearly \u00a312bn ($16bn), up from around than \u00a35bn in 2012, according to estimates collated by Reuters. In 2016-17, the most recent year for which data are available, 19 universities ran deficits, compared with six the year before. A few are said to be near bankruptcy. Some in better health are considering whether they would take over a neighbour if the option arose.\n\nThe competition for students is the intended consequence of a series of reforms introduced by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition in 2010-15, which aimed to get more people into higher education while pushing universities to pay more attention to teaching. The headline reform was to nearly triple the fees that universities were allowed to charge students, to \u00a39,000 a year. One reason for lifting the cap was to provide income for universities to borrow against. David Willetts, the universities minister at the time, has written that \u201cfinanciers always used to advise us that university balance sheets were very conservative.\u201d\n\nA less noticed but more important change was to remove limits on the number of students that universities could admit. Since they now rely on students\u2019 fees for much of their income, universities are keen to attract them. And since there are no longer restrictions on admissions, the most attractive universities can suck students away from the rest. This explains why borrowing has mostly been spent on sprucing up campuses. On an open day, \u201chow do you judge whether a university is good or bad?\u201d asks one university official. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge course content, so you use lecture halls or sports facilities as proxies.\u201d\n\nSince the financial crisis, bank lending has dried up. So universities have turned to capital markets. The universities of Leeds, Liverpool, Cardiff, Manchester, Cambridge and Oxford have all taken advantage of low interest rates by issuing public bonds, raising \u00a3250m-750m each. Less prestigious universities have looked to private investors, such as insurers and pension funds, in deals with shorter maturities.\n\nThe lowest-ranked universities struggle to find any lenders. It is also they who are running the biggest deficits (see table). Some institutions acknowledge that conditions are difficult: higher education \u201chas become market-driven and increasingly competitive,\u201d says the University of Bradford. Others point to particular circumstances. St Mary\u2019s University, for instance, says its deficit \u201cwas planned and focused on investment in areas of growth and student experience.\u201d\n\nThe squeeze is about to tighten. An unexplained fall in the birth rate at the turn of the millennium means that between 2017 and 2020 the number of 18- to 20-year-olds will drop by 150,000, meaning fewer potential customers. The government\u2019s efforts to cut migration will make it hard to recruit students from overseas to make up the shortfall. A forthcoming review of higher-education funding may recommend reducing tuition fees. On top of this, universities expect to have to increase their contributions to pension schemes. Some will \u201creach a point where it is difficult to make more efficiency savings,\u201d says Steven West, vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England. \u201cA shock is about to hit.\u201d\n\nMost universities will ride it out. Jason Rothenberg of MetLife Investment Management, an institutional asset manager, says one attraction of lending to English universities is good government oversight from a new regulator, the Office for Students (OFS). It ought to be aware of any difficulties before they emerge, since it checks on the finances of all institutions that register with it. University boards are also meant to monitor the finances of their institution. But some in the sector admit that small, undistinguished universities may struggle to attract board members of sufficient calibre to do the job.\n\nThe assumption among some universities and lenders has been that if a university gets into trouble, the government will bail it out. On November 6th Sir Michael Barber, the chairman of the OFS , said it would not. \u201cThis kind of thinking, not unlike the \u2018too big to fail\u2019 idea among the banks, will lead to poor decision-making and a lack of financial discipline, is inconsistent with the principle of university autonomy and is not in students\u2019 longer-term interests,\u201d he cautioned. The regulator\u2019s aim will be to protect students, not the university, perhaps by moving them to another institution or by arranging a takeover of their existing one. Sam Gyimah, the universities minister, said this week that it was not the government\u2019s job \u201cto bail universities out when they make reckless financial decisions.\u201d", "F OR ONCE , the outcome that was predicted actually occurred. Democrats took the House of Representatives in America\u2019s mid-term elections on November 6th, and will provide some welcome oversight of the White House when members of the new Congress take their seats in January. Republicans held the Senate\u2014with a bigger majority, which will make presidential appointments easier to confirm. Both sides declared victory. A starkly divided country now has a divided government. Underpinning the results, though, is the deepening of a structural shift in American politics that will make the country harder to govern for the foreseeable future. Democrats represent a majority of America\u2019s voters, but Republicans dominate geographically.\n\nDemocrats won the popular vote for the House of Representatives by a comfortable margin. Their position as the party that enjoys most support among Americans, thanks to its strength in urban centres, was reinforced by a surge in support from the suburbs, where revulsion with President Donald Trump was evident. Meanwhile Republicans tightened their grip on less populous, more rural states, easily beating Democratic senators in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota. In a country where one chamber of the legislature is based on population and the other on territory, this division is a recipe for gridlock, poor governance and, eventually, disenchantment with the political system itself.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breadth of the divide is striking. Ten years ago there were 17 states with one Republican senator and one Democratic one. From January 2019 there will be just seven. In federal elections hardly any candidates seem able to survive in opposition-party territory. Only six Democratic senators won their elections in states carried by Mr Trump in 2016. The picture is less stark for governors, but in statehouses the pattern reasserts itself. From January Minnesota will be the only state where one chamber is controlled by Democrats and the other by Republicans. The last time that was the case was back in 1914.\n\nThis equilibrium may be stable, but it is damaging for the country and for both parties. For the Republicans, the danger is a long-term one. For now, they hold the White House and have an increased majority in the Senate. But in a two-party system, a party that prevails while consistently failing to capture a majority of votes will one day find it is no longer seen as exercising power legitimately by a majority of voters. For the Democrats, the challenge is immediate. They may rail against a system that disadvantages them in structural ways, but cannot change that system until they can work out how to win within it. Running up vast vote shares in New York and California is all very well, but on its own will not deliver a governing majority.\n\nWhat is the way out of this impasse? The main onus is now on the Democrats. For their own good, not to mention the country\u2019s, they have to find ways to appeal in America\u2019s heartland.\n\nThat starts with exercising restraint. Yes, they should use their majority in the House to scrutinise a president who shows contempt for the norms that have constrained past presidents. They should look carefully at what has been going on in federal agencies, and investigate possible presidential abuses of power or misuse of the office for personal aggrandisement. But Democrats should resist the urge to use their majority in the House to take revenge, hounding the president in the way that Newt Gingrich and his Republican colleagues once hounded Bill Clinton. Prosecution should be left to prosecutors. It is not obvious, for instance, that there would be much to gain by investigating the circumstances of Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court. There is certainly no ground to impeach him, as some Democrats want.\n\nA second Democratic priority should be to show that they have the ideas and capacity for governing that can appeal to a broader swathe of voters. One way to do so is to make a good-faith effort to work with the president and the Republicans. There are deals to be done on infrastructure and on drug prices. They also need to make immigration less toxic (see article).\n\nIn 2010, when Republicans won the House during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and proceeded to block everything Democrats wanted to do, the White House argued that it was unjust for half of one branch of the federal government to stand in the way of everything else. That was right then and it is right now. House Democrats should not declare, as Mitch McConnell once did, that they will oppose everything the president does. There should be no repeat of the hostage-taking that saw the Republican House flirt with a sovereign default during Mr Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nPlenty of Democrats will counsel against holding back, arguing that the scorched-earth strategy that the Republicans used when they had a majority in the House worked perfectly well for them. Why, they will ask, should Democrats be the party of compromise in the name of better government, when their opponents have so often refused to give an inch?\n\nFor two reasons. First, it might just yield results. Admittedly, Mr Trump\u2019s recent behaviour does not bode well. Accusing Democrats of facilitating the murder of policemen, as he did in the closing stages of the campaign, is not the best way to foster bipartisan spirits. Mr Trump could give up on the idea of signing any legislation in the next two years, preferring to rule by executive order, while ranting against the opposition.\n\nBut he may also surprise, proving more willing to deal with Democrats than other Republican presidents have been. The Trump motivating principle is self-interest rather than party loyalty. He has proved willing to discard some long-standing party positions, for good and ill. The role of dealmaker-in-chief could rather suit his ego.\n\nSecond, even if bipartisan efforts fail, behaving responsibly is in Democrats\u2019 long-term interests. By and large, Democrats want the federal government to work well. Republicans, by contrast, still consider the words \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d to be a micro-aggression. Gridlock does nothing for confidence in government, which is something Democrats need if they are to win more voters\u2019 confidence. Like it or not, they have more to lose from dysfunction than Republicans do.", "O N NOVEMBER 6TH the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates health and social care, took the unusual step of warning local authorities that a care company was at risk of collapse. Allied Healthcare, which provides services such as washing and meals to 9,300 elderly people in their own homes, insists there is nothing to worry about. Yet councils are preparing for the worst.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllied\u2019s difficulties are a reminder of the pressure on the care sector. A higher minimum wage and tighter regulations have added to care providers\u2019 costs. At the same time their main customers, local authorities, are facing funding cuts and are reluctant to pay more for services.\n\nThis disjuncture is most evident in care homes, a business worth about \u00a316bn ($21bn) a year, with over 400,000 residents. The number of people over 85 is expected to increase by 36% by 2025. Yet care homes have been closing, unable to make ends meet. By one estimate England has lost 3,700 beds since 2012.\n\nIt hardly looks like a promising market. But one corner of the industry has attracted the attention of investors, including foreign funds, which have been snapping up British care homes. By changing the way such homes operate, and rethinking who their customers are, investors see a way to make a good return. But with this change comes a widening gap between north and south, as well as between rich and poor.\n\nTake Skylark House in Horsham, Sussex. The spotless, two-year-old facility has 82 bedrooms, each with an en-suite wetroom and most with a balcony. It is owned by Care UK , the fourth-largest provider in the country, which has built 40 homes since 2011 and has 33 more in the pipeline.\n\nCare UK\u2019 s boss, Andrew Knight, argues that the only way to provide this sort of care is to take more residents who pay their own way. Councils in England are obliged to pay for anyone with assets of under \u00a314,250. But often the council\u2019s contribution does not cover the full cost. In Care UK \u2019 s homes, councils pay about \u00a3650 a week, whereas \u201cself-funders\u201d pay \u00a3900. Care UK used to work mostly for local authorities. Now half its residents are self-funders. Mr Knight says he will no longer provide beds at below cost. That will rule out most local-authority customers, but means the company can operate with margins of about 10%.\n\nThe self-funding market has caught the eye of American investors, primarily real-estate investment trusts ( REITS ). The biggest in Britain is Welltower, which has 107 care homes with 7,500 beds, worth \u00a32.2bn. Only a few of its homes take council-funded residents, as the firm prefers to \u201cavoid the risks of dealing with the government pay sector,\u201d says Justin Skiver, an executive. Other REITS buying homes include Target Healthcare and Impact Healthcare.\n\nThe care-homes market is still fragmented, with about 5,500 operators. The five biggest have just 15% of the market between them. Some see scope to grow by acquisition, gaining economies of scale.\n\nThe investments will increase capacity and may spur innovation. But the price is a bigger divide between those who can pay and those who cannot. And there may be a hidden cost to the taxpayer. As providers focus on self-funders and council-funded beds dry up, hospitals could find themselves taking up the slack.", "W ITH LESS than five months before Brexit is due, debate over possible deals is hotting up. Revelations of lawbreaking by Leave campaigns in 2016 are now adding fuel to the fire. The focus is on Arron Banks, an ebullient insurer who dubs himself the \u201cbad boy of Brexit\u201d. Mr Banks, whose gift of \u00a38m ($12m) to Leave .EU, an unofficial Brexit campaign, was Britain\u2019s biggest-ever political donation, has been having a busy time with official watchdogs. He has been referred by the Electoral Commission to the police. His insurance firm, Eldon, and Leave .EU have been fined \u00a3135,000 by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office for misuse of personal data. And the Financial Conduct Authority is looking into Eldon\u2019s practices.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Banks denies any wrongdoing. He claims to be a victim of hardcore Remainers bent on overturning the Brexit vote. Yet the evidence is against him. The Electoral Commission declares baldly that it has reason to believe that the source of the \u00a38m was impermissible because it was foreign. Mr Banks says the money came from a British-based firm, Rock Services. But this small service group is owned by Rock Holdings, registered in the foreign jurisdiction of the Isle of Man. And the \u00a38m was recorded in the accounts of Rock Holdings, not Rock Services.\n\nThe Electoral Commission has called in the cops partly because it has few resources and no foreign jurisdiction. But it is also because its maximum fine is just \u00a320,000, a trivial amount for potentially criminal offences. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office also has few resources and insufficient powers to deal with what it calls a disturbing disregard for voters\u2019 personal privacy. Insurance clients and Brexit supporters were bombarded with messages pushing each other\u2019s interests. There are also claims that Eldon employees worked for Leave .EU. Yet Mr Banks\u2019s response to the fines imposed for misuse of data was to tweet \u201cso what?\u201d\n\nThis sorry tale raises concerns over electoral laws besides the perennial worry of regulators with too few powers. Social media and targeted campaigns have become newly significant in politics. The illicit harvesting of personal data during the Brexit campaign by the likes of Cambridge Analytica, a defunct data firm that the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office says it may yet prosecute, was huge and sophisticated. Many countries now fear foreign intrusion, especially from Russia. Interviewed on television, Mr Banks oddly denied that Russian money was involved even before being asked. He has a Russian wife and business interests and has admitted to extensive contacts with Russian officials during the referendum.\n\nRemainers are up in arms over what many claim was a stolen vote. But it is hard to assess the effects of careful selection of social-media targets for pro-Brexit propaganda. Vote Leave, not Leave .EU, was the officially designated campaign organisation. Although it too was fined for overspending, the two groups hated each other. The 52%-48% Leave victory in 2016 was narrow but clear-cut. And the government itself spent \u00a39m on a leaflet promoting Remain.\n\nThe Banks affair has strengthened those calling for a fresh vote on a Brexit deal. Ironically, Mr Banks himself now says it might have been better to back Remain. This week a Survation poll for Channel 4 found a 54%-46% majority agreeing. Brexit may not be done yet.", "B RITAIN IS AT peace and unemployment is down. Good news for most, but not for its armed forces. They are struggling to attract recruits, owing to fierce competition for workers and a lack of exciting overseas action. Mid-career squaddies are leaving, lured by juicier wages and better prospects for promotion in the private sector, particularly for those with skills in areas like cyber-security or engineering. Salaries in the ranks start at just \u00a315,230 ($20,030). As a result, the forces are losing troops faster than they can replace them. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) fell 24% short of its recruitment target last year.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo plug this gap, it is widening the pool from which it recruits. Last month all roles were opened to women, who were previously barred from positions involving close combat. This week the MOD said it would start accepting applications from citizens of all 53 countries of the Commonwealth. That decision waived a requirement imposed in 2013 that such recruits must have lived in Britain for five years before they could join up. It is hoped that the Commonwealth will provide 1,350 new troops a year, equivalent to more than 10% of the number currently recruited.\n\nRecruiting foreign folk who have never lived within the country\u2019s borders is unusual, says Jack Watling of RUSI , a defence think-tank. Other European countries seeking to bolster their ranks are turning to conscription, which has been reintroduced in Sweden and Lithuania amid heightening tensions with Russia. Some countries recruit foreigners directly from overseas, but they are usually put in segregated units like France\u2019s Foreign Legion. In Britain they will join mainstream ones, with squaddies from Scunthorpe fighting alongside farmhands fresh from Fiji.\n\nThe idea may yet catch on elsewhere. Facing similar shortages, Germany is weighing up whether to offer citizenship in return for military service to people from elsewhere in the European Union. But it could also arouse post-colonial prickliness. Commonwealth governments may resent their citizens joining a foreign army, especially if they start seeing their best soldiers leave to seek better pay, says Paul Schulte, a former official at the MOD .\n\nWomen and foreigners alone are unlikely to fill the recruitment gap. Many specialist roles with shortages are already open to female troops. And once trained, foreign troops are no less likely to defect to the private sector than the current lot.\n\nThe branch facing the worst shortfall is the army. In 2012 it handed its recruitment operation to Capita, an outsourcing firm. By subcontracting tasks such as security vetting, the company has created a bureaucratic tangle, with some recruits waiting 18 months to get onto a training course. Many drop out. Capita insists that the worst kinks are being ironed out, but it is on course to meet just 50% of this year\u2019s quota. The firm will be responsible for recruiting most of the new Commonwealth troops, who will be harder to vet than locals.\n\nThe promise of action is the best recruiting sergeant, says Mr Schulte. Without war, soldiering involves a lot of sitting around in tents. Unless it is forced to spend blood overseas, the government may have to spend treasure on higher pay at home if it wants to keep the numbers up.", "I N 2016 AYO ADEWUNMI , a Nigerian-born agricultural trader living in London, bought a five-hectare farm in his homeland. It has produced little since. \u201cI am not in the country, so I have to rely on third parties. It\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d he says.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Adewunmi has since discovered another, potentially more satisfactory way to make such investments: through FarmCrowdy, a crowdfunding platform that lends to Nigerian farms and provides technical assistance to their owners. The two-year-old startup, which is considering expanding into Ghana, places high hopes in the African diaspora as a source of funds.\n\nThe case for such platforms goes beyond agriculture. Global remittances are expected to soar from $468bn in 2010 to $667bn in 2019. They are among the top two foreign-currency sources in several countries, including Kenya and the Philippines. Yet hardly any of the money is invested.\n\nIn part, this is because recipients use three-quarters of the money for basics such as food and housing. But it is also because emigrants who want to invest back home have few options. New investment channels could attract lots of extra cash\u2014about $73bn a year in Commonwealth countries alone, according to research by the 53-country grouping.\n\nCrowdfunding platforms would enable investors to put modest sums directly into smaller businesses in developing countries, which are often cash-starved. Yet of the emerging world\u2019s 85 debt- and equity-crowdfunding ventures, only a handful raise money abroad. Several platforms set up in rich countries over the past decade to invest in developing countries, including Emerging Crowd, Homestrings and Enable Impact, quickly folded.\n\nA big problem is that few developing countries have rules about crowdfunding. Many have allowed activity so far chiefly because the industry is so small, says Anton Root of Allied Crowds, a consultancy. Cross-border transfers using such platforms easily fall foul of rich countries\u2019 rules intended to stop money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nSome developing countries have realised that they need to act. Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia have all recently passed regulations on equity crowdfunding or peer-to-peer lending. But from a cross-border perspective, Africa seems most inventive, owing to active entrepreneurs and Western help.\n\nLast month the British government approved a grant of \u00a3230,000 ($300,000) to the African Crowdfunding Association to help it craft model accreditation and investor-protection rules. Elizabeth Howard of LelapaFund, a platform focused on east Africa, is part of an effort to see such rules adopted across the continent. That would help reassure sending countries that transfers do not end up in the wrong hands, she says. She hopes to enlist the support of the Central Bank of West African States, which oversees eight Francophone countries, at a gathering of crowdfunders and regulators sponsored by the French government in Dakar, in Senegal, this month.\n\nThameur Hemdane of Afrikwity, a platform targeting Francophone Africa, says the industry will also study whether prospective laws could be expanded to the Central African Economic and Monetary Community, a grouping of six countries. Harmonised rules will not guarantee crowdfunders\u2019 success, but would be a useful step towards raising the amount of diaspora capital that is put to productive use.", "THE European People\u2019s Party (EPP), the main centre-right block in EU politics, this afternoon elected Manfred Weber its lead candidate for next May\u2019s European election, by a margin of 79% to 21%. Under a precedent established at the last election, in 2014, the \u201cSpitzenkandidat\u201d (as the role is sometimes called, using its original German version) of the largest group in the European Parliament has an unofficial mandate to become president of the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive. The EPP is the largest group and is likely to remain it next year, so Mr Weber\u2014a softly-spoken, folksy Bavarian from the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), a partner of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union\u2014is now the clear frontrunner.\n\nThat is a missed opportunity. Mr Weber is a down-to-earth type and a pro-European moderate within the CSU. As the EPP\u2019s leader in the European Parliament, he knows Brussels and its institutions and is a deft deal-broker and compromise-finder. But the point of the Spitzenkandidat process is to lend the European election\u2014still more like a series of simultaneous national contests than a unified continental one\u2014an EU-wide dimension. It is also to strengthen the link between citizens and the Commission. Alexander Stubb, the former Finnish prime minister who ran against Mr Weber for the candidacy, would have been better suited to those tasks. He is a more multilingual, charismatic and persuasive figure than the technocratic Bavarian. But the latter\u2019s close link to power-brokers in Brussels and national capitals, including Mrs Merkel, won the day. Speaking off-the-record to your correspondent in Helsinki, some EPP staffers (even German ones) expressed disappointment at the missed opportunity to rejuvenate European politics.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ideological gap between the two men is modest and both played it down in a \u201cdebate\u201d (more of a panel discussion) yesterday. But it is not insignificant. Mr Weber has long attracted criticism for his reluctance to stand up to Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s increasingly autocratic prime minister, whose Fidesz party remains, scandalously, a member of the EPP. Mr Stubb lacks this baggage and is a more instinctive social and economic liberal. As lead candidate and perhaps Commission president he would have made a more natural partner to Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s centrist president. Mr Weber represents more continuity with Jean-Claude Juncker, the current Commission president and the first to be selected under the Spitzenkandidat process.\n\nWith today\u2019s vote the contours of the contest, such as it is, for the Commission presidency are clearer. The centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the second largest group in the Parliament, have just one remaining contender to be their lead candidate: Frans Timmermans, the avuncular Dutch vice-president of the Commission. ALDE, the liberals, gather in Madrid tomorrow where prospective candidates will start throwing their hats into the ring ahead of a selection in February (party sources say a two-person candidacy is a possibility). A putative new group built around Mr Macron\u2019s En Marche!, which may form an alliance with ALDE, is yet to set out its plans, but is not keen on a rigid Spitzenkandidat process.\n\nThe contest is not as simple as it looks at first sight. There is nothing automatic about the \u201cwinning\u201d candidate\u2019s path to the Berlaymont building, the Commission\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. That choice still lies in the hands of heads of government, many of whom are still sceptical about the Spitzenkandidat logic. In 2014 Mrs Merkel was persuaded to accept it only by a prolonged campaign by influential Germans in Brussels and, especially, the powerful Bild tabloid. Some in Brussels wonder whether the chancellor would privately like to lever a German with more gravitas than Mr Weber, perhaps Peter Altmaier, her loyal economics minister, into the job. Moreover, the leaders\u2019 choice must secure a majority in the European Parliament. The EPP will probably lose seats in May\u2019s election. So will the S&D, with which it has traditionally cut majority-commanding deals divvying up the EU\u2019s big jobs. Together the two may lose their joint majority. That, combined with Mr Weber\u2019s conservatism by western European standards (if not within his own CSU), makes his backing by a centrist majority in the Parliament questionable.\n\nIn that respect, today\u2019s choice may have opened another door. By selecting Mr Weber over the more widely appealing Mr Stubb, the EPP may have laid the foundations of a rejection for its \u201cwinning\u201d candidate when he goes before the next Parliament. Then the search would be on for an alternative figure acceptable to governments and a majority of MPs spanning several different political families. Alternative EPP contenders like Mr Stubb, Mr Altmaier, Michel Barnier (the Commission\u2019s Brexit negotiator, whose wide-ranging speech in Helsinki today sounded like an application for the presidency) and Ursula von der Leyen (the German defence minister) could all be compromise candidates. Each has strengths. But most intriguing\u2014and from a reformist perspective, promising\u2014is an idea doing the round in backrooms of the EPP conference: the selection of a non-EPP figure acceptable to S&D, ALDE, Macroniste and perhaps even Green MEPs. If Magrethe Vestager, the dynamic Danish competition commissioner who is taking on American tech giants and whose fans include the French president, secures the ALDE lead candidacy, she would be a prime contender for this role. Her election would be a welcome step for European renewal. She may announce her bid as early as tomorrow.\n\nAbsolutely none of this is certain. These are unpredictable times: Europe\u2019s centre is fragmenting and, in parts of the continent, weakening. There is no consensus around how forcefully the Spitzenkandidat logic should dictate the choice of new Commission president. The EPP itself is a fragile alliance, stretching from internationalist liberalism to illiberal nationalism. The dividing up of jobs in Brussels after the May election will involve all the usual horse-trading: a big job for the EPP will come at the price of a big job for the S&D and perhaps one too for the ALDE-Macroniste alliance, especially if it overtakes the centre-left and comes second. There will need to be something for the EU\u2019s north and its south, its east and the west. There will be a gesture, albeit half-hearted, towards a gender balance. Other posts in the mix will include the presidencies of the Council and the Parliament and, beyond the EU institutions, the top jobs at the European Central Bank and NATO.\n\nTo predict the outcome of this churning would be folly, especially in times of such flux and fragmentation in European politics. But in the balance of probabilities, the prospects of a fresh and decisive hand on the Commission\u2019s tiller did not necessarily diminish in Helsinki today. And in a continent where Mrs Merkel is on her way, Mr Macron is in a funk and anti-EU forces are on the march, that is just as well.", "F OR ALL the talk about deregulation under President Donald Trump, when it comes to the financial industry the word used by many is \u201ctailoring\u201d\u2014meaning trimming the loose threads of tangled rules, rather than unpicking them. An exception is Hester Peirce, who in January became one of the five commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), America\u2019s most important financial regulator. Since her appointment she has given a series of speeches with a polite tone and blunt message about the downsides of government intervention.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough she has yet to gain a large following, her words have not gone unremarked. Her \u201carrival at the SEC is genuinely exciting\u201d, writes Steven Lofchie, a securities lawyer who runs a popular (within the small world of regulation) blog. It is probably the first time the word has been used in connection with the SEC in years.\n\nMs Peirce is not partisan, criticising both the centralising trend under President Barack Obama and structural aspects of equity markets which date from Republican administrations. A common theme is the harms of over-regulation. She cites Nobuchika Mori, until recently Japan\u2019s top financial regulator, on the proliferation of international financial overseers. Surveying 140 projects by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisation of Securities Regulators, the Financial Stability Board and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, Mr Mori warned that \u201ctoo much medicine might make the patient sick\u201d.\n\nHer first speech, in March, concerned the impact of a rule drafted by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was set up in 2009. Its aim was to improve mutual funds\u2019 liquidity; in reality, she says, it has increased providers\u2019 costs and requires them to produce numbers that are useless, even misleading. She is similarly critical of the \u201cfiduciary\u201d rule, another Obama-era regulation intended to ensure that financial advisers act in their clients\u2019 interests. The reams of legalese required to produce an operable definition, she says, are \u201cwonderful for marketing purposes but potentially misleading for investors\u201d, and provide \u201ca false sense of reassurance\u201d.\n\nIn May she took issue with the Obama administration\u2019s conception of the SEC as primarily an enforcement agency. That encouraged it to bring as many cases as possible\u2014indeed to inflate their number by double-counting. The increasingly opaque structure of America\u2019s equity markets, with their stew of dark pools and bilateral trading platforms, has also drawn her attention. In another speech she noted \u201cthe strange role that the commission plays in directing\u2014and often determining\u201d this structure, and asked if it had \u201clost its way\u201d.\n\nIn September she took issue with the notion that governments should mandate representation of certain groups, such as women, on company boards. \u201cPolicymakers might be tempted to get this or that favoured group included,\u201d she said, thus introducing \u201cuncertainty and political influence into corporate operations\u201d. And in a talk to law students at the University of Michigan, she challenged them to include in their concept of the \u201cpublic interest\u201d helping companies in the \u201chunt for profit\u201d, which drives them to \u201cmeet people\u2019s needs using as few resources as possible\u201d.", "\u201cW HO IS KILLING Tencent?\u201d was the headline of an article on a Chinese business news site this autumn. Those sharing the link on WeChat, a social-media and payments service that is the crown jewel of the Chinese technology giant, see something else: \u201cThis title contains exaggerated and misleading information\u201d. The swap is ostensibly the result of a move by Tencent in April to sanitise content, after a crackdown on popular online platforms by government regulators, but is also self-serving. Scoffing WeChat users circulated the article just to highlight the switch.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be no surprise if Tencent were feeling touchy as it approaches its 20th anniversary on November 11th. Its shares, traded in Hong Kong since 2004, have fallen by 28% in 2018 (see chart). This time last year it was the first Asian company to be worth half-a-trillion dollars, hitting a record valuation in January of $573bn. It has since shed $218bn, roughly equivalent in value to losing Boeing or Intel. Other Chinese internet stocks have fared worse than Tencent, among them NetEase, a gaming rival, and JD .com, an e-commerce firm. But even so, the drop stands out.\n\nThe company posted its first quarterly profit decline for nearly 13 years in the three-month period ending in June. A regulatory hold-up that was blocking it from charging for new video games was the chief culprit, it explained. Although it has sprawled into all sorts of areas, from online lending (WeBank) and insurance (WeSure) to offline medical clinics (Tencent Doctorwork), the company still derives over two-fifths of its revenue from gaming. Its latest big bet in mobile games, \u201cPlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds\u201d, has accrued a huge audience of some 50m Chinese gamers who play daily, but because of the monetisation freeze, Tencent cannot cash in.\n\nThe government suspension, which began in March without explanation, had been expected to ease in the autumn. Analysts now assume that Tencent will need to tough it out until the second half of 2019. Even once game approvals start up again, the government has said that their number will be limited. To allay Communist Party concerns about the mental and physical health of young gamers, Tencent is also having to curb gaming time and set up a system of user-identity checks.\n\nCapricious regulators may not be wholly to blame for the slowdown in online games, says Steve Chow of Agricultural Bank of China International ( ABCI ), a Chinese investment bank. Users may simply be spending less time on Tencent\u2019s online entertainment, as other players eat into its market share. For its flagship game, \u201cHonour of Kings\u201d, for example, the average number of daily active users has dropped by a fifth in the past year or so, to 54m in September.\n\nFor skittish investors, all this has concentrated minds on whether the giant can maintain its momentum as it enters its third decade. Most agree that gaming will remain an important part of the company, but not its chief driver of revenue growth.\n\nTwo concerns are particularly acute. Because its games have done so well, Tencent has been lackadaisical in monetising other parts of its business. It has rightly been nervous about expanding advertising within WeChat, though the service sees unrivalled Chinese mobile traffic of over 1bn monthly active users. Last year Tencent took about one-tenth of total third-party spending on digital ads in China. But Baidu, China\u2019s leading search engine, took 19% and Alibaba, a giant in e-commerce, drew in almost a third.\n\nA second worry is that crimped profits will make it harder for the firm to keep investing heavily in areas outside its core business. Tencent has been backing promising startups in a race with Alibaba to find new users and sources of growth, battling indirectly in areas as varied as food delivery and online education. In some, such as cloud computing, the pair compete directly. Although Tencent\u2019s investors are supportive of this approach, Jerry Liu of UBS , a bank, says the wider tech sell-off stems from a recognition that China\u2019s maturing internet sector is becoming \u201ca zero-sum game\u201d: dominant platforms are having to invest more to stay ahead and so their margins are shrinking.\n\nTencent\u2019s first internal-restructuring plan since 2012, announced in September, offers a clue to the company\u2019s thinking. In it Tencent set out a long-term shift away from the consumer internet towards business services, marking \u201ca new beginning for the company\u2019s next 20 years\u201d. It has set up a new unit for cloud and \u201csmart\u201d industries, combining all its on-demand software and online services for firms that seek to go digital. Pony Ma, Tencent\u2019s boss, said the \u201cmain battlefield\u201d for mobile internet is moving from consumers to companies.\n\nAlibaba, born to bring businesses online through its virtual emporia, has a strong lead in this arena. Last year it took 45% of China\u2019s fledgling cloud-computing market, worth 69bn yuan ($10bn), compared with 10% for Tencent, according to IDC , a research firm. Still, Tencent doubled revenue in cloud services in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. Earnings from \u201cother businesses\u201d (ie, payments and cloud) overtook those from its social networks for the first time.\n\nMr Chow reckons that Alibaba and Tencent can both create large businesses in cloud computing since the market has lots of room to grow. And Tencent boasts powerful assets. WeChat is on over four in every five Chinese smartphones, so offers a massive market for firms. Last year it introduced a cloud-based platform that allows companies to offer services to users in WeChat via \u201cmini programs\u201d (ie, tiny apps). There are more than 1m mini programs, used by over 200m people every day.\n\nFor now, however, its revenue from such mini programs and other built-in services is still \u201cclose to zero\u201d, notes David Dai of Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm. Meanwhile rivals have introduced their own offerings of mini programs. Among them is Bytedance, a newish giant that has young Chinese hooked on its flawlessly addictive video and news offerings, curated with artificial-intelligence technology. It is a thorn in Tencent\u2019s side.\n\nIn particular, the way in which Bytedance is capturing very young users, as well as young talent, makes Tencent look increasingly grizzled. To increase its appeal to youngsters, Tencent in April revived a short-video app it had shut down, called Weishi, and made it a near-copy of Bytedance\u2019s wildly popular Douyin app.\n\nPan Luan, a former tech journalist who published a widely-read essay in May contending that Tencent had \u201cno dream\u201d, says the giant looks lumbering at times because \u201cits whole structure is ageing\u201d. Young staff say they have few channels for promotion to decision-making positions, says Mr Pan, and few opportunities to build sparky products, as Tencent spends on stakes in other companies. A young Tencent employee who left to work for a newer tech firm says that pay at firms like Bytedance and Kuaishou, a short-video app (in which Tencent has a stake), is \u201cin another band\u201d, and that they feel more like foreign startups.\n\nTencent\u2019s outsize influence in China\u2019s online world is ballast that should steady it as it targets business customers. For sheer scale, WeChat seems likely to hold its own. It has given Tencent a powerful distribution channel for its own games, and has allowed it to stymie new rival products, including Douyin, by blocking them from its platform. But the giant is under pressure, and seems to know it. \u201cWe have to stay awake,\u201d urged its president, Martin Lau, last month. Such introspection is necessary. Mr Chow says it was thought until this year that \u201cTencent could win every battle\u201d. With more formidable competitors on the scene, the company will need to pick its fights more carefully.", "In America\u2019s mid-term elections, the Democrats won the House of Representatives for the first time in a decade.

On November 3rd a 15-year-old was stabbed in the chest in Swindon. Two days later, an 18-year-old was knifed in the leg outside a school in Bedford. On November 6th two teenagers suspected of stabbing a younger boy in Manchester were arrested. The boy was struck several times in front of other children out for Halloween.\n\nBut the media has focused on London, where there have been 119 murders this year, about the same as the number killed in the whole of 2017, excluding terrorist attacks. Four in ten victims were 24 or younger. In the six days from October 31st, there were five fatal stabbings in the capital. The hosts of \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d, a television programme, berated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. \u201cSort it out, Mr Mayor!\u201d one said.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis narrow focus is partly justified. Stabbings are far more common in London than anywhere else in the country, and not only because it is so much bigger: it sees more violence per person than less populous areas. In 2017-18 it accounted for 22% of all murders and 36% of knife crime in England and Wales, though Londoners make up 15% of the population. Attacks in the capital also appear to be more ferocious than those elsewhere. Its murder count has risen more sharply than the country\u2019s.\n\nYet the biggest increases in knife crime have been outside London (see chart). Since 2010-11 it has risen by a tenth in the capital, and by a third in the rest of England and Wales. During the same period, knife crime leapt more sharply than the national average in the patches around Sheffield, Leeds and Liverpool. The number of stabbings began to tick up in North Wales, Norfolk and Essex well before they did in London. Jacqueline Sebire, assistant chief constable of Bedfordshire Police, recently dealt with four stabbings in 24 hours. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that people are placing the sole focus on London,\u201d she says.\n\nSome think the capital dominates coverage because of its concentration of journalists and politicians. They are \u201cseeing it more visibly than the trends outside London,\u201d says Harvey Redgrave of Crest Advisory, a consultancy. Mr Khan and Cressida Dick, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, are well known and so more likely to be held to account than a provincial police chief or politician. Others suspect politics. Tory-supporting newspapers have been quick to criticise Mr Khan, a Labour mayor who will have to fight an election campaign in a little over a year.\n\nThe best explanations for the surge are national. Labour blames spending cuts: the number of policemen has fallen by 15% since 2010. Meanwhile new demands on officers, such as a recent run of accusations of decades-old sex abuse, take up their time. Another plausible explanation is a shift in the drugs market. A boom in the supply of crack cocaine has encouraged city gangsters to expand into towns once dominated by small-time dealers. Competition has sparked violent turf wars.\n\nMisdiagnosing the spread of the problem could frustrate attempts to tackle it. \u201cA lot of police forces just want to deal with problems on their own patch,\u201d says Rick Muir of the Police Foundation, a think-tank. \u201cYou need to look at it as a national problem.\u201d Mr Khan might be feeling the heat, but responsibility ultimately rests with the Home Office.", "E XTINCTIONS ARE seldom cause for celebration. Humans are wiping out species at a frightening rate, whether hunting them into history or, far more threateningly, damaging the habitats on which they depend. But occasionally, the destruction is warranted. Smallpox was officially eradicated in 1980, and no one laments the fate of the virus that caused it; campaigns to save the virus that causes polio are thin on the ground. How, then, to think about a new technology that will make driving a species to extinction far easier?\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat technology is known as a gene drive, so called because it uses genetic engineering to drive certain traits through a population. Those characteristics need not be deleterious: they might include greater resilience to disease among crops or, perhaps, greater tolerance to warming waters on the part of corals. But if the desired trait were harmful, gene drives could in theory make a species extinct. And if the species in question were the three types of mosquito responsible for transmitting malaria, proponents reckon it could save close to half a million lives a year, many of them children. The same approach could be used against other vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, Zika and dengue fever. Gene drives also offer conservationists a potential weapon against invasive species such as foxes, mice, rabbits and rats, whose proliferation threatens native species in some parts of the world. (Humans are unsuited to gene drives, which work best in species that reproduce quickly, with many offspring.)\n\nNormally genes have a 50:50 chance of being passed on during reproduction. Gene drives tilt the evolutionary scales. One area of research focuses on genes that can copy themselves to the second in a pair of chromosomes, ensuring that they will be inherited by all offspring. Biasing inheritance in this way is what makes it possible to push a desired mutation, whether harmful or beneficial, through a population\u2014controlling its level, and potentially wiping it out altogether (see article).\n\nLike many technologies, however, gene drives may lead to bad outcomes as well as good. Opponents think the technology is simply too dangerous to contemplate using. Some worry about playing God\u2014though discarding an opportunity to save millions of lives in order to defend a principle is itself unethical. Others warn that the technology could entrench the power of big agritech firms. But that is an argument for ensuring competition, not for ending research.\n\nThree other concerns are less easily handled. One is practical: removing a species from the food chain could have unintended consequences, particularly if gene drives can move to a closely related species. Another relates to governance. Genetically modified crops can be kept relatively contained; animals carrying gene drives could be mobile and respect no borders. One country\u2019s decision to use gene drives will have consequences for its neighbours. A third worry concerns nefarious uses of the technology, and not only by states. A mosquito, engineered to inject toxins, could be used as a weapon.\n\nFaced with such risks, some want simply to call a halt. An attempt to impose a moratorium on gene drives was rejected by governments in 2016 at a United Nations meeting on biodiversity. Another such meeting, which takes place this month, will debate proposals that could hinder field trials. But putting the brakes on research may impose real costs: not just the annual toll taken by malaria and other killers before an answer is found, but also slower progress towards making gene drives safer. Since the decision in 2016 researchers have made advances on drives that die out over time, for example. That sort of approach could go some way to solving the practical concerns. Given that it will be eight years or so before a gene drive is expected to be ready for field trials, more can be done in the interim to minimise its potential to cause harm.\n\nThat will require a more robust approach to governance, too. The ideal would be a set of norms for states and funders to adhere to. These might include rules on the mandatory registration of gene-drive trials; on stringent sequencing of gene-drive tests, as they progress from laboratory environments to field trials; on ways for neighbouring states to monitor standards in any country that wanted to use gene drives; and on agreed criteria for the approval of any release, such as the existence of an unmodified population in captivity.\n\nRules or not, rogue states and other malevolent actors may still want to use gene drives for malicious purposes. And, like many new technologies, gene drives do not require big organisations in order to be made to work. Prudent countries ought to plan accordingly. America\u2019s government, rightly, justifies some of its gene-drive research as a way to develop better defences against harmful uses. In the future, improved gene-sequencing technologies should make it easier to spot species carrying malevolent drives.\n\nThese risks underline why gene drives must be managed carefully. They ought not, however, to obscure the prize on offer if the technology can be made to work well. Humans are already radically and heedlessly reshaping the planet. Gene drives would further enhance humanity\u2019s ability to shape nature\u2014but with the potential to do so precisely, efficiently and for the better.", "I N MANY WAYS , Bangladesh is a role model for South Asia.

They are characterised by an all-or-nothing, no-holds-barred aggression between two parties, the ruling Awami League and its main rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ). Disputes are most commonly settled not in parliamentary debate or at the ballot box, but through paralysing hartals\u2014strikes-cum-blockades enforced by partisan thugs. At the most recent election, in 2014, clashes claimed 18 lives on election day alone. More than 100 polling stations were set ablaze.\n\nThis week the Election Commission is expected to set a date for the next parliamentary vote, probably in late December. Things look calmer this time around. There have been no hartals; instead, the government has met with an alliance of opposition parties to discuss ways to improve the political climate. Even so, there is little hope the election will be fair (see article). The Awami League has spent its ten years in power systematically co-opting state institutions and hobbling the opposition. It has locked up hundreds of opposition activists, including Khaleda Zia, the leader of the BNP . Others have been executed, in the name of righting the wrongs of Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. Jamaat-e-Islami, a religious opposition party allied to the BNP , has been banned altogether.\n\nThe press has been cowed with a barrage of lawsuits. Critics of the government on social media are hounded. Unco-operative judges have landed in legal trouble. In 2011 the Awami League abolished the system whereby a neutral caretaker government presided over elections\u2014one of the causes of the furious protests at the subsequent ballot. The fact that the opposition has been relatively quiet in the run-up to the coming vote is not a reflection of greater harmony, but of the government\u2019s iron grip.\n\nPick your poison\n\nEven if the opposition were to have a chance in the vote, it would be unlikely to govern better than the Awami League. The army was so appalled by the corruption of the BNP \u2019s last stint in government, which ended in 2006, that it briefly seized power in an attempt to weed out crooked politicians before allowing an election to go ahead in 2008. (It tried to shunt aside both Mrs Zia and Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the current prime minister and leader of the Awami League\u2014to no avail.) In a leaked internal memo, an American diplomat described Tarique Rahman, Mrs Zia\u2019s son and now the BNP \u2019s acting leader, as \u201ca symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics\u201d who is \u201cnotorious for flagrantly and frequently demanding bribes\u201d. (His defenders say wayward hangers-on were responsible for misdeeds blamed on him.)\n\nThere is no easy way out of this mess. In an ideal world, Sheikh Hasina would call off politically motivated prosecutions, stop meddling in institutions that are supposed to be independent and reinstate the system of caretaker governments before elections\u2014things she shows no sign of doing. But there is scope for both sides to back away from their maximalist positions.", "N ORWAY\u2019S COUNTRYSIDE teemed with European soldiers in the past two weeks.

All were part of NATO\u2019 s biggest exercise since the cold war (see article). Yet this is not quite what President Emmanuel Macron had in mind when he called for a \u201ctrue European army\u201d on November 6th. Striking a Gaullist pose, Mr Macron urged Europe to free itself from military dependence on America.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Macron did not say precisely what he meant. Even so, his loose talk of a Euro-army is confused, quixotic\u2014and reckless at a time of growing transatlantic uncertainty.\n\nEuropean federalists have long dreamed of defence integration, but they have had little to show for it beyond some joint equipment projects and anti-piracy operations. The most ambitious plan for a common army collapsed in the 1950s because of French opposition. Since then, however, France has pushed lesser schemes to develop autonomous European forces. These were mostly blocked by Britain, which feared splitting NATO (whose integrated military command France left in 1966 and then rejoined in 2009).\n\nEuropean defence has returned to the fore for three reasons: Brexit will remove its most dogged opponent within the European Union; Donald Trump has shaken European faith in the NATO alliance; and France and Germany have been desperate to find common cause. But European leaders cannot agree on its aims: should it be a symbol of ever-closer union, a roving gendarmerie to police the continent\u2019s periphery or, as Mr Macron implied this week, a force that could beat off the very biggest powers, such as Russia and China?\n\nGermany is keen on using EU defence schemes, like Permanent Structured Co-operation, a cluster of EU projects launched with fanfare last year, to bind big and small European countries closer together. Mr Macron, irked that this gives priority to politics over firepower, proposed a European Intervention Initiative: a smaller club of more ambitious powers, open to non- EU members, who would jointly plan future expeditionary campaigns. Germany saw this as an attempt to drag others into France\u2019s African wars, but grudgingly signed up anyway.\n\nFor all these plans, Europeans would struggle to wage even medium-sized wars without extensive help from America, as they discovered during their air campaign in Libya in 2011. Though their defence spending is growing, there are still large gaps in their arsenals. In Norway, Europeans flaunted their armoured vehicles, air-refuelling tankers and transport aircraft. But data collected by the German Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank, shows that their stock of equipment in all these areas has been shrinking. The EU will be weaker still when Britain leaves.\n\nSo what if some fantasise about Euro-forces? If that pushes them to equip their armies properly, and stop duplicating capabilities, so much the better. The merging of Dutch, Romanian and Czech units into the German army is promising. The danger is that little new fighting strength will be created, giving America yet more reasons to feel exasperated with its allies. European leaders rebuked America for pulling out of the INF treaty, a cold-war nuclear pact, but until recently kept silent about Russia\u2019s brazen violation of the accord. Mr Macron was crass in talking of the need to \u201cprotect ourselves\u201d from America, in effect comparing Europe\u2019s awkward but indispensable ally to Russia and China.", "Each week, over one million subscribers\n\ntrust us to help them make sense of the world.\n\nJoin them.

Born in 1810 in Warsaw to a middle-class family, he was a child prodigy and became a noted pianist and composer of small-scale but exquisite Romantic pieces of music, such as ballades, \u00e9tudes, impromptus, mazurkas, nocturnes and polonaises. He was mostly based in France, mingling with the cream of Parisian society and the arts and playing for aristocrats and royalty. The German poet Heinrich Heine reverentially called him \u201cthe Raphael of the piano\u201d.\n\nIn 1838 he absconded to Majorca with the feminist novelist George Sand, who scandalised French society by wearing trousers and smoking cigars, and subsequently carried on a long and stormy affair with her. Having suffered since adolescence from a wasting disease, probably tuberculosis, he died tragically young, aged 39. By then he was, as he remains, one of Poland\u2019s best-known sons. His music is still played and enjoyed all over the world.\n\nSince his life was almost a Romantic work of art in itself, he has had no shortage of biographers, starting immediately after his death with his fellow composer and friend of sorts, Franz Liszt, and continuing in a steady trickle ever since. So was there a need for another one? Having previously produced a magisterial three-volume biography of Liszt, Alan Walker has searched for new primary sources from Warsaw to Washington, shed new light on many aspects of Chopin\u2019s life and cleared away a thicket of myths. He has much to say, too, about the political, military and social aspects of the age, including two revolutions, various wars, epidemics and natural disasters; he vividly brings to life the delights of Paris salons and French country-house living, as well as the discomforts of 19th-century long-distance travel and the horrors of the era\u2019s medicine.\n\nHow far studying a composer\u2019s life elucidates the music is an old and vexed question. Mr Walker identifies two schools of thought. One is that the music could not have existed without the life, \u201cwith all its joys and sorrows\u201d, so they are inextricably entwined. The other is that art must always be assessed in \u201csplendid isolation\u201d.\n\nIn Chopin\u2019s case, the issue seems moot, because the life and the music are quite unrelated. At times when his experiences were dark, he might write a brilliantly sunny piece, and vice versa. Chopin had no truck with programme music (the sort that tries to conjure up images or tell stories), in which other Romantic composers delighted. He laughed at some of his contemporaries\u2019 attempts to ascribe non-musical meanings to his pieces. Mr Walker\u2019s book contains plenty of analysis of specific works, but he is careful not to suggest any link between music and events.\n\nScrupulous as it is, this monumental biography is deeply engaging and enjoyable. Chopin mostly comes out of it well, and on closer examination seems a less exotic figure than his reputation suggests. He was a kindly man with a good sense of humour. Despite being something of a loner, he was able to maintain long and strong friendships, many with fellow Poles. He proved surprisingly adept, almost without trying, at attracting the financial and practical support he needed to keep on composing even as his health failed.\n\nAnd even though he was lionised for most of his life, he never took his gift for granted, agonising over each composition, crossing out, reinstating and crossing out again. However long it took, he laboured until each piece was exactly right. Because of this perfectionism, and the brevity of his life, his oeuvre is relatively small. Before he died, he asked for all his unpublished manuscripts to be destroyed. His sister, who oversaw his estate, demurred, thus saving a few dozen extra works for posterity. The world should be grateful to her.", "\u201cI SEE PATIENTS every day who are going to have babies because they work at Facebook,\u201d says Peter Klatsky of Spring Fertility clinic in Silicon Valley.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, \u201csupplements\u201d to wages, which include most of today\u2019s benefits but exclude performance bonuses, rose from 1.4% of total compensation in 1917 to 17.5% in 2000. Using a broader measure that includes performance bonuses as well as paid leave, overtime, health insurance and contributions to retirement plans, that share has risen further since: from 27% of compensation in 2000 to 32% now.\n\nWhen growth in wages slowed after the financial crisis, so did growth in benefits. Another trend also became apparent: a widening gap between rich and poor. Workers at the tenth percentile for wages saw benefits fall by around 2% in real terms between 2009 and 2018. Those at the 90th percentile saw a rise of 17% (see chart).\n\nWage growth has picked up recently as the labour market has tightened. Figures released on November 2nd showed that 250,000 jobs were added across America during October, and that average wages grew at an annual rate of 3.1%, the fastest since the financial crisis. By the end of the summer, there were over a million more unfilled positions than jobless Americans.\n\nBut growth in benefits for lower earners has remained sluggish. One reason is that few get employer-provided health insurance, which has accounted for about a third of the increasing cost of employers\u2019 benefits since 2000. Just one in four of those in the bottom 25% by earnings are covered, compared with three in four in the top 25%.Those working in the gig economy lose out on conventional benefits such as pension contributions. Meanwhile, at the top end of the labour market, bonuses are increasingly being used to retain the most prized workers. Aon Hewitt, a human-resources consultancy, finds that over four decades bonuses have grown to a record high, reaching 12.8% of payroll in 2014.\n\nThe gap is likely to be wider still when intangible benefits are included. The share of Fortune 1,000 companies with shorter hours on \u201csummer Fridays\u201d has doubled, to 42%, since 2015. Salesforce, a software giant, gives employees several paid days off per year for volunteering, and $1,000 to donate to a cause of their choice. Since such perks are more common at tech firms and in offices, low-paid workers often miss out. Unionised workers, who have more leverage with employers, choose to receive a notably larger share of their compensation as benefits than non-unionised ones. In a survey of American workers by FRACTL , a content-marketing firm, 88% said they would sacrifice a higher wage for better health insurance and more flexible hours.\n\nThe hope for low earners lies in the fact that they are often the last to gain from expansions. As the labour market has tightened, their wage growth has accelerated sharply. They may soon start to feel the benefit beyond their pay cheques, too.", "I F THE HEALTH of a democracy were measured only by the number of candidates contesting a presidential election, Madagascar\u2019s would be flourishing: a total of 36 were on the island state\u2019s ballot on November 7th.

Lorries blaring out his campaign messages are ubiquitous.\n\nEven with such a well-funded campaign, Mr Rajoelina faces stiff competition from Marc Ravalomanana, the president he overthrew in 2009 and who is fondly remembered for a tenure marked by economic growth and investment. The years that followed the coup, by contrast, were catastrophic: the economy dived and poverty shot up. About three-quarters of the population live on less than $1.90 a day.\n\nThe results of the first round will not be announced until later this month. But Messrs Rajoelina and Ravalomanana seem likely to face each other in a run-off on December 19th. Hery Rajaonarimampianina, the incumbent, does not worry them. He lacks the popular appeal of his rivals and has been criticised for failing to revive the economy since he took elected office in 2014. Almost all the other candidates, nicknamed les z\u00e9ros virgule, or \u201cnought point\u201d, after the results they are likely to get, ran with no prospect of winning.

They then use these data to work out when different demographic groups\u2014\u201cbusiness travellers\u201d, say\u2014walk by their ads. That knowledge is added to insights into traffic, weather and other external data to produce highly relevant ads. DOOH providers can deliver ads for coffee when it is cold and fizzy drinks when it is warm. Billboards can be programmed to show ads for allergy medication when the air is full of pollen.\n\nSuch targeting works particularly well when it is accompanied by \u201cprogrammatic\u201d advertising methods, a term that describes the use of data to automate and improve ads. In the past year billboard owners such as Clear Channel and JC Decaux have launched programmatic platforms which allow brands and media buyers to select, purchase and place ads in minutes, rather than days or weeks. Industry boosters say outdoor ads will increasingly be bought like online ones, based on audience and views as well as location.\n\nThat is possible because billboard owners claim to be able to measure how well their ads are working, even though no \u201cclick-through\u201d rates are involved. Data firms can tell advertisers how many people walk past individual advertisements at particular times of the day. Advertisers can estimate how many individuals exposed to an ad for a Louis Vuitton handbag then go on to visit a nearby shop (or website) and buy the product. Such metrics make outdoor ads more data-driven, automated and measurable, argues Michael Provenzano, co-founder of Vistar Media, an ad-tech firm in New York.\n\nAs the outdoor-ad industry becomes more data-driven, tech giants are among those to see more value in it. Netflix recently acquired a string of billboards along Hollywood\u2019s Sunset Strip, where it will start advertising its films and TV shows.

He built a list of 204 terms of reproach, signifying greed (eg, \u201cavarice\u201d), violence (\u201crapacity\u201d), extreme risk-taking (\u201cgambling\u201d) or opacity (\u201cmanipulation\u201d). He then searched the whole of those newspapers for uses of the words applying to 28 investment banks. During the period banks were roundly chastised, for example in reports by Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s attorney-general, in 2009, and by the Senate in 2011.\n\nMr Roulet found that the more disapproval a bank earned\u2014measured by the density of reproachful words in articles about it\u2014the more fees it earned too. Specifically, it was likelier to oversee initial public offerings of American companies\u2019 shares between 2007 and 2011. Of course, bigger banks attract more coverage; Mr Roulet controls for that, partly by using the density of critical words, not the total. And other factors also matter: the more shares a bank had placed in the past year, say, or the more \u201cbookrunners\u201d an IPO had, the better its chances of being hired.\n\nA finer analysis shows that adverse reports in the Journal gave a bank by far the biggest boost.

The custom co-existed with Islam, the main religion, which has historically forbidden figurative representation of human beings. Performances explore communities\u2019 histories, tell morality tales and limn the roles of men and women. They celebrate the coming of the rains and of the harvest. Masks and puppets stand in for people and animals, but also character traits, spirits and ancestors.\n\nThe country\u2019s rich cultural life has always been segregated by gender. In the renowned music scene, for example, women rarely play the djembe, a kind of drum, or the kora, a lute-like instrument. Women have traditionally been forbidden from operating marionettes, or even making them, a craft that entails complex rituals, conducted under cover of night and involving kola nuts and roosters. In these ceremonies, says Broulaye Camara, a fellow marionettist, male initiates determine whether a puppet\u2019s spirit will be benevolent. Women are barred, Mr Camara maintains, because they have not been initiated, and because they are gossips. \u201cWomen talk too much,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t keep secrets.\u201d\n\nMs Kon\u00e9, a tall 60-year-old with cropped greying hair, says the men have nothing to worry about. Her marionettes do not have spirits or powers because they are \u201cmodern\u201d, made of clay and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 rather than wood. She abjures the old-fashioned kind. \u201cI would never touch them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe marionette itself couldn\u2019t do anything, but the men around it could do very bad things.\u201d\n\nShe grew up in Koulikoro, about an hour from Bamako on the banks of the Niger river, a town known for its marionettes, masks and unique, sacred statuettes that represent the dead. She was born into a noble family in Mali\u2019s complex caste system, rather than an artistic one, and her parents did not support her ambitions. \u201cIt was difficult for my family to accept,\u201d she says. Of 12 siblings, she is the only artist, and the only daughter who chose not to have children, believing they would hamper her career.\n\nComing of age in the early decades of independence, she was a beneficiary of the investment in the arts made by Modibo Ke\u00efta, Mali\u2019s first president (from 1960-68). His government \u201cunderstood that the arts were a very important part of creating a national identity and bringing people together,\u201d says Mary Jo Arnoldi, a curator at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and an expert on marionette culture. Ms Kon\u00e9 was educated at the National Institute of the Arts ( INA ), a cutting-edge college that, says Ms Arnoldi, \u201cbroke down gender and caste boundaries\u201d and produced some of Mali\u2019s finest artists.\n\nMs Kon\u00e9 has broken many taboos herself. She made sculptures of torn vaginas to illustrate the harm of genital cutting, statues depicting domestic violence and satirical figurines of women wearing full veils\u2014a burgeoning practice in Mali, of which she disapproves. For all his scepticism, Mr Camara performed with her in the national marionette troupe in the 1990s, when urban companies educated Malians on subjects such as HIV and child labour.\n\nThis artistic progress has been violently interrupted. After a partial jihadist occupation in 2012, followed by a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, foreigners no longer attend Ms Kon\u00e9\u2019s performances and workshops.

Born in 1810 in Warsaw to a middle-class family, he was a child prodigy and became a noted pianist and composer of small-scale but exquisite Romantic pieces of music, such as ballades, \u00e9tudes, impromptus, mazurkas, nocturnes and polonaises. He was mostly based in France, mingling with the cream of Parisian society and the arts and playing for aristocrats and royalty. The German poet Heinrich Heine reverentially called him \u201cthe Raphael of the piano\u201d.\n\nIn 1838 he absconded to Majorca with the feminist novelist George Sand, who scandalised French society by wearing trousers and smoking cigars, and subsequently carried on a long and stormy affair with her. Having suffered since adolescence from a wasting disease, probably tuberculosis, he died tragically young, aged 39. By then he was, as he remains, one of Poland\u2019s best-known sons. His music is still played and enjoyed all over the world.\n\nSince his life was almost a Romantic work of art in itself, he has had no shortage of biographers, starting immediately after his death with his fellow composer and friend of sorts, Franz Liszt, and continuing in a steady trickle ever since. So was there a need for another one? Having previously produced a magisterial three-volume biography of Liszt, Alan Walker has searched for new primary sources from Warsaw to Washington, shed new light on many aspects of Chopin\u2019s life and cleared away a thicket of myths. He has much to say, too, about the political, military and social aspects of the age, including two revolutions, various wars, epidemics and natural disasters; he vividly brings to life the delights of Paris salons and French country-house living, as well as the discomforts of 19th-century long-distance travel and the horrors of the era\u2019s medicine.\n\nHow far studying a composer\u2019s life elucidates the music is an old and vexed question. Mr Walker identifies two schools of thought. One is that the music could not have existed without the life, \u201cwith all its joys and sorrows\u201d, so they are inextricably entwined. The other is that art must always be assessed in \u201csplendid isolation\u201d.\n\nIn Chopin\u2019s case, the issue seems moot, because the life and the music are quite unrelated. At times when his experiences were dark, he might write a brilliantly sunny piece, and vice versa. Chopin had no truck with programme music (the sort that tries to conjure up images or tell stories), in which other Romantic composers delighted. He laughed at some of his contemporaries\u2019 attempts to ascribe non-musical meanings to his pieces. Mr Walker\u2019s book contains plenty of analysis of specific works, but he is careful not to suggest any link between music and events.\n\nScrupulous as it is, this monumental biography is deeply engaging and enjoyable. Chopin mostly comes out of it well, and on closer examination seems a less exotic figure than his reputation suggests. He was a kindly man with a good sense of humour. Despite being something of a loner, he was able to maintain long and strong friendships, many with fellow Poles. He proved surprisingly adept, almost without trying, at attracting the financial and practical support he needed to keep on composing even as his health failed.\n\nAnd even though he was lionised for most of his life, he never took his gift for granted, agonising over each composition, crossing out, reinstating and crossing out again. However long it took, he laboured until each piece was exactly right. Because of this perfectionism, and the brevity of his life, his oeuvre is relatively small. Before he died, he asked for all his unpublished manuscripts to be destroyed. His sister, who oversaw his estate, demurred, thus saving a few dozen extra works for posterity.

A stalwart 19th-century scientist, she tramps the Pine Barrens of New Jersey in search of wax myrtle, swamp pinks and Venus flytraps. Her husband has left her for Victoria Woodhull, a suffragist who ran for president in 1872. Her intellect makes her the valued correspondent of Charles Darwin and his Harvard-based champion, Asa Gray.\n\nTreat plays a central role in Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s engrossing new novel \u201cUnsheltered\u201d, but she is no more an invention than are Woodhull, Darwin and Gray. She made her home in Vineland, New Jersey, a place that became a classic American manufacturing town but originated in the Utopian vision of a man called Charles Landis. He envisioned an agrarian community of homeowners whose lives would be untainted by the evils of alcohol. Half of \u201cUnsheltered\u201d is given over to Treat and her friendship with Thatcher Greenwood, a fictional teacher struggling to spread Darwin\u2019s new doctrine.\n\nTheir story alternates with that of Willa Knox and her family, who wash up in Vineland in 2016. When the university at which her husband taught went bankrupt, he and Willa lost not only a salary but their home. By lucky chance they inherit a house in Vineland from Willa\u2019s aunt; unfortunately, the place is a wreck. And in the novel\u2019s first chapter the joyous arrival of a grandchild turns to tragedy when the baby\u2019s mother commits suicide. The easeful middle age the couple imagined for themselves is upended. Meanwhile an unnamed, blustering candidate seems alarmingly likely to win the highest office in the land.\n\nMs Kingsolver knits these two narratives together masterfully. The final words of each chapter become the title for the next, a pattern expressed in the lives of the characters too. A Vineland house is crumbling in storylines nearly 150 years apart; relationships in both time-frames are unsettled by change; in-laws prove awkward. The novelist\u2019s stitching is never visible, only the beautiful cloth that results.\n\nWhat 1871 and 2016 have in common is a mood of revolutionary change. Willa becomes fascinated by Treat, her era and how frightening Darwin\u2019s work seemed to many: \u201cA great shift was dawning, with the human masters\u2019 place in the kingdom much reduced from its former glory.\u201d In the present, Willa and her family must learn to make new lives in a world of warming seas and melting ice. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to stop doing the shit that\u2019s screwing up the weather, and can\u2019t afford to pick up the pieces after we do our shit,\u201d she reflects.\n\nIf that sounds gloomy, \u201cUnsheltered\u201d never is.

Unravelling the genetic code would bring an exquisite understanding of bodies and their afflictions but also of minds. After the completion of the human genome project, which Watson initially led, such hopes faded. Individuals\u2019 physical or mental characteristics, and their susceptibility to diseases, turned out to be extraordinarily complex. Some of the swagger went out of genetics. Now it is back.\n\nIn \u201cBlueprint\u201d Robert Plomin, a psychologist and geneticist, explains the advances behind this resurgent optimism\u2014and their consequences for the science of human behaviour and psychiatric illness. He is well placed to do so: for more than 30 years he has studied the interplay of genes and the environment and their effects on personality. But Mr Plomin\u2019s enthusiasm for his subject\u2014he calls himself a \u201ccheerleader\u201d\u2014means the ramifications are not explored even-handedly. \u201cBlueprint\u201d is absorbing. For those with a disposition less sunny than Mr Plomin\u2019s, it is also alarming.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, psychology was dominated by the idea that human nature is a blank slate embellished by upbringing and environment. \u201cBlueprint\u201d begins by describing how Mr Plomin and others have demonstrated that, on the contrary, behavioural differences are strongly influenced by genetics. Studies of adopted children indicate that in disposition they more closely resemble their genetic parents than their adoptive ones. Even when they are reared apart, identical twins are more alike than the non-identical kind (who are as genetically different as any brother or sister).\n\nSuch research shows that, on average, DNA accounts for about half of the psychological differences between people, with the remainder due to environmental factors; the actual proportion varies with the characteristic in question. More recently scientists have combed through human genomes to identify thousands of genetic variants associated with particular traits, from height and weight to educational attainment and neuroticism. Tests costing less than \u00a350 ($65) can measure genetic propensity to different outcomes\u2014to be overweight, or to go to university.\n\nFor those who imagine all that leaves enough wriggle room for benevolent parents or teachers to exert an influence, Mr Plomin has bad news: these environmental factors are themselves substantially influenced by genes. For example, his work shows that genes account for about a third of the differences between the television viewing habits of children. Worse, the remaining tranche of environmental influence appears to be mostly attributable to unpredictable events rather than, say, being brought up in a house full of books.\n\nThese findings, says Mr Plomin, imply that \u201cparents don\u2019t make much of a difference in their children\u2019s outcomes beyond the genes they provide\u201d; DNA is a \u201cfortune teller\u201d that \u201cmakes us who we are\u201d. Environmental effects are \u201cimportant\u201d, but \u201cthere\u2019s not much we can do about them\u201d.\n\nMr Plomin insists that, armed with their genetic test scores, individuals can take action to counter or augment their innate proclivities; but they are hardly likely to succeed if their psychology is as delimited by genes as he suggests. An equally plausible possibility is that these scores will be used to stigmatise genetic \u201chave-nots\u201d or to justify discrimination. This is the high road to eugenics, about which Mr Plomin is largely silent.\n\nInstead he advocates the use of such scores when choosing between candidates for a job. Yet a person with high scores for traits associated with coding skills is not necessarily a good programmer\u2014they merely have a higher likelihood of being one. A candidate who had demonstrated their aptitude for the job would feel rightly miffed to be passed over in favour of a genetically gifted incompetent. Likewise, though doctors may find it useful to know that a patient is genetically predisposed to be obese, the best way to establish their weight is to ask them to step on the scales.\n\nThese are problems of emphasis rather than accuracy. But in a field as ethically fraught as genetics, even that can be troubling. For instance, as Mr Plomin notes, the size of the genetic component of a particular trait\u2014its \u201cheritability\u201d\u2014varies between different populations. The heritability of educational attainment in Norway has increased since the second world war as the country widened access to health care and schools, flattening out environmental effects. That trend seems, worryingly, to have reversed in America in the 21st century. The irony is that the heritability of many traits rises if states do more to provide for all their citizens equally.\n\nYou might conclude that without broad measures to tamp down inequalities of opportunity, genes have fewer opportunities to shine. \u201cBlueprint\u201d instead touts the importance of DNA in shaping the individual. Hubris indeed.\n\nCorrection (November 9th, 2018): The original version of this article described James Watson as one of the scientists behind the discovery of DNA.

Though Christian teaching is at the heart of the Western academic tradition, atheism has long been the new gospel for many intellectuals. Some authors have tried to subject it to the same scrutiny that religion has received. But, as polytheistic Romans found in the fourth century, challenging rampant orthodoxies can be tough.\n\nAlister McGrath\u2019s \u201cThe Twilight of Atheism\u201d and Nick Spencer\u2019s \u201cAtheists: The Origin of the Species\u201d are excellent critiques; but both writers are Christians, so they have been relatively easy for unbelievers to dismiss. It has taken a prophet seated firmly in an atheist pew to publicise the creed\u2019s contradictions more widely. That prophet is John Gray, a retired professor of philosophy at the London School of Economics. In several books published over 15 years, Mr Gray has reasserted his belief that there is no God, while also attacking the liberal humanism that has emerged in God\u2019s stead\u2014which, he thinks, is as flaky as the religion it has replaced.\n\nAt the centre of his argument, in books such as \u201cStraw Dogs\u201d and \u201cThe Silence of Animals\u201d, is the assertion that humans are no different from other creatures. Christianity\u2019s \u201ccardinal error\u201d is to say that they are. Yet dispensing with the teachings of monotheism leaves no coherent concept of humanity, nor of human dignity. Mr Gray uses this observation as a launch-pad to criticise \u201cNew Atheists\u201d such as Richard Dawkins, and to point out that most modern atheists do not follow their reasoning to its logical conclusion. They may have rejected monotheist beliefs, but they have not shaken off a monotheistic way of thinking, and \u201cregurgitate some secular version of Christian morality\u201d. Mr Gray has a much bleaker view of atheism\u2019s implications: \u201cA truly naturalistic view of the world leaves no room for secular hope.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cSeven Types of Atheism\u201d Mr Gray neatly recapitulates his arguments, combining them with a whistle-stop tour of modern unbelief from the Marquis de Sade through to Friedrich Nietzsche and Joseph Conrad. He gives Christianity its due, conceding that not all enlightenment began at the Enlightenment and pointing out the imperfections of that era\u2019s heroes\u2014the racism of Hume, Kant and Voltaire, for instance. Many of the saints of modern liberalism were not as secular as they might seem, he suggests. John Locke\u2019s liberalism is indebted to Christianity at every point; John Stuart Mill\u2019s insistence that morals did not depend on religion \u201cinvoked an idea of morality that was borrowed from Christianity\u201d. The new orthodoxy Mill founded was deeply rooted in Christianity, Mr Gray says: \u201cthe belief in improvement that is the unthinking faith of people who think they have no religion.\u201d\n\nHe is as exasperated with knee-jerk unbelief as he is with unthinking devotion, and has no time for several of the types of atheism he enumerates. All of them look to replace God with some form of secular humanism, science or politics. Their high priests tend to be just as blinkered as the ecclesiastics they abjure, Mr Gray complains: \u201cWhile atheists may call themselves freethinkers, for many today atheism is a closed system of thought.\u201d He decries a rising intolerance in academia, where free expression is jeopardised by \u201ca frenzy of righteousness\u201d that recalls the iconoclasm of Christianity when it came to power in Rome. \u201cIf monotheism gave birth to liberal values,\u201d he says of today\u2019s illiberal liberalism, \u201ca militant secular version of the faith may usher in their end.\u201d\n\nInstead, he is drawn to the more bracing denominations of the new church, such as those espoused by Spinoza and Schopenhauer, \u201catheisms that are happy to live with a godless world or an unnameable God\u201d. These varieties reject the idea of a creator and dispense with all pieties regarding human nature. They have truly emerged from the shadow of Christianity: \u201cNot looking for cosmic meaning, they were content with the world as they found it.\u201d\n\nMr Gray\u2019s provocative, frank approach has three main drawbacks. The first is that the God he says does not exist cannot be recognised as the Christian God. He suggests that it was the apostle Paul and Augustine of Hippo who invented Christianity, turning a local Jewish movement into a universal one that Jesus never intended, and turning Jesus himself from a prophet into \u201cGod on earth\u201d. Naturally this disregards the Bible\u2019s account of Christ\u2019s teaching about his identity and purpose. But it also contradicts recent scholarship that sees Paul less as a Roman who created a new faith than as a Jew who thought he was witnessing the long-expected fulfilment of Judaism. It is ironic that, having spent his career denouncing outmoded orthodoxies, Mr Gray rests his critique of Christianity on outdated perceptions.\n\nThe forsaken\n\nThe second weakness lies in his view that progress is an illusion: \u201cyou will find it hard\u201d, he contends, \u201cto detect any continuing strand of improvement\u201d in human society. You don\u2019t have to be Pangloss (or Steven Pinker) to demur; a glance at the history of medicine is ample evidence to the contrary. But the biggest problem is the void to which his skilful demolitions lead. What ought to be the basis for Western civilisation after the decline of religious faith? Mr Gray never proposes nihilism, hedonism or suicide, and seems (like Mr Dawkins) to believe that peace, prosperity, honesty and common decency are good things.\n\nHe ended \u201cStraw Dogs\u201d by asking, \u201cCan we not think of the aim of life as being simply to see?\u201d This might sound profound over port at high table, but may be less persuasive to people mired in abject poverty. It is not a premise on which to build a society. His new book is similarly lacking in constructive proposals.\n\nYet its reflections on the future are insightful. Looking beyond the squabbles over science and God, Mr Gray sees the challenges implicit in abandoning the metaphysical and moral order that Christianity once provided. Like Nietzsche, he says the West cannot ditch the faith and expect to retain congenial Christian ethics. It will be difficult, he predicts, for modern liberalism to ground a universal moral law on non-theistic foundations.\n\nRelieved as they are by the weakening of the church\u2019s oppressive aspects, many secularists have missed the flipside of Christianity\u2019s decline. In the absence of a single moral code mandated by God, says Mr Gray, people must accept a spectrum of moralities, palatable or otherwise: \u201cAnyone who wants their morality secured by something beyond the fickle human world had better join an old-fashioned religion.\u201d", "BEFORE THE mid-term election of November 6th, Elijah Cummings, a congressman from Baltimore, Maryland, swore that if Democrats flipped the House of Representatives, his party would do what Republicans have refused to, and \u201cconduct independent, fact-based, and credible investigations of the Trump administration.\u201d In January, when Democrats take control of the House, Mr Cummings will become chairman of the House Oversight Committee, the chamber\u2019s main investigatory arm.\n\nA zeal for oversight of the administration will be a defining characteristic of the new Congress.

Has the president worked to obstruct the inquiry? Would his tax returns reveal business dealings with Russians?\n\nThe list of topics on the radar of the Oversight Committee is much longer than that. It includes the high level of federal spending at Trump-owned hotels and golf resorts; spending by at least four foreign governments at Trump properties that could violate the constitution\u2019s \u201cemoluments\u201d clause, which prohibits federal officials from accepting money from foreign powers; and the issuance of security clearances to people with dodgy pasts. The committee will want to investigate politicisation in the selection of immigration judges; the scrubbing from government websites of information about family planning and other programmes opposed by religious conservatives. It will also been keen to probe the use of private email accounts and unsecured cell phones by White House officials\u2014who got their jobs after a campaign in which Mr Trump said Hillary Clinton should be jailed for such behaviour.\n\nOther big issues would come under the purview of one or more of the other House committees, where most of the chairmen also have unilateral subpoena power. They could include a potential subpoena from the Ways and Means Committee compelling the IRS to send years of Mr Trump\u2019s tax returns to Congress and probes into whether Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are still working to advance the family real estate business while working in the West Wing, as well as the business dealings, government travel expenses and perks of several cabinet secretaries.\n\nWhile some Democratic activists want the party to try to impeach the president, its leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Leader of the House, do not. Such a move would carry heavy political risks for the Democratic cause in 2020 if it failed, which is likely. Pursuing strong oversight would be a means of avoiding that.\n\nTheir investigations could proceed without complicating Mr Mueller\u2019s investigation. House leaders are determined not to undermine Mr Mueller with their own probes. But they will pounce if the special counsel is prevented by his bosses at the Department of Justice from doing his work. On November 7th, Jeff Sessions, the attorney-general resigned, at the president\u2019s request. Democratic investigations into Russia could become the most important congressional work of the coming year.", "T HE IDEA of underwater mining is not restricted to the ocean floor (see article). High water tables submerge many terrestrial deposits, too. At minimum, this means doing a lot of pumping to make them workable. Sometimes, it makes those deposits altogether inaccessible. Flooding also adds to the cost of re-opening closed mines. The team behind VAMOS hopes to do something about this.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Viable Alternative Mine Operating System, to give its full name, is being developed by a consortium of 16 European firms and research institutes. It is currently on trial at Silvermines, Ireland\u2014which, as its name suggests, was once home to workings for silver and other metals. They are now closed and flooded. But one of them, a source of baryte, the principal ore of barium, has been repurposed as VAMOS \u2019s test bed.\n\nThe core of VAMOS is a pair of remotely controlled vehicles. These are floated on-board a special platform into place over the site to be mined, and then dropped through the water (to a depth of 57 metres in this case) by a crane.\n\nThe larger vehicle is a 25-tonne tracked robot (pictured) with a powerful rock-cutting head at one end and, at the other, a hydraulic gantry that can carry tools such as drills and grabs. Crushed ore-bearing rock is pumped to the surface through a flexible pipe, and a cable carries power and data between the robot and an onshore control centre.\n\nThe smaller vehicle is called EVA . It has neutral buoyancy and swims around the mining site. It was designed at the Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science, in Portugal. EVA first makes, and then continually updates, a 3 D map of the area\u2014transmitting this cartography to the main vehicle, to assist navigation.\n\nBoth vehicles use sonar, cameras and laser rangefinders to work out where they are. They send these data to a pilot in the control centre, who sees them displayed on a multi-screen console of the sort gamers can only fantasise about. A future version may also be able to analyse the ore spectroscopically as it is mined, enabling rich seams to be pursued and poor ones abandoned.", "M OST SPIDERS avoid light because, besides being predators, they are also potential prey. But there is a set of circumstances in which living beside a powerful light is an advantage. This is when you are a web-weaving spider. Moths and other insects are attracted to sources of illumination such as streetlights. Those are found predominantly in cities. It would therefore make sense if urban web-spinning spiders had lost their photophobia, so that they could more easily set up shop beside such lights. And an experiment by Tomer Czaczkes of the University of Regensburg, in Germany, suggests that for at least one species this has happened.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Czaczkes\u2019s interest in whether city life shapes spiders\u2019 behaviour began when he saw lots of fat, happy arachnids building webs near Regensburg\u2019s streetlamps. Delving into the academic literature, he discovered that urban moth populations have been shown to be less attracted to lights than are their rural relatives. Presumably, this is because, besides any webs involved, the whole business of flying round and round such lights is a fitness-reducing waste of time and energy. He reasoned that a similar but reverse sort of logic\u2014resulting in their being more attracted to lights, or at least less afraid of them\u2014should apply to town spiders versus country ones. And, as he reports this week in the Science of Nature, it does.\n\nHe and his colleagues collected egg sacks laid by their chosen animal, Steatoda triangulosa (the triangulate cobweb spider\u2014selected because it is common throughout Europe and thrives in both urban and rural environments), from two sites in the Italian countryside, and also from Milan, Munich and Nice. The resulting 783 spiderlings were placed individually into boxes that had a dividing board through the centre. One side of each box was lit by a lamp that shed no heat. The other side was left dark. Two tiny gaps in the dividing boards permitted the spiderlings easy access to both sides of the box. Spiderlings were placed at random in the light or the dark at the start of their time there, and then monitored to find out where they built their first web.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of rural spiderlings built their webs in the dark part of the box, but only half of their urban cousins did so. That suggests rural spiders are indeed photophobic while urban spiders, though not actually attracted to the light, have ceased to be afraid of it\u2014not so much Steatoda triangulosa, then, as Steatoda luminosa.", "W ELL BEGUN, half done. That proverb, ascribed to Aristotle, seems an apt description of the art market\u2014at least it is if a study of artistic careers, published this week in Science, is to be believed. In this study Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, a physicist at Northeastern University in Boston, and Samuel Fraiberger, a data scientist at the Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences, deconstruct almost half a million artistic careers. They conclude that for artists, professional success seems often to depend on an early endorsement by the right set of galleries.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Barab\u00e1si and Dr Fraiberger used data from Magnus, a firm that collects information about the art market, such as auction sales and exhibitions, to build a picture of how works of art flow around the world\u2019s thousands of galleries and museums. The researchers\u2019 thinking was that the more places an artwork has been exhibited, the more demand there is for it\u2014and the more successful that artwork (and its creator) might reasonably be thought to be. This, in turn, by a process of feedback, permits a map to be made showing which are the most prestigious and important art institutions in the world.\n\nThe feedback mechanism Dr Barab\u00e1si and Dr Fraiberger used was inspired by PageRank, the algorithm at the heart of Google\u2019s search engine. PageRank determines a web page\u2019s importance not by looking at the contents of the page itself but rather by counting how many other pages on the web link to it, and how important those other pages are themselves deemed, by the same iterative process, to be. Dr Barab\u00e1si and Dr Fraiberger arrived similarly at a prestige rating for each gallery or museum, by counting how many other museums and galleries sent artworks to it, and then giving due account to how prestigious those places were themselves.\n\nThe algorithm showed, to nobody\u2019s surprise, that the art world\u2019s biggest nodes are a group of European and North American powerhouses that include the Museum of Modern Art, the Gagosian Gallery and the Guggenheim in New York, the Tate Gallery in London, and the Pompidou Centre in Paris. These places had the highest prestige ratings, and most of the world\u2019s most successful art had, at some point, ended up being exhibited in one or more of them.\n\nJust below the top tier, and less well-known outside the art world, were a set of institutions that also acted as important paths to artistic success\u2014being those that most frequently feed works into the top tier. They include the Leo Castelli and Paula Cooper galleries in New York, Galerie Krinzinger in Vienna, Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Paris and London, and Galerie Max Hetzler in Berlin.\n\nTheir mapping exercise also permitted Dr Barab\u00e1si and Dr Fraiberger to follow individual artists\u2019 careers. They were able to create an early-success score for each artist by averaging the prestige ratings of the museums or galleries which showed that artist\u2019s first five exhibitions. Remarkably, this simple early-career score gave the two researchers all they needed to predict an artist\u2019s future success.\n\nElite artists\u2014those whose score at the start of their careers was in the top 20%\u2014had only a 0.2% chance of ending their careers in the bottom 20%. Almost 60% maintained their elite status throughout.\n\nAt the other end of the scale it seems extremely hard to join the elite if you did not begin there. Of those artists who started by exhibiting in the bottom 20% of institutions, only 10% eventually made it into the elite group\u2014and around 16% stayed at the bottom. These figures actually under-represent the scale of the struggle that such artists face, since most in this initial group did not stick it out for long. Of those who started at the bottom of the success scale, only 14% remained in the industry ten years after their fifth exhibit. For the elite group that figure was almost three times higher, 39%.\n\nThe financial consequence of all this is that elite artists\u2019 work sells 4.7 times more often at auctions than that of those at the bottom end, with maximum prices 5.2 times higher. Which could, of course, be evidence of a meritocratic system working perfectly. After all, for a young artist to beat the competition for wall space in a top gallery suggests he or she is producing work of great quality. Cynics might be forgiven, however, for wondering whether talent is the only factor involved in getting those crucial early shows. A topic, perhaps, for further research.", "A S AN FBI agent for 29 years, Philip Scala led the operation that jailed John Gotti of Cosa Nostra and raided an al-Qaeda bomb factory. Mr Scala, now a private investigator, took on Hells Angels, rioting prisoners and Russian mobsters. Next on his list? The cardinals of the Roman Catholic church.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new lay group, Better Church Governance ( BCG ), has hired Mr Scala to probe the lives of the 224 men who advise Pope Francis (including their sex lives, if any). His particular focus will be the 124 who, were the pontiff to die tomorrow, would elect his successor. Mr Scala\u2019s team of up to ten investigators will publish their findings on a website, alongside carefully screened information from the public. Philip Nielsen, BCG \u2019s executive director, hopes the website, dubbed the Red Hat Report after the scarlet zucchetti (skullcaps) worn by cardinals, will be online within a month.\n\nThough apparently well funded, the BCG is a tiny fragment of Christianity\u2019s biggest church. Catholicism claims 1.3bn followers and wields vast, global influence. Its report would have seemed unthinkably disrespectful\u2014almost sacrilegious\u2014even a year ago. But in the Catholic world much that was once inconceivable is now transpiring. The Red Hat Report is a sign of how much many Catholics have come to mistrust their leaders and how far some will go to hold them accountable.\n\nThe loss of confidence stems from an enduring scandal over the molestation, and sometimes rape, of children by priests. It is unstoppable, since most of the revelations concern wrongdoing years or even decades ago. And it is seemingly inexorable: after the first disclosures in Ireland in the 1990s, the scandal spread through western Europe and North America; it has since reached South America and eastern Europe to assail erstwhile bastions of the faith such as Poland and Chile. In the ten years to 2010, the Vatican sifted through around 3,000 cases dating back to the middle of the previous century. Increasingly, however, attention has shifted to the role of bishops in covering up for clerics, often by posting them to other dioceses where they continued to abuse minors.\n\nThe BCG \u2019s founding was inspired by the publication in August of a document in which Archbishop Carlo Vigan\u00f2, a former papal nuncio (ambassador) in America, accused some of the church\u2019s most powerful men of ignoring repeated warnings that Theodore McCarrick, a former cardinal, was a serial seducer of seminarians when he was archbishop of Newark.\n\nArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 said the previous pope, Benedict XVI, had imposed restrictions on Cardinal McCarrick, but that Pope Francis, despite knowing of the cardinal\u2019s behaviour, eased them and made him a trusted adviser. He implied this was because the cardinal had helped Francis become pope in 2013. In an appeal unprecedented in modern times, he called on the pope, whom Catholics believe is chosen with God\u2019s aid and whose pronouncements on some issues are infallible, to quit.\n\nBetrayal of the innocents\n\nAlso in August, a grand jury in Pennsylvania accused some 300 priests of molesting more than 1,000 children over seven decades. \u201cPriests were raping little boys and girls, and the men of God who were responsible for them not only did nothing; they hid it all,\u201d the grand jury wrote.\n\nIn September the archbishop of San Francisco, Salvatore Cordileone, told an Italian newspaper, La Verit\u00e0, there was \u201calmost a sense of panic\u201d in the American church. A Pew Research poll in September found that 62% of American Catholics disapproved of the pope\u2019s handling of the crisis, up from just 46% in January. American Catholics make up a bit more than 5% of the global total. But their church, the fourth-biggest, matters far more than its size suggests. The Vatican needs its dollars, and its media-savvy cardinals often lead Catholic debate and innovation.\n\nAfter initially refusing to comment on Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s claims, Francis has since agreed to convene a global meeting of bishops in February to discuss clerical sex abuse. The Argentine pontiff, who had endeared himself to Catholics and non-Catholics alike with his benign informality and ascetic lifestyle, is on the defensive. \u201cIt\u2019s about as serious as it can get,\u201d says Austen Ivereigh, one of Francis\u2019s biographers.\n\nArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 was a controversial figure even before his J\u2019accuse appeared. The so-called Vatileaks scandal in 2012 centred on letters he wrote to Pope Benedict complaining of financial corruption, when he was a high-ranking official in the Vatican City\u2019s government. Theologically conservative, he spectacularly wrong-footed Francis on his visit to America in 2015 by getting him to meet Kim Davis, a clerk in Kentucky jailed for refusing to issue marriage licences to gay couples.\n\nA two-pronged attack\n\nVatican officials say the archbishop was called to Rome and rebuked for that. Critics depict him as a man with a grudge because he was not made a cardinal. But his document poses a unique threat to the pope. It embodies the concerns of two groups alarmed at his stewardship: traditionalists of various stripes who resent his reformist agenda; and Catholics dismayed by his handling of clerical sex abuse.\n\nFirst, the traditionalists. Some of the laity, notably in America, are appalled by Francis\u2019s economic and political ideas, set out in 2013 in his apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium. After the papacy\u2019s long years of hostility to communism, many forgot that Catholic social doctrine opposes capitalism too. They were left aghast by a pope who could write that \u201can economy of exclusion and inequality\u2026kills\u201d.\n\nIn many (but not all) cases Francis\u2019s neo-conservative foes line up with his doctrinal critics, whose wrath was kindled by another papal document, Amoris Laetitia, from 2016. In it Francis tackled the hotly debated issue of a ban preventing divorced Catholics from receiving communion. His critics were incensed not just that he relaxed a ban they thought central to the church\u2019s teaching on marriage, but that he did so in what seemed an underhand way, in a footnote. In the first open sign of mutinous sentiments in parts of the hierarchy, four cardinals put their names to a list of dubia or doubts, challenging Francis to deny that he was twisting settled doctrine.\n\nThe affair highlighted a fundamental division among Catholics, which centres on the buzzwords \u201cclarity\u201d and \u201caccompaniment\u201d. Many, particularly in eastern Europe, where believers suffered for their faith under communism, and in Africa, where they are nose-to-nose with fundamentalist Islam, crave clarity\u2014a religion offering straightforward, immutable guidance on what is right and wrong. In western Europe and Latin America, priests and bishops are instead contending with growing secularism. They are more ready to accept accompaniment, ie, compromise with the realities of the 21st century. This means accepting that many Catholics live with their partners before marrying, use artificial contraception, form same-sex relationships and get divorced.\n\nFrancis has never responded to the dubia. For his conservative detractors, that proves he cannot give plausible answers. For Francis\u2019s supporters, it is a way of reminding the traditionalists that, however vociferous, they remain a minority. That is probably also still true of the second group of his critics: those appalled by his inept response to clerical sex abuse. But this group is growing fast. Again, there is a geographical division. Few allegations of Catholic priests abusing the young have surfaced in Africa or Asia (though history suggests it is only a matter of time before they do).\n\nFrancis\u2019s shortcomings were exposed when he visited Chile in January. A local bishop, Juan Barros, had been accused of covering up for a predatory priest in the 1980s. The pope called the claims slanderous. After Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the head of his own commission for the protection of minors, publicly disagreed, the pope apologised. But on his flight home he repeated the charge of slander. In April, after a Vatican investigation into Bishop Barros, the pope admitted he had made \u201cgrave errors\u201d. But rather than have the bishop tried in an ecclesiastical court, he allowed him to resign. He has since accepted the resignation of seven more Chilean bishops and defrocked a number of priests.\n\nPondering the cardinal sins\n\nHas Francis finally got it? Cardinal Blase Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago, says he believes so, and that the turning-point for the pope was an encounter in the Vatican in April with three Chilean victims. \u201cWhen you sit across from a victim you can\u2019t help but be affected unless you have a heart of stone,\u201d says the cardinal.\n\nOn the defensive\n\nNot everyone is so confident that Francis has turned a corner. Anne Barrett Doyle of BishopAccountability.org, a campaigning website, notes the pope \u201cstill spends a lot of time talking about calumny\u201d. She points to a homily in September, describing Satan as the Great Accuser, who \u201chas been unchained and is attacking bishops\u201d. It was the latest of many instances when Francis has taken the side of his fellow prelates. That may be because he finds it hard to believe them capable of covering up for priests who preyed on the young. Or perhaps he feels a duty to afford his bishops the presumption of innocence. Or it may reflect unease over his own record: a documentary by a French filmmaker, Martin Boudot, claims that as archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis defended a priest who was later imprisoned for 15 years for sexually abusing children.\n\nThe meeting in February is expected to discuss possible reforms. Much could be done. Francis could overturn a veto on a planned Vatican tribunal to try bishops accused of shielding predatory priests. He could set up an inquiry into the use of the \u201cpontifical secret\u201d. A decree issued in 1922 still obliges bishops not to report certain offences, including child sex abuse, to the civil authorities unless they are in jurisdictions where reporting is mandatory.\n\nParticularly among conservatives, however, there is a growing feeling that Catholicism most needs, in the words of John Meyer of the Napa Institute, a lay group, \u201ca renewal of holiness\u201d. Mr Meyer argues that it is not only the priests and bishops who must examine their consciences, but lay believers who have grown used to flouting the church\u2019s teaching on, for example, artificial contraception. \u201cWe have fallen into the traps of the sexual revolution,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to take seriously our sins and realise our faults rather than just be angry at our bishops.\u201d\n\nSuch talk, however, is anathema to liberal Catholics disgusted by the clergy\u2019s record, but with no sympathy for the conservatives\u2019 wider agenda. Cardinal Cupich, from the church\u2019s liberal wing, argues that the clergy\u2019s abuse of its power is more serious. He sees a parallel with the #MeToo movement. If, he says, the unending scandal \u201cfrees victims of abuse of all kinds to come forward, then I think we should be willing to pay the price. Maybe it is in God\u2019s own providence for us to suffer.\u201d", "T HE SPANISH armoured vehicles were dug into the side of the road into Oppdal, a mountain village some 300km north of Oslo, cannons pointed across the snowy valley.

The alliance is flourishing on the ground, building up forces, transforming its institutions and squaring up to Russia with confidence. The question is whether this progress can be quarantined from the transatlantic squabbling between political leaders.\n\nThe very premise of the exercise\u2014an invasion of Norway, causing the alliance to invoke its Article 5 mutual-defence clause\u2014was a signal that, after decades of fighting ragtag Balkan armies and Afghan guerrillas, NATO is back in the business of defending its home territory. The exercise, officials coyly insisted, was \u201cnot directed against any country\u201d. But Lieutenant Boyd was clear that his marines were preparing to fight a \u201cnear peer\u201d adversary. He did not have to spell out whom he had in mind.\n\nA second message lay in the exercise\u2019s scope, stretching from Iceland in the west to the airspace of non- NATO Finland in the east. The last big war game was held three years ago in Spain, thousands of kilometres from Russian soil. Norway, by contrast, is not only a front-line ally, sharing a 200km border with Russia, but has also watched nervously as Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet, headquartered across the Barents Sea on the Kola Peninsula, has piled up new ships and increased submarine patrols tenfold. That has forced NATO to reacquaint itself with cold-war concepts like the \u201c GIUK gap\u201d, a maritime choke-point between Greenland, Iceland and Britain that is Russia\u2019s principal outlet to the Atlantic. Russia has also reoccupied seven former Soviet bases in the Arctic region and launched its first military icebreaker in 40 years. In turn, America has doubled the number of marines based in Norway, and on October 19th sent an aircraft-carrier into the Arctic Circle for the first time in almost 30 years.\n\nA third distinctive element of Trident Juncture was its size: 65 ships, 250 aircraft, 10,000 vehicles and 50,000 personnel. This was a test of NATO\u2019 s ability to pump reinforcements over the oceans, teeming with Russian submarines, and then across the continent. This has proven tricky. Lieutenant-General Ben Hodges, who retired as commander of American forces in Europe in December 2017, recalls his surprise at learning that Europe\u2019s Schengen area, which has abolished border controls, did not extend to the free movement of arms. Others point to problems with infrastructure, such as incompatible railway gauges and weak bridges.\n\nNATO\u2019 s response to the new threats has been the biggest overhaul of its command structure in a generation. Two new headquarters, one focused on the Atlantic, based in America, and another on logistics, in Germany, will be established over the next three years, adding 1,200 personnel. Generals are also getting chummy with Eurocrats. EU - NATO relations were once \u201ctrench warfare\u201d, says Sir Adam Thomson, Britain\u2019s envoy to NATO from 2014 to 2016. Now there is \u201cunprecedented practical collaboration\u201d. The EU published its own action plan on military mobility in March and sent the head of its military staff on a joint tour of Washington with his NATO counterpart last week.\n\nNATO\u2019 s renaissance should cheer fans of the beleaguered liberal order. In recent years the alliance has deployed four battlegroups (up to 1,400 troops each) to Poland and the Baltic states as tripwire forces; created a rapid-response brigade (about 5,000-strong) that can mobilise within two days; and committed to having 30 battalions, 30 warships and 30 air squadrons ready to fight at 30 days\u2019 notice. America is spending $6bn a year on its European Deterrence Initiative, lavished on everything from Hungarian air bases to exercises such as Trident Juncture. Russia\u2019s spree of invasion, intimidation and assassination has roused the alliance from its slumber.\n\nYet this military revival is accompanied by political malaise. For one thing, no one these days is quite sure whether the alliance\u2019s principal member would actually show up to fight in a crisis. The platoon of Montenegrin infantrymen at Trident Juncture, part of the Spanish battalion defending Oppdal, might reasonably have recalled President Donald Trump\u2019s scorn for their \u201cvery aggressive\u201d country during this year\u2019s NATO summit, and asked how it squared with the transatlantic spirit on display in the Norwegian hills.", "D IVA AMON , a researcher at the Natural History Museum in London, spotted her first whale skull in 2013, during an expedition to the Clarion Clipperton Zone ( CCZ ) in the tropical Pacific. It sat on beige silt, some 4,000 metres beneath the sea\u2019s surface, and was entirely covered in a black coating. Her find was twice notable. First, the skull\u2019s coating meant it was millions of years old, for it was made of the same slowly accumulating metallic oxides as the potato-like ore nodules that are drawing miners to the area. Second, the discovery highlighted how little is known about the deep ocean. Dr Amon\u2019s whale skull, and others like it, raise questions about the trade-offs between the economic gains of mining the seabed and that mining\u2019s environmental consequences.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose involved in deep-sea mining hope it will turn into a multi-billion dollar industry. Seabed nodules are dominated by compounds of iron (which is commonplace) and manganese (which is rarer, but not in short supply from mines on dry land). However, the nodules also contain copper, nickel and cobalt, and sometimes other metals such as molybdenum and vanadium. These are in sufficient demand that visiting the bottom of the ocean to acquire them looks a worthwhile enterprise. Moreover, these metals seldom co-occur in terrestrial mines. So, as Kris Van Nijen, who runs deep-sea mining operations at Global Sea Mineral Resources ( GSR ), a company interested in exploiting the nodules, observes: \u201cFor the same amount of effort, you get the same metals as two or three mines on land.\u201d\n\nHades\u2019 hall\n\nThough their location several kilometres beneath the ocean surface makes the nodules hard to get at in one sense, in another they are easily accessible, because they sit invitingly on the seabed, almost begging to be collected. Most are found on parts of the ocean floor like the CCZ , outside the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones of littoral countries. They thus fall under the purview of the International Seabed Authority ( ISA ), which has issued 17 exploration licences for such resources. All but one of these licences pertain to the CCZ , an area of about 6m square kilometres east-south-east of Hawaii.\n\nThe licensees include Belgium, Britain, China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Russia, Singapore and South Korea, as well as several small Pacific island states. America, which is not party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea that established the ISA , is not involved directly, but at least one American firm, Lockheed Martin, has an interest in the matter through a British subsidiary, UK Seabed Resources. And people are getting busy. Surveying expeditions have already visited the concessions. On land, the required mining machines are being built and tested. What worries biologists is that if all this busyness does lead to mining, it will wreck habitats before they can be properly catalogued, let alone understood.\n\nThe first task, therefore, is to establish what exactly lives down there. At first glance, the CCZ \u2019s abyssal plain does not look of much interest. It is a vast expanse of mud, albeit littered with nodules. But, though life here may not be abundant, it is diverse. Craig Smith, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, who studies the ocean\u2019s abyssal plain, says that the CCZ contains a greater variety of species than the deep seas off the coasts of California and Hawaii.\n\nSome of the CCZ \u2019s creatures stretch the imagination. There is the bizarre, gelatinous, yellow \u201cgummy squirrel\u201d (pictured), a 50cm-long sea cucumber with a tall, wide tail that may operate like a sail. There are galloping sea urchins that can scurry across the sea floor on long spines, at speeds of several centimetres a second. There are giant red shrimps, measuring up to 40cm long. And there are \u201cDumbo\u201d octopuses, which have earlike fins above their eyes, giving them an eerie resemblance to a well-known cartoon elephant.\n\nEvery expedition brings up species that are new to science, many of them belonging to biological families that are also novel. At a conference in Monterey, California, in September, Dr Smith presented results of a biodiversity survey carried out in the British concession, which sits at the eastern end of the CCZ . Of 154 species of bristle worms the surveyors found, 70% were previously unknown. Dr Smith says the concession may be part of a biodiversity hotspot, one which would not be represented in the nine protected areas of environmental interest that have been set aside in the CCZ . He therefore argues for the establishment of a tenth such area, on the margins of the concession.\n\nA whale of a tale\n\nThe ocean\u2019s largest inhabitants may also be visitors to the CCZ . This summer Leigh Marsh of Britain\u2019s National Oceanography Centre, in Southampton, described more than 3,000 large depressions in the mud there. These formed a series of curved tracks. Similar tracks elsewhere have been linked to whales scraping themselves against the seafloor. Dr Marsh and her colleagues suggest that deep-diving whales may be foraging on the CCZ seafloor, using it as a giant loofah to scrape parasites from their skins or even ingesting the nodules as ballast. If true, this would significantly extend the depth to which whales are known to dive.\n\nThe only direct evidence of whales in the CCZ , though, comes in fossil form. In Monterey, Dr Amon set the audience buzzing when she presented preliminary data suggesting that the region contains large deposits of fossil whale bones. Such fossils were first noted by the Challenger expedition, a world-spanning investigation of the deep ocean conducted in the 1870s by a British naval research vessel. Dr Amon\u2019s find back in 2013 prompted her and her colleagues to go through tens of thousands of images gathered by various exploration submarines. These recorded 548 cetacean fossils from a range of species. Among the oldest was Choneziphius, an extinct animal that lived more than 10m years ago.\n\nAlthough this work was a study of photographs, rather than of the remains directly, which could cast doubt over some of the identifications, the metallic-oxide coating of many of the bones gives a sense of how old they are. Because of the density of fossils, Dr Amon says the CCZ may be a previously undiscovered, and rare, submarine fossil bed.\n\nWhy whale fossils would accumulate in this particular spot is unknown. Possibly, those elsewhere are simply buried. The CCZ sits beneath the ocean\u2019s clearest waters, so its sediments accumulate extremely slowly. But it may be that some as-yet-unknown physical process is keeping the fossils and the (equally old) nodules at the surface of the silt. Indeed, why the nodules are exposed is one of the great mysteries of the region. Regardless, Dr Smith, Dr Amon and others hope the bones\u2019 presence will be taken into account as the ISA drafts the rules and regulations for exploitation of the CCZ .\n\nWhale fossils, sea cucumbers and shrimps are just the stuff that is visible to the naked eye. Adrian Glover, one of Dr Amon\u2019s colleagues at the Natural History Museum, and his collaborators spent weeks peering down microscopes, inspecting every nook and cranny of the surfaces of some of the nodules themselves. They discovered a miniature ecosystem composed of things that look, at first sight, like flecks of colour\u2014but are, in fact, tiny corals, sponges, fan-like worms and bryozoans, all just millimetres tall. In total, the team logged 77 species of such creatures, probably an underestimate.\n\nOut of sight. Out of mind?\n\nInevitably, much of this life will be damaged by nodule mining. The impacts are likely be long-lasting. Deep-sea mining technology is still in development, but the general idea is that submersible craft equipped with giant vacuum cleaners will suck nodules from the seafloor. Those nodules will be carried up several kilometres of pipes back to the operations\u2019 mother ships, to be washed and sent on their way.\n\nThe size and power of the submersibles means that they will leave large tracks in their wake. These are likely to persist for a long time. Evidence for this comes from various decades-old disturbance experiments. In 2015 an exploratory expedition by IFREMER , a French government agency responsible for oceanography, noted that even mobile animals like sea urchins were 70% less abundant within 37-year-old experimental tracks than outside them.\n\nThe largest disturbance experiment so far was carried out in 1989 in the Peru Basin, a nodule field to the south of the Galapagos Islands. An eight-metre-wide metal frame fitted with ploughs and harrows was dragged back and forth repeatedly across the seabed, scouring it and wafting a plume of sediment into the water. In 2015 a research vessel returned to the site. Down went the robots, samplers and submarines with their scanners and cameras. The big question was, 26 years after the event, would the sea floor have recovered? The answer was a resounding \u201cno\u201d. The robots brought back images of plough tracks that looked fresh, and of wildlife that had not recovered from the decades-old intrusion.\n\nAnother concern, in the wake of the Peru Basin experiment, is sediment. This will be both stirred up during collection, as the robots crawl across the sea floor and hoover it, and washed off the nodules at the surface when they are cleaned. Ideally, a second pipe would deliver those washings directly back to the seabed, in order to keep disruption in the water column to a minimum. In practice, dumping silt overboard will be much easier. Decades of failure to police overfishing demonstrate how hard it is to regulate activity on the high seas.\n\nIf silt were dumped in this way it could be disastrous. A steady stream of the stuff raining down from the surface would affect everything along the way, especially filter-feeding animals such as sponges and krill, which make their livings by extracting small particles of food floating in the water. The effect both in the water column and on the sea floor might not be so great in other parts of the oceans, say biologists, but life in the crystalline CCZ is wholly unadapted to murky waters.\n\nAll of this needs to be balanced against the impacts of mining the equivalent amounts of minerals on land, however. The CCZ covers about 2% of the deep ocean. A 20-year operation within it would affect of the order of 10,000 square kilometres\u2014about a six-hundredth of its area\u2014according to Mr Van Nijen. And, unlike mining developments in virgin areas of dry land, which tend to bring other forms of development in their wake by creating transport links that encourage human settlement, no one is going to follow the nodule-hoovers and actually live on the abyssal plain.\n\nIn the end, the only way to measure how mining would change the bottom of the ocean may be to conduct small-scale pilot operations. The first will take place next April, when GSR will lower Patania II, an enormous green tractor, to the bed of the CCZ . Patania II is a prototype nodule collector. It will clear areas roughly 300 by 100 metres, leaving them nodule-free, so that future expeditions can return and study recolonisation rates. An array of sensors suspended in the nearby water will monitor the resultant silt plume, which the company\u2019s models suggest could travel up to 5km\u2014not the hundreds of kilometres that some have suggested.", "IN VIETNAM, Kate Brooks is posing as a tourist looking to buy wildlife products. On the dealer\u2019s counter there is a poster featuring a cartoon of a baby rhino, part of a campaign to spread awareness about the animals\u2019 looming extinction. Oblivious to the irony, the salesman presents pictures of his rhino-horn bracelets on his phone, placing the device atop the poster.\n\nIt is one of many shocking moments in \u201cThe Last Animals\u201d, an urgent and beautifully shot film about the world\u2019s largest land mammals and the people fighting to prevent their extinction. During its making, 100,000 elephants and 5,000 rhinos were killed for their tusks and horns, used in ornaments, jewellery and traditional medicines. The problem is not new and this documentary is not the first to highlight it, but Ms Brooks\u2019s five years of work, uncovering the lesser-known sides of the story, has resulted in an impressive and far-reaching film.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Brooks, a photojournalist turned film-maker, previously worked in the Middle East and is no stranger to conflict zones. She makes clear that the frontline in the fight to protect endangered animals is no different to any other. Poachers\u2014funded by criminal networks, enabled by corrupt politicians and often linked to terrorist organisations\u2014are now armed with automatic weapons, night-vision goggles and helicopters. After drugs, weapons and human trafficking, it is the fourth most lucrative transnational crime.\n\n\u201cThe Last Animals\u201d is an ode to the \u201cunsung heroes\u201d who every day risk, and frequently lose, their lives protecting animals. Early on, it shows a Congolese community in mourning for a ranger. His colleagues must put their grief aside to continue their training, led by Jacques Lusengo, a colonel in the armed forces, and Patrick Duboscq, a French ex-policeman who laments their shoddy equipment. They are later ambushed while on patrol in Garamba National Park, leading to a shoot-out; the footage of poachers riddled with bullets, one of them dying on camera, is horrific to watch. Later the viewer learns that the rangers\u2019 helicopter was gunned down, killing the colonel and three of his team. It is hard to reconcile these tragic deaths, both animal and human, with the demand for trinkets and ineffectual potions.\n\nIndeed, despite official estimates that elephants and rhinos may become extinct in the next ten to 20 years, Ms Brooks says \u201cthe reality is that localised extinction is happening now\u201d. At the start of filming, there were seven northern white rhinos left in the world but this figure quickly decreased to five. In zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic, and in Ol Pejeta conservancy in Kenya, the animals are named individuals, making it all the more shocking when they die\u2014Nola, Nabire, then Sudan, the last male, until there are only two. They die of various natural causes while in captivity; interventions to make them breed have failed. According to Ms Brooks, it is a cautionary tale of what happens when humans try too little too late. There is nothing left to do but watch an extinction taking place.\n\nYet there are some glimmers of hope in \u201cThe Last Animals\u201d. Scientists hope to be able to create a northern white rhino using stem-cell and in-vitro fertilisation technology. Gene mapping can trace ivory\u2019s origins, revealing poaching hotspots and the paths of criminal networks. Conservationists and international activists are making progress in changing attitudes and legislation. Further campaigning is needed, Ms Brooks says, given the scale of the problem. She asks her audience to petition to stop the legal trade of ivory and rhino horn (as people cannot differentiate between antique, farmed or poached animal products without impractical and costly tests). The film\u2019s website provides a portal to do so.\n\nIt is a dire situation, and worsening. On October 29th China partially reversed a ban to allow sales of rhino products and tiger bones in \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d. Countries including Australia, Canada and New Zealand are yet to implement comprehensive bans; ivory continues to be sold in 41 states in America. The EU is one of the largest exporters of legal ivory in the world. A recent report from the WWF says that population sizes of wildlife decreased by 60% globally between 1970 and 2014. It lends an extra weight to the closing lines of the film: \u201cif we don\u2019t stop the killing, it will eventually be just us humans as the last animals\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Last Animals\u201d is available to view in Australia, Canada, Ireland and Britain through Amazon, iTunes and other on-demand platforms. It will be coming to America and other countries soon.", "AFTER TWO years of unified Republican control, divided government is returning to Washington. In arguably the most consequential mid-term elections in recent memory, the Democratic Party won a comfortable majority in America\u2019s House of Representatives. Although the exact tallies have not yet been finalised, the Democrats needed 218 seats to wrest back the speakership, and are expected to end up with around 230. Their victory puts an end to President Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of enacting further conservative legislation during the second half of his term. It also sets the stage for a whirlwind of Congressional investigations into Mr Trump\u2019s business dealings, his cabinet\u2019s management of federal agencies and alleged collusion between his presidential-campaign staff and Russian operatives. The Democratic majority could also initiate impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump, although that would be unwise given that the Senate would not follow suit. Nancy Pelosi (pictured left), the party\u2019s leader in the lower house, has ruled out an effort to impeach the president for now.\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, it was the Republicans who were cheering, as they will expand their current 51-49 majority in the Senate by anywhere from two to four seats. The mix of Senate contests this year strongly favoured the party: of the 35 seats up for election, just nine were held by Republicans, and five incumbent Democrats were on the ballot in states Mr Trump won by double digits in 2016. Still, the Democrats hoped that their large advantage in overall popularity this year might enable these vulnerable senators to hold on, and polls suggested that only one of them faced a clear deficit.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, however, there was too much Republican DNA in many of these states for Democratic candidates to overcome. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri were all defeated. Florida also continued to favour Republicans, as Rick Scott, the current Republican governor, beat the incumbent senator, Bill Nelson, by less than one percentage point. With extra breathing room in the Senate, Mr Trump will probably be able to win confirmation of his nominees if he decides to replace members of his cabinet, or if another Supreme Court seat becomes vacant. The Republican victories will also make it extremely difficult for the Democrats to retake the Senate in 2020, leaving them with little hope of implementing campaign promises even if they were to win back the presidency.\n\nIn close races for state governors, the elections rendered a split decision. Democrats were disappointed in Florida and Georgia, where the party nominated overtly progressive black candidates to run against populist, white conservatives whom Mr Trump backed in the Republican primaries. The Florida race has already been called for the Republican, and in Georgia, the Republican candidate has 51% of the vote. However, the Democrats did claim a prize scalp in Wisconsin, where a batch of late-counted absentee ballots put the two-term incumbent Scott Walker at a one-percentage-point disadvantage. They also defeated Kris Kobach, an anti-immigration hard-liner close to Mr Trump, in deep-red Kansas, and won the governorship of Nevada. And by larger margins, they picked up the governors\u2019 mansions in Michigan, New Mexico and Maine. Combined with their gains in state legislatures, the Democrats added \u201ctrifectas\u201d\u2014meaning control of the governorship and both chambers of the legislature\u2014in New York, Illinois, New Mexico, Colorado, Maine and Nevada, and ended Republican ones in Michigan, New Hampshire, Kansas and Wisconsin.\n\nBeyond the achievement of recapturing the House, the best news for Democrats was probably the results in state-level ballot initiatives. Missouri, Michigan and Colorado approved referenda delegating the drawing of legislative districts to non-partisan commissions, and voters in Florida met the 60% threshold to pass an initiative that restored the right to vote for felons who have completed their prison sentences. Idaho and Nebraska also voted to participate in the expansion of Medicaid, the federal health-care programme for people under 65, that was a centrepiece of former President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care reform. Montana and Utah may do so as well.\n\nDemocrats have been eagerly anticipating this year\u2019s midterms since the day they lost the presidential election of 2016. When compared with the sweeping victories for the opposition party in 2006, 2010 and 2014, the party\u2019s loss of Senate seats and defeats in a few tight gubernatorial races may leave its loyalists feeling disappointed. However, a year ago betting markets only gave the opposition a 50/50 chance of re-taking the lower chamber. The Democrats\u2019 share of all votes cast for the House is expected to be as large or larger than in previous wave elections. The Republican monopoly on federal power is about to end, and Congressional oversight of the executive branch will return with a vengeance.\n\nSee also:\n\n2018 mid-term elections results"]
