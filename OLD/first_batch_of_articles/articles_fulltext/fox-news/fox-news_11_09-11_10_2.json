They'd planned to visit Ainse-Marne American Cemetery in Belleau, France.

Millard. \"By conducting a thorough review and investigation, we hope to provide answers to the families of brave Airmen that lost their lives and prevent future occurrences and tragedies.\"\n\nMillard's team spent close to a month reviewing an array of evidence including interviews, logs, video, briefing materials, and inspection of aircraft wreckage before assembling a detailed sequence of events surrounding the crash.\n\nAccording to the report, the left outermost engine experienced problems and investigators found that the crew's mismanagement of the malfunction deviated from standard procedures. Failure to follow those procedures made further action by the pilot result in loss of control of the aircraft, causing it to crash.\n\nThe plane was assigned to a crew from the 156th Airlift Wing in Muniz Air Base from Puerto Rico. Their mission was to deliver the C-130 plane from Savannah to an Air Force base in Arizona commonly referred to as the \"Boneyard\", where it would be decommissioned.\n\nThe pilot of the plane was previously identified as Maj.

It is an overwhelming defeat for an industry already in decline, with 50 tracks closing nationally over the past 30 years because of shrinking crowds and accusations that dogs are mistreated.\n\nAdvocates for the ban say many of Florida's 8,000 racing dogs will now likely be adopted, as usually happens when they leave the sport, though some may be transferred to other states where the sport will remain legal.\n\nDOG IN MISSOURI RECEIVES LIFESAVING KIDNEY FROM ONE OF HER \u2018HERO\u2019 PUPPIES, FAMILY SAYS\n\nFlorida's 11 dog tracks constitute almost two-thirds of those remaining nationally. When they close, the sport may be too small to survive long term. Two tracks remain in West Virginia and one each in Alabama, Arkansas and Iowa. In Texas, three tracks rotate an annual meet.\n\nCarey Theil, executive director of Grey2K USA, one of the groups pushing for a nationwide ban, called the margin \"astounding\" and said it was one of the largest ever nationally for any animal rights measure. Amendment 13 even got majorities in 10 of the 11 counties where racing is held \u2014 in five of those, support exceeded 70 percent.\n\n\"It's a powerful endorsement of our humane values, and a repudiation of an industry that is cruel and inhumane,\" Theil said Wednesday. He said the state should provide resources for any workers who lose jobs because of the ban, including retraining.\n\nJim Gartland, executive director of the National Greyhound Association, said he was surprised by the amendment's passage \u2014 it needed 60 percent, under Florida law. He said hundreds of greyhound breeders and their employees nationally will be hurt by the Florida decision, and accused the amendment's backers of \"lying\" and giving \"misleading facts and figures\" when they said dogs are abused. State records show that, on average, two of the state's racing dogs die of injury or illness weekly.\n\n\"It makes no sense that people who make their livelihoods from dogs would abuse them,\" Gartland said. Abused dogs are slow dogs, he said, and trainers make their living by producing winners. He said it is unclear how many Florida tracks will keep live racing through 2020 and how many will drop the sport sooner.\n\nNYPD SALUTES K-9 AS SHE LOSES BATTLE WITH CANCER\n\nJack Cory, spokesman for the Florida Greyhound Association, said tracks and trainers will go to the Legislature and, if necessary, to the courts to be compensated for the revenue they will lose.\n\nBackers spent more than $3 million getting the measure adopted \u2014 10 times the amount spent by racing supporters. Almost half the backers' funding came from a $1.5 million donation by the Doris Day Animal League, a national group founded by the 96-year-old actress.\n\nThe anti-racing movement had support from across the political spectrum, from animal rights groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to Republican Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nAmendment 13's opponents included the National Rifle Association's state affiliate, which thinks the measure's language saying \"the humane treatment of animals is a fundamental value\" of Floridians could be a backdoor way to eventually ban hunting and fishing. The state Supreme Court rejected that argument during the opponents' failed effort to remove the amendment from the ballot.\n\nFor some tracks, losing live racing might actually increase profits. Under current Florida law, greyhound tracks must offer live racing to operate poker rooms and accept wagers on simulcast horse racing from tracks across the country. Amendment 13 allows them to keep those side businesses without live racing, even if they drop it immediately.\n\nThe amount wagered on greyhound racing in Florida decreased from $1.5 billion in 1992, adjusted for inflation, to just over $200 million in 2017, state records show. After paying bettors, purses and taxes, five tracks reported losses on live greyhound racing last year and the then-12 tracks combined net revenue on live racing was $20 million. That's about a fifth their poker net.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nJim O'Brien, president and CEO of Melbourne Greyhound Park, said his small track near the Kennedy Space Center loses about $250,000 annually on live racing, but he feels loyalty to the trainers who run dogs there. So he said he wants to take a few days to decide whether to run the track's upcoming meet. The track made $5 million last year on poker.\n\n\"We are probably going to run, but we will see,\" he said.", "Florida\u2019s secretary of state announced Saturday that there will be recounts in the Senate and gubernatorial races after the races became tight enough to trigger them -- amid controversy over the handling of the counts, with President Trump warning that he will be \"watching closely.\"\n\nSecretary Ken Detzner issued the order after the unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount. The results of the machine recount will be due by 3 p.m. ET this coming Thursday. The votes in the Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, and the gubernatorial race between Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis and Democratic mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum, will be recounted. There will also be a recount for the race for agriculture commissioner.\n\nElection officials in Miami-Dade County said they launched a \"machine recount\" Saturday evening, meaning they were loading paper ballots into scanning machines. The processing of some 800,000 ballots could take several days, the Associated Press reported.\n\nEarlier Saturday, 266 stray ballots from a mail sorting facility in Opa-locka arrived at Miami-Dade's Elections Department, a spokeswoman for the department told the Miami Herald on Saturday evening. But the Opa-locka ballots won't be counted because Florida law says that mail-in ballots can be counted only if they arrive by the time that polls close on Election Day, the newspaper reported.\n\nMiami-Dade had received some 15,000 mail ballots Tuesday while conventional voters were at the polls, the report said.\n\nOn Saturday morning, a group of protesters outside the Miami-Dade agency's offices demanded that all ballots be counted, regardless of when they were received, the Herald reported.\n\nIn Florida, a mandatory recount occurs if the winning candidate\u2019s margin is less than 0.5 percent. If the margin is less than 0.25 percent, the recount must be done by hand.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: AS DEMOCRATS TRY TO STEAL ELECTIONS, THEIR DISHONESTY THREATENS THE VERY FABRIC OF OUR COUNTRY\n\nBoth Scott and DeSantis led their races after the midterms on Tuesday, with Gillum conceding to DeSantis. But as the days went on, and more votes were counted, those leads have all but disappeared.\n\nScott\u2019s lead by Saturday afternoon was reduced to 0.15 percent and DeSantis\u2019 was 0.41 percent.\n\nThe shrinking leads quickly led to suspicions from Republicans that foul play was afoot in Democratic strongholds of Broward and Palm Beach counties. Democrats, meanwhile, have accused Republicans of trying to stop all votes from being counted. President Trump on Saturday told reporters that \u201cthey are finding votes out of nowhere.\u201d\n\n\"What's going on in Florida is a disgrace,\" he said.\n\nHe reacted within moments to the announcement of the recounts by accusing Democrats of \"trying to steal two big elections in Florida!\"\n\n\"We are watching closely!\" he added.\n\nScott had asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the counties\u2019 election departments, but a spokeswoman told the Associated Press there would be no investigation as there was no credible allegation of fraud.\n\nGillum welcomed the recount in a news conference on Saturday.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concessions with an uncompromising and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\" he told reporters. He also called for calm, and said he was prepared to accept \"whatever the outcome of this election so far as every single vote...is counted.\"\n\nScott took to Twitter on Saturday evening, revealing that \"7,500 volunteer recount representatives\" were at the ready in Florida.\n\n\"Reps will be deployed all over FL to make sure any potential issues are reported so they can be quickly reviewed and resolved,\" he tweeted. \"We won't allow unethical liberals to steal this election!\"\n\nIn a sign of the turmoil that could ensue, protesters gathered outside the Broward elections office ahead of the announcement. Broward in particular has long been the source of election controversies. In 2016, Republican poll watchers complained that staff was opening absentee ballots in private, thereby making it impossible for groups to question whether ballots were cast, according to Politico. The GOP sued in 2017 to make sure Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes followed the law.\n\nBALLOT MIXUP PUTS MORE HEAT ON BROWARD ELECTIONS OFFICIAL AS KEY FLORIDA RACES REMAIN UNRESOLVED\n\nOn Friday, the Miami Herald reported that there were invalid ballots mixed in with about 200 valid ones, but not solution was immediately found for the problem.\n\nFox News' Elizabeth Zwirz and Dom Calicchio and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nAfter French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe needs to defend itself from the United States, aides said he was misunderstood.\n\nBut the idea isn't so far-fetched.\n\nMacron is leading a rearguard action to salvage the system of international cooperation the U.S. helped build, but which President Donald Trump has chipped away at since taking office.\n\nWhile Trump came all the way to Paris for commemorations marking 100 years since the armistice that ended World War I, he's skipping an international peace forum that Macron is launching Sunday.\n\nThe forum is part of Macron's efforts to defend the idea that nations need to work together instead of at each other's expense. But without the leader of the world's only remaining superpower, the forum will lose some of its sense.\n\nEurope feels deeply threatened, meanwhile, by Trump's declared plan to pull the U.S. out a nuclear treaty with Russia that Europeans see as a cornerstone of post-Cold War peace and their own security. The U.S. says Russia is violating it anyway.\n\nThe tension overshadowed the two presidents' latest meeting Saturday at the French presidential palace. A French official present at the meeting said Macron made the point that in making decisions about treaties like the one Trump said he would abandon, the U.S. \"should not forget something under your nose, which is European allies.\"\n\nMost Americans have never heard of the treaty that's being scrapped, but it has a clear meaning for European policymakers. The 1987 Intermediary-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty grew out of years of friction over a Soviet nuclear buildup and a threatened retaliatory U.S. missile deployment in Europe.\n\nMacron has warned that if the treaty is scrapped and Russia resumes building the kind of missiles it banned, the weapons could easily reach European targets \u2014 but not the U.S.\n\nAnother sore point for Macron and Trump: the question of a joint European army, which Macron has championed but which could overlap with the U.S.-led NATO alliance.\n\nMacron said in an interview this week with Europe-1 radio that when it comes to the cyber-sphere and the threat to pull out of nuclear treaties, \"We should protect ourselves when it comes to China, Russia and even the United States.\"\n\nLater in the interview, the French leader talked about a European army. Trump lumped the two topics together and tweeted as Air Force One landed in Paris on Friday night that it was \"insulting\" Macron wanted an army to defend Europe from the U.S.\n\nTrump's tweet was especially wounding to Macron, one of the strongest U.S. allies in Europe.\n\nThe idea that Macron would see the United States as an adversary \"is totally against our alliance and our 250-year history. France and the U.S. have been side by side,\" another French official said, evoking World War I battlefields where U.S. and French soldiers fought on the same side and the nations' joint operation against Syria earlier this year.\n\nWhen Macron first took power, he expressed hope that he might be able to have a restraining influence on Trump, then newly elected like him.\n\nBut by pulling the United States out of a climate-change deal signed in Paris and other international deals that France embraces \u2014 and now, with his undiplomatic tweet before meeting Macron \u2014 Trump has made clear that the French leader is not holding the reins.\n\nMacron and his aides scrambled Saturday to clarify what the president views as the threats Europe faces today. Among them: Russia's political meddling and military buildup, as well as a sense that Trump is abandoning U.S. commitments to European allies.\n\nMacron pointed out that he pledged to boost France's military spending even before Trump upbraided NATO members last year for not paying enough for their own defense.\n\nThe tense exchange with Trump is just the latest challenge for Macron, who was seen as a bulwark against rising European nationalism when he was elected a year ago.\n\nThe pro-business, pro-EU president is increasingly weakened domestically for unpopular economic policies and isolated in Europe, where nationalist groups have gained ground.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

The mom was dehydrated and malnourished, local news station Fox 2 reported.\n\nWhen Star and her puppies were taken to Murphy Animal Hospital in High Ridge, veterinarians there determined she was in advanced kidney failure -- a near-death experience Star somehow managed to survive. She was then adopted by the owner of the animal hospital, Shannon Flegle, and many of her puppies went to homes in the St. Louis area.\n\nTHIS PENNSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY IS GETTING A PET-FRIENDLY DORM\n\nBut over the summer, Star began to vomit and refused to eat. The dog\u2019s condition continued to worsen, and tests later showed Star\u2019s kidneys were again in failure.\n\nIn order to save Star\u2019s life, veterinarians determined the dog would need a kidney transplant -- which could only be performed if the dog could find the perfect match, much like in humans.\n\nThat\u2019s when Elsa, one of Star\u2019s puppies found in the box a few years ago, came to the rescue.\n\n\"It just really seemed like she picked us at the time,\" Jenny Murray, Elsa\u2019s owner, told the news station.\n\nAfter consulting with her husband and children, the family decided to see if Elsa would be a match for Star.\n\nTENNESSEE MAN SAVES PUPPY ALLEGEDLY ATTACKED BY HAWK: \u2018HE ALMOST BLED OUT\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is Elsa\u2019s chance to save her mom, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh so she\u2019s a hero!\u2019\u201d Murray told Fox 2 of her children\u2019s reaction.\n\nElsa was a match and the two dogs underwent a successful surgery, which was performed by a veterinarian in Wisconsin, in October.\n\nBoth pups are on the mend and are \u201cexpected to live normal lives\u201d going forward, Fox 2 reported.", "With Democrats set to take control of the House in January after their midterm victory this week, the question now turns to who will take the speaker\u2019s gavel -- and if any of the rank-and-file will put their name forward to oppose House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPelosi, D-Calif., said this week that she was confident that she would be speaker again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone deserves anything. It\u2019s not about what you have done, it\u2019s what you can do. What you\u2019ve done in the past speaks to your credentials, but it\u2019s about what you can do, and I think I\u2019m the best person to go forward, to unify, to negotiate,\u201d she said.\n\nPELOSI BRUSHES OFF RANK-AND-FILE RUMBLINGS AS SHE EYE'S SPEAKER'S GAVEL: 'I'M A GOOD NEGOTIATOR'\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a good negotiator, as anyone can see in terms of how we\u2019ve won every negotiation so far,\u201d she added.\n\nBut there have been long-standing fears among some Democrats that Pelosi hurts House Democrats in some competitive races, and could also be holding back its next generation of leaders. Republicans, certainly, see a Pelosi speakership as beneficial to them. President Trump last week said that Republicans would help Pelosi if she didn\u2019t have enough support from Democrats.

That number could be lower if not all members vote.\n\nThe pledges suggest Pelosi has an uphill climb, one that she could overcome with persuasive arguments or some good committee assignments. But those who have said they would vote against Pelosi could face political heat if they break that promise. The Republican National Committee has said it will be watching for which Democrats change their tune on voting for Pelosi.\n\nBut for Pelosi to be opposed, opponents need a viable alternative candidate, and so far that isn\u2019t happening -- although one still has time to emerge.\n\n\u201cIt actually would help if somebody would challenge her,\u201d a former House leadership aide told The Hill.\n\nAn opponent \u201cwould be good for her and make her stronger coming out of the internal race rather than her being anointed Speaker,\u201d a House Democratic chief of staff told the outlet. \u201cIt would put progressives at bay and help give moderates some cover.

Ambassador Hau Do Suan told Fox News in a recent interview. \u201cThey attacked against the government in Rakhine State in October 2016 and again in August 2017. This humanitarian problem was ignited by those terrorist attacks.\u201d\n\nThat explanation has been dismissed by many Western countries and human rights groups, some of whom now believe a repatriation effort to return Rohingya who had fled to neighboring Bangladesh in the face of ethnic cleansing - perhaps even genocide - is a potentially disastrous recipe for further persecution.\n\nUN RIGHTS RESOLUTION WOULD CONDEMN ABUSES AGAINST ROHINGYAS\n\nThe Rohingya have \u201creceived no assurance of their physical safety,\" said Kristina Arriaga, vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), who warned against members of the group returning to Burma, given there \u201chave been no guarantees of protection for their properties, livelihoods or basic human rights, including religious freedom.\u201d\n\nUSCIRF has called on the U.S. State Department to continue imposing sanctions \u2013 many of which were rolled back by the Obama administration \u2013 targeting specific \u201cabusers\u201d in the Burmese military, as well as non-state actors.\n\nSuan argues the country's \"Bengali Muslim population problem\u201d has been going on since the country achieved its independence from Britain in 1948. He insisted security forces have been responding to a well-founded threat from such Rohingya militants, who attacked police posts in Rakhine state, rather than methodically targeting local people.\n\nHe called charges of ethnic cleansing \u201ctotally insane,\u201d and stressed his government is advocating a \u201cpeaceful and voluntary return of the refugees back to their place.\u201d\n\nSuan has condemned the U.N. for only listening to \u201cone side\u201d of the story, and not recognizing the injustices undertaken by ARSA. He also asserted that in the wake of the \u201cterrorist attacks,\u201d all peace efforts already in-motion were subsequently \u201champered.\u201d\n\nBut the likes of Amnesty International has turned up troves of evidence of an \u201corchestrated campaign\u201d of systematic abuses by security forces. Amnesty has also acknowledged a Rohingya armed group wielding guns and swords \u2013 known indeed as ARSA \u2013 is responsible for at least one, or potentially two, massacres of up to 99 Hindu women, men and children, in addition to \u201cunlawful killings and abductions of Hindu villagers\u201d in Rakhine State, beginning in August 2017.\n\n\u201cAccountability for these atrocities is every bit as crucial as it is for the crimes against humanity carried out by Myanmar\u2019s security forces,\u201d said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty\u2019s Crisis Response Director.\n\nThough the Rohingya have lived in Burma for generations, they are denied citizenship, and not even recognized as an ethnic minority. Rather, officials refer to them as Suan did - the \u201cBengali Muslim population.\u201d\n\nBANGLADESH RESCUES ROHINGYA ILLEGALLY HEADING FOR MALAYSIA\n\nSuan argued the Muslims in Rakhine state were brought in by the British colony in the late 19th Century, to farm the area. A second wave came in 1971 and 1972, when then-East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, fought Pakistan for its independence, said Suan. \u201cSo these people they call Rohingya people are Bengali stock, and speak the Bengali language,\u201d he claimed.\n\nThe ambassador also claimed the \u201cinvented\" Rohingya name \"is not recognized by anyone,\u201d and was created only to \u201cattract the support and attention of the Muslim world.\u201d But the U.N. is among those who in fact do recognize the Rohingya, seen now as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. The Rohingya are victims of beatings, rape, and systematic slaughter, according to human rights groups.\n\nSince August of last year, an estimated 10,000 Rohingya are reported to have been murdered, according to the Doctors Without Borders group. And among those victims were 730 children under the age of five.\n\nMore than 100,000 Rohingya homes are also reported to have been burned to the ground. And at least 750,000 people, according to Amnesty International, have been forced over the border to Bangladesh. More than 200,000 Rohingya were already displaced in the bordering country, having been in camps for years out of fear to return.\n\nA report released in July by advocacy group Fortify Rights alleged the flight of some 700,000 Rohingya was sparked by a planned campaign of large-scale slaughter, rape and village burnings in Rakhine.

In June, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years behind bars for \u201cbreaching the country\u2019s official secrets act\u201d after being accused of obtaining classified documents. Their trial was largely viewed as a sham by the international community.\n\nBut on Friday, in a rare case of good news, the incitement case against three other journalists was withdrawn. Eleven Media editors Kyaw Zaw Lin and Nayi Min, and chief reporter Phyo Wai Win, who were arrested in October but allowed out on bail, were cleared - at least for now. They were accused after an article raised questions about government minister Phyo Min Thein, a close confidant of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nThe government is also accused of targeting other non-Buddhist religious minorities, including those in the Christian community. Violence has risen as well in the Christian Kachin community, with horrific tales of church burnings, mass killings, and persecution.\n\nSuan attempted an explanation for that issue as well.\n\n\u201cKachin people rose against the central government from 1962. The government at that time announced Buddhism as the state religion, and they did not accept this policy,\" he said. \"Since then, they have been fighting the government.\u201d\n\nHe dismissed any notion government forces were the aggressors. \u201cThese things have been going on for so many years, but there is no business for religious discrimination. This is not logical.\u201d\n\nA statement provided to Fox News by Myanmar\u2019s Washington Embassy also said \u201cnational reconciliation and achieving peace are the priorities of the current civilian government,\u201d and claimed the government is \u201cready to address issues related to human rights violations in all parts of the country that come up with concrete evidence.\u201d\n\nBut the United States and human rights groups have been very reluctant to accept the government's account of what's happening with the religious minorities.\n\nWhen Burma was under a complete military rule, the U.S. and most other Western governments heavily sanctioned the regime.

Her post last month, in which she said she killed a wild goat on Scotland\u2019s Isle of Islay with a \u201cperfect 200 yard shot\u201d, prompted the country\u2019s government to announce that it would conduct a review into how it regulates hunting.\n\n\"I will never apologize for being a hunter and I definitely don\u2019t regret posting my hunting photos online,\" Switlyk told Fox News. \"People do not need to follow me on social media if they don\u2019t want to see them. It\u2019s really that simple.\n\n\"It\u2019s also immensely satisfying and a privilege to get your food this way,\" she added. \"Whether this gets your goat or not, you are certainly entitled to your opinion. Even though violence and name-calling seems to be the way our society is going, it\u2019s not the way I choose to hold a discussion.\"\n\nSome Twitter users responded to similar remarks she recently made on Twitter by urging her not to come back to Scotland ever again.\n\n\u201cIt won't hurt your feelings because you don't have any,\u201d one said. \u201cYou are a classic psychopath.\u201d\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson told Fox News that its review of Switlyk\u2019s images and others like it, which according to its leader will \u201cconsider whether changes to the law are required\u201d \u2013 is still ongoing, and there is no timetable for its completion.\n\nSwitlyk, following the Scotland hunt, has launched a T-shirt line with phrases like \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Get Your Goat\u201d and \u201cBarbaric Hunter\u201d and claims that a portion of proceeds will go towards conservation efforts for Capra species, which include wild goats.\n\n\"When I got back on the grid I was in shocked at how out of hand just posting a photo on social media got,\" she told Fox News. \"They had advertised my address and while I was gone, people showed up at my door, looking for me. This is just beyond the pale.\"\n\nThe backlash Switlyk received for posting the photos is a familiar one for hunters who have chosen to have \u2013 or have had \u2013 their exploits shared on the Internet.\n\nOne of the most notable incidents in recent years was the killing of Cecil the lion by American dentist and trophy hunter Walter Palmer in 2015.\n\nAnother case led a hunter to quit his job amid pressure from colleagues. Blake Fischer, a former Idaho Fish and Game commissioner, left his post in mid-October after an image surfaced purportedly showing him standing over a family of baboons killed during a hunting trip to Namibia.\n\nThe Trump brothers, Don Jr. and Eric have also routinely been criticized for old photos of them hunting in Africa which included them posing with a dead leopard.\n\nFischer declined to comment for this article, but one hunter who did says some of the criticism has gone too far.\n\nTess Thompson Talley, who came under fire this summer after images surfaced of her posting with an African giraffe kill, told Fox News: \u201cFirst of all I would like to say that I fully understand people who are against hunting.\n\n\"It is certainly their right to not agree with it, even speak out against it. However, for anyone to threaten bodily harm or even death against anyone is wrong.\u201d\n\nTalley says images of kills that are posted online are \u201cnot done to rub it in the face of non-hunters, vegetarians and vegans.\n\n\u201cThis is a way of honoring the animals who have given their lives for hunters to be able to provide clean, healthy protein for themselves, their family and friends,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNobody has the right to threaten people for something that is legal, ethical and ultimately (in my opinion) helps the populations of wildlife to remain healthy and numerous, just because they don\u2019t believe in it,\u201d Talley added.\n\nHer statements were echoed by Oliva Nalos Opre, a big game hunter and former beauty queen who has faced backlash after making the argument in a television interview that funds generated from trophy hunts help with anti-poaching and conservation efforts.\n\n\u201cHunters need to be cognizant that photos of their hunting memories may be interpreted negatively by those who have lost touch with Mother Nature and our need to provide healthy meat to our families utilizing one of the greatest tools for science-based wildlife conservation \u2014 legal, well-regulated hunting,\u201d Opre told Fox News. \u201cHunters must show through their photos the respect we have for nature and its bounty.\u201d\n\nAnimal rights organizations that spoke to Fox News, however, called the hunting for conservation argument a \"ruse\" -- and said \"much of the money goes to trophy hunting operations, outfitters, and government agencies, some of which are corrupt.\n\n\"PETA welcomes trophy hunters to air the bloodlust behind their killing sprees on social media, as it gives away who they really are: insecure, callous, undesirable people who try to hide their sadism behind a phony notion of \"conservation,\" with the emphasis on con,\" a PETA spokesperson said. \"Reducing magnificent wild animals minding their own business to corpses, gloating over the kills, and then claiming that it's all for \"conservation\" is like killing some humans to try to solve homelessness \u2014 it's nasty, completely unethical, and transparently absurd.\"\n\nPriscilla Feral, president of the Connecticut-based Friends of Animals group, told Fox News that \"when trophy hunters pose for photographs next to their oryx antelope, lion, elephant, leopard, giraffe, or other animals, their motivation is ego, not conservation.\n\n\"Shooting animals either on a hunting ranch or in the wild doesn't define conservation,\" she added.\n\nA recent National Geographic article also quotes an American biologist as saying that the money raised from exotic big game hunts falls far short of what is needed to sustain the environments they take place in.\n\nThe debate over trophy hunting is not expected to go away any time soon. And it seems the criticism facing hunters who post their images of their kills online is here to stay as well.", "An anonymous woman has made headlines across the internet for going on an expletive-filled tirade full of racist and homophobic slurs against her male seatmate.\n\nThe incident occurred on Nov. 2 on a domestic U.S. flight, and the woman began her rant soon before the aircraft landed at Los Angeles International Airport, according to the Mirror.\n\nThe identity of the passenger, and airline on which the event unfolded, remains unknown at this time.

He also paid homage to Lech Walesa, the Solidarity trade union founder who challenged Poland's Soviet-backed communist rule during the 1980s and went on to become president from 1990 to 1995.\n\n\"Jozef Pilsudski was facing a more difficult situation than we have today when he was conquering the Bolsheviks and in fact, defending the Western community against political barbarians,\" Tusk said during an independent anniversary forum.\n\n\"Walesa had a more difficult situation when he was conquering the Bolsheviks in a symbolic way, when he was bringing out the European, the freedom, the national values in us.

The Moscow meeting included Libyan National Army head Khalifa Hifter, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of staff of Russia's armed forces.\n\nPrigozhin is allegedly tied to a military contractor believed to have sent thousands of mercenaries to Syria, augmenting regular Russian troops deployed there. He also has been indicted by the United States over the alleged Russian \"troll farm\" accused of using social media to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nPrigozhin's presence at the meeting had not been reported by the Defense Ministry. Several hours after Novaya Gazeta wrote about the video, state news agencies cited an unnamed military source as saying that Prigozhin had arranged the official dinner for the visit and took part in discussing its \"cultural program.\"\n\nThe businessman has been dubbed \"Putin's chef\" for organizing catering for the Russian president and even personally serving him on occasion.\n\nReports have linked him to the private security contractor Wagner, which has been characterized as effectively an unofficial arm of the defense ministry.

Is this just fantasy? For Tim Staffell, it\u2019s both.\n\nThe English rock artist is enjoying newfound attention after he was briefly depicted in the Freddie Mercury biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d which shrugged off production troubles and mediocre reviews to debut with $50 million in weekend ticket sales in U.S. and Canada, and another $72.5 million internationally.\n\nWhile \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d was largely dismissed by critics, Staffell, who was the bassist/singer of pre-Queen band Smile before Mercury took his place, said he was pleased with the production.\n\n\u201cIt was exactly the right way to do it,\u201d the 70-year-old told Fox News. \u201cWhen Sacha Baron Cohen was originally in line to play Freddie, I read a couple of interviews by him and I thought to myself, \u2018What kind of picture are they making?\u2019 \u2026 Once they got Rami [Malek] to play Freddie and I started to see how it was going, I realized it was the right way to do it. \u2026 And it compresses 15 years really well into two hours. I just thought it was right.\u201d\n\nStaffell said he was approached by the film\u2019s producers to include Smile\u2019s original track \u201cDoin\u2019 Alright,\u201d which was initially recorded in 1969.\n\n\u201cAlthough Queen did the song in their first album, the style of the performance in the film needed to be more related to the vintage Smile version,\u201d said Staffell. \u201cI was able to provide the vocal and bass guitar for the movie. And the result was much more authentic. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with myself if I couldn\u2019t manage it.\u201d\n\nHowever, Staffell admitted \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d did alter the history of Queen\u2019s formation for audiences. In the movie, viewers can see Mercury [Malek] stumbling into a 1970 gig to check out Smile, which included future bandmates Roger Taylor and Brian May, after a fight with his parents.\n\nHe enthusiastically meets up with Smile after their show, conveniently just minutes after Staffell [Jack Roth] quits. While May and Taylor are initially skeptical of the stranger with too-big teeth, Mercury\u2019s powerful pipes instantly compelled them to welcome him into the band.\n\nIn reality, Staffell and Mercury, then Freddie Bulsara, were longtime friends, having met in London\u2019s Ealing Art College where they were studying graphic design.\n\n\u201cWe were both part of the same social circles, which happened to revolve around bands at the time,\u201d said Staffell. \u201cFreddie had his own band. I remember going to one of Freddie\u2019s bands in Liverpool at the time. And he used to come and see Smile.\u201d\n\nSmile, which included Staffell, May and Taylor formed in 1968 and was one of many groups circulating London\u2019s thriving rock scene. Mercury was a fan of Smile and would frequently attend their performances.\n\nStaffell shared that at that time, his classmate was far from the iconic rock star the world knows today.\n\n\u201cHe was kind of shy really,\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the flamboyant character that he later became\u2026 We were both working musicians, even though we were semi-professional ones. He used to love Hendrix. I still remember him playing air guitar on a long ruler in a classic while Hendrix blared out over the radio. That\u2019s one of my endearing memories.\u201d\n\nBut the seemingly quiet Mercury had big plans for his future.\n\n\u201cHe used to say, \u2018Someday I\u2019m going o be a superstar,\u2019\u201d said Staffell. \u201cThe rest of his classmates used to say, \u2018Yeah, yeah Freddie. Sure you are.\u2019 Possibly I did as well.\u201d\n\nAnd a major break would come for Mercury. In 1970, Staffell decided to quit Smile.\n\n\u201cI was really more interested in the kind of music that allowed improvisation,\u201d said Staffell. \u201cI wanted to play the blues. I wanted to play some jazz. And I really enjoyed working with musicians where the format allowed us to express ourselves differently every night. With Smile\u2026 there wasn\u2019t a huge amount of leeway for that improvisation. So I just moved on.\u201d\n\nStaffell insisted that having his friend replace him in Smile was \u201cthe logical choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt became apparent around that time that within the live music context, he was a performer,\u201d said Staffell. \u201cHe used to perform on stage, which is something I actually never did. I was never a performer. I certainly didn\u2019t have the stage presence that Freddie was beginning to develop at the time. And it was fantastic for all of us. His classmates followed him.\u201d\n\nAfter Mercury joined the band, Smile emerged as Queen and rose to fame. Staffell said he has no regrets about his decision.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, if I had stayed on, there wouldn\u2019t have been any excuse to get Freddie into the band,\u201d he explained. \u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t really regret it. I was excited for Freddie, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nStaffell moved on from Smile and kept busy with other local bands. But by the mid-\u201870s he made another life-changing decision \u2014 to leave music altogether.\n\n\u201cI was living with my wife at that point and it was becoming very apparent that what little money I was getting from music just wasn\u2019t paying the bills,\u201d he said. I was trained as a graphic designer in college, but I\u2019ve been out of it for some time. And I thought to myself, \u2018What I really would like to do is go into TV special effects.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the next 30 years, Staffell focused on model making, animation, and special effects. He was also the chief model maker for Season One of the children\u2019s TV show \u201cThomas the Tank Engine.\u201d Then in 2000, Staffell closed his company down and returned to music. He\u2019s currently gearing up to release a new album, titled \u201cTwo Late,\u201d in mid-November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely contemporary material,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s closely alike to what I said before, about wanting to produce music and improvise\u2026 I\u2019m trying to blend good songs with intelligent lyrics that allows maximum improvisation.\"\n\nStaffell\u2019s beloved friend passed away in 1991 at age 45 from AIDS. Today, Staffell is honored to help tell the story of Mercury and Queen on the big screen, all while looking ahead into the future.\n\n\u201cI feel as if I\u2019ve got a tiger by the tail,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited. I\u2019m just doing my best to ride this out for as long as I can.\u201d", "Florida police are investigating why a college student died unexpectedly earlier this week.\n\nJessie Lauren Melcolm, a student at Tallahassee Community College, was found unresponsive Tuesday in her apartment.

And if it was ever really put back together, it was put back together differently wearing the wounds of World War One that we continue to live with today,\" said Matthew Naylor, the president and C.E.O of the National World War One Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\"It was a war which completely changed the trajectory of the United States and had such a profound bearing on the globe, the first war that people from all inhabited continents of the globe participated in, truly a global war\" he notes.\n\nWORLD WAR I POSTERS OFFER UNIQUE GLIMPSE INTO SOLDIERS' STORIES 100 YEARS AFTER THE ARMISTICE\n\n\"The Europeans themselves, of course, experienced losses that are unheard of today, thank God, we would not tolerate. The type of carnage that there was, 7,200 deaths a week, 300 a day, 5 a minute for more than four years, every minute, every hour of every day, every week for more than four years.\n\n\"There never was enough coffins, never enough ways to bury the dead, such was the degree of carnage. It reoriented the world, helped us learn what we can do to one another, and caused the world to gasp and step back.\"\n\nNaylor oversees the nation's preeminent institution that marks the conflict. The stunning and imposing limestone memorial is unique. It was funded in 1919 by local residents who raised $2.5 million dollars in just ten days, or $40 million in today's dollars, to build it. The memorial was dedicated in 1926, and all five allied commanders from the war attended, as did President Calvin Coolidge.\n\nThe museum and Kansas City's skyline is dominated by the imposing Liberty Memorial Tower that rises above the museum and surrounding 47-acre hilltop park. It commands a sweeping view of the city and serves as a powerful, poignant and solemn reminder of the sacrifices of so many.\n\nToday the museum is visited by half a million people each year, and the horrors from a century ago continue to resonate. Visitors can see tanks, machine guns, gas masks and the other weapons of war that are on display, as well as read the touching personal letters from troops and study the patriotic art of the era, including the famous \"Uncle Sam Wants You\" recruiting poster. The museum was renovated and vastly enlarged in 2006.\n\nTHIS BULLET-SCARRED BIBLE \u2018SAVED THE LIFE\u2019 OF A WORLD WAR I SOLDIER\n\nThe first global conflict was so barbaric that it introduced the role of modern mechanized warfare, such as the use of gas on the Western Front and untold new ways for mass killing.\n\nThe war started in 1914 and America entered on April 6th, 1917, joining allies Britain, France and Russia against Germany and its allies.\n\nThe trench warfare was especially brutal.\n\n\"35,000 miles of trenches were created, even though the front was only 436 miles,\" says Naylor. \"Your friends are going up over the top, and many of them are going to be killed. When is it going to be your turn to do that?\"\n\nChemical weapons like mustard and chlorine gas and phosphates were first deployed on the modern battlefield that all added to the barbaric losses.\n\nAMERICA'S DEADLIEST BATTLE: WORLD WAR I'S MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE 100 YEARS LATER\n\n\"We soon learned the horrors of their use. The legacies of death and horror remain,\" Naylor notes.\n\nThe United States' involvement also marked the emergence of our nation's role in international affairs.\n\n\"In many respects, you cannot think of the 20th century, you can't think of the American Century without understanding the impact that World War One had in drawing the U.S onto the world stage. It retreated somewhat after the war, but soon found itself drawn back in, arguably a position from which it has never retreated,\" Naylor says.\n\n\"World War One birthed what we know as modern America, a major player in international affairs, a tremendous industrial and financial powerhouse, a champion of ideals, that's what drew the U.S. into the war, were those ideals and it has had a profound bearing on the last 100 years and the role of the United States in world affairs.\"\n\nThe war also advanced social and cultural change here at home.\n\nINCREDIBLE WORLD WAR I DIARY SURFACES\n\n\"There was a deconstruction of the previous age and an emergence of the new that World War One really helped birth. We see from the war the impact on civil rights, the experience of African Americans serving with the French, primarily,\" Naylor says. \"That really added momentum to the civil rights movement and the suffragette movement and the changing roles of women during World War One. \"\n\nBut today, the war and our country's contribution to victory, have largely receded from the national consciousness.\n\nThe last American veteran, Frank Buckles, died seven years ago at age 110.\n\n\"The Civil War and World War Two occupy the public imagination in the way World War One does not,\" Naylor explains.\n\n\"It's a very messy war. It is complicated, and so it\u2019s difficult for people to get their head around. Secondly, the United States involvement was relatively short despite the fact that the largest military campaign in American military history occurred during World War One.\"\n\n100-YEAR OLD LETTER FROM WWI UNCOVERED\n\nBut the sacrifices of the more than 4 million Americans who served, and of the more than 116,000 U.S. troops who were killed, remain a focal point of the museum.\n\n\"The tragedy is once you get past the third or fourth generation, we tend to forget. Part of our work here is to remember those who served and to continue to tell the story and learn from the enduring impact of the war,\" notes Naylor.\n\n\"Our work now is about interpreting, remembering and understanding the great war. It's 100 years ago, so we need to continue to protect and preserve those memories, to honor those who served and then to also examine its enduring impact. The reality is that we live in the war's shadow here, one hundred years later. Every day we wake up dealing with the consequences of decisions made and actions taken during World War One and so our work is about examining that with the hope to create a more just and prosperous future.\"\n\nDespite the war's historical significance, there is no national memorial in Washington, D.C., but one is planned. It will, like the museum, commemorate what was once called \"the war to end all wars,\" a noble goal that so sadly was not achieved.\n\n\"Its legacy cannot be underestimated,\" says Naylor. \"Our work is to be able to tell that story, and to help people understand and learn.\"\n\nBen Evansky and Lloyd Gottschalk contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Eric Shawn on Twitter: @EricShawnTV", "Track Emailers\n\nQ: I\u2019m getting strange email.

The former Serbian province declared independence in 2008 which Belgrade doesn't recognize.\n\nSerbian officials are especially worried by plans of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leadership to transform its security forces into regular army troops. Serbs have warned of unspecified measures to prevent that move and \"protect\" the Serbian minority in Kosovo.\n\nSupported by its ally Russia, Serbia recently increased its sabre rattling over Kosovo, including raising combat readiness of its troops over a series of small incidents. Serbia's army intervention in Kosovo would trigger a direct clash with NATO-led peacekeepers stationed there.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who attended the military exercises held in different parts of Serbia, said the Balkan country will strengthen its \"offensive\" forces with new equipment, including helicopters, 30 battle tanks from Russia and drones from China.\n\n\"We are dramatically strengthening our military,\" Vucic told state broadcaster RTS. \"No one in the region, except maybe Romania, can compare to us.\"\n\nSerbia is often wrongly accused of starting World War I after teenage Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Bosnia, in 1914, triggering a series of events that eventually led to the war.\n\nSerbia lost about half of its male population during the four-year war, including 130,000 troops in a series of battles in the Balkans against a much stronger enemy.

The presidency has since alternated between the two parties, with the Nationalists, also known as the KMT, seen as more pro-China, and the DPP backing formal independence for Taiwan.\n\nIn Saturday's debate, incumbent Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, an independent, asked voters to continue supporting him, but the ruling party's candidate, Pasuya Yao, said Ko has failed to make any changes in Taipei in the past four years.\n\nYao further emphasized that Taipei doesn't want to be bound by China's threats.\n\nTing Shou-chung, the Nationalist Party candidate, pledged to lead Taipei out of economic difficulties and to help foster a better relationship with China.\n\nTwo independent candidates \u2014 Li Hsi-kun and Wu E-yang \u2014 also took part in the debate.\n\nSurveys show most Taiwanese favor their island's current de facto independent status, rejecting both formal independence that might spark a military assault by China and political unification with Beijing.\n\nWhile China had in recent years largely eschewed threats that might spark a backlash at the polls, this year's elections come against the background of rising tensions over Beijing's demand that Tsai \u2014 who is up for re-election in 2020 \u2014 acknowledge its \"one-China\" principle that views Taiwan as a part of China under the Communist Party. China has increased diplomatic and economic pressure on Tsai's administration while staging military drills underscoring its determination to conquer the island by force if necessary.\n\nYet, local issues are likely to play a bigger factor among voters. The high-tech economy has struggled to match the growth rates of past years, leading to wage stagnation, particularly among the young, while there have also been pushes for pension reform and government streamlining to keep government spending in check.\n\nTaipei's aging housing stock and delays in projects such as a massive new sports and entertainment venue are also issues for voters in the island's capital.\n\nTaiwan's democracy is known for exuberant campaigning, including massive outdoor rallies, caravans of vehicles promoting the candidates, and visits to markets and parks.\n\nTaipei Mayor Ko, 59, gained added attention this year by starring in a rap video, and online messaging has grown increasingly important in one of the world's most wired societies.\n\nThat's also brought warnings of cyberattacks and disinformation coming from China, similar to how Russian government-backed entities are believed to have spread fake news in the U.S.\n\nKo came under attack for skipping a first debate earlier this month, with critics calling him aloof and the mayor defending himself as a diligent administrator.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nA Syrian woman captured by Islamic State militants said her 8-year-old son died in her lap when the extremists shot him and his cousin during a military operation to liberate them more than 100 days after they were kidnapped.\n\nNajwa Abu Ammar was kidnapped with her two sons and daughter and nearly two dozen others in July from southern Sweida province in a bloody attack on their villages in which the militants killed over 200 people.\n\nWhen a military operation began to liberate them Thursday, the children panicked during the gunfire, she said.

They didn't torture them, Abu Ammar said, but started threatening to kill them as time passed.\n\nAt least two women and one man died in captivity, including a woman who was shot by the extremists to pressure authorities in negotiations for the captives' release.\n\nAbu Ammar's husband said she looked frail.\n\n\"Sometimes they fed us once every two days and other times twice every day,\" Abu Ammar said, adding that it was mostly just olive oil, thyme and jam.\n\n\"They held us first in a camp then a cave and kept moving us from one place to the other,\" she said.\n\nAbu Ammar said she didn't know about the killed hostages until they were liberated.\n\nSix other hostages, two women and four children, had been freed in an exchange with the government in October. Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but talks failed and Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria.\n\nThe rare attacks in the province populated mainly by minority Druze included several suicide bombings.

Trump unleashed an angry Twitter jab at his French host as he arrived in France late Friday.

Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nMacron's office said Trump misunderstood Macron's comments.\n\nThe leaders met Saturday at the Elysee Palace and, asked about the tweet, Trump said Macron \"understand that the United States can only do so much,\" adding that the U.S. wants to help. Trump added that he and Macron are \"getting along from the standpoint of fairness.\"\n\nMacron defended his viewpoint, saying \"I do share President Trump's views that we need a much better burden sharing with NATO and that's why I do believe that my proposal for a European defense\" is \"utterly consistent with that.\"\n\nAn official in Macron's office said Trump lumped together two different comments by the French president, and that the comments would be on the table for Saturday's meeting. By custom, the official was not authorized to be publicly name.\n\nMacron said in an interview earlier this week that Europe needs to protect itself against \"China, Russia and even the United States\" in terms of cyberspace. Later, Macron reiterated that Europe needs to build up its own military because it can no longer depend on the U.S. for defense.\n\nTrump has made similar arguments, particularly in urging NATO's European members to increase its share of defense spending.\n\nMacron greeted Trump with a handshake and pats on the arm as the American president arrived at the Elysee Palace in a cool drizzle. Both leaders flashed a thumbs-up to waiting reporters but ignored their shouted questions about Macron's remarks and Trump's reaction.\n\nIn comment before the leaders went behind closed doors for talks, Macron referred to Trump as \"my good friend\" and appeared to tap him on the thigh.\n\nThe comments by Trump were a fresh sign that the \"America first\" president was ready to chart his own course yet again as world leaders gathered to remember the coalition that brought an end to the first global war in which millions were killed.\n\nTrump was joining scores of other world leaders Sunday for a ceremony in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe to mark the WWI centennial.\n\nThe weekend visit comes on the heels of midterm elections in which Americans delivered a split referendum on his presidency, keeping the Senate in his Republican Party's control but giving control of the House to opposition Democrats.\n\nTrump and first lady Melania Trump were also visiting the American cemetery in Belleau, France, on Saturday to pay respects to U.S. soldiers who died on French soil during World War I.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Angela Charlton contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nFollow Jill Colvin and Darlene Superville on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj and https://twitter.com/dsupervilleap", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe Latest on President Donald Trump in France (all times local):\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is meeting with France's President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nTrump pulled up in his limousine Saturday at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace where he was greeted by Macron.\n\nThe two men briefly shook hands and ignored shouted questions about Trump's criticism of his French host he delivered as he landed in Paris the night before.\n\nTrump tweeted Friday night that Macron \"has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia.

At least 57,538 people \u2014 civilians and combatants \u2014 have been killed since the beginning of 2016, according to the data assembled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED.\n\nThat doesn't include the first nine months of the war, in 2015, which the group is still analyzing. Those data are likely to raise the figure to 70,000 or 80,000, ACLED's Yemen researcher Andrea Carboni told The Associated Press. The organization's count is considered by many international agencies to be one of the most credible, although all caution it is likely an underestimate because of the difficulties in tracking deaths.\n\nThe numbers don't include those who have died in the humanitarian disaster caused by the war, particularly starvation. Though there are no firm figures, the aid group Save the Children estimated hunger may have killed 50,000 children in 2017. That was based on a calculation that around 30 percent of severely malnourished children who didn't receive proper treatment likely died.\n\nRenewed uproar over the destruction has put Washington in a corner. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to Saudi Arabia, backing the fight to stop Shiite rebels known as Houthis, who Washington and the coalition consider a proxy for Iran.\n\nThat along with tensions over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the country's consulate in Istanbul may be key factors why Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Oct. 30 made their biggest push yet for an end to the war, calling for a ceasefire within 30 days and resumed negotiations.\n\nOnly a month earlier, Pompeo gave a powerful show of support to the coalition by certifying to Congress that Saudi Arabia and its allies were taking measures to prevent civilian casualties. Certification was a required step in continuing U.S. aid, which includes providing intelligence used in targeting and mid-air refueling for coalition planes.\n\nBut deaths from the coalition campaign show no sign of slowing.\n\nCoalition airstrikes and shelling killed at least 4,489 civilians since the beginning of 2016 \u2014 nearly three-quarters of all known civilian deaths, according to ACLED's figures.\n\nAs of Nov. 3, at least 1,254 civilians were killed by the coalition this year, a rate of four a day. In comparison, 1,386 civilians died in strikes the previous year, or 3.79 a day.\n\nAsked about the finding, the U.S. State Department said in an emailed reply, \"Throughout this conflict, the United States has urged all parties to abide by the Law of Armed Conflict, work to prevent harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure, and thoroughly investigate and ensure accountability for any violations.\"\n\nBloodshed has surged from fierce fighting at the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, which coalition forces have been trying to retake from the Houthis since June. Civilians have been killed in airstrikes as well as by Houthi shelling and land mines.\n\nSince June, more than 4,500 people \u2014 including 515 confirmed civilians \u2014 have been killed in Hodeida, nearly triple the number from the first five months of the year.\n\nAid agencies fear worse is yet to come. The coalition appears to be accelerating its assault before any cease-fire. Its forces have nearly encircled the city, where tens of thousands of people are trapped along with thousands of Houthi fighters. The port is Yemen's main point of entry for food and humanitarian aid, so any cutoff could push millions into starvation.\n\nThe coalition launched its air campaign in March 2015 after the Houthis took over northern and central Yemen, driving out the internationally recognized government. The rebels were prevented from overrunning the south only by the coalition's bombardment and support for militia forces.\n\nTracking casualties is enormously difficult. The few independent monitors on the ground do not have wide access; officials on both sides have an interest in manipulating figures; deaths often take place in remote areas and even in populated areas, confusion of battle makes confirming numbers hard.\n\nThe most widely used estimate has been 10,000 dead, made in January 2017 by the United Nations.\n\nIn October, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator said at least 65,000 people have been killed or injured since 2016, including 16,000 civilians killed, based on data from health centers.

Of those, shelling by the Houthis or their allies killed 977.\n\nThe full toll is likely much higher.

The attack horrified hundreds of onlookers during the afternoon rush hour in Australia's second-biggest city.\n\nVictoria state Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said that Shire Ali, who was shot by police and died in a hospital, had also planned for his vehicle to explode, but barbecue gas cylinders in the back of his pickup failed to ignite.\n\n\"It looks like he's attempted to ignite a fire in the car, we believe at this stage with a view to igniting those canisters with some sort of explosion, but that didn't eventuate,\" Ashton told Australia's Channel 9 TV network.\n\nAshton said Shire Ali, who moved to Australia from Somalia in the 1990s, was known to police and the federal intelligence authority ASIO partly because his brother Ali Khalif Shire Ali faced court this year in Melbourne accused of plotting another attack.\n\n\"He's someone that was known to us,\" Ashton said. \"But he wasn't someone we were actively monitoring to that level.\"\n\nAshton said Shire Ali had a criminal history for cannabis use, theft and driving offences.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released through its Aamaq media arm, but provided no evidence. It said the man was an Islamic State fighter and had responded to IS calls for attacks in countries that are part of the international coalition fighting the militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIS, which has suffered heavy battlefield setbacks in the past year, often claims attacks without any clear connection.\n\nPolice and civilians had tried unsuccessfully to subdue Shire Ali during Friday's attack, before police shot him in the chest.\n\nA man aged 74, who had been stabbed in the face, died at the scene. Two other men, aged 26 and 58, are in a hospital with what police describe as non-life threatening injuries.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corp. said police were searching two Melbourne properties on Saturday in relation to the attack. Ashton said, however, that police did not believe there were any ongoing threats to the public.\n\nIt's the second time in four years Australia has witnessed militant violence.\n\nIn December 2014, a 17-hour siege in which a gunman took 18 people hostage in a Sydney cafe ended with two hostages dead and the assailant killed by police. Though the erratic gunman demanded that police deliver him an Islamic State flag at the outset of the crisis, there was no evidence he had established contact with the militant group. However, at a later inquest, the coroner of New South Wales state said the gunman's actions fell \"within the accepted definition of terrorism.\"\n\nMelbourne was also the scene of two fatal car-ramming incidents last year, but neither was linked by police to terrorism.\n\nAshton says there is no suggestion Shire Ali was inspired by James \"Dimitrious\" Gargasoulas, who faced court this week on six charges of murder over the first ramming attack, in January 2017.", "Local Democratic officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties in Florida are recklessly violating state law in what may be an attempt to overturn the results of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections for governor and the U.S. Senate in the Sunshine State.\n\nThis looks like a repeat of the actions in Florida in the 2000 presidential election, when Democratic officials ignored state election laws \u2013 and were slapped down by the U.S. Supreme Court in a 7-2 decision.\n\nBroward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda C. Snipes said Tuesday night that 634,000 votes had been cast in the county. But by Thursday night, Snipes was claiming 712,840 ballots had been cast.\n\nThe effect of these newly discovered votes that inexplicably appeared long after they should have been counted shrunk the leads of Republicans Gov. Rick Scott in the Senate race and former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis in the gubernatorial contest.\n\nLate Tuesday night Scott was up roughly 57,000 votes in his race against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. By Friday afternoon, Scott\u2019s lead had declined dramatically to about 15,000 votes.\n\nLate Tuesday night DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in the gubernatorial race by 75,000 votes. But Friday afternoon DeSantis was ahead by less than half that \u2013 about 36,000 votes.\n\nBroward County officials blatantly disregarded the Florida law requiring that all vote-by-mail and absentee ballots be accounted for within 30 minutes of the polls closing.\n\nThough the county\u2019s voting locations closed at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Snipes said Friday that she still didn\u2019t know how many ballots remain to be processed. Nor could she say how many provisional, military or mismarked ballots she had in her possession.\n\nMysteriously, over 70,000 ballots have been counted since Tuesday night with apparently no one knowing how many more are still to come.\n\nIn addition, at least one ballot box for provisional votes was left unattended at a polling place \u2013 a school where it was discovered days after the election. The box was locked but not sealed, and could have been tampered with or stuffed. Could there be others?\n\nSnipes then refused to allow Republican officials to inspect all ballots before they are submitted to the Canvassing Board. And she refused other requests for public records that should be available under Florida\u2019s expansive \u201csunshine laws,\u201d drawing a sharp rebuke from a judge late Friday afternoon.\n\nIn response to Republican lawsuits, Florida state Judge Carol-Lisa Phillips ruled Friday that \u201cthere has been a violation of the Florida constitution\u201d and the state\u2019s public records act by Broward County officials. The judge sided with Scott and ordered that Republicans should be granted \u201cimmediate access\u201d to information they have requested about ballots Broward County.\n\nThere are also problems in next-door Palm Beach County.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher stopped filing updates of the vote count with the Florida Department of State as required by law. The law mandates that she report every 45 minutes until all the election results are in.\n\nInstead, Bucher dropped news of the 15,000 surprise ballots she\u2019s counted since Tuesday night at any time she chose.\n\nBesides telling the state to get lost, Bucher is also refusing to allow designated official political party representatives into the ballot counting area. She\u2019s kept them isolated behind a glass wall where they can\u2019t see and hear all that\u2019s going on \u2013 yet another violation of Florida election law.\n\nEven more troubling, Bucher has copied vote-by-mail ballots that she claims are damaged, but without allowing witnesses to observe the process as required by Florida law. In fact, she explicitly denied requests for witnesses to see her staff at work.\n\nAs election supervisor, Bucher also assumed the power to determine what constitutes a \u201cvalid vote.\u201d Under Florida law, she doesn\u2019t have that authority. She can only refer questionable ballots to the county\u2019s bipartisan Canvassing Board.\n\nThis is not the first time these two Board of Election supervisors have shown contempt for their official responsibilities under Florida law, especially Snipes in Broward County.\n\nIn 2012 Snipes was criticized for absentee ballots that never arrived, balky scanners that didn\u2019t work, slow reporting and mounds of ballots that showed up long after Election Day.\n\nIn 2014 Snipes demonstrated such incompetence that even fellow Democrats complained her office made it difficult for people to vote.\n\nIn 2016 Snipes allowed her employees to campaign on county time, violated state law by posting election results half an hour before the polls closed and was sued for leaving amendments off the ballots.\n\nA judge also ruled that Snipes\u2019 office violated state and federal laws by illegally destroying ballots. But the ruling regarding her action illegally obliterating evidence two years ago did not come down until this year.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more.\n\nIn 2017, accusations of ballot stuffing swirled around Snipes\u2019 office during local elections. She even admitted that ineligible voters who were on the rolls and had voted.\n\nThis year Snipes has drawn more fire. It was revealed that her office broke Florida law earlier this election season by opening ballots in private without observers present (maybe a trick she learned from Bucher).\n\nThen after people complained they didn\u2019t get their absentee ballots, it turned out that Snipes failed to notify some voters that their right to cast an absentee ballot had expired. She blamed it on not having enough funds to mail notifications. Maybe that was because she wasted her budget by sending some voters ballots with duplicate pages.\n\nThis may all be rank incompetence, but perhaps these actions by two Democratic election officials are a smokescreen for something worse \u2013 a deliberate attempt to overturn the Florida election results.\n\nFortunately, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., blew the whistle and the Scott campaign, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Republican National Committee have rushed to the scene of the possible crime and filed lawsuits to ensure that voters \u2013 not Democratic officials \u2013 pick the next governor and U.S. senator in Florida.\n\nThere may be a basis for the U.S. Justice Department to intervene and investigate this troubling situation in Broward and Palm Beach counties to answer the obvious question:\n\nAre Democratic elections officials deliberately breaking the law and playing games to delay everything just long enough so they can create just the number of ballots needed to overturn the election results to install Gillum as governor and keep Nelson in the Senate?\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of behavior you expect in Third World banana republics \u2013 not true great democracies, and certainly not the United States.\n\nLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s not too late and that any election fraud in Broward and Palm Beach counties in Florida can be reversed.", "Passengers aboard a plane headed to London this week were ordered to evacuate by French authorities after it was revealed that the carrier owed a substantial amount of money from 2014.\n\nThe Ryanair Boeing 737 was impounded and all 149 passengers were told to turn around and head back to the Bordeaux-Merignac airport in western France.\n\nTravelers were left out of the loop for most of the ordeal, with only two text messages telling them that the departure was delayed and that they would receive vouchers worth about $6 for food.

Trump is the de facto leader of Western nationalism, while Macron has cast himself as the leading international proponent of European globalism. In an address to Congress, he called for the preservation of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate deal -- from which the U.S. withdrew at Trump's direction.\n\nAt the United Nations in September, the Frenchman took a swipe at Trump\u2019s brand of nationalism, criticizing a unilateralist approach that entails \"a certain lawlessness where everyone pursues their own interests.\"\n\n\u201cI will never stop upholding the principle of sovereignty even in the face of a certain nationalism, which we\u2019re seeing today, brandishing sovereignty as a way of attacking others,\" he said just hours after Trump addressed the General Assembly.\n\nThe spat over the European army indicates that relations could be deteriorating further.\n\nMACRON POPULARITY PLUMMETS AT HOME AS HE PUSHES GLOBALISM ON WORLD STAGE\n\nTrump has often complained about the burden placed on the U.S. from NATO obligations, noting that the U.S. has an enormous military budget, part of which is spent covering protecting allies abroad -- including in Europe. In July, he complained, \"We're protecting Germany, we're protecting France. We're protecting everybody. And yet we're paying a lot of money to protect.\"\n\nNATO itself does not have a defense budget, but members commit to spending a minimum of 2 percent of their Gross Domestic Product to defense spending -- although a number of countries do not meet this commitment. For 2018, the U.S. is spending 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense spending. Meanwhile France is spending 1.81 percent, and only a handful of NATO countries are meeting that 2 percent commitment.\n\nAccording to NATO figures, total defense spending of all NATO members in 2017 was $917 billion, and the U.S. spent about $618 billion, meaning the U.S. spent approximately 70 percent of all NATO members. However, that figure was for all U.S. defense spending, not contributions to NATO. The U.S. also pays for approximately 22 percent of NATO's common funding.\n\nBut Trump's unhappiness with the comments are likely in part because Macron lumped in the U.S. with traditional European foes in his justification.\n\nFormer U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage told Fox Business\u2019 Stuart Varney earlier Friday that the army was a sign of Macron was a \u201cEurofanatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Macron to do it just a few days before President Trump goes to commemorate the centenary of the end of the Great War, the First World War, I think was absolutely crass in the extreme,\u201d Farage, a Fox News contributor, said. \u201cMaybe you can see now why his poll ratings are collapsing in France.\u201d\n\nThe idea of some sort of European army has been mulled on the continent for decades in various forms. However, it is unlikely to see support from a number of countries. Italy is currently going through a nationalist and Eurosceptic resurgence. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing pressure from nationalists in her country, while Britain is leaving the European Union.\n\nBut while Macron's idea may be somewhat extreme and premature, it may also reflect the political difficulties he faces at home. His approval ratings have dived as low as 29 percent as he faces accusations of being out of touch, and struggles to deal with domestic economic problems and the repercussions of the 2015 migration crisis.\n\nA number of politically awkward viral moments -- including him recently lecturing an out-of-work gardener to look harder for a job -- have not helped.\n\nBut Macron has brushed off concerns about lagging poll numbers. In a recent interview with Bloomberg News, he noted that unlike Trump he does not yet have to worry about poll numbers.\n\n\"I have a big advantage, I don\u2019t have any midterms elections. So I am not driven by polls,\" Macron said. \u201cI have to reform the country in depth.

That now seems more likely for later this month, when they attend the Group of 20 summit of international leaders in Argentina.\n\nTrump and Putin have met previously on the sidelines of two summits and had their own bilateral meeting in July in Helsinki. At that meeting, Trump would not say whether he believed Putin or U.S. intelligence agencies about their conclusions about Russia's interference with the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump's brief visit to Europe comes amid uncertainty about the U.S. relationship with the continent. Trump has railed against trade deals with the European Union and has criticized some EU nations, including France, for not spending enough to defense to sustain NATO, the decades-old Western alliance formed as a bulwark to Moscow's aggression.\n\nTrump's national security adviser, John Bolton, said Friday in Paris that the U.S. was concerned about stability in Europe and that Trump was not shirking from global engagement. \"I think the enduring lesson (of World War I) for the United States is that when you become a global power ... you have global interests to protect,\" Bolton said. \"Great world leaders,\" he said, are \"driven by national interests.\"\n\nTrump and Macron's early relationship was marked by kisses, frequent meetings and marathon power handshakes. Early on, Macron tried to position himself as a sort of \"Trump whisperer\" and Trump returned the favor, hosting Macron at the first and only state dinner of his presidency. But the relationship-building failed to persuade Trump to remain in the global climate change agreement or Iran deals and did nothing to protect France from U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe dividends of Macron's cultivation of Trump are \"modest at best,\" said Stewart M. Patrick, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAt the same time, Macron has increasingly been positioning himself as a bulwark against the rising tide of Trump-style populism across Europe, speaking out loudly against the dangers of nationalism and isolationist retreat.\n\n\"He's starting to become the antithesis of President Trump's public messaging,\" said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan Lemire in New York and Elaine Ganley in Paris contributed to this report.", "", "American troops stepped onto European soil in 1917, ready to fight alongside the Allies in World War I. Now, as the 100th anniversary of the Armistice approaches, photographs of the U.S. military training in France have recently been discovered at a library in the U.K., giving Americans a rare glimpse into history.\n\nThe century-old photographs, which were originally featured on popular British wartime magazine War Illustrated, are now on display at the USS Texas Museum.\n\n\u201cThe collection of images provides a fascinating new perspective into America\u2019s involvement in the First World War,\" Jonathan Rayner, a professor at England's University of Sheffield Library \u2013 where the magazine covers were first found \u2013 told SWNS. \u201cIt features images and illustrations that accompanied reports by journalists who were reporting from the battlefields and seas across Europe for people who were back home in Britain.\"\n\nWORLD WAR I POSTERS OFFER UNIQUE GLIMPSE INTO SOLDIERS' STORIES 100 YEARS AFTER THE ARMISTICE\n\nWar Illustrated was widely read in Britain in the early 1900s, sharing stories from the trenches, quite literally.\n\n\u201cIn its early days it was sensationalist and patriotic in nature, but it became a more reliable and respected source of journalism with personal accounts of the war from its correspondents who were often on the frontline,\" Rayner said. \u201cIt also published descriptions and illustrations to report events from the battlefield and ran comment pieces from writers and politicians reflecting on wartime events.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Britain had one of the largest naval forces in the world, SWNS reports, though they still needed assistance. And the U.S. delivered \u2014 more than 1 million American soldiers fought on the Western Front.\n\nTHIS BULLET-SCARRED BIBLE \u2018SAVED THE LIFE\u2019 OF A WORLD WAR I SOLDIER\n\nRayner credited the U.S. Navy with helping defend trade and keep an eye out for enemy ships.\n\n\u201cIn the First World War, both sides expected battle fleet engagements to decide not only control of the sea, but the entire war,\" Rayner said.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Navy\u2019s ships operated alongside British ships for a year without ever getting chance to engage the German fleet,\" Rayner added. \"Nonetheless, a close friendship grew between the US and Royal Navies from this co-operation.\n\nIf you look closely at the magazine covers, you can see the USS Parker, USS Banham, the USS Delaware, then known as a \"monster\" of the Navy, SWNS points out.\n\nMore than 17 million people, military and civilian, lost their lives in World War I. The U.S, which entered the war on April 6, 1917, lost more than 116,000 service members in the conflict.\n\nFox News' James Rogers contributed to this report.", "President Trump touched down in France on Friday and immediately took a shot at President Emmanuel Macron for his recent call for a \"European army,\" calling the idea \"very insulting\" and renewing pressure on the country to contribute more to NATO.\n\n\"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump tweeted. \"Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nTrump was reacting to remarks Macron made earlier this week when he said Europe was \u201cthe main victim\u201d of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.\n\n\u201cWe will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army,\u201d Macron said, according to The Wall Street Journal. He also grouped in the U.S. with the countries from which France needed protecting.\n\n\u201cWe have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\u201d he said on French radio.\n\nTrump is in France to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, where he will join fellow world leaders and have a one-on-one meeting with Macron -- who is facing political turmoil at home and as a result may take a tougher stance toward the president than previous meetings.\n\nMacron met with Trump on American soil in April, in a meeting filled with public hand-holding, smiles and affection. Macron, who called Trump \u201ccher Donald\u201d (\u201cDear Donald\u201d) engaged in an awkward fist-bump with, before being the recipient of a kiss from, the U.S. president.\n\n\u201cWe have to make him perfect,\u201d Trump said later, after brushing \"dandruff\" off the dashing centrist\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHe is perfect.\u201d\n\nTRUMP, MACRON SHARE ANOTHER AWKWARD HANDSHAKE\n\nBut there were signs even in April that things were not perfect between the two. Trump is the de facto leader of Western nationalism, while Macron has cast himself as the leading international proponent of European globalism. In an address to Congress, he called for the preservation of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate deal -- from which the U.S. withdrew at Trump's direction.\n\nAt the United Nations in September, the Frenchman took a swipe at Trump\u2019s brand of nationalism, criticizing a unilateralist approach that entails \"a certain lawlessness where everyone pursues their own interests.\"\n\n\u201cI will never stop upholding the principle of sovereignty even in the face of a certain nationalism, which we\u2019re seeing today, brandishing sovereignty as a way of attacking others,\" he said just hours after Trump addressed the General Assembly.\n\nThe spat over the European army indicates that relations could be deteriorating further.\n\nMACRON POPULARITY PLUMMETS AT HOME AS HE PUSHES GLOBALISM ON WORLD STAGE\n\nTrump has often complained about the burden placed on the U.S. from NATO obligations, noting that the U.S. has an enormous military budget, part of which is spent covering protecting allies abroad -- including in Europe. In July, he complained, \"We're protecting Germany, we're protecting France. We're protecting everybody. And yet we're paying a lot of money to protect.\"\n\nNATO itself does not have a defense budget, but members commit to spending a minimum of 2 percent of their Gross Domestic Product to defense spending -- although a number of countries do not meet this commitment. For 2018, the U.S. is spending 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense spending. Meanwhile France is spending 1.81 percent, and only a handful of NATO countries are meeting that 2 percent commitment.\n\nAccording to NATO figures, total defense spending of all NATO members in 2017 was $917 billion, and the U.S. spent about $618 billion, meaning the U.S. spent approximately 70 percent of all NATO members. However, that figure was for all U.S. defense spending, not contributions to NATO. The U.S. also pays for approximately 22 percent of NATO's common funding.\n\nBut Trump's unhappiness with the comments are likely in part because Macron lumped in the U.S. with traditional European foes in his justification.\n\nFormer U.K. Independence Party leader Nigel Farage told Fox Business\u2019 Stuart Varney earlier Friday that the army was a sign of Macron was a \u201cEurofanatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Macron to do it just a few days before President Trump goes to commemorate the centenary of the end of the Great War, the First World War, I think was absolutely crass in the extreme,\u201d Farage, a Fox News contributor, said. \u201cMaybe you can see now why his poll ratings are collapsing in France.\u201d\n\nThe idea of some sort of European army has been mulled on the continent for decades in various forms. However, it is unlikely to see support from a number of countries. Italy is currently going through a nationalist and Eurosceptic resurgence. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing pressure from nationalists in her country, while Britain is leaving the European Union.\n\nBut while Macron's idea may be somewhat extreme and premature, it may also reflect the political difficulties he faces at home. His approval ratings have dived as low as 29 percent as he faces accusations of being out of touch, and struggles to deal with domestic economic problems and the repercussions of the 2015 migration crisis.\n\nA number of politically awkward viral moments -- including him recently lecturing an out-of-work gardener to look harder for a job -- have not helped.\n\nBut Macron has brushed off concerns about lagging poll numbers. In a recent interview with Bloomberg News, he noted that unlike Trump he does not yet have to worry about poll numbers.\n\n\"I have a big advantage, I don\u2019t have any midterms elections. So I am not driven by polls,\" Macron said. \u201cI have to reform the country in depth. We will keep exactly the same pace.\u201d\n\nDespite the possible tensions between the two, Trump appeared confident of the trip.\n\n\u201cIt should be beautiful,\u201d he told reporters before departing Friday.", "Legendary WWE superstar \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin revealed on his podcast he\u2019s given up one of the things that helped make him one of the top stars in the business \u2013 alcohol.\n\nAustin said Thursday on his \u201cSteve Austin Show\u201d podcast that he is sticking to a new healthy diet and he hasn\u2019t had a drop of alcohol in two weeks.\n\n\u201cMy eating program is going fantastic.

He admitted that \u201cdope was never my thing\u201d in the past.\n\nHe told a story about how he and his wife drove from California to Texas and ended up at a police checkpoint. Austin said it made him paranoid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking, \u2018man, here I am, retired from the wrestling business, a global icon and a national treasure, and I\u2019m about to get busted for f-----g one joint because I wanted to try out a god d--n marijuana cigarette, so I could get away from the booze,\u2019\u201d Austin said.\n\nHe said they were waved through the checkpoint, but when he started to smoke the joint he said it didn\u2019t live up to the hype.", "A state judge on Friday sided with Florida Republican Rick Scott in ordering that Republicans be granted \u201cimmediate\u201d access to requested information about ballots in Broward County, amid explosive lawsuits against the county\u2019s top election official.\n\nIn their lawsuit against Broward, Scott \u2013 the Republican gubernatorial incumbent narrowly leading in the state's race for a U.S. Senate seat -- and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) allege that officials there are hiding critical information about the number of votes cast and counted.\n\nIn an emergency court hearing on Friday afternoon, state Judge Carol-Lisa Phillips ruled there has \u201cbeen a violation of the Florida constitution,\u201d as well as the state\u2019s public records act, by not turning over requested records.\n\nPhillips ordered Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes to allow for the \u201cimmediate inspection\u201d and \u201cphotocopying\u201d of the requested records no later than 7 p.m. Friday.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that the Broward Supervisor of Elections is being held accountable for this unethical failure,\" said Chris Hartline, a spokesman for Scott. \"Bill Nelson and his rag tag group of liberal lawyers from D.C. keep trying to steal this election, but they won\u2019t get away with it.\"\n\nScott is running against longtime incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. On Thursday, a Nelson spokesperson tersely dismissed Scott's effort: \u201cThe goal here is to see that all the votes in Florida are counted and counted accurately. Rick Scott\u2019s action appears to be politically motivated and borne out of desperation.\u201d\n\nIt comes as Scott has warned of possibly \u201crampant fraud,\u201d two heavily Democratic counties continue to report new votes, and three top races in the state appear headed for recounts. Fox News confirmed Friday that an unknown number of \u201cbags\u201d of uncounted early vote ballots have been found in Broward County. It is less than 100 ballots total, but officials did not give a precise number.\n\nScott's emergency complaint accused Snipes, the Broward County supervisor of elections, of being \"unwilling to disclose records revealing how many electors voted, how many ballots have been canvassed, and how many ballots remain to be canvassed,\" and charges that the uncertainty \"raises substantial concerns about the validity of the election process.\"\n\nPresident Trump himself has gone after Snipes, telling reporters Friday, \u201cShe has had a horrible history \u2026 and all of a sudden they\u2019re finding votes out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nAnd one conservative congressman in Florida has taken matters a step further, calling for Snipes\u2019 removal.\n\n\u201cThe outrageous ballot-counting issues in Broward County are un-American and unacceptable,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz said in a statement. \u201cI call on Governor Scott to immediately suspend Brenda Snipes, Supervisor of Elections for Broward County.

We have to win it twice now in the courts.\u201d\n\nReferring to himself as the state\u2019s senator-elect, he voiced disbelief at the sheer number of votes discovered in Broward County since election night: \u201cHow do you come up with 78,000 more votes in one county? \u2026 The Democrats are trying to steal this seat.\u201d\n\nIn a parallel suit against Palm Beach County, Scott and the NRSC charge that the election supervisor there illegally used her own judgment to determine voter intent when reviewing damaged or incorrectly filled-out absentee ballots, while refusing to allow impartial witnesses to monitor the process.\n\nScott's complaint against Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher alleges first that officials there illegally refused to allow Republicans, or any witnesses, to monitor the county's handling of damaged absentee ballots.\n\n\"Even more alarmingly,\" Scott claims, Bucher \"failed to allow the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board\" to determine, as required by law, which damaged or improperly filled-out absentee ballots were valid and how the voters of those ballots had intended to vote. Instead, Scott and the NRSC argue, Bucher and her staff simply used their own judgment when determining voters' intent.\n\nThe suit against Bucher demands an injunction requiring Bucher to make and compare duplicate copies of all damaged absentee ballots in the presence of Scott's representatives, and to allow the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board to determine voters' intent when counting those ballots.\n\nDemocrats are being represented in Florida by lawyer Marc Elias \u2013 known for his role in the Trump dossier controversy \u2013 who also announced a lawsuit Friday on behalf of Nelson over vote-by-mail ballots. Trump took aim at Elias in a tweet Friday.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Don\u2019t worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\u201d Trump said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Ivonne Amor and Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "Sri Lanka's president dissolved Parliament and called for elections on Jan. 5 in a bid to stave off a deepening political crisis over his dismissal of the prime minister that opponents say is unconstitutional.\n\nAn official notification signed by President Maithripala Sirisena announced the dissolution of Parliament effective midnight Friday. It said the names of candidates will be called before Nov. 26 and the new Parliament is to convene Jan. 17.\n\nSri Lanka has been in a crisis since Oct. 26, when Sirisena fired his prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and replaced him with former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa. Both say they command a majority in Parliament and had been expected to face the 225-member house on Wednesday after it was suspended for about 19 days.\n\nForeign Minister Sarath Amunugama told The Associated Press on Saturday that the reason for the president to dissolve Parliament was the need to go to the people to find a resolution to the crisis.\n\n\"On the 14th there was to be a lot of commotion and unparliamentary activities sponsored by the speaker,\" Amunugama said. \"The speaker was not planning to act according to the constitution and standing orders of Parliament.\"\n\nSirisena's supporters had been irked by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya's announcement that he was going to call for a vote for either party to prove their support.\n\n\"The dissolution clearly indicates that Mr. Sirisena has grossly misjudged and miscalculated the support that he might or could secure to demonstrate support in the Parliament,\" said Bharath Gopalaswamy, director at U.S.-based analyst group Atlantic Council's South Asia Center. \"At the end of the day, he is a victim of his own homegrown crisis.\"\n\nWickremesinghe has insisted his firing is unconstitutional. He has refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned immediately to prove he had support among its members.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009. Rajapaksa, who ruled as president from 2005 to 2015, is credited as a hero by the ethnic Sinhalese majority for winning the conflict. But he lost a re-election bid in 2015 amid accusations of nepotism, corruption and wartime atrocities.\n\nWickremesinghe's camp is likely to contest Sirisena's move because of constitutional provisions stating a Parliament can't be dissolved until 4 \u00bd years after its election. The current Parliament was elected in August 2015.\n\n\"It's totally unconstitutional,\" said Harsha de Silva, a member of Wickremesinghe's United National Party and a former minister. \"Sirisena has relegated the constitution to toilet paper. We will fight this dictator to the end.\"\n\nThe party said in a Twitter message that it will meet the elections commissioner to discuss the constitutionality of Sirisena's move.\n\nThe U.S. State Department tweeted that it is deeply concerned by news the Sri Lanka Parliament will be dissolved, \"further deepening the political crisis.\"\n\n\"As a committed partner of Sri Lanka, we believe democratic institutions and processes need to be respected to ensure stability and prosperity,\" the statement said.\n\nEarlier, U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and two other lawmakers wrote to Sirisena warning that actions circumventing the democratic process could impact U.S. assistance \u2014 including a planned five-year aid package from the Millennium Challenge Corporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\"We fear that recent actions, if not corrected, will threaten your country's democratic development and derail the progress made in recent years,\" the three lawmakers said in a letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nRajapaksa indicated what was coming hours before the dissolution in a speech. He said the government must go to the people for confirmation on whether the president made the correct decision when he appointed him as prime minister.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Krishan Francis in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Emily Schmall in New Delhi, India, and Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report.", "Months after terrorizing a Florida family with young children and evading capture, an escaped Asian water monitor lizard that was \u201cterrifying to look at\u201d has officially been apprehended, state wildlife officials announced this week.\n\nThe lizard \u2014 which officials with the Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said measured more than 8 feet in length \u2014 was seized Tuesday, ending the animal\u2019s nearly 3-month tyranny in a Davie neighborhood.\n\nFLORIDA MAN CAPTURES \u2018MAMMOTH\u2019 17-FOOT PYTHON, SETS RECORD\n\nThe lizard was first spotted by Zachary Lieberman on a horse trail behind his family\u2019s home in August.

It\u2019s a message worth sharing.\n\nDear Trey, Sarah Camille, and Jackson,\n\nIt is important for you to understand what Veterans Day means and the role our military veterans have played to give us this land we call America.\n\nVeterans Day is a day for all of us as Americans to honor our men and women who have served in the U.S. armed forces. While Memorial Day honors those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country when in uniform, Veterans Day is different. It celebrates the service of all of America\u2019s military veterans.\n\nThose who have served in our military since our nation\u2019s founding have been on the front lines to keep America safe and secure so that we can be free.\n\nActually, a number of your ancestors were some of America\u2019s first veterans and wore the uniform during the American Revolutionary War to give us our independence. In fact, several were among the Scots-Irish and French Huguenots of the backwoods of South Carolina who came together at the Battle of Cowpens to turn the tide in America\u2019s favor.\n\nThis Veterans Day, it\u2019s important to understand that the reason we even have a federal government and the reason the states came together in the first place was to \u201cprovide for the common defense\u201d of the American people.\n\nAlways remember that is the primary purpose of our government. And it is American men and women who have worn the uniform \u2013 our veterans \u2013 who have kept us safe and provided for that common defense.\n\nWhen John F. Kennedy was president, some 52 percent of all federal spending was for national security. Today it is only about 16 percent. So when you hear so-called \u201cexperts\u201d say we spend too much on defense and taking care of our veterans, they really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nMany of our veterans have health and medical problems because of their selfless service to our country. Whether it\u2019s a vet who is an amputee, or one who is suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), it\u2019s important that we help them and never forget what they have done for our country.\n\nIn addition to the role our government plays, it\u2019s great to see private citizens \u2013 who exemplify the American volunteer spirit \u2013 get involved to help our veterans.\n\nLook at Ben Patton, Army Gen. George S. Patton\u2019s grandson. His Patton Veterans Project has helped many of our vets dealing with PTSD.\n\nThen there\u2019s Michael Reagan, President Reagan\u2019s son, with the Reagan Legacy Foundation. The foundation has done a great job to honor our WWII veterans and provide scholarships for the crew and families of those deployed on the USS Ronald Reagan.\n\nI am concerned that many of your generation don\u2019t understand what it really means to be an American and don\u2019t have an appreciation of what our veterans have done over the years for our country.\n\nUnfortunately, we don\u2019t emphasize American history and civics in our schools like we used to. A recent study found that 22 percent of millennials weren\u2019t sure if they knew what the Holocaust was. And 67 percent had not heard of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp where more than 1 million Jews and others were murdered.\n\nEducation is a national security issue and right now we\u2019ve got a real problem.\n\nPresident Reagan reminded us that \u201cfreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.\u201d He went on to say: \u201cWe didn\u2019t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children\u2019s children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.\u201d\n\nGod has blessed America over the years by giving us men and women who put America above self, put on the uniform, and are willing to give their lives for their country. Today we live in a free country and are safe because of our veterans.\n\nThis Veterans Day, honor our veterans, go to a Veterans Day parade and bring your friends. And tell them what it means to be an American and what our veterans have done for them. Most importantly, thank God for giving us men and women such as these. This is the way to honor our veterans on Veterans Day.", "A major gaming studio has gambled big-time on a new western, and it's paying off, launching a billion-dollar baby just in time for the holidays.\n\nRockstar Games is an industry heavyweight best known for the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series.

In its first week, it made more than a billion dollars, proving there's an appetite for gamers who want to go back to the future for their entertainment.\n\nFOX ON TECH: VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS AND 911\n\n\"Red Dead Redemption 2\" is being described as a big leap forward for the genre, an epic Western with serious themes and dramatic undertones. It follows a main character, Arthur Morgan, as he navigates life in a gang in the waning days of the wild west, and players get to see what happens to outlaw culture as the west was won.\n\nWhile the numbers for \"Red Dead Redemption 2\" are impressive, it isn't Rockstar's best-selling game of all-time. That record belongs to \"Grand Theft Auto 5.\" According to Rockstar's parent company Take Two, GTA5 reached the billion-dollar milestone after only three days in stores. And while the studio isn't likely to stray far from that formula anytime soon, it does acknowledge that the success of \"Redemption 2\" shows there's an appetite for more in-depth storytelling with historical settings. So don't be surprised if you see other westerns or similarly \"serious\" themed games coming from Rockstar in the near future.", "Tents of sticky spider webs are covering the side of an Arkansas highway \u2014 and thousands of \"creepy crawlers\" are beginning to emerge.\n\nArkansas native Zach Riggs was traveling along Highway 230 outside of Bono city in Craighead County when he stopped to take pictures and videos of the shocking scene.\n\n\"Anybody need some spiders?\" he asked in a Facebook post this week.\n\nTENNESSEE WOMAN BITTEN BY BROWN RECLUSE SPIDER ALLEGEDLY FINDS DOZENS MORE IN APARTMENT\n\nNearly 10,000 people have watched Riggs' 40-second footage, which shows what is believed to be Tetragnatha spiders \u2014 known as \"stretch spiders\" for their long bodies \u2014 covering road signs, construction equipment and traveling across giant webs almost completely covering a portion of the road like a \"thick carpet.\"\n\nTetragnatha spiders aren't uncommon. There are hundreds of species of these spiders that live in various parts of the world.\n\nWildlife experts say it's typical for spiders to build massive nests for mating, especially if it's hot or humid. The weather in Bono has been full of moisture in recent weeks, thanks to several storms that have swept through the area, Accuweather reports.\n\nLocals were terrified by the sight and jokingly vowed to steer clear of Highway 230 for the time being.\n\n\"I live in Bono and don\u2019t approve of this!!!!!

Last September, CNN reported that he accompanied John Podesta, the former Clinton campaign chairman, to a closed-door interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee to answer questions about Fusion GPS.\n\nLast month, Fox News reported that Michael Sussman, another Perkins Coie lawyer working with the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign, contacted FBI general counsel James Baker in late 2016 and provided documents for the Russia probe as federal investigators prepared a surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\n\nSussmann\u2019s contact with Baker suggests another connection between the early stages of the FBI\u2019s Russia probe and those working with the DNC and Clinton campaign, according to the report.\n\nElias has now returned to the public eye to represent the Democrats in their Florida battle.\n\nSpeaking Thursday night, outgoing Florida Gov.

These included Al Franken's Senate victory in Minnesota in 2008, where he won by 225 votes, one of the closest races in history.\n\nScott said Elias has argued that recounts only really happen when the number of votes separating the candidates are in their dozens or hundreds.\n\n\u2018Now he\u2019s down here to try to steal the election and to try to thwart the will of the voters of Florida,\u201d Scott said Thursday.\n\nTRUMP SNARKS 'BLAME THE RUSSIANS' OVER SLOW VOTE COUNT IN FLORIDA, GEORGIA\n\nElias responded to Scott on Twitter.\n\n\u201cRick Scott just attacked me as a lawyer from Washington D.C. as he announced a lawsuit literally in the name of the national Republican Party located in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Elias said. \u201cPro tip: when you are attacking the other side\u2019s lawyers, you are losing.\u201d\n\nAn email from Fox News seeking comment on Trump\u2019s tweet was not immediately returned.\n\nA Perkins Coie spokesperson told Fox News that Sussmann\u2019s contact with Baker was not connected to the firm\u2019s representation of the DNC or Clinton campaign.", "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 More than a decade before the Nazis seized power in Germany, Albert Einstein was on the run and already fearful for his country's future, according to a newly revealed handwritten letter.\n\nHis longtime friend and fellow Jew, German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, had just been assassinated by right-wing extremists and police had warned the noted physicist that his life could be in danger too.\n\nSo Einstein fled Berlin and went into hiding in northern Germany. It was during this hiatus that he penned a handwritten letter to his beloved younger sister, Maja, warning of the dangers of growing nationalism and anti-Semitism years before the Nazis ultimately rose to power, forcing Einstein to flee his native Germany for good.\n\n\"Out here, nobody knows where I am, and I'm believed to be away on a trip,\" he wrote in August 1922. \"Here are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I'm happy to be able to get away from everything.\"\n\nThe previously unknown letter, brought forward by an anonymous collector, is set to go on auction next week in Jerusalem with an opening asking price of $12,000.\n\nAs the most influential scientist of the 20th century, Einstein's life and writings have been thoroughly researched. The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which Einstein was a founder, houses the world's largest collection of Einstein material. Together with the California Institute of Technology it runs the Einstein Papers Project. Individual auctions of his personal letters have brought in substantial sums in recent years.\n\nThe 1922 letter shows he was concerned about Germany's future a full year before the Nazis even attempted their first coup \u2014 the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch to seize power in Bavaria.\n\n\"This letter reveals to us the thoughts that were running through Einstein's mind and heart at a very preliminary stage of Nazi terror,\" said Meron Eren, co-owner of the Kedem Auction House in Jerusalem, which obtained the letter and offered The Associated Press a glimpse before the public sale. \"The relationship between Albert and Maja was very special and close, which adds another dimension to Einstein the man and greater authenticity to his writings.\"\n\nThe letter, which bears no return address, is presumed to have been written while he was staying in the port city of Kiel before embarking on a lengthy speaking tour across Asia.\n\n\"I'm doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues. I'm very reclusive here, without noise and without unpleasant feelings, and am earning my money mainly independent of the state, so that I'm really a free man,\" he wrote. \"You see, I am about to become some kind of itinerant preacher. That is, firstly, pleasant and, secondly, necessary.\"\n\nAddressing his sister's concerns, Einstein writes: \"Don't worry about me, I myself don't worry either, even if it's not quite kosher, people are very upset. In Italy, it seems to be at least as bad.\"\n\nLater in 1922, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nZe'ev Rosenkranz, the assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech, said the letter wasn't the first time Einstein warned about German anti-Semitism, but it captured his state of mind at this important junction after Rathenau's killing and the \"internal exile\" he imposed on himself shortly after it.\n\n\"Einstein's initial reaction was one of panic and a desire to leave Germany for good. Within a week, he had changed his mind,\" he said. \"The letter reveals a mindset rather typical of Einstein in which he claims to be impervious to external pressures. One reason may be to assuage his sister's concerns. Another is that he didn't like to admit that he was stressed about external factors.\"\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power and began enacting legislation against Jews, they also aimed to purge Jewish scientists. The Nazis dismissed Einstein's groundbreaking work, including his Law of Relativity, as \"Jewish Physics.\"\n\nEinstein renounced his German citizenship in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor. The physicist settled in the United States, where he would remain until his death in 1955.\n\nEinstein declined an invitation to serve as the first president of the newly established state of Israel but left behind his literary estate and personal papers to the Hebrew University.", "As the 50th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 mission gets closer, a U.S. flag that flew to the Moon during the mission sold at auction for an out-of-this-world sum: $62,500.\n\nThe flag is mounted to an official NASA certificate that reads \"''This flag traveled to the Moon with Apollo 11, the first manned lunar landing, July 20, 1969,\" according to Nate D.

The rampage ended only after Long killed himself.\n\nOfficials have suggested post-traumatic stress disorder may have been a factor for the former Marine, who had served in a hellish area of Afghanistan at a particularly brutal time in the war. But authorities also said the 28-year-old had been \"cleared\" by a mental health professional just months earlier after a disturbance incident.\n\n\"He was somewhat irate. Acting a little irrationally,\" Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said Thursday, talking about officers' earlier interaction with Long. \"They felt he might be suffering from PTSD, the fact he was a veteran.\"\n\nBut investigators are unlikely to quickly reveal a definitive motive for the massacre, and authorities are still unraveling Long\u2019s background \u2013 including his nearly five-year stint with the Marines.\n\nLong joined the military in August 2008 at the age of 18. Less than a year later, he married in Honolulu, according to military and court records.\n\nPart of the infantry, Long was responsible for hauling and shooting machine guns until he was honorably discharged with the rank of corporal in 2013, the Pentagon said.\n\nCALIFORNIA BAR GUNMAN ID'D AS IAN DAVID LONG, 28: EVERYTHING WE KNOW SO FAR\n\nWhile in the Marines, Long was deployed once \u2013 to the Afghan province of Helmand \u2013 with Golf Company, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment from November 2010 to June 2011.\n\nThe Marine Corps told The New York Times the 1,000-person battalion saw little action compared with others in the province, which saw much of the deadliest fighting in the region from 2010 to 2012. The only casualty that occurred in Long's battalion died in a suicide, allegedly after being hazed by other Marines, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cIt was fairly quiet,\u201d Jeremy Soliz, who was part of the deployment, told the newspaper. \u201cWe were warriors, but we acted more like policemen.

Between 90,000 and 100,000 U.S. troops were on the ground at the time.\n\nA month before his arrival to Helmand, Marines on the ground faced daily attacks \u2013 especially in Sangin, which is considered the bloodiest battleground in Afghanistan.

Harley-Davidson rider. Shirtless cowboy. Artful piano impressario. One of the world\u2019s richest men. Former spy master. Gun-toting fisherman. Black belt in Judo. Accomplished hockey player. Twice voted the world's most powerful man by Forbes magazine.\n\nThen there are the not-so-positive images: Controller of a dastardly spy service that kills off dissidents. Accused disrupter of the 2016 Presidential elections. Consistently late to high-profile meetings. Kleptocrat and oligarch.\n\nOpinions of him abound, but on this much there's agreement: The 66-year-old Russian president is a man of many faces, mysteries - and myths.\n\n\u201cPutin scuba dives in three feet of water only to discover ancient buried amphora, or wrestles a rare tiger, or leading \u2018bird migration\u2019 from a biplane,\u201d said Natalia Arno, president of the Free Russia Foundation, a non-profit, U.S.-based diaspora organization. \u201cBut the younger generation is seeing through this. Putin is losing popularity among Russian youth who sees his shirtless wrestler stunt as a joke.\u201d\n\nOther experts disagree.\n\n\u201cRussians trust Putin. This surprises most Americans \u2013 no one in Russia sees him as \u201ca fool.\u201d He is not mercurial, nor is he confused. He says what he means,\u201d asserted Geoff Hellman, Chairman & CEO of the Economic Policy Forum. \u201cHe is highly respected within his own country.\u201d\n\nSo just who is the man at the heart of so many headlines, questions, conspiracies, and crises?\n\nBorn on Oct. 7, 1952, in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) to a factory foreman mother and Soviet sailor father, the staunchly Orthodox Christian Putin studied law at Leningrad State University before serving 15 years as a foreign intelligence officer for the KGB, otherwise known as the Committee for State Security. He climbed to the rank of lieutenant colonel before retiring in 1990, just before the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cAs a former KGB agent, Putin sees the world through a prism of threats,\u201d Arno contended. \u201cHe prioritizes intelligence and military means over other instruments of foreign policy.\u201d\n\nBy 1994, he had ascended to become the first deputy mayor of St. Petersburg \u2013 Russia\u2019s second largest city \u2013 before moving to Moscow in 1996, where he joined the presidential staff as deputy to the Kremlin\u2019s chief administrator, Pavel Bordodin.\n\nTwo years later, then-President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin as director of the KGB\u2019s internal replacement \u2013 the Federal Security Service (FSB) \u2013 and the following year delegated him as his prime minister. On December 1991, Yeltsin suddenly pronounced he was stepping down, after fatiguing the Russian public with his unstable conduct and apparent alcoholism \u2013 making the seemingly cool, quietly confident and collected Putin his successor.\n\nAfter chaperoning a growing economy in the aftermath of a protracted recession in the 1990s, he swept to re-election in 2004. Despite a constitutional provision that compelled him to instead take the role of prime minister after selecting Dmitry Medvedev as president, Putin effectively still ran the show. The two then traded positions again, with Putin returning to the presidency.\n\nPutin has two daughters - Yekaterina, a 32-year-old acrobatic dancer, and Maryia, a 33-year-old biomedical scientist. Both are children of his ex-wife and former flight attendant, Lyudmila. The couple announced their divorce after 31 years of marriage during an interview \u2013 which many contend was staged \u2013 while leaving the ballet at the Grand Kremlin Palace.\n\nMysteries have consistently swirled over \u201cother\u201d alleged Putin children not publicly known. He has also long been romantically linked to retired Gold Medalist and former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, now 35, and a film star and politician herself.\n\nCRIMEA UNDER RUSSIA: LOCALS FEAR MORE MAYHEM IF FORCED TO RETURN TO UKRAINE\n\nIRANIAN WOMEN DEFY 'TERRORIST' LABEL, CONTINUE THEIR OPPOSITION TO REGIME\n\nPutin earned the wrath of much of the international community in 2014, when Russian-backed troops methodically took control of Crimea, a Ukrainian autonomous republic that is mostly ethnic Russian. That ignited a firestorm, and a tough international sanctions. Important assets held by members of Putin\u2019s tight circle were seized.\n\nBut none of that seemed to dim his enthusiasm to project an oversized public persona.\n\n\u201cHe is the embodiment of powerful Russia. Does sports, and likes to use rough language and project power. After a period of instability and economic downfall of the 90s, it makes sense that people allocate all the positive traits of current reality to Putin,\u201d said Roman Kiselyov-Augustus, a Moscow-based political scientist. \u201cBut I believe he has reached the point where he identifies himself with the state. His interests are the interests of the state, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nMany analysts contend that were it not for Putin\u2019s decision to intervene in the Syria Civil War in 2016 \u2013 backing the regime led by Bashar al-Assad \u2013 the government there would have fallen. Instead, the Assad regime has essentially defeated the rebels, and taken back most of the country - all while Russia\u2019s entanglement undermines efforts by Western governments to support the Syrian rebels.\n\nBut while Putin's Syrian intervention makes the headlines in the West, that's not so much the case with state-run media back in Russia.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t care much about the war. The actual losses are hidden, and there isn\u2019t much to react on,\u201d noted Kiselyov-Augustus.\n\nPutin in March won a fourth presidential term \u2013 after the most prominent opposition figure, Alexey Navalny, was banned from running. He was later imprisoned for attending an \u201cunsanctioned protest\u201d in Moscow, which he denied.\n\nWhat this all means for the future of U.S.-Russia relations remains murky - even considering the expected forthcoming report by former FBI Director Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation on Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Putin has staunchly denied any Russian interference in the campaign, despite what is seen as overwhelming evidence to the contrary by U.S intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThen there is the matter of nuclear arms control, more of an issue now since Trump pulled the United States out of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). Trump made the move in response to allegations Russia is developing weapons systems that violate the treaty, which prohibits land-based cruise and ballistic missiles with an immediate range between 310 and 3410 miles.\n\nWhile Trump has used the move as a rallying cry for the U.S. to upgrade its weapons systems, Putin, too, has set out to reform what he views as antiquated, conscript-based army in recent years. Russia now spends a higher portion of its GDP on defense than the United States.\n\n\u201cThey have a lot of topics to discuss with regard to bilateral ties and regional issues \u2013 starting with treaty withdrawal and finishing with Iran, Syria and the JCPOA,\u201d said Alexey Khlebnikov, an expert at Moscow\u2019s Russian International Affairs Council, referring to the Iran Deal - which the U.S. exited earlier this year, while re-imposing sanctions on Iran. \u201cBoth are interested in striking certain deals which could be sold to the domestic audience as a victory and could improve ratings and public support. However, it seems hard to achieve.\u201d\n\nBut what does Putin ultimately want from Trump?\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, he wants to demonstrate through contact with Trump, both within Russia and outside Russia, that he plays an important role in the world politics,\u201d said Vitali Shkliarov, a Russia-U.S. political analyst. \u201cHe wants to be taken seriously.\n\n\"Secondly, Putin is sincerely convinced that the American system of governance is the same as the Russian. Therefore, if he comes to an agreement, with Trump he will come to an agreement with all of America.\u201d", "Ashton Kutcher revealed how the mass shooting at the Borderline bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif. on Thursday personally affected him.\n\nThe former \"That's 70's Show\" actor, who is married to actress Mila Kunis, explained on Twitter how he was impacted by the shooting, which took the lives of at least 12 people.\n\n\"My wife threw me a birthday party this year at the Borderline,\u201d Kutcher wore in a tweet. \"Only reason we are alive is the shooter chose a different night.

In a separate tweet, the 40-year-old went on to tag Ivanka Trump telling her that her brother-in-law attended Kutcher's party.\n\n\"your brother in law was at that birthday party. He could have just as easily been a victim. You go to synagogues you could be a victim! Talk to your dad! Plead with your dad! Let this be your legacy! Gun Reform now!\"\n\nThe actor was seemingly referring to Joshua Kushner, the brother of Ivanka's husband Jared.\n\nKutcher also clarified that as someone who grew up hunting, and once worked in a gun club, he is not advocating to take people's guns away, but he is asking for stricter gun laws. He then added that the idea of arming more people to protect people made no sense.\n\n\"The BS rhetoric around arming more people to protect others is just that, BS! Armed people got killed last night!

The unit has been launched amid allegations by human rights groups and the public that police killed 22 suspects in the last two weeks in a low-income area of Nairobi.\n\nRights groups have for years claimed that Kenya's police force is riddled with corruption and carries out abuses.\n\nEric Kiraithe, a former police spokesman who is now the government spokesman admitted that corruption in the force saying it \"runs deep and wide.\"\n\nThe local chapter of the international anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International has for more than a decade ranked the Kenyan police as the most corrupt institution in a country where corruption is endemic.\n\nThe abuses have continued despite an exercise in which all 100,000 officers are being scrutinized, rights advocates say. Some 2,000 officers have been fired out of around 50,000 scrutinized as the exercise which started in December 2013 and is continuing.\n\nWhen that investigation began, body parts from a person reported kidnapped were sent to the National Police Service Commission with a note warning the chairman to tread carefully.\n\nThe Independent Medico-Legal Unit, or IMLU, has conducted autopsies on the bodies of the 22 killed by police. \"Our preliminary investigations indicate that those were extrajudicial killings,\" said Peter Kiama, the executive director of the group. \"They were not done according to the law. The police were in a position to arrest and not kill those individuals.\"\n\nThe IMLU in 2014 documented how a majority of police killings at that time were connected to police extorting money from suspects and not police work. He said human rights defenders who raised concern about the killings are being threatened.\n\nKiama said the internal affairs unit can be effective if given independence and resources.\n\n\"This is a huge investment and the demonstration of political will is a plus,\" he said, adding that despite the challenges facing the new unit, \"there is justification for skepticism but there is space for optimism.\"", "On Wednesday, London police responded to separate stabbings within hours of each other, the victims, a young boy believed to be in his teens and a man, were sent to the hospital with life-threatening or serious stab wounds.\n\nThat makes two attacks this morning, five this week...and more than 39,000 in just six months.\n\nQuietly, a brutal, deadly knife attack epidemic is overwhelming residents and police forces throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nOf the five people stabbed this week, the youngest was 15-year-old Jay Hughes, who was attacked outside a chicken shop in broad daylight.\n\nDuring the first six months of the year, police recorded 39,332 knife crime offenses -- a 12 percent increase over last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Other violent crimes, including murder and robbery, also increased by double-digit percentages.\n\nData also showed the number of homicides in which a knife or sharp instrument was used increased by 25 percent in the last year, ONS said.\n\nCRITICS SLAM 'EMBARRASSING' MAYOR SADIQ KHAN FOR FEUDING WITH TRUMP WHILE LONDON FACES RISING CRIME, KNIFE DEATHS\n\nThere's little agreement about what's behind the surge in violent crime. Some point fingers at gangs and the sale of drugs; others blame recent mass migration -- with little or no vetting and few resources with which to care for the new populations -- that poured in from the Middle East, largely as a result of fighting in Syria; Yet another theory is that police resources are stretched due to a plummeting number of officers.\n\nEmbattled London Mayor Sadiq Khan warned Monday it could take a generation to solve London\u2019s violent crime problem.\n\nElsewhere, Home Secretary Sajid Javid reportedly called London\u2019s police commissioner demanding officers step up the response and get \u201cthe situation under control.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to make sure that police have the powers they need and the tools,\u201d Javid told The Daily Telegraph, adding he wants to sweep away bureaucracy and enhance police officer\u2019s ability to employ \u201cstop and search\u201d \u2013 the British version of the controversial \u201cstop and frisk\u201d tactic used in the United States.\n\nJavid said police have done \u201ca very good job\u201d in combating the rising crime rate, but \u201cthere\u2019s more we can do to help.\u201d\n\nUK LAWMAKER ON LONDON\u2019S MURDER SURGE: \u2018ENOUGH IS ENOUGH\u2019\n\nThe ONS said in its report last month that, while knife crime was \u201cconcentrated in London and other metropolitan areas,\u201d the majority of police forces across the United Kingdom also saw a rise to some degree.\n\nThe true tally of knife crimes is likely even higher than ONS' figure, given Greater Manchester Police data was excluded by ONS because a review of its figures found they undercounting offenses. If those figures were included, the total of knife or sharp instrument offenses across the U.K. would climb to 41,884.\n\nRichard Walton, the former head of the Metropolitan Police\u2019s counter-terrorism command, warned that police are on the cusp of losing control of the streets to violent criminals.\n\n\u201cViolence is indeed infectious but there is very little in place in our communities across the country now to stop it from spreading,\u201d he wrote in an article for The Telegraph. \u201cIt is ironic that at a time when policing leadership and culture is widely viewed as strong and reformed, policing is now simply holding the thin blue line, responding to crises and reacting to escalating levels of violence.\u201d\n\nLONDON MURDER RATE BEATS NEW YORK FOR MONTH AS STABBINGS SURGE\n\nThe government has denied any causal link between cuts to the police force and the increase in stabbings \u2013 instead claiming changes in the drug market and social media incitement were key drivers of violence, The Independent reported.\n\nExperts say what's unmistakable is that the victims and assailants in these crimes are growing younger. And doctors are also reporting an increase in the severity of the attacks, with many victims arriving at the hospital with multiple puncture wounds.\n\n\u201cPreviously we used to see one or two wounds per victim. Now we are frequently seeing multiple wounds, five or sometimes 10 stab injuries on a single patient,\u201d trauma and vascular surgeon Dr. Ross Davenport told The Guardian in August.\n\nCressida Dick, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London, told The Independent young people carrying knives are turning what once would have been an after-school fist fight into murder.\n\n\u201cSome young people are carrying a knife because they feel frightened of other young people, and then when they are angry or feel threatened they use the knife,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a commentary for the Evening Standard published Thursday, Dick said ending violence is her top priority.\n\n\u201cThe causes of the rise in violence are complex, and so are the solutions, but each and every one of my officers and staff, whether they are a firearms officer, a neighborhood officer or a call handler, know violence is our number-one priority and have this at the forefront of their minds whatever they are doing,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe added: \u201cOur work will continue, we will not stop or give up.

But the rise of these so-called \"virtual assistants\" isn't yet complete and they haven't yet been integrated into all walks of life; Alexa and Siri can do almost anything for you, but they've got one big drawback that could pose a danger to your family: the lack of a 911 feature.\n\nAlexa has become by far the most popular virtual assistant, with some estimates showing Amazon's signature tech gadget with more than 70 percent of the market, shared mostly with Google Home and Apple's Siri assistant. The media measurement company Comscore estimates there are some 20 million of the devices now in homes across the country. Alexa can tell you a joke, get your weather forecast, and play music; it seems like the one thing she can't do is call 911. Now home security experts are sounding the \"virtual\" alarm, saying this poses a danger, especially to folks who have come to rely on virtual assistants as part of their everyday routine and may be surprised to find they won't be able to rely on them in an emergency.\n\n21 CLEVER ALEXA COMMANDS YOU WILL USE AGAIN AND AGAIN\n\nThe roadblocks are mostly technical. Complications with software, especially a lack of real-time GPS data, have kept manufacturers from even allowing them to call emergency services, and there's been no attempt to configure an alternate mode of communication with authorities, like texting. But technical issues aren't the only thing stopping virtual assistants from calling 911 - there's also the money. The 911 emergency services surcharge can range from 25 cents all the way up to three dollars - you may have seen those charges on your phone bill - and those fees would need to be paid by either the device maker or the customer, something that could cost tech heavyweights like Amazon and Google billions of dollars a year.\n\nUltimately, while experts are pushing to make a 911 emergency feature standard on all virtual assistants, many also acknowledge that it's a symptom of a larger problem, requiring a larger solution: updating the entire 911 system. Many, if not most, call centers are still struggling with the technology needed to keep up as more of us are using cell phones to call or text for help. The good news is that both Apple and Google have stepped in to help bring the existing infrastructure up to date, which will hopefully make it easier for our smart speakers to reach emergency services when we need help.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nDennis Miller's new comedy special 'Fake News, Real Jokes!' is out, about and ready for your enjoyment!

But Macedonian police say more than 6,600 illegal crossings of the country's borders were recorded in the first half of 2018.\n\nPolice teams from several EU nations are helping their Macedonian peers to patrol the borders.\n\nMacedonia first declared a state of emergency at its border areas in August 2015 after tens of thousands of transient migrants illegally entered the country.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nSome 150 migrants will be transferred back to the Bosnian capital Sarajevo by bus after they were not allowed to get off a train in the northwest of the country, local authorities said Friday.\n\nThe migrants, who were seemingly looking to cross the border and get into European Union member Croatia, had spent hours stranded on the train in the town of Bihac.\n\nThe migrants arrived early Friday but the authorities in Bihac have been directing migrants to other areas in Bosnia, saying they cannot accommodate any more people. Last month, about 100 migrants who arrived on a train from Sarajevo, were also transferred back.\n\nBosnia has been struggling with the influx of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa or Asia.

Recent budget cuts by the West Bank-based administration of President Mahmoud Abbas have worsened the situation for Gaza's rulers, preventing them from paying complete salaries to their 40,000 employees.\n\nBut on Thursday, a Qatari envoy brought the money through Israel in three suitcases.

After the Midland, Texas, teenager did some of her own research, she realized that she was right. But that was just the beginning of her horrific cancer odyssey. Marler\u2019s doctors discovered that what she had was truly unlucky\u2014but she\u2019s still here to tell her tale.\n\nIn 2005, Marler noticed blood in her stool; she was mortified and too embarrassed to tell anyone. For two years she kept silent until her symptoms worsened. \u201cI looked up my symptoms and knew I had all the signs for colon cancer,\u201d she says. \u201cI freaked out but still couldn\u2019t tell my mom face-to-face, so I wrote her a letter, telling her I knew I had cancer. My mom thought I was overreacting, and even the doctor she took me to said it was constipation.\u201d When her symptoms persisted after a high-fiber diet, doctors performed an endoscopy and colonoscopy and confirmed what Marler had known all along: At 17, she had full-blown colon cancer. Learn the 6 silent signs of colon cancer you might be missing.\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up, my mom looked like she had just seen a ghost. The doctor who performed the tests was crying. She said she had never seen a case as bad as mine, and that I needed to get to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center immediately,\u201d Marler recalls. There she met with Miguel Rodriguez-Bigas, MD, FACS, FASCRS, who removed Marler\u2019s entire colon and almost all of her rectum\u2014leaving only enough to allow her to retain normal digestive function and to avoid having an ileostomy bag for life.\n\nBut just nine months later, the cancer returned. \u201cWhen my mom told me, I was cleaning my room. I just felt like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. I just want to be a normal kid.'\u201d\n\nAfter another surgery, three months of chemotherapy, and radiation, Marler believed that her cancer battles had to be over. Find out the 14 cancer warning signs your doctor should never ignore.\n\nThen, during a routine scan to ensure that she was still in remission five years later, 23-year-old Marler got the call she never thought she\u2019d get again. \u201cI was at work and the doctor called to tell me that the scan showed a spot in my uterus. A biopsy of the polyp revealed it was endometrial cancer, and an aggressive one. We went back to MD Anderson to meet with Pedro T. Ramirez, MD, who recommended a full hysterectomy. \u201cLuckily, that time, the cancer was contained to the polyp, so I didn\u2019t need chemotherapy,\u201d she explains. Read these 21 reasons to feel hopeful about medicine\u2019s progress in fighting cancer.\n\nPuzzled by Marler\u2019s history, Dr. Rodriguez-Bigas recommended that she get genetic testing. The testing revealed the bad news: Marler had an incredibly rare disorder called CMMRD (constitutional mismatch repair deficiency\u2014it had just recently been identified by a researcher in Australia). Dr. Rodriguez-Bigas explained that the disorder predisposes a person to different cancers\u2014the body fails to repair the cell mutations that lead to cancer. Learn about these 37 ways to cut your cancer risk, according to science.\n\nBoth of her parents have Lynch syndrome, a mutation in a gene called PMS2 that leaves them highly susceptible to colon, endometrial, and other types of cancer. When Marler inherited two bad copies of the gene, it meant that she was extremely vulnerable to a variety of cancers. There is no treatment for the disorder, only preventive care\u2014primarily regular scans to catch any developing cancers early. Armed with an answer for the grief and suffering she had endured for the past decade of her life, Marler actually felt a sense of relief. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking, but at least I have an answer. Less than 100 people in the United States have it, and I\u2019m one of them.\u201d\n\nThree years later, Marler was unable to shake what she thought was a lingering sinus infection. \u201cI just keep coughing\u2014I felt awful. I was nauseated and running a high fever. The ER gave me medication for the nausea and advised me to take Tylenol for the fever.\u201d The next morning, Marler\u2019s mother knew something wasn\u2019t right when Marler refused to go back to the hospital because of the level of pain she felt. Check out these 30 steps you can take to help prevent cancer.\n\nOn this trip to the hospital, Marler was admitted and scanned. Doctors found a suspicious spot on a lymph node and Marler was airlifted back to MD Anderson. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it was happening again. The biopsy showed that it was lymphoma, one of the hardest types to treat. The doctors told me the treatment was going to be so grueling that I would hate them by the time it was over. They were right.\u201d Marler endured six different types of chemotherapy simultaneously, one of which was delivered through her spinal cord. She was required to be admitted to the hospital every other week for six days. \u201cI was so weak I couldn\u2019t get off of my couch. I lost all of my hair, and I had severe body aches,\u201d she recalls.\n\nToday, at 28, Marler is once again in remission\u2014something she definitely doesn\u2019t take for granted. She credits her family for her ability to endure her repeated battles with a smile. She says, \u201cI laugh a lot. That\u2019s one thing my family does really well\u2014we can find the humor in any situation. I\u2019ve always found a way to laugh. I do worry about what\u2019s next, but I can\u2019t let it consume me. I\u2019ve learned to live with it.\u201d Be inspired by these quotes from 34 other cancer survivors\n\nMarler has some advice to others who might be young and too embarrassed to seek help for uncomfortable symptoms: \u201cFind a way to get the help you need\u2014you have to tell someone. Even if it\u2019s writing a letter like I did, find someone you\u2019re comfortable with that you can tell. If I had waited longer, I would have died in my 20s.

The U.S, which entered the war on April 6, 1917, lost more than 116,000 service members in the conflict.\n\nThe National World War I Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, is dedicated to sharing the stories and honoring the history of the devastating conflict, dubbed \u201cthe Great War.\u201d\n\nTHIS BULLET-SCARRED BIBLE \u2018SAVED THE LIFE\u2019 OF A WORLD WAR I SOLDIER\n\nJonathan Casey, director of archives in the Museum\u2019s Edward Jones Research Center, told Fox News that posters related to the war effort can offer a fascinating glimpse into a tumultuous era that changed the course of world history. \u201cPosters are one of the best historical objects to tell the story of any time period,\u201d he explained, noting that the Museum has around 1,200 posters in its collection. \u201cThey are very engaging,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition to U.S. posters, most of which are devoted to recruitment and war financing, the Museum also has posters from a host of other countries including Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Russia. \u201cEach one represents its own culture,\u201d Casey said.\n\nAmong the U.S. posters, Casey highlights one in particular that depicts African-American soldiers working in an Army stevedore company in the French port of St. Nazaire. The poster, which is pictured above, is the only one in the Museum\u2019s collection depicting African-American troops.\n\nAMERICA'S DEADLIEST BATTLE: WORLD WAR I'S MEUSE-ARGONNE OFFENSIVE 100 YEARS LATER\n\nPainted by a U.S. officer, the poster was printed in Nantes, France, as an apparent morale booster for troops. \u201cThere was a competition about how much supplies could be unloaded from the ships,\u201d Casey explained. \u201cThis poster was done in recognition of their work \u2013 it may have been an African-American company that won this competition.\u201d\n\nMeasuring about 2-and-a-half feet by 3 feet, the poster is signed and dedicated by the artist, dated Nov. 28, 1918. \u201cThis was a donation [to the Museum] from a man whose father was an officer in the war, in the Quartermasters\u2019 Corps,\u201d Casey said.\n\nINCREDIBLE WORLD WAR I DIARY SURFACES\n\nOne German military poster is a particular source of fascination. Written in Gothic-style script, the poster, pictured below, it advertises an unusual event in the French town of Malmedy, which was occupied at the time by German forces.\n\nCreated by the German Army\u2019s Gallwitz division, the whimsical poster features a cherubic child, bearing a German helmet filled with flowers. The poster promotes an art exhibition in October 1918, just weeks before the end of the war. The division was part of the German forces opposing the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, which was launched by U.S. forces on Sept. 26, 2018. The 46-day clash claimed the lives of 26,277 U.S. troops and ranks as the deadliest battle in U.S. history.\n\n\u201cThat one came folded up in a photo album from someone whose father was a doctor with U.S. forces,\u201d Casey said, adding that he was surprised when he saw the poster. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why they made a poster to advertise an art show in the middle of this huge war.\u201d\n\n100-YEAR OLD LETTER FROM WWI UNCOVERED\n\nOfficials at the Kansas City site are hosting a number of events to commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I\u2019s end.

He was very quiet and seemed tame.\"\n\nSilver foxes are genetically the same as red foxes, according to World Atlas. The difference lies simply in the fur color, which can range from silver to almost complete black. They are often bred for their fur and are often kept as pets.\n\nThe fox has been described as \"a little overweight\" but is generally thought to be in good health.\n\nLike their red-haired brethren, silver foxes have an omnivorous diet and will eat everything from rodents and rabbits to berries and plants, Wild Atlas adds.

In a video obtained by the Daily Mail on Friday, Murray appears to get visibly upset when one fan allegedly shoved Wang to get closer to the actor.\n\nIn the video, the 68-year-old actor noticed the man's approach and quickly dismissed him by pushing him away from the group.

The question is, 'How good?' The only thing we really do know at this point is the turnout is off the charts.\n\nFormer Clinton Campaign Director of Strategic Communications Adrienne Elrod gives her take on how good of a night it could be for Democrats.", "Never underestimate a woman \u2013 especially Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to serve as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and once the most powerful female elected official in American history. Now she is poised to claim those titles again in January.\n\nPelosi, a California Democrat representing San Francisco, was speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011. She has been House minority leader since 2011, when Republicans gained majority control of the chamber.\n\nBut on Tuesday, everything changed when voters elected enough Democrats to make them the majority party in the House again when those elected Tuesday take office two months from now.\n\nIf Pelosi can overcome opposition by some Democrats who want a younger party leader and is elected to become speaker again, she will be the first person to return to the speakership after losing it since Rep. Sam Rayburn, D-Texas, accomplished the feat in 1955.\n\nNo one has ever returned to the speakership for a second time after being in the minority for eight years.\n\nPelosi didn\u2019t rise as far as she did in politics by chance. No one in Washington understands politics and power better than she does.\n\nPelosi was born into a Democratic political family and grew up in Baltimore surrounded by politics. Her father, Thomas D\u2019Alesandro, served in the U.S. House and as mayor of Baltimore. Her brother also served as mayor of Baltimore.\n\nWhile she was in college Pelosi worked as an intern in the Senate and attended the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy in 1961. She has been a member of the House since 1987.\n\nA progressive who knows how to play hardball, Pelosi knows how to count votes, be practical, and get things done. No one in the House raises more money for Democratic candidates nor understands what it takes to win races better than she does.\n\nAnd no one knows how to get legislation passed better than Pelosi. She is the reason ObamaCare won approval in Congress \u2013 President Obama has said that. Pelosi is the one who came up with the strategy, wrangled the votes and made it possible for the Affordable Care Act to become law.\n\nHealth care was the most important issue to voters in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, exit polling showed, helping Democrats again take control of the House.\n\nWhen Pelosi was speaker she ran the Democratic caucus far more effectively, and with more accomplishments, than did her two Republican successors \u2013 Rep. John Boehner of Ohio and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\n\nUnder Pelosi\u2019s speakership and in her time as minority leader, House Democrats have been united and worked together to get things done. During her tenure as the minority leader during the first two years of the Trump presidency, not one Democrat defected on votes involving ObamaCare and the tax code. Not one.\n\nBoehner and Ryan were driven from the speakership by their caucus. Pelosi is expected to return as speaker.\n\nIn every election in modern times, Republicans have attacked women like Pelosi when they campaign against Democrats. It may help Republicans raise money, but it cost them votes on Tuesday. In fact, it cost them the House.\n\nMore than 100 women were elected to Congress this week. And it\u2019s one more reason I believe Pelosi will be speaker.

It also expressed concern over the safety of those trapped in Hodeida as the intensified military operations \"are increasingly confining populations and cutting off exit routes.\"\n\nYemeni government forces covered by the coalition's air and naval forces continue to engage in heavy fighting with the rebels, known as Houthis. The fighting has killed dozens of combatants from both sides, with dozens of military vehicles destroyed or burning along the front lines.\n\nIn a Friday statement, Yemen's internationally recognized government based in the southern city of Aden said its forces are advancing toward the north and west of Hodeida and across all fronts with cover from the coalition.\n\nThe fighting around the city, a vital lifeline for most Yemen's population, threatens to worsen Yemen's already-dire humanitarian situation and risks the obstruction of crucial assistance to the country endangering the lives of millions of Yemenis.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 with the aim of defeating the Iran-aligned rebels and to restore the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. But the coalition has recently come under mounting international pressure to end the war that has resulted in what the U.N. says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned of the repercussions the continued fighting may have on millions of Yemenis. The council estimates the humanitarian cost of the war to have reached almost $3 billion in 2018 alone.\n\n\"We are now warning that by allowing this to go on, parties to the conflict and their international backers will be responsible for the death, injury and suffering of millions of people,\" Mohamed Abdi, the council's director in Yemen, said in a statement. \"Senseless attacks on civilians, evidence of a starving population and desperate pleas from humanitarian witnesses have done little more than elicit condolences from an international community that could have stepped on the brakes long ago.\"\n\nThe U.S. and U.K., major arms suppliers to the Saudi coalition, have recently called for a cease-fire in Yemen and the launch of U.N.-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war.

But the reporter who originally flagged the abandoned box later walked it back, citing another local reporter who tweeted a photo showing the apparent container filled with little more than supplies.\n\nIn the Scott campaign\u2019s lawsuit, joined by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), they allege that officials in Broward County are hiding critical information about the number of votes cast and counted.

Unless it\u2019s Pelosi. Put Pelosi in the one slot and Avenatti in the two-hole and I think that\u2019s your dream ticket. They currently represent the Democratic Party. I would do that right now. Pelosi seems to have a way of rising back up to the top. My wife pointed out to me that Pelosi has staying power. Maybe it\u2019s time to reward her with the big job.

Yeah, I guess, but it\u2019s sort of preachy comedy. It\u2019s not the sort of comedy that gets a big belly laugh as much as it gets a wizened nod.

The FDA\u2019s planned restrictions, first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed to Reuters by the official, do not apply to vape shops or other specialty retail stores.\n\nThere has been mounting pressure for action after preliminary federal data showed teenage use had surged by more than 75 percent since last year, and the FDA has described it as an \u201cepidemic\u201d.\n\n1 DEATH LINKED TO ONGOING TURKEY SALMONELLA OUTBREAK\n\n\u201cE-cigs have become an almost ubiquitous \u2012 and dangerous \u2012 trend among teens,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in September. \u201cThe disturbing and accelerating trajectory of use we\u2019re seeing in youth, and the resulting path to addiction, must end.

The FDA gave Juul and four big tobacco companies 60 days to submit plans to curb underage use, a compliance period that is now ending.\n\nThe planned restrictions on flavors in convenience stores are likely to have the biggest impact on Juul, which sells nicotine liquid pods in flavors such as mango, mint, fruit and creme, previously called creme brulee.\n\nThe only other e-cigarette competitors sold at convenience stores are those marketed primarily by tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc, British American Tobacco Plc, Imperial Brands Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc .\n\nThose products, sold under the MarkTen, blu, Vuse and Logic brands, have lost market share as Juul has risen to prominence over the last year, growing from 13.6 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market in early 2017 to nearly 75 percent now, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen retail data.\n\nE-cigarette products represent a small share of revenue for major tobacco companies, whereas Juul\u2019s business is built entirely on the vaping devices. Revenue from e-cigarette devices made up less than 1 percent of British American Tobacco\u2019s global revenue for the first six months of 2018, according to a company filing from July.\n\nNEVADA VOTES TO ELIMINATE 'TAMPON TAX' ON FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS\n\nAltria last month announced it would stop selling its pod-based electronic cigarettes, generally smaller devices that use pre-filled nicotine liquid cartridges, in response to the FDA\u2019s concerns about teen usage.

The claim led to her arrest and 2010 death sentence on blasphemy charges. In Pakistan, a mere accusation of blasphemy has caused riots, even lynching.\n\nRights groups have said Pakistan's blasphemy law is often used as an excuse to settle scores, or as a weapon against religious minorities, including Shiite Muslims who are at times targeted by Sunni Muslim militants as heretics.\n\nBibi has been in hiding in Islamabad since her release earlier this week. Her family says she will leave Pakistan as soon as possible because of death threats against her.\n\n___\n\nWHO THE PAKISTANI CHRISTIANS ARE\n\nThere are about 1.3 million Christians in Pakistan, a predominantly Sunni Muslim country of 204 million people. The Christians are the second-largest minority, after Hindus, and are almost evenly divided between Catholic and Protestant denominations.\n\nThe Christian population grew at the time of Pakistan's creation in 1947, when the Indian subcontinent was divided into two nations. At the time, many lower caste Hindus, living in what would become Pakistan, converted to Christianity. They were among the region's poorest and held jobs many others didn't want.\n\nAlthough some Christians have risen to senior positions, including A.R. Cornelius who served as Pakistan's chief justice, many live in impoverished communities commonly referred to as \"sweeper colonies\" because residents are employed as domestic and sanitation workers.\n\n___\n\nHOW PAKISTAN'S GOVERNMENTS HAVE TREATED CHRISTIANS\n\nThe rise of Islamic radicalism in Pakistan has left the country's minority religions vulnerable. The blasphemy law, which carries the death penalty for anyone convicted of insulting Islam, has been used at times as a tool against minorities. Christian churches and homes have been attacked by crowds invoking the law.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan, elected in July, in part on an Islamic agenda, has vacillated between criticizing religious parties for using religion to enhance their influence, and bowing to their demands, including firing minorities from government-appointed positions.\n\nIn Bibi's case, Khan seemingly caved to the Islamists' demand to have her acquittal reviewed in an appeal \u2014 though some suspected he was trying to buy time to disperse the protesters.\n\nAnalysts say mixed signals from the government only embolden extremists. Minority religious leaders also say the poverty of the Christian minority sharply reduces their political clout.\n\n___\n\nHOW CHRISTIANS ARE FARING IN OTHER MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES\n\nEgypt's Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the country's 100 million Muslim-majority population, have long complained of discrimination and under-representation in government. Sectarian violence occasionally erupts in rural communities where Christian churches have been torched. Overwhelmingly, attacks on Egyptian Copts have been carried out by Islamist extremists, mainly the Islamic State group, which has killed scores of Christians in recent years.\n\nLebanon's Christian community is the second-largest in the Middle East, after Egypt's, but has gone from being a majority to ranging between 30 and 35 percent of the population. Despite their dwindling numbers, Lebanese Christians still retain relative political power with multiple political parties and a president, who must be a Christian Maronite, according to an unwritten national pact.\n\nAcross the Holy Land, Christians now make up an estimated 1 to 2 percent of the population, a marked decline over the decades. Reasons include a relatively low birth rate and increased emigration by Palestinian Christians, driven by the fallout from the long-running conflict with Israel. In the Gaza Strip, the number of Christians has dropped from 3,000 to 1,000 over the past decade of rule by the Islamic militant group Hamas \u2014 a period that has been marked by armed conflict with Israel, border closures and soaring unemployment.\n\nIraq has been seeing a dramatic exodus of its Christians since dictator Saddam Hussein was ousted in 2003. Muslim extremists, mostly from the al-Qaida terror network and later the Islamic State group, have bombed churches and shrines in Baghdad and the city of Mosul, and assassinated high-level bishops and priests. There were thought to be over 1 million Christians living in Iraq before the U.S.-led invasion of 2003; today only a fraction remains.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Menna Zaki in Cairo, Philip Issa in Baghdad, Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.", "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman elected to Congress Tuesday, said she cannot afford to rent an apartment in Washington, D.C., until her congressional salary kicks in.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, 29, made national headlines after she defeated 10-term Rep.

That was down from 335 the year before, but the number of violent anti-Semitic acts rose, along with anti-Muslim and other violent hate crimes.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said part of the recent rise could be attributed to a government push over the past year to encourage people to report hate crimes, including a new online portal to file police reports.\n\nThe prime minister promised new measures to better handle victims and punish perpetrators, to take down potentially violent hate speech online more quickly and to help teachers who report anti-Semitic behavior.\n\n\"Each attack against one of our compatriots because he or she is Jewish resonates like new broken glass,\" the prime minister said, in reference to the mass crackdown on Jews throughout Germany and Austria on Nov. 9, 1938 known as the Night of Broken Glass, or Kristallnacht. \"It is up to each French person to mobilize 'for' something: for life together, for France's identity, for the values of the Republic.\"\n\nAnti-racism groups said they have also noted a rise in anti-Semitism this year.\n\nIslamic extremists targeted a Jewish school and kosher supermarket in two of France's most deadly terrorist attacks in recent years, and some blame Islamic radicalism for resurgent anti-Semitism in France.

The head of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, said the building was set alight in 1938 and the blaze extinguished relatively quickly only so as not to endanger neighboring houses.\n\nSchuster said that, while the Nazis' SA and SS organizations were responsible for the pogrom, that already meant thousands of Germans took part \u2014 and the population's reaction \"gave the Nazis valuable information: barely anyone protested.\"\n\nHe added that, while modern-day attacks on Jews, migrants and Muslims can't be equated with the crimes of the Nazi era, \"I see it as a disgrace for our country that such things happen in Germany in 2018.\"\n\nHe assailed the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which he said has \"respect for nothing\" and which his organization didn't invite to Friday's event.

But #Broward still hasn\u2019t finished & won\u2019t disclose how many ballots are left.\"\n\nRubio and Scott both made it clear they have no confidence in Snipes' integrity.\n\n\"A U.S. Senate seat & a statewide cabinet officer are now potentially in the hands of an elections supervisor with a history of incompetence & of blatant violations of state & federal laws,\" Rubio wrote, linking to a Miami Herald article describing several scandals that have gripped Broward County\u2019s Elections Department.\n\nEarlier this year, a judge found that Snipes had illegally destroyed ballots in a 2016 congressional contest, leading the secretary of state's office to assign election monitors to supervise her.\n\n\u201cI think the problems are blown out of proportion,\u201d Snipes said in October, in an interview with The Miami Herald. \u201cBroward is nitpicked to the bone. Other places have the same problems, different problems. It\u2019s just that they are not spotlighted like we are.\u201d\n\nAt his Thursday press conference, Scott outlined some of Snipes' troubled history.\n\n\"In 2016, Brenda Snipes\u2019 office posted election results half an hour before polls closed \u2013 a violation of election law,\" Scott said. \"That same year, her office was sued for leaving amendments off of ballots. In 2014, Brenda Snipes\u2019 fellow Democrats accused her of individual and systemic breakdowns that made it difficult for voters to cast regular ballots. All Floridians should be concerned about that.\"\n\nVote totals in several major races in the state are changing rapidly, on an irregular schedule and sometimes late into the evening. Scott was ahead of Nelson by roughly one-fourth of one percentage point as of Thursday morning, according to The Tampa Bay Times. The paper also said the agriculture commissioner candidates were separated by only 0.06 points. That race flipped in favor of the Democratic candidate on Thursday afternoon.\n\nBroward County reported that significantly more votes were received in the agriculture commissioner contest than the much higher-profile Senate election. An attorney for Nelson's campaign suggested a computer error might explain that anomaly.\n\nIn the closely watched gubernatorial race, DeSantis held a narrow 0.52-percentage-point edge over Gillum as of Thursday morning, extremely close to the 0.5 percent threshold needed to trigger a machine recount. Gillum has conceded the race, although his decision is nonbinding.\n\nBut by Thursday afternoon, unofficial figures had DeSantis up by just 38,515 votes out of the more than 8 million cast -- a lead of just 0.47 percent, low enough to trigger a mandatory recount, according to The Tallahassee Democrat. No recount has yet been announced by Florida's secretary of state; the first unofficial vote count is expected to be verified Saturday.\n\n\"On Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count,\" Gillum's campaign said in a statement Thursday evening. \"Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported. Our campaign, along with our attorney Barry Richard, is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount.\"\n\nWithout providing legally sufficient justification, Rubio said, Democrat-controlled Broward and Palm Beach counties on Wednesday afternoon continued to report new ballots, cutting into Scott's already-thin lead and also flipping the state's agriculture commissioner race to Democrats.\n\nPalm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher told Fox News that Palm Beach is still counting about 2,000 mail-in ballots where voters circled or highlighted (by drawing an arrow pointing at the candidate\u2019s name) their choice, instead of filling in the appropriate bubbles.\n\nBucher told Fox News that elections department staff is going through each of the 2,000 mail-in ballots, and where voter intent is determined, a worker is filling in a new ballot on behalf of the voter. Where voter intent cannot be determined, the ballot is sent to the canvassing board to undergo review.\n\nElections officials are also reviewing 1,500 military and overseas ballots which are still being counted. Florida law allows military servicemembers to mail or fax ballots in. A provisional vote report is due in Tallahassee on Saturday by noon.\n\n\"#Broward election supervisors ongoing violation of #Florida law requiring timely reporting isn\u2019t just annoying incompetence,\" Rubio wrote. \"It has opened the door for lawyers to come here & try to steal a seat in the U.S. Senate & Florida Cabinet.\"\n\nFlorida law dictates that if the margin in any race hits 0.25 percent or lower, a manual recount of any ballots set aside from the machine recount will be ordered -- reminiscent of the scene in the 2000 presidential election, when the country was gripped by images of poll workers counting votes deciphering hanging chads by hand.\n\nBroward County election officials did not return Fox News' multiple requests for comment.\n\nFox News' Heather Lacy contributed to this report.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nThe first hour of the Brian Kilmeade Radio Show on FOX News Talk 9am-Noon Eastern M-F.", "Families of those killed when a Buk missile blew Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 out of the sky above Ukraine in 2014 have called on U.S. President Donald Trump to press his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to provide answers about the downing.\n\nIn a letter to Trump published Friday on Twitter, relatives of about 30 of the 298 passengers and crew killed on July 17, 2014, say \"we have a right to know what happened to our loved ones.\"\n\nThe letter was posted to Twitter by Thomas Schansman, whose 18-year-old son Quinn, a dual Dutch-American citizen, was among the passengers killed.\n\nTrump and Putin will both be in Paris this weekend for commemorations of the centenary of the end of World War I, but are not expected to hold a bilateral summit.

Charles de Gaulle.\n\nWith stops at once-bloody battlefields and poignant WWI memorials, Macron achieved one of his main goals: To highlight soldiers' sacrifices and sound renewed warnings about European division and rising nationalism, dangers he is increasingly concerned about.\n\nBut the commemorative pathos and broader message were also polluted by the more immediate concerns of citizens he met. In the town of Charleville-Mezieres, where Macron had his entire cabinet hold its weekly meeting, instead of in his gilded offices at the Elysee Palace in Paris, a retiree challenged him over shrinking pensions.\n\nAnd he's had to repeatedly defend his government's policies on fuel. High prices at the pumps have dominated news bulletins. Crude oil prices are largely to blame. But Macron's government has also hiked fuel taxes to fight pollution, angering drivers and truckers who plan to protest by blocking roads across France next week.\n\n\"I prefer taxing fuel to taxing labor. People complaining about rising fuel prices are the same ones who complain about pollution and how their children suffer,\" Macron said in an interview to regional newspapers.\n\nFending off criticism about fuel and pensions wasn't the main goal for Macron's aides as they carefully choreographed his tour through regions among the hardest-hit by deindustrialization and agricultural difficulties. With rates of unemployment and poverty above the national average, France's northeast is pock-marked by discontent that has proved to be fertile ground for far-right French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, beaten by Macron in last year's presidential election.\n\nMacron said, however, that he was happy for the opportunity to deal with people's grievances directly.\n\n\"There are days when people are angry,\" he said Thursday as he toured a Renault car factory hailed as a model of productivity. \"I need to explain what I do to those who are angry, to respect them and listen to them. That's what I do.\"\n\nThe confused and mixed messaging that came out of Macron's tour was also partly his fault. On Wednesday, he stirred controversy and angered France's main Jewish group by speaking favorably of the World War I record of Marshal Philippe Petain \u2014 a general who subsequently became a top collaborator with the Nazis in World War II.\n\nMacron's domestic troubles won't hinder his role as WWI commemoration-organizer-in-chief this weekend.\n\nIndeed, hosting Trump, Putin and other world leaders could offer a welcome moment of respite.\n\n___\n\nSylvie Corbet has covered French politics for The Associated Press since 2010.", "A knife attack that left one dead and two others wounded Friday in Australia\u2019s second-largest city in the middle of rush hour is linked to terrorism, police said.\n\nThe standoff in Melbourne came after police responded to reports of a burning vehicle.

Yet, even then it could not be stopped.\n\nWith both sides in the war already knowing for hours a cease-fire would start at 11 a.m. on the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, hundreds of good men kept falling that morning.\n\nFear the other side would not abide by the conditions of the armistice, a sheer hatred produced by four years of unprecedented slaughter, blind ambition of commanders who craved that last victory, the inane joy of killing, reason enough not to let humanity shine through a few minutes, hours early. Put together they trumped the lives of soldiers, many of whom were convinced they were on the brink of peace and survival.\n\nWith two minutes to go, Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was shot by a German sniper close to Mons in southern Belgium. Another life shattered in its prime at 25.\n\nSome 250 kilometers (150 miles) away on the Western Front in France, an American soldier Henry Gunther, for reasons still hard to explain a century later, stormed a German post with only one minute left before the armistice and was mowed down by machine gun fire. He was 23.\n\n\"Gunther's act is seen as almost a symbol of the futility of the larger war,\" said U.S. historian Alec Bennett. \"He was the last American. I believe he may have been the last soldier on any side to die in World War I.\"\n\nAny soldier who died that morning might well be an equal symbol of futility, and the mark of \"Nov. 11, 1918\" on any headstone at a World War I cemetery makes it especially poignant.\n\n\"It was a matter of minutes,\" said Corentin Rousman, a Belgian historian working in Mons, where British empire soldiers had their first battle with the Germans in August 1914, and also their last over four years later, when Price perished.\n\nFor Commonwealth commanders it must have been especially sweet to retake the city, bringing the war to a full circle right where they lost their first soldier, English Private John Parr who had stumbled onto the Germans on Aug. 21, 1914.\n\nIn between, World War I had claimed some 14 million lives, including 9 million soldiers, sailors and airmen from 28 countries. Early on, Germany came close to a quick victory before the conflict settled into hellish trench warfare. One battle, like the Somme in France could have up to a million casualties. Poison gas came to epitomize the cruel ruthlessness of a war the likes of which history had never seen.\n\nWhen the old European powers were close to exhaustion in the war of attrition it came to fewer nations like Gunther's United States and Price's Canada to make the difference.\n\nPrice had been a farm laborer in Saskatchewan when the swirl of history picked him off the land in 1917 as the allies sought ever more manpower to keep the Germans at bay on the Western Front.\n\nThe following summer he was part of the allied surge, and despite being gassed, he took city upon village upon city \u2014 right up to the morning of Nov. 11.\n\nNews of the impending cease-fire was already known, still he decided to go check out some homes along the historic network of industrial canals while in the center of Mons citizens already broke out the wine and whisky they had hidden for years to celebrate the liberation of their ancient medieval city.\n\n\"Then it is unclear what happens,\" said Rousman. Either Price runs out of a home to help someone or he thinks the war is over. What happened instead was that a shot rang out across a canal and Price dropped.\n\n\"There no longer was any massive artillery around. It really was one man, here and there, who was driven by vengeance, by a need to kill one last time,\" Rousman said.\n\nAnd minutes not only counted for the dead but also for the killers.\n\n\"There are rules in war,\" Rousman said. \"There is always the possibility to kill two minutes before a cease-fire. Two minutes after, the German would have had to stand before a judge. That's the difference.\"\n\nThe soldier who shot Price was never identified, swallowed up in a German retreat.\n\nIn senseless death, Price made the war come full circle at the level of soldiers.\n\nWith leaves falling on Saint Symphorien cemetery just outside Mons, Price, the last Commonwealth victim killed in the war, lies within a stone's throw from Parr, the first one.\n\n\"He is not forgotten,\" said Rousman. \"It's a soldier whose tomb is often draped in flowers, notes and Canadian flags.\"\n\n___\n\nExcerpt from \"World War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition,\" available at Amazon https://amzn.to/2JGrx5U", "Oscar-nominated actor Viggo Mortensen apologized for using the N-word during a panel discussion Wednesday following the screening of his new film \"Green Book.\"\n\nMortensen's remark came during a discussion about race in America following a screening put on by the Film Independent Presents group in Hollywood, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"For instance, no one says N\u2014 anymore,\" he said.\n\nDick Schulz, a Film Independent member and freelance director, said he was present at the screening in a tweet and that the \"oxygen immediately left the room\" after Mortensen\u2019s comment.\n\n\"It was all anyone was talking about when we left the theater,\" Schulz said. \"I was hearing everybody passing by me going up the stairs going, 'That was crazy!'\"\n\nIn \"Green Book,\" Mortensen plays a bouncer hired by famed African-American pianist, Don Shirley, to serve as his driver and security during a 1960s tour of the Jim Crow-era South.\n\nThe movie title references \"The Negro Motorist Green Book,\" which served as a travel guide for African-Americans traveling in the South during segregation by listing friendly and whites-only hotels, restaurants and other businesses.\n\n\"In making the point that many people casually used the 'N' word at the time in which the movie's story takes place, in 1962, I used the full word,\" Mortensen said in a statement to THR. \"Although my intention was to speak strongly against racism, I have no right to even imagine the hurt that is caused by hearing that word in any context, especially from a white man.\"\n\nHe promised never to say it again.\n\nAccording to Schulz, Mortensen responded to a question directed at another panelist and quickly went downhill from there.\n\n\"Viggo just started talking, and it got away from him quickly,\" Schulz said. \"And that's when he went, 'I'm gonna go off on a tangent here, but it's important, and I don't like saying the word,\" before uttering the word.\n\nThe incident follows a former Netflix communication executive who said the N-word during a company meeting in the context of explaining why it shouldn\u2019t be said.\n\nJohnathan Friedland was dismissed from the company in June for \u201cunacceptably low racial awareness and sensitivity,\u201d according to Netflix.", "Mira Sorvino said she has zero regrets about coming forward and sharing her horrifying experiences of sexual harassment in Hollywood.\n\nThe 51-year-old Oscar-winner was one of the first women to go public with allegations of sexual misconduct against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, sparking the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements.

In September, Variety reported that Sorvino was one of several actresses who advocated for \u201cTake the Lead\u201d or bills that were designed to toughen California\u2019s enforcement of sexual harassment laws and make it easier for victims to pursue civil claims.

The streaming series explores how a desperate banker, a gang lord and hacker duke it out for power as they are threatened by the U.S. Government.\n\nRon Perlman, who stars as Wes Chandler, told Fox News he was in awe by Sorvino\u2019s warmth on set, as well as her determination to help create a captivating tale.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I had met Mira,\u201d explained the 68-year-old actor. \u201c[I] was impressed by her professionalism, her warmth, her generosity coming in on the third season of a show.

And so she just blended right in\u2026 Most of the time, I blew my line because I just was too busy being an audience member watching her work.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to the current political climate, the pair insisted it hasn\u2019t impacted their performances.\n\n\u201cAside from sometimes the situation getting into my head and making me in a bad mood at times, it hasn\u2019t affected my ability to perform or my choices as an actor,\u201d said Sorvino. \u201cI always try to choose things based on their quality and sometimes based on their social impact\u2026 But\u2026 no, it really hasn\u2019t affected my working life. It\u2019s more my psychological life.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019ve learned how to perform on Xanax,\u201d joked Perlman. \u201cBeing able to focus while highly medicated due to the political climate we\u2019re living in. That\u2019s a stretch for me. That\u2019s my new skill. Goes right on the bottom of my resume.\u201d\n\nStill, Sorvino admitted that filming in Puerto Rico after the devastation of Hurricane Maria greatly impacted her even after cameras stopped rolling. In January, Broadway World reported production for Season 3 of \u201cStartUp\u201d was underway in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cI got to know all the amazing people that were on the crew who were from Puerto Rico and saw the devastation that the hurricane left them in and how we really as a country had done so little to help them,\u201d she said. \u201cEven almost a year later, like a fifth, at least maybe a quarter of all the roads were still covered... all the road signs are still down and torqued and people were still living without electricity and running water.\n\n\u201cI feel like every job is a journey in which you\u2019re learning something as a human being. On [\u2018StartUp\u2019], not only did I get to learn from the story and from my fellow cast members, but I also got to see up close and personal the way that the island was suffering and how our government needs to do much, much more for them.\u201d\n\nPerlman said the duo are motivated as ever as actors because there are many new stories to tell and many new people to meet \u2014 those in particular who can provide eye-opening lessons. Perlman insisted he doesn\u2019t take that privilege as an actor for granted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never gonna retire,\u201d said Perlman. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep doing this because it\u2019s a phenomenal way to go through life. I love being on sets, be it television or movies, and I love the people I\u2019ve met \u2014 big-hearted, wonderful, imaginative, beautiful people\u2026 along the way. It\u2019s like a drug for me. So the fact that I\u2019m busier now than ever is, I consider it to be one of the great blessings that could have been bestowed.\u201d\n\nThese days, Sorvino is looking forward to what the future holds for her.\n\n\u201cI always try not to repeat myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI try not to play the same person twice, which goes against the grain of certain philosophies about how to have a successful career \u2014 that you find your niche and then you stick it and you kind of play that the same person over and over again.\n\n\u201cA perfect example was the great Cary Grant. He was very largely in similar roles, but he was so perfect at. I\u2019m kind of opposite\u2026 as an actor. I like to try and disappear into my roles, so each role brings that challenge.\u201d\n\n\"StartUP\" is currently streaming on Sony Crackle.

Rick Scott, a Republican seeking a U.S. Senate seat, filed lawsuits against the state\u2019s top election officials late Thursday, accusing Democrats of trying to 'steal' Tuesday\u2019s election. Three major races in the Sunshine State appear headed for recounts\n\nNo clear motive emerged Thursday after a Marine Corps veteran opened fire in a Southern California bar, killing 12 people late Wednesday\n\nActing U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker faces calls from more than a dozen state attorneys general that he recuse himself from the Justice Department's Russia investigation\n\nPresident Trump on Friday is expected to formally announce that migrants attempting to cross into the U.S. illegally will not be able to claim asylum under a new rule\n\nFOX News host Tucker Carlson vowed that he would not be silenced and thanked supporters after Antifa members targeted his home Wednesday\n\nTHE LEAD STORY - CHAOS IN FLORIDA - Accusing Democrats of conducting a coordinated effort to \"steal\" elections in a campaign of possibly \"rampant fraud,\" Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rick Scott filed explosive lawsuits late Thursday against the top election officials in two heavily Democratic counties, as they continue to report new votes and three major races in the state appear headed for recounts ... In their lawsuit against Broward County, Scott and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) allege that officials there are hiding critical information about the number of votes cast and counted. And in a parallel suit against Palm Beach County, Scott and the NRSC charge that the election supervisor there illegally used her own judgment to determine voter intent when reviewing damaged absentee ballots, while refusing to allow witnesses to monitor the process.\n\nScott is running against longtime incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. \"Late Tuesday night, our win was projected to be around 57,000 votes,\" Scott told reporters. \"By Wednesday morning that lead dropped to 38,000. By Wednesday evening, it was around 30,000. This morning, it was around 21,000. Now, it is 15,000.\" A mandatory recount now appears imminent not only in Scott's race, but also in the agricultural commissioner race and Florida's high-profile gubernatorial contest between Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis, based on new vote totals -- even though Gillum has already conceded. Florida law requires a machine recount when candidates are within 0.50 percentage points of each other. - Reported by Gregg Re (@gregg_re on Twitter)\n\nSEARCH FOR ANSWERS IN CALIFORNIA BAR MASSACRE: Police in Ventura County, Calif., are looking for a motive behind a Marine veteran's shooting rampage at a crowded bar late Wednesday night that left 12 people dead ... Authorities believe Ian David Long, 28, eventually turned the gun on himself, but not before he terrorized a crowd filled with college students at Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks. Long's body was found in an office near the entrance of the bar. Sheriff Geoff Dean, who is set to retire Friday, said Long may have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and was known to law enforcement officials due to several unspecified \"contacts\" stretching back multiple years.\n\nLong served in the Marine Corps from August 2008 to March 2013, with a deployment in Afghanistan between November 2010 and June 2011, military records show. Dean said the last interaction between Long and authorities occurred in April, when police officers were called to Long's house after reports of a disturbance. When they arrived, officers found Long \"irate and acting irrationally,\" leading to a crisis intervention team being summoned. The team, however, cleared Long and said they didn't think he required being taken into custody. - Reported by Katherine Lam (@bykatherinelam on Twitter) and Stephen Sorace\n\nTHE FIGHT TO 'PROTECT' THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION: Eighteen U.S. state attorneys general signed a document Thursday calling for Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, a role he assumed following his temporary appointment following the resignation of Jeff Sessions ... The document was released on Twitter by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who tweeted that Whitaker must \u201crecuse himself immediately.\u201d \u201cActing AG Whitaker\u2019s hostility to the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation disqualifies him from overseeing Robert Mueller,\u201d Healey tweeted. \u201cDeputy Attorney General Rosenstein must be allowed to protect the Special Counsel and insulate the investigation from interference by the White House. #ProtectMueller\u201d\n\nIn addition to Healey, the document was signed by 17 other attorneys generals -- from New York, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, California, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island, Washington state, Virginia, New Mexico and Maryland. As part of Whitaker\u2019s new role as the head official at the Justice Department, he will oversee the Russia probe and the agency's other federal investigations, including the New York prosecutors' look into the finances of President Trump and his former aides. Critics are alarmed because Whitaker previously argued in an op-ed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation would be overreaching if it looked into Trump's finances and that its scope needed to be limited. - Reported by Elizabeth Zwirz\n\nChris Christie being considered to replace Sessions, report says\n\nJeff Flake announces plan to vote on special counsel protection legislation\n\nASYLUM FIGHT BREWS: The Trump administration announced Thursday that migrants who attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally will not be eligible to claim asylum under a new rule meant to crack down on \"meritless\" claims ... The rule, which prevents migrants from claiming asylum if they do not do so at an official border crossing, is the latest attempt by the White House to handle a surge in migration to the U.S. from the Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. President Trump is expected to formally enact the rule in a presidential proclamation Friday and will invoke the same powers he used to push through a version of the travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court, according to senior administration officials. - Reported by Samuel Chamberlain\n\n\u2022 Feinstein urged Obama in 2014 to use 'broad power' to limit immigration\n\n\u2022 Federal appeals court rules against Trump administration on DACA\n\nTUCKER: I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED: FOX News host Tucker Carlson vowed he would not be \"silenced\" after left-wing Antifa members targeted his home, and he thanked well-wishers for their support ... On Wednesday evening, a self-described Antifa group posted videos of a mob outside the Washington, D.C., home of Carlson, chanting, \u201cTucker Carlson, we will fight. We know where you sleep at night.\u201d Carlson was on a pre-planned vacation Thursday night when he called into his own show to discuss how Antifa members had gathered outside his home and threatened his wife and family. \"What\u2019s it like to find out that your wife is hiding in the pantry because people are threatening her? I mean, it\u2019s upsetting,\u201d Carlson told guest host Brian Kilmeade. \u201cI've characterized the Antifa people and people like them as protesters, but they\u2019re not. I mean, they weren't protesting anything. \u2026 They weren't trying to change my mind. \u2026 They were threatening my family to get me to stop talking. And obviously, I'm not going to because it's my job.\"\n\nThe FOX News host and best-selling-author noted that he had received support from friends and political foes alike during the aftermath of the ordeal. \"For every masked lunatic in front of my house, there have been \u2026 100 people, some of whom I don't agree with politically, calling or sending text of support and kindness,\" Carlson said. \"It\u2019s just a reminder of what a really nice country it is.\" Washington, D.C., police reportedly have launched an investigation into the anti-Carlson protests.\n\nFOX News' statement on the Tucker incident\n\n\n\nAS SEEN ON FOX NEWS\n\nINCIVILITY IN THE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - \"You can disagree with the way he conducts himself and his behavior, but the idea that the White House put out a doctored video as a reason for Jim Acosta to have his pass revoked \u2026 in my view, this is really Kremlin-esque.

What if that person went looking for our girls? Donald Trump, with his loud and reckless innuendos, was putting my family\u2019s safety at risk. And for this I\u2019d never forgive him.\u201d\n\nThe new book, which is primarily a biography, will reportedly detail her feelings on Trump and the 2016 presidential election. She says she reacted in shock the night she learned Trump would replace her husband in the Oval Office and tried to \"block it all out,\" according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nShe criticizes Trump for the 2005 \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, interpreting his comments to mean: \u201cI can hurt you and get away with it,\u201d The Associated Press reported.\n\nLEAKED TAPE CAPTURES TRUMP IN CRUDE RANT WITH TV HOST\n\nShe also criticizes Trump\u2019s body language during a 2016 presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, which she says amounted to stalking.

Nearly 10 million soldiers died, often in brutal trench warfare where poison gas added a cruelty in warfare that the world had never seen.\n\nHundreds of thousands from all corners of the world died in Europe, many of them on the Western Front reaching from Belgium's Flanders Fields almost up to the Swiss border.\n\nCarrying the heritage of defeated Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel will be visiting the site in the woods north of Paris where military leaders agreed in a train carriage to the armistice at 5 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918, six hours before it took effect.\n\nOn Sunday, in another show of reconciliation, Merkel will open an international peace forum in Paris with Macron and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nLike other leaders visiting national cemeteries dotted around northern France, Trump will visit two burial sites that highlight how the United States came of age as a military power after it joined the war in 1917 and set it up to become a dominating force for the next century.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

For Senate Democrats they faced the worst possible map any party ever encountered in Senate contests since 1938. There were a total of 35 seats in play. But only 9 on the GOP side of the aisle. Most of those were states which would remain in Republican hands like Utah and Wyoming.\n\nAnd the Democratic seats? Many in states carried by President Trump. Democrats lost North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri. Yet Democrats fared well holding other seats key to Mr. Trump's victory in 2016: Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nStill, in the end, the map was too much for Senate Democrats. For House Republicans their biggest problem was more than 40 GOP retirement and historical norms of the President's party LOSING an average of 29 seats in the midterms.

It was during this hiatus that he penned a handwritten letter to his beloved younger sister, Maja, warning of the dangers of growing nationalism and anti-Semitism years before the Nazis ultimately rose to power, forcing Einstein to flee his native Germany for good.\n\n\"Out here, nobody knows where I am, and I'm believed to be missing,\" he wrote in August 1922. \"Here are brewing economically and politically dark times, so I'm happy to be able to get away from everything.\"\n\nThe previously unknown letter, brought forward by an anonymous collector, is set to go on auction next week in Jerusalem with an opening asking price of $12,000.\n\nAs the most influential scientist of the 20th century, Einstein's life and writings have been thoroughly researched. The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which Einstein was a founder, houses the world's largest collection of Einstein material. Together with the California Institute of Technology it runs the Einstein Papers Project. Individual auctions of his personal letters have brought in substantial sums in recent years.\n\nThe 1922 letter shows he was concerned about Germany's future a full year before the Nazis even attempted their first coup \u2014 the failed Munich Beer Hall Putsch to seize power in Bavaria.\n\n\"This letter reveals to us the thoughts that were running through Einstein's mind and heart at a very preliminary stage of Nazi terror,\" said Meron Eren, co-owner of the Kedem Auction House in Jerusalem, which obtained the letter and offered The Associated Press a glimpse before the public sale. \"The relationship between Albert and Maja was very special and close, which adds another dimension to Einstein the man and greater authenticity to his writings.\"\n\nThe letter, which bears no return address, is presumed to have been written while he was staying in the port city of Kiel before embarking on a lengthy speaking tour across Asia.\n\n\"I'm doing pretty well, despite all the anti-Semites among the German colleagues. I'm very reclusive here, without noise and without unpleasant feelings, and am earning my money mainly independent of the state, so that I'm really a free man,\" he wrote. \"You see, I am about to become some kind of itinerant preacher. That is, firstly, pleasant and, secondly, necessary.\"\n\nAddressing his sister's concerns, Einstein writes: \"Don't worry about me, I myself don't worry either, even if it's not quite kosher, people are very upset. In Italy, it seems to be at least as bad.\"\n\nLater in 1922, Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics.\n\nZe'ev Rosenkrantz, the assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech, said the letter wasn't the first time Einstein warned about German anti-Semitism, but it captured his state of mind at this important junction after Rathenau's killing and the \"internal exile\" he imposed on himself shortly after it.\n\n\"Einstein's initial reaction was one of panic and a desire to leave Germany for good. Within a week, he had changed his mind,\" he said. \"The letter reveals a mindset rather typical of Einstein in which he claims to be impervious to external pressures. One reason may be to assuage his sister's concerns. Another is that he didn't like to admit that he was stressed about external factors.\"\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power and began enacting legislation against Jews, they also aimed to purge Jewish scientists. The Nazis dismissed Einstein's groundbreaking work, including his Law of Relativity, as \"Jewish Physics.\"\n\nEinstein renounced his German citizenship in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor. The physicist settled in the United States, where he would remain until his death in 1955.\n\nEinstein declined an invitation to serve as the first president of the newly established state of Israel but left behind his literary estate and personal papers to the Hebrew University.\n\n___\n\nFollow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThousands of Central American migrants decided to depart Mexico City early Friday and head toward the northern city of Tijuana, opting for the longer but likely safer route to the U.S. border, caravan organizers said.\n\nThe decision was made late Thursday in a Mexico City stadium where roughly 5,000 migrants have spent the past few days resting, receiving medical attention and debating to how to proceed with their trek. It came shortly after caravan representatives met with officials from the local United Nations office and demanded buses to take them to the border.\n\nCaravan coordinator Milton Benitez told the migrants that they were still waiting for a response. But he later told The Associated Press the officials had offered them buses for women and children only but organizers demanded that they be for everyone. U.N. representatives could not be immediately reached to confirm this.\n\nThe migrants held out hopes that buses would arrive for them Friday morning but decided to leave Mexico City even if they didn't.\n\n\"God, please let the buses arrive, but if not we will walk,\" said 18-year-old single mother Delia Murillo who left her girl in Honduras because she feared for her safety on the trek.\n\nAddressing the assembly in the Mexico City sports complex, organizer Walter Cuello yelled: \"Five in the morning Tijuana!\" The migrants responded with enthusiastic applause and shouts. The plan was to walk to the central Mexican city of Queretaro on Friday.\n\nSome migrants doubted the buses would arrive.\n\n\"There will be no buses,\" said Hector Wilfredo Rosales, a 46-year-old electrician from Olancho, Honduras, who was traveling with his 16-year-old son-in-law. \"They have lied to us a lot but we will walk like we have done so far.\"\n\nMexico City is more than 600 miles from the nearest U.S. border crossing at McAllen, Texas, and a previous caravan in the spring opted for a much longer route to Tijuana in the far northwest, across from San Diego. That caravan steadily dwindled to only about 200 people by the time it reached the border.\n\n\"California is the longest route but is the best border, while Texas is the closest but the worst\" border, said Jose Luis Fuentes of the National Lawyers Guild to gathered migrants.\n\nRosales said he would have preferred a shorter route \"because there are a lot of women with children with us and it is going to be very hard.\" But he agreed with the decision to leave Mexico City and hoped people along the way would give them lifts.\n\nThe migrants said they wanted buses to take them to the U.S. border because it is too hard and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking. Benitez noted that it would be colder in northern Mexico and it wasn't safe for the migrants to continue along highways, where drug cartels frequently operate.\n\n\"This is a humanitarian crisis and they are ignoring it,\" Benitez said as the group arrived at the U.N. office.\n\nThe Central American migrants began their arduous trek toward the United States more than three weeks ago and were turned by President Donald Trump into a campaign issue in the U.S. midterm elections.\n\nMexico has offered refuge, asylum or work visas to the migrants, and its government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they wait for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nBut most want to continue on toward the United States. Authorities say most have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries. About 85 percent of the migrants are from Honduras, while others are from the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\nOn Wednesday, a bus left from Mexico City to return 37 people to their countries of origin.\n\nThere have already been reports of migrants on the caravan going missing, though that is often because they hitch rides on trucks that turn off on different routes, leaving them lost.\n\nThe U.N. human rights agency said its office in Mexico had filed a report with prosecutors in the central state of Puebla about two buses that migrants boarded in the last leg of the trip to Mexico City early this week, and whose whereabouts are not known.\n\nIn Mexico City, the migrants received medical attention and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, diapers and other basics. They searched through piles of clothes and grabbed boxes of milk for children.\n\nMarlon Ivan Mendez, a farm worker from Copan, Honduras, waited in line for donated shoes to replace the worn crocs he has used since leaving his country three weeks ago. He said he left because gangs were charging him rent to live in his own home.\n\nMendez said it wasn't fair that people talk of the migrants as criminals or bad people with gang members in their midst.\n\n\"It is not just that the good ones pay for the sinners,\" he said.", "A Mississippi man was reportedly fired from his nursing job on Thursday after a viral photo showed him wearing a Confederate t-shirt -- emblazoned with a noose and the words \"Mississippi Justice\" -- while voting in the midterm elections.\n\nThe photograph, which was reportedly taken at a polling center near his home in Olive Branch, Miss., outraged fellow voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad time that people still have that mindset,\u201d resident Clarence Walker told FOX13 Memphis.\n\n\u201cWell, I was shocked when I saw it, but there wasn't anything we can do,\" Election Commissioner Barry Chatham told the Local Memphis.\n\n\u201cWell, I was shocked when I saw it, but there wasn't anything we can do.\" \u2014 Barry Chatham, Election Commissioner\n\nDeSoto County officials confirmed to FOX13 that the man didn\u2019t break any laws by wearing the divisive shirt to go vote.

They have denied any wrongdoing and have successfully fought many other corruption cases.\n\nImelda Marcos was acquitted Friday in three other cases, which were filed in 1991 and took nearly three decades of trial by several judges and prosecutors.

Instead, Scott and the NRSC argue, Bucher and her staff simply used their own judgment when determining voters' intent.\n\nThe suit against Bucher demands an injunction requiring Bucher to make and compare duplicate copies of all damaged absentee ballots in the presence of Scott's representatives, and to allow the Palm Beach County Canvassing Board to determine voters' intent when counting those ballots.\n\nRubio, in his barrage of broadsides against Snipes earlier in the day, pointed to the \"slow drip\" of tens of thousands of additional ballots that were reported throughout the day Thursday, most of which were favorable to several Democratic candidates.

Other places have the same problems, different problems. It\u2019s just that they are not spotlighted like we are.\u201d\n\nAt his Thursday press conference, Scott outlined some of Snipes' troubled history.\n\n\"In 2016, Brenda Snipes\u2019 office posted election results half an hour before polls closed \u2013 a violation of election law,\" Scott said. \"That same year, her office was sued for leaving amendments off of ballots. In 2014, Brenda Snipes\u2019 fellow Democrats accused her of individual and systemic breakdowns that made it difficult for voters to cast regular ballots. All Floridians should be concerned about that.\"\n\nVote totals in several major races in the state are changing rapidly, on an irregular schedule and sometimes late into the evening. Scott was ahead of Nelson by roughly one-fourth of one percentage point as of Thursday morning, according to The Tampa Bay Times. The paper also said the agriculture commissioner candidates were separated by only 0.06 points. That race flipped in favor of the Democratic candidate on Thursday afternoon.\n\nBroward County reported that significantly more votes were received in the agriculture commissioner contest than the much higher-profile Senate election. An attorney for Nelson's campaign suggested a computer error might explain that anomaly.\n\nIn the closely watched gubernatorial race, DeSantis held a narrow 0.52-percentage-point edge over Gillum as of Thursday morning, extremely close to the 0.5 percent threshold needed to trigger a machine recount. Gillum has conceded the race, although his decision is nonbinding.\n\nBut by Thursday afternoon, unofficial figures had DeSantis up by just 38,515 votes out of the more than 8 million cast -- a lead of just 0.47 percent, low enough to trigger a mandatory recount, according to The Tallahassee Democrat. No recount has yet been announced by Florida's secretary of state; the first unofficial vote count is expected to be verified Saturday.\n\n\"On Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count,\" Gillum's campaign said in a statement Thursday evening. \"Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported. Our campaign, along with our attorney Barry Richard, is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount.\"\n\nComplaint by Fox News on Scribd\n\nWithout providing legally sufficient justification, Rubio said, Democrat-controlled Broward and Palm Beach counties on Wednesday afternoon continued to report new ballots, cutting into Scott's already-thin lead and flipping the state's agriculture commissioner race to Democrats.\n\nPalm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher told Fox News that Palm Beach is still counting about 2,000 mail-in ballots where voters circled or highlighted (by drawing an arrow pointing at the candidate\u2019s name) their choice, instead of filling in the appropriate bubbles.\n\nBucher told Fox News that elections department staff is going through each of the 2,000 mail-in ballots, and where voter intent is determined, a worker is filling in a new ballot on behalf of the voter. Where voter intent cannot be determined, the ballot is sent to the canvassing board to undergo review.\n\nElections officials are also reviewing 1,500 military and overseas ballots which are still being counted. Florida law allows military servicemembers to mail or fax ballots in. A provisional vote report is due in Tallahassee on Saturday by noon.\n\n\"#Broward election supervisors ongoing violation of #Florida law requiring timely reporting isn\u2019t just annoying incompetence,\" Rubio wrote. \"It has opened the door for lawyers to come here & try to steal a seat in the U.S. Senate & Florida Cabinet.\"\n\nFlorida law dictates that if the margin in any race hits 0.25 percent or lower, a manual recount of any ballots set aside from the machine recount will be ordered -- reminiscent of the scene in the 2000 presidential election, when the country was gripped by images of poll workers counting votes deciphering hanging chads by hand.\n\nBroward County election officials did not return Fox News' multiple requests for comment.\n\nFox News' Heather Lacy contributed to this report.", "Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told then-President Barack Obama in the summer of 2014 that he could use \"very broad power\" to limit immigration as he saw fit, according to a letter obtained by Fox News.\n\nIn the July 29 letter, Feinstein cites Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act -- the same federal legislation cited by the Trump administration Thursday in unveiling a rule denying asylum claims to migrants who enter the country illegally.\n\n\"Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,\" the legislation states, \"he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\"\n\nFeinstein's letter initially notes that the senator has discussed possible legislation with then-Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Feinstein then writes: \"there is also an argument that there is sufficient flexibility in current law for the government to respond to the current crisis and that further legislation is not needed.\" She adds that the authority vested in the presidency by Section 212 (f) means that \"no legislation is necessary to give your administration the tools it needs to respond to this crisis, and that any needed temporary measures can be implemented through presidential action.\"\n\nIn response to Feinstein, then-acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Winkowski wrote that \"[w]hile there is no express prohibition on using the broad, general authority conferred by section 212(f) to help respond to the influx of unaccompanied children, any such use would require careful study ...\"\n\nRepresentatives for Feinstein did not immediately return emailed requests for comment. Since Trump's election, Feinstein has been a prominent critic of his immigration policy.\n\n\"There is an unprecedented crisis at our Southern border where aliens understand that they can enter the country illegally, avoid removal, and ultimately remain in the U.S. living and working illegally,\" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Michael Bars said in a statement. \"The congressionally delegated authority for our president to handle crises at our border appropriately is recognized historically as a bipartisan approach to solving some of the most endemic challenges to national security and public safety. By strengthening the integrity of our lawful immigration system, both the interests of the American people and legitimate asylum seekers properly presenting themselves at ports of entry prevail.\"", "More than a dozen U.S. state attorneys general signed a document Thursday calling for Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, a role he assumed following his temporary appointment following the resignation of Jeff Sessions.\n\nThe document was released on Twitter by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who tweeted that Whitaker \u201crecuse himself immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cActing AG Whitaker\u2019s hostility to the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation disqualifies him from overseeing Robert Mueller,\u201d Healey tweeted. \u201cDeputy Attorney General Rosenstein must be allowed to protect the Special Counsel and insulate the investigation from interference by the White House. #ProtectMueller\u201d\n\nAs part of Whitaker\u2019s new role as the head official at the Justice Department, he will oversee the Russia probe and the agency's other federal investigations, including the New York prosecutors' look into the finances of Trump and his former aides.\n\nIn an op-ed Whitaker wrote last year, he argued that \u201cany investigation into President Trump's finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller's appointment as special counsel.\u201d\n\n\"It is time for Rosenstein ... to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel,\" Whitaker wrote. \"If he doesn't, then Mueller's investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition. This would not only be out of character for a respected figure like Mueller, but also could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family -- and by extension, to the country.\u201d\n\nAnd separately, in July 2017, Whitaker told CNN, \"I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn\u2019t fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Healey, the document was signed by 17 other attorneys generals from New York, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey, California, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Rhode Island, Washington state, Virginia, New Mexico and Maryland.\n\nTOP DEMS DEMAND WHITAKER RECUSAL, SOUND ALARM AFTER SESSIONS\u2019 RESIGNATION: \u2018THIS IS A BREAK-THE-GLASS MOMENT\u2019\n\n\u201cBecause a reasonable person could question your impartiality in the matter, your recusal is necessary to maintain public trust in the integrity of the investigation and to protect the essential and longstanding independence of the Department you have been chosen to lead, on an acting basis,\u201d the letter addressed to Whitaker said.\n\nThe document goes on to discuss Whitaker\u2019s past comments about the Mueller investigation and adds that, in their capacity as prosecutors and law enforcement officials, the group feels \u201cthat the independent Special Counsel must have the full authority to investigate and, if warranted, prosecute any violations of federal law.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, the group of state attorneys general note that Rosenstein appears to have adequately overseen the Russia probe and \u201cshould continue to do so, as Mr. Mueller\u2019s work must proceed free from interference or supervision that would appear to many Americans to be biased.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "Thousands of liberal protesters streamed through the streets of New York City into Union Square on Thursday night to protest President Trump's firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions yesterday, in a rapidly organized demonstration that even some participants acknowledged was as high on irony as it was on enthusiasm.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence as the protesters demanded that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker step aside. Whitaker has written critically of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russian election meddling probe, which he now oversees.\n\nSome carried signs and banners saying, \"I love this country more than Trump hates it,\" \"This is what democracy looks like,\" \u201cRepeal, Replace Trump,\u201d and \"Hands off Mueller.\"\n\n\"The timing here is not a coincidence,\u201d Shannon Stagman, a member of the liberal group Empire State Indivisible, told Gothamist. \u201cDonald Trump acted while we were still embroiled in midterm elections because he wanted to catch us off guard.

We knew this would happen at some point -- the day has arrived.\u201d\n\nGroups including MoveOn and Rise and Resist helped organize the fray, as throngs of protesters headed from 7th Avenue to Union Square. Similar protests emerged across the country Thursday evening, but the one in New York was by far the largest.\n\nRACHEL MADDOW PROMOTES PRO-MUELLER STREET PROTESTS\n\nSome protesters even brought drums, according to posts on Twitter.\n\nBut as conservatives pointed to numerous cases in which prominent Democrats had previously called for Sessions' termination, some progressives admitted the situation was an unusual sign of the times.\n\n\"I cannot believe I'm going to have to march in anger at the fact that racist woodsprite Jeff Sessions lost his job, but here we are,\" liberal journalist Mark Harris wrote on Twitter.\n\nOn Thursday, top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee called for hearings into Sessions' firing.\n\n\u201cThere is little doubt that President Trump\u2019s decision to force the firing of Attorney General Sessions places Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s inquiry at grave risk,\u201d the Democrats wrote to Whitaker, before asking him to recuse himself and return Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to his role supervising the Russia investigation.\n\nSessions, on the advice of career Justice Department officials, recused himself from that role after reports emerged contradicting his testimony that he had not met with any Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign. That decision frustrated Trump, who considered it an unnecessarily betrayal.\n\nA 'BREAK-THE-GLASS MOMENT': DEMS SOUND ALARM AFTER SESSIONS GETS THE BOOT\n\n\u201cThere is little doubt that President Trump\u2019s decision to force the firing of Attorney General Sessions places Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s inquiry at grave risk,\u201d Democrats' letter to Whitaker reads.\n\nThe Democrats demanded that Whitaker preserve all documents pertaining to Trump's decision to push Sessions to resign, signaling that they intend to scrutinize them when they retake control of the Judiciary Committee after the new Congress is seated in January.\n\nNadler and the Democrats also demanded that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., hold emergency hearings and back legislation guaranteeing Mueller's job security.\n\n\u201c[T]he president now directly threatens the rule of law itself,\" they wrote. \"Democrats and Republicans [should] set aside partisanship to avoid a full-fledged constitutional crisis in the Watergate era. It is therefore necessary that we set aside our political interests and work together to protect our nation and the rule of law from this grave threat.\"\n\nIn his new capacity, Whitaker, who can hold his post for approximately six months without Senate confirmation, is the head official at the Justice Department. That means, at least for now, that he oversees the Mueller probe and the agency's other federal investigations, including the New York prosecutors' look into the finances of Trump and his former aides.\n\nThe DOJ is an Executive Branch department staffed by both career officials, who are shielded from arbitrary termination, and political appointees like Sessions and Whitaker who serve at the president's pleasure.\n\nWhitaker has previously written an op-ed in 2017 in which he argued that \"any investigation into President Trump's finances or the finances of his family would require Mueller to return to Rod Rosenstein for additional authority under Mueller's appointment as special counsel.\"\n\nWhitaker continued, \"If he were to continue to investigate the financial relationships without a broadened scope in his appointment, then this would raise serious concerns that the special counsel's investigation was a mere witch hunt.\" (Trump has repeatedly derided the Mueller probe as a \"witch hunt,\" characterizing it as a partisan effort to detract from his accomplishments in office.)\n\n\"It is time for Rosenstein ... to order Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to the four corners of the order appointing him special counsel,\" Whitaker concluded. \"If he doesn't, then Mueller's investigation will eventually start to look like a political fishing expedition. This would not only be out of character for a respected figure like Mueller, but also could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family -- and by extension, to the country.\"\n\nAnd in July 2017, Whitaker told CNN, \"I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn\u2019t fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nAt a press conference earlier Wednesday at the White House, Trump emphasized that he could order Justice Department officials to end the Mueller investigation at any point.\n\n\"I could fire everybody right now, but I don't want to stop it because politically I don't like stopping it,\" Trump said. \"I am not concerned about anything with the Russian investigation, because it is a hoax. There is no collusion.\"\n\nDemocrats united Wednesday to demand Whitaker's recusal, with some citing his previous writings and statements as supporting the notion that he will be improperly biased. (Republicans made a similar argument, rejected by Democrats, that the political biases expressed by now-fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok, a key player in the Russia and Hillary Clinton probes, should have disqualified him from working on the cases.)\n\n\"I think what ultimately the president is going to start doing is putting pressure on Rod J. Rosenstein, who is in charge of this investigation, is acting attorney general, and really try to get Rod to maybe even cut the budget of Bob Mueller and do something a little more stage crafty than the blunt instrument of firing the attorney general and trying to replace him,\" Whitaker said in a July interview.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.", "U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Thursday that North Korea canceled this week's talks between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official, but a meeting between the two nations' leaders is still on for after Jan. 1.\n\n\"I don't think there was some major issue\" for the postponement, she said. \"I have talked with the administration and basically what we're looking at is they postponed it because they weren't ready.\"\n\nPompeo was supposed to meet with Kim Yong Chol in New York on Thursday to discuss the North's commitment to eliminating its nuclear weapons and arrangements for a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"I do think the talks are going to be rescheduled,\" Haley said of the Pompeo-Kim Yong Chol meeting. \"And it doesn't change the fact that that summit is still scheduled for the president and Kim to meet after the first of the year.\"\n\nHaley spoke to reporters ahead of U.N.

And she added: \"We know they've been doing some things with the financial aspect of it.\"\n\nAs she left the closed council meeting, Haley said humanitarian exemptions were discussed.\n\nShe said earlier that the U.S. goal is to make sure aid goes to people in need, not the regime, so it is investigating technical aspects of a number of requests to make sure aid is not re-routed.\n\n\"So we're going to take our time to do that,\" she said.\n\nBut Haley said Russia's real aim came out at the end of the council consultations.\n\n\"What they're looking for is to lift banking restrictions, which are exactly some of the things we know they're not following through on appropriately,\" Haley said. \"So now we know what their agenda is.
