Switzerland isn't a member of the 28-nation bloc.\n\nIn order to open a formal investigation into a lawmaker, prosecutors have to first ask for that person's immunity to be lifted.\n\nAlternative for Germany, which placed third in national elections last year, acknowledged this week that Weidel's local party chapter received the money from Switzerland, which was marked \"campaign donation Alice Weidel.\" The Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger reported that the payments were listed as coming from a company named PWS Pharmawholesale International AG.\n\nGerman media reported Wednesday that Weidel used part of the money to pay for social media advertising during her election campaign and for a lawyer suing journalists on her behalf.\n\nAlternative for Germany confirmed she used the funds to pay bills, but said she later ordered the donations returned after doubts were raised about their legality.\n\nLate Wednesday, Alternative for Germany released a statement saying it had informed parliament of a separate donation of 150,000 euros to Weidel's local chapter from a Belgian foundation called Stichting Identiteit Europa.

Chris Coons, is unnecessary because Trump has not suggested he will fire Mueller.\n\n\"Sen.

That's a worrying indicator for May, who will likely require support from opposition Labour members of Parliament to win final approval of the agreement.\n\nPro-Brexit lawmakers in May's Conservative Party say the agreement will leave Britain tethered to the EU after it departs and unable to forge an independent trade policy. In a warning to her opponents, May said the choice was between her deal, \"or leave with no deal; or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nFormer Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who resigned earlier this year amid disagreements with May about Brexit strategy, told ITV News Wednesday that the draft agreement was \"vassal state stuff.\"\n\n\"We are going to be kept in a kind of economic and political captivity, unable to shape EU legislation and regulation, but having to accept it,\" Johnson said. \" ... I cannot see how, in a month of Sundays, that can be acceptable to anybody who campaigned for Brexit.

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier declared there had been \"decisive progress,\" signaling that EU leaders can convene a summit to approve the deal, probably later his month. If all sides approve, the agreement would come into effect on March 29 of next year.\n\nCrucially, Barnier said that \"we have now found a solution together with the U.K. to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\"\n\nThe main obstacle to a withdrawal agreement has long been how to ensure there are no customs posts or other checks along the border between the U.K.'s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Britain and the EU agree that there must be no barriers that could disrupt businesses and residents on either side of the border and undermine Northern Ireland's hard-won peace process.\n\nThe solution in the agreement involves a \"single EU-U.K. customs territory,\" to eliminate the need for border checks.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the U.K. will agree to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental standards and workplace protections -- another source of anger for Brexiteers, who say Britain should be free to set its own rules.\n\nThe draft agreement also mentions potential \"Northern Ireland-specific regulatory alignment\" to avoid a hard border.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, has said it will oppose any deal that leaves Northern Ireland subject to different rules to the rest of the U.K. after Brexit.\n\n\"We could not as unionists support a deal that broke up the United Kingdom,\" DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Cuba said Wednesday that it is ending a program that sent thousands of government doctors to underserved regions of Brazil in exchange for hundreds of millions in badly needed hard currency.\n\nThe end of the \"Mas Medicos,\" or \"More Doctors,\" program signals a sharp deterioration in relations between communist Cuba and Brazil, which just elected far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro. He takes office Jan. 1.\n\nCuba made the announcement after Bolsonaro said the program overseen by the World Health Organization could only continue if doctors directly received their salaries from Brazil, and were able to bring their families with them during their assignments, among other conditions.\n\nThe Cuban government generally keeps most of the salaries of state employees working abroad as part of the socialist state's \"international missions.\" Participants also are generally barred from bringing family members in a measure that critics say is designed to prevent doctors from emigrating.\n\n\"Mas Medicos\" started five years ago under leftist President Dilma Rousseff. Cuba said roughly 20,000 doctors saw millions of patients in areas such as the Amazon rainforest and slums of major cities.\n\nCuba maintains similar missions in 67 other countries but \"Mas Medicos\" was one of the largest and most important, serving as a link between the cash-strapped island and South America's largest economy.\n\n\"Cubans have provided a valuable service to the Brazilian people with dignity, deep sensitivity, professionality, dedication and altruism,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter. \"Such humane acts should be respected and defended.\"\n\nAll Cuban doctors work for the state and virtually all receive salaries that are well below $100 a month. Doctors are not permitted to leave Cuba without government permission, a control that was lifted for virtually all other Cubans five years ago.\n\nThousands of Cuban doctors work in the island's public health-care system, which suffers from crumbling infrastructure but still provides free and universal health care to all citizens. Thousands of other Cuban doctors go abroad each year and generate billions of dollars for the state, one of Cuba's most important sources of foreign exchange.\n\nThe doctors generally receive a fraction of the salary paid to the Cuban government. But even that fraction far exceeds the salaries of doctors working in Cuba. That drives many doctors to complete foreign missions in order to earn cash for important expenses like home repairs, appliances or a motor vehicle.\n\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health said there were 8,332 Cuban doctors in Brazil, each costing the country roughly $3,100 a month, plus room and board.\n\nBolsonaro said Brazil would offer asylum to Cuban doctors who wished to stay in Brazil.\n\n\"This is slave labor,\" he said. \"We couldn't be accomplices.\"\n\nNeither side said exactly when the Cuban doctors would be leaving but their departure comes at a bad time for Cuba, which is facing its third year of slow growth, expected to be around 1 percent this year.

The lack of warning is suspected of playing a role in the Lion Air crash, when the plane plunged into the Jakarta Sea shortly after takeoff. It was the first fatal crash involving one of Boeing\u2019s newest aircraft and claimed 189 lives.\n\nThe Journal also reported on Tuesday that when Boeing decided to install the flight-control feature, the company determined that it was fail-proof because it was impossible for the combination of sensor failure, pilot actions, and automated nose-down commands to cause any serious safety hazards.\n\nThe newspaper also reviews a Nov. 10 Memo from Southwest Airlines, one of the U.S. carriers to start using the MAX jets, in which it\u2019s claimed that Boeing had omitted information from flight manuals about the new flight control system, because pilots were unlikely to find themselves in any situation that would require them to use the system.\n\nIn response to the fatal crash, the Federal Flight Administration (FAA) has launched a comprehensive review of safety analysis completed by Boeing Co. On Tuesday, it released a statement saying that agency officials were reviewing safety data and conclusions that the jet manufacturer previously provided to the federal agency during certification of both the 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 models.\n\n\u201cThe existing FAA Airworthiness Directive (AD) identifies existing flight crew procedures to be used in those circumstances,\u201d reads a statement from administration officials. \u201cThe FAA and Boeing continue to evaluate the need for software and/or other design changes to the aircraft including operating procedures and training as we learn more from the ongoing investigation. The FAA is not doing a safety probe separate from the ongoing Lion Air Accident investigation of which we, the NTSB and Indonesian officials are a part.\u201d\n\nBoth Boeing and the FAA issued a safety alert last week telling flight crews about the system and how to handle malfunctions.\n\n\u201cOn November 6, 2018, Boeing issued an Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) directing operators to existing flight crew procedures to address circumstances where there is erroneous input from an [angle of attack] sensor,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said in a statement provided to Fox Business.\n\nBoeing has said it is fully cooperating with any reviews and conducting its own investigation of the Lion Air crash.\n\n\u201cWe have been very engaged with the investigative authorities throughout in providing all of the information necessary to make sure we do a full assessment of the situation,\u201d Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in an exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network on Tuesday. \u201cThe bottom line here is the 737 MAX is safe and safety is a core value for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to Muilenburg, the company spends \u201cthousands of hours of testing and evaluating and simulating\u201d to give pilots the information they need to operate airplanes safely and he reiterated that the equipment operates correctly.\n\nThe brand new Boeing MAX 8 jet involved in the crash was cleared to fly despite days of inaccurate speed readings. About 15 minutes into the flight, which took off from Jakarta, the plane plunged into the sea.\n\nThere are more than 200 Boeing MAX jets around the world, with orders for more than 4,700, according to Boeing\u2019s website. U.S. carriers, aside from Southwest, set to use the MAX jets include American and United Airlines.\n\nFox Business Network's Julia Limitone and Brittany De Lea contributed reporting to this story.", "Hey guys, look what I found.\n\nA wildlife refuge in Florida has posted a graphic image of a bobcat walking around with a dead iguana in its mouth, showing off its kill for tourists.\n\nThe Arthur R.

That was unusual, as the ancient Greeks typically buried their dead in organized cemeteries outside the city walls.\n\nOLDEST WRITTEN RECORD OF HOMER'S 'ODYSSEY' MAY HAVE BEEN FOUND ON THIS CLAY TABLET\n\nRelatively little is known about Tenea, apart from ancient references to the reputed link with Troy and to its citizens forming the bulk of the Greek colonists who founded the city of Syracuse in Sicily.\n\nLead archaeologist Elena Korka, who has been excavating in the area since 2013, told The Associated Press that her team had only been digging in the rich cemeteries surrounding Tenea until this year.

But that's a pledge that should hardly be trusted, many officials contend.\n\nGiven those security concerns, selecting a 12-person jury was, not surprisingly, no easy affair. On Tuesday, two jurors ahead to be replaced ahead of opening statements. One juror, who was kept despite bursting into tears last week, presented a medical note for dismissal. Another expressed financial hardship.\n\nDuring jury selection, one member of the jury pool was rushed to hospital after suffering a panic attack. Several potential jurors expressed \u201cextreme anxiety,\u201d and another said she was \u201cnervous,\u201d and feared for her family because they lived close to the courthouse. That's where Chapo is being kept, in a newly-built basement cell to avoid traffic disruptions.\n\nSome admitted to having googled search terms related to Chapo and killing jurors. Others said they were worried about identifying factors already having been made public. One would-be juror said co-workers had already suspected she was in the final selection group \u2013 made up of U.S. citizens from Brooklyn, Long Island, and Staten Island.\n\nAt the Brooklyn courthouse, where he sits in his solitary cell, swarms of security officers and bomb-sniffing dogs are patrolling around the clock. And those measures are expected to be in place for at least four months - the expected length of the trial.\n\n\u201cThe Eastern Division New York Police Department (EDNY) and the U.S. Marshals Service are very experienced with high-profile trials and related jury safety and tampering issues,\u201d said Derek Maltz, former Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration Special Operations Division in New York. \u201cBut in the current world we live in, with information access and leaks, I would be concerned from the juror\u2019s perspective, since there are so many ways to disclose the identities of the people.\u201d\n\nThe Marshals Service, a Department of Justice agency, serves as the main agency for federal fugitive operations, the protection of officers of the federal judiciary, and the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System. That all puts the Guzm\u00e1n trial in their sphere of security.\n\nGuzm\u00e1n has pleaded not guilty to all 17 counts in the indictment, which accuses him of heading global operations for Mexico\u2019s infamous Sinaloa Cartel. The U.S. had to quietly drop homicide charges from his indictment to ensure death penalty was taken off the table, making the extradition possible.\n\nThe accused drug kingpin has long been known to have ordered the brutal murders of dozens \u2013 rivals, dissidents, suspected snitches, government officials or anyone who might have mildly fallen into his crosshairs. He has twice escaped from Mexico\u2019s prisons, and effectively ran his cartel business and ordered killings from behind bars. As a result, he's currently in solitary confinement 23 hours per day.\n\nMANIPULATION, FEAR, SNITCHES, AND A NEW CELL: BEHIND THE SCENES AS EL CHAPO GOES TO TRIAL\n\nQUESTIONS ARISE OVER POLITICS, MOTIVATION OF CARAVAN ORGANIZERS\n\nRobert Clark, retired FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the Los Angeles bureau, said Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s destructive impact on human lives spanned into the thousands \u2013 and that\u2019s just on the direct scale.\n\n\u201cIf you consider the fact he was the largest supplier of cocaine and marijuana, he has negatively impacted millions of lives,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe violence has touched so many. However, the fear that the Sinaloa Cartel perpetrates is immeasurable.\u201d\n\nClark also pointed out the jury \u201cwill be most difficult to seat the protect.\u201d He also predicted that \u201cwithin the jury, corruption will be an issue. The influence of Sinaloa and Chapo is vast and deep,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prosecutors especially will have to be very careful - the threat is very real.\u201d\n\nSinaloa is believed to have a network worldwide, including cells inside the United States.\n\n\u201cThese people think nothing of killing anyone they don\u2019t like, man or woman,\u201d one U.S. official said. \u201cThey\u2019ll decapitate, cut limbs off, shoot, drown, cut you up. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\nDuring earlier hearings, which Guzm\u00e1n often attended, law enforcement officials expressed concern over some of the \u201cfreelance journalists\u201d in attendance. They speculated that some may have been or were working for cartel snoops, trying to ascertain early information to identify jurors, or forge relationships with those in the know.\n\nFederal Judge Brian Mr. Cogan, 64, who has served on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York since 2006, is handling the case, and his known for his ruthless efficiency, calm temperament and compassion. He, too, has been given extra protection.\n\n\u201cProsecutors, judges, and a whole range of personnel accept some risk to their safety, with little public recognition of the risks they are taking,\u201d said Evan Ellis, Research Professor of Latin American Studies at tje U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies Institute.\n\nWhile prosecutors have claimed they have unsurmountable evidence to ensure Chapo is put behind bars for life \u2013 including documents, videos and audio recordings related to the Sinaloa cartel and Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s orchestration \u2013 his defense team argues he was merely a mid-level manager for the cartel, and hardly the mythical villain he seems.\n\nWhatever the case, security experts are confident that jurors and others at the trial will be kept safe.\n\n\u201cKnowing the U.S. Marshals service, they have a lot of resources dedicated to safeguarding El Chapo\u2019s trial. Security and safety are their number one priority. They always do a great job and know exactly what is needed to protect the public and those involved with the trial,\u201d said Joaquin Garcia, a retired FBI Special Agent and Managing Director at Pathfinder Consultants International, Inc.\n\nLenny DePaul, a retired Chief Inspector and Commander of the Marshals Service in New York, concurred.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m well aware of the capabilities of the Marshals Service, and what they will do to keep them (the jurors) completely obscured from the public,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will never be identified publicly, unless they come forward post-trial.\u201d\n\nBut that is where the trouble could begin. Long after the verdict is handed down, those involved will have to watch their backs - and their mouths.\n\n\u201cSome of the jurors should be careful after the trial; if they think about capitalizing on big paydays for playing a role in the drug trial of the century. This is where it will become very dangerous,\u201d Maltz said. \u201cThey should do their job, enjoy the opportunity and keep a low profile.\u201d", "Rep.

Jordan is a prominent member of the House Freedom Caucus and an ally of President Trump.\n\nMcCarthy \"knows what he needs to do,\" said GOP Whip Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who was gravely wounded in last year's congressional baseball practice shooting. On Tuesday, Scalise unanimously won re-election to the No. 2 spot as whip.\n\n\"You always look in the mirror and see what you can do better,\" Scalise said Tuesday. Republicans, he said, \"need to do a better job of letting people know what we stand for.\"\n\nMcCarthy takes over the role of GOP leader in the House with the retirement of current House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and at a time when Republicans will be the minority party in the lower of Congress for the first time since 2011.\n\nMcCarthy enjoyed the backing of the retiring Ryan, who earlier this year called the California Republican the \u201cright person\u201d to lead the party in the House, and also a close relationship with both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nThe new minority leader has spent much of his political career paying it forward by holding fundraisers and championing the pet bills of other GOP lawmakers.\n\nOne issue that was seen as standing in his way to the leadership role was that he is a moderate \u2013 some would argue at times liberal \u2013 Republican in a party that has in recent years trended farther and farther toward the right. Some members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus cited his moderate views as a reason why he wasn\u2019t selected for Republican leadership during a failed 2015 bid.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not speaker now because he\u2019s got a fairly liberal Republican track record,\u201d Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., a member of the Freedom Caucus, told a local Alabama radio station earlier this year.\n\nThis opened up the door for Jordan, a founding member and former chair of the Freedom Caucus, to try to upset McCarthy in the battle for GOP leadership.\n\nWhile Jordan enjoyed support from members of his own Freedom Caucus - and from having a smaller and more conservative Republican minority in the House - he simply didn't have wide enough support to defeat McCarthy.\n\n\u201cJordan comes with a lot of baggage,\u201d Bruce Oppenheimer, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University, told Fox News. \u201cRepublicans now have to work with a Democratic majority and they are going to have to decide if they want somebody who is both substantively more conservative, but also extremely more unreasonable in the leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a loose cannon,\u201d he added. \u201cJordan is a bomb thrower.\u201d\n\nThe election of Cheney makes her the only woman in House Republican leadership \u2014 and has her following in the footsteps of her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who won the same post more than 30 years ago.\n\nCheney is expected to spearhead the House GOP\u2019s communications strategy when Democrats take over the chamber in January. House Republicans are looking for a more forceful approach to communications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the way that we operate and really in some ways be more aggressive, have more of a rapid response,\u201d Cheney told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\nCheney ran unopposed after the current chair of the conference, Rep.

Doctors have suspected the cause might be some kind of enterovirus, which in most people causes cold symptoms. But CDC officials say that's not clear.\n\nThe first mysterious wave of paralysis cases in 2014 coincided with a wider spike in illnesses connected to an enterovirus called EV-D68, CDC officials said. But there was no such spike during the waves in 2016 or this year.\n\nThere's also a lack of clinical evidence: CDC officials have checked the spinal fluid of about three-quarters of the 90 patients, and found EV-68 in only one. Another type of enterovirus called EV-A71 was found in only one other patient.\n\nBut there are questions about that, too. If a virus is the cause, it's possible the test is not good enough, or the germ left the spinal fluid by the time the tests were taken, said the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier. It's also possible the culprit is hiding elsewhere in the body.\n\nOr perhaps the paralyzing illnesses are caused by some new germ for which no lab test has been developed. Or maybe there's some predisposing factor in some patients that cause their immune systems to react so severely to a germ or other trigger that the immune response causes paralysis, CDC officials said.\n\nUS OFFICIALS REPORT A RECORD NUMBER OF TICK DISEASES\n\nParents and even some scientists have criticized the agency for not solving the riddle.\n\n\"I understand why parents are frustrated. I'm frustrated. I want answers too,\" said Messonnier, who is overseeing the agency's outbreak investigation. CDC officials have pledged to do more to notify doctors to look for possible cases and to more thoroughly review cases from years past for further clues.\n\nAbout 120 cases were confirmed in 2014, the first time such a wave occurred. Another 149 were reported in 2016. In 2015 and 2017, the counts were far lower, and it's not clear why.\n\nThe illnesses have spiked in September each year there's been a wave and tailed off significantly by November. But it can take weeks to determine which cases should be counted in the outbreak. More than 160 cases are still being investigated, and some of those may join the count, CDC officials said.", "It began with a cryptic 911 call from Denise Closs's cell phone. No one spoke directly to the police dispatcher, who heard distant voices and loud commotion before the call ended.\n\nWhen authorities arrived four minutes later at the Barron, Wisconsin, house, they found Closs and her husband, James, shot to death inside their home and the couple's 13-year-old daughter, Jayme, missing.\n\nThe phone from which the call was made lay on the floor inside the modest, taupe-colored home.\n\n\"The phone isn\u2019t near anyone so I don\u2019t know if it got kicked,\" Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald of Barron County told Fox News on Tuesday. \"It was closer to Denise than to James.\"\n\n\"No one talked on that call and we don't know who made it. We heard voices but we can\u2019t make out what was said,\" he said, adding that it sounded as though the call was made in a room separate from the commotion.\n\n\"We do believe Jayme was home at the time the call was made,\" Fitzgerald noted.\n\nWith no suspects, no sighting of the child and scarce physical evidence one month after the Oct. 15 murders, police in the small town of Barron are scrutinizing the few clues they have, starting with the mysterious 911 call and a front door riddled with bullet holes.\n\nFitzgerald would not say whether the killer shot through the door but local news footage shows investigators carrying it away from the scene -- covered with what looks like bullet holes. Fitzgerald confirmed to Fox News that the door was undergoing forensic analysis. He also would not elaborate on the type of gun used in the crimes, citing the sensitivity of the investigation. James Closs kept hunting rifles inside the home but all have been accounted for.\n\n\"There\u2019s not a lot of physical evidence,\" he said. \"We took the door and anything that they [the killer] possibly could have touched.\"\n\nBoth mother and daughter attended a family birthday party at around 4 p.m. on Oct. 14 at the home of Denise Closs's sister, Jennifer Smith, who lives on the other side of town. At around 10 p.m. that night, Smith spoke with Closs by phone from her home. Nothing appeared amiss, according to family and police.\n\n\"At 10 p.m. we know everybody was at the house and accounted for,\" Fitzgerald told Fox News.\n\nAt just past 1 a.m. local time on Oct. 15, the 911 call was placed to the sheriff\u2019s office from Denise Closs's cell. When the call ended abruptly, a dispatcher called the landline at the family's home but it was disconnected.\n\nPolice arrived four minutes after the initial call to the Closs home on Highway 8 and found the body of James Closs in the front doorway; his wife's was inside the home. There was no sign of Jayme, except for her cell phone, which was reportedly found plugged into an outlet in the kitchen.\n\nThe motive of the crime remains elusive. With two parents dead, their young daughter missing and no obvious sign of theft at the home, investigators are struggling to answer a key question: Why?\n\n\"I\u2019m really looking to see if they were targeted or if it was a random attack,\" Fitzgerald said. \"This is the question I think about every night before I go to bed.\"\n\n\"It appears targeted but I can't 100 percent say that it is,\" he said. \"And I don't know who the target was.\"\n\nRelatives of the Closs family, meanwhile, said they are conviced the brutal murders and apparent abduction were carefully planned.\n\n\"If this was random, it wouldn't -- there'd be more evidence,\" Steve Naiberg, the girl's uncle, said in an exclusive interview Monday with Fox affiliate KMSP-TV and other family members.\n\n\"I think this was targeted -- planned,\" said Suzi Allard, Jayme's aunt.\n\nA relative described Denise Closs to Fox News as the \"family angel.\" The 46-year-old mother \"would take off work days if you needed help,\" said the relative, who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nThe family also strongly refuted a local rumor that Jayme -- described as quiet and well-liked -- had a secret, older boyfriend, according to the station.\n\n\u201cWe just want Jayme home,\" added Smith. \"We want to know why all of this happened -- just wish we had some answers and hoping for that miracle of Jayme coming home.\"\n\nFox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.", "Tom Bevan, Executive Editor Of Realclearpolitics.com, joined Fox News Radio's Marie Harf to discuss polling the midterm election.\n\nOn how the pollsters did in 2018: Pretty good. I thought the pollsters did a decent job. There were some states that we didn't have a lot of data in, but generic national vote pretty spot on. Our RealClearPolitics average was right about where it ended up. Ironically enough, the one state where we had the most polling, which was Florida, was a surprise. (5:25)\n\nOn Florida: I think it is a hard state to poll. I think harder than many because there are so many different components to it, but at the end of the day it comes down to what do pollsters think the electorate is going to look like on Election Day, who is going to turn out and vote. (7:50)\n\nOn when they start 2020 polling: We haven't started aggregating any polling on 2020. There have been a couple polls on 2020 and at this point they don't mean anything. It's all name id. It's Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. But, clearly the race has started and you've seen now more and more folks saying they're going to get in. I'm excited about it.

We intend to file an amicus brief with the U.S. District Court. Secret Service passes for working White House journalists should never be weaponized. While we don't condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press at recent media avails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people,\" Fox News President Jay Wallace said in a statement.\n\nHoward Kurtz, host of Fox News Channel's\"MediaBuzz\" and author of the new book \"Media Madness: Donald Trump, The Press, And The War Over The Truth,\" joined Fox News Radio's Marie Harf to give his take on CNN's lawsuit against the Trump administration.\n\nOn news outlets supporting CNN: By revoking his credentials the White House sort of went to death con one and now the reason you have NBC and CBS and ABC and FOX and other news organizations not just backing CNN but actually filing court briefs is that there's a consensus that even though Acosta is not the idle poster boy for freedom of the press they can't sit by while the White House says we're going to banish this reporter. You can not call on him. You can freeze him out, but to take away his credentials so he can't even get in past the gates I think has almost forced many news outlets to side with CNN. (1:10)\n\nOn Acosta being denied access by Secret Service in France: The Secret Service is doing it's job. Interestingly, the Secret Service agent who told Jim Acosta that first day, 'I'm sorry you can't come past the gates,' he was named in the lawsuit too. It wasn't his decision. He's like the cop on the corner. (5:53)\n\nOn the court of public opinion on the White House: I think in the court of public opinion both sides are playing to their base. CNN now has a largely anti-Trump audience, which is cheering it on cheers on Jim Acosta. CNN has made no attempt to reign in Jim Acosta, who likes to debate rather than question the President and it's audience probably loves it. The President's supporters hate the media, don't like CNN, particularly don't like Jim Acosta and are applauding the fact that he put Acosta in his place.

She said the caller told her to only listen but not to speak and threatened: \"We've come in two work teams, two work teams just for you.\"\n\nAn official close to the French investigation said Wednesday that police in the city of Lyon, where Interpol is headquartered, closed their probe into the call and Meng's detention having found no evidence that a crime was committed in France. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nMeng Hongwei \u2014 who was China's vice minister of public security while also leading Interpol \u2014 was detained while on a trip to China in September. A long-time Communist Party insider with decades of experience in China's sprawling security apparatus, the 64-year-old is the latest high-ranking official to fall victim to a sweeping purge against allegedly corrupt or disloyal officials under President Xi Jinping's authoritarian administration.\n\nChinese authorities have said Meng is being lawfully investigated for taking bribes and other crimes. His wife says the bribery accusation is just an excuse for a lengthy detention and that he is being persecuted for political reasons. On Sept. 25, he sent a text message to her from China of an emoji of a knife \u2014 suggesting to her he was in danger.\n\nGrace Meng said the man whose nighttime call frightened her in early October gave just one clue about his identity: that he used to work for Meng, suggesting the man was part of China's security apparatus. He also said he knew where she was.\n\nFrench police subsequently investigated the call but determined there was no evidence of a threat or that a crime was committed, the official close to the probe said.\n\nReached Wednesday by telephone, Grace Meng told the AP that she wasn't aware of the investigation's closure.

Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, have been accused of an \"immoral waste of taxpayers' money\" and being out of touch with their constituents as the chorus of complaints grows louder over the incentive-laden package put together by the Democrats to lure Amazon to the Big Apple.\n\nThe comments come as residents and politicians from within the Democratic Party voice their displeasure with what they perceive as too sweet a deal for Amazon to set up shop in Long Island City, a diverse Queens neighborhood they say has long been in need of improvements in affordable housing, education and infrastructure.\n\n\"True progressive leaders of the Democratic Party do not throw corporate welfare at the richest man in the world,\" New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who represents the area, told Fox News. \"Jeff Bezos, Amazon Cuomo, and Mayor de Blasio got in a room and cut out the people who this deal is going to affect, whose money will be spent to make it all possible.\"\n\nVan Bramer added in a separate interview with Politico that both Cuomo and De Blasio -- two of the most powerful Democrats in the state \u2013 \u201cmisread the moment\u201d and how much of a backlash the deal for Amazon to bring one of its headquarters there would generate.\n\n\u201cI think if the takeaway from the recent election in Queens, New York City and nationally is that we should actually step up corporate subsidies and billionaires getting billion-dollar bailouts \u2014 if that\u2019s the takeaway, somebody's not got their fingers on the pulse of Democrats, certainly, but people generally in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nVan Bramer is not alone amongst his party. New York Congress member-elect and Democratic Socialist darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez railed against Amazon Tuesday for getting tax breaks, citing community \"outrage,\" while City Council Speaker Corey Johnson questioned why such a wealthy company needs more than $1 billion in public money for their expansion plans.\n\nRon Kim, an assemblyman who represents another part of the Queens borough, has even gone as far as to file legislation hoping to block some of the subsidies being offered to Amazon from taking effect.\n\n\"Giving Jeff Bezos hundreds of millions of dollars is an immoral waste of taxpayers' money when it's more than clear that the money would create more jobs and more economic growth when it is used to relieve student debt,\" Kim said in a statement obtained by Fox News.\n\nIn a co-authored New York Times Op-Ed, Kim and Zephyr Teachout, who ran against Cuomo in the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial primary, wrote: \"The company does not seek partnership; it seeks control. Seattle\u2019s experience shows that becoming dependent on Amazon did not lead to broader wealth; it has pushed up home prices and led to increased homelessness. Amazon also threw its political weight around in the city, spending millions in a brutal campaign to resist corporate taxes in Seattle.\"\n\n\"It would be a special insult in New York City to sell out to a company so closely identified with squashing small merchants, stifling workers\u2019 rights and undermining the publishing and ideas industry.\"\n\n\"New York has a long, strong history of union power, and Amazon has a long history of union busting. In a 45-minute video leaked by Gizmodo, Amazon\u2019s anti-union tactics were revealed, as Whole Foods team leaders were instructed in how to quell unionization after Amazon bought the company.\"\n\nThe duo called on the public to see correspondences between the Cuomo administration and Amazon to learn more about what promises have been made.\n\nThe New York State Republican Party's spokesperson, in an email to Fox News, also called it the \"worst example yet in a very long line of disastrous corporate welfare giveaways under Cuomo while New York continues to rank dead last in business friendliness with the highest taxes & regs, worst economic outlook and most outmigration.\"\n\nAmazon, which revealed Long Island City and Northern Virginia as the locations of its next headquarters in a formal announcement Tuesday, boasted that their investments \u201cwill spur the creation of tens of thousands of additional jobs in the surrounding communities\u201d -- and that hiring will begin in 2019.\n\n\u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come,\u201d Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, said in a statement. \u201cThe team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities.\u201d\n\nFor the New York location, the company says it will generate 25,000 full-time jobs and $2.5 billion in Amazon investment, as well as an \u201cestimated incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over the next 20 years as a result of Amazon\u2019s investment and job creation.\"\n\nAmazon also appears to be taking advantage of a federal \"opportunity zone.\" The Associated Press says much of the Long Island City neighborhood falls into that designation, which was created in President Trump's tax overhaul and offers developers up to millions of dollars in capital gains tax breaks for investing in areas with high poverty and low incomes.\n\n\"Amazon has agreed to donate space on its campus for a tech startup incubator and for use by artists and industrial businesses, and Amazon will donate a site for a new primary or intermediary public school,\u201d the company added, noting that it will \u201calso invest in infrastructure improvements and new green spaces.\u201d\n\nBut each of those new jobs are expected to cost New Yorkers $48,000 each, and are part of a larger package of more than $1.5 billion in taxpayer-funded incentives which include such freebies as a helipad on or near the development sites.\n\n\u201cWe should be demanding that they give back to the community and not drain public resources.

Because Amazon wanted to move to a place where they knew they would have an expedited facility being constructed and that\u2019s our way of doing it.\"\n\nJohnson reportedly was among the invitees to that press conference Tuesday at Cuomo\u2019s New York City office \u2013 but he and other council members appeared to give the governor the cold shoulder by not attending.\n\nJonathan Tepper, an investor and author of the book \"The Myth of Capitalism,\" said of the agreement: \"Amazon's HQ2 makes me want to vomit. It perfectly captures how corrupt American crony capitalism has become.\n\n\"The government should not be in the business of throwing money at businesses to 'create jobs' -- that is what businesses are supposed to do as a matter of course,\" he added.\n\nThose living in the largest public housing project in America \u2013 only a handful of blocks away from the proposed Amazon Long Island City site -- also are skeptical as to how the incoming Amazon jobs will benefit them.\n\n\u201cThis community needs jobs, but we have trades, no degrees,\u201d Demetrius Loving, a 45-year-old resident of the Queensbridge Houses, told the New York Post. \u201cThey could save this community with that money!\u201d\n\nFox News' Chris Ciaccia contributed to this report.", "Russian military units in the Arctic jammed GPS signals being used during largescale NATO exercises in Norway that ended last week, the Norwegian Defense Ministry said Tuesday.\n\nNorway\u2019s Foreign Ministry \u201cwas aware that jamming has been recorded between Oct. 16 and Nov. 7 from the Russian forces\u201d on the Arctic Kola peninsula, it said in an email to the Associated Press.

The reconciliation was sponsored by Cardinal Bechara al-Rai, head of the Maronite church, Lebanon's largest.\n\nGeagea and Frangieh met in the past, but Wednesday marked the end of a bitter rivalry tainted with blood.\n\n\"It is so nice for brothers to sit together. I welcome you through prayers as happiness fills my heart and the heart of all Lebanese,\" al-Rai said in a speech after the two leaders met in front of journalists.\n\nThe two leaders are Maronite Christian and are both presidential hopefuls. Their reconciliation comes at a time when both their relations have become tense with foreign minister, Gibran Bassil, another presidential hopeful who heads the Free Patriotic Movement founded by President Michel Aoun. According to Lebanon's power-sharing system, Lebanon's president must be a Christian Maronite.\n\nFrangieh is a close friend of Syrian President Bashar Assad and is allied with the militant Hezbollah group while Geagea is with the Western and Saudi-backed coalition and is a harsh critic of both Assad and Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.\n\nIn 1978, members of the main Christian militia killed Frangieh's father, Tony, as well as his mother and sister and 30 Marada fighters and supporters.\n\nGeagea led the raid in the mountain resort of Ehden but was seriously wounded and withdrew from the operation.\n\nLast week, Frangieh met with the families of those killed four decades ago and asked if he can go ahead with the reconciliation and received their support.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Geagea told reporters: \"Today is a beautiful day.

Didier Badjeck said Wednesday. Fighting was intense in the Mayo Binka area near Nkambe, he said. While no soldiers have been killed, he said the death toll for armed separatists may increase, as fighters escape into the bush.\n\nIn a separate incident, the mayor of Nwa, a local council in the same region, was found dead Wednesday and he is believed to have been killed by separatists, said Emmanuel Bunyui, the mayor of the nearby town of Ndu. Many mayors in English-speaking regions have been targeted by armed separatists demanding an independent English-speaking state, which they call Ambazonia.\n\n\"When we hoist the Cameroon flag in the council premises, we are targeted by the armed men who insist that we should instead display their blue and white flag,\" Bunyui said.\n\nThese incidents have highlighted the separatist unrest in Cameroon, which began in 2016, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest staged demonstrations calling for reforms, criticizing what they called the marginalization of the Anglophone population, which accounts for about one-fifth of the country's 25 million people.\n\nViolence increased after factions of separatists armed themselves following a government clampdown on protests in 2017. Armed separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions and hundreds of civilians have been killed and dozens of schools have been burned and teachers threatened.\n\nIn the past year, more than 1,200 people including separatists, police, military and gendarmes have been killed in the fighting, according to military spokesman Badjeck.\n\nRecently 79 students and three staff were kidnapped from a school by suspected separatists, and they have all now been released.\n\nMore than 100 civilians have escaped the violence and fled to the capital, Yaounde.\n\n\"I am just going to nowhere. I am afraid,\" said Kenneth Kongyu, 19, who joined 75 other people who walked 60 kilometers (37 miles) for two days to escape violence in Ndu, Bunyui's town. \"When they come to the market, they shoot from every angle.\"\n\nTatah Oscar, 17, said he is a former fighter. He said many young Cameroonians are joining the separatists because their families have been killed by military \"so they don't have somebody to count on again ... I am pleading on the government to try and solve the problem so that we the youths we can go back to school.\"\n\nCol. Badjeck, however, said \"Most of the time the terrorists operate and hide among civilians and the world has an impression that civilians are being killed, but our military is professional.\"\n\nIn November last year, Cameroonian President Paul Biya declared the crisis a war. Biya was re-elected to his seventh term in October, although few votes were cast in war-torn Anglophone regions.\n\nPoliticians have repeatedly called on Biya to initiate dialogue to stem the violence. The 85-year-old president, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982, has repeatedly stated that Cameroon is one and indivisible and that he is not ready to negotiate.\n\nThe conflict poses a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally in combating extremism and a new member of the U.N.

The United Nations have condemned both the Cameroon military and separatists for using unnecessary and excessive force and Amnesty International criticized the \"horrific escalation of violence\" in English-speaking regions.\n\nNearly a quarter-million more people have fled the ongoing violence, many leaving their homes on foot with their belongings teetering on their heads.", "You May Be Interested In...", "Jewelry that once belonged to the doomed French Queen Marie Antoinette is set to go on auction in Switzerland Wednesday, where it is expected to sell for millions of dollars.\n\nThe daughter of Holy Roman Empress Maria Teresa and wife of King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, was guillotined in October 1793 during the height of the French Revolution.

It was the first time that a candidate for prime minister has ever been rejected by the 349-seat Riksdagen.\n\nNorlen said he would continue talks with party leaders on Thursday, without giving details.\n\nThe September election produced a hung parliament with the left-leaning side and the center-right bloc securing about 40 percent of the vote each, leaving neither with a majority and paving the way for months of uncertainty and complex coalition talks.\n\nBoth blocs have refused to cooperate with the Sweden Democrats, who made great strides in the election.\n\nAnnie Loof, the leader of the Center Party that voted against Kristersson, said he had broken up the 14-year-old center-right alliance by suggesting a two-party government, leaving out her party and the Liberals.\n\nKristersson said that that although the alliance has suffered \"its worst crisis,\" it is not dead.\n\n\"We have a common platform, but we cannot agree when it comes to taking power.\"\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, who heads Sweden's largest party \u2014 the Social Democrats \u2014 said he was willing to discuss with Loof should she be tapped to try to form a coalition.\n\nLoof earlier said that she doesn't want to be prime minister herself but is willing to try form a government.\n\nPundits say either Loof or Lofven would be next in line to try to form a government.\n\nThe emergence of Sweden Democrats \u2014 with roots in a neo-Nazi movement \u2014 reflects how deeply that Sweden is being transformed by migration.\n\nIn 2015, Sweden took in a record 163,000 migrants \u2014 the highest per capita of any European country.

We don\u2019t have the possibility of leaving the country to see a game of my Chiefs.\u201d\n\nThose who planned on staying in Mexico City, like Dirk Seager, were stuck with a large nonrefundable hotel bill. Seager told the Star that switching his flight would have cost him an additional $350 on top of the $1,400 he paid for the trip. He said he would be watching the game from a bar in Mexico City.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really annoying. The NFL, Chiefs and Rams promised us something, and we made the decision to go.

Charles turns 70 on Nov. 14. Bullen is also the co-founder and executive editor of TrueRoyalty.tv, a subscription video on demand service dedicated to chronicling the royals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks about it a lot,\u201d said Bullen. \u201cHe is a man who very much lives in the present. And all of the programs we\u2019ve made with him, he\u2019s very now. He has a job to do as the Prince of Wales, which he does willingly\u2026 If you speak to him, sure, he\u2019s aware he will be king one day, but that will come at its time. So not too much can be done now if you really think about it.\n\n\u201cAnd also, there\u2019s the fact that for him to become king, then very sadly his mother has to die. So I guess it\u2019s not something anyone wants to focus on, least of all her son\u2026 [And] when you speak with the family, you don\u2019t necessarily get the sense that he\u2019s thinking about the top job. He\u2019s thinking about how he can be the most effective Prince of Wales today\u2026 He just wants to do the job really, really well. When he becomes king, he\u2019ll do that job really, really well.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to Charles\u2019 popularity with the public, he has come a long way. While he was celebrated as one of the most sought-after eligible bachelors in the \u201870s, he was later depicted as heartless by the press during his tumultuous marriage to Princess Diana.\n\nIn 1981, nearly one billion television viewers in 74 countries witnessed the marriage of the British heir to the then-schoolteacher. But after welcoming two sons and then enduring four years of separation, the couple formally divorced in 1996. A year later, Diana died at age 36 from injuries she sustained in a car crash.\n\n\u201cI think the popularity somewhat waned [for Charles] when he married Diana because she, in many ways, became the star of the show,\u201d said Bullen. \u201cAnd he allowed her to be the star of the show. But as their marriage fell apart, and marriages do fall apart, the press needed a villain. And I think there were two villains here. One was [his ex-girlfriend] Camilla Parker Bowles and the other was the Prince of Wales.\n\n\u201c\u2026 People looked at the stories of how could this man leave this absolutely beautiful supermodel-type woman who\u2019s adored around the world for another woman, regardless of who that other woman was. So he became the villain of the piece during the Diana years. When she tragically died, again people wanted to put blame somewhere\u2026 and I think he had to live through all of that. He kept this quiet, calm approach\u2026 And during the last 10-12 years, there has been this rehabilitation\u2026 I think people now are beginning to see who he really is.\u201d\n\nCharles and Bowles married in 2005. Bullen said Charles is at peace with his marriage and completely devoted to his longtime love, 71.\n\n\u201cEveryone that we spoke to has said she\u2019s incredibly good at making him laugh,\u201d explained Bullen. \u201cShe also knows how to get him out of a bad mood. She\u2019s known him for such a long time. She\u2019s known him since the late \u201860s. It\u2019s a genuine love story. He\u2019s incredibly happy. He always refers to her as \u2018my darling wife.\u2019 She\u2019s always there for him.\u201d\n\nBullen pointed out that throughout Charles\u2019 life, he always relied on the support of a strong, loving woman.\n\n\u201cIn the early days it was the queen mother,\u201d he said. \u201cHis grandmother raised him in the early years as the queen was busy being queen. She was very good at telling him how clever he was, how funny he was, how much people like him. The queen mother really built his confidence in him.\n\n\"And from what I know, Camilla does the same for him now\u2026 When the queen mother died, the prince really needed that presence. And Camilla, in many ways, stepped into the shoes of the queen mother and became that strong presence and rock in his life. She\u2019s given him the ability to be himself.\u201d\n\nAnd Charles has also welcomed another leading female figure into his circle. His youngest son Harry, 34, married American actress Meghan Markle in May of this year. When the 37-year-old\u2019s father couldn\u2019t walk her down the aisle, Charles immediately stepped in and took his place.\n\nHarry and Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, is expecting her first child. Bullen said Charles his grateful his has someone like the former \u201cSuits\u201d star by his side. Charles is also aware Markle has a crucial new role to play for the family.\n\n\u201cFrom what I know, he is a big fan of Meghan Markle,\u201d said Bullen. \u201c\u2026 He just wants his boys to be happy. He knows those boys have had a rough life with his marriage falling apart in front of the whole world. Then they lost their mother at a very young age\u2026 And Meghan is making Harry very happy. And that makes the Prince of Wales happy.\n\n\"He wants what every father would want for their son\u2026 And he can also see she\u2019s good for the family. She\u2019s great-looking, she\u2019s really clever, she loves Prince Harry, she\u2019s brilliant on stage \u2014 she\u2019s a great asset to the family.

The list is stacked with liberal star power from the hills of Hollywood to the halls of Washington \u2013 as well as some of their activist friends in and out of the media on both coasts.\n\nWhen asked why they planned to vote in the midterm elections, virtually all of the women on the Marie Claire list, standing atop their soapboxes, gave us the canned version of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s talking points with their own personal flavor mixed in.\n\nRemember Chicken Little, who thought the sky was falling? Listen to these women and you\u2019d think the whole world is collapsing \u2013 and it\u2019s all Donald Trump\u2019s fault, aided by evil Republicans in Congress.\n\nMarie Claire\u2019s writers and editors are so entrenched in their little left-wing corner of the world that they likely don\u2019t even realize their view of women is wildly distorted \u2013 like what you see looking in a fun house mirror. Yet these distortions are obvious to any objective observer.\n\nMarie Claire\u2019s sister publication, Vogue, also swallows the true-blue Democratic line. That magazine published a piece on its website Thursday headlined:\" Why Do White Women Keep Voting for the GOP and Against Their Own Interests?\u201d\n\nThe headline illustrates the arrogance, ignorance and condescension of Vogue journalists.

And, believe it or not, we don\u2019t all think alike and have the same goals, interests and political beliefs. And we can use our brains to think for ourselves, without waiting for left-wing writers to tell us what politicians to support and what to believe.\n\nSince the Marie Claire journalists are incapable of recognizing that conservative and pro-Trump women can be influential, as a public service I\u2019ve put together a list of such women who should have been on the Marie Claire list.\n\nIt is glaringly obvious that at least some of these women belong on the magazine\u2019s list. One has to wonder how Marie Claire\u2019s list ever got published without them \u2013 except we know. The magazine\u2019s list wasn\u2019t really a list of influencers as much as it was a liberal agenda and a left-wing wish list.\n\nHere are my additions to the Marie Claire list of influential women:\n\nNikki Haley: As U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Haley set herself apart as one of the most effective leaders in the Trump administration, proving she\u2019s not afraid to make the tough calls and refusing to let the U.S. be bullied by other countries. As governor of South Carolina she was praised for bridging the racial divide in the aftermath of the mass shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston; where nine black church members were killed by a self-proclaimed white supremacist.\n\nKellyanne Conway: If the topic is influential women and politics, no one should leave out Conway, who blew through the glass ceiling by becoming the first woman to successfully run a winning presidential campaign. Unless you accidentally on purpose leave her off the list. Two years after President Trump\u2019s election, Conway still remains one of his most trusted advisers. She\u2019s smart and savvy \u2013 and in a debate you want her on your side.\n\nIvanka Trump: The president\u2019s eldest daughter has held the title of businesswoman, author, entrepreneur and trusted adviser to her father in the White House. Prior to the 2016 election, she was the executive vice president of development and acquisitions at the Trump Organization, co-founder of Trump Hotels, founded her own clothing line. She is also the author of the books \"Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success\u201d and \u201cThe Trump Card: Playing to Win in Work and Life.\u201d To say she wields influence is an understatement.\n\nSarah Sanders: The White House press secretary is a trusted adviser to the president and political punching bag for the left. She takes on a hostile media intent on undermining her boss and his administration every day. No matter how many \u201cgotcha\u201d questions they throw at her disguised as journalism, she reminds them who runs the briefing room.\n\nKay Coles James: As the president of the Heritage Foundation, James leads an organization that has provided key people in leadership roles on the Trump transition team in the Trump administration. The foundation has produced scholarship, research and ideas that influence both the administration and Republican members of Congress.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst: The Republican senator is the first woman from Iowa elected to Congress, as well as the first woman combat veteran elected to the Senate. Does anyone else hear the glass breaking above their head? In the Senate she\u2019s fought to improve mental health care for veterans.\n\nMaria Bartiromo: As the host of Fox Business News programs \u201cMornings with Maria\u201d and \u201cMaria Bartiromo's Wall Street\u201d \u2013 as well as \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d on Fox News Channel \u2013 Bartiromo is a straight shooter who is tough and fair, and an outstanding journalist. She\u2019s landed interviews with President Trump, former President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush.\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn: The Tennessee Republican member of the U.S. House was elected Tuesday to the Senate. Remember when the dirty little secret was uncovered on Capitol Hill that your taxpayer money was being used as part of a hush fund to silence sexual assault accusers? Blackburn not only co-sponsored legislation to disclose settlements, but she was one of only a few women who was outspoken in trying to combat the Washington power machine to be transparent. Meanwhile, all of the heralded liberal women senators on Marie Claire\u2019s list have been silent about exposing their predator colleagues. All of them. Hypocrisy, anyone?\n\nPenny Young Nance: Most people don\u2019t know it, but the largest organization centered on women and public policy is not Planned Parenthood, the National Abortion Rights Action League, or some other left-wing feminist group. It\u2019s Concerned Women for America. Nance is the president of the 500,000-member group. CWA will celebrate its 40th anniversary next year \u2013 staying power that transcends most liberal groups.\n\nCandace Owens: As the communications director for Turning Point USA, Owens struck a chord with Americans over the last year with her message of ditching the victim mentality. Whether she\u2019s traveling the media circuit or speaking at college campuses, Owens is encouraging everyone to think for themselves and make decisions based on their experiences.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (honorable mention): While Collins is far from a conservative, the integrity the moderate Republican senator displayed in voting her conscience to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in the face of severe backlash earns her an honorary spot on this list. Her actions are in stark contrast to the reprehensible behavior from her colleagues on the left who made Marie Claire\u2019s list, including Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen.

However, if you want to see some shattered glass fall from the ceiling, you can\u2019t ignore at least some of the women who should have made the list.", "An op-ed published this week in the Wall Street Journal has ignited rumors of a potential 2020 presidential run for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe piece discusses the different iterations of Hillary Clinton the public has seen over the past 30-plus years. But none of those versions became president and no matter how many times Clinton tries to reinvent herself she cannot change who she is at the core: inauthentic, unlikable and out of touch.\n\nAccording to the op-ed by Mark Penn and Andrew Stein \u2013 headlined \u201cHillary Will Run Again\u201d \u2013 Hillary Clinton 1.0 was a \u201cuniversal-health-care-promoting progressive firebrand\u201d in 1994 when she was first lady.\n\nHillary Clinton version 2.0 was a moderate when she successfully ran for the Senate and again when she lost in the Democratic presidential primaries to then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008.\n\nIn 2016, Clinton 3.0 was a progressive who moved further to the left because of her challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. And Hillary Clinton version 4.0 will run for president in 2020 by returning to her roots as a progressive, Penn and Stein predict.\n\nBut the fact there have been so many different versions of Clinton is precisely the problem.\n\nClinton is inauthentic. Former Obama adviser and Democratic strategist David Axelrod nailed this point about Clinton and the 2016 election when he said: \u201cAuthenticity is a big factor and a leading indicator for candidates, and they have to be comfortable in their own skin. There is no one wishing that Donald Trump would speak his mind. Hillary Clinton has always been allergic to revealing herself, and when she does talk, it comes out through a political filter.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s authenticity has also taken a major hit over the years because she changes policy positions depending on where the political winds are blowing. This gives the perception that she is not rooted in any core beliefs.\n\nOne issue that probably hurt Clinton most in the rust belt was trade. As secretary of state in 2012, she backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, even calling it the \u201cgold standard.\u201d However, she changed her position in 2016 while under scrutiny from Bernie Sanders on the left and candidate Trump on the right.\n\nClinton also has a likability problem. In an interview with the Washington Post, Democratic pollster Peter Hart put it this way: \u201cI bring it down to one thing and one thing only, and that is likability.\u201d\n\nThe likability issue was also brought up during a 2008 Democratic primary debate in New Hampshire, when the moderator said voters were impressed by Clinton\u2019s resume but were \u201chesitating on the likability issue.\u201d Obama famously quipped that she was \u201clikable enough\u201d during the exchange.\n\nClinton is also out of touch. Her surprise pit stop to an Ohio Chipotle in 2015 while on the campaign trail demonstrated this. Despite it being a great opportunity for pictures with customers, she wore dark sunglasses in the restaurant. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to speak with anyone.\n\nClinton\u2019s infamous \u201cbasketful of Deplorables\u201d comment also underscores this point. In response to her comment calling his supporters \"racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic,\u201d Trump responded that Clinton showed \"her true contempt for everyday Americans.\"\n\nOther gaffes also speak to Clinton\u2019s disconnect with voters. In response to a question from ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer in 2014 about her $200,000 speaking fees, Clinton said that she and President Bill Clinton \u201ccame out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt.\u201d\n\nPresident Clinton received a $15 million advance for his memoir after leaving the White House and then-Sen. and former first lady Hillary Clinton received $8 million in a deal for her memoir.\n\nIn what will likely be a crowded 2020 Democrat primary field, Hillary Clinton would not stand out. Her time has come and gone. She is a relic of the past. No amount of pollsters, speechwriters, or consultants can change who she is \u2013 and that is why she will never be president.", "A 23-year-old dancer for the St. Louis Ballet was reported missing Tuesday, a day after authorities found her car abandoned in Mark Twain Lake State Park.\n\nThe vehicle belonging to Raffaella Maria Stroik was discovered Monday by a Missouri state park ranger in the park's boat ramp parking lot, but no missing persons report had yet been filed for the owner, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nAfter authorities found the car in the same spot the following day, they investigated and found that a missing person report had been filed, the newspaper reported.\n\n\"Her keys were found laying outside the vehicle,\" Sgt.

The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. \"Let me sleep,\" Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.\n\nOne word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn't returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.\n\nThey were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.\n\nThey knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.\n\nThey knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.\n\nAnd they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far \u2014 just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.\n\nNo one had, and his parents' worry grew to panic.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting\n\n___\n\nAll around al-Said district, in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.\n\nThat wasn't unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.\n\nFrom above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.\n\nAbdullah's village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nAl-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.\n\nFor more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years \u2014 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people \u2014 militants and civilians \u2014 were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.\n\nAt least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah's disappearance, a drone's missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.\n\nBut here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.\n\n___\n\nSoon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.\n\nAbdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn't want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.\n\nThe boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.\n\nThey caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.\n\nAbdullah loved Ataq \u2014 the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.\n\nIt was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.\n\n___\n\nAbdullah's parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.\n\nWhat if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.\n\nAbdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah's brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.\n\n\"If you saw him, you'd think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,\" Mohsanaa said.\n\nWhen Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn't let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months \"he became a normal baby,\" she said.\n\nIn an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah's father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.\n\nSaleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen's biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn't reach the pedals yet.\n\nHe always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.\n\n\"You just study, and I will take care of everything else,\" Saleh told him. \"I don't want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn't finish school.\"\n\nNow his boy had vanished.\n\nSaleh's eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week's leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they'd seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?\n\nFinally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He'd seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.\n\nSaleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.\n\nAs night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh's brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city's edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.\n\nMohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn't want them driving around in the dark.\n\n\"Things happen at night,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nOn the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn't told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn't have the nerve to say anything.\n\nThey passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters' camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: \"I am with al-Qaida. I'll come back tomorrow. Don't come for me.\"\n\nThe boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.\n\n___\n\nWhen he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah's father tried calling back to the militant's phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else \"I won't be able to get him back.\" Once in al-Qaida's hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt \u2014 or he might be hit by a drone.\n\nWith al-Qaida, \"all roads lead to death,\" said one of Saleh's nephews.\n\nDespite his wife's warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh's nephews who offered to help.\n\nThe search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.\n\nSaleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn't have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.\n\nThe al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn't there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.\n\nMubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.\n\nMubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.\n\nAs the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh's taxi.\n\n___\n\nAt around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base \u2014 perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia \u2014 launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.\n\nThe hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father's taxi.\n\nThe missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah's father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.\n\nThere were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.\n\n\"It was shocking. I wept,\" Abdullah said. \"I realized he had come looking for me.\"\n\n____\n\nNews of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.\n\nOne of Mubarak's brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.\n\n\"He is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,\" he said of Mubarak. \"He was doing something good and got killed.\"\n\nIn Ataq, one of Saleh's nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. \"Your brothers and uncle are in God's embrace,\" a neighbor said.\n\nThe remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah's odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh's legs were gone; Zayad's body was cut in half.\n\nIn keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.\n\nAbdullah's mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.\n\n\"It's not possible. We talked in the evening,\" Mohsanaa said. \"I told them not to go out at night.\"\n\nShe was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.\n\nThen Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.\n\nTribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.\n\n\"It was my all mistake,\" Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.\n\n\"I was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.\"\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.\n\nEver since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could \u2014 police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals \u2014 certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.\n\nThey even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.\n\nTheir voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed \u2014 a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded \u2014 but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh's family to submit evidence that they were civilians.\n\nAbdullah's family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men. They keep the shrapnel printed with serial numbers wrapped in a blanket hoping one day to present it as evidence in an investigation.\n\nMohsanaa doesn't believe she'll ever see justice for the killing. With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family's grief. She doesn't speak of the killing in front of Abdullah. A pious woman, she knows he mustn't blame himself.\n\n\"This is God's verdict. If it wasn't written, they wouldn't have gone,\" Mohsanaa said. \"What's the child's guilt? He is a victim. He's a poor boy.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lee Keath in Cairo contributed.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe United States has waged a drone war in Yemen for 16 years, trying to suppress al-Qaida's branch here. But the campaign has had a hidden cost: civilians cut down by the drones' missiles.\n\nThere is no comprehensive count of civilian deaths because of the difficulty of confirming identities and allegiances of those killed. But in an examination of drone strikes this year alone, The Associated Press found that at least 30 of the dead likely did not belong to al-Qaida.\n\nThat is around a third of all those killed in drone strikes so far in 2018. The Pentagon does not release its assessment of the death toll, but an independent database considered one of the most credible in tracking violence in Yemen counted 88 people \u2014 militants and non-militants \u2014 killed by drones this year.\n\nThe AP count gives a glimpse, even if incomplete, into how often civilians are mistakenly hit by drone strikes, at a time when the Trump administration has dramatically ramped up the use of armed drones. It has carried out 176 strikes during its nearly two years in office, compared to the 154 strikes during the entire eight years of the Obama administration, according to a count by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.\n\nThe AP based its count on interviews with witnesses, families, tribal leaders and activists. Most of those killed, 24, were civilians; at least 6 others were fighters in pro-government forces \u2014 meaning ostensibly on the same side as the U.S. \u2014 who were hit in strikes away from the front lines while engaged in civilian life.\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting\n\n___\n\nThe drone toll goes almost unnoticed in the region's conflicts. Immensely greater destruction has been wreaked by U.S. allies in the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign against Iranian-backed Shiite rebels known as Houthis. More than 57,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen's civil war, by some estimates, and thousands more may have died of starvation caused by the conflict.\n\nYet the killing of a single man \u2014 Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, slain by Saudi operatives in his own country's consulate \u2014 has raised more international uproar than any of those deaths in a war waged by a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and baked by the U.S.\n\nIn comparison, the toll from U.S drones in Yemen runs in the hundreds, including both militants and civilians. Several databases are trying to track the deaths, with varying results. The Bureau for Investigative Journalism counted up to 1,020 killed by strikes from 2009 to 2016, under President Barack Obama, compared to up to 205 killed in 2017 and 2018. Another database, by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, counted 331 killed the past two years.\n\nCounting civilians among those numbers is complicated by the difficulty in determining who belongs to al-Qaida in a country of multiple warring militias. Al-Qaida has joined the battle against the Houthis, and many of its fighters are incorporated into militias armed and funded by the U.S.-backed coalition.\n\nThe campaign has scored some military successes. In 2015, U.S. strikes took out Nasser al-Wahishi, the top leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the Yemeni branch is known, and several senior lieutenants.\n\nBut drones have been most effective in forcing al-Qaida to limit its movements and hide in the mountains, avoid large gatherings and restrict cellphone use. The group withdrew from areas it controlled in the south but was allowed to keep weapons and money under secret deals it struck with the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member.\n\nOver the years, the cost of the pursuit of senior leadership has been high.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has killed at least 66 civilians, 31 of them children, in the unsuccessful hunt for one man, Qassim al-Rimi, one of AQAP's founders who in 2015 succeeded al-Wahishi as the group's chief.\n\nThose deaths came in two raids reportedly targeting al-Rimi. The first was in 2009 in the southern village of al-Majalah. The second came on Jan 27, 2017, only days after Trump's inauguration, in a U.S. special forces assault on a village in Bayda province.\n\nThe civilian deaths come in a war conducted from a vast distance.\n\nDrone pilots work remotely at American bases, most often in the U.S., sometimes on 11- to 14-hour shifts housed in rooms like shipping containers lined with electronics. They operate based on intelligence from informants but they also carry out so-called \"signature strikes,\" based on observing suspicious patterns of behavior. They have a list of characteristics, and if a subject on the ground shows a number of them, he could be targeted, a former participant to the drone program told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the operations.\n\nMistakes happen from bad intel or misjudging behavior, he said. Rights groups have expressed concern that some of the intelligence may come from prisoners held in jails run by Emirati-backed militias where torture is widespread.\n\nSome of the strikes from 2018 that the AP examined appeared to be mistakes.\n\nOn Jan. 1, a drone missile slammed into a farm in Bayda province where 70-year-old Mohammed Mansar Abu Sarima sat with a younger relative, killing both, according to a relative, Mohammed Abu Sarima.\n\nThe slain men had just returned from mediating a local dispute. In a country where tribal links are powerful and the justice system nearly non-existent, such mediations are common to resolve conflicts over land or deaths. They involve large gatherings of tribesmen who are often armed, potentially raising drone operators' suspicions.\n\n\"We don't have any affiliation. They are simple farmers who don't know how to read or write,\" said the brother. \"We live in fear. Drones don't leave the sky.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, a 14-year-old shepherd, Yahia al-Hassbi, was struck by a drone as he tended goats several kilometers (miles) from a checkpoint that al-Qaida had tried recently to seize. He was killed along with a construction worker passing by at the time, according to relatives and three local human rights workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nFurther east, in Hadramawt province, drones carried out several consecutive days of strikes in March, targeting vehicles on a main highway. Some of the strikes killed al-Qaida militants, according to rights activists in the area.\n\nBut others struck down cars carrying people who had fled to the area from a nearby province, Jawf, to escape fighting. A drone's missile on March 5 killed a 10-year-old boy, Ammer al-Mahshami, and wounded the driver, according to three relatives. Four days later, another car was hit, killing six men and boys, including a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, travelling to a funeral.\n\nSaleh al-Wahir, the brother of one of the dead, was in a car behind them. \"I saw it before my eyes,\" he said of the blast. \"Bodies were ripped apart.\" A report from the Jawf Human Rights office concluded the men were civilians.\n\nSurvivors are rare. Adel al-Mandhari recounted how his car was thrown through the air by the blast of a drone's missile. He lost his legs and an arm and was burned all over his body. The four others in the car \u2014 his brother, uncle, cousin and another relative \u2014 were all killed. None were connected to al-Qaida, said al-Mandhari, a civil servant. Two other relatives and the three rights workers in Bayda confirmed his account.\n\nSince the attack, al-Mandhari has spoken to the media and rights groups, seeking ways to get compensation and an apology from the U.S. \"I lost hope,\" he said. \"Nothing is going to happen.\"\n\nEven some strikes that the AP did not include in its count may have killed civilians, though there is some dispute over them.\n\nOn May 14, two men, Hussein al-Dayani and Abdullah al-Karbi, were killed when a drone struck their pickup truck in an area of Shabwa province where al-Qaida is known to have a presence.\n\nAl-Dayani's brother, Khaled, denied they were militants. He said his brother was a fighter in a militia battling the Houthis. \"We are against those people,\" Khaled said of al-Qaida.\n\nTwo weeks later, a 17-year-old, Mahdar Hussein al-Hag, died in a strike while driving his motorcycle in the same area. Mahdar's father said he was a high school student and was returning from buying vegetables. \"He might have been mistaken for al-Qaida youth who are active in this area.\"\n\nA Yemeni security official said the dead in those strikes were all al-Qaida members, though he did not provide evidence.

The blaze has left an array of hazards, including trees ready to fall, downed power lines, toxins, water main and gas leaks.\n\nA forecast of possible rain next week would help firefighters but also raised the prospect of potential mud flows, Osby said.\n\nAnother fire that also broke out last Thursday in Ventura County was 92 percent contained after burning nearly 7 square miles (18 square kilometers).

The suit blasted the state's \"provisional ballot scheme,\" that could disenfranchise a registered voter at the ballot box.\n\nJudge Amy Totenberg, who was appointed by President Obama, also ruled that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5 p.m., which falls before the Nov. 20 deadline set by state law.\n\nAbrams is hoping to become the first African-American woman governor of a U.S. state.\n\nIf Kemp is able to hold onto his narrow lead to avoid a runoff election, his governorship will be marred by lingering questions about his handling of a contentious election he oversaw as secretary of state.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Regional security and the strengthening of ties with Japan and the U.S. will be high on the agenda for Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison when he meets leaders from both countries amid continuing concerns about the growing influence of China in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nMorrison will meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday, when Abe makes a flying visit to Darwin between a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore and the weekend's meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in Papua New Guinea.

The Australian prime minister's office declined to release a figure, calling the assistance an \"extension of long-term cooperation.\"\n\n\"The security is going to be so tight,\" said Jonathan Pryke, a Papua New Guinea expert at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. \"This is going to be the safest time to be in Port Moresby.\"\n\nEven so, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and his entourage will be flying into the country each day from northern Queensland in Australia.\n\nOutside of the spruced-up capital, 2018 has been a year of renewed tribal and political violence.\n\nEarlier this month, rioting engulfed the coastal town of Alotau more than 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Port Moresby after police leaving for APEC killed a woman and her child in a road accident, said the town's Catholic Bishop Rolando Santos. Gunfights erupted when police reinforcements arrived from the capital, he said. The growth of a Chinese diaspora, said Pryke, has also fueled economic tensions that have led to protests and riots.\n\n\"There isn't much funds for education, health,\" said Santos, a Filipino who's lived in Papua New Guinea for 17 years. \"Many were affected because of APEC.\"\n\nThe country's Catholic Bishops Conference has criticized dire shortages of basic services while the government poured resources into getting the capital ready for world leaders.\n\n\"We share the concern of many about the huge amount of our limited resources being expended on this event which seems designed to entertain and impress the rich and powerful,\" said its president Rochus Tatamai.\n\nPapua New Guineans, he said, are \"suffering and dying in order to make APEC a success.\"", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nHeavy rainfall was affecting some voting in Fiji's general election Wednesday, as two men who led different military coups battled for control of the island nation.\n\nThe bad weather prompted the Elections Office to close 17 polling venues, affecting some 6,000 voters, according to the Fiji Times. Those people would get a chance to vote at a later date, the Times reported.\n\nOpinion polls indicate Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama is poised to win a second term after he first held democratic elections in 2014, eight years after seizing power in a coup. His main opponent is Sitiveni Rabuka, who led two military coups in the 1980s before serving seven years as prime minister. Just this week, a judge cleared Rabuka of an electoral disclosure violation in a case many viewed as being politically motivated.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to take a toll on its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation's pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people. Given the history of coups, political stability has been a big issue leading up to the election, as have racial tensions and economic issues.\n\n\"Bainimarama does look set to secure his second victory at the polls and has already led the country for 13 years through a period of relative stability,\" said Jonathan Pryke, the director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they've made under Bainimarama.\n\n\"There are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\" said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \"Bainimarama's government is not bad. He's OK.\"\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There are rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\"We're bound to have another coup if he doesn't win,\" said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, called \"iTaukei,\" and away from Fijians of Indian descent, or Indo-Fijians.\n\niTaukei make up about 57 percent of the country's population, while Indo-Fijians make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from Parliament.\n\n\"Bainimarama's key success has been to establish the name 'Fijian' for all citizens of Fiji,\" said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \"His legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believe Rabuka will help restore their prestige, and favor his promise to bring back the nation's Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power, he has refashioned his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader. His appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji's externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji's relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama's government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones. But widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama's opponents have vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\nAs well as Bainimarama's FijiFirst party and Rabuka's Social Democratic Liberal Party (Sodelpa), the National Federation Party (NFP) is also expected to be an election contender. In 2014, FijiFirst won 59 percent of votes, Sodelpa won 28 percent, and NFP won 5.5 percent.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.", "", "", "More than 30 people who experienced or knew of Nikolas Cruz's worrying behavior didn't report it until 17 people were killed in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, earlier this year.\n\nCruz's behavior was \"troubling ... and in many cases it probably should have caused them to report what they heard, saw or learned,\" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said Tuesday, according to The Sun-Sentinel. \"But for a variety of reasons they did not.\"\n\nPARKLAND SCHOOL SHOOTER REGISTERED TO VOTE WHILE IN JAIL, OUTRAGING VICTIM'S FATHER\n\nGualtieri, who also chairs the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission \u2014 which was created after the massacre at the school \u2014 disclosed the news Tuesday as the commission opened four days of hearings.\n\nCruz, the suspected shooter, reportedly engaged in questionable behavior long before the mass shooting in February -- including killing animals. According to a sheriff's office detective, Cruz once showed another student a photo of a decapitated cat.\n\nThe 20-year-old also allegedly \"said he was glad they killed all those gay people\" in reference to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, which left 49 people dead.\n\nCruz also reportedly \"made bad jokes about Jewish people, Nazis and Hitler and wished all Jews were dead\" and said \"he did not like black people and would like to shoot them.\"\n\nDays after the massacre, the FBI admitted to receiving a call about Cruz in early January. The person called their Public Access Line (PAL) tipline to express concerns about his erratic behavior and social media posts.\n\nThe FBI said in a statement at the time that \"under established protocols, the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life\" and that protocols were not followed after they received the tip.\n\nPARKLAND SCHOOL SHOOTING SUSPECT'S BIRTH MOTHER'S CRIMINAL HISTORY COULD DECIDE IF HE LIVES OR DIES\n\nThe parents of Jaime Guttenberg, a student who was killed in the massacre, filed a lawsuit against the FBI on Tuesday because the tip wasn't acted upon.\n\n\u201cEverybody failed, and this is going to be the shooting where we hold people accountable,\u201d Guttenberg's father, Fred, said at the hearing on Tuesday, The Miami Herald reported. \u201cIf only one person had stepped up and done their job, my daughter would be alive today.\"\n\nThe Broward County sheriff said after the shooting said at least \"20 calls for service\" were made regarding Cruz in the last few years alone.\n\nGualtieri reiterated on Tuesday that if you \"see something, say something.\"\n\n\"It means something, and it has to be more than a phrase,\u201d Gualtieri said. \u201cWe need it to resonate with the public because law enforcement simply cannot be everywhere at the same time, and we have to have the public\u2019s help to effectively do our job.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff's detective said that while two students did report Cruz to school administrators in December 2016, they were ignored.", "Miranda Lambert is opening up about her and Jason Aldean's summer hit \"Drowns the Whiskey.\"\n\nThe song, which was released in May and reached No. 1 status three months later, was the country singer's first tune to reach the same accomplishment in four years, according to The Washington Post.\n\nLambert's last No. 1 hit was her single \"Automatic\" off of her \"Platinum\" album in June 2014.\n\n\u201cYes, I had to sing with someone with a penis to get a number one,\u201d Lambert, 35, told the outlet in a new interview published on Tuesday about the radio chart disparity.\n\n\"I do like this person, Jason Aldean, a lot . . . so it was a great song with an old friend,\" she continued, explaining that \"it is interesting that I haven\u2019t had even a Top 20 in a long, long time.

Republicans claimed control of the House for the first time in 40 years, capturing a staggering 54 seats. It was the biggest gain of seats for either party since 1948.\n\nAnd everyone thought the outcome spelled doom for President Bill Clinton.\n\nFour years later, House Republicans went on to impeach the president after his affair with Monica Lewinsky. But Democrats losing the House in the 1994 midterms proved to be one of the best things which ever happened to President Clinton. Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., was politically virulent \u2013 as were many of the House GOP\u2019s policies.\n\nPresident Clinton needed a foil. And he earned one in Gingrich and the upstart House Republicans. Gingrich challenged the President over government spending, sparking three government shutdowns. Gingrich and the strident approach taken by House Republicans polluted the 1996 presidential bid of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. President Clinton easily vanquished Dole and returned for a second term.\n\nIt's possible that losing the House could be the best thing that ever happened to President Trump. His poll numbers are low. He lost badly in the presidential popular vote, failing to hit 50 percent in multiple states. With their new power, Democrats promise exhaustive investigations and inquiries into a host of issues.\n\n\"The business of presidential harassment, which we were deeply engaged in in the late '90s, improved the president\u2019s approval rating and tanked ours,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week. \"My observation is that it might not be a smart strategy. But it's up to them to decide how to handle that.\"\n\nIf anyone ever needed a foil, it's President Trump. No fool he, the president knows how Republicans transfigured prospective House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., into their archenemy more than a decade ago. Democrats must play their cards very carefully, lest they plunge into the historical trap which Mr. Trump could lay for them.\n\nThe President has already warned of a \"war-like posture\" if House Democrats push too far in their inquiries.\n\n\"They can play that game. But we can play it better,\" the president said Wednesday at this post-election press conference Wednesday.\n\nTrump tweeted that his administration would counter Democratic inquests with probes \"for all of the leaks of Classified Information and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!\"\n\nThis is a challenge for Democrats, who partly won control of the House because of what voters interpreted as Republican fealty to the President. Some of the Democrats\u2019 mandate \u2013 to say nothing of their Constitutional responsibility \u2013 is to conduct appropriate investigations and oversight of the executive branch.\n\nBut there is peril in this approach. House Democrats must withstand the urge to make everything about repudiating the administration and the president. This requires balance. And it\u2019s unclear if Democrats can walk that line.\n\nHow do they investigate \u2013 yet not go too far?\n\nPelosi held considerable sway when she served as Speaker from 2007 to 2011, but some wonder if she can harness restive Democrats with the same mastery of old. The Democratic caucus is different from the one she presided over in days of yore. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., surfaced in Pelosi's office Tuesday to take part in a protest about climate change. Never mind that it was Pelosi who muscled the so-called \"cap and trade\" climate bill through the House when she was Speaker in 2009. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s maneuver is emblematic of how Pelosi could encounter pressure from some liberals who don\u2019t think she is willing to go to the mat with President Trump \u2013 and moderates who think the left is going too far.\n\nThis requires finesse.\n\n\"I don't think we'll have any scattershot freelancing,\" said Pelosi last week regarding Democratic inquiries. \"When we go down any of these paths, we'll know what we\u2019re doing and we'll do it right.\"\n\nNaturally, what's too much and what's right falls within the eye of the beholder. Republicans are lying in wait, ready to excoriate Democrats for pushing too far. One can bet that Republicans will portray any Democratic scrutiny of the President as a bridge too far.\n\n\"I know what the Democrats want to do. Just investigations and impeachment,\" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Fox Business Network on Sunday. \"America is too great to be led by such a small vision.\"\n\nPelosi recently sidestepped a question about Democratic endeavors to obtain Trump's tax returns. She's frequently deployed a rhetorical sleight-of-hand, using the word \"oversight\" rather than \"investigations.\"\n\nPresident Trump would love to tangle with the Democrats. Aggressive \"oversight\" by likely House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and probable Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., complete with exchanges with White House officials from the dais may energize the left-wing base. But this is the type of battle where Trump excels. Brass-knuckle street fights are de rigueur for this president. Pelosi is wise to attempt a measured approach once Democrats formally claim the majority in early January.\n\nBut can Democrats keep themselves in check even if they wanted to?\n\nThe president will make it hard.\n\nDemocrats hit the ceiling when Trump sacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions just hours after they won the House. Democrats fired off letters demanding information on the firing, called for Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself on the Russia investigation and demanded action on legislation to inoculate Special Counsel Robert Mueller from interference.\n\nThe Democrats' hunger for investigation and revenge may be too much for them to resist the \u00e0 la carte dishes President Trump serves up on a platter.\n\nStriking the proper balance will likely prove to be Pelosi's biggest challenge if she is to serve as the next Speaker.\n\nSome Democrats say it's time for Pelosi to go and have demanded new leadership at the top of their caucus. Some liberals certainly don't want to hear anything about \"measured responses\" and \"restraint.\" They would rather rip a page out of the House Freedom Caucus playbook and raise Cain.\n\nThat\u2019s why the most compelling case for Pelosi to return as Speaker may be her reputation as someone who has been there before. As Speaker, Pelosi has already tangled with a president of the opposite party. She knows how to take a deliberate approach to investigations and oversight.\n\nPresident Trump will likely explode at even reasonable efforts by House Democrats to probe his administration. The President understands the value of a foil \u2013 in much the same way President Clinton comprehended the significance of Newt Gingrich and GOPers after the 1994 midterms.\n\nThings worked well for Mr. Clinton. If House Democrats aren't careful, they'll stumble into the same trap House Republicans did 24 years ago.", "Bob Woodward, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Watergate journalist whose recent book, \"Fear,\" described chaotic infighting at the White House, on Tuesday criticized CNN for filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration and charged that too many media figures \"have become emotionally unhinged.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Global Financial Leadership Conference in Naples, Florida, Woodward said \"the remedy [isn\u2019t suing the administration]. ... It\u2019s more serious reporting about what he\u2019s doing.\u201d NBC reporter Dylan Byers first flagged Woodward's comments.\n\nCNN filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday demanding that the White House restore the press credential of star reporter Jim Acosta. The administration suspended Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which provided expedited access to the White House grounds, after he broke protocol by refusing to surrender his microphone during a press conference last week.\n\nAcosta continued to pepper Trump with a barrage of declarative statements and questions -- at times talking over Trump -- until the president stepped away from the podium, even though reporters are typically afforded just one follow-up.\n\n\u201cIn the news media there has been an emotional reaction to Trump,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cToo many people for Trump or against Trump have become emotionally unhinged about this.\u201d\n\nWoodward added that CNN was taking Trump's \"bait\" by enlisting high-profile lawyer Ted Olson to pursue a federal case. \"This is a negative,\" Woodward said. \"Trump is sitting around saying, \u2018This is great.'\u201d\n\nThat sentiment was echoed in a piece in Rolling Stone on Tuesday by Ryan Bort titled, \"CNN Has Played Right Into Trump's Hands.\"\n\n\"Too many people for Trump or against Trump have become emotionally unhinged.\" \u2014 Journalist Bob Woodward\n\nJUDGE NAP: CNN HAS A GOOD CASE AGAINST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION\n\n(Trump fiercely criticized Woodward after his book released earlier this year, saying \"he\u2019s had a lot of credibility problems.\")\n\nCNN's suit alleges that the White House violated Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights by punishing him for the content of his speech without providing notice or any due process, although the White House maintains that Acosta was penalized solely because of his behavior.\n\nNone of CNN's approximately 50 other \"hard pass\" holders has lost White House access, nor have reporters belonging to any other liberal-leaning media outlet -- although Trump has suggested that may change.\n\nAt the testy press conference the day after last week's midterm elections, Acosta continued to shout questions at Trump even after he tried to move on to another reporter, and he refused to hand the microphone to an intern who tried to retrieve it.\n\nThe litigation filed by CNN, which does not fully describe Acosta's actions during the press conference and contains several substantive factual inaccuracies, also asserts that the Secret Service violated the Administrative Procedures Act by taking a final agency action in penalizing Acosta without providing any notice or hearing.\n\nThe suit, in arguing that the White House was lying about its motivations for taking action against Acosta, additionally claims that White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders shared a \"doctored\" clip of the episode on Twitter. In the low-resolution .GIF clip shared by Sanders, Acosta's arm moves slightly faster than it does in higher-quality footage of the press conference, appearing to show him more forcefully striking the intern's arm as she tries to take the microphone from him.\n\nHowever, despite reporting from a wide variety of outlets that Sanders had shared a doctored clip, a Buzzfeed analysis suggested the changes in the video could have resulted inadvertently from the conversion of the footage to the lower-fidelity .GIF format, which is commonly used on Twitter. The format produces fewer frames per second than a higher-quality video source, making scenes appear to move faster.\n\nWhite House officials, including Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, have acknowledged that the video was indeed \"sped up\" during the conversion process, while consistently denying that the clip was purposefully doctored.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Sanders used a bogus justification by claiming that Acosta had \"placed his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as White House intern.\"\n\nIn responding to CNN's suit, Sanders on Tuesday said that Acosta's behavior had \"impeded the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d\n\n\"After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions\u2014each of which the President answered\u2014he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions,\" Sanders said in statement.\n\n\"This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters,\" she continued. \"The White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional.

However, poultry may also carry campylobacter, E. coli and other bacteria,\u201d Dena Champion, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told Fox News.\n\nEach year in the United States, roughly 1.2 million people are sickened by the Salmonella bacteria while an estimated 23,000 are hospitalized, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe illness \u2014 which can cause diarrhea, fever, vomiting and abdominal cramps, among other side effects \u2014 is usually caused by eating or drinking foods contaminated with the Salmonella bacteria, according to Healthline. Roughly 1 million cases of Salmonella infections each year are caused by food, according to the CDC.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind that cross-contamination can put your family at risk,\u201d Champion warned.\n\n\u201cWhile thoroughly cooking your turkey is an important way to stay safe from foodborne illness, you may still become ill if the bacteria has made its way to other surfaces like cutting boards, counters, towels, etc.,\u201d she added.\n\nWhat is the temperature a turkey should be cooked to?\n\nA turkey is ready to eat when its internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit, Champion said, adding a thermometer \u201cshould be placed in 3 places: in the innermost part of the thigh, the innermost part of the wing and the thickest part of the breast.\u201d\n\nDespite popular belief, a turkey is not necessarily ready to come out of the oven if its juices are running clear, Ben Chapman, food safety specialist and assistant professor of food science at North Carolina State University, told Live Science.\n\n\u201cColor is not an indicator of safety or doneness,\" he warned.\n\nHow many days after Thanksgiving is it safe to eat properly-cooked meat?\n\nIn short, approximately three to four days.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind your leftovers should be stored properly. That means move leftover turkey to the refrigerator within two hours after eating. Otherwise, your leftovers are not safe to consume,\u201d Champion said, reminding turkey lovers they should freeze anything that isn\u2019t eaten within that time period.\n\n\u201cI encourage people to freeze the amount they will use in one meal for easy thawing later,\u201d she added.\n\nTo prevent the growth of bacteria, the Food Safety and Inspection Service with the U.S. Department of Agriculture says meat should be placed in a fridge no more than two hours after its cooked.\n\nIf someone does get sick, what should they do?\n\nThose sickened by the Salmonella bacteria will typically show symptoms of the infection \u201cabout 6-48 hours after consuming [infected food],\" Champion said.\n\n9 EASY NO-BAKE DESSERTS FOR THANKSGIVING\n\n\u201cAnyone who is concerned that they have contracted any foodborne illness should seek medical attention. Typically patients are able to recover without treatment, but keep in mind they may require IV fluids and/or antibiotics,\u201d she said.\n\nThose most at risk for developing a severe Salmonella infection are those with a weakened immune system, pregnant women, children and the elderly, she said. In fact, according to the CDC, children are at \u201cthe highest risk for Salmonella infection\" and kids who are 5 years old or less have \u201chigher rates of Salmonella infection than any other age group.\"", "", "", "Toyota is coming to the rescue of a nurse who has been heralded for risking his life to aid others during the Camp Fire Paradise, Calif., fire last week.\n\nAllyn Pierce was profiled in a New York Times story that recounted how he and some colleagues were stuck while trying to escape the fire surrounding the Adventist Health Feather River hospital, where he manages the intensive care unit, but when they had the opportunity to get clear, turned around and headed back to the hospital instead.\n\nThere, they pulled equipment outside of the endangered buildings and set up a triage center as people were evacuating the facility and the surrounding area.

Circuit Court of Appeals seat vacated by new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nTrump, speaking at a White House event marking Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, indicated that a formal announcement is slated for Wednesday, but said that tipping his hand early \"gives me a big story.\"\n\n\"We were going to announce that tomorrow and I said you know, here we are Neomi -- we're never gonna do better than this. I thought it was an appropriate place,\" Trump said, as attendees at the ceremony clapped and Rao smiled.\n\n\"I won't say today that I just nominated Neomi to be on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the seat of Justice Brett Kavanaugh,\" Trump continued. \"She's going to be fantastic -- great person.\"\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is considered the second most important U.S. federal court, after the U.S. Supreme Court, because it has jurisdiction over disputes concerning federal regulations and other actions taken by major government agencies. During his time on the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh ruled on major issues that found their way to the Supreme Court, including the constitutionality of ObamaCare's individual mandate and citywide gun bans that ran afoul of the Second Amendment.\n\nLIBERAL LAW PROFS LAUNCH CAMPAIGN TO PACK SUPREME COURT\n\nRao, like Kavanaugh when he was first nominated to the key appellate court, has never been a judge, and likely does not have any paper trail that would pose an obstacle to her confirmation by the Senate, which Republicans will continue to control in January. (Only a majority vote is needed to confirm appellate judges, because Senate Democrats eliminated the filibuster for nominees to clear the way for several appointees by Barack Obama to the bench that Republicans vowed to block.)\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which Rao leads, is part of the Office of Management and Budget within the Executive Branch. It has the statutory authority to review federal regulations established by an array of agencies, as well as oversight over information privacy and government data collection.\n\nCase Western University School of Law professor and Washington Post commentator Jonathan H. Adler wrote when Rao was nominated to lead the agency that \"Trump's selection of Rao suggests the administration is serious about regulatory reform, not merely reducing high-profile regulatory burdens.\" He called Rao's job \"the most important position which you may not have heard of before.\"\n\n\"The selection of a well-respected administrative law expert further suggests the administration recognizes the need to be attentive to legal constraints on administrative action and that meaningful reforms require more than issuing a few executive orders,\" Adler wrote, calling her Trump's \"regulatory czar.\"\n\nKAVANAUGH MAKES LOW-KEY SUPREME COURT DEBUT AFTER UNPRECEDENTED CONFIRMATION BATTLE\n\nHe concluded: \"Rao is a superlative pick.\"\n\nBut others were skeptical, saying Rao has led a reckless regulatory rollback that has endangered the environment. The Trump administration has repealed or tried to repeal dozens of Obama-era environmental regulations and policies, including rules restricting methane emissions on public lands.\n\nThe White House has also taken criticism for opening more coastal areas to offshore oil and gas drilling, and withdrawing from the contentious multilateral Paris climate agreement.\n\n\u201cRao has never seen a regulation she didn\u2019t hate, and as a judge would dismantle 40 years of environmental and social progress,\u201d Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement provided to Fox News. \u201cHer confirmation would be the most damaging and regressive yet by Trump after Kavanaugh and [Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil] Gorsuch.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have long complained that Congress often delegates excessive authority to mostly unaccountable executive branch agencies. During his confirmation hearings earlier this year, Kavanaugh specifically touched on the Obama-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), saying that even if the agency was a good policy idea, its creation was an improper \"departure from historical practice\" because it employed a single director, rather than a committee, who could only be removed by the president for cause.\n\nKavanaugh wrote an opinion for a three-judge panel striking down the CFPB's structure as unconstitutional in 2016, but was ultimately reversed in part by a 7-3 vote in an unusual en banc review by other justices on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The en banc review found the CFPB's structure to be constitutional, but agreed with Kavanaugh that one of the agency's major interpretive decisions had improperly violated due process requirements.\n\nThe Trump administration later stripped the CFPB of some of its enforcement capabilities.\n\nRao is on leave as a professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, which is unusual in legal academia for having a larger percentage of conservative-leaning faculty members than most other major law schools. The school, formerly known simply as the George Mason University School of Law, changed its name after Scalia's death, following major gifts from an anonymous donor and the Charles Koch Foundation that insisted on the name change.\n\nShe also served in President George W. Bush's administration and worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nAsked to say some words by the president, the seemingly flustered soon-to-be-nominee said she was humbled by the honor.\n\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. President, for the confidence you've shown in me,\" Rao said. \"I greatly appreciate it.\"", "Marine scientists made a major \u2014 and somewhat unexpected \u2014 discovery while surveying the ocean floor roughly 200 miles off the coast of Ireland: a \"very rare\" shark nursery.\n\nA school of adult sharks, identified as Blackmouth catsharks and Sailfin roughsharks, were spotted 2,500 feet below the surface by a remotely operated vehicle controlled by a team of scientists with the Marine Institute.

Verbruggen added it demonstrates the \"importance of mapping our seabed habitats.\"\n\n\"Our data and team continue to make significant contributions to harnessing our ocean wealth,\" he said.\n\nChief scientist David O\u2019Sullivan recalled the moment he witnessed the school of sharks swimming around eggs, which were covering piles of dead coral.\n\nGIANT GROUP OF OCTOPUS 'MOMS' DISCOVERED DURING DEEP SEA EXPEDITION: 'IT'S SUICIDE'\n\n\u201cIt was incredible, real David Attenborough stuff. This is a major biological find and a story of this magnitude would have been on Blue Planet if they\u2019d known about it,\u201d O'Sullivan told The Guardian. \u201cVery, very little is known on a global scale about deep-sea shark nurseries.\u201d\n\nIt's unusual to stumble upon such a sight that far underneath the ocean's surface. And little is known about the habits of both Blackmouth catsharks and Sailfin roughsharks.\n\n\u201cBoth species are of scientific interest as Ireland has an obligation to monitor deepwater sharks under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive,\" Maurice Clarke, who works at the Fisheries Ecosystem Advisory Services at the Marine Institute, said in an online statement.\n\nThe Sailfin roughshark is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) \"red list,\" as it is a threatened species. The slow-moving deep-sea shark is typically found anywhere from 870 to 2,500 feet below the surface and can grow up to nearly 4 feet long, according to Revolvy.\n\nTo further observe the biology of sharks at these depths, O'Sullivan said the team plans to return to the site next summer, hoping to catch some of the eggs hatching.\n\nA healthy coral reef in the vicinity may act as a refuge for the juvenile shark pups once they hatch. It is anticipated that further study of the site will answer some important scientific questions on the biology and ecology of deep water sharks in Irish waters,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan told the Marine Institute.", "Opening statements in Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's trial began Tuesday afternoon, following a delay brought on by a juror who was reportedly \"too anxious and too upset\" to serve on the jury.\n\nThe New York Post reports Juror No. 1 showed up with a doctor's note to back up her claims. This is the same woman who sobbed last week after she was chosen to serve on the jury.\n\nThe juror said she feared for her safety because Guzman, the most notorious drug trafficker in the world, is known for hiring sicarios, or hitmen, to kill potential witnesses and anyone helping the prosecution against him.\n\nFederal Judge Brian Cogan recognized these fears and ordered the jurors identities to remain anonymous and to be partially sequestered.\n\nGuzman faces 17 federal charges, including drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms charges. If convicted, the 61-year-old reputed Mexican drug lord will spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nProsecutors say Guzman ordered the killing of thousands and became the top supplier of cocaine, heroin, meth and marijuana in the United States.\n\n\"What made him so significant within the trafficking world was his mastery of logistics. He was the master at bringing drugs from South America into the United States,\" said Eric Olson, special adviser of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center. \"He also pioneered and excelled at the building of underground tunnels under theU.S. Mexican border.\"\n\nThe evidence includes over 300,000 documents, thousands of wiretap audio recordings, 200 metric tons of seized drugs and testimonies from dozens of witnesses.\n\nOne of those witnesses is Jesus Vicente Zambada, a 43-year-old who oversaw cartel logistics. He signed a plea deal and, if he cooperates, his sentence could be reduced from life in prison to as little as 10 years.\n\n\u201cEl Chapo\u201d famously escaped twice from Mexico's maximum security prisons.\n\nOnce in 2001, inside a laundry cart, and again in 2015 through a mile-long tunnel dug into his jail cell.\n\nAfter his recapture, he was extradited to the U.S. in January 2017.\n\n\"They did not agree to extradition initially but in the second escape the use of this sophisticated tunnel under a prison was very clear that Mexican institutions were not capable of effectively imprisoning him and there was real fear that if they brought him to trial they might not be able to prosecute them effectively,\" Olson told Fox News. \"Guzman was very effective at bribing people, buying off authorities, ensuring his impunity in that country and so that's why it became necessary, albeit embarrassing, but necessary for them to extradite him to the United States.\"\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service and the New York Police Department are not taking any chances.\n\nTwice a week, an armored caravan will shut down the Brooklyn Bridge transporting El Chapo to and from court in Brooklyn. He's been in solitary confinement in a Manhattan jail during the past 21 months.\n\nThis trial is expected to last about four months. El Chapo's lawyers say he's being framed.\n\nMeanwhile in Mexico, the drug violence hasn't only continued since El Chapo was captured - it's gotten worse.\n\nAccording to a report released by Mexico's government in July 2018 by the National Statistics Institute, the number of murders rose 27 percent in 2017, to 31,174 \u2013 the most on record going back to 1990.\n\n\"Each leader you take off the field is replaced by someone behind them and reconstituted and that's why without a change in the supply and demand for drugs these individual criminal leaders as bad as they are and as important as it is to prosecute them, do not necessarily ultimately alter the trafficking business,\" Olson explained.\n\nOlson said it was critical to capture Guzman but it didn\u2019t make the problem go away.\n\n\"As important as it is to extradite him and prosecute Chapo Guzman,\u201d Olson said, \u201csometimes those actions create fractures within the criminal structures that then turn more violent as they compete with each other, they fight with each other and you actually see violence going up \u2013 not going down.\"", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nAll Eyes on Florida!

The paper added that the first lady's office suspects Ricardel of leaking negative stories about the first lady and her staff.\n\nThe Journal also reported that Ricardel has sparred with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis over policy differences and staffing decisions. The Washington Post, citing three current and two former White House officials, reported that Ricardel had berated people in meetings and spread rumors about Mattis. The paper also reported that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has sought Ricardel's ouster for months.\n\nRicardel, 58, assumed the post of deputy national security adviser in May, one month after Trump appointed John Bolton as national security adviser to replace Henry McMaster. She attended a White House ceremony Tuesday with Trump celebrating Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights.\n\nMelania Trump traveled to Ghana, Mali, Kenya and Egypt last month.

Although the painting is fragmented, experts from Israel\u2019s University of Haifa were able to make out the facial outline. Their research was published recently in the journal Antiquity.\n\nThe painting, which is believed to date from the sixth century, depicts Jesus as a short-haired youth.\n\n'SHIPS IN THE DESERT': STRANGE 2,000-YEAR-OLD GRAFFITI DISCOVERED IN ISRAEL\n\n\u201cChrist\u2019s face in this painting is an important discovery in itself,\u201d they explained in their paper. \u201cIt belongs to the iconographic scheme of a short-haired Christ, which was especially widespread in Egypt and Syro-Palestine, but gone from later Byzantine art.\u201d\n\nThe painting was briefly noted in the 1920s, but has now undergone more analysis. In their study, the University of Haifa archaeologists explain that Christ is depicted next to a much larger figure, which is probably John the Baptist. \u201cThe location of the scene \u2013 above the [church\u2019s] crucifix-shaped Baptist font \u2013 suggests its identification as the baptism of Christ,\u201d said the study\u2019s authors.\n\nExperts describe the painting\u2019s discovery as extremely important, noting that it predates the religious iconography used in the Orthodox Christian Church. \u201cThus far, it is the only in situ baptism-of-Christ scene to date confidently to the pre-iconoclastic Holy Land,\u201d they said in the study. \u201cTherefore, it can illuminate Byzantine Shivta\u2019s Christian community and Early Christian art across the region.\u201d\n\nANCIENT INSCRIPTION DISCOVERY THRILLS ARCHAEOLOGISTS IN ISRAEL\n\nThe painting is the latest fascinating archaeological discovery in Israel. Engravings of ships, for example, were recently found on an ancient water cistern discovered in a city in the Negev desert.\n\nIn a separate project, archaeologists recently confirmed the first full spelling of \u201cJerusalem\u201d on an ancient stone inscription excavated in the area of Jerusalem\u2019s International Convention Center, known as Binyanei Ha'Uma.\n\nIn another project, experts discovered a site that may offer fresh insight into the ancient biblical kingdom of David and Solomon. In a separate archaeological dig, a trove of bronze coins, the last remnants of an ancient Jewish revolt against the Roman Empire, were recently discovered near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\n\nSTUNNING BIBLICAL 'SPIES' MOSAIC DISCOVERED IN ISRAEL\n\nIn February, archaeologists announced the discovery of a clay seal mark that may bear the signature of the biblical Prophet Isaiah.\n\nOther recent finds include the skeleton of a pregnant woman, dating back 3,200 years, in Israel\u2019s Timna Valley, at a place once called King Solomon\u2019s Mines.\n\nAt the site of an ancient city on the West Bank, archaeologists are also hunting for evidence of the tabernacle that once housed the Ark of the Covenant.\n\nLOST ROMAN CITY THAT WAS HOME TO JESUS' APOSTLES FOUND, SAY ARCHAEOLOGISTS\n\nSome experts also believe they have found the lost Roman city of Julias, formerly the village of Bethsaida, which was the home of Jesus' apostles Peter, Andrew and Philip.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers", "A slew of grievances and major underlying issues have Israel and Hamas locked in a spiral of violence that has caused three wars in the last decade and repeated rounds of deadly fighting.\n\nWith an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, a riven Palestinian leadership and a militant Hamas, Gaza's predicament remains seemingly unsolvable.\n\nHere is a look at each side's demands and what is keeping them in conflict:\n\nHAMAS\n\nThe Islamic militant group has ruled Gaza since a violent 2007 takeover of the territory from forces loyal to the Western-backed President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nHamas, which rose to global prominence with suicide bombings in the 1990s and 2000s that killed hundreds of Israelis, is sworn to Israel's destruction and has never accepted peace accords. It has set up a de facto government in the Gaza Strip, where it is responsible for managing the daily lives of some 2 million Palestinians.\n\nIsrael, which along with its Western allies considers Hamas a terrorist group, joined with Egypt to impose a blockade on Gaza after the Hamas takeover, eviscerating the local economy. Jobs are hard to come by, Gaza's beaches are polluted by untreated sewage and tap water is undrinkable.\n\nThe blockade greatly restricts the movement of people out of the tiny territory, making it difficult to do business or travel abroad for work, school or family reasons.\n\nHamas wants Israel and Egypt to lift the blockade and it has led weekly protests since March aimed at busting it. Fueled in part by desperation, thousands have attended, with some burning tires, throwing rocks and grenades at Israeli troops and damaging the perimeter fence. More than 170 protesters have been killed by Israeli fire since the protests began.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against attackers. But it has come under heavy international criticism for the large number of unarmed people who have been shot.\n\n___\n\nISRAEL\n\nIsrael, which withdrew from the Gaza Strip in 2005 after 38 years of occupation, says it has no choice but to enforce the blockade, accusing Hamas of trying to smuggle weapons into the territory.\n\nIsrael claims some credit for keeping border crossings open, allowing food, consumer goods and some construction materials to flow into the territory. It also has asked the international community, which already funnels hundreds of millions of dollars a year into Gaza, to increase aid.\n\nOver the years, Hamas has amassed a vast arsenal of rockets and other weapons which it has fired sporadically at Israeli communities along with other Gaza militants. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars, including one in 2014 that exposed a network of underground tunnels leading into Israel from Gaza, prompting Israeli accusations that Hamas uses material meant for Gaza's reconstruction for its war infrastructure.\n\nDespite its recognition that the economic situation in Gaza could lead to a humanitarian crisis, Israel says no political resolution can be reached so long as Hamas remains in power. Hamas has refused to disarm or disavow its opposition to Israel.\n\n___\n\nTHE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY\n\nCompounding the situation has been a yearslong rift between Hamas and Abbas' Fatah faction. Attempts to reconcile have repeatedly failed, leaving the Palestinians divided between rival governments in the West Bank and Gaza. The talks have repeatedly broken down over Hamas' refusal to disarm.\n\nAbbas is fearful of any political settlement that would separate Gaza from the West Bank and entrench Hamas rule.\n\nHe has slashed the salaries of thousands of former government workers in Gaza and cut fuel subsidies to pay for electricity, all in an effort to step up pressure on Hamas. He has also thwarted a series of internationally-backed initiatives aimed at rehabilitating Gaza, worried that they could help Hamas.\n\nThese measures, combined with the decade-long blockade, have sent Gaza's economy into freefall, prompting the increasingly desperate Hamas to step up the mass border protests.", "Space enthusiasts have spotted what they claim is a mythical \"creature\" hidden in the swirls of Jupiter's cloud system.\n\nNASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory recently revealed a new, stunning image from its Juno spacecraft, which is currently circling the giant planet.

The Vatican, he said, was ordering the bishops to delay votes on two anti-abuse proposals until after a Vatican-convened global meeting on sex abuse in February.\n\nDiNardo indicated there were two principal reasons for the Vatican order: to ensure that steps taken by the U.S. bishops would be in harmony with steps decided at the February meeting, and to provide more time for vetting aspects of the U.S. proposals that might conflict with church law.\n\nEven without the option of a formal vote this week, the U.S. bishops proceeded with discussion of the two key proposals. One would establish a new code of conduct of individual bishops; the other would create a nine-member special commission, including six lay experts and three members of the clergy, to review complaints against the bishops.\n\nThe lay members would include experts in law enforcement, social work and psychology, as well as at least one survivor of clergy abuse, Detroit Archbishop Allen Vigneron said.\n\nHowever, the bishops are under pressure to take additional steps, as stressed in an address to the assembly Tuesday by Francesco Cesareo, chairman of the National Review Board, which the bishops created in 2002 to monitor the church's efforts to prevent clergy sex abuse.\n\n\"Your response to this crisis has been incomplete,\" said Cesareo, calling for more accountability. \"It is shameful that the sin of abuse was hidden and allowed to fester until uncovered by the secular world.\"\n\nHe cited the grand jury report released in August in Pennsylvania. It detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has begun working on a federal criminal case centered on child exploitation, and attorneys general in at least 11 other states have launched investigations.\n\n\"How many souls have been lost because of this crisis?\" Cesareo said.\n\nHe urged all U.S. bishops to commit to conducting a thorough review of their dioceses' files, dating to at least 1950, and publicly sharing a list of any clergy who have been credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable adults.\n\nSome bishops had taken this step, he noted, and urged the others to follow suit.\n\nCesareo also endorsed the bishop conference's proposal for a thorough investigation of the scandal involving disgraced church leader Theodore McCarrick. Pope Francis removed McCarrick as a cardinal in July after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible.\n\nSubsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported they too had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults, triggering debate over who might have known and covered up McCarrick's misconduct.\n\nAt one point during the morning session, Bishop Shawn McKnight, of Jefferson City, Missouri, expressed dismay that the Vatican \"doesn't trust us\" and asked Cesareo what the USCCB should do.\n\n\"Decisively act on this issue and continually move it forward,\" Cesareo replied. \"If that doesn't happen, I fear for the future of our church.\"\n\nAmong those attending the assembly was James Timlin, a retired Pennsylvania bishop who was faulted by the state grand jury for his handling of clergy sex abuse and barred from representing the diocese in public.\n\nAlso on hand was former Bishop Robert Finn, who once led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, and pleaded guilty to failing to report a suspected priestly child abuser. Pope Francis in 2015 accepted Finn's resignation, offered under the code of canon law that allows bishops to resign early for illness or some \"grave\" reason that makes them unfit for office.\n\nBishop Christopher Coyne of Burlington, Vermont, said the USCCB didn't have the authority to ban any ordained bishop, active or retired, from attending the assembly.\n\nOutside the conference venue along Baltimore's waterfront, hundreds of people gathered in a protest rally organized by far-right Catholics, including the group Church Militant. Some held placards denouncing homosexuality in the priesthood, asserting that it was behind clergy sex abuse.\n\nUlana Campbell, of Wilmington, Delaware, was one of roughly 400 participants at the rally. She said the bishops appeared incapable of stopping clergy sex abuse.\n\n\"These bishops are absolutely corrupted by power. I think the true church is going to have to go underground,\" Campbell said. \"I am an angry Catholic, but I refuse to leave my faith.\"\n\n___\n\nCrary reported from New York.", "Two years after the brutal, execution-style slaying of eight family members in Ohio shocked the nation, authorities announced Tuesday that four members of a different family had been arrested and accused of carrying out the murders.\n\nOhio Attorney General Mike DeWine said the suspects -- a husband, wife, and their two adult sons -- were arrested in connection with the Rhoden family murders.\n\n\"Following an extensive investigation by my office\u2019s #OhioBCI and the #PikeCounty Sheriff\u2019s Office, we have arrested four people accused of the murders of eight people in Pike County on April 22, 2016,\" DeWine tweeted.\n\nThe four suspects arrested were identified as: George \"Billy\" Wagner III, Angela Wagner and sons George Wagner IV and Edward \"Jake\" Wagner.\n\nThe four murder suspects were each charged with eight counts of aggravated murder \u2014 one count for each person killed \u2014 each with death penalty specifications, investigators announced at a later press conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe Wagners had \"close business and family relations\" with the Rhoden family before the April 2016 murders, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. The killings in Piketon, located 70 miles south of Columbus, sparked the largest homicide investigation in Ohio history.\n\nLast year, authorities announced they were looking for the Wagners and information on them, according to FOX19.\n\nEdward \"Jake\" Wagner has a young daughter, Sophia, with Hanna Rhoden. The Wagners were not initially named as suspects or persons of interest, but had moved to Kenai, Alaska two months after the killings before moving back to Ohio over the summer. In August of this year, FOX19 reported that two properties were searched in connection with the killings, but authorities never disclosed what was seized.\n\nAutopsy reports released earlier this year revealed the sheer brutality of the massacre, and how one of the victims tried to fight back.\n\nThe report in September revealed Christopher Rhoden Sr. -- the father of three people killed that day -- was shot nine times and, it was noted, his body was decomposed \u201cmore than all the others.\u201d He appeared to have suffered a defensive wound to his right forearm and that another bullet went through a door before hitting him, the Enquirer reported at the time. His body was found in the back bedroom of a trailer.\n\nGary Rhoden, Christopher Rhoden Sr.\u2019s cousin, was also found dead in the same trailer, according to the newspaper.

Investigators scrambling to determine who targeted the Rhoden family and why had conducted over 130 interviews and processed over 100 pieces of evidence and 550 tips, while getting assistance from more than 20 law enforcement agencies.\n\nAuthorities had refused to discuss many details about the slayings, saying they didn't want to tip their hand to whoever was responsible for the shootings.

Guidelines used to begin at age 6, but the new ones say preschoolers ages 3 through 5 should be encouraged to take part in active play throughout the day. They don\u2019t call for a certain amount but say a reasonable target may be three hours of various intensities. That\u2019s consistent with guidelines in many other countries and is the average amount of activity observed in kids this age.\n\nFrom ages 6 through 17, at least an hour of moderate-to-vigorous activity throughout the day is recommended. Most of it should be aerobic, the kind that gets the heart rate up such as brisk walking, biking or running. At least three times a week, exercise should be vigorous and include muscle- and bone-strengthening activities like climbing on playground equipment or playing sports.\n\nAdults\n\nDuration stays the same \u2014 at least 2\u00bd to 5 hours of moderate-intensity or 1 \u00bc to 2 \u00bd hours of vigorous activity a week, plus at least two days that include muscle-strengthening exercise like pushups or lifting weights.\n\nOne key change: It used to be thought that aerobic activity had to be done for at least 10 minutes. Now even short times are known to help. Even a single episode of activity gives short-term benefits such as lowering blood pressure, reducing anxiety and improving sleep. Sitting a lot is especially harmful.\n\nThe advice is similar for older adults, but activities should include things that promote balance to help avoid falls.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nBrought to you by the letter E\n\nTargeting young children is the goal of a project that Dr. Valentin Fuster, a cardiologist at New York\u2019s Mount Sinai Hospital, has worked on for years with the Heart Association and Sesame Workshop, producers of television\u2019s \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\n\nAt the heart conference, he gave results of an intensive four-month program to improve knowledge and attitudes about exercise and health among 562 kids ages 3 to 5 in Head Start preschools in Harlem.\n\n\u201cIt was really successful,\u201d Fuster said. \u201cOnce they understand how the body works, they begin to understand physical activity\u201d and its importance.\n\nWhen brains are young, \u201cit\u2019s the best opportunity\u201d to set healthy habits that last, he said.", "Last Tuesday I was proud to see that the American people voted keep Republicans in control of the U.S. Senate. But we also learned that, come January, the Republican Senate majority will be dealing with a House of Representatives under Democratic control.\n\nNeedless to say, the past two years of unified Republican government will be remembered as a period of historic productivity.\n\nBoth houses of Congress have taken swift action to right-size a bloated federal regulatory state. The Senate has shattered records in confirming the president\u2019s well-qualified judicial nominees, including two outstanding jurists to serve on the Supreme Court\n\nAnd together, we passed the first comprehensive reform of the nation\u2019s tax code in a generation. Already, Americans\u2019 paychecks are growing, consumer confidence is high and unemployment has reached a near 50-year low.\n\nAfter this prolific run, I was not surprised to be asked over the past week about just how much the American people can expect from the next Congress under divided leadership. What can we realistically accomplish?\n\nI have good news: reports of the death of bipartisanship in Washington have been wildly exaggerated. In fact, some of the most significant accomplishments of this Congress have been delivered with overwhelmingly bipartisan support.\n\nUnder bipartisan committee leadership, we took major steps toward restoring regular order to our appropriations process. The Senate passed more funding measures before the beginning of this fiscal year than at any point in the last two decades.\n\nThe measures included the largest year-on-year increase in defense funding in 15 years, which put an end to the Obama-era atrophy of our armed forces.\n\nWorking closely with counterparts in the House, we found common ground on rebuilding America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. In fact, America\u2019s Water Infrastructure Act \u2013 designed to improve interstate commerce, water quality and flood safety \u2013 passed the Senate by a vote of 99-1.\n\nAnd in August, the Senate voted unanimously to expand Americans\u2019 opportunities to receive technical and career-focused education.\n\nWe\u2019ve passed 22 pieces of legislation produced by the bipartisan work of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee. From improving the efficiency of Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities to enhancing access to post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits, each of these pieces of legislation was designed to help America keep its promises to returning heroes and their families.\n\nAnd last month, the Senate passed a landmark package of targeted resources to combat the opioid epidemic. The legislation was produced by five bipartisan committees and included direct input from 72 different senators.\n\nOf course, these are just a few highlights of a Congress that has conducted as much serious, cooperative work as any in recent history.\n\nSo make no mistake. The Senate has proven its ability to reach bipartisan solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation.\n\nAnd looking ahead to the coming year, there will be no shortage of opportunities to continue this impressive record of cooperation across the aisle and across the Capitol.\n\nWhat we can make of those opportunities will depend on our Democratic colleagues. Will they choose to go it alone and simply make political points? Or will they choose to work together and actually make a difference?\n\nLast week, the American people made it abundantly clear that they prefer that Congress focus on making a difference.\n\nThat message may have been lost on a few House Democrats, who have made clear their preference for investigations over policy results. After years of rhetoric, it\u2019s hardly news that some are more interested in fanning the flames of division than reaching across the aisle.\n\nBut however Democrats interpret the latest message from voters, Senate Republicans will continue our commitment to delivering results.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep working to lift the burden on American job creators and small businesses. We\u2019ll stay focused on helping communities across the country seize new opportunities and realize greater prosperity. We\u2019ll seek new ways to make life easier for working families.\n\nMost importantly, in the face of whichever tactics the far left chooses to employ next, we\u2019ll continue to stand for the rule of law. We\u2019ll continue to confirm more well-qualified nominees to serve on our nation\u2019s courts.\n\nThis is what the Senate\u2019s Republican majority was elected to do. And we\u2019ll continue to get it done.", "Macedonia will seek the arrest with an international warrant of conservative former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski after confirming he fled to Hungary to avoid serving a two-year prison sentence for corruption, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nThe Interior Ministry responded nearly five hours after Gruevski announced he was in Budapest in a Facebook post, as police continued searches in the capital Skopje to try and locate him.\n\nThe 48-year-old Gruevski who ignored a summons on Monday to appear at a Skopje prison to serve a two-year sentence after being convicted influencing officials to purchase a luxury car for government use. He also faces trial in four other cases that emerged from a wiretapping scandal which erupted in 2015 and plunged the country into a deep political crisis. He has been charged with abuse of office, electoral fraud, criminal association and incitement to violence.\n\nHe had surrendered his passport and it was unclear how he reached Hungary.\n\nGruevski was prime minister from 2006-2016. He is the former leader of the conservative VMRO-DPMNE party, which is the main opposition party which is allied with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing Fidesz party.\n\nContacted by The Associated Press, the Hungarian prime minister's office refused to confirm or deny Gruevski's presence, adding that \"ongoing asylum procedures\" couldn't be commented upon.\n\nGruevski's flight marks the latest dramatic episode in a volatile confrontation between his conservatives and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's Social Democrats.\n\nThe two sides remain bitterly at odds over a proposed deal to change the republic's name to North Macedonia and end a dispute with neighboring Greece that would allow Macedonia to join NATO. Western leaders provided Zaev's government strong backing in supporting the deal, while Russia argued that it was the target of the alliance's expansion eastward.\n\nThe Social Democrats accused Gruevski of making a \"cowardly escape.\"\n\n___\n\nPablo Gorondi reported from Budapest, Hungary", "Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Napolitano joined Fox News Radio's Marie Harf to discuss CNN's lawsuit against the Trump administration and Whitaker's appointment as acting U.S. Attorney General.\n\nOn CNN's lawsuit against the Trump administration: I think they have a very strong case. They make three claims against six defendants, the President, General Kelly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Bill Shine, the head of the Secret Service, and the particular Secret Service agent who physically took Jim Acosta's credentials from him. They don't know that person's name so he's sued under John Doe. The essence of the argument is this. One, he was punished for expressing an opinion, so that violates the First Amendment. Two, he lost a privilege without a hearing, so that violates the Fifth Amendment. Three, they made up a rule to get rid of him and that violates something called the Administrative Procedures Act because administrative regulations like who gets to come into the White House or regulations that can be promulgated by the president but they have to follow a procedure before they can do that. (1:05)\n\nOn the White House saying he assaulted a female intern: There's no assault there... The woman tried to take, at the direction of the President, the microphone away from him. He held it closer to his body rather than out at the end of his hand so that she could take it. He no more assaulted her than I did and I was 300 miles away when this happened. (4:27)\n\nOn the acting US Attorney General Whitaker: Is he legally eligible to be Attorney General? The answer to that is a very clear cut no. Thanks to the Constitution and to language that Congress wrote to make certain that no runs the Justice Department who has not been nominated by the President and had their legal philosophy explored by the Senate and then been confirmed by the Senate. That is particularly important in this case because Mr. Whitaker has articulated views that are so wide of the mark, so contrary to mainstream American jurisprudence. (1:03)\n\nOn if the state of Maryland has standing in their case: The state of Maryland does have standing because they're in litigation over the Affordable Care Act against the Justice Department, which has decided not to defend certain portions of the Affordable Care Act, even though one of the portions that they don't want to defend is a portion the President loves, which is the coverage for pre-existing conditions.

Schalit is released five years later following a lopsided prisoner exchange.\n\n___\n\nJune 2007\n\nHamas violently ousts Fatah forces from the Gaza Strip and solidifies its control of the territory. Israel and Egypt tighten their blockade of Gaza, which will devastate Gaza's economy over the next decade. Two rival governments emerge, Hamas in Gaza and the Abbas' Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.\n\n___\n\nDecember 2008\n\nIn response to heavy rocket fire from Gaza, Israel launches a major three-week offensive. After a 22-day war that kills 1,200 Palestinians and 13 Israelis, the two sides announce a cease-fire.\n\n___\n\nNovember 2012\n\nIsrael targets and kills Hamas military chief Ahmad Jabari, sparking eight days of militant rocket fire and an Israeli air campaign. Egyptian mediators secure a cease-fire after some 150 Palestinians and six Israelis are killed.\n\n___\n\nJuly-August 2014\n\nFollowing the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers by Hamas members, Israel conducts a sweep against Hamas in the West Bank, prompting rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli air raids in response. The seven-week conflict that ensues results in more than 2,200 Palestinian deaths in Gaza, more than half of them civilians. In Israel, 67 soldiers and 6 civilians are killed. Israel comes under heavy international criticism for its use of what the United Nations calls disproportionate force.\n\n___\n\nMarch 2018\n\nPalestinian protesters, led by Hamas, stage massive demonstrations along the perimeter fence against the blockade. Although mostly unarmed, many protesters burn tires, throw rocks and grenades at Israeli troops and damage the perimeter fence. Israeli troops kill more than 170 protesters over a period of several months. Israel says it is defending its border but is accused of using excessive force. Israel and Hamas engage in a number of rounds of intense but brief fighting during this time.\n\n___\n\nNovember 2018:\n\nViolence flares up after a botched Israeli undercover raid into Gaza that killed seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli army officer, marking the most serious escalation since the war in 2014. Gaza militants fire hundreds of rockets at Israel in response, killing a Palestinian laborer in southern Israel. At least seven Palestinians, among them five militants, are killed in Gaza.", "President Trump on Tuesday pushed back on reports North Korea has several secret, smaller missile bases stashed in the mountains, calling the claims \u201cinaccurate\u201d and \u201cjust more fake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story in the New York Times concerning North Korea developing missile bases is inaccurate. We fully know about the sites being discussed, nothing new - and nothing happening out of the normal. Just more Fake News. I will be the first to let you know if things go bad!\u201d Trump tweeted the day after the report's release.\n\nThe New York Times and other outlets, including Fox News, reported Monday on a think tank's analysis of satellite images that allegedly showed the Hermit Kingdom had 16 hidden missile operating bases that were not acknowledged by North Korean officials.\n\nNORTH KOREA POSSIBLY HIDING MISSILE OPERATING BASES DESPITE DENUCLEARIZATION PLEDGE, THINK TANK SAYS\n\nThe new images, released by the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 Beyond Parallel program, showed a possible base in Sakkanmol, about 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone, equipped with what CSIS says are headquarter buildings, barracks, maintenance depots and entrances to underground tunnels that can hide missiles and transport trucks.\n\nThe report identified about 15 to 20 bases being operated by the Korean People\u2019s Army's Strategic Force, based on information from officials in the government, defense and intelligence agencies and North Korean defectors.\n\nTrump\u2019s statement comes about a week after he reassured critics that denuclearization talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were continuing despite recent hurdles.\n\n\u201cWe are in no rush,\u201d Trump told reporters last Wednesday. \u201cThe sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea also took a step toward denuclearization when officials agreed to allow international inspectors into its nuclear and missile sites \u2014 a step North Korea had repeatedly refused to take in the past. The move came after South Korea's National Intelligence Service observed late last month there were \u201csigns\u201d the regime was preparing to allow \u201coutside experts\u201d to survey the country's Punggye-ri nuclear test site.\n\nBut roadblocks still remain.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s meeting with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, scheduled for last Thursday in New York was canceled. The State Department said it will \u201ctake place at a later date,\u201d though details have not been announced.\n\nAdding to recent troubles with denuclearization talks, North Korea has continued to lash out at the U.S. and threatened to resume building up its \u201cnuclear forces.\" The regime, through its state-run Korean Central News Agency, has accused the U.S. of \u201cnuclear blackmail.\u201d", "The family of a top-ranking official from the Vermont National Guard says that an aggressive form of pancreatic cancer has left him with only a short time to live and that his dire situation is due to his exposure to burn pits while he served overseas.\n\nBrigadier General Michael T. Heston, who also was one of the highest ranking members of his state's National Guard when he served as Assistant Adjutant General, completed a total of three tours in Afghanistan from 2003 to 2012. Each time, he was exposed to the toxic clouds that emanated from burn pits-- a system of waste disposal, used on military bases, where everything from plastics to batteries to appliances to medical and human waste was thrown into open-air dumps, doused with jet fuel, and set ablaze. At nearly every single base where Heston was stationed, active burn pits were near their barracks and other common areas.\n\nLess than a decade since he returned from service, Heston is now fighting terminal Stage IV pancreatic cancer.\n\n\u201cHe had been in treatment until this past September,\u201d Heston\u2019s wife, June, said in an interview with Fox News. \u201cHe stopped chemo [therapy] and then started radiation treatment until two weeks ago, when they told him that there was nothing more that they can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like once they told him, he\u2019s been very ill. There\u2019s no treatment left for him.\u201d\n\nHeston, who also was a Vermont State Trooper and is currently in home hospice care, commanded at all levels throughout his 34-year career, starting with platoons and working his way up to brigades. He returned in 2012 and started feeling symptoms in March 2016. What started as back pain turned out to be cancer, but June says it took nearly 10 months for him to get a proper diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThey spent months trying to figure it out,\u201d she says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the test that would have shown his cancer.\u201d\n\nJune adds that they went to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where he finally got the diagnosis that he and his family feared.\n\n\u201cThey said it was a rare form of cancer. Where have we heard that before?\u201d June asked, referring to the number of veterans who fell ill after being exposed to burn pits.\n\nTens of thousands of veterans reportedly believe their health has been compromised by the polluting smoke expelled from burn pits on their bases.\n\nThe burn pit method was originally a temporary measure during the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan as a way to quickly dispose of waste and garbage on military installations. The vets claim their prolonged exposure to toxic air left tens of thousands of them, as well as private contractors, with a myriad of illnesses including various forms of cancer and severe respiratory issues. Many succumbed to their illness, but nearly all who feared they got sick from exposure to burn pits never received proper help from the country they went to war to defend.\n\nA registry was created by the Veterans Administration in 2011, but signing it does not guarantee any form of assistance. Service members and their families concerned with the effects of burn pit exposure say they struggle to keep up with the high cost of medical treatments. There are more than 140,000 names signed to the VA registry.\n\nHeston was one of those veterans who signed the registry and urged others to do so, as well.\n\n\u201cHe put out a note to all his soldiers to sign up for that registry,\u201d his wife said. \u201cHe was big on that. He always said that if the VA created a registry, we know we have a problem.\u201d\n\nHeston and his family initially had trouble navigating claim filings with the Pentagon and the Veterans Administration.\n\n\u201cHe was denied a claim from the Defense Department, but luckily, the VA accepted and he has gotten a disability claim,\u201d June said, adding that she is sharing her husband\u2019s story in hopes that it will help those veterans who were not as fortunate.\n\n\u201cWe were one of the lucky ones, but what about all those vets who weren\u2019t so lucky?\u201d\n\nJune and her family are now waiting for the worst and say that many other veterans and their families will continue to deal with this new reality.\n\n\u201cThe rate of cancer is higher among veterans when compared to other people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt will be like Agent Orange again.\u201d\n\nSenator Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, where he has worked on the issue, said, \u201cMike Heston has been a dedicated public servant and the very definition of a true leader as long as I have known him. True to form, he has transformed his own difficult personal struggle with cancer into a fight for the men and women of the Vermont National Guard and throughout the nation who may be suffering from exposure to airborne hazards from burn pits.\u201d", "Sorry, honey \u2013 I can't tonight. Blame climate change.\n\nA new study highlights the risks that heatwaves can alter species' population numbers over time, resulting in drastically lower sperm counts for insects and could impact other groups for years to come. The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\n\"We know that biodiversity is suffering under climate change, but the specific causes and sensitivities are hard to pin down,\" said Research group leader Prof Matt Gage in a statement. \"We've shown in this work that sperm function is an especially sensitive trait when the environment heats up, and in a model system representing a huge amount of global biodiversity.\"\n\nSCIENTIST: DECLINE IN FOREST INSECTS IS 'HYPERALARMING'\n\nGage continued: \"Since sperm function is essential for reproduction and population viability, these findings could provide one explanation for why biodiversity is suffering under climate change. A warmer atmosphere will be more volatile and hazardous, with extreme events like heatwaves becoming increasingly frequent, intense and widespread.\"\n\nThe researchers looked at the red flour beetle to get the effects of simulated heatwaves on male reproduction. They were exposed to standard control conditions or a five-day heatwave where the temperatures ranged between 5\u00b0C and 7\u00b0C \"above their thermal optimum,\" the statement added.\n\nAs a result, the researchers learned that the climate-controlled group had no problems reproducing, but those that were exposed to the harsher conditions suffered serious setbacks. The heatwaves \"halved\" the number of offspring produced and a second heatwave almost caused them to become sterile.\n\n\"Heatwaves are particularly damaging extreme weather events,\" Gage added in the statement. \"Local extinctions are known to occur when temperature changes become too intense. We wanted to know why this happens. And one answer could be related to sperm.\"\n\nAfter the rise in temperatures, sperm count fell by three-quarters and \"any sperm produced then struggled to migrate into the female tract and were more likely to die before fertilization,\" according to the statement.\n\nFemales, however, were not affected by the warmer conditions.\n\n\"Our research shows that heatwaves halve male reproductive fitness, and it was surprising how consistent the effect was,\" said Kirs Sales, a postgraduate researcher who led the research.\n\nWhile concerning in the short-term, there are significant longer-term implications as well, with Sales citing \"the impacts of heatwaves on future generations.\"\n\nTHIS COFFIN-SHAPED ICEBERG IS HEADED TO DIE\n\n\"When males were exposed to two heatwave events 10 days apart, their offspring production was less than 1 percent of the control group,\" Sales said. \"Insects in nature are likely to experience multiple heatwave events, which could become a problem for population productivity if male reproduction cannot adapt or recover.\"\n\nOf the offspring that did survive, they lived a shorter life-span, up to a few months shorter, the researcher found. There were also problems with male offspring, as some were found to be less fertile as a result of their fathers' exposure to the heatwave-like conditions.\n\nBeetles are believed to represent a quarter of biodiversity, Sales added, making these results concerning for how other species will react to climate change.\n\n\"Research has also shown that heat shock can damage male reproduction in warm-blooded animals too, and past work has shown that this leads to infertility in mammals,\" Sales added.\n\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia", "For nearly a decade, researchers with Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond would conduct a trawl survey on the James River, never to come across any baby Atlantic sturgeon \u2014 a species that was listed as endangered in 2012.\n\nBut recently that changed, raising researchers\u2019 hopes that what the university says was \u201conce-plentiful ancient fish\u201d is making a comeback in the area.\n\nVIRAL VIDEO SHOWS FISHERMAN SHOT WITH INK WHILE TRYING TO REEL IN SQUID\n\nResearchers with the Rice Rivers Center \u2014 which \u201cis at the center of the Virginia Sturgeon Restoration Team\u2019s effort to restore the sturgeon to its native range and historical stature within state waters,\u201d according to a news release from Virginia Commonwealth University \u2014 found the fish earlier this month while conducting a trawl survey, a method of catching fish with a net attached to a boat.\n\nAs of Monday, nearly 148 baby sturgeon have been found in the James River.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited,\u201d one of the researchers, Matt Balazik, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s been very encouraging. After going out all those times and catching nothing, it\u2019s been rewarding to start to see these fish at this stage.\u201d\n\nThough researchers have previously identified more than 600 different adult sturgeon, the \u201cimbalance between researchers\u2019 findings of adult fish and younger fish has been a source of concern because it indicates possible issues preventing survival at a rate to sustain the population in the James,\u201d the university explained.\n\n\u201cIt's exciting, but we knew that this was going on. We knew that there were fish at this age and size class because the fish are spawning. But the fact that we're catching so many this year when we haven\u2019t caught any in previous years makes me really hopeful that this will be a bumper crop year and we\u2019ll get a bunch of 1-year-olds next year,\u201d Balazik said, adding he will \u201cstarting popping the champagne\u201d if \u201cwe\u2019re catching a bunch of age-1 fish\u201d next year.\n\nAtlantic sturgeon, which typically live for more than 50 years, have been affected by overfishing and habitat loss since the early 1900s, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. Atlantic sturgeon eggs, specifically, were used as a \u201chigh quality\u201d caviar in the late 1800s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nFemale sturgeon in the James River typically reach sexual maturity around 15 years of age compared to males' roughly 10 years \u2014 key ages to ensure the population will continue to grow.\n\n\u201cBut once they get to age 1, age 2, most likely they will make it to maturity and start to reproduce themselves and be recruited to the sturgeon population of the James. That\u2019s why we're hoping to see a bunch of 1-year-olds next year this time,\u201d Balazik continued. \u201cThat would be a great sign for the future of the sturgeon in the James.\u201d\n\nCALIFORNIA TEEN BITTEN BY SHARK OFFERED FREE LIFETIME FISHING LICENSE\n\nMoving forward, researchers are tracking the fishes\u2019 drifting patterns and are continuing to document any baby Atlantic sturgeon they find.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see these fish, though they still have a long way to go and a lot to deal with in natural mortality, mostly through predation, but what we\u2019re really hoping is that we see them again next year,\u201d Balazik added, noting he\u2019s not sure whether the \u201cgood bumper year\u201d was caused by heavy rains which made for good river flow or there was \u201ca lot of good spawning habitat this year.\"", "Ethiopia has detained the former head of a large military-run industrial conglomerate, a day after the country's attorney general disclosed that several hundred million dollars was embezzled from the firm.\n\nThe state broadcaster ETV reported that Maj.

That was unusual, as the ancient Greeks typically buried their dead in organized cemeteries outside the city walls.\n\nLead archaeologist Elena Korka, who has been excavating in the area since 2013, told The Associated Press that her team had only been digging in the rich cemeteries surrounding Tenea until this year. In one, antiquities smugglers dug up two remarkable 6th century B.C. marble statues of young men in 2010 and tried to sell them for 10 million euros.\n\n\"This year we excavated part of the city itself,\" Korka said.\n\nExcavation work continues on the cemeteries, located near the modern village of Hiliomodi about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Athens.\n\nArchaeologists discovered nine burials there this year, finding gold, copper and bone jewelry, pottery and coins dating from the 4th century B.C. to Roman times.\n\n\"The citizens seem to have been remarkably affluent,\" Korka said, adding that the city probably did well out of trade, standing on a key route between the major cities of Corinth and Argos in the northeastern Peloponnese.\n\nSo far, not much was known about Tenea, apart from ancient references to the reputed link with Troy and to its citizens having formed the bulk of the Greek colonists who founded the city of Syracuse in Sicily.\n\nKorka said more should emerge during the excavations, which will continue over coming years.\n\n\"(The city) had distinctive pottery shapes with eastern influences, maintained contacts with both east and west ... and had its own way of thinking, which, to the extent that it could, shaped its own policies,\" she said.\n\nTenea survived the Roman destruction of neighboring Corinth in 146 B.C., and flourished under Roman rule. It appears to have suffered damage during a Gothic invasion in the late 4th century A.D. and may have been abandoned around the time of Slavic incursions two centuries later.", "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was not on the bench Tuesday for a session, after sustaining a fall last week and fracturing three ribs.\n\nThe high court met for a non-argument session Tuesday morning, less than one week after the 85-year-old justice fell in her Supreme Court office.\n\n\u201cJustice Ginsburg will not be on the Bench this morning for the non-argument session,\u201d the Court said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cShe continues to improve and is working from home this morning.\u201d\n\nThe court did not hear arguments on Tuesday, but took the bench for other routine business.\n\nGinsburg, the court\u2019s oldest justice, was admitted to George Washington University Hospital last Thursday \u201cfor observation and treatment\u201d following the fall.\n\nGinsburg has dealt with a series of health concerns in recent years, but has yet to miss a single day of oral arguments in her tenure on the highest court in the land, according to The Washington Post.\n\nGinsburg broke two ribs in 2012, and previously battled two bouts of cancer.

Trump has insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nTo the thousands of Central American migrants making their way toward Mexico's Pacific coast state of Nayarit, the prospect of meeting a hostile reception at the border is nothing new.\n\nAfter a month on the road, through three countries, migrants like Maribel, 22, from La Ceiba, Honduras, are used to tough conditions.\n\nMaribel, who did not want her last name used for fear of reprisals in Honduras, pushed a baby carriage with her 1-year-old daughter while her husband pushed another with their 3-year-old son along a highway leading from Guadalajara to the Nayarit capital of Tepic.\n\n\"We are well aware of everything Trump has been saying,\" said Maribel. \"Let them close whatever they want to close, but we are going to get through anyway.\"\n\nThe thousands of Central American migrants left shelters in Guadalajara early Tuesday and were taken by bus to a highway tollbooth to wait for rides to their next destination.\n\nThey thought other buses would be waiting for them to take them through hurricane-ravaged Nayarit to the neighboring state of Sinaloa, further north.

Foster previously told The Hollywood Reporter that while the Clintons are aware of the project, they themselves are not involved with the series.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t talk about this very often and I still feel uncomfortable talking about it because I think it\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s not as if it didn\u2019t register with me that he was the president,\u201d Lewinsky reflected in the documentary. \u201cObviously it did. But I think in one way, the moment we were in the back office [of the White House] for the first time, the truth is that I think it meant more to me that someone who other people desired had desired me. However wrong it was. However misguided. For who I was at that very moment at 22-years-old, that\u2019s how I felt.\u201d\n\nLewinsky was a 21-year-old recent college graduate from Los Angeles when she began working at the White House as an unpaid intern in July 1995. It didn\u2019t take long for her to have \u201cstrange encounters\u201d with other interns.\n\n\u201cOne in particular [was] this girl gushing over about the president,\u201d she recalled. \u201cTalking about how handsome he was. And I just remember thinking to myself, \u2018Ew! This is an old guy with wiry grey hair. How could she find him attractive?\u2019 I didn\u2019t get it until the first time I was really in his presence.\u201d\n\nLewinsky said her feelings changed when she saw Clinton at an event.\n\n\u201cI was struck in a way that he had this ability to hold everybody that was there,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 Everybody is sort of starry-eyed in his presence. I kind of have to laugh at my younger self. But that was when my crush started.\u201d\n\nLewinsky revealed that between August to October, the pair shared a number of \u201cflirtatious encounters.\u201d However, things escalated in November 1995 during the federal government shutdown. Interns had taken on roles of furloughed federal employees. Lewinsky described that at one point there was a small staff birthday party with Clinton present.\n\n\u201cI realized that the top\u2026 of my underwear had been showing, my thong underwear,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll up the game. I knew he was walking out of a room. And instead of putting my trousers up, like I would have done in any other incidence, I didn\u2019t. It was unnoticeable to everybody else in the room, but he noticed\u2026 I just remember him asking me questions\u2026 Where did I go to college, things like that. I don\u2019t think at that point in my life my heart had ever beat as fast. I blurted out, \u2018You know, I have a crush on you.\u2019 And he laughed and smiled and asked me if I wanted to go to the back office. And I did.\n\n\u201cIt was dark and he eventually asked me if he could kiss me and I said yes. After a little time, I went back to my desk. And at some point later in the evening, I was the only person in the office. And he came back in and he said, \u2018If you want to meet me in the back study in 10 minutes you can.\u2019 So I did. And it became more intimate from there.\u201d\n\nLewinsky claimed Clinton would find excuses to see her and the two would plan on how they could accidentally bump into each other.\n\n\u201cHe had a private personal office,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026 That\u2019s where every intimate encounter took place. The encounters blossomed into a relationship. [But] no monkey business happened inside the Oval Office proper. We would talk and maybe flirt here and there, but no sexual activity happened in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that point, he was in touch or I saw him almost weekly,\u201d Lewinsky added, stressing that not every time she spent with him was sexual.\n\nStill, the relationship appeared to be on Clinton\u2019s terms.\n\n\u201cI had no way to reach him,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he called me, I couldn\u2019t call him back. I was completely at his mercy in that way. But it\u2019s really sad to me when I look back on it. I was this 22-year-old girl working in the White House\u2026 I should have been out on the weekends, meeting people my own age and enjoying myself. And instead, I very often stayed in my office on Saturdays and Sundays, hoping he would call.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lewinsky was shocked when in April 1996, she was transferred from the White House to the Pentagon. This was around the same time Clinton was campaigning for a second term.\n\n\u201cI was distraught,\u201d said Lewinsky. \u201cI thought I would never see Bill again.\u201d\n\nLewinsky felt she also wasn\u2019t the right fit for a role at the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cMy experience with that was I had a military-style jacket,\u201d she joked.\n\nHowever, Lewinsky received phone calls from Clinton during the late hours and promised her she would return to the White House if he won the election.\n\n\u201cHe would say he missed me, he\u2019d wear the neckties I had given him,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the relationship was ongoing, but just in different ways\u2026 I was waiting for the election to be over. Waiting for him to fulfill his promise to bring me back\u2026 For the last two weeks leading up to the election, I didn\u2019t hear from him at all. I had naively invested in his promise\u2026 I felt so deflated and so desperate. And those were the conditions, along with some other things, that led me in confiding to Linda Tripp\u2026 I just broke emotionally.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lewinsky\u2019s insecurities vanished in early 1997 when Clinton gave her a hat pin and Walt Whitman\u2019s \u201cLeaves of Grass\u201d after a taping of his radio show.\n\n\u201cThis was the first time we had been alone since I had been banished to the Pentagon,\u201d said Lewinsky. \u201cAnd so we moved to the bathroom and we were more intimate. There was some attention paid on me and then I was reciprocating where up until that point he had always stopped before completion on his part. I sort of stood up and said I wanted to move past that stage. And he finally said OK. So that finished. And then I hugged him after. And he hugged me. And off I went. I didn\u2019t notice that the dress was soiled\u2026 I went to dinner that night. None of these people said to me, \u2018Hey, you gotta go to the bathroom. You have stuff all over your dress.\u201d\n\nLewinsky admitted that while Clinton at times was warm and affectionate, he also gave her a lot of mixed messages. In May of that same year, he wanted to end the relationship because he was struggling to step outside his marriage and leading a secret life. Lewinsky was also waiting to get a job back at the White House.\n\n\u201cI was really angry,\u201d she admitted. \u201cObviously underneath that anger was the deep hurt.\u201d\n\nIn July, Lewinsky sent Clinton a letter and instead of referring to him as \u201chandsome,\u201d she described her frustrations about working at the Pentagon and how she would ultimately have to tell her parents why she leaving behind a well-paying job.\n\n\u201cI ended up seeing him on July 4th,\u201d said Lewinsky. \u201cHe was angry\u2026 We were in the back study and he started yelling at me, like \u2018It is illegal to threaten the president of the United States of America.\u2019 He was so angry. And I started to cry. I never threatened to go public. I threatened to tell my parents. He immediately softened and he was affectionate\u2026 It was a roller coaster of a relationship [that] led to a slow emotional unraveling on my part.\u201d\n\nThat breakdown would occur in January 1998 when Tripp called the Office of the Independent Counsel and revealed she knew about the affair, offering them taped conversations. The OIC then made Tripp set up a meeting with Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton. There, Lewinsky is ambushed by FBI agents and taken to a hotel room where she is held by waiting prosecutors from the OIC until late in the night.\n\n\u201cI felt so much guilt,\u201d said Lewinsky. \u201cAnd I was terrified. There was a point for me\u2026 where I would be hysterically crying and then I would just shut down. And in the shut-down period, I remember looking out the window and thinking that the only way to fix this was to kill myself... I was scared. I was mortified and afraid of what this was going to do to my family. And I still was in love with Bill at the time. So I felt really responsible.\u201d\n\nLewinsky, who for years kept quiet about the relationship, came forward in February for a Vanity Fair essay in which she described her ordeal as \u201ca living hell,\u201d adding that the experience of being publicly outed and ostracized back them resulted in her being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She now serves as an anti-bullying advocate.\n\n\"The Clinton Affair\" premieres Sunday, November 18 on A&E.", "A trip to a Mexican resort town to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday ended in tragedy Friday when a California man was found stabbed to death in a park near the famed beaches of Playa del Carmen.\n\nTaylor Kristopher Meyer, 27, arrived Wednesday at the popular beach vacation spot with a group of friends, including some members of his fraternity from his years at the University of Colorado.

It recently began selling medication after purchasing online pharmacy PillPack in September for $753 million.\n\nPHYSICAL STORES\n\nAmazon's largest brick-and-mortar push was its nearly $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods last year, giving it about 500 grocery stores.\n\nIt has created its own shops, too. There are 18 Amazon bookstores, five cashier-less convenience stores and three 4-star stores, which sell toys, cookware and other items. There are also dozens of Amazon pop-up shops inside malls and Kohl's department stores where shoppers can touch and try out its gadgets.\n\nIts physical locations had revenue of $13 billion in the first nine months of 2018.\n\nWEB SERVICES\n\nThere's more to Amazon than just shopping. Its Amazon Web Services unit, founded in 2006, provides cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies, and is one of Amazon's fastest growing businesses.\n\nIt had revenue of $17 billion last year, about 10 percent of its total revenue.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nThe ads at the top of Amazon search results are becoming a big business for the company. Amazon doesn't say exactly how much revenue it makes from ads, but an executive said that ad revenue makes up the majority of the \"other revenue\" listed in its financial reports. In its most recent quarter, its \"other revenue\" was $2.5 billion, more than double its revenue in the same period the year before.\n\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\n\nAmazon Prime is a way to cement customer loyalty and get them to spend more on the site. For $119 a year or $12.99 a month, members get free shipping, access to its video streaming service and other perks. The company disclosed for the first time earlier this year that it had more than 100 million paid Prime subscribers worldwide. Revenue from subscriptions topped $9.7 billion last year.\n\nGADGETS\n\nAmazon has been churning out some successful gadgets, including: Kindle tablets, Echo voice-activated speakers and Fire TV video streaming devices. The company doesn't break out revenue for these products.\n\nHOLLYWOOD STUDIO\n\nAmazon produces TV shows for its video streaming service, such as Emmy-winning \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\" and films, such as \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Amazon doesn't break out revenue for its studio.\n\nVIDEO GAMES, AUDIOBOOKS AND MORE\n\nAmazon also owns Twitch, a video streaming service for gamers; Audible, the audiobooks seller; and IMDb.com, an online database of movie and TV show starts, directors and other information. Amazon doesn't break out revenue for these businesses.\n\nAMAZON BRANDS\n\nInstead of relying on famous brands, Amazon has been creating its own. It designs sofas for its Rivet brand, men's shirts for Goodthreads and batteries for AmazonBasics. Amazon has about 130 private label brands, according to TJI Research, which tracks Amazon and its businesses.", "The militant groups under siege by a devastating series of Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip announced Tuesday they've accepted an Egyptian-mediated cease-fire -- just minutes after reports emerged the Jewish State resolved to continue its bombardment \"as necessary.\"\n\nThe terrorist group Hamas and smaller armed groups announced the cease-fire in a joint statement late Tuesday, the Associated Press reported, but its immediate terms were not clear. Israel also has not responded.\n\nMoments before the deal was announced, Israel\u2019s Security Cabinet instructed its military to continue pounding Gaza with airstrikes \u2013 defying warnings of retaliatory attacks from Hamas.\n\nThe declaration Tuesday had come following a six-hour meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Times of Israel. Hamas had been warning that it will carry out more strikes on Israeli cities if the devastating aerial campaign on its territory persists.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military has destroyed a number of Hamas\u2019s buildings in recent days, including a television station that the group is said to have relied upon to broadcast propaganda to its supporters. The Gaza-based militants, in response, have been firing rockets back into Israel, one of which killed a man after striking a structure in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon.\n\nThe spokesman for the Hamas military wing, identified only as Abu Obeida, told the Associated Press on Tuesday the deadly attack on Ashkelon showed the conflict \"has entered the range of fire as a response to the bombing of buildings in Gaza.\"\n\nHe added Ashdod and Beersheba \"are the next targets if the enemy continues bombing civilian buildings.\" School already was canceled Tuesday in large parts of southern Israel and a local election was postponed amid fears of further attacks.\n\nThe violence began late Sunday during a botched covert Israeli raid into Gaza -- and marked the most serious escalation since an Israel-Hamas war in 2014.\n\nUndercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered there, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer dead, according to the Associated Press. Hamas then starting firing missiles into Israel, so far wounding at least 30 people, medical officials say.\n\nThe Israeli military said Tuesday some 400 rockets and mortars have been launched overall from Gaza since Monday afternoon, with about 100 of them intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system.\n\nIsrael has been responding to the rockets with air strikes of its own on the Gaza Strip. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said Israeli forces were focusing on facilities belonging to the two main Gaza militant groups behind the rocket attacks \u2014 Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\n\nIsrael's military says it has hit around 100 targets, as well as several \"key strategic\" Hamas facilities, such as military compounds, rocket launching posts and part of its vast underground tunnel network. Also amongst the targets was the television station and a Gaza City building serving Hamas' military and intelligence forces.\n\n\u201cThe TV channel broadcasts violent propaganda against the State of Israel and its civilians, and provides detail on methods and instructions how to carry out attacks against civilians and IDF soldiers, how to obtain weapons and how to disrupt the IDF's activities to locate terrorists,\u201d the Israeli Defense Forces said in a statement.\n\nGaza's Health Ministry says the airstrikes there have wounded at least 25 people.\n\nOver the past few months, the two sides have come close to a major escalation several times, only to step back in favor of giving Egyptian mediation a chance.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "A popular Cleveland reporter was reportedly found shot to death Monday inside a trailer with her uncle, who she recently reconnected with following her grandmother\u2019s death.\n\nThe bodies of Nikki Delamotte, a 30-year-old culture reporter for Cleveland.com, and her uncle Robert J.

Someone also reached out to Ullman on Facebook and was also concerned about Nikki Delamotte, Cleveland.com reported.\n\nUllman said she went to the trailer and found her daughter\u2019s car with her cell phone and wallet inside. Police soon arrived at the scene and confirmed two bodies were inside the residence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you they\u2019re both dead and they both had gunshot wounds,\u201d she recalled an officer saying.\n\nDelamotte\u2019s colleagues remembered the reporter as the \u201cembodiment of kindness\u201d with \u201ca knack for telling stories that highlighted Cleveland\u2019s diversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had strong positions and backed down from no one, but she did so with gentleness and, always, respect.

You will be missed.\"", "Concerns that North Korea is deceptively surging ahead with its ballistic missile program, according to satellite imagery that appears to show 16 covert bases in development, comes as no surprise to a defector who sees only one real solution to the threat posed by the government of Kim Jong Un.\n\n\u201cNorth Korean regime are liars, and I do not think they are taking part in these relations in a truthful manner. Eventually, we will need a regime change,\u201d said Ji Seong Ho, 36, after speaking at the Oslo Freedom Forum in Taipei, Taiwan last week.\n\n\u201cThere is a mood under this administration in Korea that talking about human rights in North Korea is not right, and the human rights issue for the Korean government is an uncomfortable subject. They are not negotiating \u2013 but it seems the Korean government thinks that peace comes before the human rights of the North Korean people,\u201d Seong Ho said. \u201cWe have tried to appeal this, and we were given a hard time.\u201d\n\nDespite apparent setbacks in dialogue in recent weeks, including the abrupt canceling of another bilateral meeting last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has previously stressed that \u201creal progress\u201d has been made in U.S.-North Korea relations. President Trump has also emphasized his government is \u201cin no rush.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sanctions are on,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThe missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home.\u201d\n\nSeong Ho supports the go-slow approach, and agreed no quick moves should be made. But he did have a particular issue with the South Korean government.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me angry is that, unlike Mr. Trump, who always tries his best to save American people first, the Korean government is not doing the same,\u201d he lamented. \u201cEven though they made several meetings, the Korean government did not bring any Korean hostages back home.\u201d\n\nThe softly spoken, liberal South Korean President has instead opted for a gentler strategy in making amends with Kim Jon Un \u2013 posing for pictures with their hands held, voicing commitments for \u201cpermanent peace,\u201d and avoiding discussions about humanitarian concerns.\n\nTo Seong Ho, the absence of human rights talks is more than a slap in the face.\n\nHe grew up in North Korea during the extreme famine of the 1990s. After the government food rations were halted in 1995, to survive, the young teen would often swipe coal from train cars in exchange for food \u2013 which was rarely more than rats and grass.\n\nBut tragedy struck one day in 1996. Malnourished, exhausted and slowly starving to death, Seong-ho \u2013 whose own grandmother died of starvation \u2013 fainted, fell onto the tracks and was struck by a train.\n\nIn the bloody aftermath, nearby soldiers wrapped his fragile frame in old rags and shuffled him to a barely functioning hospital in a cart. The wailing boy had to have his left hand and foot amputated \u2013 without anesthesia, without anything to dull the horrifying agony.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to describe this horrible situation. No words,\u201d Seong Ho, reflecting on those intensely raw minutes of excruciation. \u201cI was young, and I had this huge fear that if I died I would never be able to see my mother or my father or friends ever again. That was a huge fear in the midst of all this pain. But I found my animal instinct, I knew that I had to do in my mind to get through this horrible situation.\u201d\n\nFrom there, life as a disabled child in an impoverished, closed society only became lonelier, as he was made fend for himself. Four years later, Seong Ho snuck into China to collect food scraps \u2013 but upon returning, was arrested and tortured by North Korean authorities.\n\nThat made up his mind: He couldn't stay.\n\nSix years later, in 2006, Seong-ho finally fled - with just an old pair of wooden crutches - across the Tumen River into China. From there he went into Laos, then Thailand, finally ending up in South Korea.\n\nNow living in Seoul, he is studying law at Dongguk University and serves as president of Now Action and Unity for Human Rights, which endeavors to assist other defectors in resettlement and transmit information.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea is still a huge prison. We don\u2019t have the freedom to move around. Everyone there are victims of slavery, in a normal world people are paid to work. Now they are not, they have no freedom not to work,\u201d Seong Ho said. \u201cPeople are still escaping to China, but even there they often become the subject for human traffickers who exploit them knowing they want to get to South Korea.\u201d\n\nWHY RUSSIA PROPS UP THE DANGEROUS NORTH KOREAN REGIME\n\nHOW MANY DEFECTORS ESCAPE NORTH KOREA AND WHY DON'T WE HEAR MORE FROM THEM?\n\nPresident Trump highlighted Seong Ho's miraculous plight during the State of the Union address this year, calling him an \u201cinspiration to us all,\u201d as the activist triumphantly raised his old crutches in the air.\n\nThe passionate rights advocate says that sudden catapult onto the world stage has been life-changing, and has afforded him protection him from those who now less likely to challenge his strident advocacy.\n\n\u201cWhat Mr. Trump did, gave us a lot of power. The Korean government tried to be unsupportive of the organization and our activities, but now we have given more opportunities to talk about North Korea,\u201d Seong Ho said. \u201cThis was a big moment for human rights, it was a precious moment. I was honored, and others defectors too felt very honored by this.\u201d\n\nThe Washington embassy for the Republic of Korea told Fox News that they are \"fully aware\" of the North Korea nuclear developments and that there is nothing new about them. Furthermore, they explicitly denied that the Seoul government in any way suppresses North Korean human rights organizations, insisting that they \"put strong emphasis on the fundamental humanity and value of human rights and are continually striving to resolve the human rights issue in North Korea.\"\n\nSeong Ho believes the spotlight the Trump administration has put on Pyongyang \u2013 and its refusal to accept the status quo \u2013 has made a dramatic impact.\n\n\u201cThanks to these activities, the regime started to fear what is going on in the international world. The American people have helped us to make our voices heard and they understand justice will win and evil will perish,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we unite against all authoritarian regimes, we have more power to go against these threats.

The Seattle-based company also said that it expects to generate \"incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over the next 20 years as a result of Amazon\u2019s investment and job creation.\"\n\nThe Congress-member elect followed that up with a tweet decrying Amazon's tax incentives for bringing jobs to the area, incentives that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed off on. It's unclear what Ocasio-Cortez meant by Amazon being a \"billion dollar company,\" as the company's market cap is several hundred times that number, at approximately $800 billion. In its most recent quarter, Amazon also generated $56.6 billion in revenue, up 29 percent year over year.\n\nAMAZON IS THE LATEST BIG TECH COMPANY TO FACE EMPLOYEE REVOLT\n\nThe youngest person ever elected to Congress continued her tweetstorm, bemoaning that the jobs being brought and the investment in the community are not going to improve the quality of the life of the residents.\n\nGovernor Cuomo directly addressed these concerns in the Amazon blog post, noting that the average salary for the \"tens of thousands of new jobs Amazon is creating in Queens\" will be $150,000. He also said that the \"economic opportunity and investment will flourish for the entire region.\"\n\nCuomo continued: \"Amazon understands that New York has everything the company needs to continue its growth.

Of this $1.525 billion, up to $1.2 billion could come from a refundable tax credit through New York State\u2019s Excelsior Program and a $325 million cash grant from the Empire State Development fund. The company also said that it will \"separately apply for as-of-right incentives including New York City\u2019s Industrial & Commercial Abatement Program (ICAP) and New York City\u2019s Relocation and Employment Assistance Program (REAP).\"\n\nIn choosing the portion of Queens, which has gone under a tremendous amount of economic redevelopment over the past 20 years, Amazon cited its ability to attract top-tier talent, particularly in software development and related fields. It also mentioned Long Island City's public transportation prowess, noting the community has 8 subway lines, 13 bus lines, a commuter rail, bike-sharing service and ferries, in addition to its close proximity to LaGuardia and JFK airports.\n\nThe Jeff Bezos-led company also mentioned the fact that Long Island City \"is a diverse community with a unique blend of cultural institutions, arts organizations, new and converted housing, restaurants, bars, breweries, waterfront parks, hotels, academic institutions, and small and large tech sector and industrial businesses.\"\n\nIn addition to choosing Long Island for part of its second headquarters, Amazon chose National Landing in Arlington, Virginia, which is less than 3 miles from Washington D.C., placing Amazon near the country's top lawmakers. In Arlington, it too will create \"more than 25,000 full-time high-paying jobs,\" while receiving $573 million in incentives from the Commonwealth of Virginia and a cash grant from Arlington.\n\nAMAZON MET WITH ICE OFFICIALS OVER FACIAL-RECOGNITION SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY IMMIGRANTS\n\nAmazon also announced that it would be opening a new operations center in Nashville, Tenn., where it will receive incentives worth up to $102 million based on the company creating 5,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000 in the city.\n\nThe decision to announce the locations of its HQ2 marks the end of a drama that has played out for more than a year, with the company putting on a competition between U.S. cities, asking for tax incentives and other benefits along the way.

She knows that's not what my mom said.\u201d\n\nBamboo2u further claimed that her beau asked his mom to apologize, but she refused.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I'm more worried she is now going around to his family and saying mean things about my mom,\" the bride said, adding that her mother-in-law is perhaps \"jealous\" of her own mother.\n\n\u201cI'm not sure what to do at this point. I saw my future mother in law the other day and she refused to look at me or even talk to me. But I'm the kind of person who likes to kill you with kindness which seems to drive her crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do from here?\u201d she wondered.\n\nMany commenters expressed sympathy for the woman\u2019s situation, with some offering advice and, in some cases, to keep a \"distant\" relationship with the woman.\n\n\u201cYou can't really do anything about it \u2014 she's not going to change. It wasn't about your mom in the slightest,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cShe gave you valuable information about the kind of person she is. Believe her, and adjust your trust in her accordingly. It's painful to realize that you'll never be able to trust her enough to be close with her, but you can be polite-but-distant, so long as she is polite to your face,\u201d another suggested.\n\n\u201cBe careful and don\u2019t let her try and rugsweep this incident because if you allow her to act like none of this ever happened, she\u2019s going to think she gets s free pass to treat you like crap and push your boundaries to see how much she can get away with,\u201d another said. \u201cAlso be prepared for her to try and ruin your wedding day or something.\u201d\n\nOther Reddit users, meanwhile, insisted that the bride-to-be speak up, and that killing her future mother-in-law with kindness was too weak of an approach.\n\n\u201cKilling with kindness is a polite way to be socially passive aggressive and it solves nothing. In fact, you\u2019re just enabling future bad actions. The truth is, you know who she is now and she can\u2019t hide it,\u201d one user argued. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do or say, she knows she was 'caught.' If she didn\u2019t apologize and try to right things right then and there, she won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour [future mother-in-law] is in the wrong. If she thought the entire day was a s--- show, she should have kept it to herself. She has exposed herself as unauthentic and a malicious gossip. She owes you an apology,\u201d another agreed. \u201cDrop the rope until you receive one. Also, keep all wedding details from her. Don't give her another opportunity to cause conflict and division.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not a fan of killing people with kindness. I'm a fan of treating people the way they treat me,\u201d another simply stated.", "Sandra Bullock donated $100,000 to help save animals from the deadly wildfires scorching California.\n\nHumane Society of Ventura County announced Sunday the Bullock family made the generous donation after their animal rescue efforts during the Hill and Woolsey fires caught their attention.\n\n\u201cThe Humane Society of Ventura County was deeply humbled today [Sunday] by a $100,000 donation from Sandra Bullock and family.

The UN-OPCW team also accused the Islamic State extremist group of using mustard gas twice in 2015 and 2016.\n\nOPCW Director-General Fernando Arias said that a coordinator for the team has already been appointed and more experts and analysts are being hired.\n\n\"We are setting up the team of experts,\" Arias said, calling it a \"small but very powerful team\" with \"high capacities that will be ready to start working in the first weeks of next year.\"\n\nThe organization's member states are meeting next week and must approve its annual budget, which also will cover the new team's work.\n\nArias said he was optimistic about the outcome of financial negotiations, \"and I think that we'll have a budget for the organization.\"\n\nThe team, expected to comprise of about 10 to 12 investigators supported by experts and chemical inspectors who already work at the OPCW, will be able to look back at attacks for which the previous UN-OPCW team did not apportion blame.\n\nOne notorious allegation still being investigated by weapons inspectors is the suspected chemical attack in April in the Syrian town of Douma. An interim report said that weapons inspectors found \"various chlorinated organic chemicals\" at the site of the alleged Douma attack. Arias said that more samples are being studied to reach a final conclusion.\n\nThe OPCW made headlines last month when Dutch authorities revealed that they had foiled an alleged plot by Russian spies to hack into the organization's WiFi network using equipment stashed in the trunk of a rental car parked at a hotel next to the OPCW headquarters.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov rejected the OPCW spying allegation, calling the hacking claim a \"misunderstanding.\"\n\nArias said the alleged plot was not the first attempted hack.\n\n\"We have had attacks since the beginning of this year - cyberattacks,\" he said. \"We take that very seriously.

But Wickremesinghe insisted his firing was unconstitutional. He refused to vacate his official residence and demanded that Parliament be summoned to prove he still has support.\n\nAmid mounting pressure from political opponents and foreign governments, including the United States and the EU, to convene Parliament to end the impasse, Sirisena announced the legislature would return this Wednesday.\n\nBut last Friday, he instead dissolved Parliament and called new elections in January. Opponents said Sirisena made the decision because Rajapaksa had been unable to assemble a majority.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Tuesday to suspend the president's order until Dec. 7 after 13 political parties and individuals filed petitions with the court calling the dissolution unconstitutional. It said it would hold hearings on the case starting Dec. 4.\n\nOpposition supporters welcomed the ruling. Lawmaker Ajith Perera said Parliament will meet as scheduled on Wednesday to prove that Wickremesinghe has the backing of a majority.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister. Sirisena has also accused Wickremesinghe and another Cabinet member of plotting to assassinate him, a charge Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied.\n\nSirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel who were accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war against a Tamil separatist group, which ended in 2009.", "Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed sharply criticized Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday for her handling of an ethnic crisis that led to mass killings and the exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from her country.\n\nMahathir said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi was \"trying to defend the indefensible\" in justifying violence by Myanmar security forces against Rohingya in Rakhine state.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since August 2017.\n\n\"They are actually oppressing these people to the point of, well, killing them, mass killing, and burial in graves dug by the victims and that kind of thing. That may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don't do that kind of thing,\" said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium.\n\nAsked about the issue at a news conference on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore, Mahathir said that as a former political prisoner, Suu Kyi should understand suffering.\n\nIt is unusual for leaders in the 10-nation group to publicly criticize each other.\n\nSuu Kyi became an icon for democracy after spending about 15 years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar's earlier military dictatorship. She and her Buddhist-majority government have been widely criticized for the way they have treated the Muslim Rohingya.\n\nIn Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief said Tuesday that Bangladesh should halt plans to repatriate over 2,200 of the Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, saying such a move would endanger their lives.\n\nMichelle Bachelet's comments are among the strongest yet from a top United Nations official about the planned repatriation this week of some Rohingya.\n\nBachelet's office said it continues to receive reports of rights violations in Rakhine state, \"which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests.\" It said some 130,000 people, including many Rohingya, remain internally displaced in central Rakhine.\n\nOn Monday, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR advised against the returns, saying safety should be assessed first.

It was just the latest case of Trump clashing with Acosta, the White House correspondent for the network Trump regularly derides as a purveyor of \"fake news.\"\n\n\u201cThe wrongful revocation of these credentials violates CNN and Acosta\u2019s First Amendment rights of freedom of the press, and their Fifth Amendment rights to due process,\u201d CNN said in a statement. \u201cWe have asked the court for an immediate restraining order requiring the pass to be returned to Jim, and will seek permanent relief as part of this process.\u201d\n\nCNN added that \u201cthe suit is specific to CNN and Acosta,\u201d but said it could happen to anyone.\n\n\u201cIf left unchallenged, the actions of the White house would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials,\u201d CNN said.\n\nPress Secretary Sanders issued a scathing statement, calling the move \u201cmore grandstanding from CNN\u201d and pointing out that the network has other reporters who are still allowed to enter the White House.\n\n\u201cWe have been advised that CNN has filed a complaint challenging the suspension of Jim Acosta\u2019s hard pass. This is just more grandstanding from CNN, and we will vigorously defend against this lawsuit,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cCNN, who has nearly 50 additional hard pass holders, and Mr. Acosta is no more or less special than any other media outlet or reporter with respect to the First Amendment. After Mr. Acosta asked the President two questions\u2014each of which the President answered\u2014he physically refused to surrender a White House microphone to an intern, so that other reporters might ask their questions. This was not the first time this reporter has inappropriately refused to yield to other reporters.\u201d\n\nSanders continued: \u201cThe White House cannot run an orderly and fair press conference when a reporter acts this way, which is neither appropriate nor professional. The First Amendment is not served when a single reporter, of more than 150 present, attempts to monopolize the floor. If there is no check on this type of behavior it impedes the ability of the President, the White House staff, and members of the media to conduct business.\u201d\n\nLast week, Acosta's press pass to access the White House was suspended \"until further notice\" after he engaged in the contentious back-and-forth over the migrant caravan working its way up through Mexico. Trump characterizes the caravan as \"an invasion,\" a term to which Acosta objected.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think you should let me run the country and you run CNN,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe reporter tried to ask him another question before a female White House aide walked over to him.\n\nTrump then told him, \u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d\n\nAcosta continued to try to talk as the intern was seen trying to take the microphone from his hand. She grabbed the microphone but Acosta wouldn't give it up and there was brief contact between the two. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the suspension of his press credentials stemmed from his \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\" She called the behavior \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nSeveral news outlets accused Sanders of using a \"doctored\" video as evidence, but the press secretary didn\u2019t back down from her decision.\n\n\u201cWe stand by our decision to revoke this individual\u2019s hard pass. We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video,\u201d Sanders tweeted to accompany the allegedly doctored video.\n\nWhite House Counselor Kellyanne Conway has since said the video was simply \u201csped up.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for CNN and Acosta followed up with a separate statement, saying the law is \u201cclear\u201d that the Trump administration violated the First Amendment and Due process Clause.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary revocation of Mr. Acosta\u2019s press credential is causing irreparable injury each and every day because it is stopping him from reporting on news from the White House,\u201d attorney Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. said.\n\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association \u2013 of which Fox News is a member \u2013 issued a statement in support of CNN's decision to take legal action.\n\n\u201cWe continue to urge the Administration to reverse course and fully reinstate CNN\u2019s correspondent,\u201d WHCA President Olivier Knox said. \u201cThe President of the United States should not be in the business of arbitrarily picking the men and women who cover him.\u201d\n\nAcosta has emerged as a hero of the #Resistance after making a habit of shouting and interrupting when Trump and members of his administration are available to the media. He has been praised by people such as comedian Jimmy Kimmel, but is often criticized by Trump supporters.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump kicked the CNN star out of the Oval Office after Acosta badgered the president with racially charged questions. Acosta has also gotten into combative arguments with other members of the administration including former Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney and Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nFox News\u2019 Nicole Darrah contributed to this report.", "Former First Lady Michelle Obama took a jab at President Trump Tuesday when asked who should represent the Democrats in the 2020 presidential election during a sit-down with \u201cGood Morning America\u201d co-host Robin Roberts.\n\n\"I think at this point everybody is qualified and everybody should run,\" Obama said when asked if fellow ex-first lady Hillary Clinton should run again. \u201cI might even tap [17-year-old daughter] Sasha.\u201d\n\nRoberts asked if her comment was directed at Trump, who was a real estate mogul without any political experience before seeking the presidency as the crowd applauded and the two women jokingly blamed each other for bringing up the president.\n\n\"Anybody who feels the passion to get in this race, we need them in there,\u201d Obama said. \"I hope we have a lot of great candidates who get in there and treat each other respectfully.

Martin, the author of the \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d series, was featured in an interview with The Guardian in which he described the ever-growing pressure for him to finish the sixth of seven awaited books in the franchise. The 70-year-old writer updated fans on its progress and mentioned how the story\u2019s TV success has gotten in the way of his ability to finish \u201cWinds of Winter.\n\n\u201cThe show has achieved such popularity around the world, the books have been so popular and so well reviewed, that every time I sit down I\u2019m very conscious I have to do something great, and trying to do something great is a considerable weight to bear,\u201d Martin said. \u201cOn the other hand, once I really get rolling, I get into the world. The rest of the world vanishes, and I don\u2019t care what I\u2019m having for dinner, what movies are on, what my email says or who\u2019s mad at me this week because The Winds of Winter isn\u2019t out \u2013 all that is gone and I\u2019m just living in the world I\u2019m writing about. But it\u2019s sometimes hard to get to that almost trance state.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Martin is notorious for his slow writing pace. The fifth book in the series was released in 2011, shortly after the premiere of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Since then, the writer cannot appear in public without fans and critics alike chastising him for not being at home writing \u201cWinds of Winter.\u201d Further adding to the frustration, Martin\u2019s most recent work has been on \u201cFire and Blood,\u201d a history of the fictional world in which the series is based.\n\nHowever, the author noted that getting into the world of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is not difficult for him, keeping track of its ever-growing nature, on the other hand, is.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been struggling with it for a few years,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cThe Winds of Winter is not so much a novel as a dozen novels, each with a different protagonist, each having a different cast of supporting players, antagonists, allies and lovers around them, and all of these weaving together against the march of time in an extremely complex fashion. So it\u2019s very, very challenging. Fire and Blood by contrast was very simple. Not that it\u2019s easy \u2013 it still took me years to put together \u2013 but it is easier.\u201d\n\nFortunately for eager fans, he confirmed that the next item on his to-do list is \u201cWinds of Winter.\u201d After that, only \u201cA Dream of Spring\u201d stands between him and the completion of one of the most highly sought-after book series ever.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will wrap up the story based on the structure that Martin laid out for series creators David Benioff and D.B.

The Facebook page Muaythai Krobwongjorn, which covers the sport, said he died from a brain hemorrhage. Protective gear is normally not worn in the sport, and video circulated on social media said to be of the fight shows Anucha not wearing any.\n\nChild boxing is widespread in Thailand, especially in rural areas, where it offers a way for children to help provide for their families and a path to lift them out of poverty, according to its advocates. Opponents say the sport is dangerous, citing studies such as one published last month by Thailand's Mahidol University saying that allowing children under 15 to box could result in various types of brain damage.\n\nThai lawmakers are considering legislation proposed last month banning children under 12 from competitive boxing. The legislation has been forwarded to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, which has already drafted a revised version, said Gen. Aduldej Intapong, a member of the National Legislative Assembly.\n\nKickboxing is one of the most popular sports in Thailand and its boosters oppose regulating it.\n\n\"This would have a major impact on the industry,\" Sukrit Parekrithawet, a lawyer who represents several boxing training camps, said of the proposed legislation. \"Those who drafted the law do not know anything about the sport of Thai boxing, and this would make Muay Thai become extinct.\"\n\n\"If you don't allow younger players to learn their way up, how can they be strong and experienced enough to fight?\" he said. \"We call it 'boxing bones.' You need to have boxing bones built from a very young age.\"\n\nSukrit said the death of the 13-year-old, who fought under the name Petchmongkol S. Wilaitong, was a one-off incident and the result of a poorly organized event.\n\n\"This has never happened before and it's unprecedented,\" he said. \"There are several factors involved which have nothing to do with age. The referee wasn't quick enough to stop the fight and the venue didn't have a doctor on standby, which shouldn't happen.\"\n\nPublic television station ThaiPBS reported that Anucha had fought more than 170 matches since he began boxing at the age of 8, and was currently fighting in the under 41 kilogram (under 90 pound) weight division. It said he was raised by his uncle, who is a boxing trainer, after his parents separated.\n\nThe uncle, Damrong Tasako, told Thai PBS that Anucha's death was an accident but he would like to see regulations for children under 15 to wear protective gear to soften blows to the head and body.", "Fans of 23-time Grand Slam champ Serena Williams slammed GQ on social media after the magazine named the tennis great its 2018 Woman of the Year -- but strangely added quotation marks around \"Woman.\"\n\nThe 2018 male honorees -- including Michael B.

An election in one regional council in southern Israel near the Gaza border was postponed because of the incessant rocket fire and the violence could drive down voter turnout in other locations near Gaza.\n\nJerusalem is Israel's poorest city.

The runoff features Moshe Lion, a longtime political fixture backed by much of the country's top leadership, facing off against Ofer Berkovitch, a young secular activist pushing a progressive agenda against religious hard-liners.\n\nLion, a former director general of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office in the 1990s, enjoys the support of key ultra-Orthodox factions and their representatives in government, as well as that of Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman and powerful figures in the ruling Likud party. But he has little grassroots support of his own and failed to place even a single representative in the municipal council.\n\nThe 35-year-old Berkovitch heads a joint group of secular and modern-Orthodox Jews that makes up the largest block of the incoming council. He has also been buoyed by a historic split in the ultra-Orthodox electorate, which did not vote en masse in the first round. Many leading rabbis have refrained from endorsing a final candidate and some Hassidic Jews, whose own hopeful failed to advance to the runoff, have vowed to vote for the secular Berkovitch \u2014 previously a seemingly improbable prospect.\n\nAvishai Cohen, who heads Berkovitch's ultra-Orthodox branch, says it's the result of vast changes in the community, with a younger generation more open to change and less reliant on the stringent all-encompassing edicts of rabbinical authorities. With many now joining the military and the modern workforce in growing numbers, he said it was natural they would also break out of their traditional voting patterns.\n\n\"There is a groundswell toward real leadership,\" Cohen said at a makeshift campaign office where he tried to convince fellow ultra-Orthodox to vote for his candidate. \"I'm here to show that there is another kind of ultra-Orthodox Jew.\"\n\nFew Palestinians vote since most consider participation as recognition of Israeli control over east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. So the result will likely come down to ultra-Orthodox turnout and how many flip to Berkovitch's side.\n\nEither way, the winner is going to have to deal with deep divisions in the city after a hotly contested campaign.\n\n\"The number one challenge is of course the diversity of the city. Jerusalem has a very unique demographic structure, therefore every mayor who is elected will have to find a way to embrace the other side,\" said Lior Schillat, the director general of the Jerusalem Institute for Policy Research, a non-partisan think-tank.\n\nElsewhere in Israel, runoffs will take place in Rishon Lezion, the country's fourth largest city, and several other major cities.\n\n____\n\nFollow Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap", "Pope Francis is giving a prominent new role to the Vatican's most trusted sex crimes investigator in a sign that he's looking to improve the Holy See's response to abuse at a time when the church and papacy are facing a credibility crisis.\n\nFrancis on Tuesday named Archbishop Charles Scicluna as a deputy, or adjunct secretary, at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office that processes sex abuse cases globally.\n\nScicluna had been the congregation's chief prosecutor for a decade and was credited with measures making it easier to defrock pedophiles. But Pope Benedict XVI sent him to his native Malta in 2012 as bishop after Scicluna's tough line ruffled too many feathers in the Vatican.\n\nScicluna's new appointment is symbolically significant and will also give him greater say in the day-to-day running of the congregation, even though he retains his post in Malta.\n\nFrancis clearly trusts him after he asked Scicluna to conduct an in-depth investigation in Chile earlier this year that revealed Francis' gross misunderstanding of an abuse and cover-up scandal there.\n\nScicluna's return comes as Francis and the church at large are under fire again for the way the Vatican and religious superiors around the globe turned a blind eye to priests who raped and molested children.\n\nThe crisis is particularly acute in the U.S., where prosecutors in more than a dozen states have announced investigations into abuse and cover-up following the revelations of the Pennsylvania grand jury report.\n\nIn addition, U.S. bishops are reeling from allegations that one of their own, ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, preyed on seminarians and at least two minors, and that his misconduct with adults was an open secret in the U.S. and Vatican.\n\nFrancis' record on abuse has long been uneven, and his papacy has been rocked by claims by a Vatican archbishop that he rehabilitated McCarrick in 2013 from sanctions imposed by Benedict.\n\nFrancis' credibility took another hit this week when the Vatican blocked U.S. bishops from voting on a new code of conduct and a commission involving lay experts to review complaints against brother bishops.", "An Egyptian court has sentenced a policeman to three years in prison and another to six months over the killing of a detainee in custody, relatively light sentences that prompted a backlash on social media.\n\nThe Cairo Criminal Court convicted the two of beating Mohamed Abdel-Hakim to death in a police station in Cairo's Mokattam neighborhood in January.

The sanctions, he said, \"will not affect the relations between the two countries.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with world powers in May. United Nations monitors say Iran still abides by the deal, in which it agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in return for the lifting of international sanctions.\n\nSince then, Trump announced what he billed the \"toughest ever\" sanctions regime against Iran and the country has seen its oil exports crash and its currency lose more than half its value. The full brunt of the measures came into effect Nov. 5 when the U.S. re-imposed oil and banking sanctions.\n\nHowever, other major economies including Europe, Russia and China have refused to take parallel measures, and Iran can still do business with the outside world.\n\nIraq is Iran's second largest export market. Since 2003, when the U.S. invasion plunged the country into civil war, Iraq has depended on Iran for everything from food to machinery, to electricity and natural gas.\n\nMasjedi boasted that trade between the two countries was on track to reach $8.5 billion this year and said Iran's outlook is to reach $22 billion annually -- more than triple its $7 billion in volume in 2017. He did not give specifics.\n\nNon-American companies are free to do business with Iran, so long as they do not also do business with the U.S., or through U.S. financial institutions.\n\n\"We will not tie ourselves to the dollar,\" said Masjedi.\n\nMore than 60 Iranian companies are represented at the Baghdad fair, which runs until Nov. 19.\n\nMir Zad, director of Hisam, which sells generators and other electrical equipment, said he was aiming to secure deals worth around $1 million at the fair. He wasn't concerned about the new restrictions on the dollar; deals could be made in Iraqi dinar, he said.\n\nStill, a substantial portion of trade between the two nations is done in energy and cannot easily be structured outside the new sanctions regime.\n\nIt puts Iraq in a delicate position as a partner of both Washington and Tehran.\n\nWith its electricity sector in tatters, Iraq depends on Iranian gas and power generation to power its economy. A temporary electricity reduction last summer fueled unrest in Iraq's southern provinces.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Baghdad last Thursday announced it was granting Iraq a 45-day waiver to allow it to continue to purchase gas and electricity in Iraq.\n\nIt said the exception would give Iraq time to \"take steps toward energy independence.\"\n\nBut it could take a year or longer to secure enough new power to make up for lost imports, said economist Bassim Jameel Antwan.\n\nIn the meantime, Iraq may have little choice but to continue to import from Iran. And Iran's deep entanglement in Iraq's political and military affairs further complicates the picture.\n\nIran has the ear of several of Iraq's top politicians and trains, finances and advises some of the largest militias in the country. While it is precisely this sort of influence the U.S. is aiming to curb, Iran can still play the role of spoiler in Iraqi politics.\n\n\"You plan for one thing, and the result might be something else,\" said Antwan.\n\nSince May, Iran's currency the rial has sank in the black market from 60,000 to 140,000 to the dollar.

Just last week, Republicans Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis defeated Democrats Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum in the Senate and gubernatorial races there. The results seemed to be conclusive at the time. -- They were reported on this, and every other news channel, on Election night.\n\nYet just 6 days later, it\u2019s very possible that both those Democrats will win those seats, the ones that just the other day they had lost. How did that happen, exactly?\n\nThousands of new and uncounted ballots appeared in Florida, mostly in Democratic-leaning counties, and changed the results sufficiently to trigger a statewide recount.\n\nThe recount is underway now, and the process is not inspiring confidence in the system.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to find yourself thinking this way if you believe politics is a holy war.\n\nPresident Trump has complained about it, as have plenty of other people, including some journalists and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. But it turns out that\u2019s not allowed.\n\nTo restate the rules, in case you've forgotten: When a Republican wins an election, it\u2019s fine to question the legitimacy of the process. Democrats have been doing since the days Trump was elected two years ago. That\u2019s patriotic. It's your duty. But when the Democratic Party\u2019s power is at stake, raising questions about the process is wrong. Indeed it\u2019s nothing less than the road to dictatorship.\n\n\"[Trump is] basically trying to undermine at every turn. It\u2019s not just Florida,\" former Bill Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart said recently on CNN. \"He weighed in on Arizona. He weighed in on other races. He\u2019s undermining the legitimacy of elections where he doesn\u2019t like the results. And that is a hallmark of a failing democracy\u2026of someone moving toward authoritarianism.\"\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s authoritarian,\u201d scream the authoritarians. Meanwhile, defending the results of elections that have already been called is now the same as overturning elections.\n\nNancy Pelosi, likely the next Speaker of the House, explained it on CBS's \u201cFace the Nation\" when asked by host Margaret Brennan what is happening in Broward County, Fla.\n\n\"My experience with the president is any time charges somebody with something, he\u2019s just projecting what he might have done himself,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"Election fraud?\" Brennan prodded.\n\n\"Well, obstruction, suppression of the vote,\" Pelosi replied.\n\n\u201cSuppression.\u201d Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t use the word accidentally. The term is meant to evoke images of a darker time in American history, a time of night riders and burning crosses, a time very few living Americans remember personally but that lives in our collective memory.\n\nThis kind of talk can be politically useful. That\u2019s why they do it, that's why it\u2019s a theme on the left, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\n\nIn Broward County, for example, ballot counting is overseen by a woman named Brenda Snipes. Snipes was previously caught illegally destroying ballots. This time around she\u2019s apparently mixed invalid provisional ballots with valid ones. That sounds bad. But don\u2019t you dare criticize Snipes for the way she does her job. According to MSNBC, the only relevant fact about Brenda Snipes is the color of her skin. Here\u2019s this recent moment from the cable network:\n\n\"Here is the way they are treating Brenda Snipes, who is the long-time Election Supervisor there, who by the way is an older black woman in the Deep South,\" said MSNBC's Joy Reid as she introduced video of protesters chanting \u201clock her up\u201d at Broward County elections headquarters and President Trump simply stating, \"If you look at the person, in this case, a woman, she has had a horrible history.\"\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering what demagoguery looks like, you just had an example it.\n\nBut why now? Democrats are acting like they\u2019ve somehow been robbed of power.\n\nYet, in elections just last week, Democrats gained power. They retook the House of Representatives after eight years. They added several governorships. They nearly broke even in the Senate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough. They want more. And they\u2019ll use any means necessary.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, the county canvassing board disqualified a vote because it was cast by a non-citizen. Non-citizens aren\u2019t allowed to vote in federal elections. It\u2019s illegal.\n\nIt also never happens in this country. Ever! We\u2019re told that again and again, and anyone who disagrees is racist. But in this case, it actually did happen. Nobody disputes that.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 response: Attorneys for Gillum and Nelson said the vote shouldn\u2019t be disqualified. They objected to the disqualification. Because the only thing that matters to them is winning.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to find yourself thinking this way if you believe politics is a holy war.\n\nTo a religious extremist, an election isn\u2019t a contest between fellow Americans who disagree on policies. It\u2019s an existential battle between good and evil. Evil must be vanquished, at all costs, no matter what.\n\nNew York Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has reached this conclusion. Gillibrand isn\u2019t an obvious candidate for America\u2019s leading moral voice. -- She was a longtime friend and defender of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s, for example. But listen to her now, preaching like it\u2019s the last Sunday in Lent. She is so upset, that she told \u201cThe View\u201d she just might have to run for president.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been thinking about it because, as we said earlier, what President Trump has been putting into this country is so disturbing, so divisive, so dark, that I believe that I\u2019ve been that I've been called to fight as hard as I possibly can to restore that moral integrity, that moral decency,\" Gillibrand said. \"So I\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d\n\nMoral Integrity.

But the way scientists define the exact mass of a kilogram is about to change.\n\nUntil now, its mass has been defined by the granddaddy of all kilos: a golf ball-sized metal cylinder locked in a vault in France. For more than a century, it has been the one true kilogram upon which all others were based.\n\nNo longer.\n\nGathering in Versailles, west of Paris, governments are expected on Friday to approve plans to instead use a scientific formulation to define the exact mass of a kilo. The change is expected to have practical applications in industries and sciences that require ultra-precise measurements of mass.\n\nAnd it will mean redundancy for the so-called Grand K, the kilo that has towered above them all since 1889.\n\nMade of a corrosion-resistant alloy of 90 percent platinum and 10 percent iridium , the international prototype kilo has rarely seen the light of day. Yet its role has been crucial, as the foundation for the globally accepted system for measuring mass upon which things like international trade depend.\n\nThree different keys, kept in separate locations, are required to unlock the vault where the Grand K and six official copies \u2014 collectively known as \"the heir and the spares\" \u2014 are entombed together under glass bell-jars at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, in Sevres on the western outskirts of Paris.\n\nFounded by 17 nations in 1875 and known by its French initials, the BIPM is the guardian of the seven main units humanity uses to measure its world : the meter for length, the kilogram for mass, the second for time, the ampere for electric current, the kelvin for temperature, the mole for the amount of a substance and the candela for luminous intensity.\n\nOf the seven, the kilo is the last still based on a physical artefact, the Grand K. The meter, for example, used to be a meter-long metal bar but is now defined as the length that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second.\n\n\"This, if you like, is a moment of celebration because it's like the last standard remaining from 1875 that will finally be replaced by new innovation,\" Martin Milton, the BIPM director, said in an Associated Press interview. \"Everything else has been recycled and replaced and improved. This is the last improvement that dates back to the original conception in 1875. So that's a tribute to what was done in 1875, that it's lasted this long.\"\n\nOnly exceedingly rarely, and exceedingly carefully, have the BIPM's master kilos been gingerly taken out so that other kilos sent back to Sevres from around the world could be compared against them, to be sure they were still properly calibrated, give or take the mass of a dust particle or two.\n\nAlthough many Americans commonly think of weight in pounds and ounces, the United States is officially a kilo country, too: It was one of the original 17 founders of the BIPM in 1875. The United States' primary kilo is called K20 and was assigned to the country in 1889 by the BIPM, along with another, K4. One kilo is equivalent to 2.2 pounds.\n\nThe U.S. also has six other platinum-iridium kilos: K79, 85, 92, 102, 104 and 105. They are all looked after by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nTo verify their mass, K20 and other kilos from around three dozen other countries were measured in Sevres against the BIPM's master kilos in a painstaking calibration exercise from 1988 to 1992. K20 was most recently then measured again at the BIPM in 2014.\n\nEven as humans argued, fought and slaughtered each other by the tens of millions in the 20th century, they shared the kilo. The kilo allocated to China in 1983, as it started to embrace market reforms that subsequently turned it into an economic behemoth, was the first manufactured with ultra-high precision diamond machining. Allocated to Japan in 1894, K39 was later ceded to South Korea in 1958.\n\nThe kilo is \"a tribute to man's ability to collaborate,\" Milton says. \"It's been called a great work of peace, actually, because it's one of the areas where all of the states of the world come together with absolutely the same objective.\"\n\nThe metal kilo is being replaced by a definition based on Planck's constant, which is part of one of the most celebrated equations in physics but also devilishly difficult to explain . Suffice to say that the update should, in time, spare nations the need to occasionally send their kilos back to Sevres for calibration against the Grand K. Scientists instead should be able to accurately calculate an exact kilo, without having to measure one precious lump of metal against another.\n\nMilton says the change will have applications in computing, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, the study of climate change and other sciences where precise measurements are required.\n\n\"The system will be intrinsically correct by reference to the laws of science, the laws of nature,\" he said. \"We won't have to depend on just assuming that one particular object never changes.\"", "Rep.

The recording was shared last month with CIA Director Gina Haspel during a trip to Turkey\u2019s capital, however, she was not allowed to bring the intelligence back to the states, the report said.\n\nWhile some intelligence officials view the recording as strong evidence in tying Prince Mohammed to Khashoggi\u2019s death, the Times noted that Turkish officials have said it does not definitively incriminate the crown prince, echoing similar sentiments made by other government officials, including American intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, the crown prince was not identified by name in the recording and intelligence officials are not completely certain that Mutreb was referencing him in the call, the Times reported.\n\nThe Royal Kingdom refuted the idea that Prince Mohammed \u201chad any knowledge whatsoever\u201d of Khashoggi\u2019s killing, telling the Times in a statement on Monday that Turkey shared the recordings with Saudi intelligence \u201cand at no moment was there any reference to the mentioned phrase in the such recordings,\u201d referring to the \u201ctell your boss\u201d comment made by Mutreb.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday became the first Western leader to acknowledge his country had heard recordings of the killing of Khashoggi, saying his country \u201chas been fully briefed up on what Turkey had to share.\u201d\n\nHis comments come just a few days after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had given recordings \"to Saudi Arabia, to America, to the Germans, the French, to the British, to all of them.\u201d\n\nTrudeau, who thanked Erdogan in person for \"his strength in responding to the Khashoggi situation\" when the two leaders met in Paris this weekend, said that he personally had not heard the shared audio -- which is the latest move by Turkey to maintain international pressure on Saudi Arabia to prevent a cover-up of the Oct. 2 killing.\n\nHe declined to give any details on the contents of the tapes.\n\nOn Sunday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke with the Saudi crown prince on the telephone and \"emphasized that the United States will hold all of those involved in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi accountable and that Saudi Arabia must do the same.\"\n\nThe crown prince is widely suspected of at least having knowledge of the killing, which involved some members of his security entourage.\n\nFox News\u2019 Frank Miles and Andrew O\u2019Reilly contributed to this report.", "I'm Chad Pergram with the Speaker's Lobby.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is the odds on favorite to return to the Speakership next year, but it's unclear how she gets there. In fact, it may be the people who are on the record opposing Pelosi who may help her win. Here's why:\n\nIt takes a simple majority of all members voting in the House to become Speaker. If everyone votes, that means she needs 218. However, there are a number of current Democrats and Representatives-elect who oppose Pelosi. And that could drop Pelosi below that 218 vote threshold. That is, unless, those members don't vote are absent or vote \"present.\" Members who don't vote don't count against the total.\n\nFormer Democratic Idaho Congressman Walt Minnick was an upset winner in 2008..in a district which heavily favored Republicans. Minnick told Pelosi he wanted to vote present..because she was toxic in Idaho. Minnick said Pelosi persuaded him to vote yes and it hurt him in 2010.\n\nMinnick lost.

At least 25 people have been wounded.\n\nIsraeli medical officials said a 48-year-old man was found early Tuesday under the rubble of a building hit by a rocket in the southern city of Ashkelon. Relatives in the West Bank town of Halhoul identified the man as Mahmoud Abu Usbeh, a Palestinian laborer who had been working in Israel. He left a wife and six children behind.\n\n\"Everyone in town is sad. It's God's will and there nothing we can do about it,\" said his cousin, Jihad Abu Usbeh.\n\nAt least 20 people have also been wounded in Israel, three critically, according to medical officials.\n\nThe military said jets struck several \"key strategic\" Hamas targets, including military compounds, rocket launching posts and part of its vast underground tunnel network. Also targeted was a Gaza City building serving Hamas' military and intelligence forces that houses a munition warehouse.\n\nThe armed wing of Hamas threatened to step up its attacks and fire rockets further north toward the Israeli cities of Ashdod and Beersheba if Israel continued its airstrikes.\n\nThe spokesman for the Hamas military wing, identified only as Abu Obeida, said the deadly attack on the coastal city of Ashkelon showed the city \"has entered the range of fire as a response to the bombing of buildings in Gaza.\" He said Ashdod and Beersheba \"are the next targets if the enemy continues bombing civilian buildings.\"\n\nSchool has been cancelled in large parts of southern Israel and a local election has been postponed because of the threat of further attacks.\n\nOver the past few months, the sides have come close to a major escalation several times, only to step back in favor of giving a chance to a long-term Egyptian mediated truce.\n\nHowever, the current level of escalation and angry rhetoric, including Hamas' warnings to strike deeper inside Israel, might make it more difficult to restore calm.\n\nThe Israeli security Cabinet began meeting to discuss the next steps, as the United Nations appealed for calm and said it was trying to broker a cease-fire.\n\nThe eruption of fighting cast doubt over recent understandings brokered by Egypt and U.N. officials to reduce tensions. Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had defended those understandings, saying he was doing everything possible to avoid another war. But he will now be under intense pressure to retaliate, given Hamas' unrelenting rocket barrages.\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer dead. Hamas then fired a guided missile that struck a bus from which soldiers had just disembarked, an upgrade over its typical inaccurate projectiles.\n\nThe strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area. A 19-year-old soldier was critically wounded and rocket attacks and Israeli retaliation fire quickly ensued.\n\nThe airstrikes and rocket barrages resumed at dawn Tuesday after nearly two hours of calm.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said Israeli warplanes, tanks and naval vessels were involved in strikes against military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities belonging to the two main Gaza militant groups behind the attacks \u2014 Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.\n\nHe said the Israeli military has enhanced its deployment along the border but had yet to mobilize its reserves. He said Gaza militant groups were believed to have an arsenal in excess of 20,000 rockets and mortars of different caliber and range.\n\nIn Gaza, schools and public institutions were closed as people ventured outside to inspect the damage after a long night of aerial raids. Near the destroyed TV station, residents salvaged papers and belongings from their damaged houses. Debris was strewn across the streets and shattered window glass crunched under people's feet.\n\nIn Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, a six-story residential building that also housed a kindergarten on its ground floor was destroyed.\n\n\"All the people here are civilians, children and families. We took our children and fled from here. When we returned, we found great destruction,\" said Mamdouh al-Shurafa, a resident of the building. \"When we are bombed in the middle of the city, where we can go?\"\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover, a blockade that has devastated Gaza's economy.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers.

The rocket was fired after an Israeli airstrike destroyed Hamas' TV building in Gaza.\n\nThe spokesman for the Hamas military wing, identified only as Abu Obeida, said in a statement that Ashkelon \"has entered the range of fire as a response to the bombing of buildings in Gaza.\"\n\nHe says that Ashdod and Beersheba \"are the next targets if the enemy continues bombing civilian buildings.\"\n\nOf the three cities, Ashkelon is closest to Gaza.\n\n___\n\n8 a.m.\n\nIsraeli medical services say a man has been killed by a rocket that hit an apartment building in southern Israel and a woman was critically wounded.\n\nMagen David Adom says the two were trapped in an apartment in Ashkelon that was struck by a rocket from Gaza early on Tuesday.

Another pilot said the speed was \u201castronomical, it was like Mach 2,\u201d which is twice the speed of sound, the report said.\n\nAnother pilot in a Virgin plane theorized that the lights could have been a meteor or another object re-entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere. He also observed \u201ctwo bright lights\u201d to his right which \u201cclimbed away at speed,\u201d the BBC reported.\n\n\u201cGlad it wasn\u2019t just me,\u201d another pilot said, according to The Irish Times.\n\nThe Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) is investigating the reports.\n\n\"Following reports from a small number of aircraft on Friday 9th November of unusual air activity the IAA has filed a report,\" the IAA explained, in a statement emailed to Fox News. \"This report will be investigated under the normal confidential occurrence investigation process.\"\n\nA spokesman for the IAA told The Irish Times that the UFOs were unlikely to be aliens from another planet.\n\nShannon Airport declined to comment when contacted by Fox News. \"As the incident is under investigation by the IAA it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for us to comment,\" said a spokeswoman, in an emailed statement.\n\nFox News' James Rogers contributed to this article.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nTurkey is waiting for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to shed light on the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last month, the country's president was quoted as saying Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on board his plane while returning from World War I commemorations in Paris, Recep Tayyip Erdogan also reportedly said audio recordings of the killing that Turkey shared with officials from Saudi Arabia and other nations were so \"atrocious\" that a Saudi intelligence official speculated that the killer may have been on heroin.\n\n\"The recording is truly atrocious. In fact, when the Saudi intelligence officer listened to the recording he was so shocked that he said 'this one probably took heroin. Only someone who took heroin would do it,'\" Erdogan was reported as saying in comments published in pro-government Yeni Safak.\n\nTurkey says The Washington Post columnist, who had criticized the crown prince, was killed by a 15-member assassination squad sent from Riyadh. Ankara insists the orders for the killing came from the highest levels of the Saudi government, but not King Salman.\n\nThe crown prince has come under scrutiny for having knowledge of the killing, which involved some members of his security entourage.\n\nPressing ahead with moves to maintain pressure on Saudi Arabia, Erdogan said the crown prince had told Turkish envoys that he would shed light on the Oct. 2 killing at the kingdom's consulate and do what was \"necessary.\"\n\n\"He said this to my special envoys,\" Erdogan was quoted as saying. \"We are waiting patiently.\"\n\nErdogan repeated that Turkey had shared audio recordings relating to the killing with Saudi Arabia and other nations, including the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Canada.\n\nUnder mounting pressure, Saudi Arabia has changed its narrative about Khashoggi's killing. It first said he walked out of the embassy the day he disappeared before eventually acknowledging Khashoggi died inside the consulate. Saudi Arabia has also recently acknowledged Turkish evidence that showed the slaying was premeditated.\n\nTurkey says a 15-member Saudi \"hit squad\" strangled and dismembered Khashoggi at the consulate. Media reports have suggested that his body could have been chemically dissolved as it has not yet been found.\n\nSaudi officials characterize the killing as a rogue operation carried out by Saudi agents who exceeded their authority.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nGaza militants fired dozens of rockets at southern Israel early on Tuesday, killing a man in a strike on a residential building, and warning they would escalate their attacks if Israel continues bombing targets in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe cross-border attacks, which were triggered by a botched Israeli undercover raid into Hamas-ruled Gaza over the weekend, marked the most serious escalation since an Israel-Hamas war in 2014.\n\nInternational mediators appealed for restraint, hoping to avert another war.\n\nThe Israeli military said some 400 rockets and mortars been launched from Gaza since the current round began on Monday afternoon, with about 100 of them intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defense system.\n\nIsrael has hit more than 100 targets it says are linked to militants in Gaza, including a strike that destroyed the TV station of Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza. Palestinian officials say at least three people, including two militants, have been killed. In Israel, at least 20 people have been wounded, several seriously.\n\nThe armed wing of Hamas threatened to step up its attacks and fire rockets further north toward the Israeli cities of Ashdod and Beersheba if Israel continued its airstrikes.\n\nThe spokesman for the Hamas military wing, identified only as Abu Obeida, said the deadly attack on the coastal city of Ashkelon showed the city \"has entered the range of fire as a response to the bombing of buildings in Gaza.\" He said Ashdod and Beersheba \"are the next targets if the enemy continues bombing civilian buildings.\"\n\nSchool has been cancelled in large parts of southern Israel and local election postponed because of the threat of further attacks.\n\nOver the past few months, the sides have come close to a major escalation several times, only to step back in favor of giving a chance to a long-term Egyptian mediated truce.\n\nHowever, the current level of escalation and angry rhetoric, including Hamas' warnings to strike deeper inside Israel, might make it more difficult to restore calm.\n\nIn Jerusalem, the Israeli security Cabinet began meeting to discuss the next steps, as the United Nations appealed for calm.\n\nThe deadly rocket strike came before dawn in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. The Magen David Adom medical service said a man in his 40s was found dead under the rubble of a building in Ashkelon.\n\nHe was the first casualty in Israel from the current wave. The man was later identified as a man from Hebron, the West Bank's largest Palestinian city.\n\nThe eruption of fighting cast doubt over recent understandings brokered by Egypt and U.N. officials to reduce tensions. Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had defended those understandings, saying he was doing everything possible to avoid another war. But he will now be under intense pressure to retaliate given Hamas' unrelenting rocket barrages.\n\nThe rocket fire was triggered by a botched Israeli military raid in Gaza on Sunday. Undercover troops, apparently on a reconnaissance mission, were discovered inside Gaza, setting off a battle that left seven militants, including a Hamas commander, and a senior Israeli military officer dead. Hamas then fired a guided missile that struck a bus from which soldiers had just disembarked, marking an upgrade over its typical inaccurate projectiles.\n\nThe strike set the bus on fire, sending a large plume of black smoke over the area. A 19-year-old soldier was critically wounded and rocket attacks and Israeli retaliation fire quickly ensued.\n\nThe airstrikes and rocket barrages resumed at dawn Tuesday after nearly two hours of calm.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said Israeli warplanes, tanks and naval vessels were involved in strikes against military compounds, observation posts and weapons facilities belonging to the two main Gaza militant groups behind the attacks \u2014 Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.\n\nHe said the Israeli military has enhanced its deployment along the border but had yet to mobilize its reserves. He said Gaza militant groups were believed to have an arsenal in excess of 20,000 rockets and mortars of different caliber and range.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized control of Gaza from the internationally-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. In the most recent war, over 2,200 Palestinians were killed, more than half of them civilians, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Seventy-three people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael and Egypt have maintained a blockade on Gaza since the Hamas takeover. The blockade has devastated Gaza's economy.\n\nIn recent weeks, Egyptian and U.N. mediators had appeared to make progress in brokering informal understandings aimed at quieting the situation.\n\nLast week, Israel allowed Qatar to deliver $15 million to Gaza to allow cash-strapped Hamas to pay the salaries of thousands of government workers. At the same time, Hamas has lowered the intensity of its border protests in recent weeks.\n\nNetanyahu cut short a visit to Paris because of the flare-up and returned to Israel on Monday for consultations with top security officials.\n\n____\n\nAkram reported from Gaza City, Gaza Strip.", "A Japanese woman was arrested in connection to the death of a U.S. airman last week, who was fatally stabbed while at his off-base residence in Western Tokyo, the Air Force said in a statement.\n\nAria Saito, 27, was arrested by Japanese police on suspicion of attempted murder after Master Sgt. Nicholas Vollweiler, 35, from the 374th Airlift Wing was found with stab wounds on Friday. He later died at a hospital, according to the statement.\n\nPolice are expected to upgrade the charges, Stars and Stripes reported.\n\nJapanese media said Saito allegedly told authorities that she killed Vollweiler because she did not want to end their relationship and that she \u201cstabbed a man I was dating with a knife, aiming at his right neck,\u201d Japanese broadcaster TBS reported according to Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe 27-year-old also said she planned to kill herself afterward, Japanese media reported.\n\n\u201cMaster Sgt.

WSBTV.com reported that the judge\u2019s 56-page ruling could affect thousands of provisional ballots. Groh-Wargo called the ruling \"good news.\"\n\nBrian Kemp, her Republican challenger, issued a statement a day earlier calling for Abrams to concede. Kemp has declared victory and said it is \"mathematically impossible\" for her campaign to force a runoff.\n\nAbrams' campaign did not immediately respond to a phone call from Fox News late Monday night.\n\nAbrams, 44, a Democrat, has maintained that she will not concede until every vote has been counted, and pointed to the 5,000 votes tallied over the weekend that favored her.\n\nTotenberg, who was appointed by President Obama, ruled in connection to Common Cause's lawsuit filed on Nov. 5. Totenberg's order doesn't change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify their results.\n\nCommon Cause, a nonpartisan group, claimed in the suit that Kemp, while secretary of state, failed to maintain \"the security of voter information despite known vulnerabilities\" leading up to the midterm. The suit blasted the state's \"provisional ballot scheme,\" that could disenfranchise a registered voter at the ballot box.\n\nThe suit pointed out cases where voters were turned around after computer glitches and cases where voters were not offered provisional ballots. One man voted for decades and was \u201cdisturbed\u201d to learn his registration history was erased.\n\nThe court ruled that the secretary of state\u2019s office must establish a hotline and publicize it on its website for voters to see if their provisional ballots were counted. Totenberg also ruled that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5 p.m., which falls before the Nov. 20 deadline set by state law.\n\n\"I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it. I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count,\" Abrams said in a statement explaining her refusal to end her bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history.\n\nA total of 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the state during the midterm, 12,151 were cast in 2014. Four Democratic-leaning counties with the largest number of provisional ballots -- Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett \u2013 \u201chad not yet reported their numbers to the secretary as of November 11,\u201d the suit said.\n\nThe lawsuit also asked that provisional ballots cast by a voter registered in another county be counted as if the voter had shown up at the wrong precinct. The lawsuit says that of the 1,556 provisional ballots Fulton County reported having rejected by Nov. 9, nearly 1,000 were disqualified because they were cast by voters whose registration records showed them registered in another county.\n\nEdgardo Cortes, who currently works as an election security adviser at New York University, said these uncounted provisional ballots could sway the election and, despite Kemp\u2019s claims, his unofficial vote total is so close to 50 percent, a runoff is possible.\n\nKemp was up 50.2 percent to Abrams' 48.7 percent early Tuesday. More than 3.9 million votes were cast in the election, and Abrams would need to acquire more than 20,000 additional votes to force a runoff.\n\nAbrams' campaign filed a lawsuit Sunday asking a federal court to push the deadline for counties to certify their results to Wednesday, while also requiring that elections authorities count certain provisional and absentee ballots that have been or would be rejected for \"arbitrary reasons.\"\n\n\u201cThis ruling is a victory for the voters of Georgia because we are all stronger when every eligible voter is allowed to participate in our elections,\u201d Sara Henderson, executive director for Common Cause Georgia, which filed the lawsuit, told AJC.com.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "Two men who led different military coups in Fiji are battling for control of the island nation in a general election on Wednesday.\n\nOpinion polls indicate Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama is poised to win a second term after he first held democratic elections in 2014, eight years after he seized power in a coup.\n\nHis main opponent is Sitiveni Rabuka, who led two military coups in the 1980s before serving for seven years as prime minister. Just this week, a judge cleared Rabuka of an electoral disclosure violation in a case many viewed as being politically motivated.\n\nFiji has not allowed the political tensions to affect its vital tourism industry, which promotes the Pacific nation's pristine, sunny beaches and friendly, welcoming people.\n\nGiven the history of coups, political stability has been a big issue leading up to the election, as have racial tensions and economic issues.\n\n\"Bainimarama does look set to secure his second victory at the polls and has already led the country for 13 years through a period of relative stability,\" said Jonathan Pryke, the director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank.\n\nMany people in the nation of 920,000 seem appreciative of the economic gains they've made under Bainimarama.\n\n\"There are no school fees. Before, I paid a couple hundred for school fees,\" said Mere Rigamoto, a 42-year-old mother of three boys. \"Bainimarama's government is not bad. He's OK.\"\n\nBut Bainimarama has a troubled political history that has contributed to the coup culture. There are rumors he could stage another coup should he lose the election.\n\n\"We're bound to have another coup if he doesn't win,\" said 30-year-old Robert Lum On, a recent university graduate.\n\nFiji became independent from the U.K. in 1970. In 1987, Rabuka staged two racially charged coups to return the country to the hands of indigenous Fijians, called \"iTaukei,\" and away from Fijians of Indian descent, or Indo-Fijians.\n\niTaukei make up about 57 percent of the country's population, while Indo-Fijians make up 38 percent.\n\nIndo-Fijians have been a major ethnic group in Fiji since colonial times, when the British brought them in to work the sugar cane plantations. Many Indo-Fijians favor Bainimarama, whose new constitution in 2013 removed race quotas from parliament.\n\n\"Bainimarama's key success has been to establish the name 'Fijian' for all citizens of Fiji,\" said Richard Herr, a professor at Fiji National University who is based in Australia. \"His legislation has made campaigning on race, or even having a racially based party, illegal.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bainimarama accused Rabuka of stoking the flames of racism that continue to divide the nation. But some indigenous Fijians believe Rabuka will help restore their prestige, and favor his promise to bring back the nation's Great Council of Chiefs, which Bainimarama disbanded.\n\nCritics deride Bainimarama as authoritarian, but since forcing himself into power he has refashioned his image into that of a stable, legitimate leader.\n\nHis appeal was bolstered when he assumed the U.N. COP23 presidency in November 2017. In that role, which he holds until December, he shaped Fiji into a pioneer on climate change issues.\n\nWith COP23 as a platform, Fiji inserted small island developing states into the international conversation on climate change. The islands are on the front lines of global warming, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification.\n\nAfter the 2006 coup, Australia and New Zealand imposed sanctions on Fiji, and Bainimarama reoriented regional alliances toward China. His critics accuse him of selling out the country to the Chinese.\n\nThe Lowy Institute says Fiji received about $360 million in aid from China between 2006 and 2016, putting it behind only Papua New Guinea in the Pacific region. China Exim Bank holds 39 percent of Fiji's externally held public debt, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nFiji's relations have since normalized with Australia and New Zealand, but the period of sanctions enabled China to step up its regional influence.\n\nFiji has one of the healthiest economies of the Pacific Islands, and GDP is predicted to grow above 3 percent annually through 2020. Tourism is the bedrock of the economy, accounting for more than 40 percent of GDP.\n\nBainimarama's government takes credit for increasing social services, including free primary and secondary education, free bus fares for seniors, and aid in the aftermath of cyclones.\n\nBut widespread poverty persists. Bainimarama's opponents have vowed to raise the minimum wage, which remains only about $1.25 per hour.\n\nAlthough the coup culture can't be erased, many argue that Fiji has stabilized under Bainimarama.\n\n\"His prime ministership to date has been marked with a steady movement back towards democracy,\" said Pryke, of the Lowy Institute.\n\n\"While there is still more work to do \u2014 domestic media is engaged in significant self-censorship and opposition parties remain harassed \u2014 the prime minister has delivered on political stability that has enabled economic growth and development progress to be prioritized.\"\n\nPolls close at 6 p.m. Wednesday (0500 GMT). As well as Bainimarama's FijiFirst party and Rabuka's Social Democratic Liberal Party (Sodelpa), the National Federation Party (NFP) is also expected to be an election contender. In 2014, FijiFirst won 59 percent of votes, Sodelpa won 28 percent, and NFP won 5.5 percent.\n\n___\n\nNick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report.", "A man who drove a car through a crowd on a pedestrian-only Australian street last year, killing six people and injuring dozens more, was found guilty on Tuesday of all 33 charges against him, including six counts of murder.\n\nA Melbourne Supreme Court jury took less than an hour to find 28-year-old James Gargasoulas guilty of all charges, which included 27 counts of reckless conduct endangering life.\n\nGargasoulas pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, but admitted driving through Melbourne's busy Bourke Street pedestrian mall and along sidewalks in January 2017, causing death and injury.\n\nGargasoulas, who has a mental illness but didn't use that as a defense, told the court on Monday that he believed he had received God's permission, through a premonition, to hit people with the stolen car he was driving but not to kill anyone.\n\n\"I apologize from my heart but that's not going to fix anything ... neither will a lengthy sentence fix what I done,\" he said.\n\nHe'll reappear for sentencing in January.\n\nBefore the jury retired, Justice Mark Weinberg said they must accept Gargasoulas' admissions as established facts, and that because his psychosis and delusions at the time of the rampage were drug-induced, he could not argue he was not guilty by way of mental impairment.\n\nGargasoulas told the court on Monday he hadn't intended for anyone to die, but understood that \"in a sense, yes\" he knew that outcome was likely.\n\nThe murder victims ranged in age from 3 months to 33 years old.

The death toll is expected to continue to rise.\n\nThe dead were found in burned-out cars, in the smoldering ruins of their homes, or next to their vehicles, apparently overcome by smoke and flames before they could jump in behind the wheel and escape. In some cases, there were only charred fragments of bone, so small that coroner\u2019s investigators used a wire basket to sift and sort them.\n\nThe news comes after President Trump approved a \u201cmajor disaster declaration\u201d in the Golden State early Monday evening.\n\n\u201cI just approved an expedited request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of California. Wanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on. I am with you all the way. God Bless all of the victims and families affected,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown had requested the declaration on Sunday, which will bolster ongoing emergency assistance and help residents recover from fires burning in Butte, Los Angeles, and Ventura counties. Brown\u2019s declaration asked to make individuals eligible for crisis counseling, housing and unemployment help, and legal aid.\n\nThe fires have caused major havoc throughout the western state.\n\nAll told, more than 8,000 firefighters statewide were battling wildfires that destroyed more than 7,000 structures and scorched more than 325 square miles, the flames feeding on dry brush and driven by blowtorch winds.\n\nEarlier Monday, the Northern California wildfire matched at 29 the deadliest single fire on record - a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles. A series of wildfires in Northern California's wine country last fall killed 44 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes.\n\nThe search for bodies continued Monday.\n\nAs the search for victims dragged on, friends and relatives of the missing called hospitals, police, shelters and the coroner's office in hopes of learning what became of their loved ones. Paradise was a popular retirement community, and about a quarter of the population was over 65.\n\nHundreds of people were unaccounted for by the sheriff's reckoning, four days after the fire swept over the town of 27,000 and practically wiped it off the map with flames so fierce that authorities brought in a mobile DNA lab and forensic anthropologists to help identify the dead.\n\nThe cause of the Southern California fires remained under investigation, and Osby said nothing had been ruled out.\n\nAt least two people have been killed and 370 homes have been destroyed in the fires that erupted last week west of downtown Los Angeles. It is likely that crews assessing damage will discover hundreds of more homes lost in the canyons and steep hillsides in inland and coastal areas, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said.\n\nMore than 200,000 people were still under evacuation orders even as some residents were allowed to return to inland communities of Agoura Hills, Westlake Village, and Newbury Park.\n\nOsby emphasized that about 57,000 homes have been saved from the so-called Woolsey fire, which burned a path about 20 miles long and 14 miles wide \u2014 from northwest of Los Angeles through suburbs and the Santa Monica Mountains to the Malibu coast.\n\nThe death toll stood at two, a pair of adults found last week in a car overtaken by flames in Malibu. Those fatalities added to California\u2019s growing wildfire-related death toll.\n\nTrump received major backlash two days ago when after he issued an emergency declaration to provide funds to help firefighters in California as they battled at least three major wildfires across the state, the president threatened to withhold federal payments \u2014 citing the state\u2019s \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d of its forests.\n\nTweeting from Paris early Saturday, Trump wrote that \u201dthere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly fires in California.\u201d He added that \u201cbillions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Mexico's president-elect said Monday he will hold another public referendum later this month on his proposal for a railway to connect the main tourist attractions across the Yucatan peninsula.\n\nAndres Manuel Lopez Obrador said during a trip to the Yucatan state capital of Merida that the public can vote on the train and nine other proposed projects and programs Nov. 24 and 25.\n\nA referendum last month cancelled Mexico City's new $13 billion airport that was already one-third completed.\n\nLopez Obrador has said the train would run 932 miles (1,500 kilometers) across five states. He promotes it as a regional economic development project that would share the economic boom of Cancun's world class beach resorts with poorer, more remote parts of the south.\n\nAnother project on the ballot will be construction of an oil refinery in his home state of Tabasco as well as social programs such as giving scholarships to students and pensions to seniors.\n\nLopez Obrador said he would openly push for public support because they are campaign promises. He won election July 1 in a resounding victory and will take office Dec. 1.\n\nThe referendum, like the last one, will be conduction by a private nonprofit, the Rosenblueth Foundation.\n\nThousands of people marched in Mexico City on Sunday in favor of the new airport project and against the idea of public referendums.\n\nThe proposed \"Mayan train\" would run from Cancun south through Tulum and to the Mayan ruins of Palenque. A spur would include the cities of Campeche, Merida and Valladolid. Lopez Obrador previously said it would cost $6 billion to $8 billion.\n\nThe region is full of jungle, wetlands, wildlife reserves and pre-Hispanic archaeological sites, but Lopez Obrador said Monday that there would be no environmental impact. He said it would be offset by a simultaneous project to plant about 250,000 acres (100,000 hectares) of fruit and timber trees in southern Mexico.\n\n\"The truth is that I have polls and I'm very confident that the people are going to vote to build the Mayan train, because it won't hurt anyone. On the contrary, it will benefit a lot of people,\" he said.", "A British couple with neo-Nazi views who named their son after Adolf Hitler was convicted Monday of membership in an outlawed far-right group, according to multiple reports.\n\nA jury at Birmingham Crown Court in central England found 22-year-old Adam Thomas and 38-year-old Claudia Patatas guilty of being members of National Action.\n\nDuring the trial, jurors were shown photos of Thomas holding his baby son \u2014 who was given the middle name Adolf \u2014 while wearing the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan, as Sky News reported.\n\nSky News also reported that Thomas, a self-confessed Holocaust denier, moved to Israel when he was 18 to convert to Judaism so he could join the Israeli military.\n\nHe told the jury, according to Sky News, he lived in kibbutzes in Israel, and returned home in August 2016, after he \u201cjust lost interest.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said the defendants attended meetings of the banned group, and exchanged WhatsApp messages praising the Nazis\u2019 murder of Jews.\n\nA third defendant, Daniel Bogunovic, also was convicted of membership in the banned group.

Martha McSally conceded Arizona's U.S. Senate race to Democratic Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema on Monday after the latest vote count showed McSally trailing by more than 38,000 votes out of more than 2.2 million ballots cast.\n\n\"Congrats to @kyrstensinema. I wish her success,\" McSally tweeted from her official campaign account. \"I\u2019m grateful to all those who supported me in this journey. I\u2019m inspired by Arizonans\u2019 spirit and our state\u2019s best days are ahead of us.\"\n\n\"As long as I\u2019ve served Arizona, I\u2019ve worked to help others see our common humanity & find common ground,\" Sinema tweeted soon after McSally conceded. \"That\u2019s the same approach I\u2019ll take to representing our great state in the Senate, where I\u2019ll be an independent voice for all Arizonans.\n\n\"Thank you, Arizona. Let's get to work.\"\n\nSinema's victory means that Democrats have flipped the seat previously held by retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. Democrats now have 47 Senate seats, while Republicans have 51. The final makeup of the Senate will be determined following a recount in Florida and a Nov. 27 runoff election in Mississippi.\n\nFlake tweeted congratulations to Sinema \"on a race well run, and won,\" adding \"You'll be great.\"\n\nSinema, a three-term congresswoman, is Arizona's first Democratic U.S. senator since 1994. McSally, a former Air Force pilot who embraced President Donald Trump after opposing him during the 2016 elections, had claimed that Sinema's anti-war protests 15 years ago disqualified her and said one protest amounted to \"treason.\"\n\nBut during her six years in Congress, Sinema built one of most centrist records in the Democratic caucus, and she voted for bills backed by Trump more than 60 percent of the time. She backed legislation increasing penalties against people in the country illegally who commit crimes.\n\nIn remarks to supporters, Sinema paid tribute to the late Republican Sen. John McCain, who died this past August.\n\nSinema said the former prisoner of war and GOP presidential nominee was \"irreplaceable\" and \"taught us to assume the best in others, to seek compromise instead of sewing division, & to always put country ahead of party.\u201d\n\n\"As your Senator, that\u2019s exactly what I'll do,\" Sinema went on. \"Not by calling names or playing political games, but by showing up and doing the work to keep Arizona moving forward.\"\n\nMcSally's attacks on Sinema reached back more than 15 years to when Sinema was a Green Party spokeswoman and liberal activist.\n\nMcSally backed Trump's tax cut, border security and the repeal of ObamaCare as she survived a three-way GOP primary in August, defeating two conservative challengers who claimed her support for Trump was fake. McSally also campaigned on her military record and support for the armed forces.\n\nSinema attacked McSally's leadership of last year's failed ObamaCare repeal effort as a sign that she would not protect Arizona residents with pre-existing medical conditions. McSally argued that she would protect patients, despite her vote on the bill that would have removed many of those protections.\n\nThe Arizona contest drew more than $90 million in spending, including more than $58 million by outside groups, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Attack ads by both sides clogged the airwaves for months.\n\nSinema, 42, has a law degree, worked as a social worker and was a political activist in her 20s, running as an independent Green Party candidate for the Arizona House. She then became a Democrat and served several terms in the state Legislature. Sinema started as an overt liberal but developed a reputation for compromise among her Republican peers, laying the groundwork to tack to the center. She was elected to represent Arizona's newly-created 9th Congressional District in 2012.\n\nMcSally, 52, was the first female Air Force pilot to fly in combat, flying A-10 attack jets. She also was the first woman to command a fighter squadron, again in A-10s.\n\nMcSally lost her first race in Arizona's 2nd congressional district in 2012 when she was narrowly defeated by Democratic Rep. Ron Barber, who replaced Rep. Gabby Giffords after she was wounded in a 2011 assassination attempt. But McSally came back to win the 2014 election, beating Barber by a narrow margin and was re-elected in 2016.\n\nFlake was an outspoken critic of Trump and announced in 2017 that he would not seek re-election, acknowledging he could not win a GOP primary in the current political climate. His support of the president's initiatives, however, was mixed. He strongly backed last year's tax cut bill but criticized Trump's positions on free trade.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", ""]
