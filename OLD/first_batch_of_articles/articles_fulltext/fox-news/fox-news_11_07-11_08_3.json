The couple has been dating (on and off) since 2010. Their relationship has been tested in recent years \u2014 with long-distance issues, breakups and attempts to move on with new partners. But somehow, through it all, the pair found their way back to each other.\n\nTake a stroll through the pair's relationship history with this timeline of their relationship.\n\n2018\n\n\"ENGAGED!\" Ryan captioned a Nov. 8 Instagram post.

I loved Meg Ryan,\" he told Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show, according to Entertainment Tonight. \"She hates me to death.\"\n\nMellencamp admitted he'd tried to call Ryan, but she refused his attempts to reconnect.\n\n\"She hates me to death.\" \u2014 John Mellencamp\n\n\"I\u2019ve done that. She just doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me,\u201d Mellencamp said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t blame her.\"\n\nApparently, Mellencamp was wrong. Months later, the pair got back together.\n\nIn July 2017, Page Six was first to reveal they were back \"on.\" Ryan had also been spotted at Mellencamp's shows, cheering on her beau.\n\n2015\n\nIn September 2015, Mellencamp tried to move on with Christie Brinkley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m leery of discussing my relationship because I don\u2019t want to jinx it,\u201d she told Howard Stern on his SiriusXM radio show, according to Us Magazine.\n\nThe pair split about a year later, also citing distance as one of their main issues.\n\n\u201cBoth the mileage between their homes and their heavy career demands interfered with their ability to maintain the relationship,\u201d the couple's rep told the magazine. \u201cThey vowed to remain best of friends.\u201d\n\nUnlike Mellencamp, Ryan vowed to stay single.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on a little break [from love]. I\u2019m [in love] with my life right now in a way that I adore, with my kids and my world,\" she told Closer Weekly in December 2015.\n\n2014\n\nThe distance was too much for the couple in 2014. They decided to call it quits after roughly three years together.\n\n\u201cShe lives in New York and he resides in Indiana,\u201d a source told People at the time. \u201cIt was the long distance that ultimately was the cause.\u201d\n\n\"I'm going to die here.\" \u2014 John Mellencamp\n\nWhile many suggested he make a permanent move to the Big Apple to be with his girlfriend, Mellencamp revealed he was \"too sensitive\" to live there and would never leave Indiana.\n\n\"I'm going to die here,\" he told Rolling Stone in December 2013, noting he didn't like paparazzi trailing Ryan all the time.\n\n2012\n\nThe couple mostly kept their relationship private in 2012. But they were occasionally spotted on streets holding hands.\n\nRyan sold her Bel Air mansion that year, sparking rumors she was looking to move in with Mellencamp.\n\n\"Selling a home is generally a guide that there is some big change in a celebrity's life,\" Popeater columnist Rob Shuter told ABC News in 2012, though the couple's reps declined to comment on the matter.\n\n2011\n\nThe couple was still going strong the first year of their relationship.\n\nShe traveled with him as he toured internationally \u2014 in Germany, England, Ireland and beyond \u2014 in June 2011, per the Daily Mail.\n\n2010\n\nAfter Mellencamp and his wife of nearly two decades, Elaine Irwin, separated in December 2010, rumors swirled shortly after about a potential relationship with Ryan \u2014 who divorced from actor Dennis Quaid nearly a decade prior. The pair allegedly began dating around that same time but didn\u2019t go public with their romance until weeks later, according to People.\n\nIn December that year, they were spotted getting close at Martha\u2019s Vineyard and strolling along New York City streets.\n\n\"I thought that was her husband because they seemed for comfortable and familiar with each other, just like an old married couple,\u201d a source, who spotted the pair grocery shopping in SoHo, told People at the time.", "", "Several Republican voters who accused Maryland officials of redrawing a key congressional district to illegally favor Democrats won their federal lawsuit Wednesday, in a sharp rebuke of overt partisan gerrymandering that forces the state to fix the problem before the 2020 elections -- or have federal judges step in and come up with a new congressional map themselves.\n\nThe three-judge panel's decision, issued shortly after the midterm elections, orders the state to submit the new map by March 7. Otherwise, the court will appoint a commission to produce a redistricting plan for use in the 2020 congressional election.\n\nThe offending congressional district, one of eight in Maryland, was redrawn in 2011.\n\nThe panel hearing the case in U.S. District Court in Maryland said the state must redraw the 6th Congressional District's lines using \"traditional criteria for redistricting,\" showing regard for \"natural boundaries.\"\n\n\"Partisan gerrymandering is noxious, a cancer on our democracy,\" Chief District Judge James Bredar, appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, wrote in a concurring opinion.\n\nEarlier this year, President Trump made a similar argument when Republicans lost a Pennsylvania gerrymandering lawsuit, writing on Twitter that \u201cDemocrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania. ... This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole.\"\n\n\"Partisan gerrymandering is noxious, a cancer on our democracy.\" \u2014 Chief District Judge James Bredar\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court reviewed the Maryland case this summer before deciding in June to refer it back to the lower court for a decision, effectively allowing the 2011 map to remain in place for Tuesday's congressional elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court could take up the issue of partisan gerrymandering again this term, in a case from North Carolina. Republicans there have urged the justices to rule that courts should stay out of disputes about the political process.\n\nWednesday's decision, written by 4th U.S. Circuit Court Judge Paul Niemeyer, says the state's 2011 congressional map removed roughly 66,000 Republican voters from the 6th District and added around 24,000 Democratic voters, \"bringing about the single greatest alteration of voter makeup in any district in the Nation following the 2010 census.\"\n\nSUPREME COURT SIDES WITH TEXAS ON GERRYMANDERING DISPUTE\n\n\"To be sure, citizens have no constitutional right to be assigned to a district that is likely to elect a representative that shares their views. But they do have a right under the First Amendment not to have the value of their vote diminished because of the political views they have expressed through their party affiliation and voting history,\" Niemeyer wrote.\n\nCritics have cited gerrymandering as the reason why Rep. John Delaney, a Democrat who is leaving the office to run for president, was able to defeat 10-term Republican Roscoe Bartlett in 2012, a year after the map was redrawn. Democrat David Trone won the seat on Tuesday, to maintain the 7-1 edge Democrats have in the state's congressional delegation.\n\nRedistricting maps are drawn by the governor and approved by the state's General Assembly, which is currently controlled by Democrats.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said the judges' decision confirms that Maryland has \"the most gerrymandered districts in the country.\"\n\n\"This is a victory for the vast majority of Marylanders who want free and fair elections and the numerous advocates from across the political spectrum who have been fighting partisan gerrymandering in our state for decades,\" Hogan said in a statement.\n\nA spokeswoman for Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh's office, which has defended the state against the lawsuit, said in an email that the office is \"reviewing options\" after the judges' decision\n\nHogan has backed legislation designed to make congressional redistricting a nonpartisan process. Former Gov. Martin O'Malley, a Democrat, testified in a deposition for the federal lawsuit that he intended to \"create a district where the people would be more likely to elect a Democrat than a Republican.\"\n\nKathay Feng, national redistricting director for the Common Cause advocacy group, said the court's ruling demonstrates Maryland's congressional map \"squashed political participation and speech.\"\n\n\"Gerrymandering is an abuse of power no matter who does it, and both Democrats and Republicans use it for their political gain,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "", "", "", "", "Rapper Snoop Dogg is once again expressing his distaste for President Trump.\n\nIn a series of Instagram clips posted Wednesday the 47-year-old artist, whose real name is Calvin Broadus Jr., documented himself walking around the public areas near the White House while smoking marijuana.\n\n\u201c...

Tensions recently have increased, with the two sides accusing each other of undermining efforts at reconciliation following a 1998-99 war.\n\nMogherini urged Serbia and Kosovo at the meeting to \"refrain from words, actions and measures that are contrary to the spirit of normalization,\" a statement issued after the meeting said, adding \"they discussed the necessary steps for the way forward.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the next round of talks could be held.\n\nSerbia's President Aleksandar Vucic complained in an interview with the state Serbian TV that Kosovo must first revoke tariffs it has imposed on good from Serbia and Bosnia, arguing they are in violation of a regional trade agreement.\n\nVucic also criticized Kosovo's plans to create and army, warning against any attempts to deploy the future military in Serb-dominated northern Kosovo where Serbia retains strong influence.\n\n\"We are always ready to talk ... but with those who cheat every day,\" Vucic said.\n\nKosovo's President Hashim Thaci described Serbia's attitude in the talks as \"aggressive and arrogant.\"\n\n\"If Belgrade thinks it will be easy with the Kosovar side, it is wrong,\" he said. \"I know it will be very difficult, it (dialogue) has a very little possibility for agreement but we should work upon that.\"", "The Trump administration announced Thursday that migrants who attempt to cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally will not be eligible to claim asylum under a new rule meant to crack down on \"meritless\" claims.\n\nThe rule, which prevents migrants from claiming asylum if they do not do so at an official border crossing, is the latest attempt by the White House to handle a surge in migration to the U.S. from the Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nPresident Trump is expected to formally enact the rule in a presidential proclamation Friday and will invoke the same powers he used to push through a version of the travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court, according to senior administration officials.\n\n\"Consistent with our immigration laws, the President has the broad authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens into the United States if he determines it to be in the national interest to do so,\" Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a joint statement. \" ... Our asylum system is overwhelmed with too many meritless asylum claims from aliens who place a tremendous burden on our resources, preventing us from being able to expeditiously grant asylum to those who truly deserve it. Today, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a Presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was the latest push to enforce Trump's hard-line stance on immigration through regulatory changes and presidential orders, bypassing Congress. But those efforts have been largely thwarted by legal challenges and, in the case of family separations this year, stymied by a global outcry that prompted Trump to scrap them.\n\nA senior administration official said the White House hopes that by funneling asylum claimants to ports of entry, officials will be able to assess and adjudicate the claims more rapidly. The official did not say where asylum-seekers would be housed should they arrive at those ports of entry in large numbers. The official added that the rule was not retroactive and only covers future asylum claimants.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years, and there is a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nAccording to DHS, the department has seen a 2,000 percent increase since 2013 in migrants claiming that they have \"credible fear\" of persecution should they return to their home country. In 2017, the U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nA senior administration official said Thursday that the vast majority of such claims are \"non-meritorious.\"\n\nAdministration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold. Those forms of protection include \"withholding of removal\" -- which is similar to asylum, but doesn't allow for green cards or bringing families -- or asylum under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.\n\nThe rule change is likely to be challenged in court. Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, said they were clearly illegal.\n\n\"U.S. law specifically allows individuals to apply for asylum whether or not they are at a port of entry. It is illegal to circumvent that by agency or presidential decree,\" he said.\n\nThe asylum section of the Immigration and Nationality Act says a migrant is allowed to make a claim up to a year after arriving in the U.S., and it doesn't matter how they arrive -- illegally or through a border crossing.\n\nCurbing immigration has been a signature issue for Trump, who pushed it hard in the days leading up to Tuesday's midterm elections, railing against caravans of Central American migrants that are still hundreds of miles from the border.\n\nAs of Thursday, there are more than 5,600 U.S. troops deployed to the border mission, with about 550 actually working on the border in Texas. The military is expected to have the vast majority of the more than 7,000 troops planned for the mission deployed by Monday, and that number could grow.\n\nTrump has also suggested he'd revoke the right to citizenship for babies born to non-U.S. citizens on American soil and erect massive \"tent cities\" to detain migrants. Those issues were not addressed by the regulations Thursday.\n\nThe administration has long said immigration officials are drowning in asylum cases partly because people falsely claim asylum and then live in the U.S. with work permits. Trump has long said those seeking asylum should come through legal ports of entry. But many migrants are unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown clogged.\n\nOfficials have turned away asylum seekers at border crossings because of overcrowding, telling them to return later. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with some people waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego's main crossing.\n\nIt's unclear how many people en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border. About 4,800 migrants are sheltered in a sports complex in Mexico City, some 600 miles from the U.S. border. Several smaller groups were trailing hundreds of miles to the south; officials estimated about 7,000 in all were in the country in the caravans. The migrants are largely poor people and many say they're fleeing violence; more than 1,700 were children under 18, and more than 300 were children under age 5.\n\nFox News' Jake Gibson and Kelly Chernenkoff and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "", "Now that\u2019s some good customer service.\n\nA Virginia Burger King employee is going viral for her act of kindness.\n\nNineteen-year-old Alexis Easter, who works at the fast-food chain in Mechanicsville, was photographed escorting an elderly customer to his car.\n\nThe man, known to Easter as Mr. John, is a regular at the restaurant.\n\nCHICAGO DINER SERVING 'ELF'-INSPIRED SPAGHETTI SUNDAE DISH\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s done I help him to the car because he has a terrible back.

Bill Nelson.\n\nLiberal lawyers, Rubio said in an extraordinary series of tweets that alleged incompetence if not outright complicity by Florida officials, are \"descending on\" the state in a calculated attempt to \"change the results\" and \"try and steal\" races for Senate and agriculture commissioner.\n\nRubio's explosive posts come as a recount now appears imminent in Florida's high-profile gubernatorial contest between Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis, based on new vote totals -- even though Gillum has already conceded.\n\n\"Florida law requires counties report early voting & vote-by-mail within 30 minutes after polls close,\" Rubio wrote on Twitter. \"43 hours after polls closed 2 Democrat strongholds #BrowardCounty & #PalmBeachCounty are still counting & refusing to disclose how many ballots they have left to count.\"\n\nFlorida statutes mandate that the \"canvassing board shall report all early voting and all tabulated vote-by-mail results to the Department of State within 30 minutes after the polls close\" and that \"thereafter, the canvassing board shall report, with the exception of provisional ballot results, updated precinct election results to the department at least every 45 minutes until all results are completely reported.\"\n\n\"Democrat lawyers are descending on Florida. ... They aren\u2019t here to make sure every vote is counted.\" \u2014 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\nThe state code continues, \"The supervisor of elections shall notify the department immediately of any circumstances that do not permit periodic updates as required.\"\n\nVote totals in several major races in the state are changing rapidly, on an irregular schedule and sometimes late into the evening. GOP Senate candidate Rick Scott, also Florida's governor, was ahead of Nelson by roughly one-fourth of one percentage point as of Thursday morning, according to The Tampa Bay Times. The paper also said the agriculture commissioner candidates were separated by only 0.06 points. That race flipped in favor of the Democratic candidate on Thursday afternoon.\n\nBroward County reported that significantly more votes were received in the agriculture commissioner contest than the much higher-profile Senate election. An attorney for Nelson's campaign suggested a computer error might explain that anomaly.\n\nIn the closely watched gubernatorial race, DeSantis' held a narrow 0.52-percentage-point edge over Gillum as of Thursday morning, extremely close to the 0.5 percent threshold needed to trigger a machine recount. Gillum has conceded the race, although his decision is nonbinding.\n\nBut by Thursday afternoon, unofficial figures had DeSantis up by just 38,515 votes out of the more than 8 million cast -- a lead of just 0.47 percent, low enough to trigger a mandatory recount, according to The Tallahassee Democrat. No recount has yet been announced by Florida's secretary of state, and the first unofficial count is expected to be verified Saturday by Florida's secretary of state.\n\n\"On Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count,\" Gillum's campaign said in a statement Thursday evening. \"Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported. Our campaign, along with our attorney Barry Richard, is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount.\"\n\nWithout providing legally sufficient justification, Rubio said, Democrat-controlled Broward and Palm Beach counties on Wednesday afternoon continued to report new ballots, cutting into Scott's already-thin lead and flipping the state's agriculture commissioner race to Democrats. Provisional ballots cast by voters without proper identification or at the wrong location are factoring into the late results, and Florida officials have rejected campaigns' requests for the identity of those voters, citing federal and state law.\n\nPalm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher told Fox News that Palm Beach is still counting about 2,000 mail-in ballots where voters circled or highlighted (by drawing an arrow pointing at the candidate\u2019s name) their choice, instead of filling in the appropriate bubbles.\n\nUnder Florida law, the state elections department is allowed to determine voter intent. Bucher told Fox News that elections department staff is going through each of the 2,000 mail-in ballots, and where voter intent is determined, a worker is filling in a new ballot on behalf of the voter. Where voter intent cannot be determined, the ballot is sent to the canvassing board to undergo review.\n\nElections officials are also reviewing 1,500 military and overseas ballots which are still being counted. Florida law allows military servicemembers to mail or fax ballots in. A provisional vote report is due in Tallahassee on Saturday by noon.\n\nGEORGIA DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE STACEY ABRAMS REFUSES TO CONCEDE\n\n\"#Broward election supervisors ongoing violation of #Florida law requiring timely reporting isn\u2019t just annoying incompetence,\" Rubio wrote. \"It has opened the door for lawyers to come here & try to steal a seat in the U.S. Senate & Florida Cabinet.\"\n\nBroward county election officials did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.\n\nRubio added: \"Now democrat lawyers are descending on #Florida. They have been very clear they aren\u2019t here to make sure every vote is counted. - They are here to change the results of election; & - #Broward is where they plan to do it.\"\n\nUnder Florida law, if the margin in any race hits 0.25 percent or lower, a manual recount of any ballots set aside from the machine recount will be ordered -- reminiscent of the scene in the 2000 presidential election, when the country was gripped by images of poll workers counting votes deciphering hanging chads by hand.\n\nThe Supreme Court voted by a 7-2 majority that Florida's recount in that race violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because each country and precinct adopted varying standards for how it would conduct the recount. By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court ended the recount on other grounds.\n\nFOX NEWS HALFTIME REPORT: FLORIDA RACES ARE TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT\n\nRubio made clear he has no confidence in the integrity of South Florida's election officials, suggesting a posssible GOP-led court challenge might be looming.\n\n\"A U.S. Senate seat & a statewide cabinet officer are now potentially in the hands of an elections supervisor with a history of incompetence & of blatant violations of state & federal laws,\" he wrote, linking to a Miami Herald article describing several scandals that have gripped Broward County\u2019s Elections Department.\n\nEarlier this year, a judge found that Broward Elections Supervisor Brenda Snipes had illegally destroyed ballots in a 2016 congressional contest, leading the governor's office to assign election monitors to supervise her.\n\n\u201cI think the problems are blown out of proportion,\u201d Snipes said in October, in an interview with The Miami Herald. \u201cBroward is nitpicked to the bone.

Gary Giles, of Moroni, died on Sunday after a series of medical tests and transfers landed him in the intensive care unit at Intermountain Medical Center.\n\nGiles\u2019 widow, Juanita, said that the pair frequently allowed bats to land on their hands and lick their fingers because they didn\u2019t know that they were infected with rabies. She told KSL.com that she has woken up in the night to find them walking on the couple\u2019s bed.\n\nNEVADA VOTES TO ELIMINATE 'TAMPON TAX' ON FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS\n\n\u201cThe bats never hurt us, and we were always catching them in our hands and releasing them outside because you hear all the time and how bats are good for the insect population, and you don\u2019t want to hurt them,\u201d she told KSL.com. \u201cThe bats would lick our fingers, almost like they could taste the saltiness of our fingers, but they never bit us.\u201d\n\nBut on Oct. 19, Giles landed in the emergency room with intense back and neck pain, which was diagnosed as a potentially pulled muscle. According to a GoFundMe page, his symptoms progressed to numbness and tingling in his arms, which led to muscle spasms. He was reportedly transferred to the ICU after he began reacting poorly to the medication. He was eventually intubated and sedated, with later brain scans revealing that he was experiencing multiple seizures every hour.\n\nAccording to his obituary, Giles died surrounded by his family. The Utah Department of Health confirmed a rabies-linked death in the state.\n\n'RAT LUNGWORM' EXPLAINED: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE PARASITIC ROUNDWORM\n\nA state epidemiologist warned about the dangers of being around bats.\n\n\u201cIf you find yourself near a bat, dead or alive, do not touch, hit or kill it,\u201d Dallin Peterson told the Salt Lake Tribune. \u201cCall your health care provider or local public health department immediately to report the possible exposure and determine whether preventative treatment is necessary.\u201d\n\nRabies is a preventable viral disease of mammals most often transmitted through the bite of an infected animal. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the vast majority of cases occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, and foxes. The virus affects the central nervous system and may first present as fever, headache, weakness or discomfort. Symptoms can then advance to insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partial paralysis, excitation, hallucinations, agitation, hypersalivation, difficulty swallowing and fear of water. Death typically occurs within days of the advanced symptoms.", "The party of Mexico's president-elect submitted legislation Thursday that would legalize marijuana possession, public use, growing and sales.\n\nSen. Olga Sanchez Cordero presented the measure, saying that everyone should have \"the right to carry up to 30 grams (one ounce) of cannabis.\" People could carry more than an ounce if they requested a permit to do so under the proposal.\n\n\"From the point of view of negative effects, there is no reason why marijuana should not be legal, if alcohol and tobacco are,\" according to the bill.\n\nCordero has been picked as interior secretary by President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1. She is currently a senator for Lopez Obrador's leftist Morena party.\n\nHer bill also would allow every Mexican to grow up to 20 marijuana plants on private property and produce up to 17 ounces (480 grams) a year. Public smoking of marijuana would be allowed, \"except in tobacco smoke-free spaces.\"\n\nSales of marijuana would be regulated by a special agency, which would oversee purity, packaging and quality. Sales of edible marijuana products would be prohibited, as would advertising or promoting marijuana. Providing pot to minors would be illegal, and driving while under the influence of marijuana would be subject to prosecution.\n\nThe bill would have to be approved by both houses of congress, where Morena and its allies hold majorities in both chambers.\n\nIn 2016, Mexico's government began granting permits for some patients to import medicinal marijuana products. It has also decriminalized the possession small amounts of marijuana (about 5 grams) and issued several permits for people to cultivate and possess pot for personal use.\n\nUruguay was the first country to legalize marijuana for personal use.

This would make it slightly older than similar animal paintings found in famous caves in France and Spain. Until a few years ago, experts believed Europe was where mankind's ancestors started drawing animals and other figures.\n\n\u201cThe oldest cave art image we dated is a large painting of an unidentified animal, probably a species of wild cattle still found in the jungles of Borneo \u2013 this has a minimum age of around 40,000 years and is now the earliest known figurative artwork,\u201d said Maxime Aubert, an associate professor at Australia\u2019s Griffith University, in a statement.\n\nSCIENTISTS SAY INDONESIA CAVE DRAWINGS THE SAME AGE AS THOSE IN EUROPE\n\nAubert led the research project, which also included Indonesia\u2019s National Research Centre for Archaeology (ARKENAS), and the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). The study is published in the journal Nature.\n\nScientists note that, while Borneo is Earth\u2019s third largest island, for most of the Ice Age, it formed the easternmost tip of the vast continental region of Eurasia. Europe was at the western extremity of the vast 8,078-mile-wide landmass.\n\n\u201cIt now seems that two early cave art provinces arose at a similar time in remote corners of Palaeolithic Eurasia: one in Europe, and one in Indonesia at the opposite end of this ice age world,\u201d said Griffith University Associate Professor Adam Brumm, who participated in the study, in a statement.\n\nMYSTERIOUS ROCK ART UNCOVERED IN CAVES ON UNINHABITED CARIBBEAN ISLAND\n\nThe remote limestone caves on Borneo have been known to contain prehistoric drawings since the 1990s. To reach them, Aubert and his team used machetes to hack through thick jungle in a verdant corner of the island.\n\nStrapping on miners' helmets to illuminate the darkness, they walked and crawled through miles of caves decorated with hundreds of ancient designs, looking for artwork that could be dated. They needed to find specific mineral deposits on the drawings to determine their age with technology that measures the decay of the element uranium.\n\nIn 2014, Aubert and his fellow researchers reported on cave art from the neighboring Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Measuring uranium decay, they dated hand stencils, created by blowing red dye through a tube to capture the outline of a hand pressed against rock, to almost 40,000 years ago.\n\nPREHISTORIC CAVE BELIEVED TO BE 10 MILLION YEARS OLD FOUND IN TEXAS\n\nWith the Borneo cave art, the scientists are able to construct a rough timeline of how art developed in the area. In addition to the bull, they dated red- and purple-colored hand stencils and cave paintings of human scenes.\n\nAfter large animal drawings and stencils, \"It seems the focus shifted to showing the human world,\" Aubert said.\n\nRock art discoveries continue to be a source of fascination for archaeologists. Last year, researchers uncovered a vast array of mysterious pre-Columbian rock art in the caves of a remote uninhabited Caribbean island.\n\nArchaeologists made the discovery while exploring around 70 cave systems on Puerto Rico\u2019s Mona Island. The thousands of designs, created centuries ago, comprise the largest concentration of indigenous pre-Columbian rock art in the Caribbean, according to experts.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.

A new president will be elected to replace him during the organization's general assembly in Dubai on Nov. 18-21.\n\nChinese authorities said they detained Meng, 64, on bribery charges, though his wife has described him as a victim of political persecution. He was China's vice minister of public security and appears to be the latest ranking Chinese official to have been caught in a sweeping purge under President Xi Jinping.\n\nStock said his organization learned of Meng's disappearance on Oct. 5 via media reports that came out after Meng's wife said she had not heard from him since the end of September and reported him missing.\n\nInterpol contacted Beijing, asking for clarification, according to Stock. A high-level Chinese delegation arrived at Interpol's Lyon headquarters on Oct. 7, reported that Meng had written a resignation letter and advised that he was no longer a delegate from China to Interpol \u2014 meaning he could no longer serve as president.\n\nChina's Interpol office transmitted the resignation letter to Interpol headquarters later that day. Pressed on whether Interpol had assurances Meng actually wrote it or did so without duress, Stock hedged.\n\n\"There was no reason for me to (suspect) that anything was forced or wrong,\" he said.\n\nInterpol appeared to accept the Chinese delegation's explanation at face value and publicly announced that night that Meng had stepped down, without commenting on why or what happened.\n\nStock cited the structure and nature of the 192-member organization, which provides a platform for member nations to share information on criminal activities, and the vast needs it fulfills in trying to contain ballooning transnational crime. Interpol databases are queried 200 times each second by police around the world, he said.\n\n\"We are a rules-based organization. That is very important to understand,\" Stock said, adding that the role of Interpol is \"not to govern over member states.\"\n\n\"We are not an investigative body,\" he said.\n\nStock said he is in \"constant\" contact with the national central bureau in Beijing that serves as Interpol's point of contact in China. As secretary general, Stock manages Interpol's day-to-day activities, while the agency's elected president has a less hands-on, more symbolic role.\n\n\"We are strongly encouraging China\" to come forth with details of Meng's case, Stock said. He suggested Chinese officials would \"when the right moment comes.\"\n\nMeng's wife, Grace Meng, told The Associated Press last month that she received threats after her husband disappeared. She and their two children are under police protection in Lyon.\n\n\"There is no doubt this is a very regrettable situation,\" Stock said. \"But on the other hand, we have to ensure day-to-day operations ... continue.\"\n\nHe also conceded that Interpol must \"mitigate negative impact\" springing from Meng's disappearance.\n\nInterpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to hunt down suspects outside their borders. Governments have repeatedly tried to use Interpol to find political enemies, even though its charter explicitly proclaims its neutrality and prohibits use of police notices for political reasons.\n\nStock said that ensuring the notices are not misused has been one of his priorities.", "Actress-turned-activist Alyssa Milano won\u2019t speak at the next Women\u2019s March unless its organizers condemn controversial, anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.\n\nWomen\u2019s March organizers Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory have been tied to Farrakhan in the past. Mallory even refused to denounce Farrakhan after attending a speech in which he said, \"The powerful Jews are my enemy.\u201d\n\nSarsour went on to defend Mallory in a lengthy Facebook post, declaring that she would \u201cnot sit back while a strong, bold, unapologetic, committed Black woman who risks her life every day to speak truth to power and organize and mobilize movements is questioned, berated and abused.\u201d\n\nThe Women\u2019s March eventually condemned Farrakhan\u2019s comments in a statement back in March, but it wasn\u2019t good enough for Milano.\n\n\u201cAny time that there is any bigotry or anti-Semitism in that respect, it needs to be called out and addressed. I\u2019m disappointed in the leadership of the Women\u2019s March that they haven\u2019t done it adequately,\u201d Milano told The Advocate.\n\nSarsour, a pro-Palestinian activist, has repeatedly praised Farrakhan and refused to condemn him. Mallory called him the \u201cGOAT\u201d or \u201cGreatest of all time,\u201d and served as a national organizer for his \u201cJustice or Else\u201d rally in 2015.\n\nMilano told The Advocate she noticed their views regarding Farrakhan and would turn down a chance to speak at the next event if Sarsour and Mallory were still involved.\n\n\u201cI would say no at this point. Unfortunate that none of them have come forward against [Farrakhan] at this point. Or even given a really good reason why to support,\u201d Milano said.\n\nFarrakhan has also said \u201cwhite folks are going down\u201d and refers to Jewish people as termites.\n\nFarrakhan is well known for his anti-Semitic, homophobic and controversial views. The height of his prominence came when he organized the 1995 Million Man March in Washington, a symbol of black pride and empowerment. He made headlines recently be saying \"Death to Israel\" in Farsi and was accused of substituting \"America\" for \"Israel\u201d in the official language of Iran.\n\nHis controversial rhetoric goes back decades but prominent Democrats have been hesitant to denounce him. In June, Twitter took away Farrakhan's verified status after he posted a video in which he ranted about \"the Satanic Jew and the Synagogue of Satan.\" Twitter is frequently under fire for allowing Farrakhan to have an account at all.\n\nThe next Women\u2019s March is scheduled for Jan. 19.\n\n\u201cWe are outraged.

She says she didn't know she was pregnant and was told it was just a means of pregnancy prevention. Over several days she endured bleeding and intense pain as a pregnancy was aborted. With time, and much therapy, she says she came to view the experience as a \"violation.\"\n\nShe writes that she had been \"paralyzed\" with fear the first time Escobar was intimate with her. \"I wasn't ready, I did not feel sexual malice, I did not have the necessary tools to understand what this intimate and intense contact meant,\" she says.\n\nTalking of the abortion, something she had kept even from her children until now, she says, \"I had to connect with my history and immerse myself in the depths of my soul, to find the courage to reveal the sad secret that I have harbored for 44 years.\"\n\nHenao says she decided to break her long silence and write the 523-page book with the hope that younger generations of Colombians would see how much blood has spilled in Colombia as a result of its cocaine business.\n\nBut it is also a page-turner that provides an intimate look at Escobar's fast evolution from a small-time grave robber to one of the world's most wanted fugitives.\n\nHenao says she met Escobar when she was 12. She came from an upstanding, traditional family in the Envigado district near Medellin and disobeyed her parents by falling in love with Escobar, the son of a poor watchman who rode around their neighborhood in a flashy Vespa motorcycle and was 11 years her senior.\n\nDuring a courtship that led to marriage when Henao was 15, Escobar showered her with gifts like a yellow bicycle and serenades of romantic ballads.\n\n\"He made me feel like a fairy princess and I was convinced he was my Prince Charming,\" she writes.\n\nBut from the start there were long, unexplained absences and he frequently flirted with other women. As Escobar began to amass a fortune, he also became manipulative and paranoid, she says.\n\nHenao insists she was largely kept in the dark about details of his criminal activities and says she escaped from the \"inferno\" of living alongside Escobar by creating an alternative world devoted to their two children and collecting expensive artworks by the likes of Dali and Rodin.\n\nAfter the Medellin cartel's 1984 assassination of Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara, Escobar went into hiding and waged a bloody war with the state that included killing a presidential candidate and blowing up a commercial jetliner. Over much of the next decade, until Escobar died during a 1993 rooftop shootout with police, the family's contact with the kingpin consisted of short visits to safe houses where Henao and her children arrived blindfolded and were escorted by Escobar's army of assassins.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with Colombia's W Radio before the Nov. 15 publication of the book, Henao started off by apologizing to Colombians for what she said was the enormous damage her husband caused the nation. Referring to him throughout the interview as \"Pablo Escobar,\" she said she felt a mix of pain, profound embarrassment and disappointment with the man who had been the love of her life.\n\n\"I chose to bear all of this pain to protect my children,\" she said.\n\nAfter Escobar was killed, Henao began a frenzied search for asylum, fearing that his many enemies would extract revenge and kill her children. After being turned down by Germany and Mozambique, among other countries, they settled in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and changed their names.\n\nThere, an attempt to lead a relatively normal life was interrupted when they were arrested in 1999 for money laundering. They were charged again this year for allegedly helping a Colombian drug trafficker hide money through real estate and a cafe known for its tango performances. Henao denies any wrongdoing and said once again that she and her children are being unfairly targeted because of their former last name.\n\nIn 2009, Escobar's son, who now goes by the name Sebastian Marroquin, starred in a documentary in which he seeks to atone for his father's sins by meeting with the orphaned sons of Lara and another prominent victim of his father's cartel. The film left Colombians transfixed and spurred a more dispassionate look at Escobar's role in the 1980s and 1990s drug wars.\n\nBut with the proliferation of books, the hit Netflix \"Narcos\" series, and tours of Escobar's former haunts in Medellin, some worry that the capo is being glorified by younger Colombians who didn't live through the bloodbath.\n\nAnd even a quarter century after his death, not everyone is willing to forgive.\n\nWriting recently in the newspaper El Tiempo, popular columnist Maria Isabel Rueda said that Henao's book \"isn't the excuse of a victim, but of a shameless senora who knew perfectly well that she and her family swam in rivers of gold preceded by a flood of deaths.\"\n\n___\n\nJoshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman", "A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled against the Trump administration Thursday, saying the government cannot immediately end the DACA program that gives young undocumented immigrants a chance to continue living and working in the U.S. without the threat of deportation.\n\nThe administration had sought to block an injunction from lower courts that temporarily prevented the government from going ahead with plans to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\n\u201cThe Executive wields awesome power in the enforcement of our nation\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d the ruling said. \u201cOur decision today does not curb that power, but rather enables its exercise in a manner that is free from legal misconceptions and is democratically accountable to the public.\u201d\n\nThe ruling comes just days after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to take over three cases concerning pending lawsuits that seek to preserve DACA.\n\nDACA, which was created under the Obama administration through executive order, gives some illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a tremendous victory for our young immigrant Dreamers and the rule of law,\u201d said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. \"In California and across our nation, Dreamers significantly enrich our communities as scholars, entrepreneurs, first responders and much more. This fight, of course, is far from over. We will continue to defend Dreamers and DACA all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASKS SUPREME COURT TO FAST TRACK DACA CASES IN BID TO BYPASS NINTH CIRCUIT\n\nThe White House fought back on those decisions, which were premised on the idea that the Executive Branch cannot arbitrarily phase out a right that individuals have come to rely on, simply by arguing that the right was established illegally without congressional approval.\n\nDACA proponents have also argued that Trump\u2019s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.\n\nEarlier this year, in February, the Trump administration similarly attempted to appeal to the Supreme Court after another lower court ordered that DACA resume. The Supreme Court rejected that request.\n\nThe cases are DHS v. Regents of the University of California (18-587) (CA9); Trump v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (18-588) (CADC); and Nielsen v. Vidal (18-589) (CA2). The Trump administration is seeking to convince the Supreme Court to consolidate those cases because they make the same substantive objections to the planned DACA rollback, and toss them all out on the merits.\n\nFox News' Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "LONDON (AP) \u2014 A wheelchair used by physicist Stephen Hawking has sold at auction for almost 300,000 pounds ($393,000), while a copy of his doctoral thesis fetched almost 585,000 pounds ($767,000), auctioneer Christie's said Thursday.\n\nThe motorized chair, used by Hawking after he was paralyzed with motor neuron disease, raised 296,750 pounds in a Christie's online auction.

The asteroid \u2014 literally shaped like a diamond \u2014 is reportedly located about 80 million miles from Earth and has been eyed by space exerts for quite some time.\n\nUsing a camera on NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, researchers were able to capture more than four hours of footage of the asteroid, known as Bennu, from just 122 miles away.\n\nIn a series of snapshots, taken every 2.5 milliseconds, NASA was able to show the asteroid \"rotating for one full revolution.\"\n\nCOMETS AND ASTEROIDS COULD BE FLINGING LIFE ALL OVER THE GALAXY, STUDY FINDS\n\nThe shape of Bennu fascinates scientists who are hoping to learn more about the makeup of the space rock, which has been compared to the asteroid known as Ryugu, the focus of Japan's Hayabusa2 space mission.\n\n\"We think they're very loose aggregates. They're not solid through and through,\" Melissa Morris, OSIRIS-REx deputy program scientist at NASA, said during a webcast last week. \"And so, as they rotate, you can actually basically spin things out and create almost that top shape.\"\n\nNASA will continue to examine the 1,650-foot-wide Bennu, which is \"likely rich in organic molecule,\" over the next several months, Space.com reports.\n\n'CRAZY' ROCKY SURFACE OF ASTEROID RYUGU REVEALED IN MASCOT LANDER IMAGES\n\nAsteroid-sampling spacecraft OSIRIS-REx, which has been traveling in space for roughly two years, first viewed Bennu in August.\n\n\"[It's] NASA\u2019s first mission to visit a near-Earth asteroid, survey the surface, collect a sample and deliver it safely back to Earth,\" NASA explained in an Aug. 24 news statement.\n\n\"I can\u2019t wait to see what Bennu reveals to us.\u201d \u2014 Dante Lauretta\n\nAfter traveling more than 1 billion miles, OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to officially arrive at Bennu on Dec. 3.

Six suspected Bangladeshi traffickers were also arrested while the rescued refugees were sent back to their camps in the district, he said.\n\nDas said they were lured by the traffickers with promises of marriages and jobs in Malaysia.\n\nHe said the rescued refugees told them they paid money to the traffickers who said they would soon land in Malaysia amid fears that they would have no future in Myanmar's Rakhine state if they are sent back.\n\n\"I paid 10,000 takas ($120) to a Rohingya man who told me he will send me to Malaysia. He has chosen a man there for me for my marriage,\" 17-year-old Shawkat Ara said.\n\n\"I attempted once at night but returned as my boat left before I could reach there recently,\" she said.\n\nBangladesh and Myanmar said recently that the countries want to start repatriation of the refugees in a limited scale from mid-November.\n\nAbul Kalam, a senior Bangladeshi repatriation official in Cox's Bazar, told The Associated Press that they were preparing to start the repatriation of some 2,660 refugees from 485 families on Nov. 15. But many of the refugees are reluctant to go back, fearing persecution and an uncertain future.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations in a statement in Geneva urged Bangladesh and Myanmar to halt the process of sending them back from this month, saying it does not see any guarantee that they would not suffer \"the same persecution and horrific violence\".\n\nMore than 700,000 Rohingya have fled Myanmar since last year amid an army-led crackdown. Thousands were killed in the violence.\n\nRohingya Muslims have lived for centuries in Myanmar but they have long been treated as outsiders in a largely Buddhist nation who are denied citizenship and many basic rights. Many in Myanmar ridicule them as \"Bengalis\" who came from Bangladesh.\n\nThe refugees are seeking U.N. protection to return home. The U.N. refugee agency and Bangladesh had earlier finalized a memorandum of understanding that said the repatriation process must be \"safe, voluntary and dignified ... in line with international standards.\"", "Pope Francis has decreed that an American religious brother, James Miller, was killed out of hatred for the Catholic faith during Guatemala's civil war and can be beatified.\n\nMiller is the second American slain in Guatemala to move a step closer to possible sainthood in recent years. The Rev. Stanley Rother, who was gunned down during the Guatemalan conflict in 1981, was beatified as a martyr in his native Oklahoma last year.\n\nThe Vatican said Thursday that Francis approved a decree recognizing that Miller, from Stevens Point, Wisconsin, died as a martyr on Feb. 13, 1982, in Huehuetenango, Guatemala. The 37-year-old Miller had been working with indigenous youths as a member of the De La Salle Christian Brothers when he was killed by three masked men.\n\nNo one was ever arrested in the slaying. Miller's fellow brothers reported receiving warnings that Guatemala's armed forces intelligence unit, the G-2 death squad, was looking for them.\n\nA U.N. truth commission determined that some 245,000 people were killed or disappeared during Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war, which pitted right-wing, U.S.-backed governments against leftist guerrillas and indigenous peoples. The vast majority of the killings were attributed to the army or to pro-government paramilitary groups.\n\nBeing declared a martyr exempts Miller from the usual beatification requirement of having a miracle attributed to his intercession confirmed. However, such a miracle would be required for him to be declared a saint. A date for his beatification has not been set.\n\nMiller was one of more than a dozen people whose saint-making causes advanced during an audience Wednesday between Francis and the head of the Vatican's saint-making office. During the audience, Francis took the unusual step of decreeing that Michael Giedroyca, a lay member of the Order of St. Augustine during the 15th century, could be beatified without being declared a martyr or having a miracle attributed to his intercession.\n\nGiedroyc was born in Lithuania with a condition that resulted in short stature. He spent much of his life in Krakow, Poland, where he died in 1485.\n\nFrancis has granted a handful of such \"equivalent\" decrees for well-known and revered saintly figures, including Pope John XXIII, whom Francis declared a saint alongside St. John Paul II in 2014.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the city where Miller was killed is spelled Huehuetenango, not Huehuetenago.", "Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious anti-Semite who recently compared Jewish people to termites and led a \u201cDeath to America\u201d chant in Iran, continued his lifelong knack for repugnant remarks by warning President Trump on Thursday not to pull \u201cthe trigger of war in the Middle East at the insistence of Israel.\u201d\n\nFarrakhan, 85, was in the Islamic Republic when he criticized the Trump administration for snapping back economic sanctions on Iran after the U.S. pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal signed during the Obama administration.

The incident kicked off the Islamic Revolution, and Farrakhan told an Iranian audience that black Americans should be considered among the revolutionaries. The infamous activist cited the actions of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, who ordered the release of black Americans among the 1979 captives.\n\nAfter the video surfaced online, Farrakhan said in a statement he \u201cnever led a chant calling for death to America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked a question about how to pronounce the chant in Farsi during my meeting with Iranian students and an examination of the video shows just that,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked to repeat the chant on Thursday, he turned around the question to issue another warning to Trump.\n\n\u201cIt is your policies that are eroding trust for you in the world, favor for you in the world, and now you are pulling apart, confused,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do this, you will bring about \u2014 not the Iranian chant \u2014 you will bring about the death of the greatest nation that has been on this Earth in the last 6,000 years.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Caleb Parke and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nFox Business' Jennifer Eckhart and comedian Kevin Downey Jr. Join Tom Shillue to discuss the most important stories of the day including...

Quick access to innovation that can save the lives of men and women who put their lives on the line should be a priority.\n\nThe very same advances that will save lives on the battlefield have huge potential to save civilian lives too. It could save a child in a car accident who is heavily bleeding in small town, USA, save commuters who were attacked by a terrorist with a nerve agent in the subway in NYC, save church group volunteers on a humanitarian mission in South America from contracting malaria after a hurricane \u2026 to name just a few examples.\n\nHere are three exciting new solutions to defeat deadly threats that have already received the jet engine boost from this new law and DoD/FDA team-up.\n\nFrench and Freeze Dried \u2013 Saving Lives from Bullets and Bombs\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen freeze-dried coffee, then it is a similar concept \u2026 except this is blood with the water freeze-dried out to produce dry plasma and clotting protein-rich, stable, genuinely life-saving powder. A dose of this new amazing innovation can literally mean the difference between life and death.\n\nBEE-SIZED BOTS SET TO DOMINATE FUTURE BATTLES FOR CITIES\n\nWhy would anyone want to freeze-dry blood?\n\nSince WWII, the quest for the life saving holy grail of freeze-dried plasma (FDP) has been ultimately unsuccessful - until now.\n\nOne of the first exciting developments in this new era is the French FDP project (aka Centre de Transfusion Sanguine des Arm\u00e9es\u2019 Pathogen-Reduced Leukocyte-Depleted Freeze-Dried Plasma).\n\nHemorrhage (aka \u201cbleeding out\u201d) is the leading cause of preventable deaths among combat trauma casualties.\n\nBullets, shrapnel, bombs and other things flying around the battlespace can cause a wound where it is difficult to control and stop the bleeding.\n\nAUSA 2018 IN PICTURES: THE BIGGEST LAND WARFARE SHOWCASE IN YEARS\n\nPlasma is used to help manage and stop both hemorrhaging and coagulopathy. The proteins in the plasma help to clot blood. Up until now, forces were often stuck with frozen plasma \u2013 or nothing.\n\nWhen forces are deployed to remote areas, it is unlikely they will have a Maytag fridge handy to store plasma properly.\n\nWhen moving around the battlespace, forces are frequently limited to what they carry with them for emergency medical care. The most common alternative for today\u2019s warriors is lugging frozen blood \u2013 with a thawing device and a way to keep it cold - around the battlefield to have on hand in an emergency.\n\nFreeze-dried plasma is lightweight, doesn\u2019t need a thawing device and can be kept at room temperature.\n\nA medic can simply reach inside his or her backpack, reconstitute the French FDP and it is immediately available for transfusion for the wounded. This can buy crucial time to evacuate the wounded to state-of-the-art military facilities for further care.\n\n\u2018TERMINATOR\u2019 TANKS WITH \u2018INVISIBILITY\u2019 CLOAKING WILL FIGHT FUTURE WARS\n\nWith the \u201cEmergency Use Authorization,\u201d military combat wounds from firearms, bullets, shrapnel and explosive devices can now receive the remarkable game-changer in many circumstances.\n\nThe product will most likely continue to evolve, but the U.S. military has already had excellent results from using the FDP in real battlefield conditions.

Protecting U.S. troops from chemical weapons is also an important priority.\n\nSarin, VX, Soman and Tabun are all known chemical warfare nerve agent weapons. Even in a very tiny amount, nerve agents are extremely deadly. These horrible, toxic weapons can be odorless and colorless, providing very little warning of the attack before symptoms start to manifest. The likelihood of survival, the side effects and speed with which symptoms appear varies based on factors like type of agent, exposure method and exposure duration.\n\nNEW US NUCLEAR BOMBS AND FUTURISTIC STEALTH AIRCRAFT TO PROVIDE MIND-BOGGLING MILITARY MIGHT\n\nWithin seconds, you can lose consciousness and begin convulsions. Death can occur within minutes.\n\nThis means that a victim of nerve agent attack may only have a window of mere minutes to begin treatment to survive.\n\nAnother exciting advance in this pipeline is the atropine autoinjector device \u2013 it can be pulled out of a pocket or backpack and within seconds save the life of someone exposed to chemical nerve agents.\n\nWith this new autoinjector, troops simply need to take it out when they have been exposed. Atropine is one of the most commonly used drugs for nerve agent poisoning. Loaded with an atropine dose, the user simply applies it to a thigh muscle and it will rapidly inject.

What occurred was more of a steady, light blue rain.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Republicans lost the House by a comparatively small margin and gained firmer control of the Senate.\n\nSpecifically, with some close races still undecided, Democrats have picked up at least 29 seats in the House. Republicans have picked up at least one seat in the Senate, with races in Arizona and Mississippi remaining undecided.\n\nBy comparison to the 29-seat loss suffered Tuesday by President Trump\u2019s Republican Party, President Obama\u2019s Democratic Party lost 63 seats in the in 2010 midterm elections.\n\nIn fact, the incumbent president\u2019s party has lost an average of 37 seats in midterm elections since WWII.\n\nWhile it\u2019s typical for the president\u2019s party to lose seats in the House in midterms, it\u2019s highly unusual for the president\u2019s party to gain seats in the Senate in the same election. It\u2019s only happened three times in the past 104 years \u2013 in 1914, 1962 and 1970.\n\nThe GOP at long last needs to work diligently toward an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, since health care was the biggest issue at the polls.\n\nFour Senate Democrats lost elections Tuesday after voting against the confirmation of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Their seats in Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota and Florida went to the GOP (however, in Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has not conceded and is seeking a recount in his Senate race against Republican Gov. Rick Scott).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., won re-election Tuesday after voting to confirm Kavanaugh. This could signal that voters saw the Kavanaugh hearings for what they were: a farce and an outrage committed by Democrats. This consequential mistake by the Democrats will endure.\n\nIn the states of Texas, Florida and Georgia white women supported Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate and for governor. Some 59 percent supported GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas, 51 percent supported the Republican candidate for governor Ron DeSantis in Florida, and 76 percent voted for the Republican candidate for governor Brian Kemp in Georgia.\n\nDespite the far left\u2019s groundswell for women to rebuke the Republican \u201cpatriarchy,\u201d this demographic had a strong turnout in red states for the GOP.\n\nRepublicans won governor races in the traditionally blue states of Vermont, Massachusetts, and Maryland. Voters are demonstrating a willingness to consider issues and candidates more thoroughly at the state level, not just their own registered party.\n\nRepublicans must also loudly promote their success with two of the country\u2019s most enduring, important issues: the economy and national security. For many Americans, strength in these two areas is substantially more important than anything else that influences their vote. They need to be reminded why.\n\nDemocrats saw wins come in for more moderate candidates. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., was re-elected to the House.

Chinese scientists are apparently researching ways to utilize the giant creatures to help \"camouflage\" messages sent by military members.\n\nResearchers believe sperm whales may be able to hide underwater signals sent by Chinese submarines \u2014 successfully preventing any nearby enemy from detecting anything at all, the South China Morning Post reports. Instead, it will simply sound like the natural sound of the ocean.\n\nSperm whales are extremely social creatures, traveling in pods and using a variety of clicking, whistles and buzzing sounds to communicate.\n\n\"When the sound waves bounce off of an object, they return to the whale, allowing the whale to identify the shape of the object. Clicks can even help to differentiate between friendly creatures and predators,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) describes online.\n\nARMY ROBOT CAN GET ITSELF UP AFTER IT FALLS DOWN\n\nLike sperm whales, China's military would also like to send signals and warnings if they detect any potential threats.\n\nJiajia Jiang, associate professor of the State Key Lab of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments at Tianjin University in China and lead researcher on the project that was published in IEEE Communication Magazine, described two ways officials could attempt to cover up military queues to the South China Morning Post \u2014 either alter current \"man-made\" signals to make them harder to understand, or send \"weaker signals\" to make them more difficult to uncover.\n\n\u201cPlainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest.\u201d \u2014 Han Guangjie\n\nJiang says the second option is more effective, though there are, of course, pitfalls. The farther the message has to travel, the likelier it could get lost along the way.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of steganography over encryption and other conventional methods is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself, avoiding scrutiny,\u201d Han Guangjie, a computer scientist at China\u2019s Dalian University of Technology who was not involved in the research, told the Post. \u201cPlainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest.\u201d\n\nSPERM WHALE SPOTTED FOR FIRST TIME IN INLAND WATERS OF WASHINGTON STATE\n\nIn order to accomplish this, researchers said they'd have to edit sperm whale sounds to hide messages within them, while at the same time making them distinct enough that the whales wouldn't actually mistake them for their own. They'd also have to build new technology that would translate the codes for the Chinese military.\n\nWhile the idea may seem unorthodox, Newsweek points out it isn't the first time marine animals have inspired militaries.\n\nIn Ukraine and Russia, for example, dolphins are used to help detect abnormal activity near their boundaries, the magazine previously reported.", "Brazilian police arrested state legislators in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday as part of an investigation into allegations they accepted bribes in exchange for supporting a criminal organization run by a former governor, officials said.\n\nFormer Gov. Sergio Cabral is serving a prison sentence for his participation in a massive corruption scheme in which prosecutors say he received hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to help companies secure contracts that ranged from projects in Rio's slums to the refurbishing of its Maracana Stadium. He is also accused of playing a central role in a scheme to buy votes when the International Olympic Committee chose Rio to host the 2016 Olympics.\n\nPolice arrested seven sitting state lawmakers on Thursday. Warrants were also issued for three others who have had their mandates suspended and had previously been taken into custody on other charges \u2014 two are in prison and one is under house arrest. Prosecutors are asking the court to strip the lawmakers, some of whom won re-election last month, of their seats.\n\nPolice have also executed dozens of search warrants and arrested 10 other people in connection with the probe. They are still seeking two other suspects.\n\nThe probe is part of Brazil's massive Car Wash investigation, which has revealed almost systemic graft in the political system. Scores of top executives and politicians have been jailed, unleashing a wave of anger against Brazil's political class that helped pave the way for far-right congressman Jair Bolsonaro to win the presidency last month.\n\nFederal prosecutors said in a statement that the legislators are accused of accepting monthly \"allowances\" \u2014 some worth tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 in exchange for supporting Cabral. Some also were allowed to hand out civil service jobs.\n\n\"The investigations tell a story: that of how an ex-governor neutralized, with bribes and other illicit benefits, the control that state legislators should exercise over the executive, and, in this way, the criminal organization spread to various state organs and entities, causing a breakdown in the services provided to the people,\" prosecutors said.\n\nMany argue that corruption contributed to a financial crisis in Rio that, in turn, resulted in a deterioration of public services and hampered the police's ability to confront a spike in crime.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nCentral American migrants in a caravan that has stopped in Mexico City demanded buses Thursday to take them to the U.S. border, saying it is too cold and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking.\n\nMexico City authorities say that of the 4,841 registered migrants receiving shelter in a sports complex, 1,726 are under the age of 18, including 310 children under five.\n\n\"We need buses to continue travelling,\" said Milton Benitez, a caravan coordinator. Benitez noted that It would be colder in northern Mexico and it wasn't safe for the migrants to continue along highways, where drug cartels frequently operate.\n\nHe said the route and departure time would be decided at a meeting Thursday night.\n\nThe Mexican government has said most of the migrants have refused offers to stay in Mexico, and only a small number have agreed to return to their home countries.

Francisco Franco.\n\nPolice say the 63-year-old former private security guard was arrested in the town of Terrassa in the Catalonia region on Sept. 19 after a brief investigation. He remains in custody and has not been charged.\n\nThe case was revealed Thursday by Spanish newspaper Publico.\n\nPolice said they found 16 firearms in the suspect's home, ranging from handguns to sniper rifles, but did not explain how he had managed to amass such an arsenal.\n\n\"This person had a clear intention and will to take actions against the prime minister,\" Catalan regional police spokesman Albert Oliva told journalists. He added that the suspect did not appear to have concrete plans, but had been asking for logistical support on a WhatsApp group chat.\n\nAccording to Oliva, the suspect wrote in one of the messages that he was \"willing to sacrifice (himself) for Spain\" and that he showed no concern over the legal consequences of carrying out an attack.\n\nPolice say the investigation was launched after an unidentified person who had read the suspect's messages alerted them.\n\nThe far-right VOX party, which opposes the exhumation of Franco, issued a statement Thursday saying one of its local coordinators informed police of the suspect's plans after reading them on a WhatsApp group chat. VOX said the suspect was not affiliated to the party.\n\nSpain's center-left government decided earlier this year to exhume Franco's remains from a self-aggrandizing mausoleum, but officials have struggled to find an appropriate new burial place.\n\nRelatives and supporters of the late dictator oppose the exhumation. If the government goes ahead, Franco's family wants his body reinterred under Madrid's cathedral \u2014 a move that could undermine efforts to rid the country of his long shadow.\n\nSanchez on Thursday thanked police for their work and said that he was grateful for the show of support he received.\n\nThe government played down the suspected plot, calling it an isolated incident.\n\n\"Every government has experienced incidents like this,\" government spokeswoman Isabel Celaa told reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting.", "Luckily, this wasn't a close encounter of the burned kind.\n\nAfter becoming the closest spacecraft to the Sun last month, NASA's Parker Solar Probe has gotten even closer, coming within 15 million miles of our solar system's star on its own, a feat NASA has called a success.\n\nOn Monday, Nov. 5, the spacecraft whizzed past the Sun and on Wednesday, Nov. 7, it called home to let its creators know everything is in working order and it's collecting data as it should be.\n\nEND OF DAY'S TELESCOPE IMAGES REVEAL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GALAXIES COLLIDE\n\n\u201cParker Solar Probe was designed to take care of itself and its precious payload during this close approach, with no control from us on Earth \u2014 and now we know it succeeded,\u201d said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate at the agency headquarters in Washington in a statement.\n\nZurbuchen continued: \u201cParker is the culmination of six decades of scientific progress. Now, we have realized humanity\u2019s first close visit to our star, which will have implications not just here on Earth, but for a deeper understanding of our universe.\u201d\n\nIn addition to coming closer to the Sun than any other man-made spacecraft and letting us know it's in good working condition, the Probe also set a speed record, NASA added. At its closest approach, known as a perihelion, the Parker Solar Probe reached a top speed of 213,200 mph.\n\n\"Along with new records for the closest approach to the Sun, Parker Solar Probe will repeatedly break its own speed record as its orbit draws closer to the star and the spacecraft travels faster and faster at perihelion,\" the government space agency wrote in the release.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will make its last close approach to the Sun in 2025, where it will come within 3.83 million miles of the star's surface. This is seven times closer than the previous closest spacecraft, Helios 2, which came within 27 million miles of the Sun in 1976.\n\nNASA'S PARKER SOLAR PROBE SNAPS EARTH PIC AS IT SPEEDS TO THE SUN\n\nAided by the Sun's own gravity, the Probe will fly at an unbelievable 430,000 mph, NASA has said previously.

To achieve this, the probe will be protected by a special 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite shield.

A White House intern attempted to retrieve the microphone from Acosta, but the CNN reporter resisted and asked an additional question \u2013 and that\u2019s where things get cloudy.\n\nSanders said the suspension of his press credentials stemmed from his \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\" She called the behavior \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nBut many high-profile media members, including The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman and CNN executive Matt Dornic, have accused Sanders of using a doctored video speeding up Acosta\u2019s arm motion, as evidence.\n\n\u201cWe stand by our decision to revoke this individual\u2019s hard pass. We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video,\u201d Sanders tweeted to accompany the allegedly doctored video.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely shameful, @PressSec. You released a doctored video,\u201d Dornic responded.\n\n\u201cYes, the White House press office is sharing a manipulated video that makes it appear that Acosta was menacing the intern when he was not and did not. The intern reached over Acosta to grab the microphone while he was trying to ask another q and Acosta tried to pull away,\u201d Haberman wrote.\n\n\"The question is: did the reporter make contact or not? The video is clear, he did. We stand by our statement,\u201d Sanders told Fox News when reached for comment.\n\nSeveral media members have accused Sanders of using an edited video circulated by Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson. Infowars is known for spreading conspiracy theories and is banned from most social media platforms, but Watson has managed to keep his Twitter account.\n\nThe video allegedly speeds up Acosta\u2019s arm motion to make it appear that he essentially karate chopped the female intern \u2013 but Watson has taken to Twitter to defend himself.\n\n\u201cThe only editing done to this clip is that it is zoomed in,\u201d Watson wrote.\n\nFox News has not yet confirmed whether or not the video is actually doctored, or simply zooms in on the incident. NBC News tweeted its own video of the encounter.\n\n\u201cThe edited video looks authentic: Acosta appeared to swiftly chop down on the arm of an aide as he held onto a microphone while questioning President Trump. But in the original video, Acosta\u2019s arm appears to move only as a response to a tussle for the microphone. His statement, \u2018Pardon me, ma\u2019am,\u2019 is not included in the video Sanders shared,\u201d Washington Post technology reporter Drew Harwell wrote.\n\n\"I've just been denied entrance to the WH,\" Acosta tweeted Wednesday night. \"Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit.\"\n\nSanders confirmed Acosta\u2019s claim and the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association \u2013 of which Fox News is a member -- quickly released its own statement condemning the decision to revoke Acosta\u2019s credential.\n\n\u201cWe urge the White House to immediately reverse this week and misguided action,\u201d the WHCA wrote.

Candidates must file their applications on Nov. 19.\n\nHuda said all political parties would receive an equal opportunity and urged all to contest the election.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina will head an election-time government as provided for in the constitution. The opposition has demanded an independent caretaker administration, saying the election could be rigged under Hasina.\n\nHasina's arch rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, is in jail on corruption charges. It is uncertain whether her Bangladesh Nationalist Party will participate in the polls. The party and its partners boycotted the last election in 2014, when Hasina returned to power with a commanding majority.\n\nZia, 73, has been in jail since February, when she was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for alleged corruption in the establishment of an orphanage fund during her first term as prime minister in 1991-1996. Following an appeal, the High Court extended her sentence to 10 years.\n\nIn a second case, a trial court last month sentenced Zia to seven years in jail on corruption charges linked to a charity fund named after her late husband.\n\nZia's party says both cases are politically motivated.\n\nAlso last month, the Election Commission canceled the political registration of Jamaat-e-Islami, the main partner of Zia's party, which prevents it from contesting the election. The court said the party's registration violated election laws and the spirit of the constitution because the party had opposed the country's war of independence with Pakistan in 1971. The party is a fierce opponent of Hasina and is eager to regain its strength after the executions of its top leaders on charges of war crimes during the conflict.\n\nThe polls would be Bangladesh's 11th general election since it gained independence in the war.\n\nA newly formed opposition alliance quickly rejected the election schedule on Thursday and urged the Election Commission to push the date back. Zia's party is the main partner in the alliance.\n\nOn Thursday, Zia was returned to a Dhaka jail from a hospital where she had been receiving treatment for multiple health problems.\n\nZia faces more than 30 other cases pending in courts across the country.\n\nHer elder son, Tarique Rahman, the heir-apparent in a political culture of dynastic politics, has been in exile in London for years to avoid arrest. A court last month sentenced him in absentia to life in prison in a 2004 grenade attack case.\n\nBangladesh has been a parliamentary democracy since 1991 after an autocratic government led by former military chief H.M. Ershad was toppled by mass protests.

You can't argue with it; it's a very 'clean' result, which doesn't rely on interpretation.\"\n\nThe images were taken by the Hubble Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 and show the galaxy NGC 6240. The massive black holes at the center of the colliding galaxies are expanding \"as they feast on gas kicked up by the galaxy merger,\" the statement said.\n\nThe statement adds that the growth of the black holes comes from the last 10 to 20 million years of the merged galaxy, and expects that over the next 10 million years, the black holes will merge \"to form a more massive black hole.\"\n\nThey obtained the images by looking for visually obscured, active black holes, and going back through 10 years' worth of X-ray data from the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT).\n\n\"The advantage to using Swift's BAT is that it observes high-energy, 'hard' X-rays,\" said study co-author Richard Mushotzky in the statement. \"These X-rays penetrate through the thick clouds of dust and gas that surround active galaxies, allowing the BAT to see things that are literally invisible in other wavelengths.\"\n\nSPACE SHOCKER: ASTRONOMERS CONFIRM EARTH HAS TWO HIDDEN 'DUST BUNNIES' SURROUNDING IT\n\nInevitable destruction of the Milky Way galaxy\n\nSomething similar is expected to happen when our Milky Way galaxy crashes with the nearby Andromeda galaxy, though it's not expected to happen anytime soon, the researchers said.\n\n\"The images also presage what will likely happen in a few billion years, when our Milky Way galaxy merges with the neighboring Andromeda galaxy,\" the statement reads. \"Both galaxies host supermassive black holes at their center, which will eventually smash together and merge into one larger black hole.\"\n\nEarlier this year, NASA released a video simulation of what is likely to happen when both galaxies inevitably collide.\n\n\"The thin disk shapes of these spiral galaxies are strongly distorted and irrevocably transformed by the encounter,\" NASA wrote in a statement accompanying the video. \"Around 6 billion years from now, the two galaxies will merge to form a single elliptical galaxy.\"\n\nSo while a massive, cataclysmic explosion will inevitably cause the destruction of our own galaxy, it's not set to occur anytime soon.

Steyer months ago launched the \u201cNeedtoImpeach.com\u201d website and is one of the most prominent liberal advocates for ousting Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats who called for further investigation into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh over allegations of sexual misconduct (which he has denied) now have the power to pursue just that.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Federalist reported that House Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., was heard on a train to D.C. discussing going after Kavanaugh because \u201cthere\u2019s a real indication that Kavanaugh committed perjury\u201d during his confirmation hearings. However, the outlet reports that Nadler, who would be in line to take over the judiciary committee which handles impeachments, conceded it might not result in the best political outcome:\n\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario \u2014 or best case depending on your point of view \u2014 you prove he committed perjury, about a terrible subject and the Judicial Conference recommends you impeach him. So the president appoints someone just as bad.\u201d\n\nOn Trump, Nadler reportedly said that much of what they intend to do would be \u201cdepending on what [FBI Special Counsel Robert] Mueller finds.\u201d But he said that Russia investigations would be under a broad umbrella of holding Trump \u201caccountable\u201d since it\u2019s a more palatable argument than impeachment, but that they would be going \u201call-in.\u201d\n\nNadler's office did not immediately respond to a request from Fox News for comment.\n\nWhite House Counselor Kellyanne Conway cited the reported Nadler comments while discussing the \u201cred-hot tone\u201d in Washington during a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d interview Thursday.\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about red-hot tone \u2026 it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d she said, citing the Nadler discussion and other examples.\n\nNadler also hinted at how Democrats would use their investigative power in his public statement on the forced resignation of Attorney General Sessions Wednesday, in which he warned that Trump \u201ccannot take such action if it is determined that it is for the purposes of subverting the rule of law and obstructing justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he abuses his office in such a fashion, then there will be consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers have joined in those calls.\n\n\u201cThe American people like and respect fighters, and they have elected us to put a check on the executive branch,\u201d said Rep.

In a press conference Wednesday, she said Democrats wouldn\u2019t go looking for a fight, but would also investigate when they deemed it necessary.\n\n\u201cWe do not intend to abandon or relinquish our responsibility -- Article I, the first branch of government and our responsibilities for accountability, for oversight and the rest. This doesn't mean we go looking for a fight, but it means that if we see a need to go forward, we will,\u201d she said.\n\nAny impeachment push in the House would not only carry political risks but face little chance of succeeding as long as the president's party stands by him -- given that the Senate, where Republicans padded their majority, has the power to convict or acquit.\n\nHowever, she has said that unearthing Trump's personal tax returns would be \"one of the first things we'd do,\" in an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, calling it the \"easiest thing in the world\" to obtain them using statutory authority granted to congressional committees under the Internal Revenue Service code.\n\nTrump has warned Democrats that he could fire back if they pursue such a tactic, as the Senate could start investigations of Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey can play that game, but we can play better because we have a thing called the United States Senate and a lot of very questionable things were done, between leaks of classified information and many other elements that should not have taken place,\u201d he said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "I'm Chad Pergram with the Speaker's Lobby.\n\nIt's been long, strange trip for former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nA little more than two years ago, then-Republican Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions was candidate Trump's most ardent supporter in the Senate.

There are about 7,000 people who are now part of the caravan, though the numbers keep fluctuating.\n\nWhat happens then \u2013 when several thousand migrants arrive in Tijuana, a city with shelters already overcrowded with women and children? Do they live on the street, or does the city or state provide them shelter? For how long?\n\nGiven President Trump\u2019s threat to slow walk or \u201cmeter\u201d the number of asylum claims processed per day, where will asylum seekers congregate?\n\nExperts say it is unclear what will happen and how the showdown will end.\n\nThe migrant caravan has made international headlines for weeks \u2013 members have walked miles under the blazing sun and staggered in oppressive heat, and then shivered when they encountered colder climates in Mexico City. But it\u2019s now within reach of the border \u2013 and people are paying attention to what happens next.\n\nThe existing waiting list at the San Ysidro Port of Entry south of San Diego is already at 2,500 and getting a chance to enter the U.S. can take as long as six weeks.\n\nThe plaza where migrants typically wait their turn is already a showcase of desperation.\n\nDozens show up each morning to surround a local official who keeps a log with hundreds of names. Each name has a number. Based on how many asylum claims the U.S. agrees to process that day determines how many names get called.\n\nIf that slows from 60 or 70 a day to less than 10 or 20, the bottleneck creates a problem for everyone in Tijuana.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the only sign of the administration preparing to process migrants who seek to legally apply for asylum is to unfurl barb wire at places they are unlikely to cross,\u2019 says Ali Noorani, director of the left-leaning National Immigration Forum. \u201cWithout the necessary staffing and facilities in place, the administration will create chaos and hardship for Customs and Border Protection officers, migrants and surrounding communities.\u201d\n\nJessica Vaughn of the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies also sees a disaster in the making.\n\n\u201cThe legal port of entry chosen by the caravan organizers almost certainly will be disrupted to the point it will either be shut down, either officially or in effect, because the organizers almost certainly will have lawyers ready and will not want to accept \u2018take a number\u2019 for an answer,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cThis will not go over well with ordinary Mexicans who depend on access to the legal crossing points. But the organizers will be more interested in the optics of defiance.\u201d\n\nDuring the last caravan in March, organizer Puebla Sin Frontera shuttled a few hundred tired migrants to Friendship Park outside Tijuana as an apparent public relations stunt, inviting activists from San Diego and Los Angeles to rally in front of the Border Patrol.\n\nWill the open border rights group do it again to make a statement about U.S. policy, which they argue is inhumane, unfair and illegal?\n\nWill there be a backlash in the U.S., providing President Trump with an opportunity to effectively close the border, doing the migrants more harm than good?\n\nAssume half of the estimated 5,500 migrants in the caravan make it to Tijuana. Without housing or shelter, many risk crossing illegally, though many say that is not their intent.\n\n\u201cI want to go over legally and do it with hard work and everything because you can\u2019t get anything just sitting down,\u201d said 14-year-old Jorge Gomez from Guatemala.\n\nHis father, Amilcar, said he wants to do things the right way.\n\n\u201cWe do want to apply for asylum,\u201d he said, \u201cand we want to leave because there\u2019s too much violence in our country.\u201d\n\nMost of the migrants interviewed by Fox News said they want to enter legally, but experts say some will grow frustrated. Some will head east to a mountain crossing near Tecate, Mexico or further east to the Mohave and Sonora deserts near El Centro and Yuma.\n\nPresident Trump is considering a policy change to deter that option by disallowing asylum claims from those who enter illegally or do not cross at an official Port of Entry.\n\n\u201cIf the numbers hold, [the Department of Homeland Security] will be challenged logistically and with processing time,\u201d said Mike Fisher, who headed the U.S. Border Patrol from 2010 to 2015.\n\nProcessing times imposed by the courts have border officials scrambling when migrants overwhelm a given sector. The maximum allowable time is 72 hours in a border patrol detention center \u2013 and 21 days in a government shelter for families and children. At that point, officials are supposed to release the migrants, usually with an ankle bracelet.\n\nThose time limits can mean incomplete background checks, said Ron Coburn, a former deputy chief of the Border Patrol.\n\nHe fears many \u201caggravated felons are embedded in the clutter of the massive number of immigrants in order to cloak their identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chaos at the border,\u201d he said, \u201cwill undoubtedly contribute to certain very dangerous individuals being able to successfully sneak into the USA.\u201d", "A Republican whose son and daughter urged people not to vote for him lost an election to serve in the Missouri General Assembly.\n\nSteve West, 64, was defeated by incumbent Democrat Rep.

They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nUp to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, many taken to concentration camps such as Dachau or Buchenwald. Hundreds more committed suicide or died as a result of the mistreatment in the camps years before the official mass deportations began.\n\nAs Germany marked the 80th anniversary of the anti-Jewish pogroms this week with a series of memorial events, Frankenstein returned to the place where he witnessed the violence as a teenager.\n\nOne of the dwindling numbers of Holocaust survivors, Frankenstein needed a walker as he slowly entered the compound where the Auerbach'sches Waisenhaus orphanage once stood. But his memory is still sharp, and he remembers exactly how the events unfolded that night.\n\n\"A few hours after the plainclothes police officer had warned us, a group of men in uniforms came and told us, 'you need to leave now, we want to set fire to the building,'\" Frankenstein said during an interview with The Associated Press this week.\n\nThere would have been no way to take the youngest children to a safe place that quickly, he said. Frankenstein and some of the older boys at the home managed to convince the uniformed men, who belonged to the paramilitary SA, that if they burned down the orphanage the fire would spread to surrounding buildings.\n\n\"So instead, they went into our synagogue and turned off the sanctuary light in front of the holy ark,\" Frankenstein said. \"They did not turn off the gas and after they left, we suddenly could smell gas everywhere inside the building.\" Frankenstein and his peers ran inside the synagogue, tore open all windows, and turned off the gas before it could lead to an explosion.\n\n\"The men probably thought that if enough gas would stream out, the building would blow up,\" he said.\n\nKristallnacht is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. It would still be years before the Nazis formally adopted their \"Final Solution\" for the Jews of Europe, when boycotts, anti-Semitism legislation and expulsions would evolve into a policy of mass murder. In all, 6 million European Jews were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nGuy Miron, who heads Israel's Yad Vashem's Center for Research on the Holocaust in Germany, said Kristallnacht represented an end to Jewish life in Germany, a point of no return.\n\n\"Until then, the Jews could still try to convince themselves that the wheel could be turned back. After it, the rupture was complete. They realized it was over,\" he said at a Yad Vashem event this week marking the anniversary. \"Before Kristallnacht people emigrated. After it, they fled.\"\n\nStanding under an old poplar tree shedding its bright yellow leaves, Frankenstein gazed at a red brick wall \u2014 the only remainder of the orphanage in the city's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. The building was badly destroyed during a World War II air raid in 1943, and the ruins were torn down in the 1950s.\n\nThe wall was turned into a memorial for those Jewish orphans who did not survive the Holocaust, with the names and ages of 140 children inscribed on the bricks. The youngest one, Cilla Fuks, was ten months old when she was murdered.\n\nFrankenstein was one of the few who survived. In 1943 he went into hiding with his wife Leonie, whom he had met at the orphanage, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.\n\n\"We had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\" he said, still feisty after all these years. \"So we went into hiding.\"\n\nTogether with their newborn son Uri, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run.\n\nIn 1945, after the collapse of the Nazis' Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then still Palestine. Eleven years later, in 1956, they moved from Israel to Sweden where they settled for good.\n\nNowadays, Walter Frankenstein returns to Germany several times a year. He often talks to schoolchildren about his life and on Friday, the anniversary of November 9, 1938, he will be honored in an award-giving ceremony by Germany's Culture Minister Monika Gruetters.\n\nIn 2014, he received Germany's highest civil honor, the Federal Cross of Merit.\n\nEvery time Frankenstein travels to Berlin, he brings along the small blue case containing the cross. Inside the case's lid, he has attached the first \"mark\" he got from the Germans: The Yellow Badge, or Jewish Star, that he had to wear during the Nazi reign to identify him as a Jew.\n\n\"The first one marked me, the second one honored me,\" he said as he slowly closed the lid.", "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized Thursday after fracturing three ribs on her left side in a fall at her office a day earlier, the court said in a news release.\n\nGinsburg, 85, initially went home after the accident, which occurred in her Supreme Court office. But she later reported experiencing some discomfort, and was admitted to George Washington University Hospital \"for observation and treatment.\"\n\nGinsburg has survived a series of health scares. She broke two ribs in a fall in 2012, has had two prior bouts with cancer and had a stent implanted to open a blocked artery in 2014. Despite the issues, Ginsburg has yet to miss a single day of oral arguments during her tenure, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe liberal justice, who studied at Harvard Law School, was nominated to the highest court in the land by former President Bill Clinton in 1993 to replace retiring Justice Byron R. White. Ginsburg was Clinton's first Supreme Court pick. Prior to ascending to the Supreme Court, Ginsburg became the first woman to receive tenure at Columbia University Law School. She is also notably the co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project.\n\nGinsburg is the court's oldest member and there's been a great deal of speculation on when she may retire. However, she reportedly hired clerks for the term that extends into 2020, indicating she has no plans to leave soon.\n\nIn the past decade, Ginsburg has transformed into something of a liberal icon, earning the nickname \"The Notorious RBG\" and appearing on late night television shows including the \"The Late Show\" with Stephen Colbert, where she showed off her workout routine.\n\nThe justice married Marty Ginsburg in 1954 and the couple attended Harvard Law School together. The pair met on a blind date when she was 17 years old. Marty died from cancer in 2010, at age 78.\n\nIn Ginsburg's absence, the court was proceeding Thursday with a courtroom ceremony welcoming new Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who joined the court last month. President Trump and new acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker were in attendance.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Legendary stuntwoman Kitty O\u2019Neil died Friday in South Dakota at the age of 72, according to multiple reports.\n\nO\u2019Neil was best-known for her work as Lynda Carter\u2019s stunt double on \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d She also worked hit movies such as \u201cThe Blues Brothers\u201d and \u201cSmokey and the Bandit II.\u201d\n\nThe stuntwoman lost her hearing when she was 5 months old after she contracted measles and smallpox, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Dean did say, however, Long may have suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nCALIFORNIA BAR SHOOTING LEAVES 12 DEAD, INCLUDING SHERIFF'S SERGEANT, POLICE SAY\n\nAs Long shot his way into Borderline Bar & Grill on Wednesday night, witnesses said some patrons jumped out of second-floor windows, others used furniture to smash makeshift escape routes and several more people hid in an attic.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the gunman so far.\n\nWho is he?\n\nIan David Long, of Newbury Park, was identified as the shooter by police during a Thursday news conference. Authorities revealed Long had a history of interactions with law enforcement officers.\n\nAmong the incidents, which spanned multiple years, Long was involved in a minor traffic collision, was a victim of a battery at a local bar in 2015 and, in April, deputies were called to his house for a \"subject disturbing.\"\n\n\"[Police] went to the house. They talked to him. He was somewhat irate, acting a little irrationally,\" Dean said, adding a mental health specialist was called to the scene and later cleared Long, who officers declined to arrest. \"He was left at that scene last April.\"\n\nAt that time, given Long was a military veteran, some officers expressed concern he may have been suffering from PTSD, Dean said, though he didn't elaborate on whether PTSD was being investigated as a driving force behind Wednesday's slaughter.\n\nAFTER SHOOTING, DEMS VOW TO TACKLE GUN VIOLENCE\n\nLong served in the Marine Corps from August 2008 through March 2013, when officials say he was honorably discharged. He was a corporal with a specialty as a machine gunner, earning nearly a dozen medals during his service, which included time in Afghanistan, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) confirmed in a statement to Fox News.\n\n\"The Marine Corps extends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims in this senseless tragedy,\" USMC said.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nLong reportedly didn't say a word as he walked into the bar, which was crammed with college students, before he tossed a smoke device and then began firing a Glock .45-caliber handgun -- that sported an illegal modification.\n\nIn California, the handgun is designed to hold 10 rounds and an additional round in the chamber, though Dean noted this particular weapon, which Long purchased legally, had an illegal extended magazine on it. It's unclear how many rounds were actually in the weapon or how many rounds the magazine could hold.\n\nTeylor Whittler, 19, was on the dancefloor when Long opened fire. She told \"FOX & Friends\" Thursday the shooter was wearing black clothes, a black baseball cap and a ski mask-type item partially covering his face.\n\n\u201cThose shots, you don\u2019t mistake that for anything.\" \u2014 Matthew Wennerstrom\n\nHe \u201cknew what he was doing,\" Whittler, the daughter of a military veteran, said. She said it was clear the gunman had experience using weapons.\n\n\"He had two [magazines] that I know with him. He changed them within about six seconds, which was really fast. So he knew what he was doing. And he also had perfect form. When I looked back, he was like spot on,\" Whittler said.\n\nAnother witness, 20-year-old Matthew Wennerstrom \u2014 who described himself as a \"regular\" at the establishment \u2014 told the Los Angeles Times the shooter was \"tall.\" As Wennerstrom fled the horror, he spotted the man about 35 feet away, holding a gun.\n\n\u201cThose shots, you don\u2019t mistake that for anything,\u201d Wennerstrom said, noting he saw the gunman fire at people standing at the front desk before he jumped out of a window to safety.\n\nWhat was his motive?\n\nAuthorities have not yet revealed a motive in the mass shooting.\n\n\"We have no idea what the motive was at this point,\" Dean said at a news conference.\n\nJohn Hedge, who was standing near the front entrance of Borderline Bar & Grill, told KABC he saw the gunman throw smoke devices into the front of the bar before he shot a security guard outside.\n\n\"He was down. The gunman was throwing smoke grenades all over the place. I saw him point to the back of the cash register...and he just kept firing. I ran out the front door,\" he told the news station.\n\nHedge's stepfather told KABC he saw the man shoot the cashier \u2014 a \"young girl\" \u2014 before he turned to the right and headed inside an office.\n\nDean confirmed the witness' account early Thursday.\n\n\"We don't have any other details to confirm an exact chronology about what happened,\" Dean added.\n\nDeputies have secured Long's Newbury Park home and are awaiting a search warrant to enter and continue their investigation.\n\nFox News' Katherine Lam, Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe U.N.'s specially appointed researcher on human rights in Cambodia expressed concern Thursday over the country's use of pre-trial detention and its failure to conduct trials speedily.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the end of an 11-day mission, Rhona Smith specifically expressed concern about people arrested in politically linked cases, including Kem Sokha, the former leader of the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party.\n\nKem Sokha was freed on bail in September after being jailed without trial for a year on a treason charge, but the conditions of his release amount to a form of house arrest.\n\nSmith said a judge denied her request to meet Kem Sokha, and she called for him to be quickly brought to trial or released.\n\n\"Access to justice also requires speedy trials and I am concerned at the time taken to conduct trials and the significant number of people in pre-trial detention,\" Smith said in a statement. \"I repeat my recommendations to use pre-trial detention only when absolutely necessary in accordance with Cambodia criminal procedure code; to carefully document the use of pre-trial detention; and to regularly review the ongoing need in each case.\"\n\nSmith's comments about Cambodia were unusually mild. U.N. human rights investigators are typically highly critical of Cambodia's restrictive political environment and harassment of critics and opponents. She told reporters that for her latest mission in Cambodia, she chose to focus on \"the localization of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals,\" which means broadly addressing how human rights policies can contribute to a nation's overall social and economic development.\n\nCambodia was harshly criticized by many rights groups and Western nations for holding a general election in July that they judged unfair and undemocratic. The election extended the rule of Prime Minister Hun Sen into a fourth decade.\n\nThe only credible opposition force, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was disbanded last year by the courts in a move seen as politically motivated. The 19 other parties that contested the election were seen as either having trivial support or being promoted by the ruling party to foster the illusion of democratic choice.\n\nThe government had already cracked down on the opposition last year as the ruling party's prospects for the general election were looking shaky. The opposition had made a strong showing in 2017 local elections, building on its surprisingly strong challenge in the 2013 general election.\n\nKem Sokha was arrested in September last year on the basis of years-old videos showing him at a seminar where he spoke about receiving advice from U.S. pro-democracy groups. His party denied the treason allegation, calling it politically motivated.", "As news of the mass shooting at a California bar unfolded, several Democrats promised to use their new majority in the House to address gun violence.\n\nAuthorities identified the gunman as 28-year-old Ian David Long, a Marine Corps veteran. Witnesses said he was clad in black clutching a semi-automatic pistol and threw smoke bombs before he opened fire inside Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, late Wednesday night, killing at least 12 people, including a veteran sheriff's sergeant nearing retirement. The gunman was also found dead inside the bar, although it's unclear how he died.\n\nHundreds of people \u2014 including students from California Lutheran University and private Christian school Pepperdine University \u2014 were inside the bar, hosting a country music event, when the shooting occurred.\n\nPresident Trump said he had been briefed on the shooting and praised the \"great bravery shown by police.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA BAR SHOOTING LEAVES 12 DEAD, POLICE SAY\n\nVentura County Sheriff's Office Sgt.

Dianne Feinstein blasted Trump and Republicans for the gun violence that's plagued the nation, particularly in the past few weeks.\n\n\"This failure to act is cowardice of epic proportions. We may not be able to stop all gun violence, but that doesn\u2019t mean Republicans should be allowed to bury their heads in the sand and not try to stop any of it,\" Feinstein said.\n\n\"What we\u2019re lacking is intestinal fortitude from congressional Republicans and President Trump to say enough is enough,\" she continued. \"As long as they stand in fear of the NRA and worry more about the power of the gun lobby than the lives of their fellow citizens, we\u2019ll see more Thousand Oaks, more bodies lying at the foot of failed Republican leadership.\"\n\nEVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT THE GUNMAN SO FAR\n\nFeinstein also maintained that despite California's staunch gun laws, the state can't keep guns coming in from other states \"without stronger laws.\"\n\nHouse Democrats promised to address gun violence in the U.S., especially now that they've gained a majority in the chamber after the midterm elections.\n\n\"Devastated to hear about the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks last night. My condolences to all the victims. I am more committed than ever to addressing the scourge of gun violence,\" California Rep. John Garamendi said.\n\n\"This is not normal,\" said Rep.

We have a responsibility to keep Americans safe. We are failing them,\" Beyer said.\n\nCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, widely seen as a potential 2020 presidential contender, said she's praying for those injured in the shooting and for those who have lost loved ones.

This recipe requires no campfire, just an oven, and there are no long sticks to poke an eye out. And because s'mores are by design gooey and very messy, Sally made these to be eaten with a spoon.

At nearly 7 meters (23 feet) it towers over a nearby monument of the national hero Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, the statesman who led Poland in regaining its independence a century ago.\n\nKaczynski, who was killed in a 2010 plane crash in Russia, was the identical twin of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the right-wing Law and Justice party currently in power.\n\nWhile Poles united in mourning the tragedy that took his life and 95 others, including the first lady, they are deeply divided on whether he deserves such heroic status.\n\nIn another development, the president signed a law late Wednesday that makes next Monday a day off work for Poles since the holiday falls on a Sunday.\n\nPro-business lawmakers and many in the business community say the last-minute organization of a day off is causing disruptions and chaos and warn it will affect their bottom line.", "Minister Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, warned President Donald Trump not to pull \"the trigger of war in the Middle East . at the insistence of Israel,\" speaking Thursday while on a visit to Iran.\n\nThe 85-year-old Farrakhan, long known for provocative comments widely considered anti-Semitic, criticized the economic sanctions leveled by Trump against Iran after America's pullout from the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers.\n\nFarrakhan told journalists in Tehran that he is \"begging our president and the government that supports him to be very, very careful.\"\n\n\"The war will trigger another kind of war which will bring China, Russia, all of the nations into a war,\" he said. \"The war will end America as you know it.\"\n\nFarrakhan leads the Nation of Islam, a black separatist religious movement. The Nation has been largely closed off to outsiders, making it impossible even for those who follow the movement closely to gauge its strength.\n\nFor Farrakhan, the height of his prominence came when he organized the 1995 Million Man March in Washington, a symbol of black pride and empowerment.\n\nEarlier on his trip to Iran, state television published a short video clip of Farrakhan trying to say \"Death to Israel\" in Farsi, a common chant at rallies in the decades after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He began to repeat it, but the crowd at Tehran University sitting at Farrakhan's event then substituted \"America\" for \"Israel,\" drawing laughter.\n\nAfter the video clip spread online, Farrakhan issued a statement saying: \"I never led a chant calling for death to America.\"\n\n\"I asked a question about how to pronounce the chant in Farsi during my meeting with Iranian students and an examination of the video shows just that,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, Farrakhan reacted angrily to an Iranian state television's request to repeat the chant. However, he kept his harshest words for Trump.\n\n\"It is your policies that are eroding trust for you in the world, favor for you in the world, and now you are pulling apart, confused,\" Farrakhan said, addressing Trump. \"If you do this, you will bring about \u2014 not the Iranian chant \u2014 you will bring about the death of the greatest nation that has been on this Earth in the last 6,000 years.\"", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nA Norwegian Navy frigate was rammed by a tanker while it was docked in a harbor on the country's west coast Thursday, the military said. The crew of 127 was evacuated amid fears the ship will sink.\n\nEight people on the KNM Helge Instad were slightly injured when the accident occurred at 4 a.m. local time in Sture, north of Bergen, the Joint Rescue Coordination Center for southern Norway said. The military said the ship, which had recently taken part in the vast NATO drill Trident Juncture, is taking on water.\n\nEirik Walle, with the rescue center, told Norwegian news agency NTB that the collision caused an opening in the frigate's hull and \"it is taking in more water than they can pump out. There is no control over the leak and the stern is heavily in the sea.\"\n\nThe Maltese-flagged tanker, Sola TS, was not damaged and its 23-man crew remained on board.\n\nDetails of the accident were still unclear. Norway's Accident Investigation Board said a towboat was also involved in the accident, but didn't say how.\n\nThe shipping site Sysla said the tanker had been loaded with crude oil and was being towed out of the harbor when it somehow rammed the frigate. The tanker was on its way to Britain, Sysla said.\n\nThe Norwegian Navy has planned a news conference for later in the day.\n\nJohan Marius Ly of the Norwegian Coast Guard said the extent of leakage was unknown.\n\nThe 134-meter (442-foot) long frigate, built in Spain in 2009, has a helipad platform on its stern.\n\nNorway's largest oil and gas company Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, said it shut down non-emergency activities at the Sture terminal where the collision occurred \"as a precautionary measure.\"\n\nSeveral offshore rigs that were pumping their production into the Sture terminal, a major tanker port for crude oil, temporarily suspended the flow, Norwegian newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv reported.\n\nThe Accident Investigation Board added that because the tanker is Maltese-registered, the Marine Safety Investigation Unit (MSIU) of Malta will also participate in the investigation.", "A group of demonstrators gathered outside the White House on Wednesday night to protest the resignation of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nSeveral people were seen holding neon letters spelling out \u201cProtect Mueller\u201d and others held signs saying \u201cTrump is a dictator,\u201d the Hill reported.\n\nHours earlier, Sessions abruptly resigned his position at President Trump\u2019s request.\n\nMatthew Whitaker, Sessions' chief of staff, was announced as acting attorney general. The move worries Democrats because of Whitaker\u2019s previous criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian medaling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"The Acting Attorney General is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice,\" DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told the Hill in a statement.\n\nTrump and Whitaker have repeatedly called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d adding that no crime has been committed and the probe never should have started. Whitaker can hold his new post as the head of the Justice Department for six months without Senate confirmation.\n\nHe will now oversee the Mueller probe and the agency\u2019s other federal investigations. Sessions recused himself from the Mueller investigation, prompting blistering attacks from Trump.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he could fire everyone associated with the special counsel\u2019s office, but wouldn't for political reasons.\n\n\u201cI could fire everybody right now, but I don\u2019t want to stop it because politically I don\u2019t like stopping it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the probe was in \u201cnew and immediate peril.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, a demonstration organized by groups connected with Nobody Is Above the Law Network is expected to take place outside the White House.\n\n\"Donald Trump just crossed a red line, violating the independence of the investigation pursuing criminal charges in the Trump-Russia scandal and cover-up,\" the group says in a statement on its website. \u201cTrump putting himself above the law is a threat to our democracy, and we\u2019ve got to get Congress to stop him.\u201d", "Walter Frankenstein was 14 years old when a police officer came to the Jewish orphanage he was living at in Berlin, urging all children to leave the building immediately because \"something bad will happen tonight.\"\n\nIt was early evening, November 9, 1938. Later that night, he climbed up on the roof of the orphanage and saw fire lighting up the city.\n\n\"Then we knew: the synagogues were burning,\" he said. \"The next morning, when I had to go to school, there was sparkling, broken glass everywhere on the streets.\"\n\nFrankenstein, now 94, was describing Kristallnacht \u2014 the \"Night of Broken Glass\" \u2014 when Nazis, among them many ordinary Germans, terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\nUp to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested, many taken to concentration camps such as Dachau or Buchenwald. Hundreds more committed suicide or died as a result of the mistreatment in the camps years before the official mass deportations began.\n\nAs Germany marked the 80th anniversary of the anti-Jewish pogroms this week with a series of memorial events, Frankenstein returned to the place where he witnessed the violence as a teenager.\n\nOne of the dwindling numbers of Holocaust survivors, Frankenstein needed a walker as he slowly entered the compound where the Auerbach'sches Waisenhaus orphanage once stood. But his memory is still sharp, and he remembers exactly how the events unfolded that night.\n\n\"A few hours after the plainclothes police officer had warned us, a group of men in uniforms came and told us, 'you need to leave now, we want to set fire to the building,'\" Frankenstein said during an interview with The Associated Press this week.\n\nThere would have been no way to take the youngest children to a safe place that quickly, he said. Frankenstein and some of the older boys at the home managed to convince the uniformed men, who belonged to the paramilitary SA, that if they burned down the orphanage the fire would spread to surrounding buildings.\n\n\"So instead, they went into our synagogue and turned off the sanctuary light in front of the holy ark,\" Frankenstein said. \"They did not turn off the gas and after they left, we suddenly could smell gas everywhere inside the building.\" Frankenstein and his peers ran inside the synagogue, tore open all windows, and turned off the gas before it could lead to an explosion.\n\n\"The men probably thought that if enough gas would stream out, the building would blow up,\" he said.\n\nKristallnacht is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust. It would still be years before the Nazis formally adopted their \"Final Solution\" for the Jews of Europe, when boycotts, anti-Semitism legislation and expulsions would evolve into a policy of mass murder. In all, 6 million European Jews were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nGuy Miron, who heads Israel's Yad Vashem's Center for Research on the Holocaust in Germany, said Kristallnacht represented an end to Jewish life in Germany, a point of no return.\n\n\"Until then, the Jews could still try to convince themselves that the wheel could be turned back. After it, the rupture was complete. They realized it was over,\" he said at a Yad Vashem event this week marking the anniversary. \"Before Kristallnacht people emigrated. After it, they fled.\"\n\nStanding under an old poplar tree shedding its bright yellow leaves, Frankenstein gazed at a red brick wall \u2014 the only remainder of the orphanage in the city's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood. The building was badly destroyed during a World War II air raid in 1943, and the ruins were torn down in the 1950s.\n\nThe wall was turned into a memorial for those Jewish orphans who did not survive the Holocaust, with the names and ages of 140 children inscribed on the bricks. The youngest one, Cilla Fuks, was ten months old when she was murdered.\n\nFrankenstein was one of the few who survived. In 1943 he went into hiding with his wife Leonie, whom he had met at the orphanage, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.\n\n\"We had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\" he said, still feisty after all these years. \"So we went into hiding.\"\n\nTogether with their newborn son Uri, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run.\n\nIn 1945, after the collapse of the Nazis' Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then still Palestine. Eleven years later, in 1956, they moved from Israel to Sweden where they settled for good.\n\nNowadays, Walter Frankenstein returns to Germany several times a year. He often talks to schoolchildren about his life and on Friday, the anniversary of November 9, 1938, he will be honored in an award-giving ceremony by Germany's Culture Minister Monika Gruetters.\n\nIn 2014, he received Germany's highest civil honor, the Federal Cross of Merit.\n\nEvery time Frankenstein travels to Berlin, he brings along the small blue case containing the cross. Inside the case's lid, he has attached the first \"mark\" he got from the Germans: The Yellow Badge, or Jewish Star, that he had to wear during the Nazi reign to identify him as a Jew.\n\n\"The first one marked me, the second one honored me,\" he said as he slowly closed the lid.", "Washington state is on track to become one of the strictest states in the U.S. on gun laws.\n\nInitiative 1639, a sweeping measure to beef up gun-regulations, passed Tuesday with 60 percent of the vote, Seattle's Q13 Fox reported.\n\nSEATTLE GUN STORAGE LAW 'EMINENTLY REASONABLE,' JUDGE SAYS IN TOSSING NRA, GUN GROUP'S LAWSUIT\n\nCampaign Manager Stephen Paolini, 22, said the measure\u2019s passing sends \u201ca message to our elected officials: Enough is enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy generation has been defined by gun violence.

Purchasers must take a safety training course and must wait 10 business days from the date a licensed dealer requested the background check.

John J. Pershing, who had been bent on continuing the fighting, even had to explain to Congress the high number of last-day losses.\n\nBefore Nov. 11, the war had killed 14 million people, including 9 million soldiers, sailors and airmen from 28 countries. Germany came close to a quick, early victory before the war settled into hellish trench fighting. One battle, like the Somme in France, could have up to 1 million casualties. The use of poison gas came to epitomize the ruthlessness of warfare that the world had never seen.\n\nDeath on the final morning added another twist to the cruelty.\n\nIn northeastern France's Meuse-Argonne, a 23-year-old American, Henry Gunther, was killed by German machine-gun fire one minute before the armistice.\n\n\"His time of death was 10:59 A.M. which is just so haunting,\" U.S. historian Alec Bennett said. Gunther still charged a German machine gun nest, when keeping his head down for a few dozen more seconds could have saved him. It remains a mystery why he did it.\n\n\"Gunther's act is seen as almost a symbol of the futility of the larger war,\" Bennett said.\n\nOther nations also were not spared such casualties.\n\nWith two minutes to go, Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was shot by a German sniper close to Mons in southern Belgium, some 250 kilometers (150 miles) from where Gunther died. It served no apparent purpose but another life was shattered in its prime at 25.\n\n\"It really was one man, here and there, who was driven by vengeance, by a need to kill one last time,\" Belgian historian Corentin Rousman said.\n\nAnd Trebuchon, 40, also was shot minutes before the cease-fire. He was running to tell his comrades where and when they would have a meal after the armistice.\n\nThe three are considered their nations' last men to fall in active combat.\n\n___\n\nPhotojournalist Virginia Mayo and videojournalist Mark Carlson contributed reporting.\n\n___\n\nFor more information on World War I, go to The Associated Press' WWI hub: https://www.apnews.com/WorldWarI\n\n___\n\nWorld War I: An AP Centennial Commemorative Edition.

Doctors Without Borders, meanwhile, said it was treating two dozen wounded from the latest offensive.\n\nThe push against the Iran-backed rebels also known as Houthis who are holding Hodeida began anew this month, shortly after the United States called for a cease-fire by the end of the month.\n\nApparently in a rush to try to take Hodeida before then, coalition artillery, helicopter gunships and airstrikes have pounded the rebels since then, with dozens killed on both sides. The rebels admit they are outnumbered but have vowed to fight on.\n\nCease-fires in Yemen's civil war have rarely held, and peace talks have repeatedly broken down in the past.\n\nAmnesty urged the warring sides to protect civilians. It said that the coalition, which relies heavily on air power, has killed scores of civilians in recent airstrikes, and rebels are responding with mortars in residential neighborhoods that cause indiscriminate casualties.\n\n\"The presence of Houthi fighters on the hospital's roof violates international humanitarian law,\" said Amnesty's Samah Hadid, adding that \"this violation does not make the hospital and the patients and medical staff lawful targets\" for the coalition.\n\nHadid said the hospital was full of wounded \"civilians who have nowhere else to go for lifesaving medical care.

The Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the rebels since 2015, in an attempt to restore that government to power.\n\nIn recent days, fighting intensified with troops trained by the United Arab Emirates, a coalition member, advanced in eastern Hodeida, pushing toward the city's port and key Red Sea facilities, some 5 kilometers (3 miles) away.\n\nDoctors Without Borders reported an influx of wounded civilians in recent days, with 24 wounded, including women and children from Hodeida, with mostly blast and gunshot injuries.\n\nThe aid group, known under its French acronym MSF, said civilians were reported leaving Hodeida over the weekend but that it was difficult to assess how many remained trapped inside.\n\nThe Saudi-backed Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi appointed a new defense minister to fill a role that had been empty for several years, naming Mohammed al-Maqdishi for the post, according to the state SABA news agency late Wednesday.

Long's body was found in an office near the entrance of the bar.\n\nSheriff Geoff Dean, who is set to retire on Friday, said Long may have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and was known to law enforcement officials due to several unspecified \"contacts\" stretching back multiple years. Long served in the Marine Corps from August 2008 to March 2013, with a deployment in Afghanistan between November 2010 and June 2011, military records show.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had several contacts with Mr. Long over the years, minor events such as a traffic collision. He was a victim of a battery in a bar in 2015,\u201d Dean said, adding that the bar in 2015 was a different establishment than Borderline.\n\nDean said the last interaction between Long and authorities occurred in April, when police officers were called to Long's house in Newbury Park, about five miles from Borderline, after reports of a disturbance. When they arrived, officers found Long \"irate and acting irrationally,\" leading to a crisis intervention team being summoned. The team, however, cleared Long and said they didn't feel he was qualified to be taken into custody.\n\n\u201cObviously, he had something going on in his head that would cause him to do something like this. Obviously, he had some sort of issue,\u201d Dean said of Long.\n\nAs for why he attacked the bar, \"there's no indication that he targeted the employees. We haven't found any correlation,\" the sheriff said. \"Maybe there was a motive for this particular night, but we have no information leading to that at all.\"\n\nLong opened fire inside Borderline about 11:20 p.m., during the bar's \"college country night\" event, authorities said. Dean said it appears Long shot the unarmed security guard first, turned to the right to shoot other security and staff members before opening fire on the rest of the patrons. No one at the venue was armed.\n\nAbout 150 to 200 people \u2014 including 16 students from private Christian school Pepperdine University, along with others from California Lutheran University and California State University Channel Islands \u2014 were inside Borderline when witnesses said Long tossed a smoke device into the crowd and then, amid the confusion, fired at least 30 shots.\n\nDeputies and highway patrolmen arrived at the bar within minutes of receiving multiple 911 calls and began assessing the grim, gruesome situation, Sheriff Geoff Dean said during an earlier Thursday news conference.\n\n\u201cIt is a horrific scene in there. There is blood everywhere,\u201d Dean said. He later described it as \"hell.\"\n\nSheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, a veteran of 29 years, arrived first on the scene and immediately entered the bar with a patrolman after hearing gunfire. But as the two made their way inside, Helus was shot several times. The patrolman pulled the sergeant from the line of fire, and Helus was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead early Thursday.\n\n\"Ron was a hardworking, dedicated sheriff sergeant,\" Dean said while holding back tears. \"He was totally committed. He gave his all. And tonight, as I told his wife, he died a hero because he went in to save lives. To save other people.\"\n\nWitnesses inside the bar -- which bills itself as \"Ventura County's largest country dance hall and live music venue\" -- told reporters how some patrons used chairs to break windows in a bid to escape the chaos while others scrambled between shots to hide in the establishment's attic. Dean said people also hid in the attic, bathroom and under tables to escape the hail of bullets.\n\nThere were six off-duty officers at the bar that night.\n\n\"It's just amazing. There were probably six off-duty officers in there from a couple different agencies and I've already talked to a parent who said they stood in front of my daughter,\" Dean said.\n\nOne other person suffered a \"minor gunshot\" wound, while 15 to 20 people were injured by jumping through windows and diving under tables, according to the sheriff. Pepperdine University officials said two of its students were treated for injuries and released. One student who was at the bar remains unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cWe all just kind of froze for a split second and then everyone booked it and dove to the floor,\" said Teylor Whittler, who was on the dance floor when the shooting started. \"After the first round it was quiet for about five seconds, and then some guys who were next to me on the floor got up and started sprinting toward the back door and yelled at everyone, \u2018Get up! Run! He\u2019s coming!\u201d\n\nWhittler, a daughter of a military veteran, told \"Fox & Friends\" she was at the bar celebrating a friend's 21st birthday when shots rang out. She said of the 11 people she was with, there are still five friends who she hasn't heard from yet. She recalled getting trampled on and hit in the head with a barstool when patrons made a dash to the door. A man eventually pulled her up and helped her escape.\n\nShe described the gunman as wearing all black clothes, a black baseball cap and a ski mask-type item partially covering his face. Several other witnesses offered a similar description, telling reporters the tall gunman first shot at a bouncer working the bar's door and then opened fire -- seemingly at random -- at those inside.\n\nWhittler said the gunman \u201cknew what he was doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I was inside I would say [I heard]\u2026about a good 30 seconds [of gunshots]\u2026he had two [magazines] that I know with him.

A lot of my friends survived Route 91. If they survived that, they\u2019ll survive this.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump said he was briefed on the \"terrible shooting\" and offered his condolences to the 12 people who died.\n\n\u201cI have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California.

FAA directives are usually followed by other airline regulators internationally.\n\nThe FAA said erroneous data from the \"angle of attack\" sensor, which helps prevent the plane from stalling and diving, could cause flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane and lead to \"excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with the terrain.\"\n\nThe directive instructs airlines to make specific changes to flight manual procedures for responding to the problem. Boeing's bulletin said it was directing flight crews to existing guidelines.\n\nIndonesian investigators on Wednesday said the sensor was replaced on the Lion Air plane the day before its fatal flight and may have compounded other problems with the aircraft.\n\nThe 2-month-old Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta. Both that flight and its Oct. 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta had erratic speed and altitude shortly after takeoff.\n\nIndonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee earlier this week announced the plane had a malfunctioning airspeed indicator on its last four flights, based on analysis of the flight data recorder. Chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono said the airspeed indicator and sensor problems are related.\n\nLion Air's first two attempts to address the airspeed problem didn't work, and for the jet's second-to-last flight the \"angle of attack\" sensors were replaced, Tjahjono said.\n\nOn that Oct. 28 flight, from Bali to Jakarta, the pilot's and copilot's sensors disagreed by about 20 degrees. The plane went into a sudden dive minutes after takeoff, from which the pilots were able to recover. They decided to fly on to Jakarta at a lower-than-normal altitude.\n\nOn the fatal flight, the plane hit the water at very high speed after the flight crew had been cleared to return to the airport several minutes after takeoff.\n\n\"The point is that after the AOA (sensor) is replaced, the problem is not solved but the problem might even increase. Is this fatal? NTSC wants to explore this,\" Tjahjono said.\n\nAirline safety experts said pilots are trained to handle a plane safely if those crucial sensors fail and backup systems are generally in place as well.\n\nThere are audio signals and physical warnings that can alert the pilot to malfunctioning equipment or other dangers, said Todd Curtis, director of the Airsafe.com Foundation.\n\n\"They should have been completely engaged in what was going on inside that cockpit, and any kind of warning that came up, they would have been wise to pay attention to it,\" Curtis said.\n\nInvestigators are likely focused on how a single sensor's failure resulted in a faulty command that didn't take into account information from a second sensor, said John Cox, CEO of Safety Operating Systems.\n\n\"We don't know what the crew knew and didn't know yet,\" Cox said. \"We will.\"\n\nIndonesia's search and rescue agency has extended the search until Sunday.

Late Wednesday, before the judge's ruling, he called the charges a \"farce\" but said he was more worried about Ecuador's future than his own legal troubles.\n\n\"We expected something like this because for weeks we've been witnesses to the uncontrolled political pressure being applied to the judge,\" Caupolican Ochoa, Correa's attorney, said outside the court where a small group of Correa supporters had gathered.\n\nBalda said he took no pleasure in the legal victory because \"we can't celebrate the fact that these criminal acts were ordered by a president.\"\n\nCorrea, a firebrand who governed Ecuador with an iron fist for a decade, garnered legions of supporters by promoting generous health and social programs aimed at reducing inequality. Supporters credit him with providing Ecuador political and economic stability after a tumultuous period in the nation's history.\n\nBut the combative leader also feuded with the media, business community, indigenous groups and environmentalists by pushing through measures that consolidated executive power. And his record has increasingly come under scrutiny since leaving power.\n\nIn addition to the kidnapping case, several top aides, including his former Vice President Jorge Glas, have either been jailed or are under investigation for corruption.\n\nBalda was abducted but quickly escaped harm after nearby taxi drivers alerted police, who stopped the vehicle in which he was being taken away. Colombian authorities later determined that three intelligence agents with Ecuador's police had contracted the kidnappers to abduct Balda.\n\nProceedings against Correa are unlikely to begin anytime soon because he can only be tried once in Ecuador.

Accommodating religious objections has been a sticking point with conservatives for years, and was the subject of legal challenges.\n\nThe new regulations apply mainly to religious organizations, nonprofits and small businesses. Women's rights groups already suing the administration over an earlier version of the opt-out vowed to continue their court battle.\n\n\"The religious and moral exemptions provided by these rules also apply to institutions of education, issuers, and individuals. The Departments are not extending the moral exemption to publicly traded businesses, or either exemption to government entities,\" HHS said in a statement.\n\nThe rule, set to take effect after a 60-day comment period, does not bar any employer from providing contraceptive coverage.\n\nStarting next year, the new Democratic majority in the House is expected to scrutinize the administration policies on women's health.\n\nAnd while Republicans -- who had suggested prior to Tuesday's midterms that repealing ObamaCare entirely might be possible if the GOP had held onto the House -- cannot take another realistic crack at completely dismantling Obama's health care law for the next two years, they can encourage the president to take additional executive action to weaken its effectiveness.\n\nDEMS' HOUSE TAKEOVER SETS UP LEGISLATIVE SHOWDOWN ON PERSCRIPTION DRUGS, TAXES, OBAMACARE\n\n\u201cNo American should be forced to violate his or her own conscience in order to abide by the laws and regulations governing our health care system,\u201d HHS press secretary Caitlin Oakley said when the rollback was announced last year.\n\nTrump's administration has broadened narrower exemptions and workarounds than Obama permitted, moves favored by social conservatives who are staunch supporters of the president.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the administration proposed tighter rules on ObamaCare plans that cover abortion. The administration said those changes are intended to ensure that taxpayer-provided subsidies for health insurance are not used to pay for abortions.\n\nThe vast majority of employers offer birth control benefits through their health plans. Large companies whose stock is sold to investors won't be eligible for the opt-out, and neither will governmental employers.\n\nIt's unclear how many women will be affected by the new policy.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "CNN's Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass to access the White House was suspended \"until further notice\" Wednesday, hours after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with President Trump.\n\n\"I've just been denied entrance to the WH,\" Acosta tweeted Wednesday night. \"Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed Acosta's tweet in a statement, claiming the suspension of his press credentials stemmed from his \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\" She called the behavior \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nCNN'S JIM ACOSTA STRUGGLES WITH WHITE HOUSE AIDE TO KEEP MICROPHONE DURING TESTY TRUMP EXCHANGE\n\nThe CNN reporter, during a news conference at the White House earlier Wednesday, got into a heated debate with Trump after he asked the president about the migrant caravan.

Others are arriving after failing to complete the trip and are being ferried back to the precarious lives they left behind.\n\nHundreds of the mostly Honduran migrants who set out with the caravan that has traversed hundreds of miles through three countries before arriving in Mexico City this week have returned home, according to the Mexican government. Some grew disillusioned. Others simply wore out. Still others were detained and returned, or gave up on waiting for possible asylum in Mexico and accepted bus rides back home.\n\nDisembarking at the bus station in San Pedro Sula, nearly all of those returning said the same thing: Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but they intend to try again.\n\n\"I would go 30 times more if possible,\" said Daniel Castaneda, an 18-year-old from the central city of Comayagua. He was detained shortly after migrants in a caravan following in the footsteps of the first one clashed with police on a bridge on the Mexican border with Guatemala late last month.\n\n\"I can't say when, but I am going to keep going. ... This country is going to be left empty,\" he said.\n\nReny Maudiel a fresh-faced 16-year-old in a green T-shirt, a mop of curly hair sticking skyward from his head, said he was turned off by the violence of last month's border clashes. He was also exhausted, and his feet hurt \u2014 but already his mind was turning northward.\n\n\"I hope another opportunity emerges,\" he said.\n\nWhile U.S. President Donald Trump seized on the caravan as a campaign issue for Tuesday's midterm elections and suggested that criminals had infiltrated the group, the migrants say they are fleeing poverty, lack of jobs and rampant violence.\n\nIn a country that is one of the world's deadliest by homicide rates, San Pedro Sula is among the most violent cities as the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13 street gang, fights street-by-street with the rival 18th Street gang for territory. It's also seen a harsh crackdown by security forces including documented abuses.

A trained veterinarian, he ended up selling tamales cooked by his landlady, and it wasn't nearly enough to support his family.\n\nMexican authorities say some 3,230 migrants from the caravan have requested refuge. Alba used to be one of them. But shut in at an immigration center and unable to communicate with his children \u2014 he had no money or cell phone \u2014 he dropped his application and agreed to return to Honduras. Some 480 others have done the same, according to the Mexican government.\n\nHe intends to try again in March \u2014 only this time he will bring his kids.\n\nAccording to data from Mexico's National Immigration Institute, on average 136 Honduran migrants per day have been returned to their country this year.

In interviews with The Associated Press, most returnees said they faced only a bleak future if they remained in Honduras.\n\nHowever, some, like Gerardo Castillo, a 35-year-old mason, did find encouragement in promises by Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, to give special visas to Central Americans to work in his country.\n\nCastillo, who left two children back home in Olancho and has two more in the United States, complained that immigration agents under the current Mexican administration were detaining migrants who separated from the main caravan, as happened to him.

When it became clear she wasn't getting better they decided to return to their Honduran hometown of El Paraiso on the border with Nicaragua.\n\nHe sold his cellphone to raise a bit of money and had little more than a donated green backpack he picked up after crossing into Mexico.\n\nBut his plans were clear. \"To rest for a while, and in January, another caravan,\" he said.\n\nRumors that yet more caravans will form are flying in every corner of Honduras. They're attractive for the perception that they provide safety in numbers, and because they're a way to avoid paying thousands of dollars to a smuggler.\n\nBut the reality is far less certain.\n\nThose few who make it to the United States face a tough road to be able to stay legally; poverty and violence are not supposed to be considered as qualifying factors for asylum.

Sessions is expected to leave the Justice Department by the end of the day, and Whitaker is expected to take over immediately.\n\nIn his resignation letter, Sessions said he was \u201chonored to serve\u201d as attorney general and said his Justice Department \u201crestored and upheld the rule of law \u2013 a glorious tradition that each of us has a responsibility to safeguard.\u201d\n\nSessions' departure from the Justice Department was not unexpected, as the president has signaled that there would be changes to his administration after the midterms. But no one faced more rumors of an imminent dismissal than Sessions.\n\nFor more than a year, Trump has repeatedly lambasted Sessions over his recusal, saying he wouldn\u2019t have installed him as the country\u2019s top law enforcement officer had he known his attorney general would recuse himself from the Russia probe.\n\nIn September, Trump said of his strained relationship with Sessions, \u201cI don\u2019t have an attorney general. It\u2019s very sad.\u201d\n\nIn March 2017, shortly after taking office, Sessions removed himself from the Russia investigation, citing his involvement as a high-profile surrogate and adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nThe investigation into the Russian government\u2019s attempted meddling in the election has dogged the president since he took office. Trump and his aides have denied any collusion with the Russians.\n\nSources told Fox News Whitaker will now be overseeing the Russia investigation. However, Justice Department ethics officials have not yet determined whether he will be able to hold that responsibility, or whether he may also have to recuse himself from the investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Special Counsel Robert Mueller was informed before the Sessions announcement.\n\nDemocrats expressed alarm after the announcement. Upon hearing the news of Sessions\u2019 resignation, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that \u201cprotecting Mueller and his investigation is paramount.\u201d\n\nHe also called on Whitaker to remove himself from the Russia probe.\n\n\u201cGiven his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\u201d Schumer said in a statement.\n\nThe Democratic leader of the House Judiciary Committee called for \u201canswers immediately as to the reasoning\u201d behind Sessions\u2019 removal. His statement comes a day after Democrats retook the House, giving them the power to launch investigations.\n\n\u201cWhy is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation?\u201d New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler tweeted. \u201cWe will be holding people accountable.\u201d\n\nBefore he took a job at the Justice Department, Whitaker wrote an op-ed saying Mueller \u201cis dangerously close to crossing\u201d a \u201cred line\u201d in the Russia probe if he looked at Trump or his family\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cIt does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else,\u201d Whitaker wrote. \u201cThat goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\u201d\n\nIn March 2017, Sessions announced his plans to recuse himself after reports surfaced detailing undisclosed conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign. Sessions has said he was acting in his capacity as a Republican senator from Alabama.\n\nAt the time of his recusal, Sessions said he met with the \u201crelevant senior career department officials\u201d to discuss the issue.\n\n\u201cHaving concluded those meetings today, I have decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein then took control of the investigation and decided to appoint Mueller to take over the probe.\n\nSessions\u2019 former Senate colleagues on Wednesday praised him for his service.\n\n\u201cI thank Jeff Sessions for his dedicated service as attorney general,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said. \"Throughout his career, as a prosecutor, a senator and as attorney general, he remained steadfast in his commitment to the rule of law and his love of our great nation. I wish him well and look forward to working with him in any future endeavors.\u201d\n\nSessions also had his critics -- especially from civil libertarians and others who disagreed with his hardline stance against illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cJeff Sessions was the worst attorney general in modern American history,\u201d American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony D. Romero said Wednesday.\n\nTrump\u2019s falling out with Sessions was remarkable, considering the pivotal and trusted role the Alabama Republican played for Trump during the campaign.\n\nSessions -- who bonded with Trump over their populist views on trade and immigration -- became the first sitting senator to endorse Trump in February 2016 when he announced his support of the New York businessman\u2019s then-underdog campaign.\n\nThe endorsement was seen as a blow to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump\u2019s conservative rival in the Republican race whose path to victory included a strong performance in Southern states. Trump won Alabama.\n\nSessions went on to become one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken and prominent surrogates during the campaign. A number of Sessions\u2019 top staffers \u2013 including Rick Dearborn and Stephen Miller \u2013 took senior White House roles. When other Republicans abandoned Trump after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape just days before the general election, Sessions stood by Trump.\n\nAfter Trump won the White House, Sessions, who faced no opposition in his 2014 re-election to the Senate, gave up a safe seat to become Trump\u2019s attorney general.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Sessions denied accusations from Democrats that he had made racially insensitive statements in the past. Though most Democrats voted against their former colleague, his confirmation was seen as redemption for Sessions, whose nomination for a 1986 federal judgeship was rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time.\n\nAs attorney general, Sessions cracked down on illegal immigration, vowing to enforce federal law.\n\nFox News' John Roberts and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "A $5 million lawsuit brought about by two McDonald\u2019s customers in Florida was thrown out last week by U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas, granting a motion filed by McDonald\u2019s.\n\nJudge Dimitrouleas dismissed the lawsuit last Friday \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d Miami Herald reported, meaning the plaintiffs are not allowed to file the lawsuit again at a later date.\n\nKANYE WEST SAYS MCDONALD'S IS HIS FAVORITE RESTAURANT DESPITE REPORTEDLY OWNING BURGER KING FRANCHISES LICENSES\n\nIn May, the South Florida couple, Cynthia Kissner and Leonard Werner, filed the suit complaining they had been charged the full price of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese, even though they requested the burger not have cheese.\n\nKissner and Werner argued that hamburgers and cheeseburgers are different prices on the McDonald\u2019s menu, but when they order a Quarter Pounder without the extra dairy, they\u2019re still forced to pay the same amount.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, McDonald\u2019s used to sell four different Quarter Pounder options, two of which came without cheese and cost between 30 to 90 cents less, the Miami Herald reported.

You shouldn\u2019t treat people that way,\u201d Trump continued.\n\nAlexander defended Acosta calling him a \u201cdiligent reporter who busts his butt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not a big fan of yours either, to be honest,\u201d Trump told Alexander. \"I understand,\u201d Alexander responded.\n\nAcosta then tried to say something to Trump again, but the president told him to sit down.\n\n\u201cWhen you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe exchange drew a lot of strong reaction, including from Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace and Todd Starnes.\n\n\u201cI have to say Acosta\u2019s behavior was shameful,\u201d Wallace said of the reporter\u2019s exchange with Trump.\n\nHe said he has never seen anything like Acosta\u2019s fiery exchange with Trump.\n\nCNN released a statement shortly after the press conference saying Trump\u2019s attack on the press had \u201cgone too far.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis president\u2019s ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far. They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American. While President Trump has made it clear he does not respect a free press, he has a sworn obligation to protect it. A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere,\u201d CNN said.\n\nAcosta tweeted his thanks to Alexander and retweeted a photo of the aide attempting to take the microphone from him.\n\nHours after the exchange between Trump and the CNN reporter, Acosta's press pass to access the White House was suspended.\n\nAcosta tweeted: \"I've just been denied entrance to the WH. Secret Service just informed me I cannot enter the WH grounds for my 8pm hit.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed the decision on Twitter, saying the pass would be suspended \"until further notice.\"", "Jake Gibson, Fox News Channel Producer for the DOJ, joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie after breaking the news of Jeff Sessions' resignation.\n\nOn how he found out Sessions was resigning: I woke up this morning and thought well I guess this could be the day for Jeff sessions, but I really didn't think it would be the day. Upon being reminded I do remember that I was around and working in Washington the day after the midterms I believe it was '06 was Don Rumsfeld was canned by President George W. Bush, so this does happen. I thought it would be a few more days and then learned in the middle of the day that this was going to happen very soon and we all rushed to get it onto TV and we were first. (00:38)\n\nOn the process of confirming a story like this: I got the letter and then I was told that it would probably be Whitaker but that couldn't be from the source that was giving me the letter. So I went to John Roberts and said, \"Look this is happening. Can you get Whitaker?' and he did and we knew we were good. I mean I knew we were good before that, but we also wanted to have that additional piece and John, once he was comfortable, he went on TV with it. (1:36)\n\nOn what the mood is like at the DOJ: I mean among the people who are close with him they're sad. There were some tears out there by the people who work with him every day, some of the press people who work with him every day, not reporters but his press staff who deals with us were choked up. (2:42)", "I was actually on Fox News Channel on Election night when the channel\u2019s Decision Desk called the House of Representatives for the Democrats. What fortuitous timing!\n\nAnchor Martha MacCallum asked me how I felt and \u201cI\u2019m so relieved\u201d came flying out of my mouth.\n\nRelief was the overwhelming sentiment I heard from my fellow Democrats about Tuesday\u2019s midterm election results. Just like in 2016, the exit polls looked good for us: Health care was the number one issue by miles and Democrats have led on the issue by double digits for months.\n\nGuns were the fourth most important issue, another winner for my party.\n\nTrump\u2019s approval numbers with women were terrible with only 39 percent of women giving him a positive approval rating and 60 percent of women giving him a disapproval rating. Three-quarters of voters 18-29 broke for Democrats on Tuesday night with well over a million new registrants in that age range.\n\nNearly half of voters thought Trump\u2019s immigration policies were too tough and that the new tax law has had no impact on their personal finances.\n\nLooks like the making of a good night. But history has told us to be cautious and rightfully so as we ended up losing more Senate seats than planned and very emotional gubernatorial races in Florida and Ohio. Although holding on to Tester\u2019s seat in Montana on Wednesday was a senate silver lining, losing three of our red state senators was a tough pill to swallow.\n\nDespite those losses, which are tough to stomach, Democrats accomplished a tremendous amount last night. We flipped at least 29 House seats, seven governors\u2019 seats, one Senate seat, four GOP super-majorities in state legislatures were broken, an astounding 330 state legislative seats and three state Supreme Court seats were flipped, too.\n\nWe did this by campaigning on our values of equality and diversity. Just look at who we elected:\n\nThe first African-American women to represent Massachusetts and Connecticut in Congress\n\nThe first Muslim women to serve in the House\n\nThe first Latinas in the House from Texas\n\nThe first Native American women in the House\n\nThe first Native American woman elected statewide in Minnesota\n\nThe first openly gay governor elected in the country\n\nSince Trump\u2019s election, thousands of stories have been written about the political mobilization of women whether running for office, getting involved locally, marching, phone banking or even just dressing their babies up as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg aka \u201cRBG\u201d for Halloween.\n\nUnlike 2016, female voters did not let us down on Election Day. White women broke evenly between Democrats and Republicans whereas 55 percent of them had supported Trump in 2016. And overall, 59 percent of women backed Democrats. And they propelled a spate of female candidates to higher office.\n\nNineteen of our 29+ House seats are held by women. And we expanded the number of female Democratic governors from two to at least six with wins by Laura Kelly of Kansas, Janet Mills of Maine, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.\n\nTrump\u2019s backing surely helped in key Senate races like Indiana and Missouri. That\u2019s undeniable. But it should also be noted that at least 32 Trump backed candidates lost last night. That\u2019s not a small number.\n\nLeading Democratic figures have been telling us for months what was at stake Tuesday and Democrats showed up to ensure that social security is safe, Medicare is safe, the ACA is safe and that there will be no more tax cuts for the one percent.\n\nWe will now have a better chance at fair redistricting. Voters in six states approved proposals to protect victims of crimes. One and a half million Floridians who were convicted felons will now have their right to vote restored. The minimum wage is going up in Arkansas and Missouri. Three states expanded Medicaid. The legalization of marijuana continues across the country.\n\nWe voted our values on Tuesday and it paid off. Rest assured we will continue to fight over the next two years until we take back 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, too.", "Fox News Senior Producer For Capitol Hill Chad Pergram joined Fox News Radio's Guy Benson and Marie Harf to give insight into what is happening on Capitol Hill the day after the election.\n\nOn what he is hearing about what Democratic leadership in the House might look like: Let's start with Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader and the prospective Speaker. Let's put this in historical context if she's going to return to the Speaker suite we have not had a Speaker return after they've been out of power since the early 1950's. Sam Rayburn from Texas had three separate stints as Speaker and so he came back not once, but twice, as Speaker, the most recent in the 1950's. The person who he toggled back and forth with was Joe Martin, a Republican Speaker from Massachusetts who did it twice himself. If Pelosi in fact wins and comes back that's a little bit different. That has not happened in a long time. (1:16)\n\nOn multiple people running for Speaker: That would be very bloody. We have not done that in the House of Representatives having a multi-ballot vote for Speaker since 1923. Speaker Gillet of Massachusetts was the one who was the last Speaker to go through a multi-vote ballot and he ultimately prevailed in the House of Representatives. Here's the thing I do know about Nancy Pelosi. She's a really good vote counter, without question the best on Capitol Hill whether she is in the majority or minority and if she doesn't think that she has the votes we will know because she will know and she will probably figure out some way to exit. (5:00)\n\nOn on the Republican side: You could always have recriminations there because they lost the control of the House. It certainly helps Republicans that when you have two top leadership positions, Minority Leader and Minority Whip, it's easier that Paul Ryan, the Speaker, is going away. So, that kind of opens the door for Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise. (9:33)\n\nOn reaction on the Hill to Sessions resigning: I think people thought it might happen, but it was just a matter of when it might happen and that was the key right there the fact that it was coming at this point in time, the day after the election when we were still sorting through what the midterms meant and who is going to be the Speaker of the House and then boom that this takes the next step. That was the problem.

It's never been like this,\" Lisa, a registered independent, told Fox News. \"People are getting over-emotional.\"\n\nMcGovern said the incident was especially \"frightening\" because it was so close to their home, but she said it was amusing to find out it was a local professor.\n\n\"I kind of thought it was funny in a way, because of the times, you hear about stories of the professors being very liberal and not allowing people with conservative or Republican views to speak...almost like trying to shut down my voice, which seems antithetical to what a professor should be doing because we should all have a voice,\" McGovern said.\n\nEbert said she was caught in a moment of weakness and high emotion and meant no harm to McGovern nor did she know she lived there.\n\nSOME TEACHERS VIEWED TRUMP'S WIN AS 'THREAT TO STUDENTS' SAFETY, LIVELIHOOD', STUDY SAYS\n\n\"I have family I love that support Trump, so I was after the sign, not the person,\" Ebert told Campus Reform. \"I have apologized and feel bad, but clearly the GOP is putting a big deal [of] spin on this. Many signs have been taken and disfigured, which, while no excuse for my bad behavior, doesn't warrant the death threats I have received...Nor the smear campaign after me...\"\n\nAccording to the police report, Ebert is set to appear in court November 13, and it is unclear whether she stole more signs in other areas.\n\nUNIVERSITY OFFICIAL 'REGRETS' SENDING ANTI-TRUMP EMAIL TO STUDENTS AHEAD OF MIDTERM ELECTION\n\nThere are several negative reviews on RateMyProfessor.com about how \"unorganized\" and \"all over the place\" Ebert is. Many said she was their worst professor they'd taken at SUNY New Paltz, but many noted she is a nice person.\n\n\"I'm sure she's not a bad person but she just acted irrationally,\" McGovern said. \"I think it's actually kind of a representation of what's happening in our country right now, that people on both sides are dug in on their side and doing things without thinking.\"\n\nHer incident came weeks after community members in the same town rallied around an American flag mural targeted by protesters who are now trying to boycott the pizza shop responsible for putting it up and was vandalized Monday night.\n\nSMALL TOWN RALLIES IN SUPPORT OF AMERICAN FLAG MURAL AFTER INITIAL OUTCRY\n\n\"My husband said I'm not allowed to buy pizza anywhere else,\" McGovern joked. \"I felt like it was a little over-the-top that people were saying it is offensive. It's a symbol of our country. It's non-political and for people in a small town trying to get a small business shut down is a little outrageous. People should be supporting small business, not trying to get them shut down.\"\n\nThe university did not immediately respond to request for comment.", "The Republican party's expanded Senate majority will smooth the way for President Trump\u2019s judicial nominees who have been lined up in the bullpen for nearly two years awaiting confirmation - and offers a clearer path for a third Supreme Court pick should the opportunity arise before 2020.\n\nAfter a heated midterm election season, Democrats comfortably secured the majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2011. Republicans meanwhile increased their Senate control with at least a 52-46 margin by Wednesday afternoon, flipping several critical seats in the process, including wins by Josh Hawley over two-term Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.; Rep. Kevin Cramer over incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D.; and Mike Braun over incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind.\n\nBut the GOP Senate majority could still grow\u2014with two seats still up for grabs.\n\nFULL MIDTERM RESULTS\n\nThe historic Arizona Senate race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally has still not been called hours after polls closed. The two female lawmakers are vying for the soon-to-be vacant seat of Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., who will retire this year.\n\nIn Mississippi, the seat will not be decided until Nov. 27, when the state holds a runoff election between Republican incumbent Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democratic challenger Mike Espy. Mississippi saw a four-way race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Thad Cochran. Espy and Hyde-Smith were tied with 41 percent of the vote, with the other Republican candidate, Chris McDaniel, lagging well behind with 16 percent. The fourth candidate, Democrat Tobey Bernard Bartee had just 1 percent of the vote.\n\nBecause Hyde-Smith split the GOP vote with McDaniel, her chances of being victorious over Espy later this month are high.\n\nTRUMP TOUTS SENATE GAINS COMPARED WITH OBAMA'S FIRST MIDTERMS, SAYS REPUBLICANS 'DEFIED HISTORY'\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., acknowledged that the heated confirmation process for the newest Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was an \u201cadrenaline shot\u201d for Republicans in the midterms.\n\n\u201cI think the Republicans, core voters in the states that were critical to us, were highly offended by the tactics and it was like an adrenaline shot,\u201d McConnell said Wednesday. \u201cWe were worried about a lack of intensity on our side and I think the Kavanaugh fight certainly provided that and was helpful.\u201d\n\nNumerous accusers came forward during Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process accusing him of sexual assault and misconduct leading to a brutal hearing where the first accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified she was \u201c100 percent\u201d certain Kavanaugh assaulted her at a high school party more than 35 years ago.\n\nKavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations, the FBI supplemental background investigation could not find supporting and corroborating evidence to back the claims, and Republicans accused Democrats of treating the nominee unfairly.\n\nDemocrats in deep red states, like Heitkamp in North Dakota, voted against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the high court, potentially contributing to her re-election defeat. Heitkamp, throughout her campaign though, said she had \u201cno regrets\u201d on her decision for the nominee.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that the one who survived voted for Kavanaugh,\u201d McConnell said of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia who easily won re-election on Tuesday.\n\nBut McConnell underscored that his priority for this legislative cycle, and the next, has and will be the judiciary.\n\n\u201cMy top priority, I made it very clear, it is the judiciary, the two Supreme Court appointments. 39 circuit judges. 84 judges and we aren\u2019t through doing those this year,\u201d McConnell said, noting the president has \u201cdone an excellent job\u201d in appointing nominees. \u201cWe intend to keep confirming as many as we possibly can for as long as we\u2019re in a position to do it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt will still be my priority in setting the agenda here in the Senate, and the next Congress as well.\u201d\n\nMcConnell also said he would push for more women to join the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a frustration,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be trying to convince one of our women to go on the Judiciary Committee. Something I\u2019ve tried, and failed, in the last couple of Congresses.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll have two new women Republican senators here shortly,\u201d referring to the contested Arizona race and McSally, and Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn who will be the Republican senator from Tennessee come January.\n\nFox News\u2019 Judson Berger and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.", "President Trump clashed dramatically at Wednesday's press conference with CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta, after the CNN star peppered Trump with questions and refused to give up the microphone as he asked about the migrant caravan and Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cThat's enough. Put down the mic,\u201d he ordered Acosta, as a White House aide tried to take the microphone from him, only for Acosta to initially refuse to turn it over and push her arm down. \u201cI tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person, you shouldn\u2019t be working for CNN.\u201d\n\nCNN fired back on Twitter, calling his attacks on the media \"un-American.\"\n\nIt was one of several testy exchanges during the nearly 90-minute press conference. The dispute began when Acosta first asked Trump about the migrant caravan approaching the U.S. southern border. After challenging Trump whether the caravan really was an \u201cinvasion,\u201d as Trump had previously stated, Acosta proceeded to \u201ccaravan-splain\u201d to Trump.\n\n\u201cThe caravan was not an invasion, it is a group of migrants moving up the border from Central America towards the border with the U.S.,\u201d the reporter scolded Trump.\n\n\u201cThank you for telling me that, I appreciate it,\u201d Trump said, before saying he had not \u201cdemonized\u201d immigrants as Acosta claimed.\n\nBut as Trump answered, Acosta repeatedly interjected and went back and forth with Trump over how the White House had characterized the caravan.\n\n\u201cThey're hundreds of miles away, that\u2019s not an invasion,\u201d Acosta said.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAcosta later asked about the Russian investigation, which Trump then called a \u201choax.\u201d After Acosta eventually sat down, Trump said \u201cthe way you treat [White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders] is horrible and the way you treat other people is horrible,\u201d\n\nAcosta was helped by fellow reporter and NBC correspondent Peter Alexander, who called Acosta a \u201cdiligent reporter who busts his butt.\u201d\n\nTrump shot back: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not a big fan of yours either, to be honest.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Acosta stood up and kept speaking to the president, to which Trump had another retort.\n\n\u201cWhen you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republican National Committee pointed to the exchange that the media was going \"overboard\" with its \"grandstanding.\"\n\n\"We all value a free press, but it\u2019s unfortunate that some reporters seem more interested in getting their own cable show than doing their jobs,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said.\n\nFox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report.", "Josie Canseco is getting ready to spread her wings.\n\nThe 23-year-old daughter of former MLB star Jose Canseco confirmed she will be walking in this year\u2019s Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show.\n\n\u201cExactly 1 week until the #vsfashionshow,\u201d the model recently wrote on Instagram. \u201cI can't believe I just went through fittings today.

The U.S. is determined not to pull back the crippling sanctions it wields against the Hermit Kingdom until Kim Jong Un rids his country of nuclear weapons.

Bob Menendez, all came out victorious on Tuesday, despite being accused of misconduct.\n\nTheir election raises questions whether the Democratic Party, which went all-out to stop now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of assault claims and stressed the importance of believing women\u2019s allegations, is selectively tapping into the #MeToo movement.\n\nEllison, the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), was one of the highest-profile candidates who won the election. He became the state attorney general in Minnesota despite allegations of domestic violence.\n\nKaren Monahan, the Democrat\u2019s former girlfriend, alleged that he once dragged her off a bed while shouting profanities and sent multiple abusive text messages. She also published a 2017 medical document that identified Ellison as the abuser who caused \u201cemotional and physical abuse.\u201d\n\nFULL MIDTERM RESULTS\n\nEllison denied the allegations and an investigation commission by the state Democratic Party cleared him of misconduct allegations.

Senate Majority PAC, a group affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, invested $6 million in the race.\n\nIn some other cases, Democrats also glossed over sexual harassment allegations against lawmakers that are running in solidly Democrat districts where Republicans don\u2019t even put forward candidates.\n\nVirginia Democrat Bobby Scott won Virginia's 3rd Congressional District thanks to nobody challenging him, even after he was accused of sexual misconduct in 2017.\n\nA former Congressional Black Caucus Foundation fellow.

His campaign has been mired with a sexual harassment allegation dating back 20 years, a charge he denied claiming the story was planted just as he announced his bid for Congress.\n\n\u201cBoth the Upper Macungie Township police and the Lehigh County District Attorney's office investigated this accusation and found it to be groundless,\u201d Nothstein said during a press conference in August.\n\nBut some Republicans accused of misconduct were able to get into office on a state level.\n\nKentucky state Republican Rep.

It\u2019s ironic, some say, that a group diametrically opposed to the president's immigration policies is indirectly helping make his case.\n\nTrump wants the caravan to turn around, promising to unleash military assets and potentially amend asylum laws to stop their entry. Yet, Joseph\u2019s advice is the first concrete, straight-forward and honest assessment of the situation many received in weeks.\n\nAfter hearing some of the migrants\u2019 individual stories, Joseph suggested some might reconsider their dreams of living in the U.S.\n\n\u201cA lot depends on how the administration decides to address the situation and the role of the military,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re telling people there is already a wait of over 1,000 people in Tijuana.\u201d\n\nShe said legal advisers are not trying to deter people, \u201cbut trying to give them options and information.\u201d\n\nAfter talking to Joseph, Honduran migrant Jovan Ochoa said he would stay in Mexico.\n\n\u201cIf I get a work permit, I will stay in Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay attention to the asylum part.

Unlike the Obama administration, which tweaked the rules to allow for claims of domestic and gang violence, the Trump administration returned to the original statutory language, which only allows non-citizens to remain in the U.S. if they can establish a credible fear of persecution at home based on race, religion, political thought, nationality or social class.\n\nThat is a small minority among the roughly thousands of migrants who fill Jesus Martinez Stadium, sleeping in tents, bleachers or under tarps.

She said she has \"particular experience in how to win majorities ... and how to defend them.\"\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer said that, over recent years, Germans' feeling of security and trust in a strong state have diminished.\n\nBut she warned against reheating arguments over the rights and wrongs of Merkel's decision in 2015 to allow in large numbers of migrants. Rival Spahn has emphasized concerns about migration.\n\nPeople \"don't expect of us that we spend another three years arguing retrospectively about what was right, less right and wrong in 2015,\" she said. \"You don't win people's confidence in security with harsh tones, with shrill demands.\"\n\nMany observers question whether Merkel can realistically stay much longer as chancellor after a new CDU leader is elected. The next election isn't due until 2021 but Merkel's coalition with the center-left Social Democrats is in poor shape.\n\n\"She is the elected chancellor ... and as long as she has a majority in parliament, she will certainly remain,\" Kramp-Karrenbauer said.", "A Japanese medical university that acknowledged systematically discriminating against female applicants announced Wednesday plans to accept more than 60 who were unfairly rejected over the past two years.\n\nThe discriminatory policy at Tokyo Medical University surfaced earlier this year, triggering national outrage. The school acknowledged in August that it has been reducing female applicants' entrance exam scores for years to keep the numbers of female students low. They said women tend to quit as doctors after starting families, causing staffing shortages at a school-affiliated hospital.\n\nThe university said it will offer to enroll 67 female applicants who were eliminated due to the exam manipulation.\n\nUniversity President Yukiko Hayashi apologized for the school's discriminatory policy.\n\n\"We will conduct fair entrance exams and never let the inappropriate practice be repeated,\" she said. \"Nobody should be discriminated against because of gender.\"\n\nIn Japan, women are still considered responsible for homemaking, childrearing and elderly care, while men are expected to work long hours and outside care services are limited.\n\nThe scandal prompted speculation that other medical schools may also follow similar practices.\n\nHayashi, who became university president in September following her predecessor's resignation over a bribery allegation that led to exposure of the exam manipulation, said she was shocked by the large number of women who were denied entry.\n\nIt isn't clear how many women will accept the school's offer and enroll. Hayashi declined to comment on what the school will do about dozens of male students who were wrongfully given additional points and accepted instead of the women.\n\nThe manipulation came to light during an investigation into allegations that the school accepted the son of an education ministry official in exchange for favorable treatment for the school in obtaining research funds. The bureaucrat and the former head of the school have been charged with bribery.\n\nThe investigation found that the school reduced all applicants' first-stage test scores by 20 percent this year and then added at least 20 points for male applicants, unless they had failed at least four times previously.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nAdolf Hitler went in wartime for revenge. Angela Merkel plans a pilgrimage in the name of peace. Two German chancellors, with opposite aims and the same destination: a train car in a French forest.\n\nHitler literally tried to rewrite history in 1940 when the Nazi leader commanded the dining coach to serve France the humiliation Germany suffered in that same spot on the last day of World War I.\n\nThis time, Merkel will have the French president by her side as she visits what remains of the Wagon of Compiegne, the carriage-turned-office where the Allies and Germany signed the armistice on Nov. 11, 1918.\n\nAn unusual journey took Wagons-Lits Co. carriage 2419D from serving sauteed veal and boeuf bourguignon to passengers in the seaside town of Deauville to serving as a crucible for world peace while stopped in the middle of a forest in Compiegne.\n\nPuzzled tourists often ask Bernard Letemps, the curator of the Armistice Museum, why the Allies signed the cease-fire agreement that ended the atrocities of the Western Front in that humble setting instead of a grand military building or a glittering palace.\n\nAt the time, the official headquarters in Senlis of the Allied commander, French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, would have been the expected place to sign a cease-fire.\n\nBut the town had endured a brutal German assault. Its inhabitants were taken hostage and its mayor shot in September 1914, before the first Battle of the Marne. How the bruised townspeople would react to the presence of a German delegation, even one coming with the goal of peace, was a serious concern.\n\n\"It was out of the question to receive the plenipotentiary Germans in (such a) town,\" Letemps said.\n\nA moveable train carriage in the nearby Compiegne forest was deemed ideal: The isolated location would deter intruders and the calm and secrecy offered a measure of respect to the defeated Germans.\n\nAs it happened, Foch had fitted out a mobile office just the month before \u2014 a dining car chosen at random from the French passenger train fleet. And so 2419D became known as the \"Wagon of Compiegne.\"\n\nThe Armistice was signed just after 5 a.m., but officials held out six hours to put it into effect out of a sense of poetry \u2014 the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918. That delay, rather unpoetically, cost lives on both sides at the end of a war that had already left 17 million dead.\n\n\"The train car represents the end of fighting. The end, when people found peace,\" Letemps said.\n\nHe added, smiling: \"It fulfilled its role of dining car before becoming famous.\"\n\nThe Armistice Museum lays on the train tracks on the site of the signing in the middle of forest.\n\nFoch was immortalized in statues ubiquitous across France and gave his name to one of the broad, leafy avenues radiating out from the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nThe same reception was not reserved for the losing side: One of the Germans to sign the document, Matthias Erzberger, was vilified for his role in the surrender. He was assassinated in 1921.\n\nThe story of dining car 2419D and Compiegne didn't end with the war.\n\nFor throngs of French mourners in the post-war years, the dining car became a shrine to peace and catharsis.\n\nThe car was taken to Paris for display in the courtyard of the Invalides, the final resting place of Napoleon, before it went back to Compiegne in 1927 to sit in a specially-made memorial constructed on the site of today's museum.\n\nLetemps said the wagon received over 190,000 visitors in one year alone in the 1930s as it became a focus for mourning France's 1.4 million fallen soldiers.\n\nFor Hitler in those same years, it became a rallying cry during his ascent to power as he exploited the German public's contempt for the punitive terms of surrender.\n\nThe Nazi leader visited the site in 1940 when his armies conquered France.\n\nThe Fuhrer ordered the dining car brought out of the memorial and returned to the tracks in the spot in the forest it occupied in 1918.\n\nWhat ensued was Hitler's surreal theatrical restaging of the 1918 armistice, one of history's most famous events, with literally the tables' turned.\n\nThe 1940 Armistice was dictated in that train \u2014 with Germany the victor and France the loser.\n\n\"General (Wilhelm) Keitel read the conditions for the Armistice in the car, with Chancellor Hitler sitting in the place of Marshal Foch,\" Letemps said.\n\nHitler then ordered the car to be hauled to Germany and displayed, like a notorious prisoner of war, at the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nThe dining car was destroyed at the end of World War II, though how that happened has been lost to time. Some accounts blame members of the Nazi SS, others a random airstrike.\n\nIn 1950, French manufacturer Wagons-Lits, the company that ran the Orient Express, donated a car from the same series to the museum \u2014 2439D is identical to its ravaged twin from its polished wooden finishes to its studded, leather-bound chairs. It is parked beside the display of the original car remains: a few fragments of bronze decoration and two access ramps.\n\nOn Saturday, Merkel becomes the first German chancellor in 78 years to visit the forest clearing where the end of the globe's first conflict was written.\n\nShe will be joined by French President Emmanuel Macron in a scene reminiscent of 1984 when Chancellor Helmut Kohl poignantly held President Francois Mitterrand's hand at an ossuary near Verdun.\n\nOn the centenary of the conflict's end, this visit will make for soul-searing images of its own.\n\n___\n\nThomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamson_K", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nThe first hour of the Brian Kilmeade Radio Show on FOX News Talk 9am-Noon Eastern M-F.", "He wants to put a ring on it, but she may be expecting a diamond as big as the Ritz.\n\nA soon-to-be fianc\u00e9e was slammed online after she discovered her engagement ring in her boyfriend\u2019s belongings and complained about it on Facebook \u2014 before the proposal even happened.\n\nAfter the unidentified woman found the ring in his nightstand, she uploaded a photo in a \u201cring shaming\u201d Facebook group, a community dedicated to criticizing engagement baubles, Yahoo reported.\n\n\u201cEwwwww.

One of the people he wounded was a 72-year-old man who was left paralyzed and died seven months after the shooting.\n\nThe appellate court ruled last year that there was not enough evidence to convict Vivat in the shootings, which were carried out by a man wearing a balaclava to conceal his identity. In his original trial, Vivat received a 37-year, 4-month sentence, partly on the basis of a confession to police, but also because the shooting was carried out in front of hundreds of people and was captured in many photos and videos that served as evidence. However, he recanted his confession in court, claiming he had been tortured.\n\nThe shooter was believed to have fired his weapon from inside the sack in order to catch the used bullet casings so they could not be gathered as evidence.\n\nVivat has already spent around four years in detention, having been denied bail and kept in prison while his earlier acquittal was under appeal.\n\nHe displayed no emotion as Wednesday's verdict was delivered and had a brief exchange with relatives and his lawyer before officials sent him back to Bang Kwang prison.\n\nHis lawyer, Puangthip Boonsanong, said she respected the court's decision even though she had expected Vivat's acquittal to stand.

In the two-page letter, the author describes the struggle to catch the fish, which was landed by his friend, the painter Henry Strater. Hemingway also recounts the shark attack that occurred while the Marlin was being hauled onto his boat \u201cPilar.\u201d\n\nSTUNNING SHIPWRECK DISCOVERY: 'WORLD'S OLDEST INTACT' WRECK FOUND\n\nDated May 8, 1935, the letter was sent to Erl Roman, the Miami Herald\u2019s fishing editor. In the letter, Hemingway explains that the fish would have weighed between 700 and 900 pounds, but notes that some of the marlin\u2019s meat had been torn off by sharks. \u201cHe weighed 500 [pounds] before 20 some witnesses,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe letter, written in pencil, differs from other accounts of the incident, according to auction house Nate D. Sanders Auctions. \u201cImportantly, Hemingway's account of the marlin catch differs from other anecdotal stories of it, one of which describes Hemingway using a \u2018machine gun\u2019' on the shark, which purportedly attracted more sharks to the feeding frenzy,\u201d it said, in a statement. \u201cIt's likely Hemingway left out this detail, as Strater would blame its use on attracting more sharks to the marlin, depriving Strater of a world record marlin catch.\u201d\n\nThe letter and its envelope, which are accompanied by a black-and-white photo of the catch, will be auctioned by Nate D.

Democrats made several efforts to obtain Trump's returns while in the minority, only to be rejected by House Republicans.\n\nTrump would likely seek to stall those requests with legal challenges, and it remains unclear whether Democrats could publicly release his tax returns even if they obtained them for investigative purposes.\n\nBefore a rally in Indiana on Monday, Trump brushed off the threat. \"I don't care,\" he said. \"They can do whatever they want, and I can do whatever I want.\"\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler, the Democrat who was projected to win New York's 10th congressional district, warned Trump in a tweet his administration would be \"held accountable.\"\n\n\"Tonight, the American people have demanded accountability from their government and sent a clear message of what they want from Congress,\" he wrote. Trump \"may not like it, but he and his administration will be held accountable to our laws and to the American people.\"\n\nHouse committees can effectively hold in statutory contempt anyone who refuses to fully comply with a subpoena relevant to the committee's legislative purpose and pertinent to its investigation. While criminal penalties, including fines and even imprisonment, are then possible with a judge's approval, separation-of-powers issues emerge when the House tries to penalize a member of the Executive branch.\n\nIn 2014, a federal judge denied House Republicans' efforts to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of court, saying the move was \"entirely unnecessary.\"\n\nFROM MAXINE WATERS TO JERRY NADLER, MEET THE LIKELY NEW HEADS OF KEY HOUSE COMMITTEES\n\nBut even fruitless investigations can beleaguer and derail administrations, and historical evidence suggests they are becoming a popular partisan tool in the lower chamber for that reason.\n\nResearch conducted by Cornell University political science professor Douglas Kriner, who co-wrote the 2016 book \"Investigating the President: Congressional Checks on Presidential Power,\" underscores how important control of the House, as opposed to the generally less partisan and slower-moving Senate, is to these congressional probes.\n\n\"We examined every congressional investigation from 1898 to 2014 \u2013 more than 11,900 days of investigative hearings,\" Kriner told Fox News. \"What we found is that divided government is a major driver of investigations in the House. This is particularly true in periods of intense partisan polarization. For example, from 1981-2014, the House averaged holding 67 days of investigative hearings per year in divided government, versus only 18 per year in unified government.\"\n\nKAVANAUGH EFFECT? RED-STATE DEMS WHO OPPOSED KAVANAUGH ALL OUSTED IN MIDTERMS\n\nKriner added that modern congressional probes seem geared towards \"maximiz[ing] the political damage on the White House,\" rather than producing more substantive results. \"Investigations are less likely to trigger new legislation than in previous, less polarized eras,\" Kriner told Fox News.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly derided the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into possible illegal Russian collusion and obstruction of justice as a \"partisan witch hunt,\" saying it's fueled by Democrats upset that he won the 2016 election. But it's not clear how effective those attacks have been: An August poll showed that 59 percent of registered voters approve of Mueller's investigation.\n\nSECRET WATERGATE 'ROAD MAP' COULD OFFER GUIDANCE FOR MUELLER PROBE\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat, Adam Schiff, already has warned his party would relaunch the Russia probe in the House with Democrats in charge.\n\n\u201cWe will be able to get answers the Republicans were unwilling to pursue,\u201d he recently told CNN.\n\nDemocrats have an array of potential avenues of investigation to pursue aside from Russia. In September, a federal judge ruled that Democrats have standing to sue Trump over potential violations of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which ostensibly precludes the president from accepting certain foreign favors. While the legal argument that Trump is violating this clause by maintaining lucrative and profitable overseas investments is far from settled, Democrats' pursuit of this line of argument offers some clues into what their investigations might focus on.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina Law Professor Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional expert who testified during impeachment proceedings of former President Bill Clinton, told Fox News in an interview that Democrats might focus on Trump's financial ties to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"It is possible \u2014 would not be a surprise \u2014 if there were some interest in exploring the president\u2019s Saudi connections or finances,\" Gerhardt said, before adding: \"It would also not surprise me if the Democrats did not pursue these things.\"\n\nTRUMP: SAUDI ARABIA DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO USE US-MADE BOMBS IN YEMEN\n\nThe killing of dissident Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey last month led to heightened scrutiny of the past connections between Trump's business empire and the Islamic country. The president initially condemned what he characterized as a rush to judgment against the Saudi government, before saying that its agents had apparently engaged in the \"worst cover-up ever.\"\n\nTrump has tweeted that he has \"no financial interests in Saudi Arabia,\" and there is no evidence that he currently does. However, he has repeatedly touted his real estate deals with the country, saying at a 2015 rally that \"they buy apartments from me\" and \"spend $40 million, $50 million.

In a campaign email in the days leading up to Tuesday's vote, the president made an impassioned effort to cut down on Cipollone's workload, saying Democrats are interested only in \"vicious obstruction and mindless resistance.\"\n\n\"We can only imagine what they\u2019d do with legitimate power in our government,\" Trump said. \"We can\u2019t hand Democrats the keys to Congress.

In contrast, the lone Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, won his race.\n\n\"Every Dem Senator in a competitive race who voted against Kavanaugh lost,\" tweeted Tom Bevan, Co-founder of RealClearPolitics. Fox News polling offered evidence the Kavanaugh issue was a major problem for those battleground incumbent Democrats.\n\nA Fox News poll from early October, just before the Kavanaugh confirmation vote, found 34 percent of North Dakotans said they would be less likely to vote for Heitkamp if she voted against Kavanaugh, with just 17 percent saying it would make them more likely to vote for her.\n\nIn Missouri, among the 28 percent of voters who said they could still switch candidates, almost twice as many said they'd be less likely to support McCaskill if she opposed Kavanaugh.\n\nIn Indiana, a Fox News poll found 32 percent said they would be less likely to vote for Braun if he voted against Kavanaugh, compared to 30 percent who would be more likely.\n\nSen.

Despite spending over one billion dollars, more money than ever before for a midterm election, and even though they were confident of crushing a historically unpopular president, Democrats appear to have mustered only a slim majority in the House, while not even coming close to taking over the Senate. Their win in the House seems at best to have been in line with historical averages; they had expected more.\n\nAdmittedly, Democrats had a tough map to defend, including 10 Senate seats in states won decisively by President Trump in 2016. Nonetheless, from Texas to Indiana to Florida to Missouri to Tennessee, they spent big in hopes the Resistance would blast through the Red Wall of the Senate, only to find that President Trump\u2019s supporters stood by their man.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans had their challenges, too. They needed to win almost all of the 25 seats they held in districts that had gone for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Democrats only needed to flip 23 seats to take control of the House; that they did.\n\nAs the early results filtered in, seeming to favor Democrats, commentators argued that President Trump should have stuck to speaking about the economy, that he made a mistake in backing Ron DeSantis in the Florida primary for governor (DeSantis won), that his belligerent approach to the migrant caravan was sure to cost Republicans important seats. To hear them tell it, he did everything wrong.\n\nThey suggested that the president had erred in making the race all about him. He, in effect, had put himself on the ballot. But President Trump didn\u2019t do that; Democrats did. From the moment he was elected in 2016, the left made him the focus of their campaigns. Democrats didn\u2019t have an economic platform, they had anti-Trump fever, and they thought that was enough.\n\nCertainly, some of their backers thought it was enough. Party activist and billionaire Tom Steyer coughed up millions of dollars to give those Democratic candidates who promised to help impeach President Trump. That was his sole ambition.\n\nAnd yet, once again his critics underestimated President Trump. Yes, Republicans lost the House. But keeping the Senate was far more important to the ongoing rebalancing of our nation\u2019s courts and to keep a check on Democrats in the House. It also is a bulwark against impeachment.\n\nAt the end of the day, it can be safely concluded that without the president\u2019s indefatigable efforts on the campaign trail, without those huge rallies in 11 states in the last 8 days, the GOP might well not have held the Senate. He stirred up the base, warning that the thousands marching north from Central America would storm our border, and pushed them to vote. Would they have shown up at the voting booth just to celebrate declining unemployment and rising pay? Doubtful.\n\nExit polls revealed that health care was the number one issue for 41 percent of voters. Thanks to former Senator John McCain, the Republicans had fumbled the ball on health care, and Democrats were smart to pounce on the vulnerability.\n\nThe number two issue was immigration, topping the economy by 23 percent to 21 percent. Was immigration a top concern because Trump made it so? Perhaps, but it was a stronger closing argument than job creation. People are more likely to vote out of anger than gratitude.\n\nThe key Senate races had shifted back in forth several times. After the revolting Kavanaugh spectacle, polls had moved in favor of Republicans, but then came the pipe bombs directed at Democrats across the country, and the horrific mass shooting of Jews at the Tree of Life Synagogue. Those incidents stalled the GOP surge as commentators and Democrats blamed President Trump for raising the temperature of our political discourse. The polls widened again, in favor of Democrats.\n\nThen Trump hit the campaign trail, reminding his voters of the economic progress we have made in these past two years, of the conservative judges placed on the Supreme Court and lesser courts across the country, of the rollback of stifling regulations, of progress in negotiating with North Korea, his hardened stance against Iran and against China\u2019s ongoing theft of America\u2019s intellectual property.\n\nThough critics scoff, the Trump White House has accomplished much, and his voters have cheered every step of the way.\n\nIn the closing days of the campaign, the polls again moved narrowly in favor of several GOP Senate candidates, especially those who had rallied with Trump.\n\nIn the final days, much was made about the energy in both parties. Enthusiasm for voting hit record levels for a midterm contest; pundits assumed that would drive turnout for voters on both sides who might otherwise have stayed home. But, they also concluded that it would especially boost Democrats since portions of their coalitions (like young people and minorities) cannot be counted on to show up.\n\nWe do not have all the data yet, but judging from the long lines of people waiting to vote on Tuesday turnout was indeed high. In the end, though, that may have favored Republicans in key races since often the party in the White House suffers from complacency. And it is likely that all those rallies helped.\n\nIn 2010, the Tea Party, outraged that ObamaCare had passed with not one Republican vote, also targeted an incumbent president. In that contest, President Obama\u2019s party lost six seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House, the worst outcome in modern times.\n\nBy contrast, it looks like President Trump had a pretty good night.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThousands of Central American migrants will take at least a couple of days to rest in a Mexico City stadium as they debate whether to accept offers to stay in Mexico or continue their trek to the U.S. border.\n\nHumanitarian aid stepped up Tuesday for the roughly 4,500 Central American migrants gathered at the Jesus Martinez stadium after an arduous journey that has taken them through three countries in three weeks. Mexico City officials said they are bracing as many as 5,500 migrants at the sports complex as more trickle in.\n\nMembers of the caravans of migrants, which President Donald Trump made a central issue in U.S. midterm elections, declined to take an immediate decision Tuesday night on whether to definitively stay in Mexico or continue north, opting to remain in the capital at least a couple more days.\n\n\"Nobody is in more of a hurry than me to get going (to the U.S. border), but we have to go all together,\" said Sara Rodriguez of Colon, Honduras. Rodriguez, 34, fled her country with her 16-year-old daughter Emily, after the girl began to draw unwanted attention from a drug trafficker.\n\nMexico is offering refugee, asylum or work visas to the migrants. The government said 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them while they waited for the 45-day application process for a more permanent status.\n\nRina Valenzuela, who is from El Salvdor, listened attentively to aid workers from the nonprofit Institute for Women in Migration as they explained the difficulties of applying for and securing asylum in the U.S. Valenzuela decided she would better off applying for refuge in Mexico.\n\n\"Why go fight there, with as much effort and as much suffering as we have gone through, just for them to turn me back? Well, no,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of city employees and even more volunteers were on hand Tuesday to sort donations and direct migrants toward food, water, diapers and other basics. Migrants searched through piles of donated clothes, grabbed boxes of milk for children and lined up to make quick calls home at a stand set up by the Red Cross.\n\nEmployees from the capital's human rights commission registered new arrivals with biographical data\u2014 such as age and country of origin\u2014 and placed yellow bracelets on wrists to keep count.\n\nThe atmosphere at the stadium in Mexico City was more institutional and organized than what migrants encountered on the road, where townspeople pushed bags of drinking water, tacos and fruit into their hands as they passed through tiny hamlets in southern Mexico.\n\nBut there were signs that the stadium was already nearing its capacity to hold 6,000 people.\n\nMaria Yesenia Perez, 41, said there was no space in the stadium when she and her 8-year-old daughter arrived during the night, so the two from Honduras slept on the grass outside. Migrants pitched tents in the parking lot and constructed makeshift shelters from plywood covered with blankets and tarps. Forty portable toilets were scattered across the grass.\n\nThe stadium's enclosed space and government intervention makes it difficult for aid workers to reach the migrants, said Nancy Rojas, an Oxfam charity worker who has accompanied the migrants for weeks.\n\nFour big tents have been set up for women and children to sleep under with thin mattresses and blankets, while men were relegated Monday night to concrete bleachers. Temperatures dropped below 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11 Celsius) during the night in a city some 7,300 feet (2,240 meters) above sea level and still hundreds of miles from the U.S. border.\n\nSeveral smaller groups were trailing hundreds of miles to the south. Mexico City Mayor Ramon Amieva said the city needs to \"reinforce\" to meet the needs of the migrants, especially vulnerable children and pregnant women.\n\nMexico City's central market supplied 3.5 tons of bananas and guavas to refuel the crowd, plus 600 bottles of water. The human rights commission said it planned to set up more tents and eating areas.\n\nMany of the migrants sought treatment for blistered and aching feet, respiratory infections, diarrhea and other maladies.\n\nTrump has seized on the caravan as an election issue and portrayed it as a major threat, though such caravans have sprung up regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed.\n\nHe ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, vowed to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nIn dozens of interviews since the initial caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are escaping poverty and rampant violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence. Others say they hope to find work and send money to support relatives back home.\n\nOrganizers are urging members of the caravan already in Mexico City to await the arrival of stragglers and perhaps even the other caravans further back. The idea is to find strength in numbers. The outpouring of support for the caravan that first set out from Honduras on Oct. 13 has inspired thousands of others to march north from Central America.\n\nFormer Honduran lawmaker Bartolo Fuentes, blamed by some for starting the caravan, re-joined the group in Mexico after being detained in Guatemala and deported to Honduras.\n\nFuentes denied leading the movement, saying it was a natural response \"to a situation more terrible than war.\" He said about 300 to 400 Hondurans leave their country on an average day.\n\n\"What do we have here then?

He conceded to DeSantis, who has been an outspoken supporter of President Trump, saying he still \"believes in the long run, good always wins over evil.\"\n\nFULL MIDTERM RESULTS\n\n\"I still believe that,\" Gillum said in his concession speech.\n\n\"We could not be prouder of the way that we ran this race. We couldn't be prouder. We could not be more thankful for the support that was shown by each and every one of you. All the way along this path,\" Gillum said. \"We let our voices be heard. We didn't shrink from the challenges. We didn't shrink from power. We spoke truth to power. And just because we didn't always come out victorious we didn't retreat. We stood up we stood strong we spoke out because we recognize that we had power.\"\n\nGillum said he called Desantis and congratulated him, but told supporters that \"in spite of our congratulating him on his victory this evening nothing that we believe in is compromised.\"\n\nDeSantis\u2019 victory keeps the crucial swing state of Florida in Republican hands for the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHis victory comes after a heated campaign to succeed Republican Gov. Rick Scott, who is term-limited. Scott is running against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched Senate races. Fox News' Decision Desk still has projected that race as too close to call.\n\nDeSantis, who attended Yale University and Harvard Law School, resigned his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in September to focus solely on his gubernatorial bid. He enjoyed support from President Trump throughout his campaign. The president endorsed DeSantis in June.\n\nDeSantis argued throughout the campaign that Florida\u2019s relationship with the president \u2013 whether he or she agrees with his policies or not\u2014 is important for the state.\n\n\u201cYou need to be able to work with the president,\u201d DeSantis said last month, saying he would be \u201cbetter positioned to advance Florida\u2019s priorities\u201d due to his \u201cproductive relationship with the administration.\u201d\n\nThe DeSantis-Gillum campaign was among the most closely watched in the country this midterm election season. Though Gillum had a slight edge in the polls leading up to Election Day, and support from high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Florida has not elected a Democratic governor since 1994.\n\nMIDTERM LIVE BLOG\n\nRacial divisions were highlighted throughout the campaign. The day after Gillum won the Democratic primary, DeSantis said Florida voters shouldn\u2019t \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum. The former GOP congressman spent weeks explaining the remark, maintaining it had nothing to do with race, but rather his belief that Gillum would hurt Florida\u2019s economy.\n\nIn turn, Gillum was assailed over alleged ties to a radical far-left group associated with anti-Semitism and Palestinian terrorism. Additionally, his campaign cut ties with a volunteer during the final weeks of the race, after the volunteer was caught on video calling Florida a \u201ccracker\u201d state and saying the campaign was taking advantage of \u201cwhite guilt.\u201d\n\nGillum\u2019s campaign also battled headaches over an FBI probe into possible corruption in Tallahassee during his administration. Gillum has long denied wrongdoing, and said the FBI even told him he was not a focus of the investigation. But Republicans, including Trump, made an effort to tie Gillum and his record to the federal investigation.\n\n\u201cIn Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country!\u201d Trump tweeted last week.\n\nGillum responded that Trump was \u201chowling because he\u2019s weak,\u201d and tweeted that Trump was lying about him. \u201cBut as my grandmother told me -- never wrestle with a pig. You both get dirty, but the pig likes it. So ignore him and vote, Florida!\u201d\n\nThe dispute further elevated Gillum\u2019s national profile, while also drawing attention back to the FBI investigation. According to local reports, the FBI has been investigating potential corruption related to land deals. Last year, the FBI issued subpoenas for documents from the city related to developers.\n\nSeparate from the FBI investigation, Gillum was criticized for a 2016 interaction with an undercover FBI agent. The agent was posing as a businessman interested in investing in Tallahassee, according to local reports.\n\nGillum\u2019s past actions were scrutinized by the Florida Commission on Ethics. That ethics probe recently revealed that he\u2019d accepted tickets to the Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d from the undercover FBI agent in 2016.\n\nGillum claimed he thought the ticket came from his younger brother, and acknowledged that he \u201cshould have asked more questions.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Kaitlyn Schallhorn, Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "After Sen.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, despite leading the polls in her House contest, seemed to make a series of gaffes throughout her campaign -- stumbling when asked whether she considered House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the leader of the House Democrats; claiming that unemployment was low \u201cbecause everyone has two jobs,\u201d and stumbling over her strategy over how to fund Medicare for all.\n\nIn an interview this week, when asked about that funding, she suggested people would \u201cjust pay for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople often say, like, how are you going to pay for it and I find the question so puzzling because \u2018How do you pay for something that\u2019s more affordable? How do you pay for cheaper rent?\u2019 You just pay for it,\u201d she said in an interview with Jorge Ramos. \u201cWe\u2019re paying more now.\u201d\n\nAccording to some recent studies, the program, first introduced by Sanders over the summer, would increase government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThe spending hikes would allow the government to replace what employers and consumers currently pay for health care \u2014 delivering significant savings on administrative and drug costs, but increasing demand for care that would drive up spending, according to a study released by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University over the summer. The study estimated that doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes would not fully cover the additional costs for the program.\n\nBut under the plan, all Americans would gain access to government insurance with no co-pays or deductibles.\n\nThe insurance industry would be relegated to a minor role in the system. Supporters argue that other developed countries already have implemented systems like this, and America\u2019s private insurance-centered model continues to leave some families with crushing costs.\n\n\u201cIn a modern, moral and wealthy society, no person should be too poor to live,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told Ramos. \u201cWe should treat healthcare, housing, and education as rights.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI believe we should guarantee a basic level of human dignity in America.\u201d\n\nPrior to learning of her victory, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, thanking her supporters.\n\n\u201cI am so thankful for every single person who contributed, amplified, and worked to establish this movement,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cNever forget the hard work it took to get us here.

Rod Blum Tuesday night and is among youngest women ever elected to the U.S. House.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer has defeated Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Fox News projects.\n\nThe GOP was able to flip the seat after Heitkamp voted against confirming Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and came under fire for releasing an ad revealing the names of sexual assault victims without their permission.\n\nCramer won the race by hitting her on both those issues, and on a standard Republican platform of supporting tough immigration laws, lower taxes, gun rights, pro-life policies, and deregulation.\n\nPolling indicated a close race for some time, but Heitkamp fell behind amid the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process, when she ultimately voted against him. She also came under fire due to a campaign ad that released names of alleged sexual assault victims without their permission.\n\nPolling indicated the Kavanaugh controversy made a difference in deep red North Dakota, a state that President Trump won by 35 points. A Fox News poll taken days before Kavanaugh's confirmation vote found 34 percent of North Dakotans said they would be less likely to vote for Heitkamp if she voted against Kavanaugh, with just 17 percent saying it would make them more likely to vote for her.\n\nThe Kavanaugh situation was followed by a scandal in which Heitkamp's campaign released an ad listing the names of alleged sexual assault victims, some of whom said they had not given permission to release their names. Others said they had never been assaulted. Heitkamp's campaign apologized, saying the release of names was a \"mistake\".\n\nHeitkamp also came under fire recently for endorsing an ad that claimed that North Dakotans with out-of-state hunting licenses could lose those licenses if they vote. Heitkamp claimed it was true, but Politifact called the Fish and Wildlife offices in North Dakota\u2019s neighboring states, and found it to be false. Politifact rated the claim as \u201cpants on fire\u201d and concluded that \u201cit\u2019s hard to interpret this in any way except that it seeks to discourage people from voting.\u201d\n\nBy Election Day, the result was not a surprise. Both the latest Fox News poll and the RealClearPolitics average of polls showed Cramer leading Heitkamp by nine points going into the election.\n\nHeitkamp was known in the Senate as someone who was sometimes willing to cross the aisle. She voted for a banking deregulation bill, along with 16 other Democrats and 50 Republicans, that aimed to reduce regulations on community banks. While Heitkamp voted against Kavanaugh, she voted to confirm Trump's other Supreme Court pick, Justice Neil Gorsuch, telling CNBC, \"would he be the judge I'd pick? No, never... But he is the judge that the duly elected president picked.\"\n\nBut on big issues like tax cuts and repealing ObamaCare, Heitkamp stood with her party. She voted for bills that included funding President Trump's proposed border wall, but she also went against defunding sanctuary cities.\n\nPresident Trump campaigned for Kevin Cramer in June, holding a rally in Fargo, North Dakota. In October, the President also chimed in on Twitter: \"Watched North Dakota\u2019s Rep. Kevin Cramer easily win debate with Senator Heidi Heitkamp.
