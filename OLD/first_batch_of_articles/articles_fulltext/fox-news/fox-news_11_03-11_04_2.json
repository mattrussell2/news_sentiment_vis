["A woman who was captured on video spouting off racist remarks to two black women who were having car trouble in a North Carolina parking lot reportedly turned herself in to police on Saturday.\n\nSusan Westwood, 51, contacted the Sunset Beach Police Department and was subsequently served by the Brunswick County Sheriff's Department with an outstanding misdemeanor warrant and four criminal summonses, WBTV reported.\n\nLaw enforcement officials had issued a warrant for Westwood \u2014 dubbed \"South Park Susan\" \u2014 and released the two calls she made to 911 on Oct. 19. They said she misused the emergency line system when she reported sisters Leia and Mary Garris to police.\n\nThe Garris sisters were waiting for AAA in an apartment complex parking lot in Charlotte when Westwood confronted them, asking where they lived because she didn't recognize them.\n\nIn the 911 calls released by police and published by the news station, Westwood was heard identifying the women to police as \"African-American\" and saying, \"they've been hanging out here for a while, and they've been photographing me.\"\n\nBLACK BABYSITTER FOR WHITE KIDS FELT 'CRIMINALIZED' AFTER WHITE WOMAN CALLED COPS, HE SAYS\n\nAn emergency dispatcher was heard telling Westwood that first responders received a call about someone's car breaking down at the location Westwood indicated. Westwood, in response, said the situation was \"weird\" and she was \"concerned.\" She added that \"there's no car broken down, there's somebody trying to cause problems.\"\n\n\"No one breaks their car down in the best part of society. I'm sorry to have to do that out loud, but nobody breaks their car down here on purpose unless they're looking for money,\" Westwood told the dispatcher. \"They don't belong here.\"\n\nWestwood adds she'd pay \"$2,500 to get them out of here. ... Just get them the f--- out of here right now.\"\n\nOne of the sisters, in her call to 911, was heard telling police: \u201cThe lady was pushing me in my face, and I\u2019m a resident here just like she is. It surprised me, I\u2019ve been living here for over a year and I\u2019ve never been treated this way.\"\n\nA video filmed during the encounter showed Westwood saying, \"Hi, how are you? I'm hot and I'm beautiful. I'm 51. What are we going to talk about tonight? Being hot? Being beautiful? Being white?\" The woman was also heard asking if she needed to bring her concealed weapons, and mentioning that she made \"$125,000 a year.\"\n\nWestwood's employer, Charter Communications, told WSOC-TV that Westwood was fired, as the incident was \"a blatant violation of Charter's code of conduct and clearly disregards the company's commitment to inclusion and respectful behavior.\"", "Former President Barack Obama spoke Sunday in Gary, Indiana and at a second rally in Chicago, delivering a closing argument for Democrats aiming to put a firm check on President Trump\u2019s policies in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., who faces a stiff challenge from Republican businessman Mike Braun, Obama said the vote on Tuesday is for the character of the nation.\n\n\u201cAmerica is at a crossroads,\u201d Obama said in Gary, which is just across the state line from Chicago. \u201cIn two days, you get to vote in what I believe will be the most important election of our lifetimes. I know politicians always say that, but this time it\u2019s really true.\u201d\n\nHe noted that creating civil rights for Americans, better health care and workers\u2019 wages \u2014 and also preventing them from being rolled back happens with actions at the polls.\n\nHe said Democrats are responsible for progress and Republicans like to be reactionary to that progress for a better nation.\n\n\u201cWhen you vote, you can be a check on bad behavior,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama repeated his attack on the Trump administration, but never mentioning the sitting president\u2019s name, as he\u2019s often done on the campaign trail this season.\n\n\u201cSociety doesn\u2019t work unless words have meaning and consequences,\u201d Obama said, as The Indianapolis Star reported. \u201cAnd the only check right now on the behavior of these Republicans is you and your vote.\u201d\n\nObama ended his speech paralleling his mantra of hope and change: \u201cChange is gonna happen. Hope is gonna happen. With each new step we take, hope will spread. Goodness will spread. And you will be the ones who will have done it. It starts with you. Let\u2019s go vote.

Pritzker, Democrats\u2019 nominee for Illinois governor in his race against Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who came into office an outsider promising responsibly spending, lower taxes and clean government. It\u2019s been a battle of wealthy titans spending their way through potentially the costliest gubernatorial campaign in U.S. history. The tough-talking Rauner finds himself in danger of becoming only the third Illinois governor since 1900 \u2014 after Democrat Edward Dunne in 1916 and Republican Richard Ogilvie in 1972 \u2014 to serve one four-year term but lose re-election. Only two incumbents have lost by more than 10 percentage points since the 19th century \u2014 in 1948 and 1960.\n\nWILL IMMIGRATION MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR GOP AT THE POLLS?\n\nStumping for Pritzker, the 53-year-old billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, Obama questioned the present reality of the American spirit, and asked the rallygoers to mobilize to the polls. \u201cWe are in this together, and we rise and fall as one nation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cGoodness and decency are still out there, kindness is still out there, generosity is still out there, hope is still out there, we just have to stand up and speak for it.\n\nHe said there is a contest of ideas presently about what America is now and what the nation is going to be, and he said to choose hope over fear, and that regular Americans can check the privileged who may use their power and rhetoric to divide with ballots cast for the Democratic Party, who always have to clean up the mess that Republicans make in office. \u201cThey\u2019ve racked up enough indictments to field a football team. No one in my administration got indicted,\u201d he said about the Trump administration.\n\nObama said progress in America is summed up with: \u201cOrdinary people did extraordinary things.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "", "A woman who accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh of rape has admitted she made it all up.\n\nWhen investigators confronted leftwing activist Judy Munro-Leighton, she admitted it was all just a \"ploy.\"\n\nTo stop the nomination.\n\nIt nearly ruined a man and his family.\n\nWhich is easy to do, when one entire party rejects due process.

Through three rounds of competition, contestants will design everything including blades, bows and, yes, guns.\n\nHowever, despite the current controversial climate surrounding firearms in America, hosts Ashley Hlebinsky and Zeke Stout believe that what their show truly offers is a glimpse into history and craftsmanship as modern blacksmiths and forgers come from all over the country to showcase something that\u2019s rapidly getting lost.\n\n\u201cIf anything I would hope to see that the people who aren\u2019t super excited about firearms are going to see the artistry and the craftsmanship that goes into this. It\u2019s something you see these guys putting their heart and soul into the work they\u2019re doing to build a tool to help someone on the farm or help their family or even defend themselves if they have to .. .not necessarily the ones we\u2019re building,\u201d Stout, a certified firearms specialist and executive of one of the largest gunsmithing schools in the country told Fox News in a phone interview. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of artistry that goes into this. So even if somebody is not into firearms atr all, they can appreciate the way we deliver it as an artistic craft as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is that combination of the practical application and the history. A lot of people think history is boring, but watching it come alive might inspire people to learn more about a specific time period, or maybe even learn the craft,\u201d Hlebinsky, one of the leading firearms historians in the U.S. told Fox News,\n\nShe noted that, while seeing the lethality of weapons throughout history is exciting to watch, she notes that the real appeal of \u201cMast of Arms\u201d is the art.\n\nFirearms are one of the least talked about decorative arts. From the 16h through the 18th century, they were highly sought after and gunsmiths were a lot of times considered traditional artists,\u201d Hlebinsky said. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of art of the firearm, the function vs the aesthetic beauty of it. There\u2019s also the military history as well.\u201d\n\nDespite the series hoping to focus on the history and art of modern firearm-building techniques on historical challenges, firearms are an undoubtedly controversial topic in the United States. However, Zeke and Ashley want to make it clear to fans that the show is not hoping to inspire a generation of firearm enthusiasts, but rather a generation of people hoping to innovate with their hands.\n\n\u201cI hope people can come on and watch the show and then see the amount of work that goes into it. With a lot more modern weapons it\u2019s all mechanical, there\u2019s robots doing it,\u201d Stout said. \u201cThese are guys that take their hands and create amazing things that are functional works of art. I also hope a younger audience that sees it starts to think, \u2018hey, I can get out in my garage and do stuff with my hands.\u2019 It might not necessarily be weapons, but there\u2019s a lot you can do. I think innovation has started to stagnate a bit just because there is a lot more automation\u2026.

The congressman fought back against any comparisons to the gunman, kicking out a man from an Iowa event after he said the politician and the gunman \"both share an ideology that is fundamentally anti-immigration,\" as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported.\n\nKing was once seen as easily winning reelection, but that has been thrown into jeopardy in the last week amid condemnation from many Republican leaders and the announcement by a number of companies that they no longer would contribute to his campaign.\n\nCLICK FOR COMPLETE FOX NEWS 2018 MIDTERMS COVERAGE\n\nThe Iowa lawmaker also has been slammed for speaking last summer to a publication linked to Austria's Nazi-founded Freedom Party -- and saying, among other things, that diversity was \"not a strength.\"\n\nDefending his interactions with the group, the congressman said it ousted former Nazis decades ago, aside from one with \u201ca little youthful affiliation.\u201d The party's current leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, reportedly was involved in neo-Nazi groups when he was younger.\n\nTWITTER: WE REMOVED OVER 10,000 BOTS THAT PRETENDED TO BE DEMOCRATS, TRIED TO DISCOURAGE VOTING\n\nOn the opposite side of aisle, Stephen King has been a frequent critic of President Trump and Republicans.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nItaly's president lamented World War I's roots in \"aggressive nationalism\" and held up the European Union on Sunday as the \"highest expression\" of a commitment to common good needed to prevent catastrophic military conflicts.\n\nCommemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of the war, Italian head of state Sergio Mattaella also recalled Europe's history of anti-Semitism as he urged young people to remember the conflict's lessons while striving for peaceful coexistence.\n\n\"To celebrate together the end of the war and to jointly honor the fallen - all the fallen - signifies to reiterate with force, all together, that over the path of war, we prefer to develop friendship and collaboration,\" Mattarella said at a ceremony in Trieste, a port city not far from some of the deadliest battles between Italian soldiers and troops of the Austrian-Hungarian empire.\n\nThe event was part of a week of observances planned for the centenary of Armistice Day. More than 60 heads of state and government, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, are expected to attend an international ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris on the Nov. 11 anniversary.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron started a six-day tour of World War I battlegrounds Sunday night in the eastern French city of Strasbourg. Accompanying him were his wife, Brigitte, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to attend a ceremony in memory of the soldiers who died early in the war, during the Battle of Morang in 1914.\n\nIn Trieste, Italy's president singled out the memory of a \"simple soldier,\" Vittorio Calderoni, who died from his wounds at age 17 just after World War I ended. Calderoni was the son of Italians who had immigrated to Argentina, but he sailed to Europe to enlist in the army and fight for Italy.\n\nMattarella said he chose to pay tribute to him \"because Vittorio Calderoni was Jewish, the youngest of some 400 Italians of Jewish origin who died in the Great War.\" The president said he considered it his duty to note that in the same square where he spoke, late Italian dictator Benito Mussolini delivered a 1938 speech that ushered in \"the dark and tragic\" period of the Fascist regime's anti-Jewish laws.\n\nMattarella encouraged young people to keep an \"active\" memory for the victims of wars as a way to consolidate freedom and harmony as \"irreversible\" choices for Europeans.\n\nIn contrast, Mattarella said, the war demonstrated the \"incapacity of the European ruling class\" to pursue \"national aspirations and interests in a peaceful\" way and to thus surrender to \"aggressive nationalism\" and the desire for power.\n\nRome is a founder of the European Union, the unity of which is being tested by rising nationalist sentiments in several member countries, including Italy, where a populist government took over in June.\n\n___\n\nThomas Adamson in Paris and Luigi Navarra in Redipuglia, Italy, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFrances D'Emilio is on Twitter at www.twitter.com/fdemilio", "Eddie Edwards claims Nancy Pelosi is getting scared.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been nervous since day one. Since I declared my candidacy in April 2017, they\u2019ve been nervous. And it shows right now. Nancy Pelosi has spent well over half-a-million dollars in the last week to try and distort my campaign,\u201d the Republican nominee in New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District said Saturday.\n\nWhile Pelosi might not actually be losing sleep over Edwards\u2019 candidacy, his race does represent somewhat of a wild card among the dozens of competitive House contests being held Tuesday.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the precious few Democrat-held seats Republicans have a chance at flipping, from blue to red. Those open races include battles for Minnesota's 8th District seat, held by a retiring Democratic incumbent; Minnesota's 1st, where incumbent Democrat Tim Walz is running for governor; and Nevada's 3rd, where incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen is running for Senate. Minnesota's 8th, where Republican Pete Stauber faces Democrat Joe Radinovich, is considered perhaps the GOP's best shot to swipe a seat, but a strong performance in the others would give the party at least a chance to defy the odds and hold the chamber.\n\nDemocrats are well aware of the New Hampshire race\u2019s significance among these; in accusing Pelosi of distorting his record, Edwards was referring to a new TV ad by the House Majority PAC, the top outside group that supports Democrats running in congressional elections and is closely tied to House Minority Leader Pelosi.\n\nIn the final week of the New Hampshire campaign, the group shelled out nearly $700,000 to run a TV commercial targeting Edwards on the issue of health care.\n\n\u201cWashington is attacking our health care and Eddie Edwards can\u2019t wait to join the assault,\u201d the narrator warns in the spot.\n\nThe day after the ad hit the airwaves, an Emerson College poll put Edwards just 2 points behind Democratic nominee Chris Pappas, a three-term member of New Hampshire\u2019s Executive Council.\n\nPappas\u2019 advantage was within the survey\u2019s sampling error. Two previous polls showed the Democrat with larger single-digit leads.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve run this whole campaign like we\u2019re a few votes behind,\u201d Pappas told Fox News.\n\nMinutes earlier, speaking to party activists at a canvass kickoff in Manchester, Pappas told the crowd, \u201cThis is a district that is going to help determine what Congress looks like going forward. Whether we\u2019re going to have checks and balances going forward in D.C.\u201d\n\nFor the first time in 16 years, no incumbent is running for re-election for the seat, which has ping-ponged between Democratic and GOP control the past four elections. Sitting Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter is retiring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few quintessential swing districts in the country,\u201d noted Colin Reed, a GOP strategist who ran former Sen. Scott Brown\u2019s 2014 Senate campaign in New Hampshire.\n\nThe Democrat-held district also is one of a handful nationwide that President Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. That\u2019s why Republicans hope the seat can flip from blue to red as they mostly play defense elsewhere in hopes of holding their House majority. A potential pick-up here could be a key factor in whether the party can stave off the kind of Democratic takeover Pelosi, who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel, envisions.\n\nTwo days before voters head to the polls, Democrats are still widely seen as having the edge in the race for House control. The Real Clear Politics map, Fox News' Power Rankings and other race raters all show Pelosi's party better-positioned going into Tuesday.\n\n'It\u2019s one of the few quintessential swing districts in the country.' \u2014 GOP strategist Colin Reed, on New Hampshire's 1st District\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be asked ten or twenty years from now what we were doing in 2018 when our country needed us. We have to be able to answer that question. We have to be able to [say] we knocked on every door that we could, we made every phone call that we could,\u201d said Pappas, who if elected would be New Hampshire\u2019s first gay member of Congress.\n\nIf Edwards wins on Tuesday, he would also make history, as the state\u2019s first black member of Congress. The conservative candidate is a U.S. Navy veteran and former police chief of a small town who also served as the state liquor commission\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.\n\nEdwards was joined Saturday morning at his jam-packed campaign headquarters by Republican Gov. Chris Sununu.\n\n\u201cThose Republicans that were winning are winning by a little more. Those Republicans that were down are now leading by a little bit. The surge is here. It really is,\u201d Sununu touted. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because we spend all this outside money on television ads and that kind of stuff. It\u2019s this. It\u2019s the grassroots support.\u201d\n\nSununu was referring to that House Majority PAC ad, which also alleges: \u201cEdwards supports a disastrous health care plan that would strip protections for pre-existing conditions, increasing the costs of your premiums and prescriptions.\u201d\n\nEdwards argued the commercial was \u201cfull of lies and distortions.\u201d\n\nHe added he\u2019s \u201ctalking about lowering the costs of health care in this country, I talked about pre-existing conditions and protecting pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nReed said the commercial\u2019s a sign Democrats are concerned about holding the seat.\n\n\u201cLook at the money. And the fact that outside third-party groups decided to spend on behalf of Pappas in the last ten days of the election, when resources are the most precious, that tells you this thing is tightening,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile House Majority PAC spent big bucks to help Pappas, neither the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) nor the Congressional Leadership Fund \u2013 the major outside group backing GOP House candidates \u2013 reciprocated.\n\nReed said that Republicans \u201care defending an incredibly large swath of territory and resources get limited. That\u2019s just a reality of life.\u201d\n\nBut he pointed to a silver lining for the GOP candidate: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the worst thing in the world for Eddie Edwards to not be having the outside groups being in New Hampshire on his behalf because it allows him to bolster an independent image.\u201d\n\nPappas also enjoys a sizeable campaign cash advantage over Edwards, telling Fox News, \u201cWe have a significant capacity advantage over the other side to be able to talk to voters, to be able to knock on doors and make phone calls.\u201d\n\nEdwards said he wasn\u2019t concerned with the lack of last-minute outside help.\n\n\u201cThis is New Hampshire. This is all about grassroots, this is all about knocking on doors,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is all about retail politics. That\u2019s what Granite Staters appreciate the most.

If so, vote for Republicans and keep the GOP the majority party in the U.S. House and Senate.\n\nOr do you want to reverse all the progress made on these fronts by President Trump and the Republican Congress over the last two years? Do you want to bring back a poorly performing economy, higher unemployment, higher taxes and a weaker and more problem-plagued America? If so, vote for Democrats.\n\nWe already know that Democrats want to not only repeal the Republican tax cuts, but have plans that would require raising your taxes.\n\nLook no further than the Democrats\u2019 prescription for health care: a single-payer government takeover that would cost a staggering $32.6 trillion over 10 years and end Medicare and Department of Veterans Affairs health care as we know it. Democrats would kick 179 million Americans off of their private health-care plans.\n\nA Republican-led Congress promises policies to keep our country on a path toward prosperity and continue to deliver results for the American people. A House of Representatives controlled by a Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would grind the progress of our nation to a halt and return the country to the economic stagnation and decline of the past.\n\nThe October jobs report shows that our economy continues to boom, thanks to Republican economic policies including tax cuts and a commitment to reducing regulations.\n\nMore than 250,000 jobs were created in October across the U.S., exceeding expectations. What\u2019s more, wages are growing at an annual rate of 3.1 percent \u2013 the fastest pace in nearly a decade. The national unemployment rate in September and October was just 3.7 percent \u2013 the lowest rate since 1969. The U.S. now has more open jobs than job seekers.\n\nHealth care, manufacturing, construction, transportation and warehousing fueled October\u2019s strong job growth. The wage gains are coming at a time of record profits for U.S. companies after we\u2019ve lowered the corporate tax rate from being one of the highest in the world.\n\nWith the Republican-passed tax cuts, Americans are getting to keep more of their hard-earned money.\n\nBecause of Republicans, more people have a shot at the American Dream today than ever before.

If elected, the former Congressman and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture would not only be the first Democratic senator the state\u2019s seen in nearly 40 years, but also the first African American to hold the seat since the late 1800s.\n\nWhile the odds are stacked against him, analysts warn Republicans not to overlook Espy in the crowded special election.\n\nTwo Democrats and two Republicans aim to replace longtime Republican Sen.

Chris McDaniel, a conservative firebrand, in third and political newcomer Tobey Bartee, a Democrat, last.\n\nDallas Breen, director of the Stennis Institute of Government, told Fox News the most crucial thing in this midterm is voter turnout, which Breen said could allow Espy to create cracks in the Republican stronghold of Mississippi.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to win because people like me and everyone else in here are going to get people to go out and vote,\u201d veteran Eugene Horowitz said at a catfish fry campaign event, while sitting next to his wife.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll be able to win because the people are uniting for inclusiveness,\u201d Patricia Horowitz told Fox News over the live blues music.\n\nThe largely African American crowd cheered after Espy spoke about bettering health care and reaching across the aisle in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nWith a 38 percent African American population, the state\u2019s forecasted high turnout could bode well for Espy \u2013 who hopes to garner the same enthusiasm black voters showed President Obama in 2008 and 2012. But Espy promised he\u2019s reaching across race and party lines.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t just win with black votes alone,\u201d Espy said. \u201cI have to win with all votes, white votes, black votes, doesn\u2019t matter to me.

As a result, Breen said, Democrats in Mississippi aren\u2019t driven to polls with the same force.\n\nHyde-Smith\u2019s steepest criticism draws from her past as a Democrat, switching parties in 2010.\n\nHer leading opponent, Espy, is also taking heat.

Many admitted they would vote for Hyde-Smith if there was a runoff between the incumbent and Espy, which means Espy\u2019s steep climb to a victory will become even steeper.\n\nWhile unlikely, Mississippi\u2019s special election could potentially be the key to whether Republicans or Democrats control the Senate \u2013 a determination that may have to wait until after Thanksgiving if one candidate does not earn a majority of the vote on Nov. 6 in the Magnolia State.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even speculate what those three weeks would look like in the state if that were the case,\u201d Breen smiled. \u201cIt would definitely be a first in my time on this earth to see something like that [in Mississippi].\u201d", "Neil Armstrong\u2019s personal collection of memorabilia has taken flight.\n\nCollectibles that belonged to the first man to set foot on the moon were sold in a recent auction held by the Dallas-based auction house Heritage Auctions.\n\nThe company held its \u201cSpace Collection Signature Auction\u201d from Thursday to Saturday, which included items from the Armstrong Family Collection.\n\nHeritage Auctions says his spacecraft ID plate from Apollo 11\u2019s lunar module Eagle went for $468,500 -- making it the highest-selling item.\n\nThe company offered details about the item in an online listing.\n\n\u201cThree of these Lunar Module-5 Identification Plates were flown to the moon on Apollo 11 and returned to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp,\u201d Heritage Auctions explained. \u201cThey then mounted each ID plate on a wall plaque and one was presented to each crewmember.\u201d\n\nELON MUSK SAYS HE 'LIKES THE IDEA' OF TRUMP'S SPACE FORCE\n\nArmstrong, who died in 2012, was joined on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969 by astronauts Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin.\n\nA U.S. flag that the astronaut took with him to the moon, meanwhile, went for $275,000.\n\nMemorabilia that belonged to Armstrong that wasn\u2019t part of the famous mission was also featured in the auction.\n\nNASA IS TEAMING UP WITH A CALIFORNIA SHOE COMPANY TO COMMEMORATE ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nOne of those items -- the flight suit Armstrong wore aboard Gemini 8, the 1966 mission that performed the first docking of two spacecraft in flight -- brought the astronaut's family $109,375.\n\nAnother, Armstrong's 1970 Hasselblad 500C camera, was sold for $25,000, per the auction house.\n\n\u201cThe entire total sale brought more than $7.4 million,\u201d Eric Bradley, the director of public relations for Heritage Auctions, told Fox News in an email. \u201cJust the Armstrong items alone brought more than $5.2 million.\u201d\n\nFans will be able to bid on more of Armstrong's items in two auctions slated to take place in May and November 2019, the auction house said in July.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Play Audio Clip Listen to audio clip.\n\nAnd down the stretch they come...\n\nDana Perino, former White House Press Secretary, co-host of Fox News Channel's \"The Five\" and host of \"The Daily Briefing\" and Chris Stirewalt Fox News Politics Editor and host of \"Power Play\", run through the daily goings on in the world of politics.\n\nOn a special episode of I'll Tell You What, Dana and Chris discuss the many questions surrounding this Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\nLISTEN to \"Perino & Stirewalt: I'll Tell You What\":", "Retail giant Amazon Inc. is in \"advanced talks\" to open its second headquarters in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, The Washington Post reported Saturday.\n\nAmazon, based in Seattle, is apparently seriously considering an area known as Crystal City. It's a large residential and office complex in Arlington, Virginia, just south of Washington, the Post said, citing unidentified sources.\n\nAmazon announced last year that the retail giant was looking to open a second headquarters somewhere in North America, bringing with it as many as 50,000 new jobs. Several state and local governments threw their hats in the ring, offering Amazon millions in tax incentives if they opened their new headquarters in their city.\n\nThe Washington metropolitan area was long considered a top contender for Amazon's second headquarters. Company founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos already had several connections to the Washington area. He's the owner of The Washington Post and owns a home in the area. When the company announced a list of 20 top contenders in January, it included both Washington as well as Montgomery County, Maryland, which is just north of D.C.\n\nAMAZON ALEXA WILL NOW GIVE YOU MIDTERM ELECTION INFORMATION\n\nCrystal City is served by a mass transit system and major highways, both qualifications that Amazon has said is required for its new headquarters as well.\n\nBecause Amazon is reportedly in \"advanced talks\" does not mean the deal is certain. Shortly after the Post published its story, Mike Grella, Amazon's economic development director posted on Twitter, \"Memo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City, VA as #HQ2 selection. You're not doing Crystal City, VA any favors.\"", "President Trump is continuing to put pressure on the government of Venezuela\u2019s leftist President Nicolas Maduro, introducing a new round of sanctions designed to further rattle the embattled South American country\u2019s oil exports.\n\nTrump\u2019s National Security Adviser John Bolton revealed that the president signed an executive order on Thursday to prohibit anyone in the U.S. from doing business with entities and individuals involved with \u201ccorrupt and deceptive\u201d gold dealings from Venezuela, declaring that the Maduro regime \u201chas used this sector as a bastion to finance illicit activities, to fill its coffers, and to support criminal groups.\u201d\n\nBolton made the revelations late last week while addressing a crowd of mostly Cuban-Americans and other Hispanics at the Freedom Tower in Miami, Florida \u2013 the place where Cuban refugees were embraced in the 1960s in the aftermath of Fidel Castro\u2019s revolt.\n\nOver the past three years, more than 2 million Venezuelans have fled the country \u2013 creating a mass migration crisis that has threatened to destabilize Latin America. Food and medicine are said to be increasingly scarce across the country, with the UN calling it one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.\n\nThe new sanctions only add to the already thick slate of restrictions \u2013 of which 70 Venezuelan individuals and entities, including the president and his wife, are banned from traveling to the U.S. or doing business with Americans or American companies.\n\nThe ailing nation this year turned to gold as a means of invigorating its fast-falling currency and moving away from oil dependency. Maduro declared war on illegal mining across the country, but his critics contend that the government continues to garner the rewards of the illicit gold trade.\n\nIn apprehension of U.S. regulations, in the first nine months of the year Venezuela exported some $900 million worth of gold through Turkey. Maduro has since responded publicly to the sanctions announcement, calling them \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cschizophrenic\u201d in a televised statement. He stressed that Venezuela would not bow to U.S. imperialism, and insisted that a colossal mining project planned for 2019 would go ahead \u2013 financed by both public and private sectors \u2013 and generate $5 billion annually.\n\nMaduro has consistently denied being at the root of any economic woes in Venezuela and instead blamed U.S.-backed adversaries and opposition leaders for waging fiscal wars and plotting to assassinate him.\n\nVENEZUELAN OPPOSITION LEADER LAMENTS \"GENOCIDE\" IN HIS COUNTRY, REVEALS HIS ESCAPE FROM DETAINMENT\n\nQUESTIONS ARISE OVER POLITICS, MOTIVATION OF CARAVAN ORGANIZERS\n\nBolton also emphasized that the new clampdown was part of a larger promise to punish and isolate Latin America\u2019s \u201ctroika of tyranny\u201d \u2013 pointing the finger at Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua \u2013 for disruptive and hostile behavior in the region. Bolton accused Cuba of supporting Maduro\u2019s reign of terror in Venezuela and said that \u201cwithin days\u201d the State Department would also be adding more than two dozen Cuban organizations to a ban list given their ties to the country\u2019s military and intelligence wings.\n\nThe Trump administration has endeavored to take a much harder line against the Cuban government and scale back some of Obama\u2019s 2014 policies after restoring diplomatic relations.\n\nMoreover, Bolton took aim at Nicaragua\u2019s left-leaning leader Daniel Ortega for persecuting political opponents, vowing that the government \u201cwill feel the full weight of America\u2019s robust sanctions regime.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has shored up relations with right-sided regional leaders, including the governments of Colombia, Chile and the newly-elected President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.

The daily trek will be one of the longest yet, as the exhausted group of travelers tries to make progress any way they can.\n\nThe journey now appears to be taking its toll.\n\nA day prior, the group was beset by divisions as some migrants argued with caravan organizers and criticized Mexican officials before setting out on their own toward Puebla and Mexico City. Many are fighting off blistered feet and coughs.\n\nIt remained to be seen if the main contingent will continue directly north through the Gulf coast state of Veracruz or veer slightly westward and make a stop in the country's capital.\n\nMynor Chavez is a 19-year-old migrant who said he could not get ahead in his home country.\n\n\"I have no hope.

The driver then gave a reluctant wave of the hand, one of the nuns spoke and dozens of young men ran to the rear to open the two tall metal doors.\n\nAn organizer appeared with a bullhorn, and loaded dozens of women and children and strollers inside. As soon as that truck left, with one door tied open, another approached. And again the nuns convinced him to fill his empty trailer with migrants.\n\nTheir destination Sunday is Cordoba, the city of Puebla on Monday and Mexico City by Tuesday.

The two are vying to replace term-limited GOP Gov. Nathan Deal, and Abrams could become the state's first black governor. Kemp has the backing of Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker, while Abrams boasts the endorsement of Oprah Winfrey.\n\nKemp has previously said he wouldn't recuse himself as Georgia's secretary of state if his race with Abrams goes to a recount, even though his office would be overseeing that process.\n\n\"This political stunt from Kemp just days before the election is yet another example of why he cannot be trusted and should not be overseeing an election in which he is also a candidate for governor,\" the Georgia Democratic Party's executive director, Rebecca DeHart, said in a statement.\n\n\"Georgians of all political stripes are very concerned about election security and the security of Georgians' personal information,\" DeHart added in a fresh statement later in the day. \"The Democratic Party of Georgia shares that concern, but we did not create, discover, or attempt to take advantage of the deeply vulnerable system used by the Secretary of State's office.\"\n\nShe continued: \"As Kemp aims to deflect blame for his failures, the questions everyone must be asking is: Why was the system vulnerable in the first place? Why has Brian Kemp still not taken basic steps to secure Georgians' personal information?\"\n\nDeHart charged that, in 2016, \"Kemp was one of the only secretaries of state in the country to refuse help from the Department of Homeland Security to improve election security, leaving Georgians vulnerable to foreign cyber attacks.\"\n\nTRUMP'S INTEL DIRECTOR WARNS OF 'CYBER-9/11,' MASSIVE ATTACK ON POWER GRID\n\nKemp, at the time, accused the Obama administration of a power grab when he refused that assistance, saying the federal government should stay out of Georgia's affairs. \"The question remains whether the federal government will subvert the Constitution to achieve the goal of federalizing elections under the guise of security,\" Kemp said in 2016.\n\nSpeaking Sunday to CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Abrams echoed DeHart's criticism, and accused Kemp of repeatedly attempting to suppress votes.\n\n\"I've heard nothing about it, and my reaction would be that this is a desperate attempt on the part of my opponent to distract people from the fact that two different federal judges found him derelict in his duties and have forced him to accept absentee ballots to be counted and those who are being held captive by the exact match system to be allowed to vote,\" Abrams told host Jake Tapper.\n\nGEORGIA UNDER SCRUTINY FOR ALLEGED VOTER SUPPRESSION -- WHAT'S GOING ON?\n\nOn Friday, a federal judge upheld an injunction against Kemp's implementation of the state's \"Exact Match\" voting law, which required voters whose registrations differed even slightly from their identifications to provide additional verification and led officials to throw out many absentee ballots that didn't match up. Under Kemp, there were also stringent requirements on people suspected of being in the country illegally.\n\nThe injunction requires Kemp to change the state's procedures to allow more than 3,100 people prove their citizenship more easily, such as by showing a U.S. passport or other documentation -- and only to a poll manager.\n\nAbrams called on Kemp to resign after a report last month that approximately 50,000 voter registration applications were on hold in Georgia, including roughly 36,000 sent in by black voters.\n\nU.S. District Judge Eleanor L. Ross said Kemp's system posed \u201cgrave concerns for the Court about the differential treatment inflicted on a group of individuals who are predominantly minorities.\"\n\n\"He is desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures.\" \u2014 Democratic Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams\n\n\"He is desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures, from his refusal to honor his commitments and from the fact that he's part of a nationwide system of voter suppression that will not work in this election because we're going to outwork him, we're going to outvote him and we're going to win,\" Abrams added.\n\nSTATE OF THE MIDTERMS: NEW POLL GIVES GOP MORE HOPE IN SENATE WITH JUST 48 HOURS UNTIL ELECTION DAY\n\nPresident Trump is set to host a rally Sunday afternoon in Macon, Georgia.

At stake,\n\nwhether Republicans will hold onto control of Congress should one or both\n\nchambers flip, Democrats will be able to block much of President Trump's\n\nagenda and launch investigations into his administration.\n\nBut if the GOP keeps its majorities in the House and the Senate, that would\n\nbuck traditional losses for the president's party in the first midterm,\n\nwell, then, Mr. Trump will be in a more commanding position than ever.\n\nWe begin our coverage of the battle for Congress two days out with Peter\n\nDoocy on the campaign trail in Hialeah, Florida, Peter.\n\nPETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Chris.\n\nDemocrats believe they have built the biggest battlefield for the House in\n\na decade and party leaders say it's about to pay off.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D\u2014CALIF., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We will win.\n\nDOOCY: Democratic challengers everywhere are sticking to a single focus,\n\nhealth care.\n\nABBY FINKENAUER, D\u2014IA., U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: One week to prove we\n\nare in Iowa that steps up for our neighbors with pre-existing conditions.\n\nDOOCY: Vulnerable Republicans believe that if there's one issue that helps\n\nthem hold the House, it's the strong economy.\n\nREP. DAVID YOUNG, R\u2014IA.: Keeping the economy going, trade is a\n\nbig part of that.\n\nDOOCY: A critical constituency in the battle for the House, women.\n\nREP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, R\u2014WASH.: I do see some\n\nfalling off among the college-educated women.\n\nDOOCY: President Trump is more outwardly optimistic.\n\nTRUMP: It looks like we're doing okay in the House. We are going to have\n\nto see.\n\nDOOCY: The Senate map is tougher for Democrats, especially the ten\n\ndepending seats in states Trump won.\n\nSEN. JOE MANCHIN, D\u2014W. VA.: What really comes down to is who\n\ndo you trust?\n\nDOOCY: A huge focus for Republican Senate hopefuls, immigration.\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ, R\u2014TEXAS: You mean the people of Texas want a wall?\n\nYou mean the people of Texas want to stop the caravan?\n\nDOOCY: President Trump has made repeated visits to red states with\n\nDemocratic senators for sizable rallies.\n\nTRUMP: Hello, Montana. I said I was coming back, and I'm back.\n\nDOOCY: Rallies some of those Democrats are trying to laugh off.\n\nSEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL, D\u2014MO.: He's been here so often, he must\n\nbe building a golf course.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nDOOCY: Millions of people in places like Florida have already voted, so\n\nRepublican Senate candidate Rick Scott is out here taking orders and asking\n\nfor votes before Tuesday -- Chris.\n\nWALLACE: Peter Doocy reporting from Florida -- Peter, thanks for that.\n\nJoining me now, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, who leads the Democrats'\n\neffort to take back control of the Senate.\n\nSenator, this was always going to be a tough year for Democrats. You're\n\ndefending 26 seats this year in the midterms while Republicans only have\n\nnine Senate seats up and 10 Senate Democrats are running in states\n\nPresident Trump won in 2016, many by 20 or 30 points.\n\nSo, realistically, don't Republicans have a better chance of not only\n\nholding a majority, but adding to it than you do of flipping the Senate?\n\nSEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, D--MD., DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE\n\nCHAIRMAN: Well, Chris, you're absolutely right. This is the toughest\n\npolitical map any one party has faced in 60 years and if you were to have\n\nasked people year and a half ago where we would be, you would not even be\n\nasking the question about whether or not we have a path to a Senate\n\nDemocratic majority.\n\nThe answer is we do have a path. It is a very narrow path as you indicate,\n\nbut the fact that we are as competitive as we are is a real testament to\n\nour senators and our candidates who have always said that their North Star\n\nis standing up for the people of their state. So, that's the first and\n\nforemost priority and that's what they've been doing.\n\nWALLACE: All right. So give me your two best chances to pick off\n\nRepublican Senate seats. Where are they? And in fact, isn't at least one\n\nof your Democratic senators, Heitkamp in North Dakota, isn't she in\n\ntrouble?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Well, first of all, never count out Heidi Heitkamp. People\n\ndid that six years ago when she was 10 points behind. She won that race.\n\nShe's less than ten points behind right now. That's a lesson everybody has\n\nlearned. Don't her out.\n\nIn terms of the Republican seats that are very competitive right now,\n\nNevada, Arizona, Tennessee, Texas. Mississippi may go to a special runoff.\n\nAnd the reason is that you've got Republicans running in the states who\n\nhave betrayed their voters primarily on the issue that is the top of mind\n\nfor voters on the country, which is health care issues and taking away\n\nprotections for people who have pre-existing health conditions.\n\nWALLACE: President Trump is hitting Democrats hard in these final days on\n\nimmigration and the caravan headed up through Mexico. Here he is on the\n\ncampaign trail.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A Democrat victory on\n\nelection day would be a bright flashing invitation to traffickers,\n\nsmugglers, drug dealers and gang members all over the world, come on in.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: And the president ran a controversial ad this week about a\n\nMexican who was deported twice, came back into this country and then shot\n\nand killed two California police officers. Here's a bit of the presidents\n\nclip.\n\n(POLITICAL AD PLAYS)\n\nWALLACE: Senator, I'm sure you don't like the tone, but isn't it working?\n\nRepublicans in red states say immigration is now a top issue.\n\nVAN HOLLEN: I don't think it's working, Chris, because what the president\n\nis doing is driving away the independent voters and swing voters and a lot\n\nof moderate Republican voters in these swing states.\n\nLook, the president says lots of outrageous and untrue things and there's\n\nanother example right there. The reality is Democrats are for strong\n\nborder security. We're against open borders.\n\nWe are also against separating parents and their children, and it was\n\npretty outrageous for the president to suggest the other day that the\n\nUnited States military would fire on unarmed people and that the military\n\nhad to tell the president that's not what we do, that's not what the United\n\nStates military does, but the real thing going on here, Chris, is an effort\n\nto change the national conversation from what people wake up every day\n\nthinking about, which are there economic circumstances and primarily\n\nuncertainty over health care costs and the fact that Republicans for the\n\nlast two years have tried to eliminate protections for people with pre-\n\nexisting conditions. That remains the top issue on voters' mind despite\n\nall the president's efforts.\n\nWALLACE: Well, you talk about the economy and then you segue into health\n\ncare, but let's talk about the economy because Republicans have a -- have a\n\npretty good story to tell there. Let's put up the numbers: 250,000 jobs\n\ncreated in this last jobs report for October. Unemployment at 3.7 percent.\n\nWage growth, the highest since 2009.\n\nIsn't that a strong economic record for Republicans to run on?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Well, Chris, I think voters know that the economy was on this\n\nupward trajectory long before President Trump was sworn in. We saw growing\n\njob growth, lower unemployment and interestingly, when you look at real\n\nwages, real wage growth was stronger in the last term of the Obama\n\nadministration then in this term so far of the Trump administration.\n\nThat's because even as wages have gone up, so have costs, like the cost of\n\nhealth care.\n\nSo, for most Americans out there, they are actually not seeing their real\n\nwages keep pace and in fact they were keeping pace at a faster rate under\n\nthe Obama administration. That is why people are focused on this issue of\n\nhealth care and the uncertainty that the Republican plan to eliminate\n\nprotections will bring.\n\nWALLACE: I've got 15 seconds left. Yes or no, are you going to take the\n\nSenate back?\n\nVAN HOLLEN: We have too many close races, Chris, and you know it's all\n\nabout turnout.\n\nHere's what I would say: the early vote in states like Nevada and Arizona\n\nhas been very strong. It does appear young voters are coming out. And it\n\nlooks like the president's effort to distract voters from the real issues\n\nthey care about like health care and like the Republican efforts to take\n\naway protections for pre-existing conditions is not working.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Van Hollen, thank you. Thanks for taking time from the\n\ncampaign trail to talk with us, sir.\n\nVAN HOLLEN: Good to be with you, Chris. Thanks.\n\nWALLACE: Now let's turn to North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, vice chair\n\nof the Senate Republican campaign effort.\n\nSo, Senator, let me start with you where I ended with Van Hollen. Are you\n\ngoing to hold onto the Senate on Tuesday night, if so what's your new\n\nmajority going to be? And give me your two best shots and picking off\n\nDemocratic seats.\n\nSEN. THOM TILLIS, R\u2014N.C., NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE VICE\n\nCHAIR: We're not only going to hold a majority, I think we're going to add\n\nto it. I believe that states like North Dakota, Indiana, Missouri are all\n\ntrending in a positive direction. Our incumbents are doing very well.\n\nThere may be a special election in Mississippi that will take another three\n\nweeks to sort out but I'm also confident that we'll have a Republican\n\ncoming back in that state.\n\nThe map looks very good to us in about five or six different states and\n\nSenator Van Hollen knows that. They've got a tough call and I think we are\n\ngoing to come out successful on Tuesday.\n\nWALLACE: As I discussed with the Senator Van Hollen, President Trump this\n\nlast few weeks has been making immigration and the caravan coming up from\n\nMexico his top issue. Here he was earlier this week talking about a\n\npossible confrontation between the migrants and the thousands of soldiers\n\nhe is sending to the southern border. Here's the president.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: They want to throw rocks at\n\nour military, our military fights back. We're going to consider and I told\n\nthem consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the\n\nMexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Now, the president walked out back on Friday saying he was\n\ntalking about making arrests of the migrants, not shooting them. But no\n\nconcerns on your part about the president's rhetoric and some of the\n\nactions he's taking on the southern border potentially turning off\n\nindependents and moderate Republicans?\n\nTILLIS: Well, what the American people need to know that our men and women\n\nin uniform are some of the most disciplined, trained professionals in the\n\nhistory of warfare. They're going to treat those members of the caravan\n\nwith respect, but the president is right that we have to secure the border\n\nand I think that putting troops down there to make it very clear that we\n\nwant people who have a legitimate claim to asylum to come through the\n\nprocess and get that asylum granted. This caravan is not the way to do it,\n\nand I think the American people are concerned with it.\n\nYou can see the change in the rhetoric on the part of our colleagues on the\n\nother side of the aisle from -- well, just let them across the border to\n\nnow discussing the president's tactics. I believe that the president is\n\nright and doing everything he can to stop the illegal crossings.\n\nWALLACE: Senator, Republicans have a great story to tell in the economy\n\nbut the president doesn't seem especially focused on that.\n\nHere he is at a rally on Friday.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We have the greatest economy in the history of our country, but\n\nsometimes that's not as exciting to talk about the economy, right?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: In reaction, a top aide to Republicans, Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted\n\nthis almost plaintively. We are going to spend all day and weekend talking\n\nabout the strong economy, right?\n\nAnd Republican Congressman Ryan Costello, who's retiring, accuses the\n\npresident of political malpractice.\n\nQuestion, are you sure that focusing on immigration over the economy is\n\nreally the right strategy, the best strategy for Republicans?\n\nTILLIS: Well, I think people are taking 30-second sound bites. I was at a\n\nrally here in Charlotte a week ago, and the president spent a good portion\n\nof his speech talking about 7 million jobs created. One of the strongest\n\nand fastest growing economies we've seen in decades. Record unemployment\n\nfor African-American community, for the Hispanic community.\n\nHe's spending a lot of his time on that, but when you have to boil it down\n\nto 15 or 30-sound bites, they're going to pick the piece that seems like he\n\nis not talking about that.\n\nLet me tell you about something else. He also spends a lot of time on the\n\nstump talking about how we have to protect pre-existing conditions and it's\n\na false narrative for Democrats to come in and say if you like Republicans\n\nwe are going to take that away, we are doing everything we can, including\n\nmyself. I filed a bill to make sure that we protect pre-existing\n\nconditions.\n\nIf people look at the totality of an hour, hour and 15-minute long speech,\n\nyou're going to see the president spent the bulk of the time talking about\n\nreduce regulations, increase jobs, reduce unemployment, better stature\n\nagainst NATO, taking North Korea and taking China to task on their bad\n\nbehaviors -- all that comes out in his speech.\n\nWALLACE: Well, you have taken us directly in the direction I wanted to go,\n\nwhich is health care, which Democrats are making their top issue and here\n\nis former President Obama on the campaign trail this week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: When I was president, Republicans voted\n\nmore than a dozen times to get rid of protections for people with pre-\n\nexisting conditions. Last year, they fell one vote short. One vote. If\n\nthey win back this Tuesday, they will finally succeed.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Senator, the fact is that the repeal and replace bill with\n\nRepublicans pushed repeatedly significantly reduced protections for people\n\nwith pre-existing conditions.\n\nTILLIS: Well, Chris, that's actually one of the reasons why I think it was\n\na courageous vote. The first thing we have to do is take out the\n\nunderpinnings of the Affordable Care Act so that we can put a health care\n\npolicy in place that's sustainable.\n\nWhat Senator Van Hollen failed to mention about rising premiums over the\n\npast few years is that we've significantly reduced the rate of growth and\n\none of the reasons why that growth has spiraled over the years because of\n\nthe Affordable Care Act. We want to replace the Affordable Care Act with a\n\nprogram that will work, that will provide people who have pre-existing\n\nconditions with health care, that will allow young adults under the age of\n\n26 to be on their parents health care policies but something that will\n\nwork, because if we continue down this path, we're going to have a health\n\ncare crisis, not only among those who are serviced by the Affordable Care\n\nAct, but the broader health care market in this country is headed for\n\ndisaster if we don't recognize we've got to fix it.\n\nWALLACE: But, Senator, and I've only got about 30 seconds here. I don't\n\nwant to get too deeply in the weeds, but repeal and replace bill would have\n\nallowed states to get waivers for Obamacare and take people with pre-\n\nexisting conditions and put them in risk pools where they would have to pay\n\na higher premium. And your bill, yes, it says we are going to cover\n\neverybody with pre-existing conditions, but we're not necessarily going to\n\ncover the condition that they have that's pre-existing. So, yes, we'll\n\ncover people who have cancer, but we won't necessarily -- their insurance\n\nwon't cover cancer treatment.\n\nTILLIS: Even -- even if some states opted not to cover, not covering the\n\nway we would want them to, I think they would get unelected very quickly.\n\nThis is a very popular policy with the American people which is exactly\n\nwhere the Democrats are trying to create this false narrative that people\n\nin Washington and the statehouses want to take it away. I simply don't see\n\nany path either on the basis of good policy or good politics.\n\nSo people with pre-existing conditions are going to get covered and our\n\nRepublican majority that we're going to secure next week is going to work\n\nto that end.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Tillis, thank you. Thanks for your time.\n\nTILLIS: Thank you, Chris.\n\nWALLACE: And we'll be following how the world turns on Tuesday night.\n\nTILLIS: It'll be a great night.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the battle\n\nfor control of the Congress with just two days to go.\n\nPlus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump's efforts\n\nto fire up his base? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and\n\nwe may use your question on the air.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We're the only country in\n\nthe world where a person comes in, has a baby and the baby is essentially a\n\ncitizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits.\n\nWe have about 5,008, we will go up anywhere between ten and 15,000 military\n\npersonnel, on top of Border Patrol, ICE and everybody else at the border.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: President Trump upping the ante for how\n\nhe'll stop that migrant caravan coming from Mexico, talking about sending\n\nmore troops to the border, changing asylum laws and even ending birthright\n\ncitizenship.\n\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group. Fox News senior political analyst\n\nBrit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, co-host of \"Henson and\n\nHarf\" on Fox News Radio, Marie Harf, and GOP strategist Karl Rove.\n\nWell, Karl, let me start with you. Is immigration the best issue for this\n\npresident to be pushing in the midterms to try to hold onto control of both\n\nthe Senate and the House?\n\nKARL ROVE, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE ADVISER: Well, on Friday, Gallup found\n\nthat 80 percent of the American people thought the economy was extremely\n\nimportant -- excuse me, health care, and 78 percent found that the economy\n\nand immigration were extremely important. So these three issues are all\n\nsort of stuck right there.\n\nImmigration helps only if the Democrats screw it up. For example, Sinema\n\nin Arizona and McCaskill in Missouri both support the president sending\n\ntroops to the border.\n\nOn the other hand, in Tennessee, I saw a poll in Tennessee, 62 percent of\n\nTennesseans are concerned about it, 27 percent are not. Bredesen, the\n\nDemocratic nominee said this is not a problem and he thereby created a\n\nproblem for himself.\n\nIn Texas, Ted Cruz is beating up Robert Francis O'Rourke over the issue --\n\nWALLACE: I love it. He keeps saying Robert Francis O'Rourke because you\n\nhate to say Beto O'Rourke.\n\nROVE: No, it's Beto, Beto.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nROVE: Beto O'Rourke. I'll say, as you like, I'll use --\n\nWALLACE: I kind of like it. It's nice.\n\nROVE: So, Rafael Cruz is beating up Robert Francis O'Rourke on the issue\n\nof immigration because O'Rourke refuses to say that he opposes those\n\ncaravans coming across the border, and apparently, his campaign provided\n\nfinancial support to the caravan, which may be in violation of U.S. law.\n\nBut anyway, where the Democrats screw it up, it's a problem for `em.\n\nWALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on\n\nFacebook from Mike Peterson. Why aren't Republicans driving home the\n\nmessage on the economy?\n\nBRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I'll tell you why.\n\nWALLACE: Pardon?\n\nHUME: I'll tell you why.\n\nWALLACE: Well, I was going to ask Marie. But you can definitely --\n\nMARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: Go for it.\n\nWALLACE: You know what? Go ahead.\n\nHARF: Yes.\n\nHUME: Anger, disappointment, outrage are much more powerful vote\n\nmotivators than satisfaction. People are no doubt satisfied with the\n\neconomy. Unless you can scare them successfully into believing that all\n\nthe good things that have happened in the economy will be taken away if\n\nyour opponent wins, you may well be better off trying to motivate voters by\n\ntalking about something that they're angry about.\n\nWALLACE: Do you agree with that? I mean, we always hear peace and\n\nprosperity. Clinton, '92, it's the economy, stupid. I guess I'm just\n\nsurprised, and yes, the president does mention it --\n\nHARF: Yes.\n\nWALLACE: -- the focus on immigration to the exclusion to some degree of\n\nthe economy.\n\nHARF: Well, I think it's an open question whether the Trump 2016 playbook\n\nthat he's now sort of using us as his closing argument will actually work\n\nwhen he's not on the ballot, when there's a lot of independents and women\n\nwho have had two years to get really angry about his rhetoric and when he\n\ndoesn't have Hillary as a foil.\n\nI think that this closing argument based on immigration, Chris, will -- may\n\nhelp them keep a narrow set of Senate seats, but I think it definitely\n\nhurts when you're talking about the House, when you're talking about the\n\nswing districts.\n\nAnd let's not forget, the tax cuts are still not pulling very well. Many\n\npeople in states and districts that the Republicans need to keep, the tax\n\ncuts are popular, the tariffs are popular. So I don't know whether the\n\nclosing argument that Trump is using will work. If it does it will be in a\n\nnarrow set of places and I do not think it will keep the House for the\n\nRepublicans. I actually think it will help deliver the House to the\n\nDemocrats.\n\nWALLACE: The first midterm election after a new president is historically\n\ntough for the party of the new president. Let's put up some numbers.\n\nSince World War II, the president's party loses an average of 28 seats in\n\nthe House in the first midterm, and between two and three seats in the\n\nSenate.\n\nJuan, how do you think President Trump is doing in trying to break that\n\nhistoric tradition?\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the one advantage\n\nshe has is that he has had an unerring base here, and that base is about 40\n\npercent of the vote, people who approve of his presidency. And when it\n\ncomes to Republicans, he's up to 80 to 90 percent of Republicans backing\n\nfrom. I think it's become the party of Trump.\n\nSo what he's done, Chris, in this cycle, and you can look at this travel\n\nitinerary over the last few days, you can see he's going to red states and\n\nhe's trying to excite red from voters. And that's where the immigration\n\nmethod comes in. That's where he thinks that message has tremendous\n\nimpact.\n\nIt does not, as Marie was saying, have tremendous impact, though, with a\n\nlot of the white female voters, especially in the suburban areas that are\n\nso critical in terms of the House races. I think you will see a difference\n\nthere.\n\nAnd on a larger scale I think, if you look at the advertising over the last\n\nfew days, almost none of it has to do with the economy, which is kind of\n\nshocking because as you pointed out, the economy is doing fairly well, why\n\nwouldn't Republicans be running on it? Instead, you see the Republican\n\nSenate and House candidates actually following the president's lead and\n\ngoing with the immigration red meat culture war issue. And again, it might\n\nwork with the base but it doesn't work with independents --\n\nWALLACE: Let me just say, the one person in this panel who has actually\n\nhelped elect a president and did it twice is shaking his head.\n\nI want to ask you this specific question, though, because this is the\n\nconventional wisdom out there, it's going to help in red states electing\n\nRepublican senators. It's going to hurt in the House races especially in\n\nsuburban districts with better educated people and with suburban women.\n\nTrue or false?\n\nROVE: False. Again, it matters how it gets handled. Is it going to help\n\nin some congressional districts? Yes, the president is going to West\n\nVirginia three, which is a battleground district. It's going to help\n\nthere.\n\nIs he going to Illinois six? Peter Roskam? No, but Peter Roskam wants to\n\nmake the final issue the economy and his stewardship of the economy. His\n\nstewardship, what he has done as a congressman to make a good economy.\n\nI think the White House has been very adroit and how it's deployed the\n\npresident as it comes down to the final stages here.\n\nLet's be clear, no campaign -- this is not a campaign in these individual\n\nstates dominated by the issues. I'm not seeing candidates in Nevada or\n\nArizona or Missouri or North Dakota or Indiana running one kind of ad, they\n\nare running different kinds of ads that appeal to their individual states\n\nand they tend to be more about the economy and judges than they tend to be\n\n--\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWILLIAMS: What you see is the ad the Democrats are running are consistent\n\nin terms of message discipline, on health care. The president can't even\n\ngo to Arizona, can't go to Nevada.\n\nROVE: He's been to both states.\n\nWILLIAMS: No, but he's not going there, I'm talking about now. The\n\nspreads --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Wait, gentlemen, I've got about a minute left here and I want to\n\nask the guru one more question.\n\nEarly voting, we are seeing these historically high numbers, as of Friday,\n\n28 million people had voted early. Question: is it that people are more\n\nenthused and intense? Is it just because there's more early voting and\n\nmore opportunity than there used to be? And to the degree -- and you can't\n\nget me into the weeds here because I've got a minute left.\n\nNo, but here -- is it showing a trend?\n\nROVE: Yes. Bigger almost everywhere. Thirty-seven states voted early and\n\nit is -- we are going to have the biggest turn out in midterms since 1966\n\nand it's roughly between like in Arizona 53 percent of the 2016 turnout,\n\nFlorida 68 percent of the turnout.\n\nWALLACE: So, what's the reason and who's it helping?\n\nROVE: Well, part of it is it is getting to be easier and people are\n\nfalling into the habit, but the main driver is people are wildly\n\nenthusiastic about coming out and voting, and Republicans are doing\n\nsurprisingly well. In Arizona, a 7.9 percent advantage of the turnout in a\n\nstate that they won last time around by three and a half points. Florida,\n\na 2.8 percent swing towards Republicans and early voting in a state they\n\nwon by 1.2 percent. Nevada, a 1.85 percent swing to Republicans in a state\n\nthey lost by 2.45 last time around.\n\nWALLACE: I am so glad we did not get into the weeds. But that was great\n\nand it's very interesting because you always wonder -- one last quick\n\nquestion, is this -- people voting who would have voted on election day\n\nanyway, and they are just transferring or is this new voters?\n\nROVE: We don't know but in some places there is evidence that it is\n\nepisodic -- that there are episodic midterm voters and my sense is if you\n\ngot this big in the early voting, we're going to see a lot of people who\n\ntend not to vote in midterms show up.\n\nWALLACE: OK. We have to take a little break here. We'll see you all a\n\nlittle later.\n\nUp next, the White House is re-imposing sanctions on Iran as it pulls out\n\nof the nuclear deal. But some hardliners say President Trump is not being\n\ntough enough on Tehran. We'll talk live with the Secretary of State Mike\n\nPompeo, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Coming up, the Trump administration re-imposes economic sanctions\n\non Iran lifted by President Obama as part of the nuclear deal.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We now have in place that\n\ntoughest ever sanctions on a corrupt regime in Iran.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo what it means for U.S.\n\nrelations in the region, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: The Trump administration has announced the remaining sanctions\n\nthat were lifted as part of a 2015 Iran nuclear deal will be re-imposed on\n\nMonday, one day before the midterms. President Trump drove home the point\n\nFriday when he tweeted this photo with the word \"sanctions are coming,\" a\n\nnod to \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nJoining me now live from the State Department, Secretary of State Mike\n\nPompeo.\n\nMr. Secretary, welcome back to \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\nMIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: Good morning, Chris. Great to be with you\n\ntoday.\n\nWALLACE: Your re-imposing, as we said, all U.S. sanctions on Iran, but\n\nyou're giving exemptions to eight countries to allow them to keep buying\n\noil from Tehran.\n\nQuestion, why?\n\nPOMPEO: Well, Chris, the sanctions that will be re-imposed tomorrow are the\n\ntoughest sanctions ever put in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nThey're aimed at a singular purpose, denying the world's largest state\n\nsponsor of terrorists the capacity to do things like they did this past\n\ncouple weeks, attempted assassination campaign in the heart of Europe.\n\nThese sanctions have already had an enormous impact. We've already reduced\n\nIranian crude oil experts by over a million barrels per day. That number\n\nwill fall farther. There's a handful of places were countries that have --\n\nthat have already made significant reductions in their crude oil exports\n\nneed a little bit more time to get to zero, and we're going to provide that\n\nto them.\n\nWALLACE: Is it true that your giving exemptions to two of Iran's biggest\n\ncustomers, namely India and China? And do you have a firm commitment that\n\nwithin six months they will stop all oil purchases? Because there are a lot\n\nof experts who believe that India and China are never going to stop buying\n\noil from Iran.\n\nPOMPEO: There are a lot of experts, Chris, that said President Trump's\n\npolicy wouldn't have any impact because it was just the United States and\n\nother countries weren't participating. And, in fact, we have built an\n\nenormous coalition to keep this world safe and to deny Iran money.\n\nI am very confident that the sanctions that will be re-imposed this Monday,\n\nnot only the crude oil sanctions, that the financial sanctions that are\n\nbeing put in place by the Treasury Department and over 600 designations of\n\nindividuals and companies in Iran will have the intended effect to alter\n\nthe Iranian regime's behavior. That's our expectation. It's the reason for\n\nPresident Trump's policy.\n\nWALLACE: But, specifically, sir, do you have a firm commitment from India\n\nand China that they will stop all oil purchases from Iran in six months?\n\nPOMPEO: Chris, watch what we do. Watch as we've already taken more crude\n\noil off the market than any time in previous history. Watch the efforts\n\nthat President Trump's policies have achieved. We've done all of this, too,\n\nChris, while making sure that American consumers don't suffer. We've bot\n\nBrent crude at about the same price it was back in May, when the president\n\nannounced the withdrawal from the JCPOA. That's important for American\n\nconsumers and the march to zero continues.\n\nWALLACE: You're talking about how effective these re-imposition of\n\nsanctions are. But as you well know, there are some people who are\n\ncriticizing the sanctions you're re-imposing and saying they're not tough\n\nenough. And let me put this up on the screen. Republican Senators --\n\nRepublican Senators Cruz, Cotton and Rubio plan to introduce legislation to\n\ncut off Iranian banks from the global financial network known as Swift. And\n\na group called United Against Nuclear Iran tweeted this about your\n\nsanctions. Whatever happened to maximum pressure? They caved, big time.\n\nMr. Secretary, your response?\n\nPOMPEO: Chris, the president's policy of maximum pressure will be fully in\n\nplace come tomorrow. Watch the Iranians. That's who really understands the\n\nimportance and the impact of the effort that we're undertaking. The rial\n\nhas fallen to 140,000 rial to the dollar, and has had an enormous impact\n\nalready. And we are working diligently to make sure we support the Iranian\n\npeople and that we direct our activity towards ensuring that the Islamic\n\nRepublic of Iran's maligned behavior is changed. That's the goal. That's\n\nthe mission. And that's what we will achieve on behalf of the president.\n\nWALLACE: But -- but how do you respond, for instance, to the senators were\n\nare saying, look, we should have cut them off from Swift, which is this big\n\nfinancial clearinghouse.\n\nPOMPEO: Yes, Chris -- Chris -- Chris -- Chris, the -- the Iranian banks\n\nthat engage in sanctionable behavior will be sanctioned by the Department\n\nof Treasury, period, full stop.\n\nWALLACE: I -- I understand what you're saying. On the other hand, you've\n\ngot --\n\nPOMPEO: Well, good. That's great, Chris.\n\nWALLACE: Well, if I -- if I may, sir, you've got Senator Cotton, Senator\n\nCruz, Senator Rubio, they're -- they're pretty knowledgeable on the\n\nsubject. They're not persuaded.\n\nPOMPEO: Chris, I worked with Senator Cotton. We are the two individuals\n\nthat discovered the side deals now almost three years ago to the JCPOA.\n\nThese secret side deals. I've been at this a long time. No one's going to\n\nargue that Secretary Pompeo isn't tough on Iran and no one is going to\n\nargue that President Trump isn't doing the same.\n\nWALLACE: Meanwhile, let's turn to another one of your hot spots you're\n\ndealing with.\n\nNorth Korea is now threatening to resume its nuclear buildup because they\n\nsay that the U.S. has not matched them in offering concessions, in this\n\ncase lifting economic sanctions. They say that they've made concessions and\n\nthe Trump administration has not followed suit.\n\nPOMPEO: Chris, I'll be meeting this week in New York City with my\n\ncounterpart, Kim Yong-chol. We'll have a good opportunity to continue the\n\ndenuclearization discussions that were set out just a few months back. It\n\nseems like a long time ago in news world, but it was just this past June\n\nwhen President Trump and Chairman Kim met and set us on the path that we're\n\non today.\n\nWe haven't had any missile tests. There have been no nuclear test. We've\n\nhad the returns of American remains. These are all good steps. We're\n\ncontinuing to negotiate with the North Koreans to achieve what President\n\nTrump set out, the full denuclearization verified by the United States of\n\nthe Korean peninsula, and then a brighter future for the North Korean\n\npeople.\n\nWALLACE: But -- but to follow-up specifically, how -- what's your reaction\n\nto the foreign ministry of North Korea saying -- threatening that they are\n\ngoing to resume nuclear activity? What, one, your reaction to that? And,\n\ntwo, is there any possibility that to get them to stop that, that the U.S.\n\nwill change its policy and start offering concessions on a kind of tit-for-\n\ntat basis, a phased effort by both countries?\n\nPOMPEO: Chris, I'm not worried about rhetoric. We've seen this as we go\n\nthrough negotiations. Stray voltage happens to be all around us. We're very\n\nfocused. We know with whom we're negotiating. We know what their positions\n\nare. And President Trump's made his position very clear, no economic relief\n\nuntil we have achieved our ultimate objective.\n\nWALLACE: Let's turn to Saudi Arabia. You met with Saudi Crown Prince\n\nMuhammad bin Salman about three weeks ago about the death of Jamal\n\nKhashoggi. And here's what you said after your meeting with the crown\n\nprince.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPOMPEO: He told me they were going to conduct a thorough, complete,\n\ntransparent investigation. They made a commitment too, to hold anyone\n\nconnected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that, whether\n\nthey are a senior officer or official.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: But since then, I don't have to tell you, the Saudi story has kept\n\nchanging.\n\nDo you now think that the Saudi crown prince lied both to you and to\n\nPresident Trump with what he told you back then based on all the evidence\n\nthat you have gotten sense, including the tapes that CIA Director Gina\n\nHaspel has heard? Do you now believe that this was a premeditated hit by\n\nthe Saudi royal family against Khashoggi?\n\nPOMPEO: Well, Chris, the Saudis have acknowledged that this was a\n\npremeditated attack. The facts that we're finding still are unfolding,\n\nWe're still working diligently on that. We talk with folks from Turkey,\n\nfrom Saudi Arabia nearly every day to continue those efforts.\n\nWe've begun to hold some officials accountable. We've revoked visas from 16\n\nindividuals that we have been able to identify so far that were, in fact,\n\nconnected to that. We'll continue to do that.\n\nAnd as I said, that day when I return, we will hold all of those\n\nresponsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi accountable. And we will do\n\nthat, Chris, at the same time while ensuring that the strategic\n\nrelationship between the United States and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, one\n\nthat has a great impact on the issue we just spoke about, the capacity to\n\ndeny the world's largest state sponsor of terror the ability to threaten\n\nAmerica and Israel. We will continue to work to maintain that important,\n\nstrategic relationship, while holding accountable those responsible for\n\nthis atrocious death.\n\nWALLACE: Meanwhile, you and Defense Secretary Mattis, this week, called for\n\nnegotiations and a cease-fire within 30 days between the U.S.-backed Saudi\n\nforces and the rebels that are fighting in a -- in a war inside Yemen.\n\nThere are reports that up to 16,000 Yemeni civilians have been killed in\n\nthis conflict and that around 14 million Yemenis are now on the brink, if\n\nnot already, in famine conditions.\n\nTwo questions. First of all, are you comfortable with the role that the\n\nU.S. has played in backing Saudi Arabia in this effort in Yemen? And,\n\nsecondly, if the humanitarian crisis is so urgent, why allow this to\n\ncontinue for another month, sir?\n\nPOMPEO: Chris, we -- we did make a statement this week, Secretary Mattis\n\nand I. Frankly, it's nothing new. We have been urging all the parties to\n\ncome to the table and recognize that that there's no military victory that\n\ncould be achieved in Yemen. We've asked the Iranians to do that too, Chris.\n\nMuch of the harm that's taking place there comes from the fact that the\n\nIranians continue to supply weapons and missiles to the Houthi rebels that\n\nare fighting there in Saudi Arabia. They are responsible for the starvation\n\nin Yemen as well. We want all the parties, under Martin Griffiths of the\n\nU.N. to come to the table, negotiate a solution that ends the very\n\ndifficult, tragic situation that's taking place in Yemen today.\n\nWALLACE: Secretary Pompeo, thank you. Thanks for your time.\n\nPOMPEO: Thank you, Chris.\n\nWALLACE: It's always good to talk with you, sir.\n\nPOMPEO: Thank you, sir. Have a good day.\n\nWALLACE: When we come back, where are we on making nuclear deals with Iran\n\nand North Korea? We'll ask our Sunday group when they return, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Sanctions start on Iran.\n\nThey're very serious sanctions. They're very big. They'll be elevated from\n\nthere. But, as you know, sanctions are starting on Iran and, you know, Iran\n\nis taking a very big hit.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: President Trump determined to bring Iran to its knees and to\n\nnegotiate a tougher nuclear deal than the Obama administration did in 2015.\n\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\n\nWell, Marie, you worked hard as a spokesperson for John Kerry to try to\n\nmake that deal with Iran in 2015. Now President Trump -- and let's put it\n\nup on the screen, has tweeted out this in \"Game of Thrones\" style,\n\n\"sanctions are coming.\"\n\nYour reaction to the tweet and to the policy?\n\nMARIE HARF, FOX NEWS ANALYST: Well, sanctions are a very useful tool.\n\nThey're not a joke and I -- I, obviously, don't like this sort of diplo-\n\ntainment (ph) that the president seems to engage in with many countries. I\n\ndon't like the tweet.\n\nBut setting the tweet aside, these are not the toughest sanctions ever\n\nimposed on Iran because the United Nations and the Security Council will\n\nnot re-impose sanctions -- these are only U.S. unilateral sanctions --\n\nbecause they do not like the president's rhetoric and they haven't seen\n\nthat he has a concrete plan in place to actually have negotiations to get a\n\nbetter deal. The rest of the world does not support the president. So U.S.\n\nunilateral sanctions can only do so much.\n\nAnd we heard Secretary Pompeo could not say that China and India had\n\ncommitted to reducing their oil. I think the president is very good at\n\ntearing up international agreements, whether it's Iran or Paris or the TPP,\n\nbut he has not shown yet that he can actually undertake serious\n\nnegotiations to rebuild them. And that's what the rest of the world doesn't\n\nsupport him right now.\n\nWALLACE: Brit.\n\nBRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: It isn't really quite\n\nnecessary for the rest of the world to like the policy. The rest of the\n\nworld is confronted with a choice. They can continue to do business as they\n\nhave with the United States, or they can continue to do business with Iran.\n\nFor most countries that's a very easy choice, even if you don't like it.\n\nThe United States is by far the big -- the big dog on the -- on the scene\n\nhere and if you choose not to do business with the United States and with\n\nits banking system and the rest of it, your economy is going to suffer and\n\nIran's, of course, is suffering terribly.\n\nWALLACE: But -- but some -- but some European countries are all saying\n\nsomehow they're going to be able to do both. That they're going to carve\n\nout some kind of special financial channel so that, yes, they can do\n\nbusiness with the U.S., but, yes, they can also continue because they\n\nsupport the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nHUME: They may -- they may say that. Let's see them do it. I didn't used to\n\nbelieve this, Chris. I used to think that the United States, without the\n\ninternational cooperation and a united front, could not effectively damage\n\na country's economy through sanctions. I think I was wrong about that. I\n\nthink they can and I -- and I give President Trump and his team credit for\n\nunderstanding that we are by far the big kid on the block.\n\nWALLACE: Juan, the Iran nuclear deal, I think we would all agree, even\n\nMarie and her former boss John Kerry, was far from perfect. It allowed\n\nIran, after a number of years, to resume its program. It didn't stop Iran\n\nfrom pursuing and banking terrorism around the world. But, at the same time\n\nthat we have pulled out of that agreement, as imperfect as it is, we are\n\nstruggling to get any agreement with North Korea.\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that's the big\n\npoint of contrast, Chris, is that we had a deal with Iran, as imperfect as\n\nyou describe it, but one which stopped them for developing nukes. They\n\nwere, of course, still sponsoring terrorism, as you point out, but stopped\n\nthem from developing nukes. We cannot get the same deal so far with the\n\nNorth Koreans. And I think this is a point of great concern because the\n\ncriticism of President Trump is that he has no real foreign policy\n\nexpertise, no experience, and that saber rattling, bombastic talks, \"Game\n\nof Thrones\" tweets do nothing but harden the hardliners, strengthening the\n\nhardliners inside Iran while weakening the moderate revolutionary forces\n\nthat we need to engage.\n\nWALLACE: Karl, I want you -- I'm going to give you a two-for. You can\n\nrespond to Juan. I also want you to talk about Saudi Arabia, because it is\n\nclear now that Saudi Arabia and the crown prince have clearly lied to us\n\nabout their involvement and premeditation in killing Jamal Khashoggi. The\n\npresident, though, feels that our relationship, and you could hear\n\nSecretary Pompeo say it, our relationship with the Saudis is too valuable\n\nto simply cut off. Is he right?\n\nKARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first, let me deal with Iran.\n\nLook, whether it's deliberate or not, the administration has stumbled into\n\na very good policy. The Iranian currency has lost two-thirds of its value.\n\nThere's a deep divide between European companies in the European Union,\n\nwith -- with a major company saying, we're not doing business in Iran.\n\nPart of that is because of the administration's sanctions. Part of it is\n\nbecause once they got in there, they found that it is a command-and-control\n\neconomy in which the bureaucrats are making bad decisions, where resources\n\nare being diverted to the Revolutionary Guard and where there are some\n\nstructural weaknesses in the economy that make it a very unattractive\n\nmarket.\n\nAs Brit said, they'd rather do business with us than with a stumbling third\n\nworld country that's going down, down, down, down, down. So I -- you know,\n\nI thought, frankly, exempting the major countries, there's a youthful\n\nambiguity to it. What did the administration want to do? It wanted to\n\ndamage the Iranian economy, not the world economy. It didn't want to have a\n\nspike in global energy prices that would hurt the U.S. and advantage\n\nRussia. And so they're doing it, I think, reasonably adeptly.\n\nWALLACE: OK, and how about the way we're balancing our interests in Saudi\n\nArabia?\n\nROVE: Well, look, again, I think they're -- they're -- they are in the\n\nmiddle of a very difficult situation and managing it adequately. But let's\n\nnot -- let's not be -- kid ourselves. The lead -- the new leader of Saudi\n\nArabia I think has damaged himself on the world stage. Sure, we have 16\n\npeople that they've now identified as having been involved in this\n\natrocious, horrendous murder and yet who believes that at the end of the\n\nday Mohammad bin Salam was not involved in this decision? How we -- how\n\nSaudi Arabia maintains its place on the world stage with a leader who is so\n\ndamaged and whose credibility is so undermined is beyond me.\n\nWILLIAMS: But, Karl, you say manage adequately that the United States, the\n\nTrump administration is managing this adequately?\n\nROVE: I think they are doing an excellent job on it, frankly. Look -- look\n\n--\n\nWILLIAMS: Karl, I think we have a standard -- our values. You and I\n\nobviously disagree on so much politically. We don't disagree about killing\n\npeople.\n\nWALLACE: Just -- just disagree on it very quickly, because you've got ten\n\nseconds.\n\nROVE: Well, look -- look -- the question -- I agree this -- do you blow up\n\nthe entire relationship over this or do you try and manage this so that you\n\nmaintain a relationship while --\n\nWILLIAMS: Karl, we have to stand for what we believe in as Americans.\n\nROVE: Let me finish.\n\nWALLACE: No, no.\n\nROVE: Let me finish, by standing for those values --\n\nWALLACE: You know what, let's continue this in the commercial.\n\nThank you, Panel. See you next Sunday.\n\nUp next, big names go door to door looking for votes on the trail.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: As one of the most intense midterm elections ever reaches the end\n\ngame, both sides are desperate for any advantage.

Thousands of Sri Lankans also protested in the capital in the past week demanding Sirisena immediately convene Parliament.\n\nSirisena said he made the replacement in part because Wickremesinghe and a Cabinet colleague were behind an alleged assassination plot against him. Details of the alleged plot have not been disclosed and Wickremesinghe has repeatedly denied the accusation.\n\nSirisena's moves have triggered a power struggle that some observers have called a constitutional crisis.\n\nSince his ouster, Wickremesinghe has stayed at Temple Trees, the official residence of the prime minister, insisting he is still the legitimate leader because he commands majority support in Parliament.\n\nWickremesinghe said in an interview with the AP that there is credible evidence that Rajapaksa's party is attempting to buy support in Parliament. Palitha Range Bandara, a United National Party lawmaker, has said that he was offered millions of dollars and a minister portfolio if he crossed over. Lawmakers from Rajapaksa's party have denied the allegations.\n\nTensions had been building between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe for some time, as the president did not approve of economic reforms introduced by the prime minister.\n\nSirisena was also critical of investigations into military personnel accused of human rights violations during Sri Lanka's long civil war, which ended in 2009. Rajapaksa is credited as a hero by Sri Lanka's ethnic Sinhalese majority for ending the conflict.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nPresident Donald Trump's assertion that stones thrown by Latin American protesters at American troops should be treated as \"rifles\" has sparked debate about the appropriate response to rock-throwing crowds \u2014 particularly after Nigerian troops appeared to use his comments as justification for a deadly crackdown on demonstrators over the weekend.\n\nFrom the Gaza Strip to Africa to Europe, security forces have long dealt with stone throwers, albeit in very different ways.\n\nIsrael has killed dozens of Palestinian stone-throwers over the decades, saying that rocks constituted a threat to the lives of its soldiers. In Greece, the killing of a single stone-thrower by a rogue policeman a decade ago set off weeks of riots across the country.\n\nA 1990 U.N. document, \"Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,\" is widely seen as setting the international standard for the use of force in policing environments, according to Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch.\n\nIt calls on law-enforcement agencies to show maximum restraint and to use firearms only in cases in which an \"imminent threat of death or serious injury\" is identified.\n\nThese standards have been interpreted differently around the world.\n\nLast week, Trump took aim at a migrant caravan of several thousand Central Americans making their way toward the U.S. border. Although the caravan is still some 1,200 kilometers (800 miles) from the border, Trump has mobilized troops and declared that if U.S. soldiers face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \"rifles.\" Trump later said he was merely calling for the arrests of stone throwers.\n\nBut following Trump's comments, Nigeria's military sent out a tweet that appeared to use his words as justification for shooting and killing Shiite protesters. It later removed the tweet.\n\nShakir said he fears Trump's comments could encourage other forces to loosen their rules of engagement.\n\n\"Trump's brazen, inflammatory statements, days before U.S. midterm elections, have already been seized on by rights abusers to justify more expansive open fire standards,\" he said.\n\nHere is a look at how countries around the world respond to stone throwers.\n\nIsrael/Palestinians:\n\nIsraeli forces have been confronting Palestinian stone throwers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for decades. Israeli tactics have evolved over the years, particularly with the increased use of \"non-lethal\" crowd-dispersal tools such as tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nIsraeli officials say that live fire is used only as a last resort, when soldiers' lives are threatened. But critics accuse Israel of unnecessarily, and perhaps illegally, using deadly force.\n\nIn recent months, for instance, over 160 Palestinians have been killed during mass protests along Gaza's border with Israel. Many have been unarmed.\n\nIsrael says the crowds are being incited by the Hamas militant group, and the threats go far beyond stone throwing. It says protesters are throwing grenades and firebombs and trying to infiltrate the border to attack Israeli civilians.\n\nDavid Tzur, a former commander of Israel's Border Police, a paramilitary force often used in riot-control situations, said shooting to kill is to be avoided as much as possible and that non-lethal force is sufficient in most cases. But he said troops could be justified using live fire in more chaotic situations, if a moving vehicle is pelted with stones in a tense locale, for instance.\n\nHe said he expected U.S. troops to do everything possible to avoid deadly force, since doing so escalates the situation. \"My guess is they won't be eager to start shooting,\" he said.\n\nGreece:\n\nIn Greece, firebombs and stone-throwing are routine occurrences at anarchist demonstrations held on most weekends. Police typically respond with tear gas and stun grenades to disperse the crowds.\n\nIn 2008, a rogue policeman fired his gun at a group of youths in central Athens, killing a 15-year-old protester. The death sparked two weeks of riots in major cities across Greece, and the policeman was jailed for murder.\n\nAfrican Migrants:\n\nMigrants making their way to Europe have clashed with security forces in various countries.\n\nIn Spain, migrants from Africa have on several occasions stormed across the border, pelting policemen with acid, skin irritants and other objects.\n\nBut police are not permitted to use live ammunition, and have not even used rubber bullets against migrants since a much-criticized crackdown in 2014. Spanish police did use rubber bullets last year in clashes with Catalan separatists.\n\nFrench regulations allow police officers to use force as \"legitimate defense\" against aggression. But any use of force must be proportionate, immediate and necessary.\n\nPolice do not consider \"normal\" stones to be life threatening, so live fire is normally prohibited. In \"exceptional\" cases, such as a boulder being hurled at forces, live fire could be prohibited.\n\nHungary, which takes one of the hardest lines against migrants, used only tear gas and water cannons in a major clash with migrants three years ago. One Syrian migrant, however, was sentenced to five years in prison on terrorism charges for entering the country illegally and throwing stones at police.\n\nKashmir:\n\nIn Indian-administered Kashmir, a disputed territory divided between India and Pakistan, protesters have long viewed stone throwing as a legitimate form of protest against Indian rule.\n\nIndia has often responded with tough measures, including live fire and metal pellets that have killed, maimed or blinded hundreds of people over the last decade. India says its troops are in life-threatening situations that justify the heavy use of force.\n\nProtesters caught stone throwing at soldiers and police \u2014 often identified through video recordings of demonstrations \u2014 are usually accused of attempting to murder government functionaries, a charge that invokes long imprisonment if convicted. Many stone throwers have been shot dead by soldiers.\n\nRebels have been fighting Indian control since 1989. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian military crackdown.\n\n___\n\nAijaz Hussain in Srinigar, India; Elena Becatoros in Athens; Thomas Adamson in Paris; Pablo Gorondi in Budapest, Hungary; Joseph Wilson in Barcelona, Spain, and Aron Heller in Jerusalem contributed reporting.", "Fighting has escalated around Yemen's key port city of Hodeida, with more than 150 combatants killed over the weekend from both the rebel and government-backed sides, officials said Sunday.\n\nAirstrikes and naval artillery pounded rebel positions around the Red Sea costal city, where government backed-troops are launching a major ground assault in an attempt to wrest it from dug-in rebels. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nFierce fighting also erupted in the provinces of Bayda, to the south, and Saada, a Houthi stronghold in the north, they added.\n\nYemen has been at war since March 2015 when the rebels, known as Houthis, occupied northern regions and forced the government into exile. Since then, a Saudi-led, U.S.-backed coalition supporting the largely exiled government has blockaded the rebel-held north and waged a devastating air campaign, causing thousands of deaths. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars' worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition, while the coalition, which backs the exiled government, accuses the Houthis of acting as Iran's proxy.\n\nThe war has led to a humanitarian crisis that is one of the worst in the world, with three quarters of Yemen's population requiring some form of life-saving assistance and protection, according to the United Nations Population Fund. An estimated 10,000 people have been killed and more than 8 million are at risk of starvation from a looming famine, including 2 million mothers who are risking death.\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund regional director said over the weekend that Yemeni authorities \u2014 both from the pro-government and rebel side \u2014 are making it \"impossible\" to deliver and distribute much-needed humanitarian aid to the country.\n\nOn Sunday, Geert Cappelaere called the situation a \"living hell\" for all Yemeni children, noting the death of a child whose emaciated body gained attention on the front page of the New York Times last week.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Amal is not the only Yemeni child suffering that fate,\" he said in a speech delivered in Amman. \"30,000 children in Yemen die every single year of malnutrition as one of the most important underlying causes.

With crippling sanctions on Iran's vital oil industry set to take effect Monday, Iran's already-damaged economy likely will suffer more, though politicians and protesters struck a defiant tone.\n\n\"Today the Iranian nation will show that Mr. Trump is too small to be able to bring Iran to its knees,\" said Ali Larijani, Iran's parliament speaker.\n\nCHINA RAPIDLY EXPANDING INTERNMENT CAMPS FOR MUSLIMS, REPORT SAYS\n\nThe annual commemoration marks when student demonstrators climbed over the fence at the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, angered about Carter allowing the fatally ill Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to receive cancer treatment in the United States. The students soon took over the entire, leafy compound. A few staffers fled and hid in the home of the Canadian ambassador to Iran before escaping the country with the help of the CIA, a story recounted in the 2012 film \"Argo.\"\n\nWhile the commemoration annually sees American flags burned and cries of \"Death to America\" rise up, it also has a carnival-like atmosphere for the students and others taking part. Some waved massive inflatable ballistic missiles. Others held signs lampooning Trump, including images of him contorted into a Nazi swastika or as a missile chasing after a dove.\n\nGen.

Its rial currency now trades at 145,000 to one U.S. dollar, down from when it traded 40,500 to $1 a year ago. The economic chaos sparked mass anti-government protests at the end of last year which resulted in nearly 5,000 reported arrests and at least 25 people being killed. Sporadic demonstrations still continue.\n\nThe U.S. has said the sanctions are not aimed at toppling Iran's government, but at changing its policies, including its support for militant groups and development of long-range missiles.\n\nAnother demonstrator Sunday, Jamshid Zarei, waved a banner in English quoting Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying: \"America can't do a damn thing.\"\n\n\"The Iranian people are feeling the economic pressure at their dinner tables and we complain about this, but it will not make Iranian people give up Islam, their values and the (Islamic) Revolution because of rising prices,\" he said, according to the Associated Press. \"Anyone who thinks that way is really a fool.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday defended the White House\u2019s move last week to reimpose sanctions against Iran amid criticism from some conservatives that the action does not go far enough to cripple the country\u2019s economy.\n\n\"The sanctions that will be reimposed tomorrow are the toughest sanctions ever put in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" Pompeo said during an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday.\" \"They're aimed at a single purpose -- denying the world's largest state sponsor of terror the capacity to do things like the things they've done in the past few weeks.\"\n\nWhile Trump removed the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal earlier this year and sanctions are set to be imposed Monday, some critics are upset that some countries received waivers from the sanctions to continue importing Iranian oil.\n\nPompeo would not identify the countries receiving waivers, but maintained that despite the waivers, \"these sanctions have already had an enormous impact.\" He added that there are eight unidentified nations that \"need a little bit more time to get to zero,\" but \u201cthe march to zero continues.\u201d\n\nThe waivers will be valid for six months, during which time the importing country can buy Iranian oil but must deposit Iran's revenue in an escrow account. Iran can spend the money but only on a narrow range of humanitarian items.\n\nThe sanctions take effect Monday and cover Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors. They are the second batch the administration has re-imposed since Trump withdrew from the landmark accord in May.\n\nThe 2015 deal, one of former President Barack Obama's biggest diplomatic achievements, gave Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, which many believed it was using to develop atomic weapons. Trump repeatedly denounced the agreement as the \"worst ever\" negotiated by the United States and said it gave Iran too much in return for too little.\n\nBut proponents as well as the other parties to the deal \u2014 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union \u2014 have vehemently defended it. The Europeans have mounted a drive to save the agreement without the U.S., fearing that the new sanctions will drive Iran to pull out and resume all of its nuclear work.\n\nIn a statement issued Friday night, Trump said, \"Our objective is to force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster.\"\n\nSome Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere said Friday's move should have gone even further. They were hoping for Iran to be disconnected from the main international financial messaging network known as SWIFT.\n\nWith limited exceptions, the re-imposed U.S. sanctions will hit Iran as well as countries that do not stop importing Iranian oil and foreign firms that do business with blacklisted Iranian entities, including its central bank, a number of private financial institutions, and state-run port and shipping firms, as well as hundreds of individual Iranian officials.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin defended the decision to allow some Iranian banks to remain connected to SWIFT, saying that the Belgium-based firm had been warned that it will face penalties if sanctioned institutions are permitted to use it. And, he said that U.S. regulators would be watching closely Iranian transactions that use SWIFT to ensure any of those that run afoul of U.S. sanctions would be punished.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nThe husband of a Christian woman acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy, but not released after countrywide protests, appealed on Sunday to U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May to help the family leave Pakistan.\n\nAsia Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, in a brief video message said they were in danger in Pakistan.\n\n\"Please help us, we are in trouble in Pakistan,\" Masih appealed to Trump and May.

A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam's prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction. Bibi's family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet.\n\nInsulting Islam is punishable by death in Pakistan, and the mere rumor of doing so can incite lynchings.\n\nPakistan's top court acquitted Bibi on Wednesday of the charges carrying the death penalty, infuriating hard-line Islamists who held three days of nationwide protests demanding her execution. The enraged protesters torched scores of vehicles, blocked highways and attacked government and public property; a radical cleric also threatened to kill the three judges who acquitted Bibi. The protests ended after the government agreed to impose a travel ban on Bibi and allow her case to be reviewed. A review petition was filed in the Supreme Court.\n\nEarlier in the day, police said over 150 people were arrested on charges of arson, vandalism and violence during the protests.\n\nSenior police officer Nayab Haider said that police were using video clips to identify those involved in assaults, torching property and vehicles, and blocking highways.\n\nDefending the police's actions, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the government cannot spare those involved in violence.

That's when he wasn't busy escaping from jail \u2014 twice.\n\nThe almost-mythical criminal pedigree of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who was extradited in 2017 to face U.S. drug conspiracy charges, has sparked security concerns at his upcoming New York City trial that at times have drawn as much attention as the case's sensational allegations.\n\nA look at those concerns for a trial that is starting Monday with jury selection. Opening statements are likely Nov. 13.\n\n___\n\nWITNESSES IN THE CROSSHAIRS\n\nProsecutors say Guzman was in the habit of ordering the killings of anyone who got in his way during his heyday in Mexico as boss of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nIn his way now is a lineup of government witnesses who survived the wave of violence and are expected to give details about the ruthless way he kept power for 20 years in the cutthroat world of international drug trafficking. The defense says the witnesses are the true bad guys whose testimony shouldn't be trusted.\n\nThe names of the witnesses have been blacked out on court documents with prosecutors saying their identities need to be protected because their cooperation could put them in the crosshairs of a vengeful cartel. According to court papers, some are being held in special jail units for their protection, while others are in witness protection programs.\n\nThe list of people who could turn up on the witness stand is long. Two standout possibilities are twin brothers Pedro and Margarito Flores, former Chicago-based narcotics wholesalers who did business with Guzman before their arrest in 2008. They agreed to cooperate and record phone conversations with Guzman about the size of shipments smuggled on boats and airplanes.\n\nIn one, a voice identified as Guzman's asks, \"How much can you get rid of in a month?\"\n\nThe now imprisoned brothers paid a steep price for flipping: Prosecutors say in 2009 their father was murdered in Mexico by a cartel hit team.\n\n___\n\nFORTIFYING THE COURTHOUSE\n\nAt pretrial hearings leading to the trial, heavily armed federal officers and bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled outside. Anyone trying to attend the hearings was put through airport-style metal detectors at the courthouse entrance and at the door of the courtroom itself.\n\nThe judge also agreed with prosecutors that the jury for the case should be kept anonymous, a measure typical in terrorism or mob cases where jury intimidation is a concern.\n\nNo one's hiding the ominous nature of the case from potential jurors. Questions for them on an initial screening form ask if they've ever heard of \"El Chapo\" along with, \"Have you, or has anyone close to you, ever felt fearful of or threatened by people who you thought were associated with drug crimes?\"\n\nJurors also will be escorted to and from the courthouse by federal officers and sequestered from the public while inside. As a reason, the judge cited prosecutors' contention that Guzman's cartel \"employs 'sicarios,' or hit men, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults and kidnappings.\"\n\n___\n\nKEEPING AN EYE ON EL CHAPO\n\nAfter Guzman was brought to New York, authorities here decided he should be housed in solitary confinement in a high-security wing of a federal jail in Manhattan that has held notorious terrorists and mobsters.\n\nCentral to that calculation was Guzman's history of giving directions to his lieutenants from Mexican jails and credentials as a two-time escapee there. The second time was via a mile-long (1.6 kilometer-long) tunnel dug to the shower in his cell.\n\nThe logistical problem for his keepers: The case is being prosecuted across the East River in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nFor pre-trial hearings, authorities opted to transport him to and from jail by shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge to make way for a police motorcade that included a SWAT team and an ambulance, all tracked by helicopters.\n\nThe judge indicated he thinks the time and expense involved would add up to a logistical nightmare \u2014 and an inconvenience for New Yorkers who rely on the bridge to commute \u2014 for a trial expected to last as long as four months. He said there would be adjustments, but didn't elaborate.\n\nThere's now speculation that a special cell for Guzman has been set up in the bowels of the courthouse where he will spend the night after his days in court.\n\nBut no one is saying.

Conversely, the same group of likely voters surveyed by St. Pete Polls preferred Democrat Andrew Gillum to Republican Ron DeSantis in the state's gubernatorial contest to replace the term-limited Scott, 48.4 percent to 43.6 percent, with 3.7 percent undecided. Every other major recent poll tracked by RealClearPolitics (RCP) also shows DeSantis trailing by small margins.\n\nThe split figures encapsulated the problem facing the GOP in the House and several governor's mansions across the country with just two days until the Nov. 6 elections: Given that so many races in Republican-leaning areas are effectively toss-ups, an unusually high number would have to break right at the last minute for the GOP to have a good day on Tuesday.\n\nThe most recent Fox News Power Rankings show 5 toss-up Senate races, 29 toss-up House races, and 8 toss-up gubernatorial races.

The poll, conducted by the Republican-leaning Trafalgar Group, commenced on Oct. 30 and ended Nov. 1 -- the same day the Green Party candidate in the race dropped out and backed Sinema, in what could be a massive boon to Sinema's chances.\n\nMcSally has argued that Sinema, who openly derided Arizona and stay-at-home mothers in newly unearthed videos from her days as a progressive firebrand, should apologize for once expressing apparent disinterest about the phenomenon of Americans who join the Taliban.\n\nDespite the flurry of seemingly negative polls, there were some early signs that Republican enthusiasm and momentum has rebounded.

A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday gives Democratic businessman Fred Hubbell a 2-point edge over Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, well within the margin of error.

We wonder whether it\u2019s our browser, our device, or the website we\u2019re visiting.\n\nYou may suspect your Wi-Fi signal. Wireless networks are notorious for connection problems. Tap or click here for a way to diagnose and fix troublesome Wi-Fi.\n\nHow can you pinpoint the issue? Your first step is to check your connection speed. Afterward, compare the results of the test to the speed advertised by your internet provider.\n\nNote: Make sure no one in your home network is doing bandwidth-hogging tasks like file downloads, file sharing, video streaming, video chats, etc. You don\u2019t want any activity within your control to be skewing results.\n\nMeasuring internet speed\n\nInternet speed typically is measured in \u201cmegabytes per second,\u201d or Mbps. t know what this number means, or even that this measurement exists. Every provider promises different tiers of internet speed rates; usually the pricier the plan, the faster your internet should be.\n\n1 - 3 Mbps - Good enough for web surfing, email, social, casual online gaming (if you don\u2019t mind some latency) and email. However, this is not ideal for video streaming.\n\n3-4 Mbps - This is the minimum speed for standard video streaming from services like Netflix. This speed may be enough for a one-computer household, but with all the HD content that\u2019s available on the web right now, this will lead to constant video buffering.\n\n5-10 Mbps - Netflix recommends at least 5 Mbps for a single HD stream, and you\u2019ll double that for two simultaneous HD streams. Although this is the baseline speed that is required for HD content, it could still lead to buffering especially if you have multiple connected gadgets at home.\n\n10 - 20 Mbps - This is the minimum speed for a consistent and reliable internet experience. If you continuously download files from the web and cloud storage services, get a plan with this advertised speed at the very least.\n\n20 Mbps and higher - Now we\u2019re talking. Households with multiple computers and gadgets, video streaming services, smart appliances, and simultaneous users should aim for at least a 20 Mbps plan.\n\nServices that test internet speed\n\nNow that you have an idea what internet speed is required for certain activities, test your actual bandwidth and compare it to your provider\u2019s advertised speed. Here is a list of the most popular sites to use. It\u2019s a good idea to conduct the test at more than one site. Your mileage may vary.\n\nOokla Speedtest\n\nOne of the most well-known internet speed test services available is Ookla Speedtest. This service can measure your connection\u2019s ping response, download and upload speeds from a remote server.\n\nAs for download and upload speeds, measurements are given in bits per second. Higher numbers are better. Download speeds will typically be much faster than upload speeds.\n\nYou can also compare these numbers against the speeds that your internet service provider promises you. Be sure to run multiple tests over several days at different times. This will give you an overall picture of your connection speed. You also might find specific periods when it\u2019s slow, depending on your area\u2019s network congestion.\n\nTap or click here to try Ookla Speedtest now.\n\nFast.com\n\nInterestingly, Netflix has its internet speed test called Fast.com.\n\nFast.com is entirely browser-based, so you don\u2019t have to download an app or program. Just point your web-based or mobile browser to Fast.com and the test will automatically run and show your download speed when it\u2019s done.\n\nFor more details about your connection, tap or click the \u201cShow more info\u201d box. This will show your latency, upload speeds and the servers used for the test.\n\nSpeedOf.Me\n\nAnother excellent web-based speed test is SpeedOf.Me. What\u2019s great about this tool is the real-time graph that tracks the fluctuations in the speeds while the test is running. It can also provide you with a graphical history of all the tests you\u2019ve run for comparison. Click here to try SpeedOf.Me now.\n\nOther tests you can try\n\nOther alternative speed tests can be accessed straight on the search engine of your choice. For example, search for the keywords \u201cspeed test\u201d on Google and the first hit will show Google\u2019s very own speed test tool.\n\nThe same service is available from Bing. Just search for \u201cspeed test\u201d via Bing and the first result is a handy speedometer-style internet speed tool that measures ping response plus download and upload speeds.\n\nTips for more accurate results\n\nWhenever available, always use a wired connection for more accurate and consistent results. Why? The culprit of your slower speeds may lie on your Wi-Fi connection and not on your ISP connection itself.\n\nDo multiple tests and if the average of the results is only about 5-10 Mbps off, then that should be tolerable. Factors like congestion during peak times and your distance from the relay hardware will contribute to slight variations on your speed. (For more accuracy, you could turn your Wi-Fi radios off during the wired tests.)\n\nIf your wired results are way lower than advertised, a consistent 20 to 30 Mbps difference, perhaps, then there might be something else going on.\n\nCheck your hardware first and see if it\u2019s compatible with your provider\u2019s recommendations. For example, older DOCSIS 2.0 modems can\u2019t go beyond 38 Mbps. If you have a rate plan of 50 Mbps and above, better upgrade your modem to DOCSIS 3.0.\n\nWhat if you already have newer hardware and you\u2019re still seeing less-than-advertised speeds? Then check your network for unauthorized devices that may be stealing your bandwidth.\n\nIf you do find Wi-Fi thieves, better kick them off then change your network password quick!

After a chance meeting, he got a job that year as an intern for Christine Quinn, a former speaker of New York City\u2019s city council who was also a former mayoral candidate.\n\nOn Friday, Polite was arrested and charged with criminal mischief as a hate crime in connection with vandalism Thursday at the Union Temple in Brooklyn that forced the cancelation of a political event.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio visited the temple Friday night and called the incident \u201ctremendously upsetting,\u201d according to the New York Daily News.\n\nVANDALISM AT NEW YORK CITY SYNAGOGUE LEADS TO ARREST\n\nOn Saturday, Quinn confirmed that the vandalism suspect was the same individual who had worked for her.\n\n\u201cI know this young man,\u201d Quinn wrote, \u201cand along with many others in the New York City Council and social services agencies throughout the City, have done everything I could over the years to help him as he grew up in and out of the foster system, in and out of the mental health system, and in and out of homelessness.

State radio said nine of those victims were in a home that was flooded by a rapidly swelling river in the countryside near Palermo.\n\nThe radio report said one man survived the house flood late Saturday night by clinging to a tree. The survivor used his cellphone to call for help but it was too late for the others, including a one-year-old baby and a three-year-old child. The victims were from two families who had gathered in the country villa for the weekend.\n\nAnother confirmed fatality was a man whose body was found on a guardrail along a Palermo-area road after floodwaters swept away his car, Italian news reports said.\n\nState TV also said two people were killed by the storm in the outskirts of Agrigento, a Sicilian tourist town famed for its ancient Greek temples. If confirmed, those deaths would raise the overall death toll in Sicily to 12.\n\nAt least two persons were missing Sunday in other incidents in Sicily after floodwaters swept away their cars, including that of a doctor heading to the hospital of the hill town of Corleone.\n\nStorms had battered northern Italy earlier in the week, killing at least 15 people, uprooting millions of trees near Alpine valleys and leaving several Italian villages without electricity or road access for days.\n\nIn Casteldaccia, the hamlet where the river flooded the home in Sicily, neighbor Maria Concetta Alfano said she, her husband and their adult disabled daughter fled after barking dogs drew their attention to the rising waters in the Milicia River, the Italian news agency ANSA said.

Human rights groups and activists say the charges against him are politically-motivated and related to his work as a leading opposition figure.\n\nThe verdict was issued just weeks before parliamentary elections are set to take place without the Al-Wefaq political group Salman once led. Al-Wefaq, which was the tiny Gulf nation's largest Shiite opposition bloc, was ordered dissolved in 2016 as part of a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom, which has a Shiite majority but is ruled by a Sunni monarchy.\n\nThe state-run Bahrain News Agency reported the appellate court's decision Sunday without naming the defendants, saying three individuals were found guilty of the spying charges.\n\nHuman Rights First, an activist group, confirmed the ruling refers to Salman. His co-defendants in the case\u2014 Sheikh Hassan Ali Juma Sultan and Ali Mahdi Ali al-Aswad\u2014 are also former al-Wefaq officials.\n\nThe three faced charges of disclosing sensitive information to Qatar that could harm Bahrain's security in exchange for financial compensation. The state-run news agency said prosecutors presented recorded phone conversations as evidence.\n\nLast year, Bahrain state television aired the recorded calls between Salman and Qatar's then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani during the 2011 protests.\n\nBahrain is one of four Arab countries that have been boycotting Qatar for over a year as part of a wider diplomatic dispute.\n\nA government-sponsored report on the 2011 protests and unrest noted Bahrain's opposition had accepted an idea for mediation by Qatar during the uprising, but Bahrain's government had rejected it. Salman's supporters say calls to Qatar were related to those efforts and that recordings were edited to suggest otherwise.\n\nBahrain is home to the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet. The 2011 uprising there was quelled with help from Saudi and Emirati forces.\n\nSalman, in his early 50s, has long been targeted by Bahrain's government. In 1994, he was arrested, allegedly tortured and detained for months without trial before being deported and forced to live in exile for over 15 years, according to the United Nations.\n\nHe is currently serving out a four-year sentence in another trial on charges he insulted the Interior Ministry, which oversees police, incited others to break the law and incited hatred against naturalized Sunni citizens, many of whom serve in Bahrain's security forces.\n\nBrian Dooley, a senior advisor at Human Rights First, said Sunday's ruling \"confirms there is now no tolerance for any dissent in Bahrain.\"\n\nAmnesty International described the verdict as a \"travesty of justice\" and said Salman is being held \"solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression.\"", "Mr. \u201cMargaritaville\u201d Jimmy Buffett shared a stage with Florida Democrats on Saturday, taking shots at President Trump and Republicans in the process.\n\n\"Andrew Gillum's going to win,\" Buffett told a crowd of onlookers at West Palm Beach, referring to the Democratic Tallahassee mayor who's running for governor of the state against GOP challenger Ron DeSantis, a former congressman.\n\nThen Buffett altered the lyrics to one of his songs, \"Come Monday,\" to reference Tuesday\u2019s election: \"Come Tuesday, things will change. Come Tuesday, we\u2019re making a change. It\u2019s been two insane years and it\u2019s time to really switch gears. It's been two insane years and it's time to switch gears.\"\n\nLater, Buffett changed some words to his biggest hit, \"Margaritaville,\" to poke fun at Rick Scott, Florida's Republican governor, who is now seeking a U.S. Senate seat: \"Some people say there's a red tide to blame,\" Buffett sang, \"but I know, that it's all Rick Scott's fault.\"\n\nAppearing with Buffett, Gillum urged voters to reject the politics of Trump and the GOP, saying, \"We're being convinced we've got to step on our neighbor's shoulder and on their backs ... in order for us to get ahead,\" the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\nJoining Gillum was his running mate Chris King and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat who is locked in a race against Scott.\n\nBuffett, 71, spoke briefly before launching into song: \"These are your guys, this is your ticket,\" he said. \"There are better days ahead. Now let's have some fun.\"\n\nGillum pledged to rein in the National Rifle Association, a day after a gunman killed two women at a yoga studio in Tallahassee.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" Gillum said. \"We can celebrate what it means to have the Second Amendment and celebrate safety and security in our homes, in our neighborhoods, in our schools, in our houses of worship at the same time.\"\n\nBuffett, known for his island escape-ism sounds, draws an older, whiter crowd, the paper said. His fans, known as Parrot Heads, showered Gillum with support, with some wearing \u201cAndrew Gillum for Governor\u201d T-shirts among the sea of Hawaiian shirts in the crowd.\n\n\"We need Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson to win, we need to retake America,\" said Jane Lipson, 67, a retired teacher who wore a \"Jimmy Buffett for President\" T-shirt and drove up from neighboring Broward County to attend the rally. \"The bigotry, the hatred.

So far U.S. authorities haven't announced any huge hacks or the kind of multipronged campaign suspected in the 2016 election, and it's hard to judge whether the more recent Russian actions have any link to the Kremlin or will have any electoral impact.\n\nBut why do they appear to be at it again? Dozens of Russians suspected of meddling in 2016 have been hit with U.S. charges or sanctions, including well-placed magnates. Moscow's ties with the West have deteriorated badly amid ever-more-shocking allegations of Russian interference abroad.\n\nAnd some argue that Russian meddlers don't need to mess with the U.S. midterms this year because they got what they wanted in 2016: Donald Trump in the White House and mass disillusionment with the democratic process.\n\nThe Kremlin likes Trump because he's one of the rare Western leaders to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, but its hoped-for Russian-American rapprochement hasn't really materialized. A Democratic House or Senate after Tuesday's U.S. election would make that an even more distant prospect.\n\n\"Russians have a preference and they will do what they can to swing (the result) in their favor, especially if margins are tight,\" said James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.\n\nHe cautions, however, that \"Russia is not responsible for all of America's problems. America has splits and fissures like all of us, and Russia puts in a lever and pries them open.\"\n\nSome Russians, meanwhile, wear the U.S. accusations as a badge of honor, a sign that their country is a fearsome world power again.\n\nThe first person charged with foreign interference in the 2018 midterms, Elena Khusyaynova, said \"my heart filled with pride\" at the news. Speaking last week on Russian TV after being indicted in the United States for a covert social media campaign for both the 2016 and 2018 votes, she added, \"It turns out that a simple Russian woman could help citizens of a superpower elect their president.\"\n\nPavel Koshkin of Moscow's USA and Canada Institute called accusations of meddling \"a gift to Russian propaganda and Russian politicians,\" who can use U.S. anti-Russian sentiment \"as a tool in stirring anti-Americanism and increasing their approval ratings.\"\n\nThe 2016 U.S. election thrust Russian foreign interference into the spotlight, but it wasn't an isolated project. It fit into a yearslong effort by Putin's Kremlin to take revenge over what's seen as the U.S.-led humiliation of post-Soviet Russia, through crippling loan programs and NATO's post-Cold War expansion.\n\nThe Kremlin also resents what it considers U.S. interference in the politics of countries once under Moscow's sphere of influence, from Ukraine to the Caucasus. To many Russians, what's happening now in the U.S. is just payback.\n\nThe resulting U.S. sanctions have damaged the Russian economy, but if the goal was changing Russian foreign policy, \"this goal certainly hasn't been achieved,\" said analyst Masha Lipman. \"In fact, the opposite is true. The more pressure (on Russia), the lower the desire or willingness to concede.\"\n\nAs special counsel Robert Mueller has investigated possible Russian collusion with Trump's 2016 campaign, Moscow has increased efforts to make its mark elsewhere \u2014 in Syria, Libya, and in political debates across Europe.\n\nSo far in 2018, Russian agents have been accused of a nerve agent attack in Britain, trying to hack the world's chemical weapons watchdog in the Netherlands, and seeking to derail a referendum in Macedonia to stop the country from joining NATO and the European Union.\n\nEven after Mueller's team in February indicted a dozen Russians linked to the Internet Research Agency, the so-called troll farm in St. Petersburg, its sponsors openly continued to target U.S. audiences.\n\nOne of its projects, a news site called USAReally, covers tight U.S. congressional races and is closely following the migrant caravan heading north from Latin America.\n\n\"Yes, we are a Russian site. We talk to Americans about America. But is that forbidden?\" its chief editor Alexander Malkevich, an avowed Trump fan, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"Influence readers? Every media wants to do that. ... and so what?\"\n\nHe acknowledged that Russian-American relations are unlikely to improve quickly no matter the outcome Tuesday \u2014 and expressed interest in the 2020 U.S. presidential race.\n\nMalkevich also assails what he calls the myth of American democracy. That's one more way that alleged Russian manipulation of U.S. social media serves the Kremlin's interests: By discrediting Western democracy, that strengthens Putin's argument to his own voters that his authoritarian model of governance is best.\n\n\"The growing confrontation with the West and a focus on it on national television channels probably helped consolidate this effect of a fortress under siege,\" one of Putin's metaphors for modern Russia, Lipman said. \"And pledging allegiance to the leader is a matter not only of loyalty but even of national security and national identity. \"\n\nMany of the Russians accused of interference in the 2016 U.S. campaign have moved underground or moved on. Some shut down their social media presence. Some have changed jobs.\n\nOne of the indicted troll factory workers, Sergei Polozov, announced on the Russian social network VKontakte that he was \"using his notoriety for a good cause\" and had persuaded Russian censors to block four Ukrainian news sites. He vowed to continue fighting those who \"try to drag Russia through the mud\" and thanked \"those who want to join me in the fight against informational enemies.\"\n\nThe troll factory, meanwhile, has moved to bigger offices in St. Petersburg, just 2.5 kilometers (a mile and a half) across town.\n\n___\n\nIuliia Subbotovska in Moscow contributed.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nIndonesian authorities have extended the search at sea for victims of the Lion Air crash and the plane's cockpit voice recorder.\n\nNational Search and Rescue Agency chief Muhammad Syaugi said Sunday that the operation, now in its 7th day and involving hundreds of personnel and dozens of ships, would continue for another three days.\n\nSyaugi paid tribute to a volunteer diver, Syahrul Anto, who died during the search effort on Friday.

In the process, we\u2019ve let our language become weaponized.\n\nPresident Lincoln\u2019s First Inaugural Address, delivered to a nation more divided than our own, is timeless tonic for troubled times. Recall his close:\n\n\u201cWe are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\u201d\n\nIt would be great to hear soaring rhetoric like that again from our national leaders, but here\u2019s what I\u2019ve figured out: It will not do to wait around for it. We everyday citizens must reclaim our language. We can choose words and phrases in our daily interactions that speak not to our outward differences, but our common humanity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say we must remain silent until we have words worthy of Lincoln. I simply mean going into November we must remember - as Lincoln did when it was eminently harder to do so - that far more unites us Americans than divides us.\n\nBut how shall we do this? What do I in Charlotte, North Carolina have in common with someone in Berkeley, California? Simple, a love of laughter. The world can never have enough laughter, and not the mean-spirited kind. The kind that brings A and B closer together, but not at C\u2019s expense. Who doesn\u2019t want more of those laughs? They\u2019re as natural as sneezing, and less messy.\n\nWith this mirthful goal in mind \u2013 a redeployment of language to joyous ends - consider the simile. What literary technique can hold a candle to this wonderful device? Onomatopoeia? Pshaw. How often do you really use that? Anagrams? They\u2019re useful for Dan Brown novels, but little else. Alliteration? More decadent than deft.\n\nNo, it\u2019s the simile that is primus inter pares. Properly employed, similes turn complex ideas into simple visuals, words into imagery. Improperly employed, they still lead to hours of blithe conversation. Bildungsroman? We probably spent too much time on that in school, but similes? Worth every joyful minute.\n\nI\u2019ll let others praise the abrupt metaphor, that linguistic bull in a china shop. As a midwife assists in childbirth, so a simile gracefully begets artful phrasing. Why, similes so beguile me that they spill out of my pockets, like so many red poppies. I share some here, hopeful that even stripped of context, they bring you joy.\n\nLike a man staring into an empty bowling bag moments before league play, Jed knew he was in for a rough evening.\n\nKnowledge came to Stewart as slowly as dressing does to a man who puts on his shoes before his pants.\n\nDetective McArthur studied the crime scene but, like a \u201cCoexist\u201d bumper sticker on a Ford F-150, something didn\u2019t add up.\n\nGilley knew the investment had upside. But like a man with a taser at a live auction, the downside wasn\u2019t hard to contemplate, either.\n\nReflecting on his colleague\u2019s brief, structured but essentially meaningless after-dinner remarks, Dr. Paisley felt as shortchanged as when he\u2019d read his first haiku.\n\nMichael persisted in his courtship of lovely Devin, but she knew that like an NPR pledge drive, eventually it would end with him getting absolutely nothing from her.\n\nLike a tall man taking off a tank top under a ceiling fan, Doug was equal parts startled and disoriented.\n\nTom gazed at enchanting Andrea and knew, as surely as a train commuter clutching bubble wrap in the quiet car, that sooner or later he\u2019d give in to temptation.\n\nEric approached the software bug in a different though not necessarily better way, as a man who gives distances in directions \u201cas a crow walks\u201d.\n\nRos closed the front door of his childhood home and just knew, like a tourist crossing over tire-spikes at a rental car return, that there was no going back.\n\nEyeing the competition, Hugh\u2019s confidence dropped as suddenly as a man\u2019s with headphones on a crowded elevator, the moment he realizes he\u2019s singing Toto\u2019s \u201cAfrica\u201d too loud.\n\nGeri\u2019s words stung but Greg held his tongue, sure that responding, like breaking out jazz hands in a bar fight, would only escalate things.\n\nDid these similes inspire you, like Lincoln\u2019s First Inaugural? No, probably not. But did they make you smile, or better yet, remind you of the healing power of language? Like an unprepared middle-schooler counting on a snow day, I hope so.", "Seasonal outbreaks of the flu cause thousands of deaths even in a good year, and the last flu season, 2017-2018, was a terrible one. It killed 80,000 Americans and sent 900,000 to the hospital, making it the worst influenza season in decades.\n\nData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), show how much of an outlier it was: Previously, seasonal outbreaks since 2010, had killed between 12,000 and 56,000 and caused between 140,000 and 710,000 hospitalizations.\n\nStatistics like that can seem impersonal, but this one isn\u2019t: \u201cOne hundred and eighty families put a child in a grave last year because of a vaccine-preventable infection,\u201d according to Wendy Sue Swanson, a pediatrician at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. Eighty percent of them had not had a flu shot.\n\nVaccination is the key to prevention. According to estimates from the CDC, in six flu seasons starting in 2005-06, flu vaccination against a variety of strains prevented almost 14 million cases.\n\nThat might seem impressive, but our current vaccination rates are unacceptably low \u2013 in large part because of the proselytizing of anti-vaccine activists \u2013 and in some years the available vaccines are barely adequate. Vaccine exemption rates \u2013 most often for \u201cphilosophical objections\u201d to vaccination \u2013 among infants and school-aged children have been rising, creating pockets of unimmunized, vulnerable individuals, according to just-published data from the CDC.\n\nThis is inexcusable. \u201cNot only does it put at risk those who choose to forego vaccination, but also people who cannot be vaccinated because they\u2019re younger than six months or have medical contraindications, such as an impaired immune system,\u201d according to pediatric allergist Dr. Michael H. Mellon.\n\nToo many vaccinated people still get the flu, and when it comes to research funding to address this problem, our public health agencies seem little exercised about it.\n\nWe know a lot about the flu virus and humans\u2019 immune responses to it. The surface of flu viruses is studded with proteins called hemagglutinins, which are the part of the virus that binds to cells in a person\u2019s respiratory tract, initiating infection. Hemagglutinins are shaped a bit like a lollypop \u2013 they have a globe-like head attached to a stalk.\n\nWhen the immune system is exposed to a flu hemagglutinin protein \u2013 either on a virus or in a vaccine \u2013 it produces antibodies to the protein. Most of those antibodies target the head of the protein, which is the part that mutates continuously and, thereby, evades the immune system\u2019s defenses.\n\nConversely, the stalk doesn\u2019t undergo as much change and is quite similar from strain to strain. Antibodies that recognize and neutralize the hemagglutinin stalk should, in theory, work against multiple strains of flu. However, the stalk doesn\u2019t elicit a strong immune response, and researchers have not yet found a way to enhance it.\n\nBecause flu viruses mutate frequently, vaccines are reformulated early in the year as a mixture of virus strains predicted to prevail during the next fall and winter. Depending on how good the selections of strains are, during a given flu season the effectiveness can vary widely.\n\nSince the 2004-05 season, vaccines\u2019 effectiveness has varied from 10 to 60 percent. Last season, the vaccine was a poor match for circulating viruses, and was around 40 percent effective overall, but lower in the elderly. In part, that was because most illnesses were caused by a virulent strain called H3N2, against which flu vaccines typically aren\u2019t very effective.\n\nOne of the reasons for flu vaccines\u2019 relative ineffectiveness last season was that most were prepared from fertilized chicken eggs, a method of production known to reduce the effectiveness against certain flu strains, particularly H3N2. Manufacturers should stop using chicken eggs and instead prepare vaccines by growing virus in \u201ccultured cells\u201d \u2013 cells that have been removed from animals and are grown under controlled conditions.\n\nThat method would produce vaccines with greater fidelity to the targeted flu strains. Many U.S.-licensed vaccines are already produced this way, such those for rotavirus, polio, smallpox, hepatitis, rubella and chickenpox, plus at least two flu vaccines. Thus, regulators should require manufacturers to phase out flu vaccines produced with inferior, 70-year-old technology.\n\nHowever, the holy grail of flu vaccines would be a \u201cuniversal\u201d vaccine that recognizes all strains, including newly-arising ones. Several different approaches are being pursued, but significant challenges remain. As noted above, the major difficulty is that the most immunogenic part of the flu virus \u2013 the hemagglutinin proteins on the surface of the virion \u2013 is the part that mutates, or drifts, from year to year, which is why vaccines need to be constantly updated. (That contrasts with the vaccines for other viral diseases such as measles and mumps, which confer long-standing immunity.)\n\nIn spite of the importance of research on universal vaccines and the variety of approaches, there is surprisingly meager federal research funding in this area. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, and writer Mark Olshaker tracked the government\u2019s investment in universal flu vaccine research: \u201cThe National Institutes of Health has publicly declared developing a [universal] vaccine a priority, [but] it has only about $32 million this year specifically for such research.\u201d\n\nAnother federal agency, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, is spending $43 million on a single project in pursuit of \u201cgame-changing influenza vaccines.\u201d\n\nThese are meager efforts when compared to the roughly $1 billion spent annually on developing an HIV vaccine and the many billions that have been spent on vaccines for the Zika and Ebola viruses, which have little relevance to Americans.\n\nWe also need more research on vaccine additives called \u201cadjuvants,\u201d chemicals mixed with the viral antigens to further boost the immune response.\n\nWithin the population, a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness varies widely because it is affected by the general health and age of the recipient. Although people 65 and older make up only 15 percent of the U.S. population, on average they account for about 60 percent of the hospitalizations and 90 percent of the deaths attributed to seasonal flu. Seniors respond less well to vaccines than younger people because, as we age, our immune system functions less well. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health, after reviewing 31 vaccine response studies comparing groups of different ages, called for more potent formulations for the elderly.\n\nBut exactly how strong the shot should be, and whether additional injections would boost immunity, requires more study. There is currently a flu vaccine for people over 65 that contains four times as much antigen as regular flu shots, and one that contains an adjuvant, but those tweaks have improved effectiveness only marginally.\n\nAn increase in research funding on adjuvants, more effective dosing regimens (especially for seniors), and better production methods are achievable changes that would better prepare us to face flu outbreaks.\n\nIn the meantime, an easy and much-neglected intervention would be for public health officials and the media to make the public more aware of the currently available anti-flu medications, Tamiflu, Relenza, and Rapivab, that can both prevent the flu and also shorten the duration and severity of the illness, should it occur. The development of a universal vaccine is more challenging but it promises much greater results, and deserves more support.\n\nThe fearsome 2017-2018 flu season should serve as a wake-up call: On several research and public health fronts, we need to redouble our efforts to prevent and treat the flu, especially via the development of improved vaccines. In the meantime, get a flu shot every year.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nVoters turned out in exceptional numbers Sunday to decide whether the French South Pacific territory of New Caledonia should break free from the European country that claimed it in the mid-19th century.\n\nThe territory's High Commissioner estimated that close to three-quarters of the territory's registered voters had cast ballots an hour before polls closed Sunday evening, a far more robust turnout than in New Caledonia's provincial election in 2014.\n\nResults were expected later Sunday. From Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron was to speak about the territory's future and its choice in a televised address.\n\nThe independence vote marked a milestone for the archipelago that lies east of Australia and has sun-kissed lagoons as well as a mining industry for nickel, a metal used in electronics manufacturing.\n\nMore than 174,000 registered voters were invited to answer the question: \"Do you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?\" At the 284 polling stations, they were given two slips of paper to choose from, one marked \"OUI\" (\"Yes\") and the other \"NON.\"\n\nVoter Monette Saihulinwa said she opposed independence.\n\n\"I don't necessarily want our lives to change,\" the 50-year-old said.\n\nOthers hailed the ballot as a landmark.\n\n\"We've been waiting for 30 years for this vote,\" said Mariola Bouyer, 34. \"This vote must demonstrate that we want to live in peace, no matter our race, our roots. It's building a country together.\"\n\nNew Caledonia relies on France for its defense, law enforcement, foreign affairs, justice and education, yet has a large degree of autonomy. New Caledonia receives about 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in French state subsidies every year, and many fear its economy would suffer if ties are severed.\n\nThe cluster of islands is home to about 270,000 people. They include the native Kanaks, about 40 percent of the population; people of European descent, about 27 percent; and others from Asian countries and Pacific islands.\n\nThe archipelago became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III \u2014 Napoleon's nephew and heir \u2014 and was used for decades as a prison colony. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957.\n\nMost Kanaks have tended to back independence, while most descendants of European settlers have favored keeping the French connection. Under French colonial rule, the Kanaks suffered under strict segregation policies and faced discrimination.\n\nThe referendum is the result of a process that started 30 years ago to end years of violence between supporters and opponents of separating from France.\n\nThe violence, which overall claimed more than 70 lives, prompted a 1988 deal between rival loyalist and pro-independence factions. Another agreement a decade later included plans for an independence referendum.\n\nIf voters say no to independence on Sunday, the 1998 agreement allows two more self-determination referendums to be held by 2022.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel will mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I on French soil, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will be in London at a ceremony in Westminster Abby with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBut while the leaders visit the capitals of Germany's wartime enemies, at home there are no national commemorations planned for the centenary of the Nov. 11 armistice that brought an end to the four-year war that killed more than 2 million of its troops and left 4 million wounded.\n\nNext week, German parliament is holding a combined commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the declaration of the first German republic, the 80th anniversary of the brutal Nazi-era pogrom against Jews known as the Night of Broken Glass, and the 29th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Almost as an afterthought, parliament notes there's also art exhibition in the lobby called \"1914/1918 - Not Then, Not Now, Not Ever.\"\n\nMore than just being on the losing side of the World War 1, it's what came next that is really behind Germany's lack of commemorative events.\n\nFor Germany, the Nov. 11 armistice did not mean peace like it did in France and Britain. The war's end gave rise to revolution and street fighting between far-left and far-right factions. It also brought an end to the monarchy, years of hyperinflation, widespread poverty and hunger, and helped create the conditions that brought the Nazis to power in 1933.\n\nThe horrific legacy of the Holocaust and the mass destruction of World War II simply overshadows everything else in Germany, said Daniel Schoenpflug, a historian at Berlin's Free University's Friedrich-Meinecke-Institute. His new book, \"A World on Edge,\" explores the immediate aftermath of the war through individual perspectives.\n\n\"One can't reduce it to the simple fact that one country won the war and the other lost,\" Schoenpflug said. \"Germany is a country that draws practically its entire national narrative out of the defeat of 1945\" \u2014 and not the defeat of 1918.\n\nBy contrast in Turkey, which was also on the losing side in World War I, the war's end produced a similar collapse of the Ottoman empire and a war of independence, but also gave rise to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic.\n\nIn Germany, even though the end of World War I is now viewed through the prism of Hitler and the Holocaust, in the immediate postwar period there actually was a period of utopianism, with movements promoting idealistic visions of peace and democracy, Schoenpflug said.\n\nYet on the other side of the political spectrum, utopianism on the right also gave birth to fascism, he said.\n\nAnd as initial euphoria over the end of World War I faded, hopes for the future quickly gave way to feelings of resentment at the reparations and conditions imposed on Germany by the victorious axis powers. The Nazis and right-wing nationalists were able to garner support by propagating the \"stab-in-the-back\" myth, which held that Germany's civilian leaders sold out the army by agreeing to the Nov. 11 surrender.\n\n\"There was a war of dreams, a clash of utopias\" between the right and the left, Schoenpflug said.\n\nAlthough there aren't any national commemorations in Germany marking the war's end, individual events are planned, including an exhibition at the German Historical Museum in Berlin. A special World War I religious service is also being organized by the German Bishops Conference at the Berliner Dom cathedral.\n\nAnd in addition to German officials taking part in the events in London and Paris, the Foreign Ministry said they and their British counterparts have worked together to coordinate the ringing of church and secular bells around the world on Nov. 11 to mark the war's centenary.\n\n\"The bells will ring at midday to commemorate the more than 17 million victims of World War I and as a call for understanding and reconciliation across borders,\" the ministry said.", "Thousands of Iranians rallied in Tehran on Sunday to mark the 39th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover, as Washington restored all sanctions lifted under the nuclear deal.\n\nThe crowd chanted \"Down with U.S.\" and \"Death to Israel\" during the rally in the capital, and state TV said similar demonstrations were held in other cities and towns.\n\nIranian students stormed the embassy shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. cut off diplomatic relations in response.\n\nIran's clerically-led government celebrates the embassy takeover every year as a decisive blow against the United States, which had supported the autocratic rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The embassy compound, widely known as the \"den of spies,\" is now a cultural center.\n\nAnger and distrust of the United States is surging again following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers despite Tehran's compliance with the agreement, which was negotiated under the Obama administration.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration announced the restoration of sanctions on Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors, the second batch of penalties to be restored.\n\nIran is already in the grip of an economic crisis, and has seen sporadic protests in recent months as Iranian officials have tried to downplay the sanctions and their effects.\n\nThe United States says the sanctions are not aimed at toppling the government, but at persuading it to radically change its policies, including its support for regional militant groups and its development of long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nAt a gathering on Saturday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, portrayed the sanctions as part of a long tradition of American hostility toward the Islamic Republic, which he said had nevertheless prevailed.", "An investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh by multiple women found that no witnesses could provide evidence to substantiate their claims, a letter to Senate Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman said Friday.\n\nAccording to the 414-page report released by Sen.

The day's 124-mile (200-kilometer) trek was one of the longest yet, as the exhausted migrants tried to make progress walking and hitching rides toward the U.S. border still hundreds of miles away.\n\nThe migrants now aim to regroup in the Mexican capital, seeking medical care and rest while they await stragglers. The caravan has found strength in numbers as it meanders north, with townspeople pouring out to offer food, water, fresh clothes and replacement footwear.\n\nIn a thundering voice vote Sunday night, about 1,000 migrants at the gymnasium in Cordoba voted to try to make it to Mexico City on Monday, which would be their longest single-day journey yet since the caravan began \u2014 178 miles (286 kilometers) by the shortest route.\n\nEarlier Sunday, the bulk of the caravan streamed into the colonial city of Cordoba, in Veracruz's sugar belt, where they were greeted with Caribbean music and dance. Meanwhile, bleary eyed migrants who had charged ahead to Mexico City expressed gratitude for the support of their fellow travelers, saying they would not have had the strength or courage to get so far on their own.\n\nA few arrived at a large outdoor stadium in the capital, where they lounged on bleachers and watched Mexicans play soccer. City employees piled hot food onto Styrofoam plates for the migrants, some of whom had hopped freight trucks to speed their arrival to the capital. Others rested inside a church in the city of Puebla.\n\nIt is unclear what part of the U.S. border the caravan will aim for eventually, or how many may splinter off on their own.\n\nMost of the migrants said they remain convinced that traveling as a large mass is their best hope for reaching the U.S. The migrants generally say they are fleeing rampant poverty, gang violence and political instability primarily in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.\n\n\"We think that it is better to continue together with the caravan. We are going to stay with it and respect the organizers,\" said Luis Euseda, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, traveling with his wife, Jessica Fugon. \"Others went ahead, maybe they have no goal, but we do have a goal and it is to arrive.\"\n\nMynor Chavez, a 19-year-old from Copan, Honduras, was also determined to continue.\n\n\"I have no prospects (in Honduras).

He dreams of making it back to the U.S., from which he was deported a little more than two years ago.\n\nOn the road, Calderon was received by ordinary Mexicans lending a hand. Catalina Munoz said she bought tortillas on credit to assemble tacos of beans, cheese and rice when she heard the migrant caravan would pass through her tiny town of 3,000 inhabitants. She gathered 15 others to help make the tacos, fill water bottles and carry fruit to weary travelers on the roadside.\n\nMexico faces the unprecedented situation of having three migrant caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz.\n\nOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing around 1,000 people who want to reach the U.S. border. That caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 people, entered Mexico early last week. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nThe first, and largest, group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19.\n\nMexican officials have appeared conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journey.\n\nMexico's Interior Ministry estimated Saturday that there are more than 5,000 migrants in total currently moving through southern Mexico via caravans or in smaller groups. The ministry says 2,793 migrants have pursued refugee status in Mexico in recent weeks and around 500 have asked for assistance to return to their countries of origin.\n\nUncertainty awaits migrants who reach the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHe plans to sign an order that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Guthrie in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "Californians aiming to promote conservative leaders and causes ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election plan to gather in Sacramento on Sunday, potentially setting the stage for a clash with counter-protesters.\n\nOrganizers of the \u201cTurn California Red\u201d rally say supporters will assemble outside the state Capitol at 1 p.m. local time.

Obama and his liberal brethren, of course, are blissfully above that.\n\n\u201cIn the closing weeks of this election we have seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric designed to make us angry and make us fearful,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to exploit our history of racial and ethnic and religious division that pits us against one another and makes us believe that order will somehow be restored if it just weren\u2019t for those folks who don\u2019t look like we look or don\u2019t love like we love or pray like we do. \u2026 But in four days, Florida, you can reject that kind of politics \u2026 you can choose a bigger, more prosperous, more generous vision of America, an America where love and hope conquer hate.\u201d\n\nIs President Trump really that divisive? Or are his liberal antagonists who are pushing that narrative incapable of perceiving a conservative message as anything other than divisive?\n\nThe liberal media paint Trump as the most divisive president in history in their comprehensive daily smears of every action he takes and every statement he makes. It makes no difference that he\u2019s often just responding to their daily invective because, by definition, they can\u2019t be divisive. They\u2019re just presenting the facts \u2013 or so they tell us.\n\nThey point to President Trump\u2019s tweets and his condemnation of \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 but what really agitates the liberal media is that this president has the audacity to hit back, even though they\u2019ve drawn first blood. They\u2019re not used to being served their own medicine.\n\nTo liberals, divisiveness means a refusal to acquiesce to their leftist policy demands. They never consider their own dogmatic, uncompromising agenda to be divisive.\n\nPresident Obama talks a good game now, but don\u2019t forget that in office he regarded his own ideas as sacrosanct and was incredulous that anyone could possibly oppose him in good faith. He considered his policies to be self-evidently superior, so told us that Republicans opposed him solely out of crass partisanship.\n\nAnd when Republicans objected, Obama arrogantly reminded them that he won the election and didn\u2019t want them to do a lot of talking. Yet the media covered for Obama.\n\nIn contrast, the liberal media often intentionally distort the facts to damage Trump politically. But in some cases they seem to really believe their own narrow-minded propaganda. To me, this is more alarming than when they are being deliberately biased and falsely denying it.\n\nFrom their hermetically sealed echo chamber where uniformity of ideas is nearly absolute, the liberal media don\u2019t regard their opinions as political. In fact, they\u2019re not really even opinions. They\u2019re objective, undeniable observations.\n\nAccording to the liberal media, those who disagree with the wise men and women who bring us the news don\u2019t have a legitimately differing opinion; they are just wrong and immoral. There is the reasonable (liberal) view and there is the aberrant view. Those are the only two choices.\n\nRational people understand, the leftist media tell us, that liberal taxing, spending and redistribution are reality-based. So too are expansive government dependency programs, expansive abortion \u201crights,\u201d and a slavish devotion to \u201cclimate change\u201d policies. Those who oppose these views? They are fact-challenged, we are told.\n\nLiberal conceit has been around for ages, which explains the liberal media\u2019s shock that anyone could accuse them of bias.\n\nI remember years ago watching a panel with major TV network news hosts \u2013 such as Ted Koppel, Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather \u2013 discussing media bias. I was struck by their smug view that they were professional journalists who presented the news objectively and without bias. It didn\u2019t even occur to them that their biases seeped into their selection and presentation of news stories. It doesn\u2019t occur to their liberal media successors today.\n\nI don\u2019t deny that we\u2019re going through a highly divisive period in our country, but it goes both ways. Of course we should all be civil, but in a nation as politically polarized as America, where opposing political parties no longer even share many of the same basic goals, isn\u2019t it unrealistic to expect perfect harmony?\n\nBitter division isn\u2019t new to the republic; it has been with us from the beginning. Indeed, the framers of our Constitution \u2013 knowing that human beings are not angels and that power corrupts \u2013 designed our constitutional system with checks and balances to pit competing interests against one another as part of their scheme to limit government and maximize liberty.\n\nSo could we please have a little less posturing and handwringing from the liberal media, which are even more to blame for the conflict than President Trump?\n\nHiding behind their self-declared status as \u201cjournalists,\u201d those in the liberal media berate the president around the clock and demand that he passively submit, lest he criticize them back and threaten their First Amendment rights. What charlatans! President Trump has done nothing to suppress their liberties and they know it. They claim to be government watchdogs, but they are really just doctrinaire mad dogs.\n\nMembers of the liberal media pretend to be innocent victims, but they are reveling in the noise they\u2019re generating. They insist on smearing President Trump as divisive even when he\u2019s trying to be conciliatory, such as when they castigated him for visiting Pittsburgh to pay his respects to the synagogue shooting victims.\n\nThe liberal media's efforts to discredit Trump have backfired because they have lost their credibility. Let them continue and the backlash from Trump supporters will only multiply.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nA convoy of 78 trucks carrying life-saving assistance reached a remote camp for the displaced on Syria's border with Jordan on Saturday, where tens of thousands of people are stranded in the desert amid dwindling supplies.\n\nThe United Nations and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent said their joint convoy reached Rukban camp and would deliver assistance to 50,000 people The convoy was supposed to arrive last week but was delayed due to logistics and security concerns.

Jordan sealed its border and stopped regular aid deliveries in 2016 after a cross-border IS attack that killed seven Jordanian soldiers.\n\nThe last aid delivery from Jordan was in January, leaving the camp's residents dependent on goods largely smuggled from government-held areas.

Kavanaugh was asked about the allegations in an interview with investigators, where the future Justice called the allegations a \u201ccrock\u201d and a \u201cfarce.\u201d\n\nThat allegation came amid Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing and during a firestorm over allegations that he sexually assaulted women in high school and college. Kavanaugh fiercely denied all the allegations, and both Kavanaugh and Republicans blasted Democrats for their handling of the allegations. Democrats have promised to keep investigating some of the claims made against Kavanaugh.\n\nIn early October, committee staff received an email from Munro-Leighton saying that she was the Jane Doe from California who sent the letter and that \u201cKavanaugh raped me.\u201d But investigators went on to determine that Munro-Leighton was a left-wing activist, decades older than Kavanaugh and lives in Kentucky.\n\n\u201cUnder questioning by Committee investigators, Ms. Munro-Leighton admitted, contrary to her prior claims, that she had not been sexually assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh and was not the author of the original 'Jane Doe\u2019 letter,\u201d Grassley\u2019s office wrote in a Friday referral to the Department of Justice.\n\n\u201cWhen directly asked by Committee investigators if she was, as she had claimed, the \u2018Jane Doe\u2019 from Oceanside California who had sent the letter to Senator Harris, she admitted: \u2018No, no, no. I did that as a way to grab attention. I am not Jane Doe...but I did read Jane Doe\u2019s letter. I read the transcript of the call to your Committee...I saw it online. It was news.\u201d\n\nAccording to the referral, she also admitted she had never even met Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cIn short, during the Committee\u2019s time-sensitive investigation of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Munro-Leighton submitted a fabricated allegation, which diverted Committee resources,\u201d Grassley\u2019s office said.\n\nTrump was not the only White House official to weigh in on the development.

The Bureau of Immigration ordered her deported in July, put her on a blacklist and then downgraded her missionary visa to a temporary visitor's visa, which expires Saturday.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte has bristled at criticism of his leadership, particularly by foreigners like Fox, who he says have no right to meddle in Philippine domestic affairs. Most of the criticism has focused on his bloody anti-drug campaign, which has left thousands dead, alarmed Western governments and rights groups and prompted two complaints of mass murder before the International Criminal Court.\n\nDuring a farewell news conference in a Catholic school before leaving for the Manila airport with a convoy of supporters, the 71-year-old Fox called on Filipinos to speak up and help the marginalized fight to gain land, houses and jobs.\n\n\"The big challenge now is not to lose hope, to know that if we all move together, we can bring about change,\" Fox said.\n\n\"Pope Francis said that if you're a Christian and there's massive human rights violations ... you should take action, make noise. Where the oppressed are, the church people should be there, not only always talking but with them and hopefully more vocal,\" she said.\n\nFox told The Associated Press separately by phone that Duterte's anti-drug crackdown was \"horribly barbaric\" and she vowed to return to the country if allowed to resume her 27 years of missionary work for the poor.\n\n\"I know a lot of mothers, wives who have lost someone. You have no right to take a life just like that without justice,\" Fox said.\n\nDozens of activists, laborers, priests, nuns and tribal folk thanked Fox by celebrating a mass in her honor before sending her off to the airport. A lawyers group backing Fox, the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers, said that by persecuting a frail and low-key missionary, Duterte has turned her into an \"overnight rock star.\"\n\nKnown for being soft-spoken, Fox is a coordinator of a Roman Catholic order of nuns and has worked for the poor in the Philippines. She promotes human rights and the welfare of workers, farmers and ethnic groups and has spoken against Duterte and his government, which has also been criticized for stifling dissent.\n\nThe immigration bureau said Fox violated her missionary visa by venturing far beyond her community in suburban Quezon city in metropolitan Manila and interfered in domestic politics by joining protests and news conferences that tackled \"political and human rights issues against the government.\"\n\nFox's lawyers said she joined the marginalized as part of her missionary work and called the Duterte administration's actions \"political persecution.\" They expressed fears that the move to evict Fox could undermine the crucial civic and religious work of foreign missionaries in the country.\n\nAside from Fox, the government has separately blocked a critical Italian politician, Giacomo Filibeck, and another Australian, Gill Hale Boehringer, from entering the Philippines this year.\n\n\"The law is clear: The entry and admission of an alien is a matter of privilege, and not a right,\" Bureau of Immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval said Saturday.", "You walk into a grocery store and pick up eggs.

It enables access management in a way that protects individual self-sovereignty and allows users to control the privacy of their online activity,\u201d Dr. Stewart Southey, the Chief Medical Officer at Biohax International, told Fox News.\n\nAnother doctor agrees that getting \u201cchipped\u201d is practical and even advantageous. As far back as 2014, experts have outlined a number of benefits, some medical and some consumer-based.\n\n\u201cFrom a medical perspective, in the ER we have patients come in every day who are confused or comatose and we cannot get any medical history from them,\u201d says Dr. Larry Burchett, a medical expert and author who runs DoctorLarry.com. \u201cIf we had access to that info because they have a chip in their skin, that could be lifesaving.\u201d\n\nHOW AI FIGHTS THE WAR AGAINST FAKE NEWS\n\n\u201cWe implant many things now -- insulin pumps, pain pumps, birth control -- under the skin,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere are risks of infection, but they are low. I don't think those risks are a big deal.\u201d\n\nHowever, a number of states, including California and Missouri, have already implemented regulations on chip implants. The technology has come under serious scrutiny, and they are illegal if an employer or medical professional mandates their use. The RFID chips, which work like the ones you might implant surgically into a pet or staple to a FedEx box, are controversial because of the long-term ethical implications.\n\n\u201cI shudder at the thought of a world like that, where vanity cyborg commerce becomes a game of one-upmanship, a challenge to see who can have the highest percentage cyber by weight or wattage,\u201d says Roger Kay, a consultant at Endpoint Technologies Associates. \u201cFor disabilities, it may make sense in specific use cases, like handicap door opening. I draw the line well before paying for things. But I don't want an iPhone embedded anywhere in my body.\u201d\n\nHACKERS ARE SELLING BABIES' PERSONAL DATA ON THE DARK WEB\n\nThe experts argue that there may be some limited use for medical reasons. A chip that monitors blood pressure or diabetes would be \u201cvery interesting\u201d says Dr. Burchett. Dr. Southey says there are applications in the transportation industry as well.\n\nKay is not so sure.\n\n\u201cI could imagine that morphing over to the tracking of prisoners, and from there, a dystopian vision of assigning tracking chips to political rivals, and then, of course, to the general populace, like social security numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cI rather hope not to be alive when that happens.\u201d\n\n6 GADGETS FOR A MUCH SMARTER SMART HOME\n\nThere are at least 4,000 people in Sweden who have accepted all of the implications.\n\nMaybe they are already sick and tired of carrying around a smartphone all day.\n\n", "Comedian Bill Maher blasted President Trump on Friday night, accusing Trump of fearmongering about the migrant caravan.\n\nThe \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d host criticized the president's rhetoric over thousands of migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America.\n\n\u201cTrump is like a racist Paul Revere. \u2018The migrants are coming!

He said the situation in Yemen now to his last visit in 2017 is deteriorating, adding that \"the war is taking hostage millions of Yemenis who can't afford basic needs.\"\n\nYemen has been at war since March 2015 when Houthis occupied northern Yemen, forcing the government into exile, resulting in a Saudi-led coalition being formed to support the government that has waged a destructive air campaign in the country.\n\nSaudi Arabia, an ally of the US - which sells weapons worth billions of dollars and provides logistical support to the coalition - has come under heavy criticism for its conduct of the war that has left thousands dead and injured.\n\n\"An end to the conflict is ... a much-needed step but it needs to be complemented with investment and governance of this country that puts the interest of the people at the center and the interest of the children at the core of politics,\" Cappelaere said.\n\nThree-quarters of Yemen's 29 million people are food insecure, 1.8 children suffer from malnutrition and 400,000 children under age 5 are in the worst stage of malnutrition - without intervention they might die. Every 10 minutes a child dies of preventable diseases.\n\n\"This is not an overstatement,\" Cappelaere said.\n\nAround 40 percent of the 400,000 are located in Hodeida and its surroundings. Up to 5.5 million people might be added to the number of food insecure because of price hikes caused by the freefall in value of the local currency. Around 90 percent of Yemen's needs are imported from overseas.\n\nWhile in Hodeida, the lifeline of the Houthi-controlled north, Cappelaere said he learned that families can't make it to the hospital because of constant fear of airstrikes and shelling or because they have no money to pay for transportation.\n\nYemeni forces under the command of the United Arab Emirates, a major pillar in the anti-Houthi coalition, are battling Houthis over control of the port and the coalition accuses Houthis of using the port to smuggle in weapons from Iran.\n\nIn his visit to Hodeida's main hospital, he saw cases of severe acute malnourished and children paralyzed by complications from diphtheria - an epidemic in Yemen.\n\n\"It's high time for authorities from both sides to take responsibility and enable that assistance without any conditions, without any hurdles,\" he said.", "In the latest gaffe in her bid for re-election, U.S. Sen.

New Caledonia receives about 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in French state subsidies every year, and many fear the economy would suffer if ties are severed.\n\nThe referendum is the result of a process that started 30 years ago to end years of violence between supporters and opponents of separating from France.\n\nThe violence, which overall claimed more than 70 lives, prompted a 1988 deal between rival loyalist and pro-independence factions. Another agreement a decade later included plans for an independence referendum.\n\nMost Kanaks have tended to back independence, while most descendants of European settlers have favored keeping the French connection.\n\nTo ensure security during the vote, additional police were sent to New Caledonia.

The maintenance has been known about for weeks.\n\nInstead he offered to have the migrants taken to another city in Veracruz until the problem in Mexico City is resolved.\n\n\"I want to make an offer to the migrants that while this problem is being resolved they accept my invitation to go to a city in Veracruz\" that has the conditions to host them, he said.\n\nMigrants expressed surprise and disappointment at the decision, and it was not immediately known what they would do Saturday.\n\n\"We believe it was a manipulation and a game played with the sentiments of the migrants,\" said 21-year-old migrant Osman Quiroz. \"It is disagreeable news since the people were happy.\"\n\nCaravan organizers released a statement rejecting Yunes' decision and demanding that he fulfill his offer of buses to Mexico City.\n\nThe offer of buses to Mexico City and the subsequent reversal came after the migrants' request for buses to the capital were ignored by the Mexican government days earlier when they were in Juchitan, Oaxaca state.\n\nEarlier in the day, a third caravan of migrants \u2014 this time from El Salvador \u2014 waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico on Friday, bringing another 1,000 to 1,500 people who want to reach the U.S. border.\n\nThe third caravan tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told those traveling in it they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nThe Salvadorans expressed misgivings that they would be deported, so they turned around and waded across a shallow stretch of the river to enter Mexico.\n\nAlthough police were present, they did not try to physically stop the migrants, who later walked along a highway toward the nearest large city, Tapachula.\n\nMexico is now faced with the unprecedented situation of having three caravans stretched out over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highways in the southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca, with a total of about 6,000 migrants. The first, largest group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct. 19.\n\nThough the first caravan once numbered as many as 7,000, it has shrunk significantly. It has been hard to know their exact numbers as people scatter across highways and in small towns.\n\nThe second caravan, also of about 1,000 to 1,500 people, entered Mexico earlier this week and is now in Mapastepec, Chiapas. The second group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans. In addition, the government identified a fourth, smaller group of 300 Central American migrants walking further ahead, in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.\n\nIt remained unclear how many migrants would make it; 20 days of scorching heat, constant walking, chills, rain and illness had taken their toll. Mexico's Interior Department says nearly 3,000 of the migrants in the first caravan have applied for refuge in Mexico; hundreds more have returned home.\n\nHonduran migrant Saul Guzman, 48, spent the night under a tin roof in the Oaxaca state town of Matias Romero with his son Dannys, 12, before setting out for the town of Donaji, 30 miles (47 kilometers) north.\n\n\"I have been through a lot,\" said Guzman. \"I want to spend my time differently, not in poverty.\"\n\nThe migrants made a grueling 40-mile (65-kilometer) trek from Juchitan, Oaxaca, on Thursday, after they failed to get the bus transportation they had hoped for. Hitching rides on Friday allowed them to arrive early at their destination for the day, Donaji, and some headed to a town even farther north, Sayula.\n\nImmigration agents and police have been nibbling at the edges of the first two caravans.\n\nA federal official who was not authorized to be quoted by name said 153 migrants in the second caravan were detained Wednesday during highway inspections in Chiapas, a short distance from the Guatemalan border.\n\nThere has also been pressure on the first caravan. Federal police began pulling freight trucks over and forcing migrants off, saying their habit of clinging to the tops or sides of the trucks was dangerous.\n\nAt other points along the route, police have forced overloaded pickups to drop off migrants. On previous days, they have ordered passenger vans to stop helping with transportation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans of migrants. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California.\n\nTrump says has told the U.S. military mobilizing at the southwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \"rifles.\" He also plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.\n\nThough some migrants clashed with Mexican police at a bridge on the Guatemala border, they have repeatedly denied coming with any ill intentions, saying they're fleeing poverty and violence.\n\n\"We aren't killers,\" said Stephany Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran with the first caravan.\n\nSimilar caravans have occurred regularly over the years and passed largely unnoticed, but Trump has focused on the latest marchers seeking to make border security a hot-button issue in next week's midterm elections.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Peter Orsi in Mexico City contributed to this report.", "next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nAs President Donald Trump ramped up his anti-migrant rhetoric ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections, exhausted Central Americans walking across Mexico in hopes of reaching the United States said they were mostly perplexed and turned off by his threats, which they perceive as exaggerated.\n\nThe U.S. president has spent the final days of the campaign hammering the issue as he tries to energize Republican voters, and his favorite target has been the migrant caravan of almost 4,000 people that is still more than 800 miles away from the nearest U.S. border. Three smaller ones are following behind it.\n\nTrump's recent statements include that he plans to sign an order that could lead to the detention of migrants crossing the southern border, and barring anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum. Both propositions are legally dubious. Trump also said he had told the U.S. military mobilizing at the southwest border that if U.S. troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were \"rifles.\"\n\n\"It is pure ignorance for him to think like that,\" said Marta Cuellos, a 40-year-old from Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. \"A rock is not the same as a rifle.\"\n\nWhile some migrants have clashed with Mexican police at a bridge on the Guatemala border, most of those traveling with the caravans have been peaceful and say they are fleeing violence and poverty at home. Those traveling through the southern state of Oaxaca on Friday said they are not looking for trouble.\n\nCuellos said she owned a cantina back home in Honduras but left because she could no longer make rent and was being harassed by police. She persuaded her 35-year-old sister to join her on the trip, and said the only thing they want is work and a better life in the United States. It's her second attempt. She first crossed into the U.S. seven years ago but was deported last year.\n\nSelvin Maldonado, a 25-year-old from Copan, Honduras, said he left his wife and baby daughter at home in search of a better living to support his children. He took his 5-year-old son, Dennys, with him.\n\n\"What Trump said is stupid,\" Maldonado said while walking to the town of Donaji. \"I don't want to attack police, because my concern is my son.\"\n\nThe migrants also were also turned off by the U.S. president's characterization of the slow-moving caravan and the three smaller ones following as \"invasion.\" Trump has proposed detaining migrants in massive tent cities at the border.\n\n\"We are not killers,\" said Stephany Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran with the first caravan. \"We just want to work for a few years, and after that he can deport us if he wants.\"\n\nLopez noted that the president's mother, who was born in Scotland, was an immigrant.\n\n\"He should think of us as equals. Immigrants have built that country,\" she said.\n\nIn June, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that domestic and gang violence would generally no longer be accepted as reasons for migrants to be granted asylum. Trump has said this week that those in the caravan would not get asylum \u2014 though U.S. law allows them the right to apply \u2014 and warned them to turn around.\n\nThe Trump administration's vehement opposition and tough rhetoric has at least some in the caravan weighing alternatives.\n\nTifany Morandis, 19, was traveling with her husband, 28-year-old Javier Sanchez, and their two sons, 7-year-old Angel and 9-month-old Cesar. Her nose and face sun-scorched after many days on the road, she said she was very tired and is considering stopping in Tijuana, the Mexican border city across from San Diego.\n\n\"Donald Trump has made things very complicated at the border, and better that we stay in Tijuana than fight with him,\" Morandis said.\n\nBut many are hopeful. \"Even stones can soften,\" Cuellos said.", "A shooter in Florida is dead after opening fire at a hot yoga studio in Tallahassee on Friday evening, killing at least two people and wounding several others before likely killing himself, police said.\n\nBut things could have been much worse, if not for a man who charged at the suspect, one nearby witness said.\n\nFlorida state Sen.

His wife and daughter stopped cooperating and a grand jury refused to indict him, FOX 12 Oregon reported.\n\nThe body of his wife, Coral Rodriguez-Lorenzo, 38, of Portland, was found near the Sandy River in the Bull Run-Sandy area east of Portland.
