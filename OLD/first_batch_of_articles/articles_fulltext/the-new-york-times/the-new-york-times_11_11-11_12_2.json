["The attempt by Trump and his party to shut down the legally mandated Florida recount with claims, based on no evidence, of large-scale voting fraud fits right into this partisan epistemology. Do Republicans really believe that there were vast numbers of fraudulent or forged ballots? Even asking that question is a category error. They don\u2019t \u201creally believe\u201d anything, except that they should get what they want. Any vote count that might favor a Democrat is bad for them; therefore it\u2019s fraudulent, no evidence needed.\n\nThe same worldview explains Republicans\u2019 addiction to conspiracy theories. After all, if people keep insisting on the truth of something that hurts their party, it can\u2019t be out of respect for the facts \u2014 because in their world, there are no neutral facts.\n\nSo the people making inconvenient assertions must be in the pay of sinister forces. In Arizona, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema won a Senate seat on the strength of late-counted ballots. Did you know that the state G.O.P. has filed a freedom of information request for information on interactions between election officials and, you guessed it, George Soros?\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out, by the way, that this rejection of objective facts and insistence that anyone insisting on inconvenient truths must be part of a left-wing conspiracy dominated the Republican psyche long before Trump. Most notably, the claim that the overwhelming evidence for global warming is a giant hoax, the product of a vast plot involving thousands of scientists around the world, has been G.O.P. orthodoxy for years.\n\nTrue, the party\u2019s presidential candidates used to be mealy-mouthed about rejecting facts and endorsing conspiracy theories, rather than being full-throated crazy. But Trump is only going where many of his party\u2019s senior figures have been for a long time.", "A settlement announced Monday between the N.H.L. and several hundred retired hockey players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of repeated head hits did little to quell the emotional intensity surrounding the issue.\n\nThe deal, which must be approved by the 318 former players who joined the lawsuit, includes free neuropsychological tests, up to $75,000 for medical treatment, a potential cash payment of about $20,000 a player, and the establishment of a Common Good Fund to help other players in need.\n\nThe settlement will undoubtedly bring a trickle of money to players in need and is a minor legal achievement, given the resources and resolve of the N.H.L., which used brass knuckles to fight the players at every turn. But few on the plaintiff side will be happy with a deal that provides little long-term security for retired players who are suffering.\n\n\u201cThe N.H.L.\u2019s philosophy was scorched earth and deny every issue,\u201d said Charles Zimmerman, the lead lawyer for the retired hockey players. \u201cThey denied the link between neurocognitive problems and the game of hockey, and felt that the players were not injured and wouldn\u2019t participate in large numbers. They were right on that.\u201d", "So the city dropped the plan.\n\nAmazon also insisted on nondisclosure agreements from the 238 cities bidding for HQ2. Scandalously, American cities and states now spend some $90 billion a year in cash and tax incentives to attract companies, money that could go for infrastructure, schools and police, and that usually doesn\u2019t pay off, as Derek Thompson pointed out this week in The Atlantic. Amazon\u2019s nondisclosure clause set up a process that allowed it, in effect, to crowdsource vast swaths of information about cities while preventing their citizens from knowing what their elected officials were doing to entice the $860 billion company.\n\nThis is certainly not how New Yorkers like to operate.\n\nIf New York hadn\u2019t landed Amazon, it would not have been a surprise if Dallas had. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, apparently has a home in Texas, too. Scott Galloway, the business analyst and Amazon expert, tweeted a funny-but-true image showing the proximity between Mr. Bezos\u2019 homes and the company\u2019s current and prospective headquarters.\n\nSilly as it sounds, where bosses live turns out to be as good a predictor as any of where tech companies will settle.\n\nFor years, suburbia has offered these companies acres of disposable, cheap, anonymous office parks: mostly one- or two-story concrete structures surrounded by loads of surface parking. These sites minimized costs, maximized security and allowed companies to scale up, contract or split into different units quickly \u2014 at the same time they promoted sprawl and traffic jams and transformed once-quaint bedroom communities south of San Francisco into phenomenally expensive places to live.\n\nNot that young tech workers, more and more of them immigrants, wanted to live in suburbia, anyway. Increasingly they demanded the diversity and benefits of city life. And so did successful innovation companies, following the lead of workers.\n\nAnother way to put it is that companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon became attracted to cities like New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington because these cities had already made transformative public investments in assets like culture, parks, universities and transit.", "1. Powerful wildfires raged in Northern and Southern California, pushed by strong winds.\n\nThe inferno that ravaged the wooded town of Paradise in northern California became the deadliest wildfire in the state\u2019s modern history on Monday when officials said they had discovered the remains of 13 more people, bringing the death toll to 42.\n\nThe Butte County sheriff, Kory L. Honea, has said more than 200 people remain missing in and around the town, which sits in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and was popular with retirees.\n\nThe Woolsey Fire, west of Los Angeles, has killed two and charred 90,000 acres around Malibu and Thousand Oaks.", "Herbert Ira London was born in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, on March 6, 1939, a grandson of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father, Jack, a lapsed socialist, sold fabric, leather and vinyl for upholstery. His mother, Esta (Epstein) London, was a homemaker. He once described his upbringing as \u201cJewish Calvinist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always think about my dad because I think there are a lot of people like my father who could never understand why there were a growing number of people in our society who were feeding out of the public trough,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1994. \u201cHe paid his taxes and never derived any benefits from government. That\u2019s why I refer to him as the quintessential forgotten New Yorker.\u201d\n\nDr. London was raised in Forest Hills, Queens, and graduated from Jamaica High School, where a teacher instilled in him a lifelong habit of writing at least one page a day. He helped lead the school\u2019s basketball team to a city championship in 1955. Years later, he recalled a game in which he had scored 19 points by the end of the first quarter, with his team leading by 20.\n\n\u201cI felt confident of breaking the school scoring record and perhaps the city record as well, but to my dismay the coach took me out of the game,\u201d Dr. London wrote in 2012 on mindingthecampus.org. \u201cI was furious. Yet in retrospect, he was right. Had I broken the school record, it would have come at the expense of a marginal team. Moreover, it would have embarrassed the other players. My coach understood what I did not.\u201d\n\nHe went on to Columbia College on a basketball scholarship and made the starting team. There, originally enrolled in a pre-med curriculum, he was transformed by a course in contemporary civilization and humanities. Influenced by the professors Jacques Barzun, Samuel Huntington and Daniel Bell, he pivoted toward an academic career.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts strayed from the hardwood to dusty stacks in Butler Library,\u201d he recalled in a memoir, \u201cDiary of a Dean\u201d (2010).", "What turned out to be, in a sense, a career-making job came along in 1960, when Mr. Rain narrated a Canadian documentary about astronomy and space called \u201cUniverse.\u201d It caught Mr. Kubrick\u2019s attention; he is said to have watched it scores of times. And when he was having trouble finding a voice that he liked for HAL 9000 \u2014 the onboard computer on a spaceship carrying astronauts on a mysterious mission \u2014 he thought of the documentary\u2019s narration.\n\n\u201c2001\u201d had already been shot, and various concepts for the voice of HAL had been tried. At one point the computer was envisioned as female. The actor Martin Balsam recorded HAL\u2019s lines but was deemed not quite right. During filming, the British actor Nigel Davenport read the lines off-camera for a time for the benefit of Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, who played the astronauts, and then Mr. Kubrick had an assistant director, also British, do it.\n\nMr. Kubrick, not satisfied with any of those, sought out Mr. Rain. They met at a recording studio outside London. Mr. Rain recorded his lines in a day and a half, with Mr. Kubrick, who died in 1999, explaining the scenes to him and giving him only the sparsest of directorial notes.\n\nMr. Rain\u2019s rendition of the lines (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that\u201d) was dispassionate in a way that was both soothing and unsettling. His readings were cool to the point of being chilling, especially as the story moved along and HAL became malevolent.", "\u201cWe need to be careful what we say,\u201d said the judge, Jack Tuter, rejecting a request by Mr. Scott to impound unused voting machines and ballots. \u201cThese words mean things these days, as everybody in the room knows.\u201d\n\nIt was a busy weekend for undecided elections in Florida and elsewhere. Here\u2019s a recap of where things stand today:\n\n\u2022 The first full, statewide vote recount in Florida history started on Saturday for races for governor, Senate and agriculture secretary. The deadline for the recount, which is being performed by machines, is Thursday at 3 p.m. But if the machine recount comes back with a margin of .25 percentage points or less, the state will begin a manual recount.\n\nMost of the attention is focused on the Senate race, where unofficial election results show Mr. Scott leading Mr. Nelson by just .14 percentage points. A big question is why the Democratic bastion of Broward County saw about 25,000 fewer votes counted for Senate than governor, a number way out of whack with other counties. Poor ballot design may be a reason. There are also overseas and provisional ballots still to be counted.\n\n\u2022 In Arizona\u2019s Senate race, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat, was declared the winner late on Monday. The race was close, but the tallying was also slow by design \u2014 a majority of voters in the state cast early ballots and vote by mail, and counting all their votes can take time.\n\n\u2022In Georgia, Democrats are trying to push Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee for governor, below 50 percent of the vote, triggering a runoff election later this year. The campaign of Stacey Abrams, the Democrat, says an additional 25,632 votes would push the race into a runoff; Mr. Kemp\u2019s office says there are only about 25,000 votes outstanding. His share dropped slightly over the weekend, to 50.28 from 50.33 . Ms. Abrams\u2019s lawyers filed a lawsuit on Sunday to force the counting of more provisional ballots and to push back the state\u2019s certification of election results until at least Wednesday.\n\n\u2022In the House, Democrats keep expanding their margin as results roll in. Currently, the party has claimed at least 32 seats \u2014 up from 26 on election night. Results in 10 races are outstanding.\n\n[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every evening.]\n\n____________________\n\nBehind Trump\u2019s wildfire tweet", "WASHINGTON \u2014 Shortly after the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated last month, a member of the kill team instructed a superior over the phone to \u201ctell your boss,\u201d believed to be Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, that the operatives had carried out their mission, according to three people familiar with a recording of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing collected by Turkish intelligence.\n\nThe recording, shared last month with the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, is seen by intelligence officials as some of the strongest evidence linking Prince Mohammed to the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist whose death prompted an international outcry.\n\nWhile the prince was not mentioned by name, American intelligence officials believe \u201cyour boss\u201d was a reference to Prince Mohammed. Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, one of 15 Saudis dispatched to Istanbul to confront Mr. Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate there, made the phone call and spoke in Arabic, the people said.\n\nTurkish intelligence officers have told American officials they believe that Mr. Mutreb, a security officer who frequently traveled with Prince Mohammed, was speaking to one of the prince\u2019s aides. While translations of the Arabic may differ, the people briefed on the call said Mr. Mutreb also said to the aide words to the effect of \u201cthe deed was done.\u201d", "BEIJING \u2014 Wang Miaoyi's small one-bedroom apartment, which doubles as her design studio, is overflowing with game magazines, figurines and boxes of sci-fi novels.\n\nThe 30-year old game developer is a child of the county's tech boom: she studied at one of China's top universities and her company hit it big with an award-winning game that was published on Nintendo's Switch console and the PC gaming platform Steam, with plans for roll-out on other game platforms.\n\nNow her ambitions - and those of many others across China's giant tech industry - are facing a reckoning, amid rising state control over the sector, tightening regulation and a biting trade war with the United States stymieing growth.\n\n\"(In 2015) doing a start-up was popular.

There are four key ingredients.]\n\nA 2015 report by the United States Department of Agriculture found that between 2000 and 2010 (the last year for which data was available), the number of people moving into the wildland-urban interface had increased by 5 percent . According to the report, 44 million houses, equivalent to one in every three houses in the country, are in the wildland-urban interface. The highest concentrations are in Florida, Texas and, yes, California.\n\nIt is true that California wildfires are getting larger and that most of the state\u2019s largest wildfires have happened this century. The Mendocino Complex Fire, earlier this year, was the biggest California fire on record, as measured by acres burned.

The service is offered at more than 35 cities domestically, including at most major airports like Newark Liberty International Airport, O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Ms. Gibson said that the service had been frequently booked since it debuted in late September and that the company\u2019s net promoter score \u2014 a tool that the car rental industry uses to measure customer satisfaction \u2014 had increased.\n\nSilvercar by Audi had curbside drop-off at some of its airport locations when it started in 2012, but it expanded the service this summer to all 25 airports where it has rental centers, including Denver International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. Unlike Avis and Budget, which also charges $25 for a terminal drop-off, Silvercar doesn\u2019t tack on an extra cost for the perk. But rentals with Silvercar start at $59 a day, making it one of the costlier options in the industry. Mr. Abrams, the industry consultant, said the travelers most likely to use curbside drop-offs probably weren\u2019t price sensitive.\n\nAt some airports, like San Francisco International Airport, Silvercar customers do not have to go the company\u2019s rental center at all: They can leave their vehicle in the airport\u2019s short-term parking lot and lock it using Silvercar\u2019s app. They text Silvercar the location, and an employee picks up the car within an hour.\n\nChaz Brewer, a publicist from Los Angeles, said he appreciated that option on a late September work trip to Phoenix when he got lost on his way back to Silvercar\u2019s airport lot. Running out of time before his flight, he called the rental center in a panic and explained his situation.\n\n\u201cAn employee told me that it was no problem to leave the car in short-term parking, which turned out to be a lifesaver,\u201d he said. \u201cI just about made my flight.\u201d\n\nHertz and Fox Rent a Car do not have official drop-off programs at their airport locations.

The N.A.A.C.P. called the comments \u201csick\u201d after a video of the exchange was posted on Twitter over the weekend, while Mike Espy, Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s Democratic opponent, said, \u201cIt\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nMr. Espy, who is black, and Ms. Hyde-Smith, who is white, are locked in a runoff after no candidate in a four-person race received more than 50 percent of the vote on Election Day.

She explained to America why it was taking so long to count the ballots in Arizona\u2019s unresolved Senate race. Her explanation was thorough, sober, informative and nonpartisan. Most important, it helped foster confidence in the process. It wasn\u2019t just her. Arizona\u2019s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, tweeted over the weekend: \u201cLet\u2019s get this right. All legally cast votes must be counted.\u201d\n\nThese actions shouldn\u2019t be surprising, but they\u2019re in stark contrast to what we\u2019re seeing from those overseeing the close statewide races in Georgia and Florida. In Georgia, Brian Kemp, as secretary of state, used his office to accuse his opponents, without evidence, of hacking into the state election database; he posted this unfounded allegation on the same secretary of state website where voters go to check their polling location. In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott made similarly evidence-free allegations of electoral fraud and then ordered state law enforcement to investigate the county officials who oversee the vote count in two counties where his opponent performed well.\n\nWhat could be the reason for such opposite approaches?

If I was a young black man \u2014 let\u2019s say I\u2019m 21 and have a handgun license \u2014 me having a gun isn\u2019t exactly going to make that situation better. A police officer, if anything, is going to be more inclined to shoot me because I have a dangerous weapon, a lethal weapon, on me. I\u2019m not inclined to make anyone think I\u2019m dangerous. Some folks are just going to believe that I\u2019m either a problem or a criminal. I came to think that if that\u2019s the case, I shouldn\u2019t be armed. I should want to talk. If I can talk to that person, if I can give them a little of myself, and if I can get something of them, that fear can dissipate. There will always be tension, but I don\u2019t want to live in a world where I think I have to go through life defending myself with a firearm. I learned that during the course of the writing.

T.I. has grown up as I have, by which I mean his music is very Atlanta, making repeated reference to drugs and firearms. He\u2019s grown into being so socially aware and socially conscious, and has worked that into his music in a way that isn\u2019t off-putting, in songs like \u201cI Believe.\u201d Or even folks like Jason Isbell, to go in an entire different direction.

Vance\n\n18 hours, 38 minutes. Random House Audio.\n\nDuring the 2003 National Space Symposium, a scientific conference held three weeks after President George W. Bush initiated Operation Iraqi Freedom, signs of enthusiasm for the new war could be seen everywhere: in the weapons crowding the hall, in the CNN war coverage that filled the screens and in the applause that broke out every time the name of a weapon made by a company at the symposium was mentioned. This wasn\u2019t \u201ca bit of arms trading on the side,\u201d Neil deGrasse Tyson and Avis Lang write in \u201cAccessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military.\u201d Without the Space Symposium and \u201call its predecessors and counterparts across culture and time,\u201d Tyson realized, \u201cthere would be no astronomy, no astrophysics, no astronauts, no exploration of the solar system and barely any comprehension of the cosmos.\u201d\n\nThe book\u2019s first part, aptly titled \u201cSituational Awareness,\u201d chronicles an ancient legacy of cooperation between scientists and military personnel. It tracks the military uses of astronomers\u2019 tools, expertise and observational methods for navigation, reconnaissance and communication. It is a feast of history, an expert tour through thousands of years of war and conquest, on land and at sea, through more recent advances in warfare. From the celestial events that influenced battles in ancient Greece and China, to the indispensable telescopes of the American Civil War, the scientific and military spheres have never been all that separate. Even the founding fathers of astronomy were in dialogue with war makers; Ptolemy published military predictions based on his astronomical knowledge, Galileo secured the patronage of the doge in Venice by touting the military uses of his telescope and Kepler served as the astrologer for a prominent general during the Thirty Years\u2019 War.", "Stocks dropped on Monday, giving back a slice of their recent gains as investors dumped shares in some of the large technology companies that hold outsize sway over major market indexes.\n\nThe Nasdaq composite was one of the hardest-hit among the major benchmarks.

A first look at \u2018Toy Story 4\u2019", "Daniel Libeskind, the world-renowned master-plan architect for the reconstruction of the World Trade Center, first saw the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree as a teenager, in 1961, shortly after he had moved to New York from Poland \u2014 though the star was not at all memorable.\n\nNow, after two years of intensive design, Mr. Libeskind, the first architect to design a Swarovski star, has created a memorable piece : a 3-D, 900-pound architectural feat with 70 spikes and three million crystals with LED lighting spots that Mr. Libeskind said would emit rays so that the sculpture can be seen from all angles.\n\nWhen he first saw the tree as a boy, its crown, he said, was like a pin. \u201cThis is not a pin,\u201d he said of his own work. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a star.\u201d", "BERLIN \u2014 Horst Seehofer, the defiant German interior minister whose provocations have undermined Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government and eroded support for his own conservative party, said Monday that he would step down as head of the Christian Social Union, a key part of Ms. Merkel\u2019s governing coalition.\n\nMr. Seehofer\u2019s announcement that he plans to retire from party leadership, although he said he would remain in his more powerful government post, comes two weeks after Ms. Merkel shocked the country by announcing that she would do much the same thing. The Christian Social Union, which exists only in Bavaria, is the sister party to Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, who operate across the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the federal interior minister and will continue to exercise my duties,\u201d Mr. Seehofer said. His government job, he told reporters, \u201cis in no way affected\u201d by his decision.\n\nMr. Seehofer, 69, has recently faced calls to step down from his government post, and he has been under pressure within his own party since it suffered severe losses in a state election last month. He had hoped to rally conservatives around him, but instead earned a reputation for reckless political moves.", "Since the show\u2019s sensational premiere run Off Broadway at the Public Theater \u2014 Diana Ross is said to have sat in the aisle because there wasn\u2019t space anywhere else \u2014 Mr. Avian and Ms. Lee have been the keepers of this musical, originally conceived, directed and choreographed by Michael Bennett, who died of complications from AIDS in 1987. (The earworm-rich score is by Marvin Hamlisch, who died in 2012.)\n\nMr. Avian, credited as the musical\u2019s co-choreographer, and Ms. Lee, the original Connie Wong, travel the world to stage virtually every major production of \u201cA Chorus Line,\u201d passing on the steps to new casts and identifying dancers who might be able to do the same in the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big responsibility,\u201d Ms. Lee said.\n\nThis commitment \u2014 staging the musical exactly as Bennett designed it \u2014 has its detractors. When the most recent Broadway revival opened in 2006, Ben Brantley of The New York Times wrote that \u201cto have it return more or less exactly as it was makes it feel like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the Bennett estate took the rare step of allowing a new staging for the Stratford Festival in Canada. But re-creating the original has been de rigueur for decades, and Mr. Avian and Ms. Lee are most often called on to do it. They have worked together for 51 years \u2014 starting with another Bennett musical, \u201cHenry, Sweet Henry,\u201d in 1967 \u2014 and were early authorities on \u201cA Chorus Line.\u201d", "That was not long after Year One of turkey brining, or what many people refer to as 1999. That year, Alton Brown put forth a brine in his Food Network show \u201cGood Eats,\u201d and newspapers on both coasts suggested a fussy, sugar-salt brine developed at Chez Panisse to their readers for Thanksgiving.\n\nOne, seasoned with star anise and fennel seeds, came from the New York Times reporter R.W. Apple, who delivered a recipe for a turkey brined for 72 hours after he ate Thanksgiving dinner with the chef Alice Waters.\n\nThe other was in The San Francisco Chronicle, where staff members (including me) roasted nearly 30 turkeys and declared that the best way to prepare a bird was using a slightly shorter version of the Chez Panisse brine, flavored with four juniper berries, five crushed allspice berries and a head of garlic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially koshering,\u201d said Miriam Morgan, the food editor who oversaw the newspaper\u2019s project. Now retired, she will be brining again this year, as she has ever since that recipe was developed.\n\n\u201cThe reason I think it all started was because back then pretty much all we had were mass-produced turkey, which had no flavor, so you were trying to put more flavor and moisture back into the turkey,\u201d she said. \u201cThe turkey is delicious, so end of story.\u201d\n\nOther food editors quickly jumped on board. Ruth Reichl, formerly of The New York Times, Gourmet magazine and The Los Angeles Times, can\u2019t remember when she first advocated brining. She is not a fan of turkey, and has worked to forget all the ways she cajoled readers to prepare it; one unfortunate year, she suggested squishing the stuffing under the skin in a vain attempt to keep

"A year since its opening, the Louvre Abu Dhabi drew more than a million visitors to its dome-shaped museum that features borrowed treasures by Leonardo da Vinci and Vincent van Gogh from the collections of French institutions.\n\nThose visitors were dominated by foreign tourists, with more than 60 percent from other countries \u2014 topped by India, along with Germany, China, England, the United States and France, according to the new museum. The crowd figures are still small in comparison to the flagship Louvre in Paris, which is lending its brand through a 30-year government accord between the United Arab Emirates and France. The oil rich monarchy is paying 400 million euros (more than $453 million) for the name and almost a billion euros ($1.1 billion) for French expertise and guidance from the Louvre and a consortium of museums.\n\nEarlier this year, the Louvre \u2014 the world\u2019s largest art museum \u2014 reported a sharp increase in attendance, up more than 14 percent, to 8.1 million visitors. But in its debut year, the Middle Eastern namesake has already eclipsed the Louvre\u2019s satellite in a former coal mining district in northern France and institutions in its own region, such as Qatar\u2019s flagship Museum of Islamic Art, which attracted more than 400,000 visitors last year.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi museum is teaming again with the Louvre in February to mount an exhibition, \u201cRembrandt and the Dutch Golden Age,\u201d which starts Feb. 14. The show includes 17th century works on loan from Paris and from the private, New York-based Leiden collection, which owns more than 250 Dutch paintings and drawings and lent some earlier this year for special exhibitions in Russia at the Hermitage and the Pushkin State Museum.", "HARTFORD \u2014 Mark Twain was a well-traveled literary superstar, so famous that his editor once journeyed to Washington to ask President Theodore Roosevelt if he would move Thanksgiving because it coincided with Twain\u2019s birthday plans. (Twain moved his party.)\n\nBut in 1879, on a book tour through Europe, he craved the simplest foods from home, with agonizing specificity. Twain wanted Early Rose potatoes, a Vermont-bred heirloom, roasted in the ashes of a fire. Mussels from the waters around San Francisco. And hot broiled Virginia bacon.\n\nHe compiled a list, an extensive fantasy of a meal, which he imagined sitting down to enjoy right off the steamship when he got home. That list is now a snapshot of some of the most cherished regional American foods of his time.\n\nBut for a vast array of political, cultural and ecological reasons, few of Twain\u2019s picks \u2014 terrapin, prairie chicken and raccoon among them \u2014 would be considered an integral part of our national identity today. This month, the audiobook company Audible released an eight-episode series , hosted by the actor Nick Offerman, that explores the reasons.", "\u201cOther countries decline to pay for a drug when the price is too high,\u201d said Rachel Sachs, who studies drug pricing and regulation as an associate professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cThe United States has been unwilling to do this.\u201d\n\nFor example, except in rare cases, Britain will pay for new drugs only when their effectiveness is high relative to their prices. German regulators may decline to reimburse a new drug at rates higher than those paid for older therapies, if they find that it offers no additional benefit. Some other nations base their prices on those charged in Britain, Germany or other countries, Ms. Sachs added.\n\nThat, by and large, explains why we spend so much more on drugs in the United States than elsewhere. But what drove the change in the 1990s? One part of the explanation is that a record number of new drugs emerged in that decade.\n\nHuge sales for new and expensive drugs\n\nIn particular, sales of costly new hypertension and cancer drugs took off in the 1990s. The number of drugs with sales that topped $1 billion increased to 52 in 2006 from six in 1997. The combination of few price controls and rapid growth of brand-name drugs increased American per capita pharmaceutical spending.\n\n\u201cThe scientific explosion of the 1970s and 1980s that allowed us to isolate the genetic basis of certain diseases opened a lot of therapeutic areas for new drugs,\u201d said Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nHe pointed to other factors promoting the growth of drug spending in the 1990s, including increased advertising to physicians and consumers. Regulations on drug ads on TV were relaxed, which led to more advertising. More rapid F.D.A. approvals, fueled by new fees collected from pharmaceutical manufactures that began in 1992, also helped push new drugs to market.", "We reveal how one of the biggest fake news stories ever concocted \u2014 the 1984 AIDS-is-a-biological-weapon hoax \u2014 went viral in the pre-Internet era. Meet the KGB cons who invented it, and the \u201ctruth squad\u201d that quashed it. For a bit.", "Rio\u2019s mayor at the time, Eduardo Paes, wrote a letter complaining of my calumnies and took offense at talk of corruption. Another year passed, and Brazilian prosecutors found Olympic corruption everywhere. An executive from a big construction firm testified that he had given $5 million in bribes to Paes. The former mayor denies those charges.\n\nCalgary hired Ernst & Young to crunch its numbers. I sat in a council meeting as its sober gentlemen took us skipping through the numbers, all of which \u2014 miracle! \u2014 added up in favor of the bid.\n\nI nosed about afterward on the internet and noticed that Ernst & Young had served as a richly compensated \u201cexclusive provider\u201d to the Rio Olympics. Previous Olympic cities, Ernst & Young noted in a news release, had seen arenas turn into white elephants. Not Rio, no no. \u201cWe have established sustainable postgame use for facilities\u201d through a regimen of good governance and finance, the release said.\n\nTwo years later, Rio de Janeiro is stuck with a rumbling herd of white elephants, Olympic pools filled with rat feces, and a burned and collapsed velodrome and wrecked arenas. Officials have scrapped promises to turn Olympic handball courts into four public schools. As ESPN reported, the only one of the sports federations not found implicated in corruption was the Brazilian Confederation of Sports for the Visually Impaired.\n\nYou can only hope that Olympic and perhaps Ernst & Young officials had some fitful nights of sleep.\n\nThe I.O.C. has grown edgy at the lack of suitors seeking to host Games and proclaimed itself ready to shed the tux and don the hair shirt. It introduced a \u201cGames changer\u201d called the New Norm, which encourages construction of fewer new stadiums and would share more dollars with host cities.", "Q. I saw on the news that two rare Scottish wildcat kittens were rescued. How could the rescuers tell they were really wildcats?\n\nA. The biggest threat to the Scottish wildcat, Felis silvestris, is widespread interbreeding with feral domestic cats. The wildcats are endangered; just 45 to 100 purebred specimens remain, mostly roaming remote parts of Scotland\u2019s western Highlands.\n\nThe Royal Zoological Society of Scotland has developed a genetic test to distinguish wildcats from domestic cats and hybrids. But the elusive and fierce animals are seldom available for testing.\n\nResearch organizations like Wildcat Haven and Scottish Wildcat Action have developed what might be called a breed standard to identify wildcats, which may even help estimate the degree of hybridization in doubtful cases.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nThe male wildcat is bigger than the average house cat, although the females are about the same size. The wildcat\u2019s fur is much thicker, and its stripes are all solid black and brown; spots, broken stripes or white fur are indications of hybridization.", "The names were released as the authorities announced that 13 more bodies had been found, bringing the total dead in the Camp Fire up to 42. Ten of the 13 were found in Paradise, and the remaining three in Concow.\n\n\u201cThe numbers of losses of life are probably going to go much higher, I fear,\u201d said Jim Broshears, Paradise\u2019s emergency operations coordinator and the town\u2019s former fire chief.\n\nA concern over whether Paradise can rebuild\n\nWhile the Woolsey Fire chased residents from one of the wealthiest ZIP codes of California, near Malibu, the Camp Fire hit a low-income retirement community in Paradise. Some residents now wonder how \u2014 or if \u2014 it will be rebuilt.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt had no real economy,\u201d James Hana said of Paradise, where he has lived since 2002. The town was a haven for residents who were elderly or retired, many of them in mobile homes. A quarter of its residents were over 65, according to census data from 2017. Fourteen percent of the population was below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWhat are they going to do?\u201d Mr. Hana said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to rebuild.\u201d\n\nResidents say Paradise began as a mining and lumber town but those industries dried up long ago. The few people employed in town mostly work at local businesses, like restaurants and auto body shops. He makes roughly $25,000 a year as a handyman, he said, enough to get by in Paradise. The median value of a house in Paradise was around $250,000, less than half the California median of $544,000, according to Zillow, the real estate data company.\n\nMr. Hana sat outside the Neighborhood Church in Chico, a makeshift shelter for displaced residents, wearing donated pajama pants and running shoes.

Really, did we have to go that far?\u201d", "It is an unsettling coincidence that mass shootings bookended the 2018 election, from a Pittsburgh synagogue on Oct. 27 to a bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Nov. 7. The election that took place in between, though, demonstrated that Democrats and even some Republicans found gun-safety advocacy a boon to their campaigns in a way not seen in a long time. In comparison with previous elections, the gun-rights forces\u2019 customary blaring megaphone seemed nowhere near as loud as usual \u2014 or as effective. This is borne out by an examination of public attitudes, candidate positions, money and exposure.\n\nConsider first the public environment. According to Pew Research Center analysis, more Americans now favor gun regulation (52 percent) over gun rights (44 percent), a reversal from 2016. And 57 percent say gun laws should be stricter, compared with 52 percent in 2017. A recent Kaiser Foundation poll found gun policy to be the third most important concern of voters, behind health care and the economy. Similarly, Election Day exit polling found the same rank order, except that gun policy was bumped to fourth by immigration \u2014 a position it probably would not have lost but for President Trump\u2019s strenuous efforts to exploit immigration anxiety. An NBC News exit poll reported that 60 percent of voters favored stronger gun laws, including 42 percent of gun owners.\n\nCandidates embraced the gun-safety agenda this cycle to a degree not seen since at least the 2000 elections, when Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, made it key to his campaign messaging. According to Mark Kelly, who founded the gun-safety organization Americans for Responsible Solutions with his wife, the former House member Gabrielle Giffords, only four of 36 candidates listed on the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cred to blue\u201d list in 2016 included the gun issue in their platforms. (The \u201cred to blue\u201d list refers to Republican-held seats Democrats hope to gain.) This year, 38 of 59 candidates on the list included the issue. Candidates for Congress and other offices around the country aggressively touted their support for stronger gun measures, in races in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia and elsewhere. Consider it no coincidence that many of these states suffered recent mass shootings.\n\nMembers of Congress, including ambitious ones like Tim Ryan, the Ohio Democrat who ran against Nancy Pelosi to be party leader in 2016, and Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, both had A ratings from the National Rifle Association. But both reversed course, trading their A for an N.R.A. F after recent mass shootings. In Pennsylvania\u2019s First Congressional District, representing Bucks and Montgomery Counties, both the Democratic and Republican candidates for Congress advertised their support for stronger gun laws, leading gun-safety forces to split their endorsements between the two (Brian Fitzpatrick, the incumbent Republican, won narrowly).", "Bebe Buell, 65, singer, model.

Perhaps you\u2019ve finally saved enough to give yourself a running start. Your spouse and parents always tell you how great a cook you are. Every day you see another quote on social media about the need to seize the day.\n\nSo it\u2019s time to take the next step, right?

Think of that knowledge as a tailwind.", "Four years ago, in what became known as Gamergate, anonymous online miscreants harassed women in the video game industry, drawing worldwide outrage well before the #MeToo movement began. Today, 48 percent of gamers are women, and some \u2014 like Kim Se-yeon, known as Geguri, the first female gamer in the Overwatch League \u2014 make it to the pro level. But trolls pester female gamers with obscene, sexist and misogynistic language, without any consequences. In the world of gaming, there are no rules.\n\nThe most troubling aspect of this is that most games are intended for children and young adults. Approximately 64 million children in the United States play video games. We don\u2019t allow our children to watch things on television that contain this kind of language or behavior, and we certainly don\u2019t want them to think that the language and behavior of the trolls is acceptable.\n\nMy family moved to the United States two years ago from South Korea. My 3-year-old daughter loves learning English through YouTube videos and by playing puzzle video games. I fear that she\u2019ll be exposed to this toxicity soon, unless we eliminate trolls, put a new ratings system into place and demand better of the video-gaming industry. There are very real dangers to be feared: In June, a 7-year-old girl\u2019s avatar was sexually assaulted in a Roblox game.\n\nThe regulations and ratings systems now in place are not doing enough to stop the trolls. If an Elmo character shouts the F-word or kills his teammates in a game, it doesn\u2019t affect the game\u2019s rating, as provided by the industry\u2019s self-regulating organization, the Entertainment Software Rating Board. The E.S.R.B. reviews how violent and sexual game content is, but not how toxic the gamers are becoming in the games. The Federal Trade Commission says on its website that \u201cyou may be able to block the player, or notify a game\u2019s publisher or online service.\u201d While I\u2019ve blocked and reported hundreds of trolls to the video game companies, I\u2019ve never heard back.\n\nEven though this problem is widespread and many of the trolls live outside the United States, the F.T.C. and the rating board can take steps to make video game communities less toxic.\n\nFirst, they need to clearly define what is and is not acceptable in video games and streaming sites. Video games should be rated based on the amount of trolling that happens, and streaming sites should be rated just as video games are. Streaming channels should be dynamically filtered based on the user. Children under a certain age should not be able to see videos that use explicit language or sexual visuals.\n\nSecond, the F.T.C. should run extensive tests on video games and streaming sites to understand the toxicity and trolling of gaming communities. To do so, it can work with gamers across the country to collect data, as well as work with game companies and streaming sites.", "\u201cThe real assumption is that the operation will not be revealed,\u201d said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former national security adviser. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100 percent, but it can be estimated that 99 percent of these operations are not revealed, and 99 percent is good enough to make a decision assuming that the force will enter, execute and go out without being detected.\u201d\n\nThe cost of that tiny risk became evident on Monday and Tuesday. More than 400 rockets and mortar shells were fired into Israel, and the Israeli military said it had struck more than 100 military targets in Gaza belonging to Hamas, which governs the territory, and to Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israel\u2019s Iron Dome system intercepted more than 100 projectiles, it said.\n\nThe authorities in Gaza said five Palestinians had been killed in the Israeli airstrikes and 15 others wounded. On the Israeli side, one man was killed in Ashkelon \u2014 a Palestinian from Hebron, in the West Bank, according to local reports \u2014 and at least 16 people were wounded.\n\nEach side repeatedly warned the other to back down, but refused to do so itself. After Israel threatened Monday night to begin leveling Gaza high-rises, and then did, Hamas warned that \u201cmillions\u201d of Israelis would soon come under its rocket fire.\n\nIsrael\u2019s security cabinet was meeting on Tuesday, and officials said the government was spurning, for the moment, offers by Egypt and the United Nations to try to broker a cease-fire.\n\n\u201cFor the moment I think that we need to deal with the situation directly,\u201d said a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Emanuel Nachshon. \u201cIt\u2019s a security challenge, a security threat to the southern part of the state of Israel.

They don\u2019t want to be forced to go to a polling place; they want to be able to vote from home.

On Tuesday, Italy is expected to resubmit a largely unchanged and high-spending budget to the European Union, which is expected to reject it, for a second time, and begin the rare process of punishing a founding-member nation with penalties in the billions of euros.\n\nThe argument has haunted Europe since the financial crisis of 2008, of which the consequences, including uneven recoveries and persistent economic inequality, continue to ripple through southern Europe. Italy\u2019s populists came to power in part by blaming Brussels for stifling their economy with strict budget rules. The budget from Rome is the first real, and not just rhetorical, assault on the establishment order of the bloc.\n\nThe question is whether the budget is a serious stimulus plan or a bank-breaking populist giveaway larded with tax cuts, pension benefits and welfare programs that neither Italy nor the European Union can afford.

Ryan and Jared Smith, along with their father Scott, will collect more than $3 billion for their stake. That\u2019s against a lower valuation in an unpredictable stock market. The similar, if less impressive, company SurveyMonkey, which only went public in September, is trading below its I.P.O. price.\n\nRyan Smith, the chief executive of Qualtrics, will remain in charge, and the company will keep its brand and two headquarters in the United States.

It has produced positive free cash flow every year since its founding in 2002, according to I.P.O. filings. Not being a drain on resources makes it less likely that SAP will interfere.\n\nDespite the cloud of jargon, there\u2019s also visible scope for mutual benefit. SAP claims around 413,000 customers, while Qualtrics has a mere 9,000 or so. Revenue synergies can be questionable, but when a much smaller company\u2019s products \u2014 especially scalable cloud-based ones \u2014 can be inserted into the marketing channels of a far larger entity, top-line gains seem less far-fetched.\n\nAt 20 times the company\u2019s forecast revenue for 2018, SAP is paying up for Qualtrics, though control ought to merit a premium to second-class public-market shares. But SAP\u2019s Mr. McDermott sees XM as a new frontier for the operations-heavy group, and has breathlessly likened the deal to Facebook\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012.

The research has expanded over time to include not just art acquired by museums before or during the war, but also gifts that came later that have suspicious gaps in their provenance.\n\nThis year as part of the renewed research efforts, the Boijmans, now known as the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, supplemented its inventory process with a separate report by an independent historian, plus an exhibition, \u201cThe Boijmans in the War. Art in a Destroyed City,\u201d that discusses Mr. Hannema\u2019s role. The museum director\u2019s life is also the subject of a new biography by the Dutch art and cultural historian Wessel Krul, which was published last month.", "These ideas are popular with liberals, centrists and a good number of conservatives too. And progressive activists have come to understand that this issue needs to be one of their top priorities. If the quality of our democracy doesn\u2019t improve, many other policy priorities could be impossible to achieve.\n\nI think the United States finally has the pro-democracy movement that it needs \u2014 a movement not only to fight back against efforts by Republican leaders to make voting harder but also to go on the offensive. My column today is about that pro-democracy movement and what should come next for it.\n\nA couple of my own priorities are universal voting by mail and a voting age younger than 18. What democratic changes do you think are most important?

The initiative holds a narrow lead in the latest vote count, writes Ben Lockhart of The Deseret News.\n\nTwo other important outcomes would be losses of anti-voter officials in Arizona and North Carolina. And both may happen, Daniel Nichanian notes (here and here). Nichanian, a political scientist, wrote a voting-rights manifesto for Vox in 2016 that remains relevant.", "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Fluxus is fraught with contradiction. The interdisciplinary art movement, which emerged in the 1960s, is funny but serious; indefinite but authoritative; destructive but full of possibility.\n\nSo perhaps it is only fitting that Fluxus \u2014 for all its anti-bourgeois, anti-establishment, even anti-art swagger \u2014 is being celebrated here by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Getty Research Institute, institutions with the baggage of corporate sponsors, an aging clientele and the cultural canon.\n\nYet, with sensitive programming and musicality both rigorous and open-minded, the two organizations have assembled a convincing festival of Fluxus music for the Philharmonic\u2019s 100th-anniversary season. If Fluxus is about questioning the nature of art, then this festival is about an orchestra questioning the boundaries of performance as it reflects on the past century and looks ahead to the next.\n\n\u201cFluxus forces us to think about how and why we do what we do,\u201d said the composer and conductor Christopher Rountree, who organized the festival with Nancy Perloff of the Getty Research Institute.", "One of the most striking features of the new class is its litany of firsts.\n\nIlhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan are the first Muslim-American women ever elected to Congress; Ms. Omar, a state legislator, will also become the first Somali-American in the House. Like her predecessor, Keith Ellison, she has said she would likely be sworn in using a Quran.\n\nIn the suburbs of Kansas City, Sharice Davids, an openly gay woman and member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, toppled a Republican incumbent, Representative Kevin Yoder, to become one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress. The other is Deb Haaland of New Mexico, who will replace Michelle Lujan Grisham, just elected governor.\n\n\u201cWe have a record-breaking number of women of color going to Congress who will be sworn in in January,\u201d Ms. Haaland said in an interview. \u201cConsidering the fact that Native women have never had a voice in Congress for 240 years, it\u2019s significant that we have an opportunity to bring that voice to the table.\u201d\n\nAmong those women of color is Ayanna Pressley, who in 2009 became the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council. Then she stunned the Massachusetts political establishment when she beat Representative Michael Capuano in a primary earlier this year. Known for her fiery speaking style, she is, like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a darling of the progressive left, and she said in an interview that she is eager to bring her voice \u2014 and her passion for issues like overhauling the criminal justice system \u2014 to a Capitol that is still an overwhelmingly white male world.\n\n\u201cWashington is only a microcosm of society at large, and navigating these waters and terrain is not completely alien to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe corridors of power and most decision-making tables are dominated by white men. That was true when I was elected to the Boston City Council, and they enthusiastically embraced my agenda.\u201d\n\nThough no one is keeping records, Antonio Delgado of New York, a former Rhodes Scholar and Harvard-educated lawyer, is almost certainly the first rapper ever elected to Congress. His rap career was brief, but it did provide fodder for attacks from Republicans.\n\nThere are at least four people who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual in the new Democratic class; they include Angie Craig, a health care human resources official who ousted a Republican incumbent in the suburbs of St. Paul, Minn. She said she takes pride in being another first: the first lesbian mother in Congress. She and her wife have four sons.", "Good Monday. Want this by email?

But the strategy they followed is still the best strategy for Democrats to win: inspiring, mobilizing and turning out voters of color and progressive whites.\n\nI\u2019ve argued for this strategy for years. In my 2016 book, I analyzed Barack Obama\u2019s victories in the context of the country\u2019s changing demographics. The implications of the Gillum and Abrams races are profound (to be clear, I did fund-raising for the efforts to elect both Ms. Abrams and Mr. Gillum, just as I did for Mr. Obama in 2008), and learning the right lessons from 2018 is key for Democrats as they look ahead to the 2020 elections.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the best-performing Democratic candidates in statewide elections in Florida and Georgia have been Mr. Obama, Mr. Gillum and Ms. Abrams. (Hillary Clinton in 2016 was actually Florida\u2019s highest Democratic vote-getter ever.) This year, Ms. Abrams dramatically increased Democratic turnout, garnering more votes \u2014 1.9 million \u2014 than any other Democrat running for any office in the history of Georgia (and that includes Jimmy Carter, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton).\n\nConventional wisdom dictated that both Mr. Gillum and Ms. Abrams did not give Democrats their best chance; more traditional, moderate white candidates were seen as the most competitive.

On the same day, the justices will consider whether to hear two related cases, on whether Title VII bars discrimination based on sexual orientation. If the court agrees to hear any of the three cases, a relatively sleepy term will have gained its first blockbuster case.\n\nThe Trump administration filed a curious brief in Ms. Stephens\u2019s case, one that said two seemingly contradictory things. The appeals court had gotten things badly wrong on legal issues that were \u201crecurring and important,\u201d Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco told the justices. The ruling, he added, was \u201cinconsistent with decisions of other circuits.\u201d\n\nThose are precisely the things you say when you want to persuade the Supreme Court to hear a case. But Mr. Francisco went on to urge the court to deny review in the funeral home\u2019s appeal and instead hear one of the cases on whether Title VII bars discrimination based on what he called \u201canother non-biological-sex attribute \u2014 an individual\u2019s sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nIt is true that the appeals courts are more deeply divided on the question of whether Title VII covers discrimination against gay men and lesbians, with recent decisions from the Second Circuit, in New York, and the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, ruling that it does. It could make sense to decide that question first, and to defer a decision in Ms. Stephens\u2019s case in the meantime.\n\nBut Mr. Francisco went further, urging the Supreme Court to turn down the funeral home\u2019s appeal even if the court declined to hear the two sexual-orientation cases. That has court watchers puzzled.\n\nMr. Francisco\u2019s brief was nominally on behalf of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which had charged the funeral home with employment discrimination and had prevailed in the lower courts. But his legal arguments were at odds with the views the commission had taken in the case.\n\nMr. Francisco\u2019s brief abandoned the position that had been pressed by the commission in the Sixth Circuit and instead lent support to the funeral home. But in urging the Supreme Court to deny review, the commission remained formally aligned with Ms. Stephens, and the case is still known as R. G. & G. R. Harris Funeral Homes v.

Owned by the Carnegie Institution, the site currently hosts eight other telescopes as well as staff housing that evokes a Swiss chalet. During the night I spent there, I met scientists working on the GMT\u2019s instrumentation. One of them was Brian McLeod, astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Dr. McLeod leads a team developing instrumentation to keep the GMT\u2019s 14 primary and secondary mirrors correctly aligned. He started designing prototypes back in 2009, which means that at first light in 2024, he will have spent 15 years on this project. He ruefully noted that people change jobs more frequently than he changes projects.\n\nDr. McLeod traced his interest in astronomy back to high school in tiny Gambier, Ohio, when his chemistry teacher showed him the night sky through a telescope. I spoke with him in the control room of the Magellan Clay telescope at Las Campanas. He and his team were going to spend the entire night there testing their instruments. However, high wind speeds were spoiling their plans. When I saw them at breakfast the next day, they had spent the entire night in the control room and had only been able to use the telescope for a few hours at most.\n\nWhen it begins operations, the GMT will welcome visitors, but how exactly is still unclear, given the site\u2019s remoteness. Plus, nighttime observation requires dim ground conditions \u2014 a hazard to driving \u2014 while daytime is the period when all the observatory staff sleep. Still, if ALMA is any guide, visits to the GMT will be popular. So many people want to visit ALMA that the external relations staff stay on-site for weeks at a time, doing shift work.\n\nThis is despite the fact that unlike observatories for the general public, there is nothing to \u201csee\u201d at places like ALMA and the GMT. Today\u2019s professional facilities are long removed from the time when you look through a viewfinder and use the telescope as an extension of your eyeball. Instead, professional observatories use computers to capture data and images and send them to researchers around the world.\n\nNevertheless, visiting these observatories \u2014 like my previous visits to particle colliders \u2014 boggled my mind. After all, those who work at observatories operate time machines that can detect light emanating from the birth of our universe, billions of years in the past. Even with the naked eye, the light I saw from the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud was 200,000 years old.\n\nI said goodbye to Dr. McLeod and his team and boarded a plane back to Santiago. As I stared out the window, looking down at the vast brown carpet of the Atacama below me, I considered my situation with strange clarity: I was a collection of bound-together atoms surrounded by other atoms hammered into the shape of a metal airplane tube. And this tube was propelling me through the sky by burning the remains of long-dead plants and animals. Thoughts like this did not come naturally to me before visiting ALMA and Las Campanas.", "First, it came for eyeglasses. And then it came for makeup. It came for mattresses, and razors and erectile dysfunction pills. And now, finally, the Great Disruption has come for your cookware.\n\nUp until a few years ago, consumers faced a dizzying array of pots and pans on trips to department stores or online: cast iron skillets in a multitude of sizes, nonstick fry pans with lids and without, triply saut\u00e9 pans with different metallic exteriors, and stainless steel pots of varying volumes.\n\nBut with the emergence of several direct-to-consumer kitchenware companies, buyers can now eschew choice for curated, pared-down sets \u2014 just the essentials.\n\nGreat Jones, for example, which was started by Sierra Tishgart, 28, a former writer for New York magazine, and Maddy Moelis, 28, offers only five pieces : an enameled cast iron Dutch oven, a ceramic nonstick pan, a stockpot, a frying pan and a sauce pot. The Dutch oven, which they refer to as The Dutchess, costs $145 and comes in five millennial-matte colors (Blueberry, Broccoli, Earl Grey , Mustard and Macaron ) . The full set is $395.", "When a gunman slaughtered 11 worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue on a Shabbat morning last month, American Jews were left with a jumble of intense emotions: horror and fear, certainly, but also an old embattled feeling, centuries in the making. They were victims, in America, a country that has never seen even a hint of a pogrom. In their pain and worry, individual Jews had a rare chance to feel themselves part of a larger community \u2014 one that mourns together, gets angry together, imbued with a separate and unique identity, threatened yet resilient. And in this, victimhood offered an illusion.\n\nFor one thing, the violence of Pittsburgh is far from the everyday reality of American Jews. They live in a country that has offered them a great deal more love than it ever has hate. We\u2019re beyond mere tolerance. A recent Pew poll found that Americans felt \u201cwarmer\u201d about Jews than any other religious group. There is an accumulated sense of comfort and acceptance that has persisted even with a president whose winks have emboldened thousands of internet trolls and hundreds of white men bearing tiki torches. The positive side of the ledger remains plentiful.\n\nA shared sorrow may have provided the briefest taste of unity after Pittsburgh, but anti-Semitism is not what defines the experience of Jews in America today; assimilation is. To hear the professional worriers in the Jewish community, it\u2019s love, not hate, that poses the bigger existential challenge. A vast majority of Jews \u2014 72 percent among the non-Orthodox \u2014 now marry outside the tribe. The infrastructure of Judaism, from the synagogue to the long-established liberal denominations, is being steadily abandoned. Almost a third of millennial Jews are so unidentified with Judaism they say they have no religion at all. And Israel, which once inspired, now alienates many, especially the young. Even the massacre in Pittsburgh, for those who knew where to look, offered hints of this demise. The average age of the victims, those mainstays who turned on the lights and made sure the grape juice and cookies were set up for the kiddush, was 74. Three congregations gathered in one synagogue that morning because of dwindling numbers.\n\nOnce the candlelight vigils are over, where is the solid ground for the future of American Jewish identity? It won\u2019t come from being victims \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t \u2014 and cultural and ethnic identity, the bagels and lox version, is disappearing fast. From where then? As a handful of new books make abundantly clear, there really is only one source left: the religion \u2014 Judaism itself, and its unique capacity for adaptation.", "In recent years, Pitino was the focus of multiple scandals \u2014 such as the restaurant tryst, and allegations that a staff member paid for prostitutes to entertain recruits in on-campus housing. He also brought Louisville its third national championship, in 2013. As Petrino returned to the university, Jurich\u2019s game plan became clear.\n\nIt went roughly like this: As a former commuter college in an unfamiliar conference that has blue bloods in football (Clemson, Florida State, Virginia Tech) and basketball (Duke, North Carolina, Syracuse), Louisville could not afford to be squeamish when it came to the character of coaches who knew how to win.\n\nWhere other teams might not have rehired Petrino or retained Pitino, Louisville would \u2014 and would thereby benefit from their undeniable acumen as other programs would not.\n\nIt all blew up, starting a little more than a year ago. In summer 2017, the N.C.A.A. penalized Louisville for the prostitute scandal \u2014 of which Pitino had denied knowledge. It later formally revoked that 2013 national title, the only time it has vacated a Division I championship in its signature tournament, men\u2019s basketball.\n\nA few months later, Louisville was at the center of the suspected network of bribes and misconduct in college basketball recruiting brought forth by federal prosecutors. Pitino and Jurich were ousted in October 2017. (Last month, the father of a Louisville recruit testified that he received money not only from Adidas, Louisville\u2019s apparel sponsor, but also from Louisville\u2019s former associate head coach.)\n\nOn and off the football field, there were also early indications of trouble. The very night in December 2016 when Jackson won the Heisman, two players and a cheerleader were shot at a celebration. The Cardinals went on to lose their bowl game, making Jackson one of few modern Heisman winners whose team did not win at least 10 games.\n\nFootball attendance fell last season and this one, even as a $64 million expansion was completed at Cardinal Stadium \u2014 which had been known as Papa John\u2019s Cardinal Stadium before this summer, when the eponymous chief executive John Schnatter apologized for using a racial slur on a conference call and stepped down from the university\u2019s board of trustees.", "In March 1990, L. Ling-chi Wang got on a plane to Washington, where he felt that his words were being twisted.\n\nMr. Wang, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, had recently scored a victory when the school acknowledged it disproportionately hurt Asian-American applicants in its admissions, amid a wave of similar allegations of discrimination sweeping more than a dozen other universities.\n\nBut in Washington, Mr. Wang lobbied against a resolution introduced by a representative from California, Dana Rohrabacher, that called for the federal government to ramp up investigations into reports of such discrimination.\n\nWhat troubled Mr. Wang, a strong supporter of affirmative action, was that Mr. Rohrabacher was claiming that universities\u2019 policies helped underrepresented black and Hispanic students get in while, as the congressman put it, squeezing Asian-Americans out.", "Whenever Wagner Fischer drives, he notices the roadkill.\n\nAs a graduate student in the 1990s, Dr. Fischer, now a biologist with the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul, traveled through Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, a tropical wetland the size of Wisconsin, and the largest freshwater wetland in the world. From his motorcycle, he saw monkeys swinging from roadside trees; capybaras slept on the shoulder. He was looking for fishing bats, the subject of his graduate research. But he was fascinated and appalled by the roadside carnage: caimans, anacondas, giant black-necked storks called jabirus and, once, a dead giant anteater with her cub, still alive, clutching her back.\n\nThe region\u2019s main road, the BR-262, is a long thread of tarmac through the carpet of green, connecting the growing cities of Campo Grande and Corumb\u00e1, 430 miles apart. Dr. Fischer began taking photographs, thousands of them, and tallying the species along the road. He shared his unpublished results with other researchers and government officials.\n\n\u201cEveryone from the scientific community kept asking me, \u2018When are you going to publish that?\u2019\u201d Mr. Fischer recalled recently.\n\nTwo decades later, he finally has. His paper, published on Oct. 19 in the online biodiversity journal Check List, is a grim tally. From 1996 to 2000, Dr. Fischer counted dead 930 animals representing 29 reptile species and 47 bird species. A separate tally of mammals, to be published soon, includes more than 2,200 specimens. But even in its unpublished phase, his study inspired others like it, all of them confirming Dr. Fischer\u2019s initial conclusion: that for wildlife, BR-262 is the deadliest road in Brazil and one of the deadliest in the world.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s promise to quickly pass a revamped North American Free Trade Agreement has been upended by the midterm elections, with Democrats who will soon control the House vowing to withhold their support to extract greater protections for American workers.\n\nAdministration officials remain confident they will corral the votes for the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Mr. Trump speedily negotiated in September to claim a big win on one of his signature issues before the November elections.\n\nWhile White House officials considered pushing the revised deal through the coming lame-duck session, they did not want to risk a backlash from lawmakers in both parties.\n\nDemocrats, emboldened by their midterm win and eager to outshine Mr. Trump as defenders of the American worker, are unlikely to sign off on any deal that does not include significant changes that labor leaders and newly elected progressives are demanding. That could involve reopening negotiations with Mexico, although American and Mexican negotiators have both publicly ruled out that possibility.", "[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nUntil recently, the most important thing to know about Amazon for residents of the Queensbridge Houses, the country\u2019s largest public housing project, was that any packages left in a lobby would likely be stolen.\n\nBut Amazon will soon be a far larger presence in their New York City neighborhood.\n\nThe company owned by Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man, will announce on Tuesday that it will establish a major headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, where Queensbridge\u2019s 26 aging buildings are home to a mostly black and Hispanic population with a median household income of $15,843, well below the federal poverty line for a family of four.\n\nHere, where livings are eked out on meager paychecks, or social service assistance, with nearly 60 percent of its households relying on food stamps, the new neighbor will be one of the world\u2019s most profitable high-tech companies, bringing what could be a work force of 25,000 people making salaries upward of $100,000.\n\nThe stark contrast amplifies some of the social and economic tensions coursing through American society \u2014 a widening income gap, a lack of access to high-paying jobs for many minorities and a technology sector struggling to diversify.", "On dependability, officials in White Plains give the buses, which were made by Lion Electric, a Quebec-based company, a passing grade. \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d said Sergio Alfonso, the district\u2019s director of transportation. \u201cWe always expect issues with new technology, but we haven\u2019t seen anything out of the ordinary yet.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, in contrast, three school districts in Massachusetts bought three buses from Lion Electric under a state-funded pilot project. The buses had repeated battery and software failures, and parts often had to be shipped to Canada for repairs, putting the vehicles out of commission for lengthy spells.\n\nLion Electric says it has learned from those early missteps and is training mechanics in White Plains, as well as helping to establish a service center nearby in New Jersey for more serious problems.\n\nWhite Plains was only able to afford its five buses with outside help. National Express received a state grant that offset $120,000 of the cost of each vehicle. The company then set up a partnership with Consolidated Edison, the local electric utility, which agreed to chip in another $100,000 per bus.\n\nIn return, Con Ed gets the right to use the buses to help power the grid in the summer, when school is out and the vehicles sit idle. Their batteries would store electricity when demand is low and discharge it during peak hours.\n\nThe grid project is one of the first of its kind, and, in theory, could be a way for utilities to help finance electric school buses elsewhere in the state. As New York builds more solar and wind power, it will need lots of new energy storage. The utility plans to test the buses\u2019 batteries next summer to see how they hold up under heavy use and to check whether the economics work.", "Any time you crowd children \u2014 or adolescents, or young adults \u2014 together, there\u2019s an opportunity for some of the more contagious childhood diseases to take advantage of those who are susceptible. That was true in the First World War, where barrack life and troop ship transports contributed to the virulent spread of the 1918 influenza, which unlike most strains of flu, was more deadly to the healthy young than to the elderly.\n\nMany colleges require a specific list of immunizations before students move into dormitories, including meningococcal vaccine to prevent bacterial meningitis. But measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is always at the top of the list. That\u2019s because measles is so contagious that if the herd immunity \u2014 when a high percentage of a population is protected by immunization \u2014 drops even a few percentage points, the measles virus can take full advantage.\n\n\u201cThe first things you see, the cracks in your public health system,\u201d Dr. Ratner said, will be infections like this, \u201cmeasles, infectious through the respiratory route and good at moving from susceptible people to susceptible people.\u201d\n\nWhen my own daughter went off to college, someone looked carefully at her immunization records, always accepted without question at her school, and discovered that her very first MMR had been given a couple of months before her first birthday, and therefore didn\u2019t count; she had to go get one more dose before she took up residency in her dorm room.\n\nI had asked for that early MMR, because we were going to take her traveling in a country where there was still, at that time, a danger of measles exposure (no, not Brooklyn). You can give the MMR as early as 6 months if a child is at increased risk of measles exposure, and it provides some protection, but you have to repeat the shot after the child turns 1. I had forgotten to do that, and no one had ever noticed. As the pediatrician mother of the child with the incomplete vaccine record, I was a little embarrassed, but mostly impressed.\n\nDr. Stimson went on to note that those World War I soldiers who had grown up in more isolated, usually rural circumstances, were less likely to be immune to the childhood diseases, and \u201cwhen thousands of these rural young men are first massed together in army camps, contagious diseases are apt to be very common,\u201d he said. This had also been noted in the American Civil War, when measles was a particularly devastating disease, and the recruits coming off the farm were especially vulnerable.\n\nThe young men of 1918 were going into terrible danger (Dr. Stimson himself was wounded in action in Flanders, serving with the British troops) but they were also in danger because they were exposed to one another\u2019s viruses and bacteria.", "As my brother neared the end of a smooth, swift recovery from open-heart surgery to bypass an 80-percent blockage in his heart\u2019s most important artery recently, he reverted to a longstanding habit of downing many cups a day of strong coffee. I objected, but he insisted that the caffeine doesn\u2019t affect him, meaning it doesn\u2019t disturb his sleep.\n\nBut when I noticed how easily he became upset or angered by minor irritations many times a day, I decided to look into what is known about the bodily effects of so much caffeine and whether it might contribute to the harmful effects of stress on the heart.\n\nCaffeine is by far America\u2019s leading nonprescription drug, regularly consumed by some 90 million adults each day in coffee, tea, soft and energy drinks and some prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n\nAmounts can range widely. An 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee may contain 95 to 165 milligrams of caffeine, while a cup of instant coffee delivers 63 milligrams. One ounce of espresso has 47 to 64 milligrams; 8 ounces of brewed black tea, 25 to 48 milligrams; 8 ounces of brewed green tea, 25 to 29 milligrams; 8 ounces of cola, 24 to 46 milligrams, whereas a 12-ounce energy drink can contain as much as 300 milligrams.

The judge concluded that supervisors had not been alerted to any problem in the agent\u2019s background and had no reason to know that anything was amiss. But he allowed claims filed by the 14-year-old girl, now 18, whose ordeal had gone on well into the night \u2014 and might have been prevented if Mr. Manzanares\u2019s actions had been detected earlier \u2014 to proceed.\n\nThe case will drag out for months, however. Judge Crane suggested recently that he was prepared to allow appeals of some of his previous rulings to proceed before the case goes to trial.\n\nLawyers for the three women presented evidence that Mr. Manzanares\u2019s supervisors failed to notice or intervene when the agent ignored his duties for hours, and failed to thoroughly inspect his truck when he returned at the end of his shift. If they had, the evidence showed, they would have seen it contained used duct tape, blood and discarded restraints.\n\nMr. Manzanares, a father of two, had no major disciplinary infractions during his six years with the agency, which he joined in 2008 after serving with the United States Army in Afghanistan and working as a jailer for the Hidalgo County Sheriff\u2019s Department.

No imam of the Grand Mosque had ever anointed a Saudi ruler as the mujaddid of the age or dared to imply as much.\n\nThe sermons in Mecca and Medina are read from a script, which is approved beforehand by Saudi security forces. While the king appoints a leading imam for the Grand Mosque and the Prophet\u2019s Mosque in Medina, each imam has a number of officially appointed deputies who rotate in leading prayers and delivering sermons.\n\nFor decades, the sermons delivered in Mecca and Medina have been pietistic, dogmatic and predictable. They have always concluded with a prayer for the Saudi royals, but the imams would not attribute sacred qualities to the monarchy and insisted that the rulers should be obeyed only to the extent that they obey God.\n\nA lot has changed since Prince Mohammed\u2019s rise to power. The crown prince has imprisoned hundreds of prominent Saudi imams who have shown even a modicum of resistance \u2014 including very prominent and influential jurists such as Sheikh Saleh al-Talib and Sheikh Bandar Bin Aziz Bilila, former imams of the Grand Mosque. Saudi prosecutors have sought the death penalty for Salman al-Awdah, a prominent, reformist cleric who was arrested last September. Some reports claim that another prominent cleric, Sheikh Suleiman Daweesh, who was arrested in April 2016, has died in a Saudi prison after being tortured.\n\nThe only imams who seem to be allowed to lead prayers and give sermons at the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet\u2019s Mosque in Medina are those who have agreed to go along with whatever the crown prince wants. Some influential Saudi scholars such as Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Al Rayes went as far as saying in a lecture that even if the Saudi ruler \u201cfornicates in public on television for half an hour each day, you are still required to bring people together around the ruler, not to aggravate people against him.\u201d\n\nImam Sudais\u2019s recent sermon put Muslims at an axial turning point: Accept the crown prince as the divinely inspired reformer of Islam and believe and accept his words and deeds or you are an enemy of Islam.

Not only had Mr. McNamara never visited Europe, but the villagers, many of whom knew someone who had died at sea, had never considered their tallest waves swimmable, let alone surfable.", "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The Queensland police have arrested a former strawberry industry worker for spiking strawberries with needles, a crime that fueled a nationwide scare that crippled Australia\u2019s strawberry industry.\n\nThe woman, a former supervisor at a strawberry farm in Queensland, was arrested Sunday and has been charged with seven counts of contamination of goods. The police say there was a \u201ccircumstance of aggravation,\u201d meaning that if convicted, she faces up to 10 years in prison. The local news media identified her as My Ut Trinh, 50.\n\n\u201cThis has probably been one of the most trying investigations that I\u2019ve been a part of,\u201d Jon Wacker, a detective superintendent of the Drug and Serious Crime Group, said in a news conference on Monday.\n\nNews that fruit was being tampered with first broke in September, after several people reported discovering needles in strawberries they had purchased.

Another man from Queensland was less lucky: he was hospitalized after he swallowed half a needle while eating the fruit.", "Dad as the odd man out in baby-makes-three scenarios has long been a basis for domestic comedy. Reduced to synopses, much of the territory Mr. Birbiglia covers here sounds as wearily familiar as the \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d episodes that concerned the birth of Little Ricky.\n\nThis means (as my colleague Alexis Soloski pointed out when she reviewed this show Off Broadway) that Mr. Birbiglia is not a thoroughly modern dad, fully sharing the duties of parenthood. Mr. Birbiglia is quick to admit this dereliction and to praise his wife \u2014 and women in general \u2014 as belonging to a superior order of beings.\n\nMen, he contends, are born jerks, a universal truth that he believes accounts for the state of the world today. (\u201cThe men we used to think were great were priests, politicians and gymnastic doctors. It hasn\u2019t ended well for great.\u201d) He supports this contention with humiliating stories of his own bad behavior, including a graphically detailed account of sex with a prostitute in Amsterdam.\n\nHis status as male is only one of the reasons he once thought that he and his wife shouldn\u2019t have children. In the show\u2019s opening section, he lists seven arguments against his becoming a father. They range from assorted physical ailments (an early experience of cancer, diabetes and his tendency to act out his dreams while asleep) to his suspicion that \u201cconsciousness is only a hallucination.\u201d\n\nThe list in and of itself is not funny (although I did love the self-explanatory brevity of \u201cNo. 4: I have a cat\u201d). The conversational detours the list inspires can be sublime. That caveat about consciousness and hallucinations? It somehow segues into a description of the role of Roman Catholicism in Mr. Birbiglia\u2019s childhood as \u201cthis weird three-way with God\u201d and his mom.\n\nUnlikely similes and metaphors become a means of both addressing and (temporarily) defusing terrors and tensions. Presumably, verbal felicity is part of what brought Mr. Birbiglia and Ms. Stein together originally.", "But the show\u2019s ability to put critical distance between the way we see these supporting characters and the way they see themselves makes you wonder how it would frame some of these plot points if the heroes weren\u2019t Jamie and Claire. A white man takes up arms against a stifling government and then gives up on the idea of freeing slaves after learning there are laws against it. A white abolitionist woman stands for a dress-fitting as the slave Phaedre (Natalie Simpson) lavishes praise on her eyes, bosom and skin. Neither seems particularly comfortable, but neither have they discarded their fancy clothes, packed their bags and left.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting story to be told within this setup. This episode could examine how those who consider themselves good people can quickly become complicit in terrible things. We see it often in Jocasta, in Jamie, and there\u2019s a hint of it in Claire at that dress-fitting. The episode could, in classic period-piece style, use the past to ask questions about the structure of criminal law in the present. It could even ask us to evaluate how much sympathy we extend to protagonists \u2014 and who gets to be one. A version of this episode that followed Phaedre and Rufus (Jerome Holder) would likely give us a very different take on some of these events.\n\nBut despite Jamie and Claire\u2019s mistakes in the past \u2014 and questionable decisions here \u2014 \u201cOutlander\u201d doesn\u2019t want to cast too long a shadow over their essential heroism. Since they can\u2019t be aligned with the bad guys, they must be the good guys. In this episode, that\u2019s an uneasy perspective at best.\n\nNo one can expect them to turn the tide of an institution during a weekend visit. Claire and Ian\u2019s awkward party conversations prove just how entrenched so much of this cruelty is. The dissonance lies in the ways this episode seems less interested in examining the impact of slavery on slaves than on Jamie and Claire. When Jamie muses about growing rice, the episode doesn\u2019t suggest it\u2019s a slippery slope to contribute to the plantation \u2014 it\u2019s just his cleverness. When Claire finds out her attempts at heroism have backfired, the camera spends more time on her horror than on those she has put in danger.\n\nRufus, moreover, is injured enough \u2014 and the horrors that wait for him outside are savage enough \u2014 that giving him poison him can seem merciful, and not like a way to excuse Jamie and Claire for turning him over to the mob. Presumably they wouldn\u2019t have let him be brutalized, but we\u2019ll never know: This setup neatly spares them from having to make that choice. Even Rufus reassures Claire it\u2019s all right, dying gently amid bittersweet reminiscence. Holder does a great job with what he\u2019s given, but Claire and Jamie get almost as much time to mourn Rufus as he gets to be a person.", "Palm Beach County\u2019s elections supervisor, Susan Bucher, said that her county\u2019s machines are too old to conduct three full recounts as quickly as required, and the county would be unable to meet the deadline on Thursday.\n\nFlorida\u2019s protracted 2018 midterm election has revealed the warts of an imperfect voting system that normally go unnoticed. This time, the world is watching, and South Florida election officials are being exposed for sloppy processes that in some cases, a judge found this week, violated both state law and the Constitution.\n\nYet those very procedures are common during elections, political analysts in Florida say; they just don\u2019t get much attention most of the time because most elections end with wide enough margins of victory that few people scrutinize them.\n\nRepeated claims of mismanagement and worse by Mr. Scott and Mr. Rubio have drawn a backlash from Democrats, who said the governor\u2019s order to law enforcement to impound voting machines was inappropriate.\n\n\u201cIn suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,\u201d Juan Pe\u00f1alosa, the state Democratic Party director, said in a statement. \u201cThe governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.\u201d\n\nBut some number of irregularities do appear to have occurred.\n\nOn Sunday, one candidate filed an affidavit in court from a fired poll worker who claimed to have witnessed elections employees filling out ballots days before the 2016 election. It was unclear whether what the worker witnessed was wrongdoing, or a routine process in which staffers fill out fresh blank ballots to replace those that come in too bent, torn or otherwise defective to be read by machine. The affidavit was intended to prove that similar problems could be at work in the current election.\n\nIn Broward County, 22 rejected ballots were mixed in with about 180 valid ones and were counted. In Palm Beach County, damaged ballots that were duplicated by hand, as required under state law, were handled without independent observers having a good vantage point to witness the process.

The closing battle lines were more or less where they started, along the 38th Parallel. \u201cWe died for a tie,\u201d Korean War vets sometimes say, and there\u2019s something deeply unsatisfying about that narrative. We Americans understand military victory, and we\u2019ve come to understand loss, but we can\u2019t quite get our heads around a draw.\n\nThe men who bled and died in Korea are now taking their bows . They have certainly not forgotten Korea, and they are rightly proud of their accomplishments there. They stopped a naked act of Communist aggression and opposed three malevolent dictators \u2014 Stalin, Mao and Kim \u2014 while helping South Korea take wing as a democracy. Many Korean War veterans seem mystified that aside from endless reruns of \u201cMASH,\u201d their deeds have been given such short shrift in our national culture.\n\nA few months ago, I had the good fortune to visit South Korea with a large group of American veterans. The trip was part of a generous program, led by the South Korean government, to formally thank these now old men who helped save this tiny country from destruction and set it on the road to what it is now \u2014 a modern, technologically advanced society and a staunch American ally , with the world\u2019s 11th-largest economy.", "True, some pro-democracy changes are not realistic anytime soon. Trump and this Senate won\u2019t enact a new federal Voting Rights Act, nor will they grant the full rights of citizenship to the residents of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. But many other changes are feasible.\n\nAt the state level, a wave of new governors and legislators will soon take office, and they can accomplish a lot. States that don\u2019t have automatic voter registration should adopt it. (Hey, Governor Andrew Cuomo: Isn\u2019t New York supposed to be a progressive leader?) States that have not yet created nonpartisan offices to draw congressional districts should follow the examples of Colorado, Michigan and Missouri.\n\nIf governors and legislators won\u2019t act, citizen activists should, using ballot initiatives. Most of these measures will pass, in both blue states and red. Arizona, Florida and Ohio, among others, could hold initiatives to establish automatic registration, Stephen Wolf of Daily Kos has noted. Still other states could follow Florida\u2019s lead and re-enfranchise people with felony convictions.\n\nThis is also a moment to think ambitiously about a pro-democracy agenda. Any Democrat considering a 2020 run for president should be working on a democracy plan, much as any Democrat running in 2008 had a health care plan.\n\nMy own wish list includes universal voting by mail, which some parts of the West already use \u2014 and which lifts turnout much more than automatic voter registration alone. I would also like to see more places lower the voting age to 16 for local elections, as a few Maryland cities have.

Reach into the corner where you keep the shovel and the posthole digger and the pruning shears. From that jumble of wonderful tools requiring no gasoline, pull out a rake. Quite some time has elapsed since you last used the rake, and its tines may be a bit crooked now, bent here and there along the row. Never mind, the rake will do. Making do is part of the point.\n\nThink of how the rake reminds you of the comb your mother tugged gently through your clean hair after a bath.

He distinguished himself years later in the United States as a scholar in the field of behavioral psychology.\n\nDr. Salzinger, 89, and his wife were on their way to Macy\u2019s Herald Square on Oct. 27, when a hurried straphanger rushed past them on a subway platform in Penn Station, the police said. The man shoved the couple out of his path with an arm that knocked them both to the ground, Mr. Salzinger\u2019s family and the police said, before disappearing on a southbound 3 train headed to Brooklyn.\n\nStrangers rushed to help Dr. Salzinger, who was lying helpless on the platform. He was hospitalized with bleeding of the brain from the fall, and later contracted pneumonia, his relatives said. He died on Thursday.\n\nThe police and Mr. Salzinger\u2019s family believe his death was an accident, but they are awaiting an official determination from the medical examiner. The encounter was not captured on video, and the police have not yet located the straphanger to interview.", "THORNBURY, Ontario \u2014 Parents and grandparents jammed the small hall of Thornbury, a sleepy ski town north of Toronto, to glean tips on how to talk to their teenagers about the potential harms of marijuana.\n\nHeld less than a week before Canada was set to legalize cannabis, the public health session had a message for parents: Marijuana would be legal for adults, but it was not safe for young people. And parents needed to instill in their children the idea that pot could be dangerous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been proven the brain doesn\u2019t stop growing until you are 25, and yet we\u2019re legally selling it to people at 19,\u201d Jenny Hanley, an addictions counselor, said as she left the meeting. \u201cWhat the hell is our government thinking?\u201d\n\nCanada last month became the second country to make it legal for adults to buy, grow and consume small amounts of marijuana. But it also made it a crime to give it to anyone younger than 19 or 18, depending on the province, and set a penalty of up to 14 years in prison for doing so.", "The CNN chief Jeff Zucker gave his troops unexpected orders the day after President Trump snatched the press credential away from Jim Acosta, one of the network\u2019s White House correspondents.\n\nThe temptation to play it big was strong. Here was a CNN star in the middle of the action, and television news is nothing if not self-promotional. But at the regular morning meeting on Thursday, Mr. Zucker told his producers to stand down.\n\nThis time, CNN would not be led by the nose into giving significant airtime to another Trump attack on the news media, especially when Democrats were preparing to take over the House and Jeff Sessions was being forced out of the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nIt was a first step toward a revised approach in dealing with the president\u2019s anti-media antics, which reached a new level last week when Mr. Trump went beyond mere rhetoric by taking away Mr. Acosta\u2019s White House press pass and threatening to do the same for anyone else who failed to show \u201crespect.\u201d", "Peter Mulroy is loyal to the University of Notre Dame\u2019s football team, which won one for the Gipper in the 1920s and is undefeated this season as it practices for Saturday\u2019s game against Syracuse University at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe basement in Mr. Mulroy\u2019s house, on Staten Island, is a shrine to the team, with banners and photographs celebrating the Fighting Irish. He talks proudly about once high-fiving Rudy Ruettiger, the former Notre Dame walk-on famous for sacking a quarterback during the final seconds of the only game of his college career. Mr. Ruettiger\u2019s story was the basis of the 1993 movie \u201cRudy.\u201d\n\nIt is no coincidence that Mr. Mulroy\u2019s Shih Tzu is named Rudy.\n\nIt is no wonder that Mr. Mulroy\u2019s wife, Linda, says, \u201cI feel like my whole world revolves around Notre Dame.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Mulroy never graduated from Notre Dame. He did not even attend Notre Dame.\n\nMr. Mulroy, a retired New York City police detective, is what Notre Dame calls a \u201csubway alum,\u201d someone who roots for Notre Dame but does not have a Notre Dame diploma. The term \u201csubway alums\u201d was coined a century ago, when Notre Dame played some away games in New York. Now Notre Dame uses the term for people who aren\u2019t graduates of the school but are involved in alumni affairs nationally, including those in places that do not have subways.", "Numerous rivals, allies and underlings, along with cartel experts and law enforcement officers, are expected to recount how Mr. Guzm\u00e1n rose from a poor teenage laborer who got his start in crime by farming marijuana in rural Sinaloa to become the Al Capone of the international drug trade who Forbes magazine once placed on its annual list of billionaires.\n\nIt is a testament to the scope of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s operation that before his extradition he was already under indictment in six separate federal judicial districts, among them San Diego, Miami, Chicago and El Paso.\n\nThis trial will be held in Brooklyn on the orders of Loretta Lynch, the former United States attorney general who also once served as Brooklyn\u2019s top federal prosecutor.\n\nThe Brooklyn indictment, originally filed in 2009, stems from a series of obscure contract killings that occurred in New York in the early 1990s, according to three current and former law enforcement officials. Federal agents investigating the contract killings tied them to a Colombian trafficker from the Norte Valle drug cartel: Juan Carlos Ram\u00edrez Abad\u00eda, known as Chupeta, Spanish slang for Lollipop.\n\nDespite altering his face with plastic surgery, Mr. Ram\u00edrez was arrested in Brazil in 2007 (in the company of his bodybuilder lover) and was sent to Brooklyn where his case was handled by some of the same prosecutors who will be trying Mr. Guzm\u00e1n. Mr. Ram\u00edrez later became a government informant, helping the authorities prosecute Alfredo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva, one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s closest allies. Mr. Ram\u00edrez may also appear as a witness at the Guzm\u00e1n trial.\n\nIndeed, as part of their case, prosecutors are expected to present a thumbnail history of the Latin American drug trade and will show how Mr. Guzm\u00e1n worked hand in hand with the Colombian cartels throughout the 1990s. But within a decade, the government has said, the Colombians abandoned their American distribution routes as the country passed new extradition laws that put traffickers at risk for prosecution in the United States.", "Major oil producers meeting in Abu Dhabi on Sunday signaled that they were considering once again changing course and cutting production.\n\nBut the group, which included the Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, and his Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak, did not make any firm decisions. Those are more likely to come when officials gather in Vienna in the first week of December for a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nA statement after the meeting on Sunday, however, did warn that the gap between supply and demand could widen next year, which \u201cmay require new strategies to balance the market.\u201d\n\nThe producers at the meeting, from OPEC and non-OPEC nations, are clearly worried about the recent reversal of oil prices. After rising strongly this year on concerns about future supply shortages, oil prices have been sliding of late. Brent crude, the international benchmark, has fallen almost 20 percent to just over $70 a barrel from about $86 a barrel on Oct. 4. \u201cThe concerns have diametrically flipped,\u201d said Antoine Halff, a founding partner of Kayrros, a market research firm based in Paris.", "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 Leroy San\u00e9 took a touch, and flicked the ball to Raheem Sterling. Ashley Young, the Manchester United captain, tracked the pass. Sterling controlled the ball and slipped it back to San\u00e9. Young shuttled back the way he came. San\u00e9 waited until he arrived, and then rolled the ball to Phil Foden. Young set off again. Foden back to San\u00e9, San\u00e9 to Sterling, around and around, again and again, hypnotic and unstoppable and relentless.\n\nIn reality, the dance lasted for no more than a minute, but to Young, grasping at shadows, it must have felt much longer. Only at length did reinforcements arrive, Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Marouane Fellaini trotting over, eventually, to relieve their captain.\n\nBy then, they did so in forlorn hope. Manchester City was leading United, 3-1. The derby was lost. The fans at Etihad Stadium, their arms outstretched, their voices hoarse, were starting to sing. Anthony Taylor, the referee, had already drawn his whistle from his pocket.\n\nStill, S\u00e1nchez and Fellaini closed down Sterling: there are always appearances to keep up. Sterling shook his hips once, twice, his legs starting to twirl over the stationary ball. S\u00e1nchez heaved a huge, visible sigh. Fellaini looked a little angry, lunging at Sterling just as he darted away. He made contact enough to put an end to it all, though: The ball ran out for a corner.", "Jay O. Sanders is, by his own definition, \u201can oak tree\u201d \u2014 an imposing physical type associated with sturdiness, reliability and, on occasion, menace. And because Mr. Sanders has been a much-employed actor on stage and screen for some 40 years, he knows that oaks are rarely cast as the neurotic and cerebral title character of Chekhov\u2019s \u201cUncle Vanya.\u201d\n\n\u201cWally Shawn and Reed Birney would never be described as oaks,\u201d he said, referring to the 1994 Louis Malle film \u201cVanya on 42nd Street,\u201d starring Mr. Shawn, and Annie Baker\u2019s celebrated Off Broadway adaptation of 2012, starring Mr. Birney. In fact, until this year, Mr. Sanders \u2014 whose credits range from a whole lot of Shakespeare at the Public Theater to an assortment of bad and good guys on \u201cLaw and Order\u201d shows \u2014 had never appeared in a Chekhov play.\n\nBut for the past couple of months, eight times a week, the 65-year-old Mr. Sanders has been transforming himself into the emotionally fragile, perpetually thwarted Vanya with such devastating transparency that no one could dispute his right to play that part. Critics have called it the performance of his career and, in some cases, the best Vanya they have ever seen.\n\nSpeaking recently over a cappuccino in a Greenwich Village cafe, Mr. Sanders did not seem especially surprised by such a reception. In a sense, he has been preparing for Chekhov since 2010, when he first appeared in a production by Richard Nelson.

It really was like a secret society because unless you have a dog, you\u2019re probably not going to walk in there.\n\nDid you actually interview the dogs or just their owners?\n\nIt was really a little bit of both. Sometimes their owners try to speak for them. But then, if you\u2019re observing, you can see where the dog might disagree. We talked about, where do you want to go?

All were already taking a statin, and there's concern about the results because Vascepa was compared to mineral oil, which can interfere with statins, and may have made the comparison group fare worse. Still, some doctors said Vascepa's benefits seemed large enough to outweigh that worry.\n\nThe study that tested the lower amount of fish oil in the general population also tested vitamin D , one of the most popular supplements, and found it did not lower the risk of cancer or heart problems.", "To the Editor:\n\n\u201cA Hospital Die-Off Hits Rural America Hard\u201d (The Upshot, Oct. 30) encapsulated the continuing crisis.

MillerCoors, meanwhile, says it's not obligated to continue brewing for Pabst and that Pabst doesn't want to pay enough to justify doing so.\n\nThe trial in Milwaukee County Circuit Court begins Monday and is scheduled through Nov. 30.\n\nPabst's attorneys have said in court documents and hearings that MillerCoors LLC is lying about its brewing capacity to break away from Pabst and capture its share of the cheap beer market by disrupting Pabst's ability to compete. At a March hearing in which MillerCoors tried to have the lawsuit dismissed, Pabst attorney Adam Paris said \"stunning documents\" obtained from MillerCoors show that it went as far as hiring a consultant to \"figure out ways to get rid of us.\" MillerCoors has called that a mischaracterization of the consultant's work.\n\nThe 1999 agreement between MillerCoors and Pabst, which was founded in Milwaukee in 1844 but is now headquartered in Los Angeles, expires in 2020 but provides for two possible five-year extensions. The companies dispute how the extensions should be negotiated: MillerCoors argues that it has sole discretion to determine whether it can continue brewing for Pabst, whereas Pabst says the companies must work \"in good faith\" to find a solution if Pabst wants to extend the agreement but MillerCoors lacks the capacity.", "Good morning.

Democrats also could overhaul the state's approach to climate change, gun control and marijuana.\n\n\u2014 In Colorado, Democrats are planning a renewed push to expand health coverage, adopt gun controls, boost public education funding and enhance environmental protections.\n\n\u2014 In Maine, new Democratic Gov.-elect and Attorney General Janet Mills has vowed to finally expand Medicaid. Voters demanded that in a 2017 referendum, but the effort has been slowed by departing Republican Gov.

With the Legislature already controlled by Democrats, the state promptly tightened gun regulations, passed a paid sick-leave requirement and restored funding to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBut it hasn't been like Christmas every day for liberals. It took a last-day deal before the budget expired over the summer to avoid a state government shutdown as Democrats disagreed over which taxes to raise.

Two years ago, voters approved a ballot measure mandating panic buttons and instituting a system that would place guests accused of sexual misconduct on a blacklist, which would make hotel workers aware of their presence but not bar them.\n\nUnder the ordinance, if a hotel worker makes a sworn statement accusing a guest of sexual misconduct or if evidence supports the accusation, the guest would be barred from returning to that hotel for three years. If the worker makes the accusation without signing an affidavit, the guest\u2019s name will be added to the list for five years. If the worker agrees, the hotel should report the allegations to the police.\n\nIn late 2016, the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the main trade group representing major hotel chains, and other local trade organizations sued the city over the ordinance. The groups argued that requiring hotel management to bar and blacklist guests would violate guests\u2019 due-process rights.\n\n\u201cThat told us loud and clear that the industry was more concerned about their guests\u2019 comfort level than protecting their employees from sexual harassment,\u201d said Erik Van Rossum, the president of Unite Here\u2019s chapter in the Northwest, which covers Seattle and Portland, Ore.\n\nThe hotel and lodging association counters that workers\u2019 safety is a top priority.
