["After Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimony, Ms. Munro-Leighton contacted the Senate Judiciary Committee in October. She claimed she was the author of an anonymous handwritten letter signed \u201cJane Doe\u201d from Oceanside, Calif., alleging that Justice Kavanaugh and a friend \u201ctook turns raping me several times each\u201d in the back seat of a car, according to the committee\u2019s chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.\n\nUnder questioning by committee investigators last week, Mr. Grassley said, Ms. Munro-Leighton admitted she had never met Justice Kavanaugh and had not written the letter. She knew about it only because the committee had made it public and she claimed authorship because she \u201cjust wanted to get attention,\u201d Mr. Grassley quoted her saying. \u201cI was angry and I sent it out,\u201d she said of her email asserting she was Jane Doe, according to Mr. Grassley.\n\nMr. Grassley wrote Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the F.B.I. last week, referring the matter for possible investigation and prosecution for making false statements and obstruction. He has also asked the Justice Department to investigate another accuser, Julie Swetnick, and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, for possibly making false accusations.\n\nWhile Ms. Swetnick\u2019s allegations generated some attention, Ms. Munro-Leighton was never a major figure in the confirmation fight and had nothing to do with the main accusations raised by Dr. Blasey and, separately, by Deborah Ramirez, who said Justice Kavanaugh once exposed himself to her at a college party.\n\nMuch of the news media, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press, never mentioned Ms. Munro-Leighton before the confirmation vote.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Trump portrayed her reported recantation to his campaign audiences in the last few days as if that cleared up the whole matter.\n\n\u201cThe accuser of Brett Kavanaugh, a man who is a fine man, the accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her, she made up the story,\u201d Mr. Trump told the crowd in Cape Girardeau, in southeast Missouri. \u201cIt was false accusations, it was a scam, it was fake, it was all fake.\u201d\n\nThe audience booed.\n\n\u201cAnd you know,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhen that came about, people were calling for him to immediately get out. Think of that. Think if he would have done that, and then we found out that it was all false accusations. False statements. A made-up story.\u201d", "Is Amazon ready for the New York City subway?\n\nIn the neighborhood where the company reportedly wants to set up shop, the train routinely arrives full: cars packed so tightly with commuters rumbling into Long Island City from eastern Queens that waiting riders often have to watch several trains pass before they can get on.\n\nNow add up to 25,000 workers from Amazon.\n\nThe influx would strain New York\u2019s delay-plagued system, which reached a crisis point last year with constant disruptions, a series of derailments and on-time performance that still hovers around 68 percent. It would put particular pressure on the 7 line, which stretches from the West Side of Manhattan into Queens and is the main artery into Long Island City.\n\nYet Amazon is apparently undaunted. The company is nearing a deal to locate a major headquarters \u2014 one of two currently planned \u2014 in the sprawling, semi-industrial neighborhood, according to people briefed on the negotiations.\n\nThe precise location in Long Island City has yet to be announced, and it is not clear whether the headquarters would be a single building or several. The company could also change direction and choose a different site all together. One person with knowledge of the discussions said Amazon executives were referring to the New York location as a \u201ccampus.\u201d", "1.

In several smaller states, Ms. Pelosi predicted a Democratic sweep of the most competitive congressional races, including gains of two seats each in Iowa and Kansas, and one seat in New Mexico.\n\nThat supremely optimistic outlook on the night reflects just how high Democratic hopes have risen for a takeover in the House, and one person who attended the event expressed surprise at just how far Ms. Pelosi went in the direction of predicting a robust victory. Most leaders in both parties now expect Democrats to take the majority, but even confident Democratic officials have been largely restrained in forecasting the scale of gains they anticipate.\n\n[Read more about Nancy Pelosi on the campaign trail]\n\nStill, Ms. Pelosi urged Democrats not to take victory for granted even over the final hours of the campaign, and cautioned that they should not be surprised if Mr. Trump attempts to question the legitimacy of the election. She noted that Democrats have deployed hundreds of lawyers around the country to address any issues of election integrity.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly made baseless claims of voter fraud in the past, including in the aftermath of his own 2016 victory.\n\nLooking past an anticipated victory, Ms. Pelosi said a Democratic majority in the House would swiftly tackle issues of government ethics, infrastructure spending and health care.", "GOSHEN, N.Y. \u2014 Merlin Entertainments, the British entertainment company with attractions all over the globe, sees this bucolic town in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley as the perfect spot to build its most ambitious and expensive project: the world\u2019s largest Legoland theme park.\n\nThe 150-acre park, expected to open in 2020, will have eight themed areas and a 250-room hotel that will look as if it were constructed of Lego bricks.\n\nBehind their whimsical facades, amusement parks are a big and sometimes risky business. The cost of entry is often in the hundreds of millions of dollars and can reach a billion or more.\n\nAttendance at the top 10 parks grew 8.6 percent in 2017, according to a report from the Themed Entertainment Association.

There\u2019s a lot of world-building right up front, which means it can take a little while for readers to find their wings. It\u2019s worth it, though, as we meet Brysen, a young man smitten with his handsome hawk master, and his twin sister, Kylee, who has all the falcon-whispering skills Brysen lacks and desperately craves. Kylee hates her secret ability to speak the ancient language of birds \u2014 the Hollow Tongue \u2014 and wants only to escape.\n\nImage\n\nLondon conjures up a vivid world in which even the metaphors are bird-focused. Brysen\u2019s moods are \u201clike hummingbirds, fleeting and fast\u201d; Kylee\u2019s memory of their father\u2019s abuse \u201cpinned her in its talons, mantled its wings over her mind.\u201d We meet anti-bird-taming religious fanatics who crawl in the dirt, refusing to look at the sky, and \u201cbattle boys\u201d who fight for coins (\u201cbronze\u201d) in deep pits, wearing feathers and bone bracelets, covered in brilliantly colored tattoos (\u201cthey looked like a flock of bloodthirsty parrots\u201d). There are warriors on kites, ice snakes, a blood-birch forest. The vivid story has flashes of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cMad Max\u201d (the woman-powered remake, not the Mel Gibson original), but \u201cBlack Wings Beating\u201d is its own wondrous thing. London has a gift for depicting physicality \u2014 brutal fights, delicious food, muscled bodies. The heroes of his epic \u2014 there will clearly be a sequel \u2014 are a gay boy and a strong girl who needs to accept her own power. \u201cA falcon could mount to the stars and still count the hairs on a goat\u2019s head,\u201d Kylee muses. \u201cSo could a good imagination.\u201d Indeed.", "\u201cWe hope to effectively repeal Obamacare,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich will then give President Trump and Congress an opportunity to replace that failed experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans have better choices for health coverage at more affordable prices.\u201d (The suit argues that when the Republican tax law eliminated penalties for violating the A.C.A.\u2019s individual mandate to buy insurance, it ended the constitutional rationale by which the Supreme Court had approved the law \u2014 that it was based on Congress\u2019s right to tax.)\n\nAmong the Republican signatories to the lawsuit: Josh Hawley, the Missouri attorney general who challenged Claire McCaskill for her Senate seat while promising voters to protect coverage for pre-existing conditions; Republican officials from Wisconsin, where Gov. Scott Walker ran for re-election, and Georgia, where Secretary of State Brian Kemp ran for governor, making similar vows; and Pam Bondi, the Florida attorney general and close ally of Gov. Rick Scott, another Senate hopeful running ads saying pre-existing conditions should be covered.\n\nFiling a request in April for a preliminary injunction \u2014 as in, \u201cThis is an emergency, please rule as soon as possible\u201d \u2014 the plaintiffs were in a hurry to get the job done when they asked Judge O\u2019Connor to blow up Obamacare. They admonished him in their filing that \u201cthe sooner an order issues enjoining the A.C.A., the better, both so that all states and individuals can prepare to operate and live without the A.C.A.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time opponents of Obama-era policies have asked Judge O\u2019Connor to do their bidding. In 2016, they did it twice \u2014 first with a lawsuit challenging the legality of federal school guidance for accommodating transgender students and later with a suit calling for the invalidation of regulations applying the Affordable Care Act\u2019s various anti-discrimination provisions. Judge O\u2019Connor agreed that both of those cases required swift judicial intervention: After hearing oral arguments in each, he took nine and 11 days, respectively, to issue nationwide orders prohibiting the Obama administration from taking any further action that might cause what the law calls \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to the plaintiffs.\n\nJudge O\u2019Connor has expressed no urgency this time, on an issue that was central to the midterm campaigns.", "To the Editor:\n\nIt was incredibly heartening in this political climate to read \u201cNot Afraid to Claim an F From the N.R.A.\u201d (news article, Nov. 5).

The book becomes a record of obsessive love without any outlet, dead ends, yearning \u2014 themes central to Twombly, whose paintings are full of references to doomed lovers, Hero and Leander, Achilles and Patroclus. On one panel of \u201cCoronation of Sesostris,\u201d his epic painting in 10 parts, there is a scrawled line from Sappho that could apply to much of his work: \u201cEros, weaver of myth, Eros, sweet and bitter, Eros bringer of pain.\u201d\n\nRivkin travels in Twombly\u2019s footsteps.

But the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, ruled that Mr. Bucklew had not shown that his alternative would be less painful.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh seemed to express doubts about the requirement of identifying an alternative, at least where the usual method of execution coupled with an inmate\u2019s unusual medical condition could produce excruciating pain.", "And how do they fit on?\n\nWe don\u2019t use fixatives.

But four years later the ambitious young man was earning $4,200 as a radio sportscaster. The following year, as a contract Hollywood actor, he earned $13,000. Soon his success in the movies got him up to $143,000 a year.\n\nFrom his earliest days Ronald Reagan was a dreamer, and his dreams always seemed to come true. Yet throughout his life people scoffed at him. While conceding his Adonis-like countenance, mellifluous voice, quick tongue and sunny demeanor, they didn\u2019t see him as a man of mark. His ambitions seemed to outstrip his capacity.\n\nThis poses a mystery. How did this man thrive in so many highly competitive life pursuits, in radio, the movies, television, union leadership and the highest levels of politics? Bob Spitz seeks to answer that question in 761 pages of text in \u201cReagan: An American Journey.\u201d About 250 pages cover the Reagan presidency. Spitz traces here the full arc of the man\u2019s life and career, telling the story of how he leveraged his strengths of personality and clearheadedness to compensate for his weaknesses. Those weaknesses included an intellectual superficiality and a passion for political declamation \u2014 \u201cmagpie sermonizing,\u201d as Spitz calls it \u2014 that often rendered him boring to others, particularly his first wife, the actress Jane Wyman. The screenwriter Irving Wallace considered him \u201ca lovable scatterbrain \u2026 a man who parrots things \u2014 shallow and affable.\u201d Reagan, Spitz writes, \u201cwas not a man given to abstract thought.\u201d\n\nImage Jane Wyman and Ronald Reagan in a promotional photo. Credit Jack Albin/Ronald Reagan Presidential Library\n\nBut he also possessed a photographic memory, a lush imagination, an uncanny instinct for the right moment, highly developed communication skills and a passion for stardom. In high school and college he tasted a tiny slice of that stardom as a lifeguard at the swimming hole near his hometown, Dixon, Ill. A local newspaper reported that \u201cDutch\u201d Reagan, as he was known, made 71 rescues in the often swift currents of the Rock River. \u201cHe was everyone\u2019s hero,\u201d a schoolmate recalled. Spitz adds, demonstrating an occasional tendency toward extravagant prose, \u201cDutch was a magnet for gushing teenage beauties who mooned over his studly appeal.\u201d", "\u201cThe word \u2018headquarters\u2019 is a nontechnical, nonlegal term, but it plays well in the press to talk like this,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Kelley said. \u201cIt was a great P.R. move in all kinds of ways.\u201d\n\nQinghai Wang, a finance professor at the University of Central Florida who has studied corporate headquarters, agreed.\n\n\u201cCorporate headquarters, or at least the part that is central to decision-making, should be just in one place,\u201d he said. \u201cBoeing, another Seattle company that moved headquarters more than 10 years ago, only moved a few hundred people to Chicago. Amazon is a big company, and it has a very big headquarters already.\u201d\n\nAt least one expert realized some time ago how the game would end.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if later this year, Amazon announces that it\u2019s going to have more than one HQ2,\u201d the City Observatory, a think tank in Portland, Ore., said in an essay posted in January. One reason: \u201cIf a single winner is announced, and its competitors are dismissed, then Amazon\u2019s negotiating position becomes much weaker,\u201d the essay said. Having multiple winners, on the other hand, would allow the company to play one off the other.\n\nEven as the news sank in on Monday, some people rued the lost chance that Amazon would do something truly transformative \u2014 not just for the company, but for its new home.\n\n\u201cBig tech is at a pivotal moment, and Amazon is at the head of the class,\u201d said Scott Phillips, an entrepreneur who submitted a proposal to build an enormous city for Amazon in rural Oklahoma. \u201cIt is time for them to aggressively think not just about their bottom line but about ways they can do right by the world.\u201d", "GENEVA \u2014 China faced calls on Tuesday from Western government to end its mass detention of Uighur Muslims, but brusquely rebuffed the concerns as \u201cnot factual\u201d and \u201cpolitically driven.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is here to seek cooperation,\u201d said its vice foreign minister, Le Yucheng, at the opening of a review by the United Nations Human Rights Council.

"BERLIN \u2014 Germany\u2019s interior minister faced calls for his resignation on Tuesday, after his dismissal of a spy chief who had given fuel to right-wing and anti-immigrant sentiment failed to end a monthslong controversy that weakened the government.\n\nThe intelligence chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, became a hero to the growing far right in September, when he contradicted Chancellor Angela Merkel and questioned the validity of a video showing anti-immigrant protesters in the city of Chemnitz chasing people who appeared to be immigrants. At the time, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer \u2014 who has advocated a harder line on immigration than Ms. Merkel has \u2014 proposed moving Mr. Maassen to a position in his ministry, but resisted calls to fire him.\n\nBut it recently emerged that Mr. Maassen had blamed \u201cradical-left forces\u201d in the coalition government for plotting his demotion from the intelligence post he held for six years. He made that statement last month in a speech to a group of European colleagues, but it was only in the last few days that transcripts of his remarks appeared in the German news media.\n\nThe comments were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201ccrossed a line,\u201d and \u201cprecluded trusting cooperation,\u201d Mr. Seehofer said in announcing on Monday afternoon that Mr. Maassen would be dismissed from government service.", "Celebrities: Sometimes they are just like us.\n\nThe latest example was on Tuesday, when athletes, actors, musicians and those famous for being famous joined ordinary Americans to vote on Election Day. They waited in long lines, filled out ballots and shared \u201cI Voted\u201d photos \u2014 just like the rest of us.\n\nIn past years, midterm elections have typically drawn far less interest among all voters, including celebrities, and turnout at the polls has dipped in off-years between presidential elections.", "Ms. Jones brought her own babysitter, but there is now nature-focused arts programming, led by theater educators, for children while the parents work. The artists have adults-only lunches, but are joined by the children for family-style dinners, and at the end of the week, just as the artists present to their colleagues a sample of the work they have been developing, the children display their own handiwork. (The week I visited, the children were turning their clubhouse into a museum to exhibit their farm-inspired visual art, as well as practicing dance moves to \u201cLet It Go.\u201d)\n\nAmong the parents there this summer, working in a barn beside bales of hay and strings of drying garlic bulbs, were a married couple, the composer-lyricist C\u00e9sar Alvarez and the visual artist Emily Orling. They were starting work on a musical about motherhood inspired by Ms. Orling\u2019s own experience.\n\n\u201cI felt particularly trapped and shocked by the limitations of being a mother, and I endured a lot of that postpartum anxiety and depression,\u201d she said. The work, she said, will examine \u201cwhat is female; what does it mean to be a mother, and what does it mean to be creative.\u201d\n\n\u201cLifespan of a Fact\u201d tested a different proposition: that new parents could be accommodated by a commercial Broadway play hurtling toward opening night.\n\n\u201cI feel like I had to make a very conscious decision not to pursue having a family, and for my female colleagues who have made that other choice, I don\u2019t want them to be punished,\u201d Ms. Silverman said. \u201cI just tried to make it as easy as possible.\u201d\n\nSo she organized a phone call with the designers, and asked them for a wish list. The result: A dressing area was converted into a lactation room, with a lock, an outlet, a chair and a refrigerator so women could breast-pump. Another was set aside for a play space, so on especially grueling days the designers could bring their children, as well as someone to mind them, to the theater. The requests were made easier by the fact that the play has just a three-person cast, so there were rooms to spare backstage, and the producers readily agreed.", "Cheryl Strayed: I agree with Steve that if you want your boyfriend to change his ways, you must be direct with him. Tell him what you told us: you like him and you enjoy spending time with him, but his poor hygiene and his lack of general cleanliness make you think you might want to end the relationship. Your letter implies that you\u2019ve shared your feelings about these issues with him before and felt dismissed, but perhaps it was because your coolness, repression and deflection communicated something other than what you truly wanted to say. So try again, and do it more unambiguously and emphatically this time. There are changes we\u2019d like our partners to make because it would make us happier and there are changes we\u2019d like our partners to make because unless they do so we\u2019ll opt to end the relationship. It seems to me that this one is in the later category for you, Not His Hausfrau, so be clear with him about that. Doing so gives him the opportunity to either change or to tell you he\u2019s not willing to. Neglecting to be open in this way will only cause your resentment to grow, which will likely doom this relationship.\n\nSA: One thing I appreciate so much in your letter is your ability to recognize how this man was shaped by his marriage. It\u2019s also worth considering how your marriage shaped you. I say this because I was quite struck by your declaration that you repress and deflect emotion, and seldom tell this man \u201canything about myself.\u201d Is this reluctance a vestige of your marriage? Is it something you\u2019re willing to work on? Because intimacy is a two-way street, Not His Hausfrau. It\u2019s impossible to achieve unless both parties trust each other enough to share the contents of their heart. Perhaps you\u2019re afraid of being disappointed by this man. Or maybe you\u2019re simply not interested enough to take such a risk. Saying \u201che means well\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a passionate endorsement. The most important point here is that you deserve a romantic relationship where you can express your true feelings, whether those feelings are desire or frustration \u2014 a relationship that inspires you to share who you are, not hide it away. That kind of reward only comes when you\u2019re willing to risk your own vulnerability.\n\nCS: You say your boyfriend feigns helplessness about seeing to his hygiene and cleanliness, but perhaps it\u2019s not all an act. When you speak to him about your concerns \u2014 with vulnerability and honesty \u2014 I hope you\u2019ll also do so with compassion. I don\u2019t need to tell you that many men of your generation (and let\u2019s face it, mine) were not required to see to things like spots on clothes and crumbs in cars, especially if they spent their lives in the company of women who did that for them (and for their fathers and grandfathers, too). I don\u2019t offer this as an excuse, but rather an explanation. Perhaps your boyfriend hasn\u2019t addressed your concerns because he doesn\u2019t know how to perform some of the requisite tasks. If you learn he\u2019s sincerely motivated to change, and if you really do want to keep him in your life, you might consider offering a tutorial on the domestic and sartorial arts. It\u2019s true you are neither his mother nor his hausfrau, but as his girlfriend you could offer guidance without becoming responsible for seeing to them. Plus, you might even find a bit of fun in the undertaking. After all, nobody ever said the only thing that had to get done in the laundry room was the laundry.", "\u201cI don\u2019t care if I lose clients,\u201d said Lynne Jones, an interior designer raised in burning-red Paducah, Tex., wedging a stack of Beto O\u2019Rourke signs into her car over the summer, part of what she described as the most serious political engagement of her 62 years. \u201cPolitics is a dirty business, I\u2019m discovering.\u201d\n\nThe right speaks with gratitude for a White House dream realized.\n\n\u201cWe believe he\u2019s sent from God,\u201d Kathy Kiely, 67, said of Mr. Trump from a mall food court in Prescott, Ariz., \u201cto bring us back to where we used to be, and where we can be.\u201d\n\nMore common, though, are the darker appraisals: of enemies real and imagined, of what awaits us if the national rupture remains.\n\n\u201cHistory always repeats itself,\u201d said Robert Brock, 42, a Trump-supporting truck driver in South Daytona, Fla., forecasting a kind of modern civil war between conservative and liberal. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t realizing that.\u201d\n\nIn flashes, the race\u2019s final weeks have lurched from abstract menace to notes of genuine violence. Mail bombs targeted Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents. The president praised and re-enacted a congressman\u2019s assault on a reporter, to cheers and laughter inside a Montana airplane hangar. He suggested that the military should fire upon migrant rock-throwers at the southern border.\n\nAnd inside the Volusia County Republican office, where Mr. Brock spoke of looming combat after a rally for the statewide ticket, gunshots had shattered a front window last week, piercing a poster with the president\u2019s surname. By the weekend, the sign was up again, with a hole visible just above the \u201cR\u201d \u2014 a message to whoever had done this, to whoever doubts the tenacity of the president\u2019s people.", "BAGHDAD \u2014 Over 200 mass graves holding as many as 12,000 bodies have been found in areas of Iraq once controlled by the Islamic State, the United Nations said on Tuesday. The findings were highlighted in a joint report released by the United Nations mission to Iraq and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which called the sites a \u201clegacy of terror.\u201d\n\nWhere are the graves, and what are they like?\n\nMost are in the four provinces of northern and western Iraq where the Islamic State\u2019s so-called caliphate acted as the government: Anbar, Kirkuk, Salahuddin and Nineveh, which includes Mosul, the largest city once controlled by the extremists. They range from small burial sites with eight bodies, to massive pits believed to hold thousands. The biggest is believed to be the Khasfa Sinkhole near Mosul.\n\n\u201cI can only say that the number of the victims of the mass graves is much bigger than the numbers in the report,\u201d said Dhia Kareem, head of the Mass Graves Directorate in Iraq. He said eyewitnesses estimated there were 6,000 bodies in the Khasfa Sinkhole.\n\n\u201cISIL\u2019s horrific crimes in Iraq have left the headlines, but the trauma of the victims\u2019 families endures, with thousands of women, men and children still unaccounted for,\u201d Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations human rights commissioner, said, referring to the Islamic State. \u201cThese graves contain the remains of those mercilessly killed for not conforming to ISIL\u2019s twisted ideology and rule.\u201d", "Since the 2016 United States presidential election, which Russian operatives influenced through a coordinated campaign of disinformation on social media, platforms like Twitter and Facebook have taken steps to address the problem. Thousands of \u201csock puppet\u201d personas with hundreds of thousands of followers have been taken down on Facebook, for example, and cannot easily be rebuilt. Twitter has reduced the risk that propaganda is spread through automated accounts, or bots.\n\nSuch efforts may be helping. The consensus among researchers monitoring the 2018 midterm elections is that there has been less of the specific sort of interference the Russians engaged in two years ago, when they attempted to aggravate social tensions in the United States and foster distrust of our democratic institutions.\n\nBut an analysis by Kris Shaffer, a senior analyst for our cybersecurity company, suggests that while these measures may have rendered some of the Russian tactics of 2016 less effective, they haven\u2019t fully stopped Russian influence operations. In many instances, they seem to have merely caused Russia to shift or develop new tactics.\n\nIndeed, our company is currently detecting more overall activity in real time from continuing Russian online influence operations targeting the midterm elections than has been disclosed by social media platforms or detected by researchers during the same period before the election in 2016.", "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.\n\n__________\n\nPresident Xi Jinping of China is opening up Shanghai to the world of technology public offerings.\n\nMr. Xi said that a new science and innovation equity bourse in the city would be used to host tech companies. It is supposed to test a new listing system, where companies would simply register their intention to conduct an initial public offering, as in the United States, instead of seeking regulatory approval.\n\nIt is an overdue reform, but officials may rue the volatility that it will probably bring.\n\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange, with a market capitalization of over $4 trillion, aimed to become an international venue equivalent to New York\u2019s Nasdaq by 2020. But that goal has been quietly abandoned. It struggles to compete with the Shenzhen bourse, which attracts start-ups to its ChiNext market. Hong Kong, too, increasingly woos the likes of Xiaomi.\n\nShanghai, meanwhile, is an overweight state-owned dinosaur. But after years of lobbying Beijing for help attracting tech outfits, it finally got its wish.", "Mr. Tuttolomondo does not fetishize the past. Perhaps this is because he lived it. For almost 60 years his family has owned a series of old-school slice joints in the neighborhood. The current incarnation is literally on a street corner, at the intersection of 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It is called Mama\u2019s Pizza. He didn\u2019t open Mama\u2019s Too a block away to outdo his parents; he\u2019s bringing their product into a new era. If the neoclassicists are like the folk revivalists who collected old acoustic 78s, he is Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.\n\nWhen Mama\u2019s Too opened in December, it also served housemade pasta. It\u2019s still on the menu board that hangs on one wall, but Mr. Tuttolomondo has stopped serving it to concentrate on pizza. Besides the house slice, he also makes squares that he sees as a marriage of rectangular Sicilian pizza with Roman pizza al taglio. The crust is much taller than the Roman style, and taller than some Sicilians, too, but it is airy and chewy. On the bottom it has the bronze color, the cratered surface and the pan-fried crunch of the bread on a grilled cheese sandwich. The edges, where the dough meets the pan, have a gold fringe of browned cheese, known among students of pizza styles as a \u201cfrico crust.\u201d This fringe is, of course, crunchy and delicious.\n\nThe most impressive square is, I think, the pepperoni. Unlike most of the others, it incorporates tomato sauce. The mozzarella is baked until it begins to brown. The pepperoni slices are small and concave, like contact lenses made of meat. Crunchy around the rims, these little cups are half-filled with spicy red oil.\n\nIt may sound as if I approached this slice with cool, analytical detachment. The truth is I ripped into it like a pack of hyenas.\n\nThe other squares tend to be white pies with toppings. Again, tomato sauce is one of the toppings. In one case it\u2019s a thick and creamy layer of vodka sauce, one of the ideas that separates Mama\u2019s Too from the neoclassicists. Mr. Tuttolomondo also makes a cacio e pepe Sicilian pie, essentially a four-cheese pizza in which one of the cheeses is pecorino; the whole slice hums with black pepper. The square topped with Gorgonzola dolce and pears works in a way that combination often doesn\u2019t, although half a slice was enough for me.\n\nThe shop is small, and if you sit at one of the handful of red counter stools you will share the small tiled floor up front with neighbors waiting for takeout and delivery guys. There are no vintage soda refrigerators or letterboard signs, but there is a small photograph of Robert De Niro eating pizza and a much bigger one of John Travolta in \u201cSaturday Night Fever,\u201d biting into his double-decker slice. The picture is in black and white except for the pizza. Tinted orange and red, it glows like a beacon.", "ISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has kept the case of Jamal Khashoggi alive through a steady drip of leaks, forcing the Saudis to admit that the columnist and dissident was killed more than a month ago in their consulate in Istanbul.\n\nBut for Mr. Erdogan, the case has always been broader than journalistic freedom or human rights abuses. And, in fact, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s use of the case in the name of justice has left many deeply conflicted in Turkey, a country where tens of thousands of citizens have been caught up in a government crackdown since a coup attempt in 2016.\n\nThe tactics Mr. Erdogan has used against the Saudis are much the same ones he has perfected against political enemies at home \u2014 leaks planted by government sources and reported by friendly news outlets, which he then cites to destroy his opponents.\n\nThat approach has become a staple of the president\u2019s arsenal to spread intimidation and to crack down on dissent. He has been able to employ it so effectively, including against the Saudis, partly because of a compliant news media that he has fashioned over 16 years in power.", "The first major New York survey of Ms. Rosler\u2019s art in 18 years has opened at the Jewish Museum, and runs through March 3.

Her exhibitions have focused on tenant struggles and homelessness; the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; public space; and \u2014 very often \u2014 the experiences of women.

Well, if you look back at U.S. Mideast policy over the last decade, what do you see? You see the Obama team looking at Iran and Saudi Arabia and saying: The Saudis are drifting and will never deliver on Arab-Israel peace or real reform at home, so let\u2019s bet on Iran \u2014 let\u2019s bet that the best way to tilt the region onto a better path is by promoting denuclearization and reform in Iran, which is a real civilization, with empowered women and a pro-Western middle class.\n\nSo, the Obama team forged the Iran nuclear deal, which curbed Iran\u2019s development of nuclear weapons for at least 15 years, in return for a lifting of U.S. sanctions \u2014 and with the hoped-for byproduct of opening Iran up to the world, thereby strengthening moderates there against the hard-line Revolutionary Guards.", "Runoff rules have now been adopted by 75 percent of Latin American countries. Cynthia McClintock\u2019s research shows the moderating effects of runoff rules. With a few exceptions, and Brazil\u2019s recent election was one, illiberal presidents seldom manage to emerge from runoff elections. The beauty of second rounds is that they force contenders to bargain with other groups, often moderates, as just happened in Colombia this year. So electoral coalitions are less extreme.\n\nOn the exit side, a key barrier has been term limits. They were popularized by Latin America in the 19th century, long before the United States adopted the rule in 1951 with the 22nd amendment. Despite a recent weakening of term limits in Latin America, they still work. Mexico, for instance, with strict term limits since the early 20th century, has not had a classic dictator since. Most Latin American presidents respect term limits, and those who try to circumvent them usually face an uphill battle.\n\nAnother key lesson from Latin America is the importance of enhancing the autonomy of courts and social movements \u2014 important checks on illiberal presidents. Courts have the legal power to stop illiberal measures, and social movements can block them via resistance.\n\nEnsuring that courts and movements remain detached from presidential influence is therefore vital, and Latin America has improved its scores on both fronts. A new book documents how Latin American countries for the most part have made the process of selecting judges more pluralistic, which makes it less dependent on the president.\n\nLikewise, where social movements have resisted the temptation to be co-opted by presidents, illiberal presidents face barriers. In Ecuador, for instance, one of the most effective checks on the illiberal designs of former President Rafael Correa was the advocacy and resistance stemming from feminist, indigenous and environmental groups that refused to be folded into Mr. Correa\u2019s ruling party.\n\nA third lesson from Latin America is information maximization. Almost every Latin American country has expanded the number of watchdogs, or as they are often called, observatories. The obsession with observation started with electoral observation in the 1980s, but now covers a variety of public concerns: homicides, police activity, government-business relations, social policy, gender and sexuality. Argentina has even developed observatories of government economists, so that when the populist president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez instructed her officials to doctor economic figures, everyone found out about it.\n\nFinally, some Latin American countries have taken to heart the very liberal principle that in a democracy, the winner shouldn\u2019t win that much, and the loser shouldn\u2019t lose that much. The most obvious example involves gender.", "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 In September, a billboard appeared near downtown here urging voters to support Proposition 2, an initiative to legalize medical marijuana that is on the ballot Tuesday. Quoting from Mormon Church scripture and its \u201cword of wisdom\u201d about food and drink, the billboard read, \u201cAll Wholesome Herbs God Has Ordained for the Use of Man.\u201d In other words, you can use pot for your medical ills and still be a good Mormon.\n\nBut will Mormons listen?\n\nThe debate over marijuana highlights an emerging dynamic in this fast-growing Western state. It pits Utah\u2019s conservative political establishment, centered on the Republican Party and the Mormon Church, against a growing population of younger, less religious, more ethnically diverse and politically liberal residents. Indeed, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has been increasingly forced to find common ground with these voters. And medical marijuana may be just the latest example of this shift.\n\nOver the last three decades Utah has been a one-party state. All of its current federal office holders are Republicans. But when Donald Trump won the state in 2016, it was not with a majority: He took 46 percent of the vote, with Hillary Clinton receiving 27 percent and an independent candidate, Evan McMullin, getting almost 22 percent. According to one nationwide polling group, the drop in Mr. Trump\u2019s approval since inauguration has been the greatest in Utah. The state\u2019s generally polite churchgoing culture seems uncomfortable with the president\u2019s pettiness, self-absorption, vulgarities and vanity.\n\nAbout 60 percent of Utah residents describe themselves as Mormon, a significant number of them nonpracticing. But in Salt Lake City, a majority of the population does not identify as Mormon. The city\u2019s L.G.B.T. population is vocal and visible. Utah\u2019s Latino population has increased in recent years to 13 percent, and the state has long welcomed refugees from around the world. It is worth recalling that the 19th-century Mormon trek west stemmed from government persecution, and that since then, the church has had an extensive missionary program that has brought immigrants from across the globe here.", "The \u201chouse slice\u201d at Mama\u2019s Too, a new pizzeria on the Upper West Side, is made by spooning tomatoes over the cheese, a reversal of the usual order.

In Texas, a judge ordered nine polling locations in Harris County to remain open an extra hour after civil rights organizations complained. A coalition of groups was seeking the same in Maricopa County, Ariz. And, in Georgia, a local judge kept several sites in Gwinnett County open, including the Annistown Elementary School, where voting was extended by more than two hours.\n\nA handful of precincts were also held open for several hours in Fulton County, which includes much of Atlanta.

The creative offerings of Asian-Americans \u2014 from Vera Wang\u2019s fantasy wedding dresses to the fiction of Jhumpa Lahiri to the haunting cinematography of Hiro Murai, the director of Donald Glover\u2019s television show \u201cAtlanta\u201d \u2014 aren\u2019t just accepted but celebrated. Only in the representational arts do Asians remain unseen \u2014 mostly in film and television, but in music, too, and, to a lesser degree, on the runway.\n\nIn other words: It is only when we are hidden that we are allowed to succeed. Which leads to a more troubling but inevitable conclusion: that there is something about the very physiognomy of the Asian face that American audiences still cannot or will not accept.\n\nEXOTIC, OPPORTUNISTIC prostitutes. Sexless, emasculated eunuchs. Submissive young girls. Savage, untamed creatures. Coolies. Filth. The earliest stereotypes about Asian-Americans were formed after the first wave of immigration in the mid-1800s, when Chinese immigrants were brought in by the thousands to help build the railroads that would eventually crisscross the western half of the nation. They were cheaper than American and European laborers, and they were made to work longer hours. But they were also hired because they were willing (though did they really have a choice?) to do the more dangerous work \u2014 clearing the path along perilous mountain ridges with dynamite, blowing up granite rock to create tunnels, often getting trapped inside mountains or swept away in avalanches \u2014 that others refused to do.\n\nTheir arrival was called the Yellow Peril. Asian immigrants were seen as invasive and threatening to an entire American way of life, and over the next century, a series of laws were passed that excluded first the Chinese, but then also those from other Asian countries. By 1924, all Asian immigrants (with the exception of those from the Philippines, a country that had been annexed by the United States) were refused citizenship, naturalization, land ownership and, in some states, prevented from marrying those of another race.\n\nHollywood capitalized on these fears accordingly in their creations of Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan. The former, a calculating villain who appeared in a series of films beginning in the 1920s (the name, invented by its British creator, is a crude jingoist rhyme, neither Mandarin nor Cantonese), is a mask of a Chinese man, always portrayed with crudely slanted eyes, eyebrows like caterpillars and a thin dangling beard. The latter was a benevolent but subservient detective in a bowler hat who was popularized by a series of white actors in dozens of films beginning in the 1920s and into the 1980s. And even if Asian men weren\u2019t portrayed as the yellow-faced villain or the neutered helpmate, they were still always the other. As with almost any reviled minority group in America, the fear traces back to sex \u2014 the men were either sexless or sex-crazed. The women were conniving dragon ladies or docile concubines.\n\nIt was only in 1965, when immigration laws changed again, and the United States eliminated national-origin quotas and introduced a preference system based on family relationships as well as skills, that a new wave of Asian immigrants arrived. With them came a new stereotype, one that persists today: the model minority \u2014 competitive, goal-oriented and hard-working (but, notably, lacking in creativity, charm, sex appeal and humor). A recent lawsuit against Harvard University revealed how it systematically discriminates against Asian-American applicants, alleging that though Asian-American students consistently performed higher than other applicants when it came to test scores, grades and extracurriculars, they were consistently given lower scores for \u201cpositive personality,\u201d likability, courage, kindness and being \u201cwidely respected,\u201d according to the 160,000 student records included in the lawsuit\u2019s filing. (Harvard has denied the charges.)\n\nInscrutable. High-achieving. Soulless.\n\nWhy is it that the challenges of becoming part of a new country, of overcoming an immense language barrier or working twice as hard and twice as long are so rarely prized? I think often of the leap, for example, my mother made immigrating to this country from Taiwan, and how much she lost in translation. It\u2019s the little things you forget to explain or can\u2019t, at least right away, put into words. For years, my mother would tell me she was afraid of snakes, and I never understood why until we visited the house where she grew up in Keelung, a port city in northern Taiwan where the weather can shift in an instant, blue sky darkening to black. There, alongside a small garden, was a creek, and as we passed it, my mother remarked that that was where the bodies of dead snakes accumulated after each typhoon. The Chinese-American writer Weike Wang\u2019s short story \u201cOmakase,\u201d published this year in The New Yorker, captures this cultural muteness as well. In it, a young Chinese-American woman goes on a date with her white boyfriend to a sushi restaurant in Harlem. His relative ease in the restaurant and in his interactions with the Japanese chef show, on the one hand, a charismatic personality. But on the other, it reveals a white man\u2019s assumption of being understood, in being welcome. It causes, at one point, the protagonist to reflect on an earlier moment when she introduced her boyfriend to her parents:\n\nHer mother was a housewife. Back in China, they\u2019d had different jobs. Her father had been a computer-science professor and her mother had been a salesclerk, but their success in those former roles had hinged on being loquacious and witty in their native language, none of which translated into English.\n\nIt\u2019s an obvious but understated point \u2014 the lack of charisma and expression that the protagonist\u2019s father possesses in English is not because he is a humorless and charmless man, but that the nuances of such expression are not, at that moment, available to him. It calls to mind the coded language used to describe Asians and Asian-Americans: \u201chard-working\u201d instead of brilliant, \u201cdiligent\u201d but not dazzling, \u201cfocused\u201d but not naturally gifted.", "Debbie Mucarsel-Powell has defeated Representative Carlos Curbelo, the two-term Republican incumbent, in a race that has been considered a bellwether for a \u201cblue wave\u201d in the House.

How long that takes is up to us, but I am optimistic.\n\nHistory shows us that America\u2019s progress in fulfilling our aspirations is an upward sloping line. Yes, our present has always fallen short of our values. After all, we were born in original sin \u2014 our nation\u2019s founders held inspiring truths to be self-evident while keeping human beings as slaves. But our history is one of continuous progress.\n\nUnfortunately, that line marking our progress is not a solid one. We make progress, then we regress, then we make progress again. The upward jag is always larger than the retreat, which is why the line has a positive slope upward across 242 years. But our line is jagged.\n\nIn his new book, \u201cThe Soul of America,\u201d the historian Jon Meacham reminds us that the years after the end of World War I were a period of stunning progress for our country. Women got the right to vote. Blacks moved into the growing industrial economy. Catholics and Jews flooded in as immigrants. But that change brought reaction. In the 1920s, the Klan was reborn. Millions of Americans joined the K.K.K., including 16 United States senators, 11 governors and dozens of members of the House of Representatives. Tens of thousands of Klansmen in white robes marched on the National Mall in Washington. Immigration was severely restricted. Then the Klan fever broke in the late 1920s and we resumed our upward progress. That\u2019s the story of America.", "Young people historically vote at lower rates, typically, than other age groups, and that has been especially true of the midterms. But this year, registration for younger voters is up substantially, with some studies anticipating the highest youth turnout in decades. We wanted to know what issues are motivating young people at such impressive rates this year, so we asked. In just a few days we had more than 800 passionate, sharp and often surprising responses.\n\nThe respondents frequently mentioned climate change, no matter their party affiliation, and health care, as well as a fear of the country\u2019s growing political divide.\n\nMany who said they were either too na\u00efve or unconcerned to participate in past elections seemed doubly eager to exercise their right this time around.\n\nFor Lea Klock, 22, of Michigan, her youth had everything to do with her reason for voting. \u201cI am tired of older Americans deciding everything in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA deficit is something that I will have to pay off; climate change will be the problem of my generation; and discrimination will be the ugly legacy that I will have to explain to my children.\u201d", "I realize we are not entirely in accord on this matter.\n\nBret: Tax cuts, I like. Deficits, I don\u2019t mind (as long as there is robust economic growth). But I like the Republic even more, and I\u2019d hate to see Trump\u2019s first two years in office vindicated with wins in both houses of Congress. So I\u2019m prepared to forgo additional tax cuts in the hope, probably vain, that Democrats will be strategic stewards in the House and not give in to the stupid temptation of seeking Trump\u2019s impeachment or getting lost in endless committee investigations about whether Trump misled the I.R.S. 20 or 30 years ago.\n\nI\u2019d also love to see the emergence of Democratic presidential contenders who aren\u2019t the same people now auditioning for the role.\n\nGail: Which includes \u2026 pretty much everybody. Are you hoping for a governor who hasn\u2019t raised his or her hand? A former cabinet member who\u2019s been working in the library on a new book for the last two years? Tom Hanks? Everybody likes Tom Hanks.\n\nBret: Well, I can think of one former Hollywood actor who turned out to be a great president, so I\u2019m not ruling it out. And as much as Ronald Reagan was hated by progressives, he did a lot to unite the country, which is what we could use now. The hideous anti-Semitic massacre in Pittsburgh, and the resistance of many Pittsburgh residents to Trump even showing up, is another reminder that Trump can\u2019t fulfill even the most basic presidential duty of consoling a wounded nation. We need a Democrat who can address the fact that the United States is in a moral recession even in the midst of an economic boom.\n\nGail: We may be down to Tom Hanks.\n\nBret: Or Michelle Obama.\n\nGail: But seriously, I keep thinking about how we got to Trump, and how Trump got to Trump. He was a guy with virtually no political principles or governmental ideas when he started out. And early on, when you asked him why he was so obsessed with a wall, or why he had apparently changed his mind on abortion and gun control, the answer would invariably be that the crowd went crazy over that.\n\nHe\u2019s a total creation of the yelling crowds. Sure, he gets huge audiences, because they know he\u2019s going to tell them exactly what they want to hear. And when they roar their approval, it reinforces his determination to do whatever they scream loudest about.\n\nI guess the big question is how much the people who come out to howl at his rallies reflect the people who come out to vote.", "Happy with your subway or train ride right now?

In a poll earlier this year, Latter-day Saint approval of President Trump stood highest of all religious groups. Senator Flake demonstrated that his rhetorical denunciations of President Trump would not translate into effective opposition to administration policy. Mr. Romney has repeatedly proved willing to make peace with the president and the powers that be. His most recent rhetorical contortions on immigration \u2014 which he has variously described as more \u201ccompassionate\u201d and more hawkish than the president\u2019s \u2014 exemplify the difficulty of pinning down Mr. Romney\u2019s politics generally let alone of drawing straight lines between his religious identity and his relationship to this administration\u2019s agenda.\n\nWhen people ask me about Mr. Romney and Mr. Flake, they are often well aware of these severe limitations on Latter-day Saint opposition to the White House. Still, at the very least, they want to make sense of the rhetoric.\n\nThe politically charged resources that we share can push in multiple directions. The same memory of religious persecution that recoils at Mr. Trump\u2019s Islamophobia also generates profound states-rights distrust of a federal government that once sent armed troops into Utah. The same theology of eternal family bonds that balks at Mr. Trump\u2019s misogynistic lechery can only with great difficulty accept his opponents\u2019 pro-choice platforms. Despite appearances in the \u201creddest of red states,\u201d Latter-day Saint values have never fit perfectly with the political divisions of the two-party system, but the age of Trump has made that misalignment much more pronounced.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh\u2019s hearing publicly displayed some of the choices Latter-day Saints face in the age of Mr. Trump. Mr. Flake\u2019s very public agonizing over the nomination became a vivid symbol of the struggles many of my coreligionists feel when they allow the current political moment to incite deeper forms of civic soul searching.\n\nAt the same time, Orrin Hatch\u2019s conspicuous absence of agony symbolizes the decisions of many of my coreligionists not to allow any such thing.\n\nAssuming Mr. Romney wins a seat in the United States Senate, he will have to decide when and how to make common cause with the leader of his party. Will he draw on his experience as a missionary in France to resist isolationism and xenophobia? Will he utilize his memories as a lay church leader in Boston, where he devoted untold hours of ministry to vulnerable individuals and communities, to temper the president\u2019s brutalizing rhetoric of winners and losers? Will he let a distinctly Latter-day Saint reverence for the United States Constitution embolden him to check abuses of executive power?\n\nIf he wants to counteract the man to whom he once attributed the potential \u201cunraveling of our national fabric,\u201d he will have plenty of religious resources to bring to bear.

Mohsin Hamid\u2019s slender novel EXIT WEST takes the geopolitics out of war completely \u2014 it doesn\u2019t even name the country being ravaged \u2014 and views it purely through the lens of a young couple, Nadia and Saeed, who fall in love among the ruins. The language is spare and unsentimental; Hamid follows the young couple to bleak refugee camps in Mykonos, London and Marin County, Calif. (he names those places, sketching out a dystopian portrait of a world coping with a mass-migration future). Nadia and Saeed are brave, heartbreaking and utterly credible. But they make their journey around the world by passing through mysterious black doorways \u2014 an abrupt turn to magical realism that has left some readers puzzled.

(But even that does not necessarily mean employees will get time off, since many workers could find that time before or after their shifts.)\n\n[Read more about how, when and where to vote here.]\n\nSome states, like California, Minnesota and Maryland, say that if employees need to take time off to vote, employers should pay them as long as they meet certain conditions; others, like Georgia, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, do not mandate such payment. Some states allow early voting more than a month in advance; others allow one or two weeks. In a few states, including Connecticut, Alabama and Kentucky, there is no early voting at all. (Absentee ballots are still an option, but states vary \u2014 again \u2014 in how strictly those are regulated.)\n\nAnd in some places, people don\u2019t even need to deal with voting booths.

About 12 percent of children in America now carry a diagnosis of A.D.H.D, and there was a 40-fold increase in childhood bipolar disorder diagnoses between 1994 and 2003. Five times as many children are now prescribed psychostimulant and antipsychotic medications as were in the 1980s. Today, a quarter of children and teenagers take prescription drugs regularly, and seven percent of older adolescents and young adults report abusing opioids \u2014 most of whom were initially prescribed them by a doctor.\n\nWith millions of Americans taking risky medications for questionable diagnoses, have we medicalized everyday life?\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of factors that have gotten us here. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has taken an active, sometimes dubious, role in defining and promoting new diagnoses, through direct-to-consumer advertising and physician outreach efforts.\n\nOften overlooked, however, are how the psychologies of doctors and patients contribute. Clinical encounters that don\u2019t end with a definitive diagnosis \u2014 a clear acknowledgment of the enemy \u2014 are inherently unsatisfying. Doctors, through their training and mandate, are motivated to package a constellation of symptoms into something that can be understood, named and treated.\n\nAt the same time, we have both a growing arsenal of medications to fix patients\u2019 problems and a steadily shrinking number of minutes in which to do so. Not surprisingly, the path of least resistance becomes labeling and prescribing instead of exploring and managing.\n\nPatients are motivated by the understandable desire to name and ease their suffering \u2014 and today, many more patients have that opportunity. But it also means that much of normal human experience is treated with prescriptions instead of patience. This is perhaps not surprising. We increasingly have easy solutions at our fingertips: Dial-up modems have given way to broadband; stores are being replaced by Amazon drones; courtship is now Tinder. Is it wrong for patients to expect quick fixes from medicine?\n\nAn important step forward may be putting more emphasis on nonprescription remedies. For many medicalized conditions, lifestyle changes are often just as effective as medications, if not more so (and don\u2019t come with side effects).", "Our columnist, Jada Yuan, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2018 list.

He refused, telling a local radio host, \u201cIt really diminishes democracy if you\u2019re going to show up to a meeting to just scream and yell.\u201d Instead, he said, he was appearing on \u201cevery national TV show,\u201d as if that were a substitute for facing his constituents.\n\nOn Tuesday, he may wish he\u2019d just showed up. Frustrated by a representative who didn\u2019t represent her, Grechen Shirley decided to challenge King. She\u2019s giving him what the The New York Post called \u201cthe toughest race of his career,\u201d a race that\u2019s emblematic of a season in which fed-up women are upending the political status quo.\n\nGrechen Shirley is 37; King has been in office since she was 12. She has a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old, and before 2016, she hadn\u2019t considered running for office anytime soon.

I huff and puff when stuck in a sluggish line at a coffee shop. Slow cars in the fast lane send me into a curse-filled tizzy. I\u2019m ashamed how quickly I lose my cool over these minor things. I\u2019ve often wished I could be a more patient person, but it\u2019s overwhelming to know where to start.\n\nPatience, the ability to keep calm in the face of disappointment, distress or suffering, is worth cultivating. The virtue is associated with a variety of positive health outcomes, such as reducing depression and other negative emotions. Researchers have also concluded that patient people exhibit more prosocial behaviors like empathy, and were more likely to display generosity and compassion.\n\nA 2012 study in the Journal of Positive Psychology identified three distinct expressions of patience: 1. Interpersonal, which is maintaining calm when dealing with someone who is upset, angry or being a pest. 2. Life hardships, or finding the silver lining after a serious setback. And 3. Daily hassles, which is suppressing annoyance at delays or anything irritating that would inspire a snarky tweet.\n\nThe good news is that same study found that patience as a personality trait is modifiable. Even if you\u2019re not a particularly patient person today, there\u2019s still hope you can be a more patient person tomorrow.

Independent polls and officials in both parties suggested that Brian Kemp, the Georgia secretary of state and the Republican nominee, and Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate who is vying to become the first black woman elected as a governor in the United States, could end up in a December runoff after a tense general election campaign.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats looked at this as an opportunity, especially with an African-American female, to really spend some money, and, of course, the Republicans had to respond,\u201d said Lynn Westmoreland, a Republican former congressman from west Georgia, referring to the state-record amount of spending for a governor\u2019s race. He described this campaign as the most intense he could recall since the General Assembly had to settle the 1966 governor\u2019s race.\n\nNearly 2.1 million people voted early in Georgia, according to statistics that state officials released on Monday, more than doubling the previous record for an election year in which the Governor\u2019s Mansion was at stake.

Some hired McKinsey & Company and other outside consultants to help them with their bids, investing heavily in courting Amazon and its promise of 50,000 jobs. Even half of that would amount to one of the largest corporate location deals, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, which tracks corporate subsidies. \u201cThese are very big numbers,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Amazon\u2019s search dragged on, residents in many of 20 finalist cities worried about the impact such a massive project could have on housing and traffic, as well as what potential tax incentives could cost the community. The decision to split into two sites could alleviate some of that resistance.\n\nSeattle has been one of the fastest growing cities in the country, in part because of Amazon\u2019s growth. The company has about 45,000 employees in the city, and the company said it needed to hire more employees than the city could attract or absorb.\n\n\u201cNot everybody wants to live in the Northwest,\u201d Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon\u2019s retail division, said at a conference last year. \u201cIt\u2019s been terrific for me and my family, but I think we may find another location allows us to recruit a different collection of employees.\u201d\n\nAmazon gave cities six weeks to pitch themselves in a public courtship. Almost 240 municipalities responded, trying to lure the tech giant with marketing gimmicks, promises of new transit lines and, as proposals trickled out, billions in tax incentives.\n\nThe details of most bids are not public, to the frustration of even some lawmakers. A few elected officials from the short list of 20 cities signed what amounted to a mutual nonaggression pact, trying to avoid a bidding war that would give up too much from taxpayers.\n\nBut mostly, cities continued their hard sell, showing Amazon executives around their proposed sites and trying to assure the company that the region had sufficient housing and transportation. Since wrapping up visits with cities in the spring, Amazon has been almost silent on the search. That led journalists, residents and politicians to look for clues in new job postings and the flight path of the corporate jet used by Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive.", "Amid questions about their views on marijuana, their feelings about law enforcement and their fluency in Spanish, only one said that she was afraid of Mr. Guzman. Another admitted that the words \u201cEl Chapo\u201d mostly made him think about a bagel sandwich served by a deli near his workplace that was named for the defendant. A third spent most of his time as he was questioned talking about his job as a Michael Jackson impersonator.\n\nMany of the jurors said they recognized Mr. Guzman\u2019s name and had at least heard that he was an international kingpin who had famously escaped from two Mexican prisons. Of the 46 people questioned on Monday by Judge Brian M. Cogan, 17 were dismissed, most of them because they said they could not be fair to Mr. Guzman or because the long trial would cause a financial hardship.\n\nSecurity was exceedingly tight. The courthouse was guarded by marshals, local court officers, a bomb-sniffing dog and a heavily armed tactical team of New York City police officers. Precautions like these apparently unnerved one potential juror, who admitted that the prospect of deciding Mr. Guzman\u2019s fate made her feel \u201cunsafe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat scares me is I read that his family will come after jurors and their families,\u201d the woman said. She added that she knew that Mr. Guzman had two sons who were still at large. When a defense lawyer asked her if that made her nervous, she admitted that it did.\n\nSeveral prospective jurors said they were familiar with Mr. Guzman from the Netflix series \u201cEl Chapo\u201d or had seen his page on Wikipedia, but they seemed largely unaware that he had been charged almost a decade ago with running a criminal enterprise that smuggled cocaine and heroin into the United States from Mexico in a rotating fleet of cars, trucks, yachts, planes and submarines.

He told them that when he tried to vote early, his local polling station was closed because of flooding, with no official notice posted about where else to go. But volunteers rushed to distribute fliers with alternate polling stations, so he was able to cast his vote for Ms. Abrams.\n\n\u201cI thought it was messed up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fall for that thing that your vote doesn\u2019t count.\u201d He grew up in South Carolina and bears a scar on his stomach from falling after white children set a dog on him in elementary school, he said. \u201cTo think we\u2019re going backward 30, 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s got to change.\u201d", "In recent years, BMI and ASCAP have written exemptions into these contracts giving musicians the right to stop a politician from using their songs.

Calls for law and order on the border are taken as code for racism. The phrase \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d has been struck from the Democratic lexicon. Anything that is pro-immigrant is seen as enlightened, and anything that restricts immigration is regarded as morally suspect. This framing unwittingly cuts the legs out from any position that falls short of open borders.\n\nPolitically, Democrats have wound up in a place where they decry the policies that restrict undocumented immigration, but they don\u2019t really have any other policies to replace them. Progressives are for abolishing ICE and our current asylum-detention procedures, but what would they put in their stead?\n\nAfter 30 years of multiculturalism, the bonds of racial solidarity trump the bonds of national solidarity. Democrats have a very strong story to tell about what we owe the victims of racism and oppression. They do not have a strong story to tell about what we owe to other Americans, how we define our national borders and what binds us as Americans.\n\nHere\u2019s the central challenge of our age: Over the next few decades, America will become a majority-minority country. It is hard to think of other major nations, down through history, that have managed such a transition and still held together.\n\nIt seems that the Democratic Party is going to lead us through this transition. The Republicans have decided to pretend it\u2019s not happening. Trump had a chance to build a pan-ethnic nationalist coalition but went with white identity politics instead. Republicans have rendered themselves irrelevant to the great generational challenge before us.\n\nBut if the Democrats are going to lead this transition, they\u2019ll need not just a mind-set that celebrates diversity, but also a mind-set that creates unity. They\u2019ll need policies that integrate different groups into a coherent nation, with shared projects, a common language and culture and clear borders.\n\nIf you don\u2019t offer people a positive, uplifting nationalism, they will grab the nasty one. History and recent events have shown us that.", "Whatever happens in the midterms, the aftermath will be ugly. But the elections are nonetheless a fork in the road. If we take one path, it will offer at least a chance for political redemption, for recovering America\u2019s democratic values. If we take the other, we\u2019ll be on the road to autocracy, with no obvious way to get off.\n\nIt\u2019s a near-certainty that Democrats will receive more votes than Republicans, with polling suggesting a margin in votes cast for the House of Representatives of seven or more percentage points \u2014 which would make it the biggest landslide of modern times. However, gerrymandering and other factors have severely tilted the playing field, so that even this might not be enough to bring control of the chamber.\n\nAnd even if Democrats do climb that tilted slope, anyone expecting Republicans to accept the result with good grace hasn\u2019t been paying attention. Remember, Donald Trump claimed \u2014 falsely, of course \u2014 that millions of immigrants voted illegally in an election he won. Imagine what he\u2019ll say if he loses, and what his supporters will do in response. And if and when a Democratic House tries to exercise its powers, you can be sure it will be met with defiance, never mind what the Constitution says.\n\nBut ugly as the scene will be if Democrats win, it will be far worse if they lose. In fact, it\u2019s not hyperbole to say that if the G.O.P. holds the line on Tuesday, it may be the last even halfway fair elections we\u2019ll ever have.", "Though much remains clouded in the murder of the Saudi journalist-in-exile Jamal Khashoggi, this much is clear: Saudi Arabia\u2019s rulers are ruthless and not to be trusted or believed. It is now time to recognize those realities in the kingdom\u2019s unspeakably cruel war in Yemen. The Trump administration has been prodded into demanding a cease-fire, but that seems only to have provoked new fighting. The United States, Britain and other enablers of the Saudi campaign can and must demand an immediate halt to the carnage.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, revealed his true face in his lies about how Mr. Khashoggi met his end, though it was his thugs who strangled and dismembered the loyalist-turned-critic in their Istanbul consulate.\n\nHard on the furor over that murder, The Times published heart-rending reporting and photography by Declan Walsh and Tyler Hicks from the killing fields of Yemen, a war that Prince Mohammed has waged with murderous bombing raids using weapons largely provided by the United States.

The daily meditation, diet and exercise routines are chronicled down to each mandatory smoothie. The proprietress\u2019s grandiose ideas about what she will do for her guests take up significant space, too. People duck each other at first, then begin talking way too much about the problems that brought them to Tranquillum \u2014 and there is no limit to the number of subplots Moriarty is eager to cram into a single book. Some of the problems are tragic (lost children; yes, that\u2019s plural). Others (an addiction to cosmetic surgery, the miseries of winning the lottery) are silly beyond belief.\n\nImage Liane Moriarty Credit Rachel Kara Ashton for The New York Times\n\nBut there\u2019s more going on here than just confessional chatter. Moriarty has tapped into a trendy therapeutic topic that gives her book its novelty. It should stimulate her fan base\u2019s curiosity, and it gives this otherwise bland book an excuse to go way off the deep end. And it brings out the most extreme behavior in everyone present, especially Masha, the proprietress, who was none too stable to begin with. Not even the Buddha gets out of \u201cNine Perfect Strangers\u201d without sounding slightly menacing once the book hits its temporary insanity phase. (\u201cArdently do today what must be done. Who knows? Tomorrow death comes.\u201d)\n\nAt least Moriarty quickly abandons her slow rollout of characters and days and lets the scene at Tranquillum begin to jell on its own. Frances is by far the best of the bunch, even if at 52 she thinks about menopausal hot flashes a lot. Her career writing bodice-rippers began with something called \u201cNathaniel\u2019s Kiss,\u201d its hero \u201ca heady mix of Mr. Rochester and Rob Lowe.\u201d Somehow, she got away with that for a long time. But two husbands and a lot of books later, she\u2019s washed up and at an impasse. Still, she has a writer\u2019s gift for bestowing colorful nicknames on all this story\u2019s other characters and deeming herself the central figure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about me,\u201d she says at one very odd moment. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure of my love interest yet.\u201d\n\nRest assured that there are candidates for that honor. Moriarty didn\u2019t put this book together to send everyone home as unfulfilled and wretched as they started. Each person reveals why he or she is so enraged, vain, sulky, frustrated, disappointed and so on. And if all it took were the Titanic staircase and a few stiff hikes to turn lives around, what an inspiring story this would be. Unfortunately, Moriarty is so wildly out of control that the same book that emphasizes wellness also includes one character\u2019s healthy smack at another with an antique candelabra.\n\nAfter the huge success of \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d Moriarty has become a Hollywood darling despite the uneven caliber of her earlier work, and Nicole Kidman is already involved in a film version of \u201cNine Perfect Strangers.\u201d She fits the physical description of the exotically beautiful 6-foot Masha, but it will be interesting to see if she wants to play anyone quite so \u2026 challenging. In any case, this book won\u2019t lend itself as easily to screen adaptation, since such odd things happen to such fundamentally uninteresting people.

Barclays was facing demands that it pay nearly $7 billion to settle civil claims that it had sold toxic mortgage investments that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis, and the Royal Bank of Scotland was ensnared in a criminal investigation over its role in the crisis. In the case of Walmart, it became increasingly difficult at the end of the Obama administration to get the company\u2019s lawyers to schedule meetings.\n\nWalmart had reason to hope that the Trump administration might be more sympathetic. After the Walmart bribery scandal first came to light in an investigation published in The Times in 2012, Mr. Trump, then a real estate mogul with international holdings, said on CNBC that it was unfair to expect a company like Walmart not to engage in bribery when doing business overseas. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, he said, was a \u201chorrible law, and it should be changed.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors and the S.E.C. have yet to charge Walmart.\n\nThe Justice Department did reach a settlement with Barclays, but it was for a much lower amount ($2 billion) than the Obama administration had sought.

Scientists are not sure exactly what dogs are smelling, but it is known that malaria parasites produce volatile aldehydes like those found in perfumes.\n\nThe parasites may have evolved the ability to exude odoriferous chemicals in order to attract mosquitoes to carry them to new hosts. Studies have shown that mosquitoes prefer to bite people who have malaria.\n\nIf just one chemical indicated cancer or malaria, \u201cwe\u2019d have discovered it by now,\u201d said Claire Guest , who founded Medical Detection Dogs in 2008 and oversaw dog training in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a tune of many notes, and the dogs can pick it up.\u201d\n\nMost breeds have good noses, she said, but the best for this task are dogs bred to hunt \u2014 like pointers, spaniels and Labradors \u2014 and dogs with relaxed relationships with their owners.\n\nThe initial trials were just to prove that detection was feasible, said Steve W. Lindsay , an entomologist at Durham University in Britain who said he was inspired by a dog sniffing luggage for contraband food at Washington Dulles airport.\n\nThis preliminary study involved training just two dogs to sniff rows of jars containing bits of thin nylon socks that had been worn overnight by Gambian children.\n\nWhen the dogs, a Labrador-golden retriever mix named Lexi and a Labrador named Sally, recognized the telltale odors, they were supposed to stop and point at the jar.", "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.\n\n__________\n\nAn important cog in the global financial system has succumbed to pressure from the Trump administration and severed ties with Iranian banks.\n\nBelgian-based Swift, whose messaging service connects more than 11,000 financial institutions as they transfer money around the world, said it was disconnecting from Iranian banks after the United States announced sanctions against 50 of the country\u2019s financial firms on Monday.\n\nThe service declined to say whether it was cutting off all the targeted banks.

"With Americans going to the polls on Tuesday, it is down to the wire for social media companies to show that they have clamped down on disinformation and foreign interference through their sites. The companies want to prove that the midterm elections will not be a repeat of 2016, when Russian operatives used Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to spread divisive messages in an attempt to influence how the American electorate voted.\n\nFacebook, which has borne the brunt of scrutiny over election interference, has introduced measures to limit who can buy political ads, has hired more people to monitor what gets posted, and has constructed a \u201cwar room\u201d to root out false information and stop it from spreading. Last week, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, told investors that the company was getting \u201cbetter and better\u201d at detecting election interference but that \u201cthere are going to be things that our systems miss no matter how well tuned we are.\u201d\n\nA close look at Twitter also suggests that disinformation and election interference are far from under control. Even as the company has taken steps to reduce problems, new instances of misinformation campaigns continue to surface.\n\n\u201cOur work on this issue is not done, nor will it ever be,\u201d Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, told Congress in September. He said that the company had learned valuable lessons since the 2016 election and that it was now removing 214 percent more accounts a year for violating its policies against manipulation.\n\n[Here\u2019s a guide to everything you need to know about the November elections.]\n\nTwitter began looking more closely at election interference after the 2016 presidential vote. Late that year, it assembled a data science team to use technology to detect malicious and misleading behavior on its service. In particular, the team tries to identify oddities, like a cluster of accounts that were registered with the same email address or phone number, or accounts that were engaging in spammy behavior like tweeting constantly at high-profile accounts to amplify their posts.\n\n", "EBERSBACH-NEUGERSDORF, Germany \u2014 Frank Dehmel was on the streets of East Germany in 1989. Every Monday, he marched against the Communist regime, demanding freedom and democracy and chanting with the crowds: \u201cWe are the people!\u201d\n\nThree decades later, Mr. Dehmel is on the streets again, older and angrier, and chanting the same slogan \u2014 this time for the far right.\n\nHe won freedom and democracy when the Berlin Wall came down 29 years ago on Nov. 9. But he lost everything else: His job, his status, his country \u2014 and his wife. Like so many eastern women, she went west to look for work and never came back.\n\nTo understand why the far right is on the march again in Germany, it helps to understand the many grievances of its most loyal supporters: men in the former Communist East.", "\u201cIt feels different,\u201d Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the Democrat running against Mr. Curbelo, said over a plate of ceviche in a campaign office above a sushi-Thai restaurant at a strip mall. \u201cGillum, maybe, is getting people more excited.\u201d\n\nThis much enthusiasm is a departure. In past years, the party has struggled to raise money and field credible candidates in many districts. So thin is the Democratic bench, according to Mr. Buckhorn, the Tampa mayor, that even staffing a Gillum administration could be challenging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been out in the wilderness for so long that many of the folks who normally would step in are too old, out of politics or doing something else,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is a challenge Democrats would be happy to have.

He assessed policy by what he called \u201cHippocratic risk\u201d \u2014 a \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d tact that was civilized, conflict-light and let the banks \u201cearn their way back to health.\u201d\n\nAnd they sure did, with billions of zero-interest funds from the Fed, while homeowners suffered. The economy began to recover. Business as usual resumed. But a Rooseveltian moment to create fundamental change had passed.\n\nWhile he left office accomplished and popular, he failed to fulfill the core dictum of reversing the Reagan drumbeat of government as problem not solution.\n\nMr. Obama seemed stretched thin by his two central tenets: a preternatural dedication to civility and a promise to fundamentally change corrupt systems. To both get the urgent business of governing done and uphold civility, he needed a partner across the aisle to broker deals. But the modern Republican Party is built to fight, not govern. It respects only a bloody nose.\n\nIn the early Obama years, some administration officials would pass notes under the acronym WWLD (what would Lyndon do?) when they grew frustrated that Obama wouldn\u2019t twist arms, and maybe break a few, to get a return on his stunning political capital. But it\u2019s unclear whether President Johnson, were he exhumed, revived and asked to reconsider Senator Dick Russell\u2019s warning that passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act would lose the South for a generation, would still say, \u201cDick, if that\u2019s the price for this bill, then I will gladly pay it.\u201d\n\nPower, too forcefully wielded in a divided and diverse nation, can carry stunning costs. Still on the most salient issues, or in a crisis, maybe that\u2019s the risk worth taking. A brilliant man and prudent president, not embracing risk when he had the chance, partially set the table for Donald Trump \u2014 his tapping into outrage, his attacks on government\u2019s gutlessness and his misdirection of populists via rhetorical embrace of the working man.\n\nNow, rather than a careful professor, a reckless bully owns Washington \u2014 a lover of backlash, the embodiment of it. Courting it with every tweet and maneuver, like a matador waving his red cape before the crowd. And civility is at a nadir, buried. Mr. Obama was a believer in our constitutional construct of balance, \u201cthat ambition must be made to counteract ambition,\u201d as Madison wrote. But there needs to be enough ambition connected to compromise in order for it to be productive.", "In the closing days of the campaign for the midterms, President Trump has clearly decided that immigration should be the central issue of this election. Mr. Trump called a caravan of Central Americans heading toward the United States it \u201can assault on our country\u201d and asserted without evidence that it includes \u201cbad people\u201d and \u201cunknown Middle Easterners.\u201d He accused Democrats of having \u201csomething to do with it.\u201d He floated the idea of ending birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants. He circulated an ad about a Mexican man convicted of killing two police officers that said, \u201cDemocrats let him into our country.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s focus on immigration has had real consequences, even though congressional candidates across the country have chosen to focus on other issues, like the economy or health care. Compared to recent elections, voters\u2019 beliefs about immigration are more strongly related to how they plan to vote in congressional races. This shows how Mr. Trump is shaping how Americans vote even though he\u2019s not on the ballot. His brand of identity politics has metastasized to states and districts across the country.\n\nThe importance of immigration in 2018 has its roots in 2016. In the presidential election, attitudes toward immigration became more strongly correlated with voting for Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton than they were with voting for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in 2012. The increased role of immigration attitudes stemmed from the 2016 campaign itself: Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton took sharply divergent positions, embodied in Mr. Trump\u2019s call to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s argument that our diversifying nation was \u201cstronger together.\u201d Our research has shown that it was attitudes about identity-inflected issues like immigration \u2014 not a purely \u201ceconomic\u201d anxiety \u2014 that were distinctively important in 2016.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s victory helped him reshape how Americans see the Republican Party. Evidence from previous presidential administrations shows that presidents can influence their party\u2019s image. Already, Mr. Trump has pushed public perceptions of his party\u2019s position on immigration further to the right \u2014 just as he helped make the party appear more favorable to Russia and Vladimir Putin. Only a few years ago, immigration policy created a genuine debate within the Republican Party, and a visible faction of Republican politicians wanted a moderate compromise. Mr. Trump has arguably marginalized that faction.", "The party celebrated the 30th anniversary with great fanfare in 2008, but official plans to commemorate the 40th anniversary this year have been scaled back considerably, according to a veteran journalist with a state news outlet. \u201cOnce you dredge up these matters, it\u2019s very easy to lose control and set off new debate,\u201d the journalist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nDuring Mr. Xi\u2019s visit to southern China last month, he noted the coming anniversary, attended an exhibition devoted to it and vowed to continue the economic transition that Deng began, but did not mention Deng \u2014 at least in the remarks chronicled by the state news media.\n\nInevitably, many compared the trip to the famous \u201csouthern tour\u201d in 1992 that Deng used to steer the nation back toward market-oriented policies and out of the diplomatic isolation and economic retrenchment that followed the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.\n\n\u201cXi Jinping has been pickpocketing policies from the Deng era,\u201d Geremie R. Barm\u00e9, an Australian scholar of China, wrote this summer. \u201cHe does so while diminishing the man hailed for decades as the \u2018Architect of Reform and the Opening Door Policies.\u2019 At the same, he crucially overrides aspects of Deng\u2019s legacy that might limit his afflatus and sense of mission.\u201d\n\nMr. Barm\u00e9, in an interview, said Mr. Xi was eager to position himself as \u201cthe greater unifier after Mao,\u201d relegating Deng and the leaders who followed him to an era of economic transition leading to a new era of strength that only he can achieve. Tellingly, Mr. Xi\u2019s trip included a visit to China\u2019s southern military command, where he urged commanders \u201cto strengthen the mission\u201d and focus on \u201cpreparations for fighting a war.\u201d", "Work Friend is here to help with careers, money and the sometimes grim, sometimes hilarious Dungeons & Dragons-type maze that is the contemporary office.

But during the past decade, he said, donations patterns have changed and walks, in particular, have become less popular.\n\n\u201cBecause A.C.S.\u2019s walks generated so much revenue and were such a large part of our portfolio, our declines were much more pronounced than some other organizations,\u201d Mr. Reich said. \u201cWe have been re-engineering and diversifying our revenue portfolio, and partnerships are playing a key role. This takes time to build, but we are making tremendous progress.\u201d", "Many economists believe AI has the potential to change the economy\u2019s basic trajectory in the same way that, say, electricity or the steam engine did.\n\n\"I do think artificial intelligence is \u2026 coming of age,\" said St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard in an interview. \"This will diffuse through the whole economy and will change all of our lives.\u201d\n\nBut the speed of the transformation will depend in part on the availability of technical talent.\n\nA shortage of trained workers \"will definitely slow the rate of diffusion of the new technology and any productivity gains that accompany it,\" said Chad Syverson, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.\n\nU.S. government data does not track job openings or hires in artificial intelligence specifically, but online job postings tracked by jobsites including Indeed, Ziprecruiter and Glassdoor show job openings for AI-related positions are surging. AI job postings as a percentage of overall job postings at Indeed nearly doubled in the past two years, according to data provided by the company. Searches on Indeed for AI jobs, meanwhile increased just 15 percent. (For a graphic, please see https://tmsnrt.rs/2CEi4eG\n\nUniversities are trying to keep up. Applicants to study artificial intelligence in UC Berkeley's electrical engineering and computer sciences doctoral program numbered 341 a decade ago, but by last year had surged to 2,700, according to the department. The entering class of AI students was 38 in the fall of 2017, up from 10 in the fall of 2008.\n\nAt the University of Illinois, professor Mark Hasegawa-Johnson last year tripled the enrollment cap on the school's intro AI course to 300. The extra 200 seats were filled in 24 hours, he said.\n\nCarnegie Mellon University this fall began offering the nation's first undergraduate degree in artificial intelligence. \"We feel strongly that the demand is there,\" said Reid Simmons, who directs CMU's new program. \"And we are trying to supply the students to fill that demand.\"", "NYTimes.com no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

So by the time the Swedish musician and actress Lykke Li wrapped her scenes opposite Ryan Gosling in Malick\u2019s wistful 2017 record-industry romance \u201cSong to Song,\u201d she needed a vacation. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, you should go to Mexico City \u2014 it\u2019s the best,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI went on a whim and ended up at a house party. And then I met Yola.\u201d\n\nYola is Yola Jimenez, a sprightly Mexico City local who\u2019d inherited her grandfather\u2019s Oaxacan mezcal farm \u2014 and who had brought along \u201cbatches and batches of her own mezcal,\u201d Li says. She typically drank whiskey while on tour (her latest wraps on Nov. 10 in Stockholm). But the clear, smoky, agave-based spirit cast a spell on the singer, whose downbeat pop has a similarly witchy feel. \u201cI had the craziest night in Mexico City and then just fell in love with mezcal, the city, Yola, everything,\u201d she says.\n\nLi slept for a few hours, woke up without a hangover \u2014 \u201cI felt amazing\u201d \u2014 then met her new friend for brunch at Contramar, chef Gabriela C\u00e1mara\u2019s chic, all-day seafood restaurant. There she tried another first: aguachile, a heat-spiked fresh-fish ceviche. Her own shrimp aguachile recipe (below), which she and friends enjoy during her downtime at her home in Los Angeles, was inspired by that meal. And the accompanying cocktail is made with Yola mezcal, a commercially available bottling of the spirit Jimenez brought to that fateful party.

"WARSAW \u2014 Despite making major gains in provincial assemblies, Poland\u2019s populist ruling party suffered a sweeping defeat in municipal voting in a set of elections that concluded on Sunday, confirming that Poland is a nation ever more deeply divided between its liberal cities and its conservative countryside.\n\nIn elections for local and regional offices around the country, the governing Law and Justice won just four of 107 mayoral races, down from the 11 it won four years ago.\n\nYet the party secured the most seats in nine out of 16 provincial assemblies and won outright

Law and Justice swept to power in a parliamentary vote in 2015, had the highest turnout in local contests since the fall of communism in 1989. The turnout in the first round of balloting was 17 to 20 percentage points higher than that four years ago, and the turnout in the runoff round, which is usually lower, was in many places almost identical to that from the first round, said Lukasz Pawlowski, the head of the Institute of Local Government Studies.", "To the Editor:\n\nWhat sets democracy apart from every other form of government is the input of ordinary citizens into their country\u2019s future. While the period in between elections remains owned, perhaps, by the rich or otherwise powerful, it is on Election Day that the largely powerless have their say.\n\nBy simply marking a ballot, ordinary citizens can tell a president to get packing and to welcome a new tenant to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThis year, it is the turn of congressmen and women, governors and all the rest to sweat the outcome of this election.

This stylization extends to the naming of the three acts, each for a figure who could be called a practitioner of satyagraha but none of whom have roles in the work: Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nBecause the libretto comprises only words from the Bhagavad Gita, it is up to the director how much, if any, of the biographical material to reveal to the audience \u2014 and how. At one end of the spectrum of possible \u201cSatyagraha\u201d productions is biopic; at the other, abstract ritual.\n\nIn Ms. Bj\u00f6rfors\u2019s staging, text is projected onto various surfaces of the set.

The audience gets exact dates and locations, as if sitting through a multimedia presentation at a museum.\n\nThis material doesn\u2019t always exist gracefully alongside the circus movements, which in turn don\u2019t always feel appropriate to the libretto or the score, expertly played but slightly starved in the reduced orchestration.

The photo, it turned out, was actually taken at a union event days earlier.", "These are only a few examples demonstrating that the best A.I. programs can be unreliable when faced with situations that differ, even to a small degree, from what they have been trained on. The errors made by such systems range from harmless and humorous to potentially disastrous: imagine, for example, an airport security system that won\u2019t let you board your flight because your face is confused with that of a criminal, or a self-driving car that, because of unusual lighting conditions, fails to notice that you are about to cross the street.\n\nEven more worrisome are recent demonstrations of the vulnerability of A.I. systems to so-called adversarial examples. In these, a malevolent hacker can make specific changes to images, sound waves or text documents that while imperceptible or irrelevant to humans will cause a program to make potentially catastrophic errors.\n\nThe possibility of such attacks has been demonstrated in nearly every application domain of A.I., including computer vision, medical image processing, speech recognition and language processing. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ease with which hackers could, in principle, fool face- and object-recognition systems with specific minuscule changes to images, put inconspicuous stickers on a stop sign to make a self-driving car\u2019s vision system mistake it for a yield sign or modify an audio signal so that it sounds like background music to a human but instructs a Siri or Alexa system to perform a silent command.\n\nThese potential vulnerabilities illustrate the ways in which current progress in A.I. is stymied by the barrier of meaning. Anyone who works with A.I. systems knows that behind the facade of humanlike visual abilities, linguistic fluency and game-playing prowess, these programs do not \u2014 in any humanlike way \u2014 understand the inputs they process or the outputs they produce. The lack of such understanding renders these programs susceptible to unexpected errors and undetectable attacks.\n\nWhat would be required to surmount this barrier, to give machines the ability to more deeply understand the situations they face, rather than have them rely on shallow features? To find the answer, we need to look to the study of human cognition.\n\nOur own understanding of the situations we encounter is grounded in broad, intuitive \u201ccommon-sense knowledge\u201d about how the world works, and about the goals, motivations and likely behavior of other living creatures, particularly other humans. Additionally, our understanding of the world relies on our core abilities to generalize what we know, to form abstract concepts, and to make analogies \u2014 in short, to flexibly adapt our concepts to new situations. Researchers have been experimenting for decades with methods for imbuing A.I. systems with intuitive common sense and robust humanlike generalization abilities, but there has been little progress in this very difficult endeavor.\n\nA.I. programs that lack common sense and other key aspects of human understanding are increasingly being deployed for real-world applications. While some people are worried about \u201csuperintelligent\u201d A.I., the most dangerous aspect of A.I. systems is that we will trust them too much and give them too much autonomy while not being fully aware of their limitations. As the A.I. researcher Pedro Domingos noted in his book \u201cThe Master Algorithm,\u201d \u201cPeople worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they\u2019re too stupid and they\u2019ve already taken over the world.\u201d\n\nThe race to commercialize A.I. has put enormous pressure on researchers to produce systems that work \u201cwell enough\u201d on narrow tasks. But ultimately, the goal of developing trustworthy A.I. will require a deeper investigation into our own remarkable abilities and new insights into the cognitive mechanisms we ourselves use to reliably and robustly understand the world. Unlocking A.I.\u2019s barrier of meaning is likely to require a step backward for the field, away from ever bigger networks and data collections, and back to the field\u2019s roots as an interdisciplinary science studying the most challenging of scientific problems: the nature of intelligence.\n\nMelanie Mitchell is Professor of Computer Science at Portland State University and External Professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

Hoping for an honest hearing of their hopes and grievances, they received a barrage of vitriol from an angry racist who hoped to thwart any revision of the Constitution that would guarantee rights for blacks. Johnson and his anxious conservative followers desired an America that was largely pre-1861, a society many Northerners believed had been buried by the sacrifices at Antietam, Fort Wagner and Gettysburg.\n\nDouglass led off the encounter by respectfully informing the president that they had come to ask for \u201cequality before the law,\u201d and to be \u201cfully enfranchised throughout the land.\u201d \u201cExtend us the ballot,\u201d Douglass pleaded, \u201cwith which to save ourselves.\u201d\n\nJohnson interrupted and for the next 40 minutes harangued and insulted his guests. He was willing to be their \u201cMoses,\u201d he declared. His \u201cfeelings\u201d had always been with blacks. \u201cI have owned slaves, and bought slaves, but I never sold one,\u201d he assured the delegation. He did not like being \u201carraigned\u201d by one \u2014 Douglass \u2014 \u201cwho could get up handsomely rounded periods and deal in rhetoric.\u201d If his guests pursued their goals of equality it would cause \u201crace war,\u201d and he insisted that the only good solution was for blacks to leave the country. As Douglass looked at him in disgust, Johnson asserted that in his relationship with blacks, \u201cI have been their slave instead of their being mine.\u201d\n\nJohnson then made a fierce defense of states\u2019 rights. The federal government could not force a state to follow its dictates, the president claimed. The \u201claw\u201d and majorities must be obeyed. As if he had not offended Douglass and his colleagues enough, Johnson then maintained that the truest victim of slavery and the war was the poor, non-slaveholding Southern white: \u201cThe colored man and his master combined to keep him in slavery.\u201d\n\nAs this disastrous meeting came to an end, Douglass did manage one direct claim to Johnson\u2019s face. \u201cThe very thing Your Excellency would avoid\u201d \u2014 a race war \u2014 \u201cin the Southern states can only be avoided by the very measure that we propose,\u201d i.e., black suffrage, Douglass said. As the delegation walked out, the president was overheard saying: \u201cThose damned sons of bitches thought they had me in a trap. I know that damned Douglass; he\u2019s just like any nigger, and would sooner cut a white man\u2019s throat than not.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of this worst-ever meeting between black leaders and an American president, Douglass did what he so frequently did in the middle of crises \u2014 he went to his desk, wrote a remarkable speech and took it out on the road. From Brooklyn to St. Louis, Douglass, who called his speech \u201cSources of Danger to the Republic,\u201d skewered Johnson as an \u201cunmitigated calamity\u201d of a president under whom, for now, the nation \u201cmust stagger.\u201d A constant refrain in this and other postwar speeches was his claim that \u201cslavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot.\u201d", "HOUSTON \u2014 The world\u2019s oil producers and their customers entered a new period of uncertainty on Monday as renewed American economic sanctions against Iran took effect.\n\nHaving withdrawn from the seven-nation deal negotiated under his predecessor to curb Iranian nuclear efforts, President Trump is aiming to pressure Iran to curb its political and military activities across the Middle East.

Cal\u2019s father, fearing the situation won\u2019t be safe for Cal, drops two bombshells: First, he and Cal are not white. They\u2019re Creek Indians. Second, he wants Cal to go to Challagi, the Indian boarding school in Oklahoma that he himself ran away from three times. While the education and the living conditions will be subpar, they\u2019re better than what Cal\u2019s getting now \u2014 and if his father can get his bonus they could go back to having a permanent home.\n\nAt Challagi, the days of draconian punishments are past, but still far more students run away than graduate. It\u2019s not an easy place \u2014 but it gives Cal a community, and a tribal identity he didn\u2019t realize he was lacking. He joins a band of boys, begins to learn to speak Creek and takes part in stomp dances at night in the woods. Cal\u2019s cleareyed first-person narration drives the novel. Meticulously honest, generous, autonomous and true, he sees things for what they are rather than what he\u2019d like them to be. The result is one of Bruchac\u2019s best books. Cal comes to see himself as a gentleman of two roads: one he travels with his father, and the other, a Creek road, that he negotiates himself. A detailed afterword explains sources for the story.\n\nTHE WAR OUTSIDE (Little, Brown, 318 pp., $17.99; ages 12 and up), by Monica Hesse (\u201cThe Girl in the Blue Coat\u201d), also takes a setting we think we understand and shifts it in an important way. Seventeen-year-old Haruko is a nisei, an American-born child of Japanese immigrants. In 1944, along with her younger sister and her mother, she travels from Denver to Texas, to join her father in a World War II family internment camp called Crystal City. Unlike the camps where West Coast Japanese-Americans were imprisoned en masse, Crystal City houses enemy aliens suspected of actually spying \u2014 and not just Japanese. Germans live in Crystal City, too. On her first day of high school in the camp, Haruko meets Margot, a first-generation German-American teenager whose family farmed in Iowa. Margot\u2019s father attended a Nazi meeting there. Margot hates Hitler but she\u2019s not sure what her increasingly unstable father actually believes. Meanwhile Haruko doesn\u2019t know why her father was sent to the camp, but she knows he\u2019s hiding something from her. Her brother, Ken, is fighting in the United States Army. Has her father somehow endangered him?\n\nImage\n\nCrystal City is divided, literally and metaphorically \u2014 Japanese on one side of the camp, Germans on the other. Neither side trusts the other; neither side is entirely trustworthy. Because the government considers the families to be prisoners of war, who might be repatriated to their birth countries and complain about their treatment, the facility is reasonably comfortable, with a well-appointed school and a vast community swimming pool. But it\u2019s still a prison, and both girls feel changed by their confinement. Haruko and Margot quickly forge an intense, wholly believable, somewhat erotic secret relationship. As the war careens to an end, tensions in the camp lead to violence. One of the girls is forced to betray the other. It\u2019s a tightly plotted exploration of the consequences of fear.", "His statistics this season \u2014 27 touchdowns and only one interception against just 132 passes; 12.2 yards per attempt \u2014 are comparable only to Oklahoma\u2019s Kyler Murray, who would be a stark Heisman front-runner in most other seasons.\n\nIs there in college football the equivalent of the 2016 LeBron James-led Cavaliers?

The Tigers face perhaps their toughest remaining test next Saturday at Boston College (7-2), which is ranked 17th.\n\nNo. 6 Oklahoma (8-1) or even, if we are so lucky, No. 10 Washington State (8-1) could conceivably engage the Tide in a shootout, though both are far from guaranteed to make the playoff. No. 4 Michigan (8-1) combines a solid Jim Harbaugh defense with, for maybe the first time under Harbaugh, a better-than-O.K. quarterback in Shea Patterson. No. 3 Notre Dame (9-0) beat Michigan and has otherwise not lost against inferior competition.\n\nOne team that Alabama will not be facing in the playoff is L.S.U. The past 20 years of SEC football have largely been the story of the two teams\u2019 respective fortunes. L.S.U. was revitalized beginning in 1999 with Saban\u2019s arrival as head coach, winning its first national championship in nearly 50 years after the 2003 season.\n\nBut Saban departed after the 2004 season for two years in the N.F.L., then returned to the college ranks in Tuscaloosa. L.S.U. won another championship in 2007. Alabama won its first under Saban in the 2009 season. In his first five games against L.S.U. while at Alabama, Saban was 2-3. But then the two teams met in the Bowl Championship Series title game in January 2012. Alabama dominated, 21-0. L.S.U. has not beaten the Tide since.\n\nThough oddsmakers favored Alabama in Saturday\u2019s game by as many as two touchdowns, L.S.U., with a top team of its own and perhaps the most intimidating environment in football, had cause for optimism.", "No one was killed during the kidnapping, officials said.\n\nSeparatists in Cameroon have been pushing for English-speaking regions to secede for decades, arguing that they lack political clout in the government, which is centered in French-speaking areas.

Taboo, a Polynesian word that Sigmund Freud translated as \u201choly dread,\u201d most often referred to an action that was both sacred and forbidden, consecrated and dangerous. It is an apt description of the Future Library, which grafts an environmental taboo onto an artistic one: trees that are planted to be cut down; books that are written not to be read.\n\nThe manuscripts are electrified by these taboos. In 2020, they will be moved to the New Deichmanske Library, currently under construction in Oslo, where they will be displayed in a \u201cSilent Room\u201d: a womb-shaped chamber facing the forest, lined with wood from its trees. Visitors will be able to enter, one or two at a time, to gaze at the manuscripts lying under their protective glass cases, waiting for the years to pass. More like a prayer closet than a reading room, Paterson describes the Silent Room as a \u201ccontemplative space.\u201d Her hope is that it will prompt the visitor\u2019s imagination to journey through \u201cdeep time\u201d to probe the mysteries of the forest.\n\nWhat Paterson\u2019s description of the Silent Room makes clear is that the books of the Future Library were never meant to be read, certainly not in our lifetime, but not even in the future. They are meant to be worshiped, to be desired \u2014 a desire that draws all its strength from the impossibility of reading or reproducing them: Theirs is the fetishization of the singular, the uninterpretable. Like the 48 surviving copies of the original Gutenberg Bible, the manuscripts are devotional rather than functional objects, the geneses of a new practice of reading and writing. The correspondence they stage between writer and reader is not the immediacy of address Shafak attributes to a book as it circulates in the world but the projection of a literary kinship so deep, so transcendent, that it is worth waiting for \u2014 worth dying without.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the re-enchantment comes at a time when books as objects are treated like endangered species, their vitality threatened by the rise of new media ecologies and economies. This is a false panic \u2014 there are more books published and printed now than ever \u2014 but it is an infectious one. You can hear the defensiveness in her voice when Paterson insists during the Handover Ceremony that, in a hundred years, \u201cThere will be life! There will be books!\u201d and it is surprising to note that her inflection falls harder on the latter than the former. What she means is that there will still be certain kinds of books: books written by authors already consecrated by the Western, white literary establishment; books which will be exempt from the vicissitudes of the market and preserved in what David Mitchell, referring to the Future Library, called \u201cthe Ark of Literature.\u201d But the ark does not preserve those who are most in need of preservation. It is firmly committed to those authors who have already proven themselves the fittest, at least according to the tastes of the current literary marketplace.\n\nWhat seems more na\u00efve is how the mystical valence of the book is tied to the fate of life on earth, as if the manuscript\u2019s totemic powers could somehow ward off ecological devastation. The hope that underwrites the Future Library is, in turn, underwritten by a near apocalyptic sense of doom. Ecocide is a frightening, complicated political issue, and yet the members of the Future Library Trust allude to it with a strange air of placidity. \u201cThis is a simple place,\u201d Hovind says of the clearing. Paterson echoes her sentiment. \u201cThis is an ordinary forest,\u201d she says, as if the simplicity or ordinariness of the trees meant that protecting them did not have to be complicated, as if everything that threatened them could be wished away.", "Dr. Hu may be the first third-generation (in terms of scientific pedigree) Ig Nobel winner, because Dr. Mahadevan studied under the late Joseph Keller, a mathematician at Stanford University. Dr. Keller won two Ig Nobels. One was for studying why ponytails swing from side-to-side, rather than up and down, when the ponytail owner is jogging. The other was an examination of why teapots dribble.\n\nAfter M.I.T., Dr. Hu did research at the Courant Institute at New York University, another hotbed of real-world mathematics. He moved to Georgia Tech, after Jeannette Yen, a biologist there, told the university they ought to take a look at him.\n\nFrom ants to self-assembling robots\n\nDr. Hu\u2019s research may seem like pure fun, but much of it is built on the idea that how animals move and function can provide inspiration for engineers designing human-made objects or systems.\n\nThe title of Dr. Hu\u2019s book refers to the \u201crobots of the future,\u201d and he emphasizes the way animal motion offers insights that can be applied to engineering \u2014 Bio-inspired design.\n\nWhen Brazil\u2019s Pantanal wetlands flood, for instance, fire ants form rafts so tightly interlaced that water doesn\u2019t penetrate their mass. When he picked up suc h a mass in the lab , Dr. Hu writes , it felt like a pile of salad greens.\n\n\u201cThe raft was springy, and if I squeezed it down to a fraction of its height, it recoiled back to its original shape. If I pulled it apart, it stretched like cheese on a pizza.\u201d\n\nHe found out that the ants were constantly moving even though the shape of the mass stayed more or less the same. They were breaking and making connections all the time, and they became, in essence, a \u201cself-healing\u201d material.", "Voting shouldn\u2019t be hard. But in some states, restrictive voting laws, typically passed by Republicans and disproportionately affecting minorities, can make it difficult.\n\nA recent report from the United States Commission on Civil Rights found that the federal government has taken less action to enforce voting rights for minorities in the five years since the Supreme Court struck down the core of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which had required nine states to seek federal approval before changing their election laws.\n\nIn Georgia, the \u201cexact match\u201d law, which was passed by the state\u2019s Republican-led Legislature in 2017, mandates that personal information on a voter registration form exactly match government databases. A missing hyphen could be grounds for a registration to be suspended, and the law has held up the processing of 53,000 new registrations \u2014 mainly of African-Americans.\n\nIn Ohio, thousands of voters were purged from the voting rolls in 2016 because they hadn\u2019t voted in recent years and didn\u2019t respond to a mailed postcard from election officials, a policy upheld by the Supreme Court.

On the line for the president will be his ability to legislate, build his promised border wall, appoint new judges and ultimately set the stage to run for a second term.", "The key weakness of early online voting systems was the inability to solve what cryptographers called the \u201cdouble spend problem.\u201d When we send a file on the internet, we\u2019re actually sending a copy of that file; the original remains in our possession. This is acceptable for sharing information but unacceptable for recording votes in elections. The possibility that individuals could cast their ballots multiple times for a candidate made these systems useless \u2014 just as vulnerable as paper ballot systems. Points of failure included susceptibility to hackers, coding bugs, and human error. With enough resources, any rogue could \u201cstuff\u201d a digital ballot box with illegitimate votes.\n\nThe good news is that building a workable, scalable, and inclusive online voting system is now possible, thanks to blockchain technologies. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer network for exchanging anything of value, from stocks, money, intellectual property, and, yes, votes. In a blockchain-based system, public trust in the voting process is achieved not by faith in one single institution, but through cryptography, code, and collaboration among citizens, government agencies, and other stakeholders.\n\nTraditionally in elections, trust is concentrated in the hands of state and federal agencies and other civic institutions, which are prone to hacking, fraud, or human error (think the Democratic National Committee, the Election Assistance Commission, or the California Department of Motor Vehicles). On a blockchain, a distributed network of computers works to verify transactions, with batches of them ordered and recorded in blocks. Each block is linked cryptographically to the preceding block, forming a secure chain or ledger that anyone in the network can see but no single entity can hack or manipulate.\n\nAn attacker who wanted to spend the same dollar twice or cast the same vote twice would need to take command of 51% of the computers in the network simultaneously and rewrite the entire history of each dollar or vote on the blockchain in a short time frame, which is exceedingly difficult. Since the network is widely distributed, it could survive a natural disaster or an attack on critical infrastructure. Thus, blockchain prevents double-spending, enabling us to run secure, trustworthy online transactions including voting.\n\nIn elections run on blockchains, citizens use digital voter IDs to prove who they are. Each digital ID is unique to each person, cryptographically secured with a private key (a unique password) on the person\u2019s device, and made up of multiple data points, or factors: proofs of residence and citizenship, biometric data, and voter registration, to name a few. Citizens open their app with their thumbprints or retinal scans and then cast their vote with their private key. The more data points used to create the digital ID, the harder the identity is to replicate and hack. Though voter registration is still required in most states, a robust multi-factor voter ID could eventually replace the registration altogether, as the combination of many data points would make it highly reliable.", "The United States ranks 26th out of the 32 developed countries in the world in terms of voter turnout.

What\u2019s the best way to approach him and set a price that\u2019s fair market value without a broker?\n\nA: New Yorkers occasionally buy and sell apartments from their neighbors. These deals often happen privately, without a broker. So, your neighbor should not be caught off guard if you approach him about a sale.\n\nWrite him a letter or an email. Offer your condolences for his loss and explain that you plan to put your apartment on the market, and want to know if he would be interested in making an offer.\n\nIf he expresses interest, you would need to set an asking price, something a real estate broker generally does. You could try to determine this number by searching comparable listings online and visiting open houses. But apartments have unique attributes. Your apartment may have a nicer view than a similar one in the building, or it may have been renovated more recently. Also, the market is softening overall, so you may not get as much as you would have a few months ago.", "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.\n\n__________\n\nAmerican companies are giving the country\u2019s politicians a civics lesson.\n\nWalmart, Tyson Foods, Levi Strauss and hundreds of other companies are encouraging their employees to cast a ballot in this week\u2019s congressional elections.

Unlike humans who may find ways to mask their irritability, sleepiness or lack of concentration, dinoflagellates are very direct about their inability to perform when their schedule is out of whack: They simply won\u2019t glow the same way. (A number of biologists who have helped advance our understanding of human sleep cycles made initial circadian breakthroughs with these organisms for connected reasons.)\n\nChildren can be similarly transparent, Dr. Deheyn points out.\n\n\u201cIf there is still light out, it\u2019s definitely not time to go to bed,\u201d he said, likening his 6-year-old son\u2019s experience with Daylight Saving Time to that of a dino with jet lag. \u201cEven though you try to explain the time change to him, his body will react to the light. It\u2019s only an hour. But it takes weeks to recover from that change.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, losing an hour is a big deal for reasons beyond lost sleep.\n\n\u201cRemember, we have clocks in every organ in our body,\u201d said Robert Thomas, the director of a sleep medicine fellowship at Harvard\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Any kind of shift, small or large, means, \u201cYou\u2019re not just moving sleep \u2014you\u2019re moving your entire body. It\u2019s like a giant ocean liner. A big ocean liner slowly chugging away. You can\u2019t just jerk it around.\u201d\n\nDr. Thomas, who also runs a sleep lab focused on helping individuals with extreme sleep disorders get on a more normal schedule, takes the impact of light seriously in his home as well. Every night at 8 p.m. he turns off all the lights so as to avoid the risk of pushing his circadian system into another time zone. Because we talked on the phone closer to 9, this meant his end of the conversation was conducted in complete darkness.\n\n\u201cIf jet lag was permanent, it would probably kill us,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in the grand scheme of circadian disruptions, a biannual shift in an hour is not the end of the world for humans \u2014 or dinoflagellates.\n\nDr. Deheyn advised dino owners to respect that their tiny pets may need a few days to adjust.

At the Chinese internet giant\u2019s valuation peak in January, the stake was worth over $180 billion \u2014 roughly 45 percent more than Naspers, which also owns newspapers, a Pan-African pay-TV operation and multiple online classifieds, food delivery and fintech businesses. (As an early investor in Alibaba, SoftBank\u2019s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, offers one of the few comparable examples of such an investment home run.)\n\nOne way for Naspers to narrow the discount between its own valuation and its Tencent stake was to sell off bits of Tencent to raise funds that it could reinvest in start-ups. It did that earlier this year, and netted $9.8 billion by selling a 2 percent stake. (It retains a 31.2 percent holding.) It used some of the proceeds to create an $8.2 billion fund, but Naspers shares have since struggled amid concerns that the cash will be wasted.\n\nThat is understandable. Collectively, its new e-commerce ventures \u2014 such as Russia\u2019s mail.ru or Germany\u2019s Delivery Hero \u2014 lost $615 million last year. Investors could be forgiven for seeing echoes of Mr. Son\u2019s faith in the cash-gobbling ride-hailing firm Uber in Naspers\u2019 investments so far.\n\nBut set against Tencent, Naspers shares have outperformed, which suggests that the firm has gotten some credit. Since the fund was announced on June 22, Naspers\u2019 14 percent decline has wiped $12 billion off its market value. Over the same period, the value of its remaining Tencent holding has lost $39 billion, a 26 percent drop.\n\nA focus on emerging markets means that Naspers\u2019 version of the Vision Fund is shielded from big losses by the relatively small amounts that can be invested \u2014 in Africa\u2019s nascent tech sector, $300 million goes a long way.

Given the importance of the Vision Fund to SoftBank, Mr. Son may feel he has no choice.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone. Big consulting firms like McKinsey & Company and Boston Consulting Group have kept Saudi contracts.

His remarks, before the United Nations Human Rights Council, came in a review of the kingdom\u2019s human rights record.\n\nTurkey has demanded, to no avail, that Saudi Arabia disclose what became of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s body, that it name the \u201clocal collaborator\u201d who a Saudi official has said helped dispose of the remains, and that it turn over the 18 suspects to face the Turkish justice system.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Sunday, Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s two sons, Salah and Abdullah, called for their father\u2019s body to be returned for a burial in Saudi Arabia.

Turkish investigators were not allowed into the consulate, which is considered Saudi sovereign territory, until Oct. 15. Sabah published photographs of Mr. Junabi and Mr. Zahrani emerging from the entrance of the consulate and also published photographs that the newspaper\u2019s investigative editor, Abdurrahman Simsek, said were head shots from cameras at airport passport control.\n\nThe men arrived on the same day as a Saudi delegation that met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Oct. 11, as Turkish officials demanded to know what had happened to Mr. Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government who lived in the United States and wrote opinion articles for The Washington Post. He had entered the consulate on Oct. 2 for a prearranged meeting to collect papers that would allow him to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, and was never seen again.\n\nWhen the group identified as a cleanup team was in Turkey, Saudi officials were still insisting that Mr. Khashoggi, 59, had left the consulate safely, and that they did not know where he was. They later acknowledged that he had been killed in the consulate, at first describing his death as the accidental result of a fight, and later calling it premeditated.", "When I was a freshman at the University of California, Riverside, in 1988, I drove a carload of excited fellow Vietnamese students to nearby Orange County. It was only 13 years after the end of the Vietnam War, but already there was a Vietnamese American Dream, symbolized by our destination, the Asian Garden Mall in Westminster. To the strains of Vietnamese pop music, we ate Vietnamese food, browsed Vietnamese goods, and sat in the balcony of the American-style mall, sipping Vietnamese iced coffee while we watched Vietnamese people.\n\nThe mall was the heart of the Little Saigon in Orange County. By 1988, Little Saigon was already firmly established, with multitudes of Vietnamese shops, restaurants and businesses lining Bolsa Avenue. This community was populated with Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese refugees who had fled the end of the war. It was deeply anti-Communist. Orange County as a whole was also anti-Communist and quite conservative, but it was also very white at the time. The arrival of so many refugees from Vietnam in the 1970s and 1980s was not welcomed by everyone in Westminster and Orange County.\n\nThirty years later, Westminster has a Vietnamese-American mayor, and Orange County has elected several Vietnamese-American politicians. Most have been Republicans, and vocally anti-Communist. But Communism is no longer the national issue it once was, and while the older generation of Vietnamese-Americans tends to be Republican and conservative, the younger generation has largely abandoned the Republican Party, either to become Democrats or independents. These shifts point toward larger changes in the once staunchly Republican Orange County, which is today leaning more Democratic and independent. The political changes are at least partly due to demographics in a county that is now one-fifth Asian and one-third Latino, whereas in 1980 four out of five residents were non-Latino white .\n\nThis mix of demographics and ideology in Orange County may be one of the prime reasons the Republican Party is committed to an anti-immigration agenda that seeks to turn America back to before 1965. It was then that a new law, the Immigration and Naturalization Act, created a more equitable immigration policy. For decades before, the United States had kept people out who came from Africa, Asia or Latin America, beginning with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. If you hail from one of those continents, the 1965 Immigration Act has mostly been a success. But for the Republican Party, whose base has been mostly white for years, the prospect of a majority-minority country that has arisen after 1965 might spell political decline.", "\u201cIt was a lot of work, I had to make two trips back and forth to Staten Island, by 5 o\u2019clock, which was not easy,\u201d she said. The program relies on volunteers who must drop off absentee ballot applications, pick up the ballots and bring them to the hospital, and then return to the Board of Elections to drop it off.\n\nBecause Ms. Smith and Ms. Schavrien wanted more patients\u2019 voices heard, they began planning to make it possible for every patient at Lenox Hill Hospital to vote by the 2020 election.\n\nSo what about women who are experiencing contractions near Election Day?\n\n\u201cOn T.V., labor happens very quickly and you have to move quickly, and that\u2019s not what happens, generally, in labor,\u201d said Ms. Smith, who is pregnant and will be induced, if she doesn\u2019t go into labor first, on Nov. 13. \u201cThere are pauses, say, and depending on where you are in labor, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019d be done with labor by the time I need to give you the information.\u201d\n\nIf there is a partner or family member in the room, they will help them vote by absentee and collect their ballot, too.

By the 1930s, the nation\u2019s first political consultants, Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter, began to carve out a niche business, handling 65 initiative campaigns over 15 years.\n\nMr. Whitaker and Mr. Baxter, and the political-consultant industry they spawned, fueled a rapid growth in initiatives by the 1970s. Paid signature gatherers driven by financial incentive rather than moral conviction replaced volunteers who had once circulated petitions for their causes. The initiative \u201cis very rapidly becoming a tool of the special interests,\u201d Jerry Brown, then the secretary of state, testified at a 1972 state hearing where signature gatherers detailed a range of deceptive practices.\n\nThe last initiative that got on the ballot through the effort of volunteers was a 1990 measure to protect mountain lions. Since then, petition gatherers wielding multiple clipboards have become ubiquitous at shopping malls, outside retail stores and at farmers\u2019 markets. They are paid per signature, rates that fluctuate as high as $6 per name, depending on how many initiatives are in circulation, how soon the petitions must be turned in and how difficult the sell. Signature gatherers who handle multiple initiatives have an incentive to push the ones that pay the most. The bidding wars and campaign high jinks can be fierce. They have included attempts to sabotage petitions by flooding them with false or duplicate names.\n\nAs governor, Mr. Brown has vetoed several recent attempts to amend the process, principally by outlawing a fee-per-signature payment. While he acknowledged the propensity for manipulation, he argued that the per-signature system remains the cheapest. \u201cEliminating this option will drive up the cost of circulating ballot measures, thereby further favoring the wealthiest interests,\u201d he wrote in a veto message.\n\nMr. Brown has had more experience with initiatives than most. In his first campaign for governor in 1974, he piggybacked on a popular initiative he had crafted, the Political Reform Act, which established a commission to to regulate campaign finances, lobbying and ethics. Four years later, he was caught in the swirl of Proposition 13, the tax cut measure that remains the most far-reaching initiative in modern times. Like most elected officials, Mr. Brown opposed Prop 13, but then embraced it enthusiastically when it passed.\n\nSince his return to the governor\u2019s office in 2011, he has mastered the art of using initiatives to further his priorities. He devised and campaigned for measures that raised taxes, created a rainy-day fund and made major changes to the criminal-justice system. He has also amassed funds to fight off attempts to undo policies or hamper his objectives, learning from the experience of Prop 13, when such tactics were not yet in vogue. He has helped fend off ballot challenges to criminal-justice reforms and efforts to block his plans for high-speed rail. This year, he has helped fight a proposition on the November ballot that would repeal a recently enacted gas tax that funds highway repairs.", "(Want to get this briefing by email?

Masc Femme Butch Kween\n\nThere\u2019s a hashtag for everything on Instagram; when you type #gayballet, you will come across men in tights and training shorts, and eventually you might find James Whiteside, most likely bare-chested with a large scratch tattooed on his ribs. Whiteside, 34, is a principal dancer with New York\u2019s American Ballet Theater and, since joining the company in 2012, one of its major stars; critics applaud his power and energy and the depth he brings to his characters. For the choreographer Lar Lubovitch\u2019s 2015 production of \u201cOthello,\u201d Whiteside didn\u2019t want to waste the opportunity of working with a gay collaborator \u2014 his Iago was infused with what he calls \u201cqueer rage.\u201d This month, at New York\u2019s Joyce Theater, Whiteside opened the celebrated choreographer Arthur Pita\u2019s new ballet, \u201cThe Tenant,\u201d based on Roland Topor\u2019s 1964 French novel and Roman Polanski\u2019s film adaptation of the same name, which questions ideas of identity and gender.\n\n\u201cMy personality was maybe something that ABT hadn\u2019t encountered before,\u201d Whiteside says. \u201cI would come in \u2018yaass kween\u2019-ing everyone and doing drag queen walks, and that could have been so easily misconstrued as not taking the work seriously.\u201d But Whiteside takes his work very seriously because he doesn\u2019t want to, as he puts it, go back. Back to his late teens in South Boston when people regularly threw rocks at him and called him the F-word on his way to and from Boston Ballet. \u201cI found myself a target anywhere I went,\u201d he says. Like anyone who\u2019s danced through fire and come out burnished, Whiteside can now laugh at his past and turn it into a personal statement and meta joke on Instagram. In one post, he\u2019s flexing his biceps while wearing a pink bandanna, a black tutu and a tank top that says \u201cMilk\u2019s Gym\u201d (Milk is the drag name of his boyfriend, Daniel Donigan, who appeared on two seasons of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d). Whiteside\u2019s caption: \u201cMasc femme butch kween horse peasant monarch wealthy broke realness.\u201d Then a shrugging-guy emoji.\n\nWhat he hears most from his 171,000 Instagram followers is that he looks like he\u2019s having fun. And he is. Dancing with ABT has been his dream since he was a boy, when he attended a gala and visited the principals\u2019 red-velvet hallway backstage. He loves ballet and wants others to fall in love with it, too, and he hopes his feed will bring more people into the theater. But it bugs him that so much of ballet Instagram \u2014 his own at times, too \u2014 is \u201cdancer thirst trap.\u201d The twerking and the tights and the belts are a misleading representation of the work, the almost inhuman physical effort behind a dancer doing splits in the air. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to understand what we really do from Instagram, where everything has a smile on it and a cigarette in its mouth,\u201d he says. \u201cBallet is one of the most physically demanding things in the world, but you have to seem like you\u2019re just taking a whiz.\u201d\n\nWhiteside has a point. But like any protagonist, he can\u2019t see himself as we do. Before social media, ballet on video \u2014 think of those tame PBS broadcasts \u2014 appealed to a specialized audience. One reason is its perspective: The cameras, way up in the auditorium, show ballet from a limited point of view. But on Instagram, the close-up angles, taped ankles, the veins and arteries flooded with blood, give us ballet as the dancer experiences it. Rather than removing the magic of a darkened theater, this intimacy brings us closer to the my-God-how-does-the-human-body-do-that awe that ballet inspires.\n\nIn one post, we see Whiteside\u2019s backside, naked but for the straps of a well-worn dance belt. But this isn\u2019t just a thirst trap. It\u2019s a hard, strangely shaped, almost gnarled piece of flesh. The caption \u2014 \u201cDancer butt\u201d \u2014 tells us we\u2019re looking at decades of sacrifice knotted up in muscle and skin. It shows us the feat behind the art, reminding us that the foundation of dance is physical strength \u2014 a quality associated with traditional masculinity. Whiteside is an athlete-artist restless with ideas and energy, and Instagram gives him a space arguably bigger than a company\u2019s stage to experiment with what it now means to be a great dancer.", "Most medical professionals categorize travel as a stressful event, even more so for those suffering from autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel, celiac, Hashimoto\u2019s or psoriasis.

But now, he said, \u201ccomedians have dropped the veil.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worried about the country, and they\u2019re going to say they\u2019re worried about the country,\u201d Mr. Carter said.\n\nAnd what\u2019s behind that veil is solidly left of center. \u201cPeople have asked why there isn\u2019t a conservative form of late night comedy,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cI think Fox tried it briefly, but there aren\u2019t enough writers to support it.\u201d\n\nMr. Fallon is perhaps the closest to the old mold. He has always positioned himself as a broadly appealing figure, quicker to engage guests in a round of charades or karaoke than to hurl down any political gauntlet.

But even he has perfected a Trump impersonation, and \u2014 while he\u2019s still more likely to paint Trump as juvenile, rather than as the existential threat that other hosts tend to see him as \u2014 he lampoons the president on a nightly basis.", "Effective discipline involves practicing empathy and \u201cunderstanding how to treat your child in different stages in development to teach them how to cool down when things do get explosive,\u201d said Dr. Vincent J. Palusci, a child abuse pediatrician at Hassenfeld Children\u2019s Hospital at N.Y.U. Langone.\n\nThe academy\u2019s parenting website, HealthyChildren.org, offers tips for disciplining younger and older children. Rewarding positive behavior, using timeouts and establishing a clear relationship between behavior and consequences can all be effective strategies.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just take away spanking,\u201d Dr. Palusci said. \u201cWe have to give parents something to replace it with.\u201d\n\nThe number of parents who spank their children has been on the decline. A 2013 Harris Poll of 2,286 adults surveyed online found 67 percent of parents said they had spanked their children and 33 percent had not. In 1995, however, 80 percent of parents said they had spanked their children while 19 percent said they had not.\n\nAttitudes about spanking are also changing. Although seven in 10 adults in the United States agreed a \u201cgood, hard spanking is sometimes necessary to discipline a child,\u201d according to the 2014 General Social Survey, spanking has become less popular over time.\n\nIn 1970, Fitzhugh Dodson, a clinical psychologist and best-selling author of books on parenting, was quoted in The New York Times as saying that many discipline problems could be solved by using his \u201cpow wow approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pow, followed by his wow,\u201d he explained, demonstrating how he would swat a child\u2019s bottom.\n\n\u201cI know some books say parents shouldn\u2019t spank, but I think it\u2019s a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cA poor mother is left with nowhere to go. She\u2019s mad at the kid, has had it up to the eyebrows with him, and longs to give him a big smack on the behind, but she\u2019s been told she shouldn\u2019t. She should, and it\u2019s good for her, because it releases her tension. And the child definitely prefers it to long parental harangues.\u201d", "Image\n\nBlight draws on new archival material and insights gleaned from a lifetime in the company of his subject to shed light on the orator\u2019s complex relationship with his wife, Anna, and the two white women who came between the couple within the walls of the Douglass family home in Rochester.\n\nThe great man\u2019s vocation as a wandering oracle was possible because Anna, who bore five children (only four lived to adulthood), ran the household with a sure hand, hosting fugitive slaves, far-flung relatives and others who turned up at the front door in need. Anna, whom Blight describes as \u201clargely illiterate,\u201d could be of little help with her husband\u2019s journalism. For that, the charismatic orator called up the British abolitionist Julia Griffiths, who put aside her life and moved in 1849 to be with him in Rochester and to get The North Star off the ground. She enabled Douglass to survive personally and professionally, managing and raising money for the newspaper and for the food that came across the Douglass family table. She helped \u201cto polish a raw genius into a gem and, for a time, managed his emotional health as well as his bank accounts.\u201d Together with her sister, Eliza, Griffiths relieved the Douglasses of an enormous financial burden by purchasing the mortgage of the family home. White Rochester was scandalized when Griffiths moved into the Douglass home, an arrangement that spawned rumors of a romantic link between patron and orator. It is alleged that she moved out when Anna \u201cordered it.\u201d\n\nThat Griffiths loved Douglass is clear on the face of things, but any claim that the two carried on a sexual relationship right under Anna\u2019s nose seems far-fetched. The eccentric German intellectual Ottilie Assing was another matter. She wandered into the Douglasses\u2019 lives in 1856, seeking permission to translate his second autobiography, \u201cMy Bondage and My Freedom,\u201d into German. She remained in the family orbit for nearly three decades, serving as confidante and interlocutor \u2014 and lover. Douglass frequented her rooms in Hoboken, N.J., where the participants of her salon lionized him, validating his rise from slavery into the thinking classes. Assing shielded him when he was on the run from conspiracy charges in connection with John Brown\u2019s raid on Harpers Ferry, when he came within a hairbreadth of being captured and marched to the gallows with his revolutionary friend.\n\nThat Assing was obsessed with the famous orator would have been readily apparent to Anna during the interloper\u2019s frequent intrusion on the family home, where she lived for months at a time. We know nothing of Anna\u2019s feelings on the matter \u2014 but the triangle of Frederick, Anna and the love-struck Ottilie comes through like the plot of an Edith Wharton novel. At different points, Assing referred to Anna as a \u201cveritable beast\u201d who kept her from her beloved Frederick, and as the \u201cborder state\u201d that prevented her from advancing toward her heart\u2019s true goal. As Blight writes, \u201cAlthough Assing sipped tea occasionally with Mrs. Douglass, she held Anna in utter contempt, disrespecting her lack of education and even at times privately denigrating her role as homemaker.\u201d The amorous German lingered in Douglass\u2019s circle year after year, waiting in vain for the divorce that would allow her to \u201cwalk tall as the rightful \u2018Mrs. Douglass.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy the time Anna died in 1882, Assing was bitterly aware that the aging orator intended to marry Helen Pitts, a well-educated white woman in her 40s, who worked for Douglass in the recorder of deeds office in Washington. The nearly 66-year-old Douglass held the plan secret even from his children, with whom he also worked daily, and who seem to have learned of the marriage from press inquiries. He failed to notify his faithful British friend Julia, who received the news secondhand from friends in Rochester. Gracious as usual, she wished the newlyweds well and hoped that the union would give him \u201ctrue happiness\u201d in the evening of his days. Later that year, Assing killed herself in a Paris park \u2014 drinking potassium cyanide \u2014 leaving her beloved a tidy sum in her will.", "Q. Why do I see so many tugboats pushing barges rather than towing them?\n\nA. In terms of power and water resistance, it is more efficient to push rather than pull a barge. But a lot depends on where it happens.\n\nIn some waters, like the Mississippi River, you are likely to see a square-bowed tugboat pushing barges that are tied together. These are single-purpose boats, which only push.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nIn places like New York Harbor, most tugboats have pointed bows. This type can push or tow, and in congested but calm waters, these tugs will generally push barges. Towing provides less navigational control, as the barge may wander from side to side.\n\nIn waters that are less congested and less calm, it is more likely that the traditional pointed-bow tugboat will tow a barge. Pushing in rough waters may be dangerous, because of the inevitable banging between the two vessels.", "NASHVILLE \u2014 Emblazoned on the front page of the website for Vote.org, which was founded in 2008 to increase voter turnout, there\u2019s a quotation from Ronald Reagan: \u201cFor this Nation to remain true to its principles, we cannot allow any American\u2019s vote to be denied, diluted, or defiled. The right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties, and we will not see its luster diminished.\u201d\n\nThe Party of Reagan no longer shares this particular ideal, at least not here in the South. In Tennessee, transparent voter suppression efforts have included an array of tactics:\n\nConfiscating the driver\u2019s licenses of citizens who can\u2019t afford to pay traffic fines. This onerous law prevents the impoverished not only from voting but also from working \u2014 93.4 percent of working Tennesseans need cars to get to their jobs \u2014 and being unable to work prevents them from paying their fines. \u201cSince 2012, at least 250,000 driver\u2019s licenses have been suspended for nonpayment of traffic fines and costs,\u201d according to a class-action lawsuit filed against the state. Last month, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the case, ordering Tennessee to stop the practice of revoking licenses and requiring the state to allow people to apply to get their licenses back. The state is appealing the decision.\n\nEffectively disenfranchising college students. It\u2019s not permissible to mail in a ballot in Tennessee unless you registered to vote in person before an election commission official, or have voted in a previous election. This law makes it extremely difficult for students to vote in national elections, which are, of course, held in November and thus in the middle of a school term. The rules about voting by mail in Tennessee are so complicated that the campaign staff of United States Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat, created a graphic to help explain it. Even the graphic is complicated.\n\nDisqualifying voter registration applications for specious reasons. Shelby County is Tennessee\u2019s largest county. It is also a county where African-Americans are in the majority. Last month, the Memphis branch of the N.A.A.C.P. and the Tennessee Black Voter Project sued the Shelby County Election Commission over a backlog of more than 10,000 voter registration applications that had not yet been processed because, according to election officials, they were incomplete. (The election commission considered an application incomplete even if only the field designating the citizen\u2019s title \u2014 Mr., Ms. or Mrs. \u2014 was left blank.) A Chancery Court judge ordered the commission to allow citizens to complete the forms and vote on Election Day. The Tennessee Supreme Court subsequently ruled that such voters could cast provisional ballots only.", "I\u2019ve often heard people decline the vaccine because they once got flulike symptoms after the injection, or they came down with the flu despite it.\n\nFacts: 1) The vaccine does not, and cannot, cause the flu. Either they were infected before they were immunized or before immunity took hold, or the fever and aches they experienced were side effects of the vaccination, not the flu itself. 2) As currently formulated, the vaccine is far from perfect. In some years, it has been as little as 20 percent effective in preventing the flu, although it may still lessen the severity of the illness and likelihood of complications.\n\nThe biggest problem with flu vaccine is the need to determine months in advance of flu season which of the virus variants to include. The flu virus is a moving target, highly subject to mutations; even the way the vaccine is made \u2014 often involving growing the virus variants in eggs \u2014 can cause them to mutate.\n\nIf the variants included in the vaccine differ from those that are ultimately responsible for seasonal outbreaks, protection is likely to be greatly reduced, which is what happened in the 2004-05 and 2014-15 flu seasons, when vaccine effectiveness was only 10 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Last season\u2019s vaccine was about 36 percent effective.\n\nThere is also a difference in the protection afforded by the same vaccine given to people in different age categories. For example, the vaccine used against flu in 2012-13 had an overall effectiveness of 49 percent, but was only 11 percent effective for people 65 and older. A higher-potency vaccine is now available for older men and women.\n\nThere is now a concerted effort to create a new \u201cuniversal\u201d flu vaccine that would protect against all manner of variants and not require an annual shot. The goal, Dr. Osterholm said, is \u201ca vaccine that can handle many new changes in the virus and that needs to be given only once every five or 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe basic research needed to develop such a vaccine could cost $1 billion a year for the next five to seven years, he estimated. However, Congress allocated a mere $100 million for the coming fiscal year.", "\u201cThe bottom line,\u201d he said, \u201cis that for all of the over-the-counter cough and cold medications, there is limited to no evidence of efficacy for any cold symptoms, particularly in those under 6 years.\u201d\n\nStudies have not shown that cough suppressants help children cough less, or that antihistamines and decongestants help them sleep better. Medicines which can help a child with a runny nose from seasonal allergies won\u2019t help that same child when it\u2019s a cold virus making the nose drip; the underlying mechanisms are different.\n\nEven for older children and adolescents, Dr. Paul said, the evidence of efficacy is not strong for most of the ingredients in cough and cold medications, and there is always the danger of side effects, particularly when the medicines are taken in too-large doses, which can happen because there are so many different preparations, with so many different combinations of drugs.\n\nDr. Yin is working on a project funded by the F.D.A. to improve the labeling and dosing instructions on children\u2019s cough and cold medications; so far, she said, the research has shown that parents in the study population are confused about the intended age ranges of the medicines, about the active ingredients, and about dosing. Many of these preparations contain several different drugs, including a cough suppressant, a decongestant, an antihistamine and a medicine for pain and fever.\n\n\u201cIn my own practice, I reassure them, I check the child, I make sure I\u2019ve covered the ears, the lungs, the throat,\u201d Dr. van Driel said. \u201cI reassure the parent, this is a cold, a cold is a self-limiting disease, we have capable immune systems that will take care of it, it will take about a week.\u201d People need to feel confident in their bodies, she said, instead of relying on medicines. \u201cI would tell them, there\u2019s not a lot we know that helps. Don\u2019t give him anything you might give your older child or take yourself,\u201d said Dr. van Driel.\n\nAnd of course, we always tell parents what to watch out for, symptoms that might suggest that something more than a cold is going on. Any respiratory difficulty in a child has to be taken seriously, so a baby who is breathing too fast or a child who is working harder than normal to breathe should be checked out. High fevers are concerning, as are any of the signs of influenza, such as shaking, chills and body aches; influenza in children can be treated with antiviral drugs \u2014 and prevented with flu shots.", "Unesco estimates that women make up 29 percent of the worldwide science work force.\n\nBut there are also data to support the value of peer review. A 1994 study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, reviewed the quality of papers submitted to the journal before and after the peer review and editorial system. Researchers used a tool that assessed the manuscript\u2019s quality on 34 items, and their work showed that all but one got better. The biggest improvements were in the discussion of a study\u2019s limitations, its generalizations, its use of confidence intervals and the tone of the conclusions. Probably none of these would have occurred without the nudge of peer review.\n\nIdeas for Improving Peer Review\n\nHow then to improve the existing system?\n\nFor starters, more formal training might improve quality and speed. Given how hard it is to recruit good reviewers, journal editors could consider better incentives, such as paying reviewers for their time. The unpaid costs of peer review were estimated at 1.9 billion pounds (almost $3.5 billion) in 2008. Or journals could offer, without promise of acceptance, quicker turnaround for a reviewer\u2019s future papers. Academia might offer more formal recognition for review work as well.\n\nA number of journals have moved toward fully blinded reviews, in which reviewers don\u2019t know the authors or institutions of papers they\u2019re judging. This could eliminate some biases. It\u2019s hard to do this, though, because papers often refer to prior work or to where the research occurred. It also doesn\u2019t solve the relative lack of women in the editorial and review process in general.\n\nOne way to detect problems with research earlier would be to let researchers post manuscripts online before submission, for public judgment before formal peer review. This is already common in some sciences, such as physics. Medical journals would probably re sist this, however, because it could reduce their ability to get press and attention once the research was fully published.\n\nA significant improvement would require a change in attitude. Too often, we think that once a paper gets through peer review, it\u2019s \u201ctruth.\u201d We\u2019d do better to accept that everything, even published research, needs to be reconsidered as new evidence comes to light, and subjected to more thorough post-publication review.\n\nAs an author of papers, and as a writer who comments on papers in the news media, I\u2019ve seen how the peer review process can fail. But I\u2019m also an editor at the journal JAMA Pediatrics. There, as at many journals, a paper\u2019s first gatekeeper is an editor. Those getting past that hurdle are sent out to a few experts in the field who are asked to read and offer their views to the editor. This informs what might happen next: acceptance, rejection or a chance to respond to reviewer comments before a decision is made.\n\nEach week we meet by teleconference to discuss papers we are considering for publication. We talk about the reviews, and ultimately decide what few studies make the cut. I\u2019m always impressed by the quality of the discussion and the seriousness with which people take their charge. We also follow papers we turn down to see if we made mistakes in deciding to reject. We use that data to review and improve our process. I\u2019m sure other journals do the same. And I\u2019m sure we make our share of bad calls, as other journals do.\n\nPeer review is still better than the alternatives. It might make more sense, though, to see it (and publication) as steps on the road to assurance, not a final stamp of approval.", "Few companies seriously contemplated severing their contracts with Saudi clients, however. At The New York Times\u2019s DealBook conference last week, Laurence D. Fink of the investment management giant BlackRock said that it was a \u201chard decision\u201d to withdraw from the Saudi conference. But he unapologetically defended keeping the Saudi government as a client, saying that doing business there was \u201cnot something I\u2019m ashamed of.\u201d\n\nAt issue are the billions of dollars that Saudi Arabia has spread around the corporate world. The country has pledged to buy nearly $110 billion worth of arms from the United States, though so far it has spent only a fraction of that. Business from Saudi Arabia constitutes at least 15 percent of the revenue of BAE Systems, the British defense contractor. And consulting firms have courted the Saudi government for years, earning hundreds of millions in fees \u2014 to the point that the country\u2019s planning ministry has been nicknamed the \u201cMinistry of McKinsey.\u201d\n\nFor SoftBank in particular, Saudi Arabia is a crucial part of its future.\n\nThe company, a Japanese internet, energy and financial conglomerate, has increasingly staked its future on its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund.

N.Y.U., in financial trouble in the 1970s, packed up and left, consolidating its operations around Washington Square. New York State helped out by arranging for the City University of New York to buy the campus for $62 million and turn it over to Bronx Community College, a far different kind of institution. Minorities make up 96 percent of the students at Bronx Community, according to the website Community College Review, and the majority is Hispanic. But the Hall is short on minorities and women.\n\nThe faces on the statues do not show it, but the Hall has more problems than Emerson\u2019s eye. The masonry is cracked in places and crumbling in others, and, as the foundation put it, \u201cMany statues have deep stains from biological contaminants.\u201d That is a delicate way of referring to bird droppings.\n\nThe foundation also warns that runoff from copper in the roof has discolored the bronze tablets below the statues. The template for the tablets was the work of Louis Comfort Tiffany, the Art Nouveau genius who was the first designated design director of the jewelry store his father had started.\n\nThe foundation said the cost of repairs has been estimated at $12 million, too high a price for Bronx Community College. The most urgent work would cost $1.2 million, the foundation said.\n\n\u201cThese repairs are beyond a public college\u2019s ability to afford,\u201d said Richard F. Ginsberg, an interim assistant vice president of Bronx Community, adding that less than 10 percent of the college\u2019s budget goes toward capital projects, a category that includes equipment for the classrooms, as well as utilities and maintenance. Mr. Ginsberg said Bronx Community has a foundation that hopes to raise money to preserve the Hall.\n\nThe architect Samuel G. White, who is involved in efforts to evaluate and renovate the library adjacent to the Hall, said the Hall of Fame was \u201can afterthought\u201d \u2014 and, speaking of afterthoughts, this is probably the moment to note that his great-grandfather designed the Hall, the library and the rest of the campus for N.Y.U. His great-grandfather was Stanford White, who was famous as an architect and infamous for an affair with a woman who later married a jealous industrialist named Harry K. Thaw. Thaw shot him to death in a building White had designed, Madison Square Garden.\n\nAs for the Hall, Mr. White said the original plan called for a semicircular museum behind the library \u2014 \u201ca 19th-century cabinet of curiosities, with paintings and Indian arrowheads and a giant piece of coral they still have.\u201d", "The emphasis on a wide range of possible outcomes isn\u2019t just a matter of hedging by pollsters and analysts after the shock of 2016, when Mr. Trump beat long odds. The uncertainty reflects the sparse data available and the unusually large number of competitive contests. In dozens of key districts, no more than a few polls have been done, making it hard to be confident whether (and where) Democratic or Republican candidates might hold a lead.\n\nFinal House polls have historically been less accurate than polls of statewide contests and presidential races. On average, House polls differ from final election results by around eight percentage points. These polls tend to have relatively small sample sizes, increasing the margin of error, and voters tend to be less familiar with House candidates, meaning more \u201cundecideds\u201d until late in the race.\n\nDemocrats hope that these common sources of polling error might break their way this time.\n\nTurnout is always uncertain, but it is more variable in lower-turnout elections, like a midterm, when even modest shifts in enthusiasm can transform the electorate. It is a particularly challenging question this year, in part because the turnout in recent midterm elections has been so low and so Republican.\n\nThis year\u2019s early vote tallies already make it clear that the turnout will greatly exceed that of four years ago, but it is far less clear how that will translate to actual votes. It is equally unclear whether pollsters have been assuming the hi gh-turnout, more Democratic electorate implied by early voting and the turnout in the special and general elections since Mr. Trump became president.\n\nOver the last few weeks, the share of voters indicating that they\u2019re \u201calmost certain\u201d to vote has increased by 10 points in Times/Siena polls, from 66 percent to 76 percent of the likely electorate.\n\nIn a few cases, the turnout in early voting has shown some polls were off in their projection of who will vote. Early voting in several Texas counties has already surpassed the projected electorate of a Times/Siena poll from early October, and the Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke seems likely to benefit from the higher turnout. A Monmouth poll of California\u2019s 48th District in coastal Orange County showed the Republican incumbent, Dana Rohrabacher, leading by two points with an electorate in which registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats by 18 points. The actual Republican advantage in early voting is down to 12 points and continues to drop as turnout increases.\n\nThe final Times/Siena poll of California\u2019s 48th shows the Democrat Harley Rouda leading Mr. Rohrabacher narrowly with an electorate where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by 10 points, an indicator of the extent that Republicans are struggling in the wealthy suburban bastions of 20th century conservatism.", "Major television networks and Facebook have taken the unusual step of rejecting an inflammatory ad by President Trump\u2019s political team that effectively closes a fiercely fought midterm campaign with a message portraying immigrants as a violent threat.\n\nThe 30-second political spot, which mirrors the president\u2019s apocalyptic warnings about a caravan of asylum seekers in Mexico, was widely denounced as racist and misleading after Mr. Trump shared a longer version of it last week.\n\nNBC and Facebook, both of which had run the ad over the weekend, reversed course after a backlash on Monday and announced that the commercial would be removed, saying it fell short of their in-house advertising standards. CNN had refused to air the ad from the start, calling it \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nEven Fox News, which has made warnings about the migrant caravan a staple of its prime time coverage of the midterms, felt compelled to distance itself from the ad.

The notion of a veteran singling himself or herself out for special treatment, some critics said, was distinctly un-Australian. Others described it as something even worse: an Americanism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very American thing to do.

As the crowd roars and defenders rise to celebrate, the fallen passer rolls onto his back and looks up at the first person he sees standing over him: a referee.\n\nWhat does the quarterback say?\n\n\u201cLying there, their reaction sometimes would be, \u2018Man, there\u2019s no way I could feel this terrible after a legal hit,\u2019\u201d said Gene Steratore, a longtime N.F.L. referee who retired in June.\n\nPostponing a rules debate, Steratore would instead ask: \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\n\nThe exchange is just one example of the constant, if hidden, interplay between players and officials, a largely overlooked dialogue reserved for the few permitted to step onto an N.F.L. field.\n\n\u201cWhat happens out there is two human beings talking like any other two people would,\u201d said Steratore, now a sports rules analyst for CBS. \u201cWhy should the normal things in life stop just because it\u2019s the middle of an N.F.L. game?\u201d", "Then, in 2016, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced that all unsafe informal settlements would be eliminated within two years. Maspero Triangle is among the most visibly contested, partly because of its location and heritage status, and partly because only about one-third of it, according to several urbanists I spoke to, might have been fairly called unsafe. It was an area I walked or drove through every day for years, when I worked at a local weekly paper in a bordering neighborhood; the Maspero bakery, the corner fruit stand, the Italian club and the historic watch shop Hinhayat were all places I frequented.\n\nOne can\u2019t deny that parts of the city are run down, or that haphazard additions on buildings can be unsafe. But the organic way in which such districts developed, mixing the historic and the makeshift, gives them a unique cultural value. The heritage they represent is tangible, in the form of buildings and trees, and intangible, by way of customs and characters.\n\nResidents in Maspero Triangle would exchange news and recipes across balconies, and passed on disappearing skills like clock repairing from one generation to the next. The neighborhood held on to age-old traditions: During Ramadan, musaharati walked the narrow streets at dawn hollering to observing Muslims to rise for their last meal before the fast. The oral history of these alleyways spans several political eras. When the residents of Maspero Triangle leave, all of this will disappear.\n\nMaspero residents were offered 60,000 Egyptian pounds (about $3,350) per room, a relocation fee of 40,000 Egyptian pounds (about $2,200) and either rent-subsidized housing in Asmarat, a low-income suburb in the desert, or the chance to return to Maspero once it is rebuilt \u2014 a possibility that few of them believe in.", "In other words \u2014 and, really, this is kind of a bummer \u2014 you\u2019re a better human lie detector when you\u2019re not happy.\n\n[Like what you\u2019re reading?

Feeling happy can decrease, and feeling bad can increase, our accuracy as eyewitnesses, our ability to communicate strategically (like when we\u2019re trying to persuade), and our likelihood to avoid errors in judgment, according to pair of studies, one of which found that happiness can even blind us to the fact that we have these emotion-induced impairments.\n\nSo why is it that feeling bad can be so good? Blame evolution.\n\n\u201cThere is a good reason that human beings evolved the ability to experience negative emotions: In measured amounts, they protect us from harm and help us to be successful,\u201d according to Psychology Today. It added, \u201cAncient humans who were capable of experiencing suspicion, fear, anxiety and even anger would have been less likely to place themselves in harmful situations or would have been better able to navigate their way out of them than those not susceptible to these feelings.\u201d\n\nThe lesson here, friends, is this: The way to improve your life is always feeling bad.\n\nKidding! But what this research does mean is that you should be aware of your emotions and feelings \u2014 and how they\u2019re influencing you \u2014 when making big decisions or having important conversations.

That agreement had removed many U.S. and other economic sanctions from Iran in return for Tehran's commitment to curtail its nuclear program.", "SHANGHAI \u2014 Faced with mounting American tariffs that could slow China\u2019s already weakened economy, President Xi Jinping is pressing the case to the rest of the world that China can be a positive force for global trade.\n\nThe challenge will be convincing the world he means it.\n\nMr. Xi, the country\u2019s top leader, on Monday kicked off a six-day expo intended to show China as a big buyer of foreign goods.

Vinnie has grown as a person throughout this period, as his scene with his ex-wife and kids demonstrates. He wants to live a normal life, with \u201crug rats\u201d scurrying in the backyard, and he seems to have the capacity now to appreciate domesticity more than he did in his marriage. Abby was once another fling to him, a beddable college dropout, but now she is ambitious and independent-minded, and it has made him a more caring and conscientious person on balance. But he can\u2019t transcend the Faustian bargain he has struck for himself.\n\nThe best Vinnie can do now is try to hold himself, and his people, to a higher standard. When Bobby comes to him freaked out about Tommy\u2019s having ordered one of their guys, Black Frankie, to kill another one of their guys, Vinnie is less alarmed over that than over Bobby\u2019s moral failings. For one, Bobby and Frankie bludgeoned C.C. in the middle of the parlor, and he hasn\u2019t seemed to give it much thought. Then, while burying another young woman\u2019s body, Vinnie discovers that the underage girl they buried in the same graveyard \u2014 the one who died in the parlor fire \u2014 still has no headstone.\n\nThis was the girl who got a parlor job because Bobby wink-winked about her age, lost her life because of gross negligence and whose remains went unclaimed by a father who was ashamed of her. For Bobby not to give her a tombstone is unconscionable. (\u201cWe\u2019re better than this Bobby,\u201d says Vinnie. \u201cWe can be better.\u201d) They have reason to worry about dying, too, but only Vinnie seems worried about being condemned.\n\n\u201cInside the Pretend\u201d also deals with the fallout of two major deaths, C.C.\u2019s and Dorothy\u2019s, which reverberate in contrasting ways through the community. No one cares much about C.C. other than Lori, who is reduced to coke-fueled catatonia over the possibility that he could pop up anywhere and terrorize her. When she finally discovers the truth, Emily Meade\u2019s performance is a tour de force: crushed by the loss of a man who controlled every aspect of her life, elated to no longer live in fear. The title of the episode comes from Darlene\u2019s final words to Larry as she steps out of his life forever. She can leave because she finally recognized that he was a pretend-pimp, acting the part as persuasively as he played the wolf in \u201cRed Hot.\u201d But C.C. was never a pretend pimp. He was the real thing, vicious and manipulative to the core, and the moment Lori\u2019s grief curls into a smile, he is vanquished.\n\nTo keep Dorothy\u2019s death off screen is an ingenious touch because she is discovered like any other body on the streets, another sex worker who has been rounded up and released dozens of times by the police. In that respect, it\u2019s as if she had never left C.C. behind at all, having met the fate that once seemed likely to catch up with her as a sex worker. More important, though, is that seeing Dorothy\u2019s murder would also have meant seeing her killer, which isn\u2019t as powerful as the idea that all of the pimps are culpable in her death. It\u2019s not this specific act that Simon is emphasizing, but the collective will of these men to erase the life of a woman who was getting in the way of their bottom line.", "It was a concern that we start saying one thing and people are anticipating a death, and we don\u2019t give them that.

No matter how you build your life to avoid it, her performance suggests, the day will come when your black son is in danger. Perhaps all of your decoys, all of your success, will make that day come more surely.\n\nThis is a despairing message in a despairing play, and it renders the actual plot almost secondary. Indeed, after the first few minutes we don\u2019t learn much more about what\u2019s happened to Jamal until the final curtain. In between, the dispensing of calibrated micro-doses of information can seem manipulative; much of it could as easily be revealed earlier.\n\nBut Mr. Demos-Brown, who is white, is interested in the procedural details only as a tensioning device. His real aim, evidently, is to shift the narrative about police and young black men from individual cases to universal feelings. It would be hard for any parent not to be harrowed by the terror both Kendra and Scott express, in their own ways, about the disappearance of their child. The play\u2019s title clearly expresses that generalizing intention.\n\nThis puts enormous pressure on the production to keep the personal material in focus, lest the whole thing tip into polemics. Though I could quibble with some of the staging, which sometimes seems to get stuck behind furniture, this is the director Kenny Leon\u2019s best work to date: incisive and breakneck. If the police station set by Derek McLane is a bit grand in scale, it fills the Booth nicely and emphasizes Kendra\u2019s powerlessness. And for the first time I can recall, a thunderstorm recreated onstage actually seems like a thunderstorm instead of a comment.\n\nThe cast manages a similar feat of naturalism: These are big but nuanced performances. Mr. Pasquale, for once ideally cast, fully inhabits Scott\u2019s contraption of a personality, easygoing for about an inch and chaotic underneath. (Listen, if you can, for his devastating last lines.) Mr. Jordan, naturally ingratiating onstage, smartly uses that ingratiation to suggest a character who has never had to dig any deeper.

More than just a shift in geography, however, Season 4 represents a new age for Claire and Jamie. Their dynamic feels settled, maybe for the first time. It\u2019s a novel experience to watch them discuss eight-year plans and give presents they assume they\u2019ll live long enough to use. Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan are well-suited to this, giving Claire and Jamie a gentle married-couple telepathy that neatly sketches the state of their relationship.\n\nBut of course, wherever Jamie goes a villain is sure to follow, and this season we get Stephen Bonnet (Ed Speleers), a walking warning about \u2026 something. He is clever and intense and aiming for charming. But when Claire and Jamie help him escape the noose, they unleash a monster. As if to prove it, he and gang of pirates rob their river boat, complete with beatings, a throat-cutting, and some distinctly sexual assault on Claire.\n\nBecause this is \u201cOutlander,\u201d we know Bonnet\u2019s presence in their lives won\u2019t end with one raid \u2014 and the uncanny valley of this series\u2019s very small world is that by now, Claire and Jamie sort of know that, too. Does that mean they shouldn\u2019t have helped him? Does it mean they shouldn\u2019t help any desperate types who seem unsavory? What are the limits of mercy? These are rough problems to encounter so soon in the season, and they make for a grim note on which to end this week\u2019s premiere.\n\n[Need a refresher on where Season 3 of \u201cOutlander\u201d left off? Here\u2019s what to remember.]\n\nIn fact, despite new beginnings, there\u2019s a sense of gloom all over. The memorial song in the pub, a melancholy echo of waulking the wool in Season 1, hints at Claire\u2019s eternally unsettled place in this world: She\u2019s an outsider in a way Jamie isn\u2019t, and knowing the broad strokes of the future makes it only harder during moments like these. Also, their found family is breaking to pieces: Gavin is hanged, Lesley is murdered, Fergus and Marsali stay in Wilmington. And beyond visiting Riverrun, Jamie, Claire and Ian still don\u2019t quite know where they\u2019re going.", "In a meeting with reporters in September in New York, Mr. Rouhani declared that \u201cthe United States is not capable of bringing our oil exports to zero,\u201d and suggested that he would brush off the sanctions. Whether that restraint continues, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in New York last month, is \u201cdependent on a series of future judgments.\u201d\n\nAnother one of Mr. Trump\u2019s bets is also paying off: While governments are declaring that they will stick with Iran while it sticks with the deal, companies are fleeing. Boeing has canceled a $20 billion deal struck after the 2015 nuclear agreement to deliver aircraft to Iran\u2019s decrepit fleet; the French oil giant Total S.A. has said it will not go through with a lucrative contract to develop oil fields; and Maersk, the shipping giant, is stopping its movement of Iranian goods.\n\nThe contrast with three years ago is stark: Mr. Kerry traveled to Europe after the deal was reached to urge European companies to engage with Iran so that the nation would feel the benefits of giving up 97 percent of its uranium stockpile and dismantling uranium and plutonium production facilities.\n\nBut even with the sanctions fully in place on Monday, it is far from clear that Iran will move to renegotiate the deal with the United States. Mr. Rouhani insisted during his visit to New York that the United States would first have to come back into compliance with the nuclear deal.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump will have to navigate two other major hurdles. The first is justifying the growing pressure on Iran when the major ally it is depending on to contain that country, Saudi Arabia, is admitting that a 15-member hit squad killed the dissident Jamal Khashoggi and so far refusing to stop its bombing in Yemen.\n\nMr. Pompeo has vowed to follow the Khashoggi investigation wherever it goes, but American diplomats note that he has refused to call the killing an act of terrorism. Iran gets different treatment: On Sunday, Mr. Pompeo accused Iran of plotting assassinations in Europe as part of his claim that the country is the largest exporter of terrorism.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s biggest long-term challenge may be explaining how he can invoke new sanctions on Iran \u2014 which the International Atomic Energy Agency has declared is abiding by its commitments to halt nuclear production \u2014 while declaring that North Korea is \u201cno longer a nuclear threat.\u201d\n\nUnlike Iran, the North already has nuclear weapons, and by the account of American intelligence agencies is continuing to produce them.", "\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u201c\u660e\u786e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86CFC-11\u5728\uff08\u4e2d\u56fd\uff09\u4e09\u5bb6\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u201d\uff0cEIA\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u8bf4\u3002\u8be5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6253\u7b97\u672c\u5468\u5728\u5384\u74dc\u591a\u5c14\u9996\u90fd\u57fa\u591a\u63d0\u4ea4\u8fd9\u4efd\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u8fd1200\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6b63\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u51fa\u5e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u81ed\u6c27\u5c42\u4fee\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\u73b0\u72b6\u7684\u300a\u8499\u7279\u5229\u5c14\u8bae\u5b9a\u4e66\u300b\u4f1a\u8bae\u3002\n\n\u73af\u5883\u8c03\u67e5\u7f72\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u963f\u7ef4\u666e\u8428\u00b7\u9a6c\u54c8\u5e15\u7279\u62c9(Avipsa Mahapatra)\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e2d\u56fd\u5f53\u5c40\u5e94\u8be5\u5bf9\u76d1\u7ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u5f7b\u5e95\u7684\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u8ba9\u5730\u4e0b\u7684CFC-11\u751f\u4ea7\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u5979\u5728\u4e00\u5c01\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5199\u9053\uff0c\u201c\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u53d6\u7f14\u4e00\u4e9b\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u975e\u6cd5\u4f01\u4e1a\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u533a\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u201d\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6709\u5173CFC-11\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u770b\u6765\u4ecd\u5c1a\u9700\u65f6\u65e5\u3002\n\n\u4e2d\u56fd\u5b98\u5458\u66fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u91c7\u53d6\u6709\u529b\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u90a3\u4e9b\u975e\u6cd5\u5316\u5de5\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u58f0\u79f0\uff0c\u6240\u6d89\u53ca\u7684CFC-11\u6392\u653e\u91cf\u975e\u5e38\u4e4b\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u90fd\u6765\u81ea\u90a3\u4e9b\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\n\n\u201c\u5c31\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u660e\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u5fc5\u987b\u9996\u5148\u5f3a\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8c1c\u56e2\u6709\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u201d\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u73af\u5883\u89c4\u5212\u7f72\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u57fa\u601d\u00b7\u97e6\u52d2(Keith Weller)\u8bf4\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u6784\u5e2e\u52a9\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6709\u5173\u81ed\u6c27\u5c42\u7684\u8c08\u5224\u3002\n\nCFC-11\u4e4b\u8c1c\u6709\u7740\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u81ed\u6c27\u5c42\u66fe\u7ecf\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u88ab\u7981\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u5377\u571f\u91cd\u6765\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u73af\u4fdd\u534f\u5b9a\u4e4b\u4e00\u6ca1\u6709\u5f97\u5230\u9075\u5b88\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u8ba9\u81ed\u6c27\u5c42\u7684\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u51cf\u6162\u3002", "In 2016, Mr. Miller began serving as a warm-up act for the president at his rallies, supplying a hypercharged, more polished version of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration talk.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen what it does to living standards, you\u2019ve seen what it does to wages, you see what it does in terms of transnational cartels,\u201d Mr. Miller warned at a rally in Texas in June 2016. \u201cYou have seen the heartbreak, you have seen the heartache, you have seen the needless death.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody \u2014 everybody \u2014 who is trying to stop Donald J.

Bannon, then the chief strategist in the White House, had pushed through a travel ban targeting Muslim countries, that the president\u2019s powers \u201cwill not be questioned.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Miller is not the only person around Mr. Trump who has seen the immigration debate as having political value. With Mr. Trump\u2019s grip on his party tightening in the past year, he has pulled many Republicans toward his and Mr. Miller\u2019s views on policies they might not have supported before, such as reductions to legal immigration.\n\nOther advisers saw the issue gaining traction beyond the Republican base in the years before the 2016 election, particularly in relation to the economy.

He has relied on friendly media to echo his message and smear opponents. He has stocked the courts with allies. He has overseen rampant corruption. He has cozied up to Putin. To justify his rule, Orb\u00e1n has cited external threats \u2014 especially Muslim immigrants and George Soros, the Jewish Hungarian-born investor \u2014 and said that his party is the only one that represents the real people.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar?\n\nI cannot imagine the United States or a Western European country turning into Russia or China.

Steve Bannon has praised him as the world\u2019s most significant politician.\n\nMost alarming, the Republican Party has shown multiple signs of early Orb\u00e1nism. No, the party is not as bad as Fidesz, and, yes, American democracy remains much healthier than the Hungarian version. But the parallels are there for anyone willing to see them: Like Orb\u00e1n, Republican leaders have repeatedly been willing to change the rules and customs of democracy for the sake of raw power.", "Voters in New York City will want to turn over their ballots on Tuesday. When they do, they\u2019ll find three proposed changes to the City Charter. All three ballot measures are the result of a charter commission put together by Mayor Bill de Blasio to strengthen the city\u2019s well-regarded campaign finance system and increase the city\u2019s dismal voter participation rates.\n\nThough these are good goals, some of the proposals are flawed.\n\nBallot Proposal 1: Yes\n\nThe first proposal would lower limits for contributions to candidates who participate in the campaign finance system, while increasing the funding match given for candidates in the program. Its goal is to boost the impact of smaller donations, to pave the way for more competition in the city\u2019s elections. The contribution limit for citywide candidates would be lowered to $2,000 from $5,100. Matching funds would increase under the proposal, to an 8-1 match from a 6-1 match now.\n\nCombined, these changes would be likely to help blunt the impact of large donations, and encourage more candidates to run for office.\n\nThe new rules wouldn\u2019t become binding until 2022. Some critics of the proposal have said making the new rules optional for candidates running in the city\u2019s 2021 elections \u2014 in which voters will choose a new mayor and a plethora of new City Council members \u2014 is a reason to vote against the initiative.

They repeat his tweets. They parrot what he says in speeches. Their views on taxes, immigration and the news media are, word-for-word, his views on taxes, immigration and the news media \u2014 as endlessly repeated by Fox News.\n\nOutside the Trump bubble, the president is fact-checked, scorned, doubted or challenged. His words \u2014 and there are many of them most days \u2014 appear to have lost their ability to persuade moderates and independents. To his critics, Mr. Trump is a liar and a fraud who is cheapening the office he holds and threatening the fabric of the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nBut inside the bubble, it is different. Inside, supporters share Mr. Trump\u2019s view that men are the aggrieved gender. Inside, they vent their fury at Democrats and the news media using the president\u2019s incendiary language. Inside, they harbor Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories and echo his dark fear of immigrants.\n\nLike Mr. Trump, the president\u2019s most fervent supporters are not swayed by facts they consider inconvenient. Mr. Trump tells them the economy is the best the country has ever had, and they believe him, even if their communities are still struggling. The attacks on Mr. Trump only reinforce what they believe: He is on their side, no matter what.", "Mr. Wofford has promised to prosecute the corruption that has plagued Albany, including within the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But he seems unenthusiastic about challenging financial impropriety on Wall Street, an important focus for the office in recent years, and he appears less willing than Ms. James to challenge the policy excesses of President Trump, whom he supports. The Trump administration has abandoned the federal government\u2019s regulatory role, enacting policies on the environment, immigration and reproductive rights that hurt New Yorkers, and the president himself has scorned the rule of law. The state needs an attorney general who embraces the full responsibilities of the office.\n\nMs. James has frequently said that she has worked for the powerless while Mr. Wofford has worked for the powerful. It\u2019s an easy political slogan. It\u2019s also true. And since Ms. James has pledged to use the office\u2019s powers vigorously, we endorse her for attorney general.\n\nShe has a lengthy record of defending New Yorkers from special interests, beginning with her earliest work as an attorney for the Legal Aid Society. From 1999 to 2001, she led the state attorney general\u2019s Brooklyn office under Eliot Spitzer, enforcing environmental laws and investigating predatory lenders. In 2003, Ms. James was elected to the City Council, where she waged a vocal campaign against Bloomberg administration development policies she said were pricing out low and moderate-income New Yorkers. She also challenged the Bloomberg administration on the policing policy known as stop and frisk. As public advocate since 2014, she has sometimes been overzealous in her use of lawsuits to address what she sees as inequities in government. Still, her efforts have aimed at using the true power of her office \u2014 the bully pulpit \u2014 for good, especially when it comes to tenants\u2019 rights and the needs of vulnerable children.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, we picked Zephyr Teachout over Ms. James. Ms. Teachout is an evangelist for ethics, and rooting out corruption is a central challenge for the next state attorney general. In her primary campaign, Ms. James presented herself as part of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team and accepted his fund-raising, acts that raised doubts about her independence.\n\nBut Ms. James has promised to push for a law that would allow her to pursue prosecutions without first getting approval from the governor and the Legislature. This would be important if the office is to be truly independent in fighting corruption. She has also wisely said she would ask the highly experienced and capable Barbara Underwood to stay with the office. Ms. Underwood has been acting attorney general since Eric Schneiderman resigned after he was accused of abusing women he dated."]
