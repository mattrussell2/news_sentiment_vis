["After the deadly and fast-growing wildfire began to threaten his hometown, Paradise, Calif., on Thursday, Al Silva got in his four-door Buick sedan and fled west.\n\nHis family made contact with the 91-year-old on Thursday night, when he was at a parking lot in Chico, Calif., Mari Irby, Mr. Silva\u2019s great-niece, said.\n\nAnd then, silence.\n\nFor nearly two days, Mr. Silva\u2019s family called shelters, hospitals and filed a missing persons report with the police, Ms. Irby said. She posted a plea on Twitter for help. She said Mr. Silva had left his cellphone in his home, which was almost certainly destroyed.\n\n\u201cWhat everybody is trying to figure out is: Would he have gone back to try to get stuff?

An entire town in the Sierra was nearly erased this week by the most destructive fire in California history. At least 29 people were killed there, and more than 6,400 homes were destroyed. In Malibu and other cities in the hills west of Los Angeles, residents fled their homes \u2014 mansions and modest ranch houses alike.\n\nWildfires have long been a fixture of the California experience. But not like this.", "PARADISE, Calif. \u2014 Rex Stewart was broke when he landed in Paradise, Calif., more than 40 years ago. But he found work as a carpenter, helping build parts of this mostly modest town of retirees and commuters tucked away in the Sierra Nevada foothills.\n\nOn Saturday, after escaping what is now the most destructive and one of the deadliest fires in California history, he stood outside an evacuation shelter with no more to his name than the coat he had on and a winter cap with a peace symbol on it.\n\n\u201cParadise is gone,\u201d Mr. Stewart, 66, said, pulling on a cigarette. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to go back to.\u201d\n\nFires continue to rage on both ends of California, spreading with breakneck speed and displacing hundreds of thousands of people in a state where a once-seasonal worry has become a near-constant terror. At least 23 are dead in the so-called Camp Fire, about 100 miles north of Sacramento, and two others have died in fires near Los Angeles.\n\nWith the discovery of 14 more bodies on Saturday, the Camp Fire surpassed the death toll in last year\u2019s Tubbs Fire, which killed 22 people and was the third-deadliest fire in the state\u2019s history until now.

Put another way, women earn on average 86.3 percent of what men do.", "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump will bestow the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian award, this coming week on an eclectic mix of conservative political figures and cultural and athletic luminaries, including Elvis Presley and Babe Ruth.\n\nAmong those to be recognized at a ceremony on Friday are Miriam Adelson, the Las Vegas physician and prominent Republican donor; Senator Orrin G.

Nor do they reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events, a composite of heart attacks, strokes and deaths from cardiovascular disease. The trial is of the kind considered the gold standard in medicine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, but there have always been such high expectations that vitamin D can do all these different things,\u201d said Dr. Clifford J. Rosen of the Maine Medical Center Research Institute in Scarborough, who was a co-author of an editorial on the studies in The New England Journal of Medicine. He said doctors had engaged in \u201cmagical thinking about vitamin D,\u201d often testing their patients\u2019 blood levels and advising them to take supplements.\n\n\u201cIn terms of preventing cancer, I think the door is closed. I don\u2019t think there is anything there,\u201d Dr. Rosen said. The study also showed that omega-3 fatty acid supplements do not reduce major cardiovascular events or cancer, \u201cperiod,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what people should take home with them.\u201d", "Democracy was also challenged by the deep hatreds stirred up by four years of total war. Many Germans were not ready to absorb the news of armistice, after years of propaganda about inevitable victory. One soldier\u2019s reaction was visceral: In a hospital in Pomerania , Adolf Hitler wept when he heard about \u201cthe monstrous event\u201d and became so distraught that he temporarily lost his eyesight (\u201ceverything went black before my eyes,\u201d he wrote). Ominously, he resolved to \u201cgo into politics.\u201d It would be a politics of blame, castigating Jews and leftists for the defeat. In 1940, he forced the French to surrender in the same railroad car.\n\nIn America, too, democracy was a challenging word to live up to. All Americans had contributed to victory, including African-American soldiers, women working on the home front and recent immigrants who volunteered for service in every way they could. They were in no mood to accept second-class citizenship. W.E.B. Du Bois wrote: \u201cMake way for democracy! We saved it in France, and by the Great Jehovah, we will save it in the United States of America .\u201d That was not exactly what Wilson had in mind. Around the same day as the armistice, a young African-American named William Bird was lynched in Sheffield, Ala.\n\nIn other ways we live with the failures as well as the successes of 1918. Earlier that fall , Wilson wrote to an Arizona senator, Henry Ashurst, that he was working with the future in mind: \u201c I am now playing for 100 years hence. \u201d He would be dismayed at all the ways in which our world resembles his.\n\nIn some ways, it is worse. A recent Pew Poll showed a rapid decline in admiration for the United States. For 12 years in a row, according to Freedom House, democracy has been on the wane. In the Middle East, Ottoman memories are back, feeding the sultanic ambitions of Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In Russia, Vladimir Putin revisits the past in his own curious way, merging Soviet nostalgia with the czar\u2019s role as the defender of the Russian Orthodox Church. It will be surreal to see him among world leaders in Paris this weekend. Few have done less than Mr. Putin to make the world safe for democracy.\n\n\u201cWe only know war lasts.\u201d\n\nOf course we should honor the sacrifice of a generation who did all they were asked, and then some, to build a better world. That honor will be solemnly bestowed in Paris on the centenary of the armistice.\n\nAs French jets streak over a military parade, perhaps the quiet voice of Wilfred Owen will be heard. He was killed in the final week of the war \u2014 his parents received the news as the church bells were ringing, in celebration of armistice. Owen\u2019s precision with words suggests his revulsion at the undisciplined ways leaders spoke, then as now, dividing people. A century later, it is unlikely that we can escape the theater of grandiosity, with leaders crowding the stage for their photo op. But as the world prepares for Armistice Day, a sense of self-restraint would be the most fitting way to remember the tragedy that ended in 1918.\n\nTed Widmer is a distinguished lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York and a fellow of the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "Other responses seem strange in darker ways. One of the strangest is the idea, recently endorsed by Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, that putting guns in schools will reduce school shootings. After the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, President Trump seconded the motion: \u201cIf they had some kind of protection inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation.\u201d\n\nI think of the crowded school library in which my son died. I try to imagine a librarian drawing her Glock and returning fire.\n\nThis scenario resonates for me. A few years ago, tired of being told by gun rights people that I knew nothing about firearms, I bought a handgun and learned to carry and use it. I found the transgressive nature of the exercise stimulating. Survivors of gun violence are not supposed to walk around with guns. I also discovered, to my surprise, that shooting was therapeutic. I was mastering the instrument of my suffering. Now I reckon I\u2019m at just the level of casual knowledge that a gun-owning janitor or history teacher might be expected to have attained. What if I\u2019d been in that library in 1992, charged with keeping my son safe?\n\nI put the question to a man I know, a retired Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who specializes in training people to use guns defensively \u2014 the kind of training that this administration might want to give teachers, the kind that the National Rifle Association imagines could stop the killer in a mass shooting.\n\nThis man spoke with me about the low proficiency of the average gun owner: \u201cImagine shooting hoops in your driveway and thinking you can play in the N.B.A.\u201d He spoke of the hundreds of hours necessary to achieve the Zen-like level of expertise in which, in the midst of chaos, responses are instantaneous and instinctive. He spoke of the continual training necessary to maintain those skills, and he generously agreed to take me through an abbreviated version of that curriculum, training intended to turn an average shooter into, well, what exactly? I wasn\u2019t sure.", "The strongest argument for privileging economics is a simple one: Trump won millions of working-class white voters in the Midwest, the constituency and the region hit hardest by globalization, who had previously voted for Barack Obama. If you voted twice for the first black president, this argument goes, your main political motivation probably isn\u2019t racism, and the fact that Trump ran as an economic populist seems like a more important explanatory fact.\n\nThe rebuttal, the case for privileging race, relies on a raft of studies, the most recent one summarized by Vox\u2019s Zack Beauchamp just weeks before the midterms, which show that those Trump-Obama switchers were more likely to express racially conservative attitudes and hard-line anti-immigration views than they were to have suffered recent economic setbacks.\n\nThe hypothesis floated by these studies' interpreters is that the combination of Obama's presidency and Trump's deliberate race-baiting had an activating effect on white anxiety. Racial backlash against the first black president was more limited in 2012 because Romney didn't play to racial fears, but the backlash escalated, and flipped more white voters, once the next Republican nominee did.\n\nI\u2019ve taken swipes at these studies, but I\u2019m more frustrated by the way they\u2019re used by pundits than by the work itself, which does tell us two important facts \u2014 that Trump probably won getting-by-O.K., working-class Americans rather than the truly desperate, and that Obama-to-Trump switchers had to have a certain indifference to minority concerns (which is what many social-science measures of \u201cracial conservatism\u201d pick up) to tolerate his more bigoted appeals.\n\nAt the same time these kind of studies often treat immigration as a strictly-racial issue when it\u2019s understood by many voters as an economic one (which is why African-American and native-born Hispanics can be immigration hard-liners). They elide the fact that you can base your vote on economic issues without being maximally economically anxious. (Given the G.O.P.\u2019s historic brand as the party of business, you might expect a successful Republican economic-populist pitch to pick off the less anxious working class voters first.) And they encourage a slippage in liberal analysis where a voting bloc\u2019s susceptibility to identity politics get described starkly as a \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d that implicitly places those voters beyond the reach of reason \u2014 even when they voted for Barack Hussein Obama four short years before.", "In June, Congress passed the VA Mission Act, which expands veterans\u2019 access to private care and establishes a commission to determine whether to close V.A. facilities. Its members will be appointed by the president, and they could include medical industry representatives who would benefit from privatization. Congress will be unable to vote on the commission\u2019s decisions. The head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Robert Wilkie, perhaps influenced by a shadowy group of Trump associates nicknamed the Mar-a-Lago Crowd, is said to be developing rules that would significantly increase the number of veterans who get care outside the V.H.A.\n\nAt the same time, private-sector care is more expensive, and the president and congressional Republicans refuse to allocate the money to pay for it, so each dollar that goes to it will come out of the V.H.A. budget. This will starve the system of needed resources, leave thousands of doctor and nurse vacancies unfilled, and force hospitals and clinics to shut down.\n\nThe Koch brothers may be delighted by the prospect of a crippled system. Patients of the V.A.\u2019s 11,000 physicians and other caregivers have a different view. The V.H.A. isn\u2019t perfect ; there have been some bad actors, and veterans often complain about having to wait for appointments. But while veterans\u2019 organizations want better funding and staffing of the V.H.A., they overwhelming support its mission, for reasons outlined in \u201cVA Healthcare: A System Worth Saving,\u201d a report that I co-wrote for the American Legion last year.\n\nDismantling the V.H.A. would jeopardize the health of its largely poor and working-class patients. It would also undermine the medical research and teaching that benefits all Americans.\n\nV.H.A. researchers have already given us the nicotine patch, the shingles vaccine, and innovative approaches to geriatric and end-of-life care. The administration is conducting a Million Veteran Program to determine how genes affect veterans\u2019 health and ours. Because it treats so many patients with prostate cancer, it received a $50 million grant from the Prostate Cancer Foundation to discover new treatments for that disease.", "One muggy Saturday last summer, I went on a date with a man who seemed entirely fine. We drank two beers and went for a walk, and he explained why he liked certain buildings that we passed. We kissed, and his breath tasted like cigarettes. We parted ways, and I couldn\u2019t muster the energy to answer his emoji-laden follow-up texts about my weekend activities.\n\nThe date was mediocre at best \u2014 but in the days that followed, I second-guessed my decision not to see him again. Maybe I had written him off too soon; maybe I should have given things a chance to develop. After all, he had some good qualities. He was handsome, tall, employed \u2014 and not, refreshingly, as a writer.\n\nIt was only after a painfully on-the-nose dream a few weeks later that I stopped doubting my intuition. In the dream, I had agreed to a second date, and I had brought along two friends to observe our interactions and help me assess him. At the end of the group outing, my friends pulled me away and offered a unanimous decision: He wasn\u2019t for me. I had made the right call.\n\nBy the time we reach adulthood, most of us have accepted the conventional wisdom: We shouldn\u2019t dwell on our dreams. Even though research suggests that REM sleep \u2014 when most dreaming takes place \u2014 is crucial for mental and physical health, we think of dreams as silly little stories, the dandruff of the brain. We\u2019re taught that talking about our dreams is juvenile, self-indulgent, and that we should shake off their traces and get on with our day.", "By the end of the night, it was clear that Democrats won the House, but not by how much.\n\nIn the following days, however, new races kept being called. McBath\u2019s victory was especially sweet. She\u2019d become an activist after the 2012 murder of her son, Jordan Davis, by a white man who, angry over loud music, shot up a car Davis was riding in. Running in her son\u2019s memory, she beat an incumbent with a top rating from the National Rifle Association in a largely white district.\n\nAs I write this, Democrats have flipped at least 30 House seats, and their total haul could go as high as 40. Democrats virtually wiped out the Republican Party in the Northeast, but they also won new seats in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and South Carolina. The party is on track to make more gains in the House than it has in any election since Watergate's aftermath. Across the country, Democrats flipped at least 333 statehouse seats, a third of all those lost over the course of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe seeds of this success were planted after Trump\u2019s election, when all over America scared, angry people searched for mechanisms that could constrain him. The democratic institutions that should have thwarted an authoritarian demagogue like Trump had failed, said Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, which would quickly become one of the most important Resistance groups. People were \u201clooking around to see who or what was going to come and save them,\u201d Levin said. \u201cAnd the answer was nothing. The answer was that they had to do it themselves.\u201d\n\nSo newly mobilized activists got to work, and quickly realized that Trump was as much a symptom of American democratic rot as its cause. In many places Democrats had neglected local organizing, allowing the party to wither at the state and local level. Throughout Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, Republicans had built up tremendous power in the state legislatures , which they\u2019d used to making voting harder. In the 2010 redistricting \u2014 the once-in-a-decade process of redrawing electoral maps \u2014 a significant degree of Republican gerrymandering gave the party an enduring advantage in the House of Representatives.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s hard to remember now, but last year, many people thought it highly unlikely that Democrats could win the House, since Republicans had engineered a significant structural advantage. \u201cUltimately, Trump\u2019s approval rating probably needs to be at or below 35 percent for the House to flip,\u201d said The Cook Political Report.\n\nLevin recalled a meeting last year with allies and supporters in California. He told them that because grass-roots passions had grown so intense, \u201cI think we can take the House.\u201d But the notion felt so wishful, he recalled, \u201cYou had to say it in hushed tones. You couldn\u2019t say it out loud.\u201d\n\nSince then, Resistance energy has kept building on itself. Last year, Erin Zwiener, a children\u2019s book author, three-time \u201cJeopardy\u201d champion, and Indivisible activist in Texas, launched a campaign for state representative in her Republican-controlled district south of Austin. \u201cParticularly at the beginning, it definitely seemed uphill,\u201d she told me this week. But while her district had voted for Trump, the margin had been only about 4.5 percentage points, \u201cand we were seeing folks rise up against the presidency.\u201d", "Women in Congress say they bring their perspective to fill yawning gaps and previous blind spots in legislation. Issues at the forefront of the Democrats\u2019 agenda affect women disproportionately \u2014 more women live in poverty, more receive Medicare or Medicaid because they live longer than men, and many women oversee health care and education in their households.\n\nVeteran congresswomen cite examples of their advocacy. Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said she presses to make sure that clinical trials include women of color, since they have often been left out of medical studies. Professor Swers noted that Senators Gillibrand of New York and Claire McCaskill of Missouri and former Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire were driving forces behind hearings and legislation on sexual assault in the military, even if their specific solutions differed.\n\nOf 83 women interviewed by the political scientist Kelly Dittmar and her co-authors for a recent book on women in Congress, \u201cA Seat at the Table,\u201d many said that they focused on getting things done \u2014 and that building personal ties can help them try to find some aspect of policy they can collaborate on. So even if the overall number of bipartisan bills isn\u2019t different for women than for men, they do feel as though collaboration matters.\n\nRepresentative Grace Meng, Democrat of New York, said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing scientifically proven, but I do feel women legislators have a very different dynamic when they\u2019re working together. I have a network of women members, and when we have ideas we bounce them off each other and no one\u2019s worried about someone stealing credit.\u201d\n\nShe conceded that it has been harder than ever before to find cross-party agreement, but she pointed to two bipartisan initiatives: hearings on sexual assaults in the workplace, and her work with Republicans to offer wider access to feminine hygiene products. And constituent protection will unite congressional delegations: Representative Martha Roby, Republican of Alabama, worked with her Democratic colleague from Alabama, Representative Terri Sewell, to defeat amendments that would have harmed Alabama\u2019s catfish industry, much of it in Representative Sewell\u2019s district.\n\nProfessor Swers noted that women elected from swing districts will have incentives to embrace moderation and strike compromises to keep their seats and to placate voters disillusioned with congressional paralysis. With Democrats in control of the House, more women will be in positions of power in the institution \u2014 Nancy Pelosi of California may well become speaker again, and women will head a few powerful committees like Appropriations and Financial Services.\n\nIn the end, even with the record numbers of women elected, they remain less than one quarter of Congress. \u201cWe\u2019re still a foreign body,\u201d Representative Meng said.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram,", "Fufu is boiled green plantains and cassava, pounded in a wooden mortar to a distinct pum-pum-pum beat. Fufu, the way I like it, comes out a warm yellow, with specks of black from the plantain seeds. But fufu on its own is bland. Fufu is both food and utensil, and strong enough to scoop up soup. Ghanaians eat it with palm soup, groundnut soup, a tomato soup called light soup or ebunuebunu, green soup. Adventurous eaters go for a combination of all four, known as nkatenkontobenkwan. But I am a purist. Ebunuebunu is my favorite.\n\nFufu originated among the Akan, the ethnic group that includes the Ashanti, Akwapim and Fanti people of what is today southern Ghana and Ivory Coast. It journeyed across West Africa as foofoo, foufou or foutou, and sailed across the Atlantic in the hearts of the people who were uprooted and enslaved, even keeping its name in Cuba. Of ebunuebunu, however, I am hard pressed to find derivatives. Its ingredients are the leaf of the cocoyam plant; dried mudfish, tilapia or other river fish; mushrooms; snails; onions; ginger; garlic; and sometimes grasscutter, the cane rat, which my mother says \u201cadds gamy flavor for those who like it.\u201d The ingredients are slow-cooked until they coalesce into a forest-green broth that looks like witches\u2019 brew and tastes like smoke and earth, with a wholesomeness that lingers on the tongue.\n\nFor many Africans, recipes are one of the last vestiges of connection between our presents and pasts, before the culture-changing influences of Islam, Christianity and colonialism. What we thought was African print fabric turns out to be imported from Indonesia via the Netherlands. Our religions, our languages, are now mishmashes of what was and what infiltrated.\n\nEven with food, pure ancestral links can be tenuous. In Ghana, for instance, there are two types of cocoyam. One was native to the forests of the Ashanti, and the other was introduced from the Americas, possibly in the 16th or 17th century, or much later, in the 1800s, by West Indian missionaries. The native type is called old cocoyam and the other, new cocoyam.", "It would be understandable if you assumed that the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 had been repealed. But in fact it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary. Consequently, over the last two decades we have allowed successive waves of mergers that make a mockery of the 1950 law, and have concentrated economic power in ways that are dangerous to the polity.\n\nIn recent years, we have allowed unhealthy consolidations of hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry; accepted an extraordinarily concentrated banking industry, despite its repeated misfeasance; failed to prevent firms like Facebook from buying up their most effective competitors; allowed AT&T to reconsolidate after a well-deserved breakup in the 1980s; and the list goes on. Over the last two decades, more than 75 percent of United States industries have experienced an increase in concentration, while United States public markets have lost almost 50 percent of their publicly traded firms.\n\nThere is a direct link between concentration and the distortion of democratic process. As any undergraduate political science major could tell you, the more concentrated an industry \u2014 the fewer members it has \u2014 the easier it is to cooperate to achieve its political goals. A group like the middle class is hopelessly disorganized and has limited influence in Congress. But concentrated industries, like the pharmaceutical industry, find it easy to organize to take from the public for their own benefit. Consider the law preventing Medicare from negotiating for lower drug prices: That particular lobbying project cost the industry more than $100 million \u2014 but it returns some $15 billion a year in higher payments for its products.\n\nWe need to figure out how the classic antidote to bigness \u2014 the antitrust and other antimonopoly laws \u2014 might be recovered and updated to address the specific challenges of our time. For a start, Congress should pass a new Anti-Merger Act reasserting that it meant what it said in 1950, and create new levels of scrutiny for mega-mergers like the proposed union of T-Mobile and Sprint.\n\nBut we also need judges who better understand the political as well as economic goals of antitrust. We need prosecutors willing to bring big cases with the courage of trustbusters like Theodore Roosevelt, who brought to heel the empires of J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller, and with the economic sophistication of the men and women who challenged AT&T and Microsoft in the 1980s and 1990s. Europe needs to do its part as well, blocking more mergers, especially those like Bayer\u2019s recent acquisition of Monsanto that threaten to put entire global industries in just a few hands.\n\nThe United States seems to constantly forget its own traditions, to forget what this country at its best stands for. We forget that America pioneered a kind of law \u2014 antitrust \u2014 that in the words of Roosevelt would \u201cteach the masters of the biggest corporations in the land that they were not, and would not be permitted to regard themselves as, above the law.\u201d We have forgotten that antitrust law had more than an economic goal, that it was meant fundamentally as a kind of constitutional safeguard, a check against the political dangers of unaccountable private power.\n\nAs the lawyer and consumer advocate Robert Pitofsky warned in 1979, we must not forget the economic origins of totalitarianism, that \u201cmassively concentrated economic power, or state intervention induced by that level of concentration, is incompatible with liberal, constitutional democracy.\u201d\n\nTim Wu (@superwuster) is a law professor at Columbia, a contributing opinion writer and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "We have also paid for extras like trips to museums (about $4 each) and $250 f or a weeklong class trip to Austri a intended to foster independence (a highlight was that each child did a short walk alone at night in a field), but that\u2019s it. On the few occasions when the school organized fund-raising efforts, the recipients were in other countries.\n\nBased on their academic performance in fourth grade, children in Germany are divided into three tracks. I do not agree with this system but high-performing children benefit greatly. The top track qualifies for \u201cgymnasium,\u201d the most advanced secondary school, with a curriculum that prepares students for higher education. The gleaming facilities of our daughter\u2019s gymnasium, complete with sports halls, music rooms and a library housing ancient books, rivals those of any top university. Did I mention that higher education is free?\n\nThe schools I attended growing up in California were nothing like this. I was in middle school when Proposition 13, a law meant to ease residents\u2019 tax burden, passed in 1978. The impact on the state\u2019s school budgets was immediate. I still remember art, music and language programs being gutted seemingly overnight, and counselors and librarians disappearing. As a parent, I assumed that for schools to get what they needed, we would have to pay significantly more in taxes, and who wants that? Parents are expected to donate time and money to make up for what the government can\u2019t provide. In addition to raising funds for our own schools, I and many others raised money for schools in areas with fewer resources. It was the little Dutch boy and the dike, but for every hole we plugged, a dozen more appeared.\n\nAnd in Munich, in addition to well-funded schools, life comes with reliable public transportation. Our morning school commute consists of waving our child out the door as she walks to the nearby tram. It took me years to get used to the sight of tiny children with huge backpacks sitting by themselves on the train.\n\nNow that I have lived in a society with a much better alternative, I realize that the idea of a city where children can practice independence from an early age requires a social contract: A certain number of people have to participate in order to achieve success.

Buildings with more than nine units must apply for the program.\n\nIs the compost program in jeopardy?\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not a raging success. At this moment, the Sanitation Department is not on track to expand the program on time and has cut brown-bin pickup service from twice a week in some areas to once weekly, on recycling days. Service and pickup schedules have been experimental as the Sanitation Department tested behaviors, types of garbage trucks and routes, a Department spokeswoman said.\n\nWhat was the problem with composting?\n\nLow participation in the neighborhoods that took part in the pilot program led to inefficiencies and high costs, Ms. Garcia said. \u201cWe love composting,\u201d said Kristin Brady, of Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, who uses the service every week. \u201cBut most of the people we know don\u2019t compost because of cleaning the honestly somewhat gross outdoor brown bin.\u201d A Department spokeswoman said that residents put only about 10 percent of their food scraps in the brown bins, throwing the rest in the garbage. Thus, garbage trucks with special compost compartments were running around with little to carry.\n\nWhy is participation so low?\n\nMr. Reynoso, who represents parts of Brooklyn, said he thinks the problem is a lack of advertising and education, and the fact that the program is voluntary. His efforts to increase the compost advertising budget have been unsuccessful, he said.\n\n\u201cSurvey 10 people in New York City, and you would be hard-pressed to find a single person who knows how recycling works and how to make it work right, and what it means to the city financially,\u201d Mr. Reynoso said. \u201cIn my building, we received the brown bins, and some fliers. I guarantee I\u2019m the only person in my building who knows how to use them.\u201d\n\nWhat are the major hurdles?\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge is asking New Yorkers to do something different,\u201d Ms. Garcia said.

We will keep marching, legislating, advocating, and pushing Congress until they finally deliver gun safety laws that will keep our communities protected.\u201d\n\nMr. Newsom did not this week offer specific new measures that he would push for, but he did say that he would have signed some gun control bills that Gov. Jerry Brown had vetoed in recent years. Among those were bills that would have expanded restraining orders, to allow co-workers, school employees and mental health providers to ask courts to take away guns from someone.\n\nEven with the country\u2019s toughest gun laws, California has still had the most deaths from mass shootings since 1982, according to a database compiled by Mother Jones \u2014 128 people killed.

Once, that would have thrilled me. Now, it just makes me uneasy.\n\nThe first game I attended at N.U. was a doozy: The Wildcats beat Northern Illinois on Sept. 25, 1982, to break what remains the longest losing streak (34 games) in Division I-A history. My classmates streamed onto the field at Dyche Stadium to dismantle the goal posts in triumph and deposit them in Lake Michigan. The team went on to a losing season, though: It had been a long time since the days when the future Notre Dame legend Ara Parseghian was its relatively successful coach, and even longer since Northwestern had gone to the Rose Bowl.\n\nWe would have been delighted if the team had won more games (it didn\u2019t have a winning season until 1995), but we consoled ourselves by taking a sort of perverse pride in our losses. As the Wildcats were being pounded by Big Ten opponents \u2014 especially our downstate rival, the University of Illinois \u2014 the N.U. students in the stands would chant, \u201cThat\u2019s all right, that\u2019s O.K., you\u2019re going to work for us one day!\u201d Obnoxious and classist, yes, but satisfying.\n\nWhen I worked for the sports section of the campus newspaper, we\u2019d dutifully write features about the hopes and dreams of the football players at the beginning of the season.

Mr. Kobach, rather, is Trumpian \u2014 from disregard for the Constitution to grotesque displays of bravado, as when he joined a suburban summer parade in a Jeep mounted with a realistic replica of a .50-caliber machine gun. But the Kelly campaign rightly linked Mr. Kobach\u2019s government-strangling economic vision to the unpopular Mr. Brownback, whose own voters turned against his 2012 \u201clive experiment\u201d with deep tax cuts once they saw what it wrought on public schools and roads.\n\nMr. Kobach ran ads that turned \u201cliberal\u201d into a pejorative and pledged to shield Kansas from outside forces like the federal government and immigrants. Ms. Kelly said she\u2019d put political labels aside and work to build a better Kansas from the inside out.\n\nAt her election-night watch party, before Ms. Kelly\u2019s race was called, the crowd cheered when a fellow pragmatist and the first-time candidate Sharice Davids defeated a four-term Republican in Kansas\u2019s Third Congressional District. But a more staunch progressive did not fare as well. In the Fourth Congressional District, the civil rights attorney and military veteran James Thompson spent 20 months unapologetically championing Medicare for All and marijuana legalization. He won over leftist populists and fed-up conservatives alike but came up short in his effort to flip one of the nation\u2019s most conservative districts, home to the billionaire Charles Koch and Koch Industries.\n\nKansas\u2019s big Democratic wins, it turned out, were by women with less bold platforms who emphasized working across the aisle. It seems that if Midwestern states are bound for a return to their democratic-socialist roots \u2014 prairie populism, it was once called \u2014 they will first require a return to center in female form.\n\nRegional wins by moderate Democrats prompted one writer to suggest that the next Democratic presidential nominee be \u201ca steaming pot of Midwestern Nice.\u201d Midwestern Nice, this Midwestern woman must note, is not necessarily lacking in radical ideas or competitive fire but is never mean or flustered. It is kind yet often plainly unimpressed. Think of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in September when the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh disrespected the authority of Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Her pained smile conveyed that she was having precisely none of it, but she avoided being reactive. Later, Judge Kavanaugh offered an apology, and Senator Klobuchar \u2014 who won re-election this week by a landslide \u2014 accepted.\n\nLaura Kelly, whose campaign emphasized public schools, Medicaid expansion and infrastructure, does her job with the same steadiness. So did Kansas\u2019 last Democratic governor, Kathleen Sebelius, the former Department of Health secretary and an Affordable Care Act architect. Kansas elected Ms. Sebelius twice, not so long ago, along with a lieutenant governor she poached from the Republican Party for the sake of getting things done.", "Q: We recently purchased a co-op in an Upper West Side brownstone with a large living room window overlooking our building\u2019s garden. Now the owners of the abutting apartment in the neighboring brownstone are building a glass balcony off their master bedroom that will obstruct our view and dim our light. Worse, anyone standing on the balcony could peer directly into our living room. The owner claims to have the proper permits. Is there anything we can legally do to stop or alter these plans?\n\nA: Homeowners can\u2019t just build any size balcony off the side of a building. They must follow the city\u2019s building and zoning codes, which set guidelines for the size and location of balconies in residential areas, as well as rights to light and air. If the balcony in question complies with city rules, you\u2019ll have to live with it. But you won\u2019t know unless you check.\n\nHire an architect to determine if the structure violates your access to light and air. The architect could also pull the permits, applications and possibly the design plans from the Department of Buildings to check for other violations.\n\nIf the architect finds that the balcony\u2019s design encroaches on your building\u2019s property, poses a safety hazard or affects the habitability of your apartment by diminishing your access to light and air, your co-op board should address the issue on your behalf, according to Scott S.

It was not enough: When she fell ill this fall, a trip to the doctor in Kandahar City confirmed that she was among the latest Afghan toddlers to contract polio.\n\nAlmost a million children in Kandahar Province alone, like Madina, need at least one dose of oral vaccine a month to head off the disease, health workers say. But many of them also live in the most violent and socially disrupted parts of southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban control large areas and do not want government health workers going door to door.\n\nThese realities make a sustained vaccination campaign brutally difficult for health workers here.

But in the United States, that mostly happens in the workplace.

If I say, \u2018I\u2019m in my 40s and I only want to meet people in my 40s,\u2019 it\u2019s as much of a predictor of friendship as saying I can only be friends with people born in September or who like Madonna or who have my name.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ms. Nelson, only three things are necessary for a relationship to flourish: positivity (it has to feel good); consistency (you have to be in touch on a regular basis); and vulnerability (you have to feel safe with each other). None of them has to do with age.\n\n\u201cA friendship is any relationship where two people both people feel seen in a safe and satisfying way,\u201d she said.\n\nTen years ago, Ms. Nelson created GirlFriend Circles, a kind of match.com for women to meet online and take it offline if they choose.

With two sons now in their early 20s, one of whom has special needs, Ms. Wilkinson said she always felt isolated at home, and unable to meet new people.", "In 1946, Ann Petry had it all, well before we were wondering if this was even possible for a woman. Born in 1908 (or 1911 \u2014 biographers do not agree), Petry was trained as a pharmacist, worked as a reporter, married, and would soon be a mother. Hers was not an overnight success. She paid her dues, publishing short stories and essays, sometimes writing under a male pseudonym. Her star began to rise when she was awarded a $2,500 fellowship from Houghton Mifflin to write her first novel, \u201cThe Street,\u201d which sold a staggering 1.5 million copies. And did I mention that she was a black woman?\n\nSo why do so few people read her work today? I really don\u2019t know.\n\nWhen I first encountered Petry, I was a student at Spelman College, a historically black women\u2019s college in my hometown of Atlanta. My copy of the book sported a classroom-ready cover of muted grays and the title was announced in a blockish, sober font. One of my classmates brought a vintage edition she had found at her parents\u2019 home. This cover spotlighted a woman with long hair, hourglass figure and dramatic makeup. The copy promised a tale of violence and vice. My book indicated that the story in my hands was \u201ca powerful, uncompromising work of social criticism\u201d or something snoozy like that. Could this possibly be the same book?\n\nAbsolutely. \u201cThe Street\u201d is my favorite type of novel, literary with an astonishing plot. The heroine, Lutie Johnson, is a single mother who lives with her 8-year-old son in Harlem. Although her marriage fell apart due to financial hardship caused by racism (and also old-fashioned incompatibility), Lutie still believes in the American Dream. Despite her attempts to be a respectable woman, Lutie\u2019s life intersects with the seedier side of Harlem. The building super becomes obsessed with her and puts her dear little boy in harm\u2019s way. Her neighbor, a Madam with a heart of gold-plate, saves Lutie from rape, but tries to push her into a relationship with a white man with underworld ties. Add to this bubbling plot an abused wife who seeks the services of a local hoodoo practitioner, a crooked lawyer, a smoky nightclub and murder-by-candlestick and you\u2019ve got the kind of novel that makes 400 pages seem like too few.\n\nEven with the twisty breathless plot, Petry engages the issues of her day, which sadly are the issues of our day as well. At every turn, Lutie confronts that many-headed hydra of racism, sexism and classism. Because of its uncompromising view of injustice and its collateral effects, \u201cThe Street\u201d has often been called a women\u2019s version of Richard Wright\u2019s \u201cNative Son.\u201d Both novels hinge upon murders motivated by heat-of-the-moment spontaneity and deep-seated resentment born of relentless discrimination. However, it is unfair to Petry to think of her artistry as a pink-collared version of Wright. James Baldwin famously criticized Wright\u2019s hero in \u201cNative Son\u201d by noting that \u201cWright imagined Bigger, but Bigger never could have imagined Wright.\u201d", "Another idea is for the federal government to provide money to states to help pay the largest medical claims. Such assistance, which provides insurance for insurance carriers, has proved effective in reducing premiums in Alaska and Minnesota, and several other states will try it next year.\n\nIn addition, many Democrats say they want to provide more money to help consumers enroll in health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Over the last two years, Mr. Trump has cut the funds for insurance counselors and enrollment assistance by 84 percent, to $10 million.\n\nReining In Drug Prices\n\nMr. Trump said he believed he could work with Democrats in Congress on \u201clowering the cost of prescription drugs,\u201d and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said the issue was sure to be on the agenda.\n\nDemocrats have praised two of the proposals Mr. Trump has advanced in recent weeks. One would require drug manufacturers to include the list prices of drugs in television advertising. The other would reduce Medicare payments for certain high-cost drugs by using the average of prices in other advanced industrial countries as a benchmark in deciding what Medicare should pay.\n\nDrug companies oppose both ideas. They say the price disclosures would confuse consumers, who often pay less than the full list price. And drug lobbyists say Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for an \u201cinternational price index\u201d would just import price controls from other countries.\n\nLawmakers from both parties could also find common ground with the administration on a bill that requires manufacturers of brand-name drugs to make samples available to generic drug companies trying to develop inexpensive copies of those medicines.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, says some drug makers have tried to stifle competition by blocking access to samples.", "\u201cThe major threat of Europe at the moment is not Orban or Salvini, the major threat is that the E.U.\u2019s institutional arrangement is unstable,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. Mr. Macron\u2019s ambition has been to fix that; but there is no consensus backing him.\n\nWhatever the future of Europe\u2019s institutions, one big difference from 100 years ago is that the Continent is no longer at the heart geopolitics.\n\n\"A century ago, Europe was the center of the world \u2014 even if it was the dark tragic center of the world,\u201d said Dominique Mo\u00efsi, a French author and thinker. \u201cToday we might be back to tragedy but not to centrality.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory is moving elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nThat, too, should be a motivation to shore up European integration, says the Reverend Musser in Alsace.

There is a certain inevitability to its arrival in Williamsburg, on a site formerly occupied by the Rosenwach Tank Co., which made the wooden water towers that are a familiar sight on the New York skyline.

To be clear: The investigation into the crash is still ongoing, and investigators have not made any announcements saying there are problems with the entire fleet of Maxes. But until the investigation is fully concluded, some passengers may still be nervous. Here\u2019s some basic information about the Max and tips on how to find out if you\u2019re scheduled to travel on one on your next trip.\n\nWhat is the Boeing 737 Max?\n\nIt\u2019s the latest generation of the Boeing 737, a kind of aircraft that\u2019s been flying since the 1960s. There are four kinds of Maxes in the fleet, numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10. The 8 series, which was involved in the crash in Indonesia, has been flying the longest; the first one entered service in May of 2017. Max 9s are also now flying passengers, but the 7s and 10s are still in development phases.\n\nThe 737 Max is mostly used for short- and medium-distance flights, but a few airlines also fly it between Northern Europe and the East Coast of the United States.

He also came under fire for serving on the advisory board of World Patent Marketing in Miami, the company that has been accused by the government of bilking millions of dollars from customers.\n\nMr. Whitaker\u2019s time as executive director of the conservative Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, which accused many Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, of legal and ethical violations also came under scrutiny. So did his legal views, including his stated belief that Marbury v.

He accepted a scholarship and played tight end for the Iowa Hawkeyes, with whom he appeared in the 1991 Rose Bowl. Mr. Whitaker scored a couple of touchdowns during his football career, including a clever one on a field goal fake.\n\nMr. Whitaker did not break any records playing for the Hawkeyes, but in Iowa, college football is king. Playing for the Hawkeyes could open doors.\n\n\u201cBy Big Ten standards, he was not an exceptional athlete,\u201d said Don Patterson, an assistant coach during Mr. Whitaker\u2019s time on the football team. \u201cThe things we liked about him were all those intangibles that have so much to do with winning.

He graduated from law school in 1995, and as a lawyer, he became involved in Republican politics.", "Of all the ways in which Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has made America worse, nothing epitomizes it quite so fully as the elevation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States. Intellectually honest conservatives \u2014 the six or seven who remain, at any rate \u2014 need to say this, loudly. His appointment represents an unprecedented assault on the integrity and reputation of the Justice Department, the advice and consent function of the Senate, and the rule of law in the United States.\n\nHow so? A first-pass list:\n\nUnqualified. Until this week, perhaps the least qualified attorney general in living memory was Alberto Gonzales, who served unhappily in George W. Bush\u2019s second term before he resigned under a legal cloud. Yet Gonzales could still be credited for service in the Air Force, a Harvard law degree, four years of service as White House counsel, and a two-year stint as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nThat makes Gonzales the intellectual equivalent of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. next to Whitaker, whose legal credentials include a little more than a year at the Justice Department as Jeff Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, a couple of unsuccessful political runs in Iowa, a stint as a U.S. attorney, and work at regional law firms. Never in the history of the Justice Department has so much rested on the shoulders of someone who can boast of so little.\n\nShady. Kudos to Brittany Shammas of the Miami New Times for breaking the story that Whitaker served as a paid board member of World Patent Marketing, which was shut down in May by a federal court in Florida and ordered to pay a $25 million settlement following a complaint by the Federal Trade Commission that it was a business scam.

He banned a CNN correspondent from the White House, while threatening he would do the same to other journalists. And he accused election officials in Florida and Arizona of rigging the vote against candidates he had campaigned for.\n\nIt was a remarkable assault on the nation\u2019s institutions, even by a president who has gleefully taken a hammer to the press, to judges and prosecutors he does not like, and to an electoral process he has denounced as fraudulent since the day he took office.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s actions suggested a president lashing out after a midterm election loss that he had initially cast as a victory. Now he is girding for battle with a newly empowered Democratic opposition \u2014 one armed with subpoena power and a long list of questions about his conduct in office and ties to Russia \u2014 and it has brought out a fresh aggressiveness in him.\n\nWhile each of his actions rattled Washington, Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment of Matthew G.

We almost never have these crises in New York because we have very few actual competitions. Believe me, if Kirsten Gillibrand had not gotten two-thirds of the vote in our Senate race, you would have a lot more complaining about the way damp ballots in New York City jammed the election machines.\n\nBut about third parties. There are ways to deal with them without totally discounting a lot of votes. Maine has come up with a system where everybody can rank their preferences on the ballot. If nobody gets over 50 percent of the first choices, the last candidate gets tossed out and her supporters\u2019 next preferences come into play.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t anybody think of this before? \u201cWell, it\u2019s been used in Australia for 100 years,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\nIf we talk about this long enough we will have to go back to the 2000 election where Ralph Nader\u2019s third-party run gave Florida to George W. Bush. I have talked with Nader about this a number of times, and he still feels O.K. about it. He refrained from running in 2016, but he didn\u2019t vote for either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton.", "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook said on Friday that it would no longer force employees to settle sexual harassment claims in private arbitration, making it the latest technology company to do away with a practice that critics say has stacked the deck against victims of harassment.\n\nFacebook acted one day after Google announced similar plans. Last week, 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout from the company\u2019s offices around the world to demand that it change the way it handled sexual harassment incidents. Microsoft changed its arbitration policy about a year ago, as did the ride-hailing company Uber six months ago.\n\nThe technology industry, known for its groundbreaking products as well as its trendsetting office culture, has gone to considerable lengths in recent years to keep work-force disputes out of the court system. Forcing employee complaints into arbitration has become as common as free lunches and shuttle buses to the office.\n\nIn arbitration, employment experts say, the playing field shifts toward businesses. Cases are decided by arbitrators instead of judges, and the more cases that companies take to arbitration, the better they fare, according to a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.", "The photo was unforgettable: 19 black women, all dressed in black, gathered in a mock courtroom in Thurgood Marshall School of Law. All of them were running for judgeships in November.\n\nOn Tuesday, 17 of them won their races by double-digits in Harris County, Tex., the nation\u2019s third largest county, which includes Houston.

Backers of the proposal hoped it would serve as a template for similar action elsewhere and perhaps for the country as a whole. But the theoretical elegance of a carbon tax, which most economists and scientists believe is the surest way to control emissions on a broad scale, was no match even in reliably Democratic Washington for relentless fearmongering about job losses, higher electricity bills and more expensive gasoline.\n\nThe defeat in Washington was the most disappointing setback for climate activists in the midterm elections on Tuesday, a day of decidedly mixed messages on climate change in particular and environmental issues more broadly.\n\nOn the negative side of the ledger, the firewall in the Republican-majority Senate against any action at all on climate was fortified by assured Republican pickups in North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri. One new senator, Representative Kevin Cramer, who defeated Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, served as an energy adviser in the 2016 Trump campaign and was an architect of the president\u2019s energy agenda, which consists mainly of drilling oil and gas wells on just about every square inch of available federal land, onshore and off. If Rick Scott, the Republican Florida governor, maintains his narrow lead over Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, it will be another major loss for the environment. Governor Scott\u2019s administration for a time barred the use of the term \u201cclimate change\u201d in official documents, and the governor was so inattentive to Florida\u2019s many climate-related risks, including sea level rise and flooding, that he was sued by a group of young people for ignoring the issue.", "In a landmark move bound to further shake the tobacco industry, the Food and Drug Administration plans to propose a ban on menthol cigarettes next week as part of its aggressive campaign against flavored e-cigarettes and some tobacco products, agency officials said.\n\nThe proposal would have to go through the F.D.A. regulatory maze, and it could be several years before such a restriction took effect, especially if the major tobacco companies contest the agency\u2019s authority to do so. None of the major tobacco companies would comment on the possibility of barring menthol cigarettes at this early stage.\n\nBut such a move has been long-awaited by public health advocates, who have been especially concerned about the high percentage of African-Americans who become addicted to menthol cigarettes.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, the agency\u2019s commissioner, would not comment publicly on the proposal on Friday. But in a recent interview, he said the F.D.A. was revisiting the issue, one that had been weighed in previous administrations. \u201cIt was a mistake for the agency to back away on menthol,\u201d he said earlier this fall.", "The first overall pick in the 2001 draft out of Cretin-Derham Hall High School, the same program that produced the Hall of Famer Paul Molitor, Mauer made his debut at the Metrodome on April 5, 2004, two weeks before his 21st birthday. He signed his megadeal three weeks before the Twins began playing at Target Field.\n\nMauer acknowledged down the stretch this season that he wasn\u2019t sure yet whether he was interested in continuing to play, with twin 5-year-old daughters at home and a third child on the way for him and his wife, Maddie. Then came the final game of the season on Sept. 30, when he doubled in his last at-bat and donned his catcher\u2019s gear to symbolically take one more pitch in the top of the ninth inning as he tearfully waved to the adoring crowd. Not many players could experience a farewell more poignant than that.\n\nWhat made the moment so emotional was the fact that Mauer hadn\u2019t been behind the plate since Aug. 19, 2013, when a foul tip banged off his mask and triggered a concussion that forced him to move to first base.\n\n\u201cThe concussion I experienced that season not only changed my life professionally with a move to first base, but changed me personally as well,\u201d Mauer wrote.\n\nWhile his athleticism \u2014 he had a scholarship waiting for him to play quarterback at Florida State and was a sharpshooting guard on the basketball team in high school \u2014 allowed for a relatively smooth transition on defense, the effects of the head injury robbed him of his prowess at the plate for most of the next three years.", "Over all, the data shows that Border Patrol agents apprehended 50,975 people last month, the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year. Customs and Border Protection quietly released the new data on its website on Friday evening without comment.\n\nThe new data also follows Mr. Trump\u2019s ordered deployment of 5,600 active-duty military troops to the southwest border. They are there to help stop what had been estimated as 6,000 migrants heading to the United States after fleeing the grinding poverty and violence of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nMany of the migrants, currently traveling through Mexico, have said they intend to seek asylum in the United States. The number of people in the caravan has declined in recent days, and it is unclear how many will reach the border. The group is still weeks away.\n\nThe increase in migrants is certain to put more pressure on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary whose job security is seen as increasingly vulnerable. Mr. Trump has repeatedly complained that Ms. Nielsen has failed to stem the flow of illegal migration that rose after the administration\u2019s first year.\n\nIt was unknown if Mr. Trump, who was traveling to Paris, had been briefed on the new apprehension numbers. The president has made clear that he is frustrated by the rising border numbers.", "ATLANTA \u2014 The allies of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate trailing in the Georgia governor\u2019s race, hit the streets and the phones on Friday in a vigorous last-minute push to get anyone who cast a provisional ballot to ensure that their vote would count, in the hopes of forcing the close, bitter and expensive contest into a runoff.\n\nIt was a dramatic and unorthodox political effort, a kind of post-campaign campaign to give Ms. Abrams the chance to go into a Dec. 4 overtime round with Brian Kemp, her Republican adversary.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Kemp declared victory in the race and argued that no math could bring his total to less than 50 percent, which would automatically force a runoff. Mr. Kemp currently has 50.3% of the 3.9 million total votes cast, leading Ms. Abrams by about 63,000 votes.\n\nPresident Trump, who has endorsed Mr. Kemp, declared him the victor on Twitter Friday. \u201cIt is time to move on!\u201d he said.", "The Great War was ending so New York City went wild, from its harbors to churches and streets and skyscrapers. The electric charge of that moment can still be felt a century later in a letter from Captain John F. Sweeney of the 15th Precinct in Manhattan, who described the scene to one of his men serving overseas.\n\nA police officer at 14th Street and Third Avenue called the station house at 3:30 a.m. to say that he had spotted an extra edition \u2014 that era\u2019s version of a news alert \u2014 announcing the signing of the Armistice that ended World War I.\n\n\u201cAt 4:15 the first steam whistle was going, to be followed by another, first from one section of the city and then another, then the church bells to peal out the wonderful news, heads began to appear from the windows and people would say, hey cop, what is it all about,\u201d Captain Sweeney wrote, breathless in punctuation, \u201cand if I answered one, I answered 150 that the war was over.\u201d", "Last year, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a record 944 individuals and entities, according to a count provided by the law firm Gibson Dunn. This year, the number is expected to far exceed 1,000, according to Adam M. Smith, who was a top sanctions official in the Obama administration. By comparison, President Barack Obama imposed penalties on 695 individuals and entities in 2016, the previous high mark.\n\n\u201cSanctions are the perfect tool for someone like President Trump, who arrived into office with no governing experience and no real relationships in Congress, the bureaucracy or among world leaders,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cSanctions let him govern on his own. He just has to write an executive order, and it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s fondness for sanctions illustrates a core contradiction of his foreign policy. No modern American president has been as dismissive of \u201cglobalism\u201d or as vigorous in the defense of sovereignty as Mr. Trump. \u201cWe reject the ideology of globalism,\u201d he said at the United Nations on Sept. 25, adding that \u201cresponsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance, but also from other new forms of coercion and domination.\u201d And yet the power of sanctions springs from the very system of international agreements that Mr. Trump rejects, and it is a device widely seen outside of the United States as an assault on sovereignty and a form of American coercion and domination.\n\nIn some ways, sanctions are the perfect American weapon. They are cheap, put no American lives at risk and elicit no equivalent response. Thanks to the centrality of the dollar to the global financial system, only the United States has the power to fully wield them. Sanctions\u2019 power was demonstrated in April when penalties against the Russian aluminum producer Rusal for its connections to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and against the Chinese telecommunications company ZTE for doing business with Iran and North Korea, crippled the two global giants.\n\nThe big problem, however, is that sanctions rarely work. Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, said that in his study of 100 years of sanctions efforts, 90 percent of the penalties applied for national security purposes ultimately failed. In some cases, they were disastrous: Japan\u2019s 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor was in large part a response to American oil sanctions.\n\nIran proves the point. Tehran\u2019s regional meddling was particularly ambitious from 2012 to 2015 \u2014 just as sanctions were at their most onerous. There is a small chance that sanctions could lead to the overthrow of Iran\u2019s government, but the administration has repeatedly insisted that regime change is not its goal.\n\nBesides being largely unsuccessful, the Trump administration\u2019s unilateral use of sanctions has fueled a campaign led by Europe, Russia and China to remake the financial system, removing the United States from its heart. The consequences for America\u2019s power, economy and alliances could be profound.", "To the female cross-country runners, who had sat silently outside the Nov. 2 meeting, the decision was infuriating but not surprising.\n\n\u201cWe were angry, but we knew it was coming; the football team gets what they want,\u201d one senior member of the women\u2019s cross-country and track teams said. The runner requested anonymity, fearing repercussions for herself and her teams, which share several members and often train together.\n\nThe prioritization of football teams over other sports is not uncommon at N.C.A.A. institutions, and members of the cross-country team at Rowan, where athletes compete in the N.C.A.A.\u2019s Division III, say their university is no exception. The runner who requested anonymity and several other team members said that they did not have locker rooms near the track where they train and that they sometimes had to provide their own transportation to meets.\n\nRowan\u2019s football coach, Jay Accorsi, did not respond to requests for comment, and the athletic department staff referred questions about the practice arrangement to the university\u2019s communications department. An official there disputed the notion that the runners had been forced away from the track, saying the athletic department was merely enforcing a longstanding policy that only one team can use a facility at a time.\n\nAccording to Joe Cardona, the vice president for university relations at Rowan, that means the football team gets the field \u2014 and by extension the track that surrounds it inside Rowan\u2019s stadium \u2014 when it holds practice. Cardona said the cross-country and track teams had declined an offer to use the track at a different time of the day.", "Want climate news in your inbox?

After much planning \u2014 a rented house in Telkwa, Google Earth maps of the river and hours of tying flies \u2014 our group of five loaded two trucks with rafts and supplies and headed the nearly 1,000 miles north from Portland, Ore.\n\nMy one previous trip to the Bulkley, in 2001, had been a disaster. Heavy rain had transformed the river\u2019s generally clear waters into chocolate milk, rendering it almost unfishable. Rivers going out of shape is a constant threat in this wet part of the world. My companion and I hooked two steelhead that week.\n\nThere was little rain in the forecast for 2018\u2019s mid-September week \u2014 prime time for fish returns \u2014 and we were heartened to arrive at the Walcott bridge boat launch on Day 1 to find clear water.\n\nOver the next five days, we floated four different sections of the Bulkley/Morice, rising before dawn and returning to our domicile after dark. We ran our own shuttles, leaving one vehicle at the takeout point so we could return to retrieve the second truck from the put-in. Then we returned to the takeout to retrieve our rafts.\n\nOne starting point on the Morice lacked a formal boat launch, requiring us to carry our rafts down a steep bank to the river \u2014 no small feat for our aging crew. (This was a buddy\u2019s 60th birthday celebration.) Fishing was difficult, thanks to colder than usual water temperatures, but we slowly cracked the code. On the last two days, Marcus and I each hooked nine fish, a season\u2019s worth of fish on our home rivers.\n\nOn the long ride home, we contacted the owner of the Telkwa house about its availability in 2019.

That means voters left their Senate choice blank, or the choice was not counted because of a tabulation error like an equipment problem. This is highly unusual, and there\u2019s nothing like this discrepancy elsewhere in the state. Immediately across the county line in Miami-Dade County, about the same number of people voted in the Senate race and the governor\u2019s race.\n\nThere are two distinct patterns of undervoting in Broward County.\n\nUndervotes in the 24th Congressional District\n\nA particularly large number of undervotes came in the part of Broward County that belongs to the 24th Congressional District, a discrepancy first identified by Matthew Isbell, a Democratic consultant. There, the undervote is about 9 percent. In other parts of that congressional district \u2014 in Miami-Dade County \u2014 there\u2019s no significant undervote.\n\nOne possibility is that there\u2019s some kind of tabulation error, because the scale of the undervote is so significant.

Putnam\u2019s Sons. (2011)\n\nIn this collection of eight loosely connected short stories, Fallon writes about military wives in Fort Hood, Tex. (where she has lived as an Army wife). In one story, \u201cLeave,\u201d a suspicious soldier stealthily returns home and breaks into his basement, where he begins covert surveillance of his wife and daughter. In \u201cInside the Break,\u201d the drama centers on a threat that never occurred to any of the wives when they thought of their husbands leaving: the 15 female soldiers being deployed with them. \u201cMs Fallon\u2019s emphasis is not on the negative,\u201d wrote our reviewer. \u201cIt\u2019s just that life is tough at Fort Hood.\u201d", "\u201cWe are concerned about Wells Fargo,\u201d said Ms. Waters, who is planning to meet with the bank\u2019s executives and could call them to testify at a hearing.\n\nShe said she also plans to look carefully at the efforts of Mick Mulvaney \u2014 the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 to weaken the bureau\u2019s enforcement activities and at Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Deutsche Bank, which has faced legal trouble for laundering money for Russian entities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work on trying to find out more about the relationship with Deutsche Bank, with him and his family and money laundering,\u201d Ms. Waters said, referring to Mr. Trump.\n\nShe insisted that, in exercising oversight authority, she is not engaging in retaliation for being disparaged as \u201clow I.Q.\u201d by the president.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with what he said about me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s meaningless.\u201d\n\nMs. Waters said she hopes to find common ground with Republicans, including on an overhaul of federal flood insurance. But her priorities, for the most part, stand in stark contrast to those of her predecessor, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, who spent the past two years pushing to water down the new rules created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law and to neuter the consumer finance watchdog set up by the Obama administration.\n\nThis year, Mr. Hensarling helped shepherd through a bill that relaxed some of those rules.\n\nThe 2010 law, for example, established stricter regulations for banks with at least $50 billion in assets. The new legislation raised the threshold to $100 billion and instructed the Fed to consider leniencies for even larger banks. Last month, the Fed complied, proposing to divide the biggest banks into four categories. Under the proposal, only a few top-tier behemoths like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America would still be subject to the toughest rules.\n\nUnder Ms. Waters, the committee \u2014 which has oversight of the Fed as well as the banking industry \u2014 is likely to scrutinize the Fed\u2019s plans to soften regulations.", "Juris Jurjevics, a founder of Soho Press, an independent publisher that gambled on unsolicited manuscripts by emerging writers and produced serious novels and exotic crime stories, died on Wednesday in the Bronx.

It can be combined with meringue and turned into marshmallows. Or it can be put to use making a homemade version of Jell-O.

Now Israel is taking a different approach, easing a blockade and allowing millions of dollars in aid to flow into Gaza, the impoverished enclave controlled by Hamas, its bitter foe.\n\nThe aim of the change, in a plan mediated by Egypt and with money supplied by Qatar, is to provide much-needed relief for Gaza, restore calm on the Israeli side of the border and avert another war.\n\nThe clashes along Gaza\u2019s border have caused misery on both sides: At least 170 Palestinians have been killed, and thousands of acres of Israeli farmland have been torched.\n\nBut the change in Israel\u2019s approach presents risks for leaders on both sides, pressures that could doom even this limited warming of relations.", "In the first verse, Brown talks about the preponderance of school shootings in stark terms:\n\nRemember when 9th grade was about getting laid\n\nSkipping class trying not to get caught\n\nNow you gotta take a test in a bulletproof vest\n\nScared to death that you might get shot\n\nThat this sentiment is coming from Brown, someone as fluent with country tradition as with the reasons to challenge it, matters a great deal. He\u2019s a young star not as beholden to the expectations of genre elders, but with a rich, oozy voice that would have been as resonant two or four or six decades ago. The song moves with a hollow, post-Sam Hunt thump, which gives it a contemporary sheen.\n\nWhich makes it a challenge: Will country music\u2019s institutions embrace it, support it, promote it even? Will country radio\u2019s mainstream find room for it? Will even a boundary-pushing D.J. like Bobby Bones play it?

During raucous rallies, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that the Democrats wanted to \u201cinvite caravan after caravan\u201d of asylum seekers into the United States. He added, \u201cA blue wave will equal a crime wave, and a red wave will equal law and safety.\u201d\n\nIt was in Indiana where the president used his finger to draw in the air the middle initial of his predecessor, Barack Hussein Obama, in an apparent nod to \u201cbirtherism,\u201d a conspiracy theory over Mr. Obama\u2019s citizenship that Mr. Trump has fueled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Obama,\u201d Mr. Trump declared with the added emphasis.\n\nMr. Donnelly had been seen as especially vulnerable: The president won the state of Indiana by 19 points in 2016. Mr. Donnelly tried to protect himself by veering to the right on immigration, touting his support for a border wall and for increasing cooperation between the police and immigration authorities. Toward the end of his campaign, he began to call out the \u201cradical left,\u201d hoping to distance himself from the most liberal members of his party.\n\nHis attempts were not enough to satisfy voters. He lost to Mr. Braun on Tuesday by a sizable margin.\n\nBut there was a clear danger on Tuesday for Republicans running in moderate battlegrounds who relied too heavily on Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nIn Virginia, Representative Dave Brat aligned himself with Mr. Trump on the border wall and travel ban, and on Tuesday he was narrowly defeated largely because of a backlash from suburban voters. In Pennsylvania, Scott Wagner ended his Republican bid for governor with a campaign ad warning voters that \u201ca dangerous caravan of illegals careens to the border\u201d and that the Democratic incumbent, Tom Wolf, was doing nothing to stop it. Mr. Wagner lost by nearly 17 points.", "In the search for answers after a shooting that left 12 people dead at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., much attention has been focused on the gunman\u2019s time in the Marine Corps, wondering if post-traumatic stress disorder from combat in Afghanistan left him primed to kill.\n\nDominique Colell says that\u2019s a mistake.\n\nShe was a track coach at Newbury Park High School when Ian D. Long, whom authorities identified as the gunman, was a senior on the team. Even then, years before he deployed to Afghanistan, she said, Mr. Long was defiant and angry and eventually assaulted her on the track.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be blamed on PTSD.

But he has made sure to criticize Ms. DeVos\u2019s vocal brand of school choice advocacy.\n\nTuesday\u2019s results were compounded by other recent blows for charters in liberal states.\n\nIn 2016, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum that would have expanded the state\u2019s high-performing charter schools. Though backers poured $20 million into the race, it was no match for Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders, progressive stars who opposed the initiative.\n\nPhilanthropists tried again in California over the summer, when they spent $23 million to bolster the former Los Angeles mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the primary for governor. Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat, was easily beat by Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, who has been vague about the role of charters as he seeks to make California an epicenter of opposition to the Trump administration.\n\nSome advocates find a sliver of hope in the fact that even the most liberal Democrats acknowledge that charter schools are here to stay. Many opponents want to slow growth, not destroy charters.\n\n\u201cNo matter how hostile some of the cities get to charters, the charters have endured,\u201d said Jeanne Allen, the chief executive of the Center for Education Reform, a national school choice advocacy group.\n\nIn New York, the insurgent Democratic candidates\u2019 criticism of charters was somewhat less central to their campaigns than their support for traditional public schools. And though most of those Democrats said they would reject any plan to expand charter schools, they are aware that charters are popular among some families in their own districts.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to alienate anybody,\u201d said Alessandra Biaggi, who in the Democratic primary unseated one of the charter lobby\u2019s most reliable allies, State Senator Jeffrey D.

In the second of Smith\u2019s group of seasonal novels, four people \u2014 two long-estranged sisters, one of their sons and his girlfriend \u2014 converge at a sprawling house at Christmastime. Wordplay, grim humor and the uncanny (including a disembodied head that never speaks) are all thrown into the mix, and Smith has an enormously expansive vision, processing news items and our broader cultural moment.\n\nTEN RESTAURANTS THAT CHANGED AMERICA, by Paul Freedman. (Liveright, $23.95.) The restaurants Freedman features aren\u2019t necessarily the finest, but they represent a range of pivots in the nation\u2019s history. Howard Johnson\u2019s, for example, appealed to families and pioneered franchising as a shrewd business plan. Chez Panisse\u2019s focus on local ingredients continues to shape American taste.\n\nFRESH COMPLAINT: STORIES, by Jeffrey Eugenides. (Picador, $17.) The stories in Eugenides\u2019s debut collection come in all shades of realism, with particular attention to one of his hallmark themes: failure, whether creative, marital or financial. Our reviewer, Lauren Groff, praised the book, writing, \u201cNearly every one of the stories in this collection is teachable, a model of its own kind of Swiss-clock craftsmanship.\u201d\n\nALI: A LIFE, by Jonathan Eig. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $16.99.) The first full biography of the boxer since his death in 2016, Eig\u2019s book offers an unsparing look at Ali\u2019s politics, retirement and final years, including a Parkinson\u2019s diagnosis. The themes of Ali\u2019s life are timely and resonate today, and Eig\u2019s fluent narrative reads like a novel; he doesn\u2019t shy away from the darker sides of boxing that many other accounts ignore. Our reviewer, Joyce Carol Oates, called the book \u201can epic of a biography.\u201d", "Katie Roiphe reviews the second volume of Sylvia Plath\u2019s letters in this week\u2019s issue. Plath, who committed suicide soon after publishing \u201cThe Bell Jar,\u201d continues to capture the public imagination. Below is Robert Scholes\u2019s 1971 review of that semi-autobiographical novel.\n\nWe are all dying, of course, banker and bum alike, spending our limited allotment of days, hours and minutes at the same rate. But we don\u2019t like to think about it. And those men and women who take the matter into their own hands, and spend all at once with prodigal disdain, seem frighteningly different from you and me. Sylvia Plath is one of those others, and to them our gratitude and our dismay are equally impertinent. When an oracle speaks it is not for us to say thanks but to attend to the message.\n\n\u201cThe Bell Jar\u201d is about the way this country was in the 1950s and about the way it is to lose one\u2019s grip on sanity and recover it again. It is easy to say that insanity is the only sane reaction to the America of the past two decades. And it is also said frequently that the only thing to do about madness is relax and enjoy it. But neither of these \u201cclever\u201d responses to her situation occur to Esther Greenwood, who is the narrator and central character in this novel.\n\nWe follow Esther\u2019s personal life from her summer job in New York, back through her days at New England\u2019s largest school for women, and forward through her attempted suicide, her bad treatment at one asylum and her good treatment at another, to her re-entry into the world like a used tire.", "Rae and Jupiter, for their part, grapple with their mutual attraction, but also their growing realization that Courtney may be the true target of their feelings. The passages narrated by them are where Stone\u2019s writing soars, as each girl struggles to understand her sexual identity and whether it\u2019s as etched in stone as she once thought.\n\nThe novel concludes, satisfyingly, with Jupiter\u2019s perspective, and readers finally get a sense of this flesh-and-blood teenager \u2014 not just a manic pixie girl sex object. In these chapters, declaring yourself \u2014 how you would like to be represented and whom you want to love and connect with \u2014 is treated with real tenderness.\n\nImage\n\nJanelle Milanes\u2019s second Y.A. novel (after \u201cThe Victoria in My Head\u201d), ANALEE, IN REAL LIFE (Simon Pulse, 416 pp., $17.99; ages 12 and up), dives into the contemporary question of how the connections we make in virtual worlds can help or hurt us in the \u201creal\u201d world. Still reeling from her mother\u2019s death from cancer, Analee Echevarria would rather inhabit her favorite online game as Kiri the night elf hunter than deal with her father\u2019s impending nuptials to a lifestyle coach and yogi, or watch her ex-best friend making out with her boyfriend.\n\nAnalee starts to face her anxiety head on when she\u2019s partnered with Seb, a smooth-talking soccer star, on a science project. In a classic romantic comedy fashion that may call to mind Jenny Han\u2019s \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d the two pretend to date for mutual benefits: Seb gets to make his ex-girlfriend jealous and Analee gets to flaunt her fake relationship in front of her former best friend while getting practice for the \u201creal\u201d relationship she hopes to have with Harris, the gaming partner she\u2019s been crushing on but hasn\u2019t yet met in person.\n\nMilanes has created authentic characters with family issues that reflect the world we live in. Analee\u2019s conservative Cuban grandparents have a tough time understanding why their son wants to forgo the traditional wedding and make an alliance with a veggie-eating, vlogging yoga instructor. Seb covers up his difficult home situation with his life-of-the-party attitude. Analee finds it difficult to have face-to-face interactions and even to leave the house after her mother\u2019s death.\n\nThere\u2019s also Analee\u2019s witty internal monologue, which will feel all too familiar to introverts: \u201cI hesitate. I have this thing about sharing food. A spoon soaked with someone else\u2019s saliva? Mixing with the food I\u2019m about to eat? Shudder. If Dad were here, he\u2019d bug his eyes out at me in his silent warning. Oye. No seas extra\u00f1a. Which loosely translates to \u2018Don\u2019t be a weirdo.\u2019\u201d", "The bond that develops between boy and donkey is genuinely heartwarming. And in seeing Louie\u2019s relentless efforts to keep Winslow alive \u2014 he sleeps with him in the cellar, wakes for 4 a.m. feedings and even learns how to administer injections \u2014 young readers may absorb a subtle lesson in passion and persistence. The plot itself is rather uneventful: At one point, Winslow goes missing, and that\u2019s about it, drama-wise. But the story is buoyed by the whisper-weight chapters and Creech\u2019s spare, poetic language. Creech isn\u2019t writing in verse (which she used to great effect in \u201cLove That Dog!\u201d) but her words evoke imagery that will linger in a reader\u2019s mind long after the final page. When Louie first sees Winslow, for instance, \u201che felt a sudden rush, as if the roof had peeled off the house and the sun had dived into every corner of the kitchen.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nSometimes the wild and fierce are more fascinating than the domesticated and cuddly. Carl Hiaasen\u2019s best-selling middle-grade capers (\u201cHoot,\u201d \u201cFlush,\u201d \u201cScat,\u201d \u201cChomp\u201d) all have intrepid tweens, lawbreaking baddies and endangered Florida wildlife at their center. His latest, SQUIRM (Knopf, 276 pp., $18.99; ages 8 to 12), is narrated by Billy Dickens, who lives with his mom and sister in Florida. Billy doesn\u2019t have a \u201chalfway normal life\u201d for a few reasons: He hasn\u2019t heard from his father since he was 3 or 4, his eagle-obsessed mom makes him and his sister move every few years so they can live near an active nest, and he spends most of his free time with snakes.\n\nWhen Billy figures out that his dad \u2014 who may or may not be working for the C.I.A. \u2014 is living in Montana, he flies out West to confront him. There, he meets his father\u2019s new wife and stepdaughter and becomes embroiled in a high-stakes battle involving snakes, grizzlies, drones and villainous gun-toting trophy hunters. It\u2019s a fun romp that will keep readers hooked, even as the plot becomes increasingly convoluted in the manner of a wacky PG-13 movie.\n\nPerhaps best of all is the way Hiaasen conveys the wonders of wild creatures, from the \u201cskittish and solitary\u201d behavior of panthers to the unusual nesting habits of swallows. Don\u2019t be surprised if after reading \u201cSquirm,\u201d your young reader tells you the safest way to handle a yellow rat snake or scare off a grizzly.\n\nAnd now that we\u2019re on the subject of bears, let\u2019s consider the most famous bear of all. Most children think of Winnie-the-Pooh as the mustard-yellow bear in the bafflingly small red shirt. But before Disney got hold of him, dear sweet Pooh was, of course, the creation of the British author A. A. Milne, whose inspiration was an actual black bear named Winnie at the London Zoo during World War I.\n\nImage\n\nAdopted as an orphaned cub by a Canadian Army veterinarian named Henry Colebourn, Winnie eventually sailed to England with the troops. The author Lindsay Mattick and the illustrator Sophie Blackall shared the story in their 2015 Caldecott Medal-winning \u201cFinding Winnie.\u201d Now, Mattick (a great-granddaughter of Colebourn) has teamed with the author Josh Greenhut on WINNIE\u2019S GREAT WAR (Little, Brown, 227 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), a middle-grade novel, also illustrated by Blackall, that expands upon these events for a slightly older audience.\n\nThis fleshed-out Winnie is very much a reflection of Milne\u2019s Pooh \u2014 a na\u00efve, openhearted creature with a great weakness for food and capacity for love. We get a range of dramatic scenes conjured by the authors, including Winnie\u2019s last moments with her mother (who utters \u201cBe brave, my Bear!\u201d before she\u2019s shot by a trapper) and the friendships she makes with squirrels, horses and a rat named Tatters. While the juxtaposition of cute talking animals and excerpts from Colebourn\u2019s actual diary entries is disorienting, the overall result is a work of undeniable charm. This is distinctively old-fashioned, gentle storytelling that children will enjoy hearing read aloud. And the photographs of the real Winnie at the end of the book are the clincher \u2014 a reminder that real animals can be more enchanting than any we\u2019ve imagined.", "Friends, I bring you delights! Glittery, silly, rambunctious delights. Five new humorous children\u2019s books offer young readers a plethora of pleasure, plus pants for potatoes. Though very different from one another, four of the five feature classic children\u2019s book imagery in one form or another. The fifth features, as I said, potato pants.\n\nIn KING ALICE (Feiwel and Friends, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), Matthew Cordell, who won the 2017 Caldecott Medal for \u201cWolf in the Snow,\u201d captures the joy (for kids) and frequent exasperation (for parents) of the dreary, slushy indoor snow day. On a blustery day off from school, young Alice is determined to fill her hours with adventure, enlisting her willing, but bedraggled, dad into the fun. After declaring herself king (\u201cYou mean queen,\u201d suggests her father. \u201cNo! King!\u201d says Alice), Her Highness sets out to cram every ounce of fun from their indoor family time, capturing all of it in a book-within-a-book recounting her adventures. Not even a timeout for the crime of accidental unicorn bopping deters from the fun with Dad. Cordell\u2019s art is lively and especially funny when presented from the king\u2019s crayons. Children may enjoy the fact that even a Caldecott Medal winner is not above a little gastrointestinal humor (this child certainly did). Alice\u2019s mother and baby brother are also along for the ride. Parents will laugh in recognition at the household chaos busy young minds can create during stretches of unexpected indoor time.", "MOGADISHU, Somalia \u2014 Four car bombs exploded outside a hotel in the capital, Mogadishu, on Friday afternoon, killing at least 20 people and injuring 17, the police said.

This time, fire forced the evacuation of the town still reeling from the devastating shooting.\n\nResidents in Thousand Oaks had just begun to mourn the 12 people killed late Wednesday at the Borderline Bar & Grill when the second crisis this week set the city on edge. For hours after the shooting, people crowded into the Thousand Oaks Teen Center, anxious to find out if their loved ones had survived. It was well past lunchtime before it began to empty out. But by midnight, it was crowded again \u2014 this time as a fire evacuation center.\n\nAs wildfires spread through Ventura County, thousands of residents were forced to evacuate, including some who had survived the shooting just 24 hours earlier.\n\nFor Dylan McNey, a 22-year-old carpenter, the evacuation orders were the least of his worries.

But isn\u2019t that one of the best things dogs can give kids, a sense of their own power?\n\nThe delightful comics-style GOOD ROSIE! (Candlewick, 40 pp., $16.99; ages 4 to 8), written by Kate DiCamillo and illustrated by Harry Bliss, stars a little white and brown terrier named Rosie. She has a pleasant daily routine with her owner, George, but she doesn\u2019t have any dog friends, so she\u2019s lonely. (You suspect George, a fussily dressed older gentleman with a balding dome of a head, may be lonely too.) One day, George takes Rosie to the dog park, where a St. Bernard named Maurice tries to befriend her. Rosie feels he\u2019s too big and loud. Then an irritatingly \u201csmall, yippy\u201d dog named Fifi arrives. Again, no. Rosie is lonely even at the dog park. But a mishap occurs: Maurice almost swallows tiny Fifi. After Rosie delivers a strategic bite on the leg, Maurice coughs Fifi back up. She is fine, though her collar now says \u201cFif.\u201d Is friendship possible after all that? You bet! The newly renamed Fif leads the way, asking Rosie directly, \u201cDo you want to be friends with a dog named Fif?\u201d The final page shows a grinning George looking on as the dog friends play \u2014 and he\u2019s flanked by two ladies who must be the owners of Fif and Maurice.\n\nDiCamillo, whose many books include the Newbery Medal-winning \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux,\u201d packs an emotional punch in picture books, chapter books or novels, and Bliss is a wry New Yorker cartoonist and the author-illustrator of the sophisticated picture books \u201cGrace for Gus\u201d and \u201cLuke on the Loose.\u201d Together they\u2019ve created a remarkable guide to making friends: Be honest and direct about what you want, and don\u2019t bite. \u201cGood Rosie!\u201d is divided into eight sections, like mini-chapters, slowing down the pace and making it not just a good read-aloud but a fantastic choice for newly independent readers.\n\nMarla Frazee\u2019s LITTLE BROWN (Beach Lane, 32 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), a parable about a dog with no friends who hoards all the toys at the dog park, is an unusual dog book in that it\u2019s frankly dark, beginning with the muddy colors and foreboding look of its tall pages. Frazee, the creator of \u201cBoss Baby\u201d and many other brilliantly funny and pointed picture books, is not so much offering a lesson as challenging her audience to do better, be more just and kind, figure out how everyone can get a fair share. The dog named Little Brown begins the book \u201ccranky\u201d and alienated, and at the end he\u2019s still cranky and alienated, only he\u2019s sitting atop a pile of treasure.

The exhibition \u201cCalder / Kelly,\u201d which is now open at the L\u00e9vy Gorvy gallery in New York, entertains this question across three floors of work and ephemera by the artists Alexander Calder and Ellsworth Kelly. Spanning five decades, the pieces highlight the aesthetic and personal affinities between these two heavyweights of 20th-century abstract art. American modernists who both spent formative periods in Paris (in the late 1920s and late 1940s, respectively), Calder and Kelly eventually met in that city and maintained a lasting fondness for one another, despite an age difference of 25 years.\n\nThe idea for this exhibition originated three years ago, when the gallerist Dominique L\u00e9vy encountered a Calder mobile and a monochrome Kelly painting within the same line of sight at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation in St. Louis. \u201cI just lost my breath for a moment,\u201d L\u00e9vy recalls of the momentary convergence. \u201cAll my career I\u2019ve done pas de deux dialogue exhibitions because I love them,\u201d she explains, \u201cThey allow you to enter an artist\u2019s world and sometimes what you feel instinctively becomes actually justified.\u201d\n\nAmong the many artworks on display, including Calder\u2019s \u201cRed Maze III\u201d (1954) and Kelly\u2019s \u201cRed White\u201d (1962), are notes that the two artists sent to one another and their families.

Fourteen years ago, at Tama Art University in Tokyo, Baku Takahashi and Tomoko Wada paired up in an introductory glass blowing class; they\u2019re still working together today, driven by a shared belief, as Wada wrote in an email, \u201cthat glass itself, with its transparency and color, is alluring, so we treat it with importance.\u201d Now 32 and married, they\u2019re considered two of the most exciting glass artists in Japan.\n\nAfter graduating and assisting artisans for a few years, Takahashi and Wada rejected Tokyo\u2019s thriving maker scene for Takahashi\u2019s hometown in Fukuoka Prefecture on the country\u2019s southernmost main island, which is home to rocky beaches and citrus-fruit forests whose mandarin-orange hues are reflected in his work. Here, out of a 1,100-square-foot studio, the duo makes sculptures, wall hangings, pendants and small objects that are distinct to each artist but alike in their focus on what Wada calls \u201cspatiality.\u201d For more than a decade, she\u2019s been iterating upon her \u201cApartment\u201d series, for which she fills and stacks glass boxes of various sizes with glinting balls of rainbow-hued glass, dried flowers or lengths of organdy, as if rearranging the rooms of an abstract dollhouse. But the specific contents are not really the point: Within these realms, it\u2019s \u201cthe empty space that is most distinctive,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting, then, that her partner aims to fill the void: Takahashi often produces the fragile flotsam that Wada places inside the cubes. In his own practice, he\u2019s similarly focused on claiming space, sculpting forms he hopes the world hasn\u2019t seen before, even if they are loosely born of a childhood spent reading anime and playing video games. Takahashi melts, cools, fuses and polishes glass shapes in cartoonish shades (royal purple, aquamarine) to create crayon-box-size statues that resemble, say, an Olympic torch from the year 2080 or a religious totem from a dreamed-up pacifist cult.\n\nAs obsessed as Wada and Takahashi are with space, though, their artistic motivation ultimately lies with their chosen material. In Japan, artisans have blown glass for centuries, though many modern techniques were introduced by the Portuguese and the Dutch starting in the 16th century.

The drama ended with an indecipherable but wholly consequential Supreme Court decision that put Mr. Bush in office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that 18 years after 2000, Florida still hasn\u2019t developed competencies in terms of counting ballots in an orderly and timely manner,\u201d said one former top Gore aide who did not want to be named for fear of stirring up old ghosts.\n\nBut Florida wasn\u2019t the only state still furiously counting ballots.\n\nIn the Georgia governor\u2019s race, the state was still trying to determine if the candidates were headed for a runoff. Brian Kemp, the Republican currently ahead of his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, by about 63,000 votes, declared victory this week. But allies of Ms. Abrams spent Friday in a vigorous push to get people who cast provisional ballots because of identification problems to take a final step to ensure their votes would count.\n\nIn Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic candidate in the state\u2019s uncalled Senate race, expanded her lead on Friday to 20,203 votes over Martha McSally, the Republican contender.\n\nAs the complicated political maneuverings unfolded in Florida, there were constant reminders that, 18 years after the Bush-Gore controversies, Florida remains in Republican control \u2014 a crucial factor in an election where partisan interests are at stake. Florida Republicans in 2018 hold the same levers of power over the election that they did in 2000, with the governor appointing the secretary of state in charge of elections.\n\nBy Friday, when the Senate race appeared to be squarely within the margins of an automatic recount \u2014 Mr. Scott was ahead of the Democratic incumbent, Senator Bill Nelson, by only 0.18 percentage points \u2014 the governor\u2019s own lawsuits were heard in state court.

So, as the headline says, what the hell happened to Brazil?\n\nI\u2019m actually not talking about the recent election, in which Brazil\u2019s voters chose someone who appears to be an actual fascist. I\u2019m as horrified as anyone else. However, I have no knowledge whatsoever of Brazilian politics. On the other hand, the backdrop to that election was Brazil\u2019s extraordinary economic crisis of 2015-16: A nation that had been on an upward trajectory, that seemed to have shaken off the legacy of instability, suffered a terrible recession and is experiencing a very slow recovery. And macroeconomics is a subject I\u2019m supposed to know something about.\n\nSo what happened? There has been surprisingly little international discussion of the Brazilian experience, even though it was very severe and Brazil is a pretty big economy (G.D.P. at purchasing power parity about 10 times as large as Greece.) Maybe we\u2019re all too distracted by the political crisis in the West \u2014 Trump, Brexit, etc. Anyway, I\u2019ve been trying to put together a story of the Brazilian crisis, well aware that I may well be missing important aspects.\n\nHere\u2019s what it looks like to me: Brazil appears to have been hit by a perfect storm of bad luck and bad policy, with three main aspects. First, the global environment deteriorated sharply, with plunging prices for the commodity exports still crucial to the Brazilian economy. Second, domestic private spending also plunged, maybe because of an excessive buildup of debt. Third, policy, instead of fighting the slump, exacerbated it, with fiscal austerity and monetary tightening even as the economy was headed down.", "In a perfect French pommes aligot, it\u2019s hard to know where the potatoes end and the cheese begins. A molten, creamy mass of potatoes permeated with mountain cheeses, aligot combines the stretchy pull of fondue with the silky suppleness of potato pur\u00e9e. Soft, gooey and eminently soothing, it\u2019s just the thing to make on an icy, dark day, or at least, when it feels that way deep in your soul.\n\nI first saw aligot potatoes, a dish from the wind-swept Aubrac plateau in France , being whipped up tableside at a restaurant in the Auvergne. Into a well-used copper pot, the waiter beat boiled yellow potatoes and handfuls of grated local tomme fra\u00eeche (sometimes spelled tome fra \u00ee che) until he could pull it above his head. Then he mounded the steaming, elastic mix next to browned sausages, and I ate them together, spreading the aligot over sausage slices like a thick, savory sauce.", "Whether or not it is an entirely admirable thing, it is certainly an arresting thing that Tonke Dragt\u2019s THE LETTER FOR THE KING (Pushkin Children\u2019s Books, 512 pp., paper, $15.95; ages 10 and up), newly republished in English in a translation by Laura Watkinson, has as literal a title as has ever been imagined by an author for an adventure story. We expect the titles of children\u2019s classics to be deliberately intriguing, marked by an unexpected metaphysical juxtaposition \u2014 a witch meets a wardrobe \u2014 or at least to suggest an intriguing concept, time wrinkling or a philosopher\u2019s stone sought. But Dragt\u2019s book promises to be about a letter, for some king, and that is exactly its chief and only matter. The question is if it can be delivered or not.\n\nSince its publication more than 50 years ago, the book has sold millions of copies in Europe and been adapted as a movie; it is being developed as a series by Netflix. So the new reader coming to it must ask not if it works but how its mechanism runs \u2014 and, perhaps, whether it will run well for a generation of impatient, fantasy-besotted young American readers.\n\nThe answer is that the book is a fascinating exercise in exactly the poetic benefits \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the literalism that its title promises. There may never have been a book more shallowly written, more straightforwardly imagined, with minimal unexpected turns or true surprises. And yet the shallowness has a kind of handcrafted sweetness. To call its action wooden is merely to describe it, and not in a necessarily pejorative way. It is like watching well-made marionettes handled by a not entirely expert puppeteer: You see the strings, and the movement, yes, is jerky, but the action still has charm in its complete lack of pretension. If the reader responds with impatience at the simplicity, there is still satisfaction in a sound story so simply told.\n\nThe plot is introduced with little buildup. or back story. Tiuri, a young would-be knight in some vaguely medieval period in some clearly Northern clime, is interrupted during the vigil preceding his knighthood, when young squires were expected to stay up all night praying by candlelight in a chapel before the next day\u2019s ceremony. Though Tiuri is forbidden from opening the door, when an urgent knock is heard he does, and is hustled off by a hermit-squire who tells him to take a letter to the king at once. \u201cI have a letter here, with a message of vital importance. One might even say that the fate of an entire kingdom depends on it,\u201d he explains, directly. Tiuri, with oddly minimal resistance given that it will pull him away, perhaps for good, from his ambition to become a knight, goes off with the letter on a stolen horse. Though he is to deliver the letter to \u201cthe Black Knight with the White Shield,\u201d that knight is, no surprise, found grievously wounded \u2014 and it turns out Tiuri, no surprise again, will have to deliver the letter to the king himself.", "The spouses arriving for the Wednesday afternoon caregivers\u2019 class at the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia had something on their minds even before Alison Lynn, the social worker leading the session, could start the conversation.\n\nA few days before, retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor had released a letter announcing that she\u2019d been diagnosed with dementia, probably Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cAs this condition has progressed, I am no longer able to participate in public life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI want to be open about these changes, and while I am still able, share some personal thoughts.\u201d\n\nIt meant something to Ms. Lynn\u2019s participants that the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court would acknowledge, at 88, that she had the same relentless disease that was claiming their husbands and wives (and that killed Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s husband, too, in 2009).", "The UBS Global Wealth Management Chief Investment Office gamed out the various possibilities ahead of the election, concluding that such a sweep \u201cshould boost global stock markets, limit increases in long-term bond yields, and support the U.S. dollar.\u201d\n\nBut the \u201cbase case\u201d that UBS and most other analysts forecast ahead of the voting was what actually happened \u2014 a split decision producing gridlock. The real-world validation of so much consensus opinion tilted stock prices upward. And as I wrote last week, the markets have generally prospered after the midterms, regardless of which party has won.\n\nIn addition, despite substantial evidence to the contrary, there is a deep, stock-bolstering belief on Wall Street that gridlock \u2014 defined as a political alignment in which no single party controls all three branches of government \u2014 has been good for the market.\n\nBut the data bears this out only when a Democrat has been president and Republicans have held either the House or the Senate. Since 1901, in all such cases, the Dow Jones industrial average has outperformed its long-term average, an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group shows. When a Republican has been president during a stretch of gridlock, the market has lagged.\n\nIn the five previous congressional sessions since 1901 in which Republicans controlled the White House and the Senate while Democrats controlled the House \u2014 the political alignment in Washington starting in January \u2014 the annualized return has been a loss of 1.69 percent. That\u2019s not encouraging, though the data is too scanty to use \u201cas a blueprint for what to expect this time around,\u201d Bespoke said.\n\nThe IHS Markit analysis predicted a \u201clegislative impasse\u201d in the new Congress but reserved the possibility of deals on big issues. And several analysts said these might be an infrastructure rebuilding program, measures to reduce prescription drug prices or an agreement to help the so-called Dreamers. These are the young undocumented immigrants who have benefited from an Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, but face the possibility of deportation under current Trump administration policies.\n\nBut President Trump could demand that a deal on the Dreamers be paired with funding for his coveted border wall, an objective that many Democrats abhor.", "To the Editor:\n\nRe \u201c12 Slain by California Gunman\u201d (front page, Nov. 9):\n\nWe don\u2019t know the motives of the killer, but we do know that he went immediately for the security guard (the \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d).

As the trailer makes clear, this isn\u2019t a Disney-style, kid-friendly take on the story but a darker version \u2014 hence the PG-13 rating.

She separated from her husband, and is now romantically involved with Fabio Anselmo, her family\u2019s lawyer, whom she hired to take her brother\u2019s case. His first piece of advice to her had been to have photographs taken during the autopsy.\n\nThose graphic images, which show evident bruising on Stefano\u2019s face and back, did much to sway public opinion. She has brandished the photos on several occasions to draw attention to the case when it risked slipping into general indifference or when the narrative became distorted because of her brother\u2019s past drug use.\n\nIn her transformation from mother and wife to public figure, Ms. Cucchi has taken to writing: a book about her brother, a blog in the Italian edition of HuffPost and a Facebook account with more than 387,000 likes that chronicles the ins and outs of the complicated case.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot. It shows that people are tired of a justice system\u201d that does not look out for the powerless, she said. \u201cThe state has to stop protecting itself and start protecting citizens.\u201d\n\nShe is often suggested as a political hopeful, but after one unsuccessful run for office she claims to have no further aspirations. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing politics, fighting for the rights of the least powerful for the past nine years,\u201d she said.\n\nThe trial of the five carabinieri involved in Stefano\u2019s arrest now playing out in a Rome courtroom is colloquially known as the Cucchi-bis trial. Three of them have been charged with involuntary manslaughter, the other two with slander and making false statements.

In this outing, Walt and Gus, making their rounds, see a car skid into a snow-filled ditch. Can they help? Despite his can-do spirit, Walt must now learn to deal with his limitations: \u201cMy plow is tough, / but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d The, from over the horizon, appears Mo the Tow, driven by \u201cthe lady in blue \u2014 Sue.\u201d (Are women in blue a trend?) Mo and Sue are the pair with the hardware and skills to perform this rescue \u2014 except it turns out they can\u2019t quite reach the stranded car; first they\u2019ll need some snow cleared. Are Walt and Gus up to it? No spoliers. Suffice to say all these characters have something useful they like to do and that they do well, and each has limits, too, making this a story about teamwork as well as pluck. Verdick and Rosenthal may not be clearing new ground with these lessons, but what they plow, they plow well. The characters are appealing, and the language is active and satisfying, with plenty of onomatopoeia. Good luck saying RUGGAROOOM BRUMMAHUM 10 times fast, but your audience will enjoy hearing you try.\n\nThe flap copy tells us that \u201cSmall Walt\u201d has been called \u201creminiscent of Virginia Burton\u2019s classics,\u201d and this book will be, too; the cover design practically dares you not to think of \u201cMike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel.\u201d Rosenthal\u2019s drawings feel like a contemporary take on Burton\u2019s spirit, though, rather than something derivative: Burton, after an espresso. The lines and colors are direct, cheerful and effective. They look like the work of someone in a good mood, and it put me in a good mood to look at them.\n\nJ. M. Brum and Jan Bajtlik\u2019s OUR CAR (Neal Porter/Roaring Brook, 32 pp., $16.99; ages 2 to 6) introduces a father, a son and the little red car they love. The drawings are digital, done in bold colors and simple shapes. (I might have guessed pastel, had one image not been recolored and reused multiple times on the title page and opening spread.) Father, the driver, and son, the passenger, are presences more than characters, just enough there to help us project ourselves into the book. \u201cOur Car\u201d has little interest in the actual mechanics of automobiles, yet it cuts, joyfully, straight to the things that thrill about cars; the book is a distilled dose of speed and color.

Clearly, the attorney general of the United States is a principal officer, and so the president could not permanently fill that post without the Senate\u2019s advice and consent. The argument against Mr. Whitaker\u2019s appointment rises and falls on the assumption that someone who temporarily exercises the duties of a principal officer must be a principal officer \u2014 or at the very least, an \u201cinferior officer\u201d like the deputy attorney general or solicitor general, who have already been confirmed by the Senate to those posts.\n\nBut in an 1898 decision, United States v. Eaton, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that only a principal officer confirmed by the Senate can temporarily fill the shoes of another principal officer. So long as an inferior officer is exercising the duties of the principal officer \u201cfor a limited time, and under special and temporary conditions,\u201d the court said, he \u201cis not thereby transformed into the superior and permanent official.\u201d The Supreme Court in Eaton did not go on to define what \u201ca limited time\u201d or \u201cspecial and temporary conditions\u201d entails, but it made clear that those are the key constitutional considerations.\n\nIn the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, Congress elaborated on those missing pieces. When a senior executive branch officer \u201cdies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office,\u201d the statute authorizes the president to choose either that official\u2019s \u201cfirst assistant\u201d (in this case, Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein); any other currently serving government officer who was confirmed by the Senate; or any senior official, like Mr. Whitaker, who served in the same department as the vacant office for at least 90 of the previous 365 days \u201cto perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity.\u201d\n\nA separate provision of the statute limits that designation to 210 days, unless the president nominates a permanent successor in the interim. Other laws distinguish between those duties Mr. Whitaker may carry out as acting attorney general and those limited to an attorney general confirmed by the Senate. For instance, the acting attorney general is expressly allowed to sign an application for a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act but is expressly excluded from the line of succession to the presidency.", "To the Editor:\n\nI had to read Daniel McCarthy\u2019s Nov. 5 essay, \u201cThe G.O.P.

Mr. Obama campaigned energetically for Democratic candidates in the midterms, and Mrs. Obama has launched a new education project for adolescent girls and an initiative to promote voter registration and turnout. Now, she is about to travel the country on a 10-city book tour organized by Live Nation, the world\u2019s largest concert promoter. At promotional events in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and elsewhere, Mrs. Obama will appear at sports stadiums with high profile moderators like Oprah Winfrey, Sarah Jessica Parker, Reese Witherspoon and Valerie Jarrett. (In some venues, front row seats with a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d package are priced at $3,000; 10 percent of the tickets in each city are being given away to local charities, schools, and community groups.)\n\n[ Read The Times\u2019s review of Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cBecoming.\u201d ]\n\nWith the publication of \u201cBecoming,\u201d the Obamas now seem set to make their mark not just in politics, but in popular culture. Last year, they announced a joint book deal with Penguin Random House that was rumored to exceed $60 million, a large portion of which is going to their foundation and other charities. This year, they signed a multiyear production deal with Netflix, to produce films and television shows through their company, \u201cHigher Ground Productions.\u201d (They recently acquired screen rights to Michael Lewis\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Fifth Risk,\u201d for their company.)\n\n\u201cBecoming,\u201d which The New York Times received a copy of, is in many ways a fairly conventional first lady\u2019s memoir: An insider\u2019s view of what it was like to live through national tragedies and other major events, in one of the most high-profile positions in the world. She describes the highs and lows of her husband\u2019s eight years in office, like learning the gutting news of the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Conn., and how her husband summoned her to his side for comfort, something he rarely did during work hours, and the moment he told her that the mission to kill Osama bin Laden was successful.\n\nBut as the first African-American first lady, Mrs. Obama\u2019s experience was far from typical, and she writes about feeling greater scrutiny than her predecessors.", "Tim Federle, who co-wrote the musical \u201cTuck Everlasting\u201d and the movie \u201cFerdinand,\u201d knows the territory of being a misunderstood theater kid. As a teenager, he escaped his hometown to come to New York City to pursue a Broadway career. His novel \u201cBetter Nate Than Ever\u201d told the story of Nate Foster, an eighth grader who steals his mom\u2019s A.T.M. card and his brother\u2019s fake ID and boards a bus to try out for a Broadway musical version of \u201cE.T.\u201d Next came \u201cFive, Six, Seven, Nate!,\u201d in which Nate lands an ensemble role, moves to New York and prepares for opening night. Now the series comes to an end with NATE EXPECTATIONS (Simon & Schuster, 256 pp., $17.99; ages 10 to 14), which tackles what happens after your dream comes true: The show closes after bad reviews. As with his earlier books, Federle skillfully pivots between the comedic commentary and the moving introspection of a boy trying to find his place in a homophobic world.\n\nImage\n\nAfter experiencing the freedom to be himself \u2014 as well as a secret romance with a castmate \u2014 Nate Foster has to go back to Jankburg, Pa., \u201ca town that somehow both never knew my name but also hated everything about me.\u201d To make things worse, the high school auditorium is being torn down to build a lacrosse field. Undeterred in his love of the theater, Nate sets out to stage a musical production of \u201cGreat Expectations\u201d in the gym, and instead of getting ostracized, he gains fans among students and administrators alike. \u201cSome days you\u2019re a freshman in high school, and though the world is a bubble of suck, inside the bubble you\u2019ve made something rare and beautiful,\u201d Nate observes. Readers will feel reassured that Nate will survive high school and go on to pursue his passion with confidence.\n\n\u201cZora was bold and honest like a bumblebee asking to nectar on springtime flowers, and loud and fearless like a bobcat,\u201d says 12-year-old Carrie Brown, the narrator of the beautifully written ZORA AND ME: THE CURSED GROUND (Candlewick, 250 pp., $16.99; ages 10 and up), by T. R. Simon. In this second book in a promised series that imagines the life of the young Zora Neale Hurston, Zora and her friend Carrie solve a murder in their town of Eatonville, Fla., in the early 1900s. Although Eatonville is the first black incorporated town in America, Zora and Carrie are hardly shielded from the racial violence of the post-Reconstruction era. In \u201cZora and Me: The Cursed Ground,\u201d the two girls learn about the enslaved history of some of their town\u2019s inhabitants and the ongoing legacy of that bloody bondage.\n\nImage\n\nWhen Zora and Carrie stumble upon an old slave plantation house in 1903, they can hardly imagine a world where people are treated like property. But then two white men ride into town claiming that the land should never have been incorporated into Eatonville. Zora\u2019s father, who is Eatonville\u2019s mayor, is forced to take a stance. \u201cThe past is coming for us, isn\u2019t it?\u201d her mother asks. \u201cWhite men with lynching ropes will hang us from trees here as easily as they did in Alabama. We were foolish to think that there could ever be a safe place, that we could ever get away.\u201d The land in question holds a dark secret, one told in flashbacks from a healer named Old Lady Bronson that slowly connect the past with the present. The flashbacks vividly depict Old Lady Bronson\u2019s life as a young girl when she was taken from Hispaniola to Florida to work on the plantation. The connection between slave times and Zora and Carrie\u2019s world unravels slowly and with well-crafted suspense and a horrifying surprise twist. \u201cHistory wasn\u2019t just something you read in a book,\u201d Carrie observes. \u201cIt was everything your life stood on. We who thought we were free from the past were still living it out.\u201d", "A momo is a dumpling, and yet.\n\nThe definition is technically correct but almost a diminishment. Momos may be plump as pincushions, swelling at the seams; or half-moons pleated so meticulously, they look carved; or hulks, furrowed and looming, small-scale analogues to the Himalayan peaks where they were born.\n\nWhatever the dumplings\u2019 size, their skins are delicate enough that, when steamed, the shadow of the filling shows through: sometimes meat, sometimes a jade pulse of chives, but always seething, with juices on the run.\n\nAnd then there are the deep-fried momos at Momo Crave, just off the 7 train on the border of Woodside and Jackson Heights, Queens. They are dark orange-red globes with skins gone crisp, thrust on a skewer like tandoori chicken. They also taste like tandoori chicken, earthy and fervid, with a cool touch of yogurt and swallowed smoke from the grill.", "At Momo Crave on the border of Woodside and Jackson Heights, Queens, momos (dumplings) come deep-fried and thrust on skewers, tasting earthy and fervid, like tandoori chicken.", "If you can afford to, increasing your contributions by 1 percentage point each year \u2014 say, from 5 percent of your salary to 6 percent \u2014 can make a big difference in the long run, said Brendan Mullooly, a financial planner in Wall Township, N.J.\n\nSteven Brett, president of Marcum Financial Services in New York, offered this additional advice: \u201cStart as early as possible and take advantage of compounding and time. The earlier you do it, the less you have to put away.\u201d\n\nIf your employer doesn\u2019t offer a retirement plan, you can open an individual retirement account. Contribution limits to I.R.A.s are also increasing next year, for the first time in five years. For 2019, you can contribute up to $6,000, an increase of $500. People 50 and older can save an extra $1,000, for a total of $7,000.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about retirement savings:\n\nIs it too late to contribute more to my 401(k) for 2018?\n\nMarina Edwards, a senior director of retirement with Willis Towers Watson, suggested that workers ask their human resources department to provide an estimate of what their contributions will be for this year. If they haven\u2019t met this year\u2019s maximum contribution of $18,500, and can afford to put away more money, they may want to consider increasing their payroll contributions.\n\nIs it better to contribute to my 401(k), or to a health savings account?\n\nContribute to both if you are eligible, Ms. Edwards said. H.S.A.s are special savings accounts available to people with certain high-deductible health insurance plans. Their \u201ctriple tax\u201d benefit makes them an excellent way to save, she said. Money goes in tax free, grows tax free and is withdrawn tax free, when the money is spent on eligible health and medical expenses.\n\nMany people confuse H.S.A.s with flexible health spending accounts, which are geared toward short-term health needs, Ms. Edwards said. You can use the money in an H.S.A. for current health needs if you must, but letting it grow long term is smart, she said, since most people will have health needs in retirement.\n\nMs. Edwards suggests a three-step approach: Contribute to your 401(k) up to the company match. Then fund your H.S.A., to the maximum if possible. (For 2018, individuals can contribute up to $3,450; the total rises to $3,500 in 2019. The limit for catch-up contributions by those 55 and older remains $1,000.)", "The structure of the investment is novel. The zones aim to entice people who, after years of increases in the value of their investments, have a lot of \u201cembedded gains,\u201d or taxes that would be owed if those holdings were sold.\n\nInvestors can put those profits into opportunity zone funds, which will invest in businesses and real estate in these designated areas. In return, the investors will get various tax breaks on both the investment they sold and the one they made in the opportunity zone.\n\nIf they maintain their investment for five years, they\u2019ll get a 10 percent break on the capital gains tax they would owe today; if the investment lasts seven years, the reduction is 15 percent. When the investment in the opportunity zone hits 10 years, the gains on that investment are tax free.\n\nInvesting in these zones would seem like a win-win. But not all opportunity zones are the same, and the tax incentive could also keep investors from being sufficiently rigorous with their due diligence.\n\nFor starters, some of the zones are a stretch to qualify as neighborhoods in need of help. In Connecticut, South Norwalk, a bustling restaurants and arts area, is on the list. So are East Austin, Tex., where property taxes are rising quickly as property values soar, and Oakland, Calif., which is becoming San Francisco\u2019s younger, hipper sibling.\n\nThere are investors who plan to focus on the edges of opportunity zones. Among them are Avy Stein, a co-founder of Cresset Capital Management, and Larry Levy, a real estate investor and a founder of Levy Family Partners, who have teamed up to raise a $500 million fund. Mr. Stein said one of the criteria is that the investments would need to have been worthy without the tax break.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to identify those areas where, with a substantial amount of capital, those communities can change,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to put money into areas where the capital won\u2019t come out.\u201d", "At oral arguments, her questioning is pointed and betrays detailed familiarity with the parties\u2019 legal arguments and the record in the case.\n\nShe often talks about her workouts with a trainer, whom she has called \u201cmy physical fitness guardian since 1999.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg was named to the court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She was the first Democratic appointment since 1967, when President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Thurgood Marshall.\n\nJustice Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn in 1933, graduated from Cornell in 1954 and began law school at Harvard. After moving to New York with her husband, she transferred to Columbia, where she earned her law degree.\n\nShe taught at Columbia and Rutgers and was a leading courtroom advocate of women\u2019s rights before joining the court. As director of the Women\u2019s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1970s, she brought a series of cases before the court that helped establish constitutional protections against sex discrimination.\n\nHer litigation strategy invited comparison to that of Justice Marshall, who was the architect of the civil rights movement\u2019s incremental legal attack on racial discrimination before he joined the court.\n\nIn a 2016 interview, she was critical of President Trump in the midst of the presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be \u2014 with Donald Trump as our president,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the country, it could be four years.

To determine menstrual pain, they asked women whether they had ever taken prescription or over-the-counter medication to prevent menstrual cramps or pelvic pain.\n\nAbout 13 percent of the women reported being fed soy formula as babies. They were significantly more likely than those who had not been fed soy formulas to have used hormonal contraception for menstrual pain, especially in the first five years after menarche.\n\nThe precise mechanism is unknown, but soy contains phytoestrogens that have been shown in animal studies to affect uterine development and adult uterine function.", "NEW YORK \u2014 Wall Street's three major stock indexes lost ground on Friday, after a week of recovery from the October sell-off, as oil prices fell further and more evidence of a slowing Chinese economy was reported.\n\nOil prices fell nearly 1.0 percent on Friday, and have now seen the longest stretch of daily declines since 1984, on rising global supply and evidence of a slowing world economy.\n\nThe United States formally imposed punitive sanctions on Iran this week, but granted eight countries temporary waivers allowing them to keep buying oil from the Islamic Republic.\n\n\"Oil is spooking the market.

But Madison\u2019s fear turned on the assumption that members of Congress, seeking power, would be loyal to their branch of government first. By providing a mechanism for cooperation rather than conflict across branches, political parties undermine that assumption. One of the profound ironies of American constitutional history is that Madison served as the great theorist of both the separation of powers and the party system. His Federalist 51 said the separation of powers would be maintained by institutional loyalty. But when the Constitution came into force, he observed a need to create political parties to organize public opinion against what he feared was becoming an abusive regime.\n\nToday, neither party defends congressional prerogatives. Nancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, declared that one of their first priorities in power would be to disclose President Trump\u2019s tax returns: \u201cThat\u2019s the easiest thing in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing.\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who was then leading Republicans in the minority, remarked in 2010 that \u201cthe single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d Mr. McConnell was derided for partisanship but not for the denigration of Congress implicit in the suggestion that its most important function was to h assle the president.\n\nThe challenge now is for House Democrats to seize the reins of governance not because they are Democrats but because they are members of Congress \u2014 a branch of government that is more contemplative, less impulsive and more subtly reflective of the broad range of perspectives in American politics than a presidency with which one either agrees or disagrees. This is not about which party governs. Congressional majorities come and go. The question is which understanding of the Constitution prevails. Constitutional conservatives have traditionally valued the role of Congress over that of the presidency because it is more cautious and more prone to deliberation before acting. Congressional government is also better suited to overcoming our polarized politics because it better accommodates a range of views.\n\nThat does not mean Democrats shouldn\u2019t investigate where doing so serves their institutional rather than partisan interests. Congress must often investigate to gather information for legislating or to ensure legislation is being properly executed. A truly independent legislature would not outsource investigations like the one being led by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, into the 2016 election. It would jealously use its ample authority to conduct them itself. Still, while oversight and investigation are vital roles of Congress, they are aids to its primary function of legislating.\n\nSuccess in legislation, in turn, will require the fortitude to exploit Madison\u2019s power of the purse and the flexibility to work with Republicans to restore legislative governance. If your party controls a single chamber of Congress, this power can be exercised negatively, such as by refusing to fund priorities of Mr. Trump like a border wall. But that negative power can also be deployed affirmatively by leveraging it to force compromise on, for example, a comprehensive approach to immigration. By contrast, prioritizing investigation alone would make legislating harder while suggesting that the real prize is not exercising Congress\u2019s power right now but recapturing the White House in 2020. We need to play the long constitutional game, not the short electoral one. That game is about restoring legislative governance.\n\nFor their part, Republicans must elevate loyalty to Congress over fealty to a president of their own party. That may sound implausible, but if it is, the Constitution is already lost. As long as House Republicans see themselves as adjuncts of the White House, Congress will remain in orbit around a presidency at the center. If they decide there is nothing to gain in doing so, they must ask \u2014 as must Democrats who reach the same conclusion \u2014 the Madisonian question: Why seek a job obsessively only to perform it submissively?\n\nLegislating from the limited position of House Democrats will not be effortless, nor should it be. The Constitution is designed not to facilitate easy decisions but to defer them until the public view, now volatile and divided, is settled. Congress should be judged not by the volume of its output but by its representation of the public\u2019s views and its defense of its institutional authority.", "What\u2019s it like to be plunked down in a world of general weirdness? That\u2019s the question that drives the Australian author-illustrator Tan, who in 2011 won the lucrative (500,000 euros!) international Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award. He asks the question soberly, laconically, in TALES FROM THE INNER CITY (Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic, 219 pp., $24.99; ages 10 and up), a collection of 25 illustrated prose poems and short stories about the relations of animals and people. In \u201cShark\u201d \u2014 the table of contents page is simply a spread of animal silhouettes with numbers on them, so I\u2019m approximating here \u2014 the townspeople have gathered in celebration of the capture and slaughter of their monstrous finned foe, only to discover that each slice of the fisherman\u2019s blade reveals more sharks, \u201cspilling out like Russian dolls, smaller and smaller, hundreds, thousands, each unborn generation as fresh and blue as water before they rolled out into the blood and gore of their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents.\u201d \u201cMoonfish\u201d imagines a dystopia in which the only unpolluted-enough element left for the fish is the sky. \u201cLungfish\u201d portrays the species evolving to colonize a city in a way its human inhabitants never quite managed. While all the scenarios are original and vivid, the stories tend toward the brief and cryptic (one is about giant snails found \u201cmaking love right then and there\u201d in the streets) or the overlong and overwritten (some of the sentences in \u201cShark\u201d clock in at more than 75 words). But the prose isn\u2019t why you\u2019re here.\n\nWhat you came for are the pictures. Each story gets at least one, a wordless, full-bleed double-page spread that illustrates, extravagantly, either a large motif or an offhand moment from its story in richly textured paint. Those snails kiss under the noir glow of sodium vapor streetlights while a hooded guitarist serenades them from the subway below. A sweet (if wordy) tale of the death of a beloved cat shows him giant-size, carrying his vulnerable human family between his ears as he keeps them afloat in a raging sea. A tormented young genius dreams only of hippos; the pictured hippo shifts from our-world gray to all the colors of the universe in the boy\u2019s imagination.", "Though the idea has received some bipartisan support, critics aren\u2019t optimistic that dangling a tax credit in front of employers will go far enough. Anna Chu, vice president for strategy and policy at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said tax credits rarely prodded businesses \u2014 particularly those that employ lower-income workers \u2014 to create a new benefit.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is you are simply rewarding businesses who are already doing this,\u201d she said.\n\nExpansion of Medical Expense Tax Deductions\n\nThe problem it could help solve: Ever-rising out-of-pocket health care costs.\n\nWhat it would mean for you: When they began to rewrite the tax code last year, Republicans\u2019 opening gambit was to do away with tax deductions for medical expenses. But that prompted howls of outrage from people with disabilities, parents of special-needs children and older Americans (whose nursing home costs are generally deductible).\n\nRepublicans reversed themselves, and then some: The final bill allows people to deduct any such costs that exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income; the previous threshold was 10 percent.\n\nThere is a catch, though: That 7.5 percent was only for 2017 and 2018. Next year, absent legislative action, the hurdle will revert to 10 percent. If that happens, it will feel uncomfortably like a tax increase on the old and the sick. So look for a compromise here, too.\n\nElimination of Surprise Medical Bills\n\nThe problem it could help solve: While the Affordable Care Act generally caps what consumers must spend out of pocket when using providers in their plan\u2019s network, it doesn\u2019t protect consumers from large bills from outside providers. Those providers may be free to charge the consumer for the balance of the bill that the insurer did not pay, known as balance billing. In some cases, those charges can run into six figures.\n\nWhat it would mean for you: A proposed bill with bipartisan support would help patients in a few different situations. For example, you\u2019d be responsible only for what you would pay under your insurance plan when treated for an emergency by an out-of-network provider at an out-of-network facility. The same logic would apply if you were treated at a hospital in your plan\u2019s network but saw a doctor who was out of network.", "With the leather sofa and the globe, the room feels very clubby.\n\nI love gentlemen\u2019s clubs.

She remembered an afternoon of playing alligator with Esperanza in a dirty pool, trying to open her eyes underwater, the ferocity of that sting. She\u2019d always end up clenching her eyes shut, as tightly as they were shut now. \u201cIf we were gators,\u201d Esperanza had told her that day, \u201cmy tail would be longer than yours. Because I\u2019m taller.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot by much,\u201d Alma had argued. But she\u2019d been inconsolably jealous.\n\nAndrew Holleran\n\nThe minute their car was in the water, the twins felt a bump, a gentle nudge beneath the chassis, and when they looked down, they saw a pod of dolphins pushing them across Biscayne Bay.

Esperanza was sure they\u2019d find the womb beneath the world that the manatee told them they must visit to remove the curse. But Esperanza couldn\u2019t decide as she swam through the crystal-clear water ahead of her sister if she wanted to grow old.\n\nWhat was the point, given the way Florida \u2014 and the planet itself \u2014 was going?

Meanwhile, just ahead was an enormous cavern that had to be the womb beneath the world \u2014 only above the entrance a line of lights spelled out the words \u201cThe Walt Disney Company.\u201d", "That Inkling represents the father\u2019s spirit instead of the son\u2019s is a stirring choice. Ethan conceals Inkling from his father at first \u2014 literally, protecting a piece of his father\u2019s soul from him, until Ethan crumbles under the pressure. \u201cA secret was a heavy thing to carry around for so long,\u201d he laments, \u201cand day by day it only got heavier.\u201d Ethan is a stand-in for every child who must take on the role of parent to sustain a family. But part of what Ethan has to learn is that his father\u2019s failings aren\u2019t his own; the more Ethan tries to parent Inkling, the more it metastasizes. When the monstrous blotch is finally devoured, we feel Ethan\u2019s relief, his father\u2019s soul no longer his ward.\n\nImage\n\nEthan\u2019s father is known only as Dad, but in Christopher Healy\u2019s A PERILOUS JOURNEY OF DANGER & MAYHEM: A DASTARDLY PLOT (Walden Pond Press, 384 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), Mom has a name: Cassandra Pepper, a manic, stargazing inventor in 1883 New York, who seems to be less mother to her 12-year-old daughter, Molly, and more ball-and-chain. Molly\u2019s father is dead, but his ghost looms large: He had \u201cpromised his beloved Cassandra she would never have to give up on her dream\u201d of rivaling Thomas Edison or Nikola Tesla. After her father\u2019s death, then, Molly quits school and becomes her mother\u2019s assistant, refusing \u201cto let her father become a liar.\u201d Determined to showcase Cassandra\u2019s flying contraption at the World Fair, only to be thwarted by the all-male Inventors\u2019 Guild, Molly soon uncovers the dastardly plot of the title, a death machine targeting the entire city, which Molly and her mother must team up to defuse.\n\nWith the help of allies, including a Chinese boy named Emmett (\u201cWe don\u2019t have the best reputation around here,\u201d he sighs, fully aware of anti-immigrant sentiment), Molly tracks down the suspected assassins. One by one, the clues point toward famous inventors \u2014 Alexander Graham Bell, Edison himself \u2014 which gives young readers a chance to meet and exonerate each one before the chase begins again. But amid Healy\u2019s whip-smart banter and well-hewed cameos (including appearances by several unsung female inventors), a thorny question takes hold. Unlike Ethan, who struggles valiantly to not be his parents, Molly is her mother\u2019s proxy. Indeed, Molly exists so purely to serve Cassandra\u2019s hopes, Cassandra\u2019s dreams, Cassandra\u2019s future, that even mother and daughter are left wondering at book\u2019s end: What does Molly want?\n\nImage\n\nMolly has much in common with Mel in Matt Phelan\u2019s illustrated KNIGHTS VS. DINOSAURS (Greenwillow, 160 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), a squire for the knight Bors, \u201ca brute in shining armor\u201d who initially has no clue his liege is a girl. At King Arthur\u2019s Round Table, where the pair are in service, knights act as their squires\u2019 exclusive guardians, which means Mel\u2019s parents are out of the picture and Bors is, essentially, her dad. Testing knight and squire \u2014 along with the rest of Arthur\u2019s knights \u2014 is a forest full of Jurassic beasts. Whether jousting with a triceratops or facing down a T-rex, Mel should come with a halo: She\u2019s thoughtful, sensitive and wise, \u201calways thinking, planning, preparing.\u201d Parenting her seems to require little more than staying out of her way. Not that Bors seems equipped for the role, insisting a female squire is an affront to his dignity and the natural order, where \u201cMight Makes Right.\u201d", "UBS\u2019s spurning of the settlement is partly based on a wager that the courts will decide that the bank was foolish rather than dishonest. As well as losing money that belonged to investors, the bank also itself invested in 39 of the 40 mortgage-backed securities cited by the Justice Department, and suffered $900 million of its own losses, according to the bank. All told, UBS eventually suffered $45 billion of losses in the market. And it never originated the mortgages but merely packaged and sold them on.\n\nSo UBS joins a small club of European lenders that have pushed back against U.S. prosecutors. Barclays gives it some hope: it also spurned a settlement before negotiating a lower fine.\n\nAn ongoing trial in France over whether UBS helped French clients evade taxes adds piquancy to Mr. Ermotti\u2019s U.S. rebuttal. French prosecutors have called for a 3.7 billion euro fine.\n\nGiven UBS\u2019s Tier 1 capital ratio, a common measure of a bank\u2019s financial health, stands at a robust 13.5 percent and its shares trade above the tangible book value of the company, Mr. Ermotti can arguably afford to be confrontational. Still, if authorities in France and the United States get half of what they called for, amounting to around 3.1 billion Swiss francs, then UBS\u2019s capital ratio would drop to 12.3 percent \u2014 healthy enough, but below its 13 percent target. More worrying, its leverage ratio would drop to the regulatory minimum of 3.5 percent, imperiling a 2 billion Swiss franc share buyback.\n\nMr. Ermotti is confident enough that won\u2019t happen, not least because HSBC settled its own French tax evasion probe last year for just 300 million euros. Besides, UBS is on track to generate around 2 billion Swiss francs of organic capital this year, potentially providing some additional loss-absorbing protection.", "It may be best to approach MALLKO AND DAD (Enchanted Lion, 120 pp., $19.95; ages 6 and up) as a picture book that\u2019s not really for children, or at least not for children to read on their own. It\u2019s a book that seems aimed at helping parents of children with special needs \u2014 and perhaps those children themselves, as well as their typically developing siblings \u2014 come to terms with their shared lives. Through a playful blending of words and drawings (conveyed in a smooth English translation by Mara Faye Lethem), the illustrator Gusti, who was born in Argentina and now lives in Barcelona, offers an autobiographical account \u2014 part sketchbook, part collage and part fragmentary story \u2014 of how he, his wife and their older son dealt with the fact that his younger son, Mallko, was born with Down syndrome.\n\nThe sentence \u201cI did not accept him\u201d sprawls in giant, heavy, capital letters across a spread early in the book. Toward the end, typed small below an indecipherable but nonetheless endearing drawing presumably by Mallko, Gusti writes, \u201cKids with Down syndrome are an endangered species.\u201d These two sentences span the journey the book takes from Gusti\u2019s early fear and confusion over Mallko\u2019s condition to his blossoming awareness of how rare, precious and wonderful his son is.\n\nSometimes Gusti\u2019s pictures feel almost manic, splashed all over the pages, which are treated like open canvases. There are photorealistic drawings in colored pencil, anxious pictures in pen, and countless cartoons and comic panels. Taken together, this assortment of styles represents a mind shuttling between feelings of love, fear, uncertainty, hope and gratitude \u2014 a dizzying cocktail that may feel familiar to many parents.\n\nImage\n\nDown syndrome, for Gusti, becomes an opportunity to examine and more deeply inhabit his love for his son, whose world, as Gusti illustrates it, is filled with wonder. For instance, amid a sketchbook-like series of drawings of Gusti and Mallko riding tricycles, Gusti writes, \u201cEvery day I tell myself: Don\u2019t forget to play.\u201d In one of those drawings, Mallko looks directly at the reader with a piercingly curious gaze, as if asking: \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? C\u2019mon, let\u2019s do something fun.\u201d Dozens of images of Mallko drawn in every imaginable mood beckon the reader into his illuminated world.", "Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamation is a radical departure from that tradition. With the exception of children arriving without parents, officials said that all migrants who cross illegally would automatically be denied asylum. Advocates for migrants condemned the policy shift as meanspirited and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIssuing a presidential proclamation effectively denying vulnerable families protection from violence is contrary to our laws and values,\u201d said Kevin Appleby, a senior director at the Center for Migration Studies. \u201cIn the long run, it will not deter asylum seekers who are fleeing for their lives. On this one, the emperor has no clothes.\u201d\n\nAcross the world, nations have for years agreed to consider asylum protections for those fleeing violence and persecution, even if they cross borders illegally. Human rights advocates said on Friday that the United States should be a leader in supporting that idea.\n\n\u201cOne thing that unites a majority of Americans is a belief in the principle of asylum,\u201d Ali Noorani, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said in a statement. \u201cEroding that principle means eroding a defining value of our nation.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials insisted that the new rules would remain consistent with United States obligations to the rest of the world because seeking asylum is not the only way for someone fleeing persecution to receive protection.\n\nOfficials said migrants would be allowed to seek other protections if they could prove a risk of being tortured in their home countries. However, they conceded that those claims were purposely much harder to prove and that fewer people were likely to qualify to stay in the United States than would have by receiving asylum. The only way to seek asylum will be to arrive at an official border crossing.\n\nBut officials conceded that many of the crossings from Mexico into the United States \u2014 known as ports of entry \u2014 were over capacity and already had trouble processing the number of asylum claims being made by migrants there. Under the new policy, many more are expected to arrive at the crossings.", "These five new picture books are human-size stories made by human hands. The evidence: raw brush strokes, bleeding paint, pencil marks left untouched. Somehow that makes all the difference as the young characters in these stories try to find their way into the confusing adult world. The handmade artistry of these books helps to illuminate and animate children\u2019s feelings of wonder, loss and determination.\n\nThe story in JiHyeon Lee\u2019s wordless DOOR (Chronicle, 56 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8) starts on the frontispiece: A boy finds a key. A strange little insect leads him wandering among gray, drab people to a cobweb-draped door, apparently unopened for years. On the other side, they enter a land of blossoming trees, fantastical creatures, polka-dot food. The boy slowly sheds his grayness for pink, red and green. A bit Alice in Wonderland; but, truly, JiHyeon Lee, who gave us the delightful \u201cPool\u201d (also wordless), is a unique and wildly imaginative talent \u2014 an original. The illustrations, in pencil, are whimsical, reserved, buoyant, childlike, expert. In a remarkable six-page layout of doors and doors and doors, we see worlds connect and intersect as creatures enter and exit, laughing, playing, even getting married. Language (dialogue is drawn in nonsense squiggles) isn\u2019t a barrier. Neither are appearances. This land is a joyous celebration of differences and likenesses and harmony \u2014 and so is this magical book.\n\nHow could you not love a deliciously pink elephant named Poe?

In POE WON\u2019T GO (Disney-Hyperion, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), written by Kelly DiPucchio and illustrated by Zachariah OHora, a rather large elephant has plunked himself right in the middle of the only road in town. This is a delightful children\u2019s fable in the form of a humorous news story. The colorful illustrations look like retro linocut prints, while the hand-drawn text brings to life the atmosphere of panic in Prickly Valley. The townspeople try everything to get rid of Poe: They attempt to bribe him with cheese, they hire a magician to make him disappear, they tie a hundred balloons to his limbs. The mayor arrives with her committees and councils and Styrofoam cups and real-life politics.\n\nIn the end, throwing everything at the problem does not solve it \u2014 a little kindness does. It comes in the shape of a small girl, Marigold. She saves the day by asking Poe why he won\u2019t go (in elephant of course). For the first time, Poe smiles. Marigold puts her ear to his forehead, listens carefully, then explains, \u201cHe\u2019s waiting for a friend.\u201d The friend is a monkey wearing a polka-dot tie. Poe tips his black fedora and leaves with the monkey on his shoulder.

George Baldwin McCoy, my great-grand-uncle. He was killed on July 20, 1918, leading a charge against German machine guns during the Second Battle of the Marne. He was 25. I stood next to my father in the wheat field before dawn while he peered at a laminated map using a flashlight, on the 100th anniversary of when Lieutenant McCoy\u2019s unit launched their attack, down to the minute. After a long moment of silence and reflection, we loaded back into the car and drove forward a few hundred yards to the farmhouse where Lieutenant McCoy was mortally wounded. We then retraced his steps to the field hospital, and then found the graveyard where my ancestor was temporarily buried. Through my father\u2019s research, we had learned that my great-great-grandfather Judge Walter Irving McCoy campaigned to bring home the bodies of his son and other fallen Americans. When he finally succeeded, the Army accidentally chopped the feet off Lieutenant McCoy\u2019s corpse with a shovel, making the family fear that the corpse was not actually their son. A furious Judge McCoy proceeded to raise hell, prompting congressional hearings and an investigation by the Army.

John A. Olien, my great-uncle, was killed by German machine gunners, but the family never learned of the circumstances. In 1918, they celebrated the armistice on Nov. 11 not knowing John had been killed. Notification of his death arrived in early December. I eventually found the history of John\u2019s unit in the University of Michigan library. He charged the German lines with his captain and a handful of other men. They captured three outposts before they realized they were surrounded on three sides. His captain was killed, and John was critically wounded, lying on the battlefield, tended by a fellow soldier until both were captured by the Germans. John died while German medics were taking him to an aid station. In 1921, my family chose to bring John\u2019s remains home to be interred on the highest hill of a rural cemetery near New Richmond, Wis. When I was young, I visited the grave site with my grandfather on Memorial Day, on John\u2019s birthday, on the anniversary of his death and every Nov. 11.

There\u2019s a small gym in my building. It makes it so easy.\n\n3 p.m. Launch sweepstakes announcements for \u201cEverything\u2019s Trash\u201d book launch. I\u2019m feeling good about the book. I think it\u2019s better than the first one and I hope that people like it. At this point, you just sort of have to accept that you won\u2019t have any control over how people receive it. Just hope for the best, promote it like crazy and then move on. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in trying to make the best-seller list, but it\u2019s like ... writing a book is the achievement. It\u2019s super hard to do and the fact that in the span of three years, I\u2019ve written two books, I\u2019m like, \u201cYaaaaas Gaga.\u201d The book tour will be exhausting, but I could be a doctor having to deliver bad news, but I\u2019m not. So I try to have perspective and take vitamins like biotin so my Afro will be poppin\u2019.\n\n8 p.m. Comedy set. I\u2019ve been doing comedy for 10 years. I think any time you go on stage, you\u2019re going to have a small part of you that is dreading sucking, but it\u2019s work. That\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s a job and you have to show and do the damn thing. No one in the audience cares about whatever is going on in my head because they paid to be entertained. And ultimately, I\u2019m going to do thousands and thousands of shows in my life. The preciousness of it has to go away.\n\nI don\u2019t run my stuff in a mirror. I just have an idea, a few lines I\u2019ve written down and sort of talk myself through it on stage and then keep refining it and figuring it out. The sausage is getting made very publicly, but it makes you fearless in a way.\n\nWednesday\n\n7 a.m. Hair and makeup before photo shoots for T: The New York Times Style Magazine and Apartment Therapy. Over all, these shoots are chill. I\u2019m friends with my hair and makeup people (Delina Medhin and Sabrina Rowe), so they make it a lot more enjoyable.\n\n9 a.m. I think I want all shoots to happen at my home now. It\u2019s nice to roll out of bed, walk around barefoot and drink a LaCroix and then shoot and then be like, \u201cO.K., everyone leave.\u201d\n\n2 p.m. Post updates on socials about Black Girls Code. I got involved with this organization after I literally just Googled \u201cblack owned charities.\u201d", "In the statement announcing the deal, Mr. Jiaravanon promised to invest in technology and journalism at Fortune.\n\nLike all magazines, Fortune\u2019s print business has declined \u2014 ad pages for 2018 are down more than 25 percent \u2014 which prompted the title to focus on other potential areas of growth, specifically digital advertising and conferences. Those businesses now make up about 62 percent of Fortune\u2019s nearly $100 million in annual revenue, and the magazine makes about $10 million in profit when not taking into account interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n\nThe purchase price and Mr. Jiaravanon\u2019s willingness to invest in the magazine were key factors in his winning bid, Mr. Murray said, although the specific amount of additional investment was not discussed. The magazine is likely to add to its staff and will consider putting a paywall on its website.\n\nMeredith moved quickly after acquiring Time Inc. last year to sell the magazines that did not fit into its existing stable: glossies centered around home and lifestyle and geared toward female readers. The company announced in March that it was seeking a buyer for Fortune, as well as for Time, Money and Sports Illustrated. Although Meredith\u2019s decision to sell those titles was widely expected, it nonetheless signaled a further decline of the magazine industry.\n\nAuctioning off the magazines was more complicated than Meredith executives had expected. As a case in point: Mr. Benioff was close to buying Fortune before switching his preference to Time when he saw that it was a bigger business. At that point, Meredith had to seek new bidders for Fortune.", "\u201cPeople don\u2019t use that word anymore,\u201d Penelope tells him, but her mild rebuke merely provokes him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a molecule of prejudice,\u201d he rails. \u201cI\u2019ve been in battle with every kind of man there is.

I believed it contained a recorder because I had been told as much, but I didn\u2019t know for sure because I had never actually opened it. How had I let this happen? I had been tasked with one job in the summer vacation after my first year at drama school \u2014 to learn to play the instrument for the school\u2019s tour of the Nativity play. I hadn\u2019t. And the term was starting in T minus 12 hours. All I could do now was pray.\n\nThen something amazing happened. God called me! Well not quite, but close enough. My agent. I had auditioned for a film early on in the summer holidays, had heard nothing for two months and had long since concluded that I had not been successful.

Or should photographers instead work with the flood of images already out there? Could photographs from the past help us understand who we are today?

But some of the biggest and best-known names that you might associate with the fund weren\u2019t among them.\n\nThe Vision Fund is capable of hugely influential transactions, such as the $15 billion-plus injection of additional capital into the office-sharing start-up WeWork that is currently under discussion, according to news reports. Despite the fund\u2019s financial firepower, though, holdings sometimes end up elsewhere in the SoftBank sprawl.\n\nA $5 billion investment in China\u2019s Didi, originally made by SoftBank, is now housed in another vehicle altogether, known as the Delta Fund. It has been separate from, but generally mentioned alongside, the Vision Fund since it was revealed in 2017.", "Facebook, home to more than two billion regular users, was the obvious target. Since Russian-backed trolls succeeded in a widespread influence campaign that reached millions of Americans in 2016, Facebook has been under pressure to safeguard its network against the threat of further foreign meddling.

And users generally trust private messaging services more than they do more public venues like Facebook.\n\nFacebook has also spent the past month dealing with fallout from a breach involving tens of millions of its users, a gargantuan lapse that came at the worst possible time.

And that era is on its way to extinction.\n\nTo pretend this is not so is to ignore everything we have learned over the last year about men and women and perception and the danger of received conventions.

I used them a month ago in Sweden for the first time in front of a live audience. Hmm, I thought, These feel weird. Not all they are cracked up to be. Very much like ear plugs, in fact.\n\nI felt like I was in a pantomime, or underwater, and finally I remembered there was a little dial poking up out of my pocket that I had access to. I decided to turn it up \u2014 thereby turning it on. I had performed half the show with the monitors turned off! Oops. No wonder I couldn\u2019t hear anything.\n\nThis is the world of technology. Although I am attracted to it, it\u2019s not something I have a real knack for. Not like my mother, for example. When she comes over and sits down at my computer, she says, \u201cWhy is your computer running so slowly? When was the last time you cleaned out your applications? Have you repaired your permissions lately?\u201d Other moms tell you to clean out your cupboards or your closets.\n\nMy mother is a computer systems analyst, just retired from the New York City transit system, where she was a troubleshooter. I remember one day in the \u201870s when, as a teenager, I wandered into the kitchen in search of food. My mother was at the table with a huge contraption next to her on the floor, something about the size of a small refrigerator, waist-high, with the receiver of our telephone cradled into it.\n\n\u201cI am accessing the Hunter College Library, isn\u2019t that neat?\u201d I thought it was, but wondered, when was dinner?\n\nSo never mind the bizarre rumors that persist about my mom being a jazz guitarist, which came from one journalist who asked if I was from a musical family. I told her my stepfather played the guitar, and my mother played jazz around the house. Meaning records. The journalist then invented this image of my mom as a jazz guitarist and published it far and wide, and unfortunately it has been set up as fact by many different Web sites. Thank goodness for Wikipedia. It doesn\u2019t bother my mother, though. She says, \u201cI\u2019ll take some lessons and have a comeback!\u201d\n\nMy daughter also seems to have a knack for technology. One rainy Saturday afternoon when she was 10, I asked what she was doing. \u201cDoing HTML for my friend\u2019s Web site! Graphics!\u201d she said cheerfully. Sometimes I will find her recreating Rihanna\u2019s \u201cUmbrella\u201d song, track by track, on Garageband when she\u2019s bored.\n\nWhereas I tend to get frustrated and do things like bang on the hard drive with my fist, which is how I destroyed all the data on my last computer.\n\nSo why, given all that, am I called the \u201cMother of the MP3\u201d?\n\nIn my last blog, I was discussing the idea of being a two-hit wonder, and wrote about the song \u201cLuka.\u201d The other hit AOL cited in its story (called \u201cTwo-Hit Wonders\u201d) was \u201cTom\u2019s Diner,\u201d which was a hit for me in 1990. This wasn\u2019t just a plain ordinary hit, if there is such a thing. To this day it is sticky with the modern issues of technology and copyright law.\n\nI got the idea for \u201cTom\u2019s Diner\u201d in 1981, but I wrote it in the spring of 1982, making the song 26 years old now. When I was at Barnard College in Manhattan, I used to go to Tom\u2019s Restaurant for coffee, and after I graduated I also ate there before going to work. It was then a cheap, greasy place on 112th and Broadway, and it still is, in spite of its celebrity. (Sorry, but I have never been to the one in Brooklyn, though I hear it\u2019s really cute. The real one isn\u2019t cute, and isn\u2019t atmospheric. It\u2019s just plain, which is why I liked it.) And yes, it is the same one they use in the Seinfeld credits \u2014 the neon sign that says \u201cRESTAURANT.\u201d I actually once saw Jerry Seinfeld right near there!\n\n\n\nI have a photographer friend, Brian Rose, who has taken pictures of the Lower East Side of Manhattan and the Berlin Wall. He told me once long ago that he felt as though he saw the world through a pane of glass. This struck me as romantic and alienated, and I wanted to write a song from this viewpoint.\n\nI had been taking classes at Barnard with titles like \u201cThe Dramatic Monologue.\u201d I was in Tom\u2019s and I thought it would be fun to write a song that was like a little film, where the main character sees all these things but can\u2019t respond to any of it unless it relates to him directly. The part about the actor dying was true \u2014 it was William Holden. Some fans recently looked up the day he died and named the next day Tom\u2019s Diner Day. (In addition, see here.) I made up the part about the woman who was fixing her stockings.\n\nThe part where I sing about the \u201cmidnight picnic\u201d is from an actual picnic I had with the songwriter Jack Hardy on the steps of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine one night.\n\nThe melody hit me as I was walking down Broadway, fast. I wanted something jaunty. I remember liking the near rhymes of \u201cdiner\u201d and \u201ccorner,\u201d \u201csitting\u201d and \u201cwaiting.\u201d Although it is actually Tom\u2019s restaurant I changed it to diner as it sings better that way.\n\nI was imagining it as a kind of French film soundtrack, something vaudevillian on piano, like a background to a Truffaut film. But I didn\u2019t play piano and didn\u2019t know anybody who did. So I kept it a cappella, and began to sing it this way in my live show. This detail, singing the song alone with no accompaniment, affected everything to come.\n\nI noticed right away, at my shows, that whenever I opened my mouth and sang, \u201cI am sitting, in the morning\u2026\u201d, people would stop drinking and talking, and immediately whirl around and stare at the stage. So I used it as an opening song. I can\u2019t think of a single time that this didn\u2019t work. Even at the Prince\u2019s Trust concert in 1986, in front of 10,000 people, I went onstage as the opening act and began the entire concert with that song \u2014 and it worked!\n\nIt was a short step to recording it that way and opening my second album with it, since it was such a successful song live.\n\nFor the album we created a reprise, which I hoped sounded sort of Brechtian.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the single \u201cLuka\u201d was on the same album, \u201cSolitude Standing,\u201d which ended up selling three million copies around the world. So it was a widely available album that led off with an a cappella song. I had heard some people used it to test their speakers \u2014 not just that song, but the whole album, because of the sonic quality. (I know for sure that Philip Glass used it at his sound checks and Karl-Heinz Brandenberg told me he knew people used it to test their speakers\u2026)\n\nA few years later, in 1990, I was on tour promoting \u201cDays of Open Hand,\u201d our follow-up. It wasn\u2019t going that well, to put it bluntly. We had devoted a year to creating the album, spent a lot of money, thought and rethought every note and syllable. But the reviews were mixed. In the end, it sold \u201conly\u201d a million, which these days would of course be considered a miracle.\n\nWe were backstage at the Arsenio Hall show when my manager told me that some boys calling themselves DNA, in England \u2014 Bath, to be specific \u2014 had taken \u201cTom\u2019s Diner\u201d and put a dance track to it. They had \u201cre-mixed\u201d it. (I don\u2019t remember what we called that type of music back then \u2014 house? rap? hip-hop? It wasn\u2019t \u201cdisco\u201d or \u201cthrash-metal.\u201d) My manager, Ron Fierstein, told me that A&M and Polygram were considering taking legal action against them for copyright violation.\n\nI thought, well, let me listen to it \u2014 and immediately liked it. It made me laugh. It wasn\u2019t a parody, which is what I was afraid of. The song is the same, my voice is still my voice, the story still the story, even though they left out the very end (they told me later they thought it sounded weird, musically, to keep the ending).\n\nAfter \u201cLuka\u201d there had been an onslaught of parodies that I hated, but there was one cover I really liked \u2014 the Lemonheads version, which we called \u201cthrash\u201d for some reason; now it would be considered \u201calternative.\u201d I thought it was really cool and felt it expanded our audience. I put this version of \u201cTom\u2019s Diner\u201d in that category of cover song.\n\nApparently DNA had made vinyl copies of their creation in plain white covers labeled \u201cOh Susanne!\u201d Their story was: they had tried to ask permission from the record company but no one returned their phone call \u2014 which I believe. They didn\u2019t want to wait. They decided to sell them at their local corner record shop. It sold a lot right away. That\u2019s when the record company found out about it.\n\nIt was so obvious that these boys were not slick hi-fi wizards, as the sound was boomy and the arrangement repetitive, but the raw energy of the idea jumped out right away. These were not boys with means and money, and I liked it that I had kindled their imagination.\n\nWe decided to arrange a meeting. I was backstage and someone said, \u201cThe DNA boys are here!\u201d I looked up . . . and saw the manager and the accountant.\n\n\u201cBring them in!\u201d I said. Because of the sound of the remix, I had assumed DNA were black, and so I looked over the heads of these two white men, trying to see whoever was behind them.\n\n\u201cThese are DNA!\u201d said my manager.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d I said, confused. Nick Batt, the artistic one, said hi, looking shy and skinny (the \u201caccountant\u201d). Neal Slateford was more cocky and blustery (the \u201cmanager\u201d).\n\nInstead of sending the boys to jail, my manager worked out a deal with them for a flat fee. A&M Records paid the fee, and we retained all rights.\n\nI made the decision to call the remix \u201cTom\u2019s Diner, by DNA featuring Suzanne Vega\u201d because I didn\u2019t know if the audience would accept the new sound, and I wanted to make it clear that it wasn\u2019t my production. To my surprise, I didn\u2019t have to worry about that as it was accepted everywhere. DNA were surprised to find themselves suddenly classified as an \u201cact,\u201d since they did mostly production.\n\nI had imagined that a few dance clubs would play it, and that would be the end of it. But it was played on radio right away, including the R&B stations, a new experience for me. I even received a plaque congratulating me for having one of the most played R&B songs of 1990. R&B! How cool.\n\nIf there was a downside, it was that nothing was helping the sales and the reception of my new album, \u201cDays of Open Hand.\u201d It was crazy to release something from three years before, from a different project entirely.(In fact, one girl wrote to me complaining that she bought the original a cappella one by mistake and wanted her money back. She wanted to know: where was the music? And implied that somehow it had come apart from the vocal in the shipping process.) Confusing for everybody.. However, the public demanded it! So I learned that hard work and long hours does not guarantee success. Raw energy and great ideas spark the public interest better than attention to \u201cquality.\u201d\n\nIt was astonishing to me to hear that the kids at Joan of Arc Junior High on West 93rd Street were dancing in the street to it one day, since as a kid growing up on the Upper West Side, I was ostracized in some of my classes for being \u201cwhite.\u201d In African Dance class in 1972, I was smacked in the back of the head for being there at all. (I was raised in a half-Puerto-Rican family, as half-Puerto Rican. I found out at the age of nine or so that I actually had a different father from my brothers and sister \u2014 my birth father was English-Scottish-Irish from California.)\n\nSuddenly, with the remix of \u201cTom\u2019s Diner,\u201d that world that I had grown up in and struggled with had accepted me and my music in a way I couldn\u2019t have predicted and couldn\u2019t control.\n\nOther versions came flooding in from all over the world. People made them up and mailed me cassettes. I loved one by Michigan & Smiley, a kind of reggae improvisation. And Nikki D, a young black woman from Los Angeles with a gold tooth, changed it into a song about teenage pregnancy \u2014 that was another one of my favorites.\n\nWhat was I going to do with all these \u201cTom\u2019s Diner\u201d songs? They were going to waste filling up boxes in my apartment. So, along with an engineer, Denny McNerney, I gathered all the songs together into a collection called \u201cTom\u2019s Album,\u201d using some cartoons that an artist called Tom Hart had given me when he heard the song originally. I wrote some liner notes and approached A&M about releasing it.\n\nWhy would you put out 11 versions of the same song?, they wondered. One reason was that I had hired DNA to do a remix of another song \u2014 one called \u201cRusted Pipe,\u201d from \u201cDays of Open Hand.\u201d I was still looking for a way to channel all of that enthusiasm into selling the new project (and I wanted to include it on \u201cTom\u2019s Album\u201d). That didn\u2019t work so well. But 15 years later, \u201cTom\u2019s Album\u201d continues to sell. People think it is a bootleg and sidle up to me whispering, \u201cHave you seen this? Someone put this together.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. That someone was me.\u201d\n\nHowever, it was a logistical nightmare to administrate. I had to go back to all the people who had taken the song without permission, and ask their permission . . . to use their version of my song! This is the main reason we have not put out \u201cTom\u2019s Albums\u201d 2 and 3, which we certainly could, as now we are up to almost 30 remixes including (really good) ones from Danger Mouse and Tupac.\n\nThere a few new remixes or interpolations every year. Some ask first, and some don\u2019t. The last one to ask permission was the artist Pink, who I love. I feel I have a liberal remix and usage policy \u2014 I have said yes to almost every request regarding \u201cTom\u2019s Diner\u201d \u2014 except one, for pornography. The most extreme one is probably \u201cCame in the Door Pimpin\u2019\u201d by Dave Hollister. I approved it because I felt it was his authentic point of view.\n\nI love the remixes, I embrace them, I am proud of many of them. Yes, they have \u201crevitalized and extended my career,\u201d as someone put it to me recently. They make me feel connected to the world beyond New York City in a way I never could have imagined when I wrote the original song about a single person feeling isolated. Absolutely. However, I still believe in copyright protection. This issue alone could take up a blog by itself. Maybe for another day.\n\nThe DNA boys and I later worked together a few times, including on a song of mine called \u201cSalt Water\u201d that appeared on their 1992 album \u201cTaste This!\u201d. But it all started with \u201cTom\u2019s Diner,\u201d and I asked them once why they had remixed my song.\n\n\u201cWe were fans,\u201d said Neal. \u201cIt was obvious. The rhythm was already in the song. If we didn\u2019t do it, someone else would have.\u201d\n\nOne reason someone else would have done so is that it was so easy to lift the voice right off the record and place it in whatever context you wanted, because of the simplicity of the production. I could see how a good-quality recording of a single voice could be attractive to some one designing an MP3, for example.\n\nOne day in 2000, I dropped my daughter, Ruby, off at nursery school and was approached by one of the fathers I didn\u2019t know very well. Imagine my surprise when he said, \u201cCongratulations on being the mother of MP3!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d I said, wondering what he was talking about.\n\n\u201cThere is an article this week in a magazine called Business 2.0, calling you the \u2018mother of the MP3.\u2019 They used one of your songs to create it.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally. Well, thanks. I\u2019ll check it out.\u201d\n\nI ran home and found the article online.\n\nThe title was \u201cIch Bin Ein Paradigm Shifter: The MP3 Format is a Product of Suzanne Vega\u2019s Voice and This Man\u2019s Ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MP3 fools the ear by eliminating the least essential parts of a music file\u2026To create MP3 [Karl-Heinz] Brandenberg had to appreciate how the human ear perceives sound. A key assist in this effort came from Suzanne Vega. \u2018I was ready to fine-tune my compression algorithm,\u2019 Brandenberg recalls. \u201cSomewhere down the corridor a radio was playing \u201cTom\u2019s Diner.\u201d I was electrified. I knew it would be nearly impossible to compress this warm a cappella voice.\u201d\u2018\n\nSo Mr. Brandenberg gets a copy of the song, and puts it through the newly created MP3. But instead of the \u201cwarm human voice\u201d there are monstrous distortions, as though the Exorcist has somehow gotten into the system, shadowing every phrase. They spend months refining it, running \u201cTom\u2019s Diner through the system over and over again with modifications, until it comes through clearly. \u201cHe wound up listening to the song thousands of times,\u201d the article, written by Hilmar Schmundt, continued, \u201cand the result was a code that was heard around the world. When an MP3 player compresses music by anyone from Courtney Love to Kenny G, it is replicating the way that Brandenburg heard Suzanne Vega.\u201d\n\nSo goes the legend. The reason I know what that MP3 originally sounded like is that last year I was invited to the Fraunhofer Institute in Erlangen, Germany, where I met the team of engineers who worked on the project \u2014 including Mr. Brandenberg, who I had met once before at the launch of the Mobile Music Forum in Cannes in 2001.\n\nAll the men are obviously intelligent, but Karl-Heinz is a character. He stands out, because he looks like a mad scientist. His hair and tie always look as if they have been blown askew in a stiff wind, and he taps the tips of his fingers together constantly, smiling beatifically.\n\nThe day I visited \u2014 \u201cThe Mother of the MP3 comes to the home of the MP3!\u201d said the woman in charge of press (the slightly odd implication being that I would be meeting the various \u201cfathers\u201d of the MP3) \u2014 we had a press conference at which they played me the original version of \u201cTom\u2019s Diner,\u201d then the various distortions of the MP3 as it had been, which sounded monstrous and weird. Then, finally, the \u201cclean\u201d version of \u201cTom\u2019s Diner.\u201d\n\nThe panel beamed at me. \u201cSee?\u201d one man said. \u201cNow the MP3 recreates it perfectly. Exactly the same!\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, to my ears it sounds like there is a little more high end in the MP3 version? The MP3 doesn\u2019t sound as warm as the original, maybe a tiny bit of bottom end is lost?\u201d I suggested.\n\nThe man looked shocked. \u201cNo, Miss Vega, it is exactly the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that an MP3 compresses the sound and therefore loses some of the warmth,\u201d I persisted. \u201cThat\u2019s why some people collect vinyl\u2026\u201d I suddenly caught myself, realizing who I was speaking to in front of a roomful of German media.\n\n(Actually, I recently read an article that said the high end is distorted and the low end uncompromised, so I guess there is room for subjectivity in this argument.)\n\n\u201cNo, Miss Vega. Consider the Black Box theory!\u201d\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\u201cThe Black Box theory states that what goes into the Black Box remains unchanged! Whatever goes in comes out the same way! Nothing is left behind and nothing is added!\u201d\n\nI decided it was wiser at this point to back down.\n\n\u201cI see. O.K. I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d\n\nThey were happy again. Then they showed me a seven-point sensurround system, their latest project. But as I was a kid who grew up with transistor radios and lousy record players that were left at our house after our parents\u2019 parties, I kind of like a hard, tinny sound. The lo-fi approach works for me. Still, I appreciated their enthusiasm. It was a great day and I was very proud to have been a tiny part of history.\n\nSo, that\u2019s my long and winding history of a little postcard from the Upper West Side of Manhattan!\n\nThanks for reading this and thanks so much for your wonderful comments about \u201cLuka.\u201d I read them and re-read them, and soon I will write some future blogs like, Is it demeaning to work in an office or have a day job? (Answer: no!) What if you work in an office and it is your heart\u2019s desire to do something else? (Still no.) If I wrote a song about child abuse, and you thought it was about spousal abuse, did you get the song \u201cwrong\u201d? (Answer: No. Absolutely not!)\n\nI was shocked by all the apologies! Can you ever get a song \u201cwrong\u201d?\n\nWell, yes. I wrote a song called \u201cUndertow\u201d that my sister wanted played at her wedding. My brother said it was inappropriate, since he thought it was about oral sex. But that was not what it was about at all.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you about it some other time.\n\nSuzanne Vega, a singer and songwriter whose success in the 1980s helped establish the acoustic folk-pop movement, has released eight albums, including the platinum-selling \u201cSolitude Standing\u201d (1987) with the hit single \u201cLuka\u201d and the 2007 recording \u201cBeauty and Crime\u201d on Blue Note Records. She is also the author of a book of poetry and was a host of the public radio series \u201cAmerican Mavericks.\u201d Her Web site is suzannevega.com.", "Smaller cities don\u2019t have all of these problems, but they do have many. I\u2019d add one issue to these lists, which bedevils both rural America and smaller cities: educational opportunity. In a mini-essay about Ohio on Twitter yesterday, Alec MacGillis of ProPublica pointed out that the state\u2019s investment in education has actually declined over the past decade.\n\n\u201cOhio,\u201d MacGillis writes, \u201chas an astonishing array of these small cities and towns \u2014 all with handsome old courthouses, coherent downtowns and grand Victorians, and almost all of them in a condition that breaks your heart. And that\u2019s not to mention the truly desperate rural areas of southern [and southeast] Ohio.\u201d\n\nIt is possible for Democrats to do better in places like Dayton and in rural areas. On Tuesday night, they got to see a model \u2014 in Ohio. Senator Sherrod Brown won re-election with a populist, jobs-focused message that focuses on economic class, not cultural issues. He won Montgomery County by more than 11 percentage points. In Minnesota, Senator Amy Klobuchar, also a Democrat, won re-election by a landslide. In Iowa, Wisconsin and parts of the West, Democrats also figured out how to hold down their rural losses.\n\nLabor unions played a role in many of these wins, as Slate\u2019s Jamelle Bouie notes. \u201cMidwestern campaigns capitalized on still-existing labor infrastructure to mobilize union members and bring them back into the Democratic fold,\u201d he writes.\n\nI understand why talk of rural America often frustrates progressives: Rural America \u2014 which is, of course, overwhelmingly white \u2014 already has outsize political power in this country, thanks to the Senate, the Electoral College and the privileged role that Iowa and New Hampshire play in presidential elections. But life in rural areas and small cities hasn\u2019t exactly been easy in recent years. In virtually every measurable way \u2014 incomes, wealth, education, health, longevity \u2014 large metropolitan areas have done better.\n\nDemocrats should, by all means, continue fighting for the issues that matter to metropolitan America, like civil rights. But there is a clear moral case for devoting more attention to small-town America at the same time. There is also a self-interested political case for Democrats.\n\nRelated: Doing better outside of major metropolitan areas would also help the party win more seats in state legislatures \u2014 which, as Bryce Covert notes in The Times, is where a lot of policy gets made. Her list includes the minimum wage, paid leave, clean energy, voting rights, criminal justice, gun safety and education.\n\nYou can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

Tremendously. China would have superseded us in two years as an economic power; now, they\u2019re not even close.\n\nThis is exaggerated.\n\nIt\u2019s true that China\u2019s growth is slowing. The economy expanded 6.5 percent in the three months that ended in September, the slowest pace in almost a decade. (Those are the official numbers, at least. Many economists believe Beijing\u2019s statistics are implausibly smooth and do not square with outside estimates.)\n\nBut even if China\u2019s growth rate hadn\u2019t slowed, the country was hardly about to eclipse the United States in two years. Last year, Chinese economic output totaled $12.2 trillion, according to the World Bank. The American economy\u2019s output totaled $19.4 trillion. Assuming the two economies kept growing at last year\u2019s rates, it would still take around a decade for China to surpass the United States.\n\nWhat Trump said\n\nChina got rid of their \u201cChina \u201925\u201d because I found it very insulting. I said that to them. I said, \u201cChina \u201925\u201d is very insulting, because \u201cChina \u201925\u201d means, in 2025, they\u2019re going to take over, economically, the world.

The Trump administration has repeatedly held up the plan as evidence that China unfairly privileges its own companies over foreign competitors in the Chinese market. The administration says its tariffs against China are intended in part to compel Beijing to change these practices.\n\nPerhaps in response to all the attention the plan has received, Chinese officials have lately stopped mentioning Made in China 2025 by name. News outlets have been ordered to keep it out of their stories.", "As thousands of Honduran migrants seeking asylum in the United States trek northward through Mexico, President Trump has pledged to stop them at the border by militarizing it with armed federal troops, under the guise of protecting Americans from \u201ccriminals\u201d and an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\nWhat he fails to recognize is that cruelty won\u2019t solve the current refugee crisis. Neither will buddying up with authoritarian leaders in Central America. Instead, those two strategies only deepen the crisis, because criminality and misrule are exactly what the caravan is fleeing.\n\nWhat Mr. Trump calls an invasion is actually the visible face of a deadly crisis of governance and violence in almost all of Central America \u2014 a retreat from the rule of law in favor of rule by corruption and criminality abetted by officials with impunity.\n\nFor example, Mr. Trump supports President Jimmy Morales, his authoritarian counterpart in Guatemala.

The targets then were Irish and German.\n\nThose dark forces morphed into the Ku Klux Klan, America\u2019s original and most durable domestic terrorists, who waged a post-Civil War campaign of murder and intimidation.

The acting chief has disparaged the special counsel investigation of Russian election interference, which he now oversees.\n\n\u2022 Business ties: Mr. Whitaker served on the board of a company that used his position as a former federal prosecutor to threaten consumers who tried to get their money back.", "In a stunning move on the heels of the midterm election, President Trump has forced the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and appointed an outspoken critic of the Mueller investigation \u2014 Matthew Whitaker \u2014 as acting attorney general, shunting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to the sidelines. This raises the specter of a fearful president attempting to muzzle Special Counsel Robert Mueller or hinder him from revealing whether his 18-month-long grand jury investigation has turned up evidence of criminality implicating Donald Trump or his immediate family.\n\nBut a 44-year-old \u201croad map\u201d from the Watergate prosecution shows a potential route for Mr. Mueller to send incriminating evidence directly to Congress. The road map was devised in 1974 by the Watergate special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, with our assistance. We wrote the road map \u2014 actually a report \u2014 to be conveyed to Congress; it was called \u201cReport and Recommendation\u201d and served as a guide to a collection of grand jury evidence contained in a single document. That evidence included still-secret presidential tape recordings that had been acquired through grand jury subpoena \u2014 but which had been withheld from Congress by President Nixon.\n\nThe recent decision by Washington\u2019s Federal District Court chief judge, Beryl Howell, to release the document from the National Archives provides a historic legal precedent that could be a vehicle for Mr. Mueller and the grand jury assisting him to share the fruits of their investigation into possible criminal conduct within the Trump presidential campaign and subsequent administration.\n\nIn all the discussion about Mr. Mueller\u2019s options when he concludes his investigation, little attention has been paid to the potential role of the grand jury. Chief Judge Howell\u2019s decision unsealing the Watergate road map brings new focus on the role the grand jury might play in the dynamics of the endgame. Although the grand jury is a powerful tool for federal prosecutors, it has historic and independent power and operates under the supervision of the federal judiciary. Following the Oct. 20, 1973, \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d \u2014 in which President Nixon forced the Justice Department to fire the original special prosecutor, Archibald Cox \u2014 the Watergate grand jury played a critical role in forcing the president to back down, hand over the subpoenaed tapes and appoint a new special prosecutor.", "Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night\u2019s highlights that lets you sleep \u2014 and lets us get paid to watch comedy.

The story of his current fame begins in 2011, when he published a book of notable ambition: to survey the whole of human existence. \u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,\u201d first released in Hebrew, did not break new ground in terms of historical research. Nor did its premise \u2014 that humans are animals and our dominance is an accident \u2014 seem a likely commercial hit. But the casual tone and smooth way Mr. Harari tied together existing knowledge across fields made it a deeply pleasing read, even as the tome ended on the notion that the process of human evolution might be over. Translated into English in 2014, the book went on to sell more than eight million copies and made Mr. Harari a celebrity intellectual.\n\nHe followed up with \u201cHomo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow,\u201d which outlined his vision of what comes after human evolution. In it, he describes Dataism, a new faith based around the power of algorithms. Mr. Harari\u2019s future is one in which big data is worshiped, artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, and some humans develop Godlike abilities.\n\nNow, he has written a book about the present and how it could lead to that future: \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century.\u201d It is meant to be read as a series of warnings. His recent TED Talk was called \u201cWhy fascism is so tempting \u2014 and how your data could power it.\u201d\n\nHis prophecies might have made him a Cassandra in Silicon Valley, or at the very least an unwelcome presence. Instead, he has had to reconcile himself to the locals\u2019 strange delight. \u201cIf you make people start thinking far more deeply and seriously about these issues,\u201d he told me, sounding weary, \u201csome of the things they will think about might not be what you want them to think about.\u201d\n\n\u2018Brave New World\u2019 as Aspirational Reading\n\nMr. Harari agreed to let me tag along for a few days on his travels through the Valley, and one afternoon in September, I waited for him outside X\u2019s offices, in Mountain View, while he spoke to the Alphabet employees inside. After a while, he emerged: a shy, thin, bespectacled man with a dusting of dark hair. Mr. Harari has a sort of owlish demeanor, in that he looks wise and also does not move his body very much, even while glancing to the side. His face is not particularly expressive, with the exception of one rogue eyebrow. When you catch his eye, there is a wary look \u2014 like he wants to know if you, too, understand exactly how bad the world is about to get.\n\nAt the Alphabet talk, Mr. Harari had been accompanied by his publisher. They said that the younger employees had expressed concern about whether their work was contributing to a less free society, while the executives generally thought their impact was positive.\n\nSome workers had tried to predict how well humans would adapt to large technological change based on how they have responded to small shifts, like a new version of Gmail.

Under pressure, some developers are scrapping their original plans and switching out ultraexpensive units for smaller, less pricey versions. At the same time, neighborhoods where condos were once scarce, like Bushwick in Brooklyn and Rockaway Park in Queens, are now seeing projects with below-average prices.\n\nWhat that means is that many snazzy new market-rate condos can now be had for less than $1 million, although that seven-figure cutoff might seem like an only-in-New-York definition of a deal.", "Hundreds if not thousands of Fox employees may lose their jobs under the Disney merger. Disney managers, meanwhile, are bracing for the difficult job of smoothly integrating the Fox people who will remain \u2014 the \u201cferal foxes,\u201d as one Disney-associated producer put it. The Disney culture is almost militaristic in its respect for hierarchy and focus on its family-friendly mission.

There are new rules for auditions (no more hotel rooms) and zero-tolerance responses to offensive jokes on Twitter, as the director James Gunn discovered in July when Disney fired him from the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d series. New human resources chiefs have been hired or will soon be at CBS, Sony Pictures, Viacom, Pixar and Endeavor, which owns Hollywood\u2019s largest talent agency, W.M.E.\n\n\u201cIt used to be more difficult to secure protections for actresses who are not household names \u2014 for actresses with the least power,\u201d said Jamie Feldman, an entertainment lawyer whose clients range from A-listers (Viola Davis) to rising stars (Juno Temple). \u201cIf you pushed back on nudity, for example, there was often this cavalier tone about her needing to understand the price of entry. That has changed completely. People are very conscious about not wanting to be seen as disrespectful.\u201d\n\nCompanies are looking for protection, too. Multiple studios are working to include morality clauses in their talent contracts. Some unions prohibit such provisos, but where possible, Fox is considering language stipulating that it can fire anyone whose conduct \u201cresults in adverse publicity or notoriety or risks bringing the talent into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule.\u201d Spotted, a start-up that evaluates celebrity endorsement-deal risk, has lately been talking about \u201cdisgrace insurance,\u201d which is offered by multiple underwriters and was also the subject of a panel at the most-recent Producers Guild of America conference.\n\n\u201cBrands have become more leery of aligning themselves with actors because of #MeToo,\u201d said Janet Comenos, Spotted\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThat means potentially millions of dollars not flowing into the Hollywood ecosystem \u2014 the managers, the agents.\u201d\n\nIt is impossible to know, of course, whether such changes will end or even dramatically reduce the abuses of power that have made Hollywood the center of the #MeToo revolution. There is clearly a palpable difference in behavior. But will an out-of-control business culture that operated for decades be permanently transformed? It will take years to find out, and there is a growing disillusionment among some of those on the front lines.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, I still don\u2019t see a real willingness to do what it takes to change a troubled culture,\u201d Ms. Gulas said. \u201cIt takes investment, and it takes a lot of stamina to see it through.

Booster doses can make the flu vaccine more effective, but the benefit is limited to a few specific groups.\n\nChildren are one group that may benefit from receiving two doses of influenza vaccine during the same flu season. In a multistate study, boosting increased vaccine effectiveness by nearly twofold in children 6 months to 8 years of age. The benefit was greatest among infants receiving their first influenza vaccinations and was still evident in subsequent flu seasons. Other studies have yielded similar results.\n\nBecause of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that \u201cchildren 6 months through 8 years getting vaccinated for the first time, and those who have only previously gotten one dose of vaccine, should get two doses of vaccine this season.\u201d\n\nPandemic flu, a worldwide epidemic caused by genetic variations of the influenza virus, is another situation in which booster dosing may be worthwhile, since our immune systems are not primed to mount a response to the new virus. But vaccination strategies are complex and must be guided by governmental health agencies. Simply taking two doses of the currently available vaccine will not be protective.", "Driven by a deep faith rooted in Christianity, many have clung to a belief that everything would work out in the end, that Mr. Trump\u2019s heart would be touched and he would allow them into the United States to work.\n\nEven Ms. Alvarado subscribed to this hopeful philosophy.\n\n\u201cWell, I can\u2019t think the opposite way,\u201d she shrugged.\n\nWhile most migrants in the caravan are young men, the group also includes many families with young children who have now been traveling for four weeks.\n\nMs. Alvarado and her relatives left their home on the outskirts of Comayagua, a city in central Honduras, on Oct. 12.

When dinner came in the trenches, the men would argue over who should fetch rations. But Peter never argued because he knew he could usually charm the kitchen into a bit more for himself. One evening when dinner was called, Peter volunteered. After successfully talking his way to a little extra food at the kitchen, he headed back with soup for the others, only to find that a German shell had killed his whole squad.

As more airlines try to squeeze more passengers onto their planes \u2014 and then squeeze more money out of those passengers by charging for things that used to be free (like checked baggage and onboard snacks) \u2014 passengers are increasingly looking for, and willing to pay for, a better travel experience.\n\nTo answer that demand, many airlines are turning to a new class of service: premium economy. Around 20 airlines, most of which are based abroad, currently offer dedicated premium economy cabins on long-haul routes. More carriers are set to introduce them in the coming years. On airlines from American to Qantas, premium economy offers travelers bigger seats and improved amenities for a price that is somewhere between regular economy and business class.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide on what to expect (and what not to) if you decide to upgrade on your next flight:\n\nWhat exactly is premium economy and why am I am hearing so much about it now?\n\nPremium economy was first introduced by Eva Air and Virgin Atlantic in 1992 as a new travel option for long-haul passengers who wanted a bit of extra comfort.

Here he seeks to elevate the naval battles between the French and British to a central place in the history of the American Revolution. He succeeds, marvelously. He can relate in a word or two what others might take a chapter to expound. For example, his phrase \u201cWashington\u2019s tightly coiled response\u201d captures the tense tone of much of Washington\u2019s wartime correspondence.\n\nNor is Philbrick afraid to make sweeping assertions. He writes that \u201cthe bitter truth was that by the summer of 1781 the American Revolution had failed,\u201d in that it was a stalemate that many Americans no longer supported physically or financially. Victory would be secured, he continues, not by Americans but by French funds, guns, ships and soldiers. (Philbrick also does hurricanes well.)

Based on a decade of research, her book is measured and rigorously reasonable, taking pains not to stray too far in any ideological direction. Freitas, a lecturer on women\u2019s issues and a well-regarded Y.A. author, elucidates the role alcohol and partying play in assaults, but insists that young women must not be held responsible for the violence committed against them. She stresses that the cultural factors that enable sexual assault are pervasive beyond the campus walls, but is optimistic that institutions can implement policies to help their students navigate sex responsibly and safely.\n\nShe is most emphatic and prescriptive in her examination of \u201chook-up culture,\u201d the ritualized patterns of casual sex that are common among young people. Hook-up culture has long been a source of moral panic for adult observers of college life, and those who are weary of such condemnations might find Freitas a bit grating when she says that one cause of sexual assault on campuses may be the absence of emotional intimacy between college sexual partners. It\u2019s a claim that ignores both the statistics showing that a great deal of sexual violence occurs within romantic relationships, and the reality that a lot of thoroughly consensual sex happens between people who are not in love.\n\nThe book gets into the weeds with a detailed study of failed university responses to sexual assaults, and readers outside the academy might lose interest toward the end, which specifies the ways large universities can be slow-moving, traditional and behind the times. But Freitas is worth reading for her interviews with college students, whom she treats with an uncommon degree of dignity and respect.

His novel, like the work they have championed, rejects many of the prevailing conventions of contemporary fiction, most significantly in this case that of having a narrator who is, to put it baldly, confined to one body for the length of the narrative.\n\nImage\n\nThis Samuel Johnson, we soon come to understand, is dead, and his particular brand of purgatory is to have his consciousness shuttled helplessly into the body of the nearest living being at hand whenever the one he is inhabiting expires. The conceit isn\u2019t without precedent: In interviews, Riker has cited Robert Montgomery Bird\u2019s \u201cSheppard Lee, Written by Himself,\u201d a novel published in 1836 in which the main character migrates between bodies, learning lessons about pre-Civil War America. (A less highbrow recent example is the 2012 young adult novel \u201cEvery Day,\u201d by David Levithan.) But Riker brings a unique, cheerfully grotesque sensibility to his crack at this hallucinatory mini-genre, emphasizing the bleakest aspects of his premise as he roves through a swath of the past half-century of American life.", "Msimang\u2019s parents believed in an exceptional South Africa, one whose future would be free of injustice. Their daughter learns not to see the world this way. In Canada, a boy in her grade-school class calls her an African monkey, and a group of white girls with whom she became close abruptly exclude her. These moments reveal racism\u2019s \u201csharp little teeth\u201d; before long, she realizes she has been spoiled as a child, bred to believe that she and her sisters \u201cweren\u2019t just children \u2014 we were representatives of ideals.\u201d Living abroad, \u201cfar away for the sake of freedom,\u201d her family was \u201cno more special than anyone else.\u201d\n\nIf Canada taught Msimang the insidiousness of racism, Kenya exposed her to class politics. In a moving scene, she confronts a boy who steals her bike. After a mob \u2014 which she compares to the chorus of a Greek tragedy \u2014 brings the perpetrator to her feet, the boy issues a careless apology. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t mean it,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe stares at me with naked rage. He is sorry that I am rich and he is poor and he is not moved by my tears or my vulnerability.\u201d The incident becomes a funny story her family likes to tell. But it\u2019s also discomforting evidence of economic inequality, a subject her parents seem hardly to discuss. Reflecting on the boy\u2019s behavior, Msimang concedes that she could \u201cnever say that he made no apologies for himself or that he blamed me for being a certain kind of girl and occupying the world with a certain kind of obliviousness that was not acceptable.\u201d There is no room for the complicated truth in the narrative their world imposes on them: The boy is a thief and she his victim.\n\nAt Macalester College, in St. Paul, Msimang undergoes a political awakening. She joins a black women\u2019s poetry troupe that performs work by women. But the group\u2019s political inspirations \u2014 \u201cthe words that animate our conversations, and that push us to act in the real world\u201d \u2014 are men. She begins to see her parents \u201cnot as revolutionary heroes, but as slightly na\u00efve.\u201d Msimang\u2019s biting humor gives this section a glorious punch. There is a sense that the more she distances herself from her parents, the more her own voice can emerge.\n\nIn coming-of-age stories, the journey to self-discovery almost always involves leaving home. But for children for whom \u201chome\u201d means the family unit rather than a particular location, leaving is not necessarily marked by physical movement. Like most daughters of African parents (this reviewer included), Msimang was taught to be brave but never defiant, particularly when it comes to family. She eventually moves to South Africa \u2014 the object of her parents\u2019 dreams and life\u2019s work. She marries, becomes a mother and, eventually, a journalist. She, too, is invested in her country\u2019s future, but on her own terms. \u201cSouth Africa doesn\u2019t need heroes,\u201d she writes. \u201cShe needs the best type of friends \u2014 those who bear witness.\u201d", "ONCE AND FOREVER\n\nBy Kenji Miyazawa\n\nTranslated by John Bester\n\nIllustrated. 273 pp. New York Review Books. Paper, $15.95.\n\nAlthough the early-20th-century Japanese writer Kenji Miyazawa died in his 30s, he produced an impressive number of poems and stories. His work was admired by many, from scholars in his own country to the American poet Gary Snyder, whose translations introduced Miyazawa\u2019s verses to an English-speaking audience. Now, finally, we have been given a collection of Miyazawa\u2019s stories, the work of the British translator John Bester.\n\n\u201cOnce and Forever\u201d offers glimpses into a vanished, semi-mythic agrarian world. In \u201cNight of the Festival,\u201d a young boy encounters a \u201cwild man of the hills\u201d at the festival of a mountain god; when he offers a spontaneous act of kindness, the man repays him out of all proportion to his good deed. As in the poetic form he preferred, the tanka, Miyazawa also closely observes the shifting landscape. And so, in \u201cThe Bears of Nametoko,\u201d we are told that \u201con most days of the year, the mountain breathes in and breathes out cold mists and clouds. The peaks all around it, too, are like blackish green sea slugs or bald sea goblins.\u201d The sky in \u201cGorsch the Cellist\u201d is \u201cturning faintly silver where black clouds were scudding across it toward the north.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nMuch of the material in \u201cOnce and Forever\u201d fulfills a reader\u2019s expectations of fairy tales. Miyazawa\u2019s subject matter is at times gloomy (betrayal and death feature prominently) and often otherworldly. The central character in \u201cThe First Deer Dance\u201d finds himself suddenly able to understand animal language, while in \u201cMarch by Moonlight,\u201d electric poles spring to life, walking along the railroad tracks, as almost any child who\u2019s ever gazed at their anthropomorphic forms has suspected they might. Many of the stories deliver moral lessons, some with blunt humor: Two blustering, privileged young men are almost eaten alive in \u201cThe Restaurant of Many Orders\u201d \u2014 and the reader wishes they were. Other stories are rendered with such nuanced ambiguity that it\u2019s impossible to extract a moral. (In \u201cThe Fire Stone,\u201d a young rabbit receives a rare, precious stone as thanks for saving a bird\u2019s life, but the reasons it is later taken away remain multivalent and mysterious.)", "In \u201cA Memorial Tablet in Via Mazzini,\u201d Geo Josz, the sole survivor of Ferrara\u2019s Jewish roundup, unexpectedly returns from Buchenwald. But his fellow citizens (who have seized his family\u2019s properties) soon turn upon this Ancient Mariner, who haunts the Caff\u00e8 della Borsa, importuning the customers with tales of the way each member of his family was exterminated.\n\n\u201cHow forced and exaggerated, in short, how false, these stories of Geo\u2019s were. And then what a bore!\u201d say townspeople, eager to begin the promised \u201cnew era\u201d \u2014 an era, Bassani seems to suggest, that can only be constructed by opportunists with good reason to bury the past.\n\nGiorgio Bassani belongs to that extraordinary flowering of Italian Jewish writers, from Natalia Ginzburg to Primo Levi, who came of age under Fascism and thus grew up skeptical, allergic both to absolutism and pious rhetoric. Theirs was a strange twilit generation. Their parents, it might be said, were still riding what Bassani calls \u201cthe euphoria of civic equality\u201d following the Unification of Italy, when Jews, recently liberated from the ghettos, threw themselves into public life as statesmen, scientists, scholars, entrepreneurs and, with their country\u2019s entry into World War I, as soldiers. These were \u201cmodern\u201d Jews, like the father of Bassani\u2019s narrator, who belongs to a synagogue much as he belongs to the Merchants\u2019 Club and who, \u201cromantic, patriotic, politically na\u00efve,\u201d joined the Fascist Party on returning from the front in 1919.\n\nImage\n\nBut Bassani\u2019s narrator has grown up in darker days. Still hard-wired with bourgeois codes of academic and professional achievement, he nonetheless feels himself \u201cnailed by birth to a destiny of exclusion and resentment,\u201d paralyzed by a bitter sense of futility and inertia. While his father, listing the \u201cpatriotic merits\u201d of Italian Jewry, assures his family that the proposed racial laws will never pass, the son foresees a \u201cfuture of persecutions and massacres\u201d for Ferrara\u2019s Jews, herded \u201clike so many frightened beasts\u201d back into the ghetto, \u201cfrom which, when all was reckoned up, we had emerged only some 70 or 80 years ago.\u201d It\u2019s symptomatic of Bassani\u2019s historical pessimism that his two finest novellas end with their respective protagonists\u2019 suicide.\n\nIn \u201cThe Gold-Rimmed Spectacles,\u201d we follow the fortunes of Athos Fadigati, a gentle, kindly doctor whose homosexuality is tolerated until he embarks on a masochistic and highly public love affair with a vicious local youth. As Proust did, Bassani likens homosexuality to Jewishness, and Fadigati\u2019s tragic ostracization is played out in parallel with the growing isolation of the narrator\u2019s own family, of their expulsion from all the activities and institutions that had formed their daily life.\n\n\u201cThe Heron,\u201d Bassani\u2019s masterpiece, takes place on a single Sunday in the late 1940s, when Edgardo Limentani, a Jewish landowner who spent the war in Switzerland, goes shooting for birds in the Po delta. Over the course of the day, Limentani finds himself increasingly alienated from the new Italy he encounters. He is equally repelled by the Communist-inspired sharecroppers on his farm, who are demanding a fairer deal, by the former Blackshirt who owns the flourishing hotel-restaurant where he stops for lunch and by the restaurant\u2019s new clientele, Milanese industrialists out for a day\u2019s sport, who seem \u201ca different race, stronger, more full of life, more attractive, more likable!\u201d In a kind of anti-epiphany, Limentani realizes that it\u2019s money that confers their superhuman air of well-being. Compared with this new god of money, all the old allegiances \u2014 religion, family, land, Fascism, Communism \u2014 are of little importance. It\u2019s a new world in which he can find no refuge.", "Feeling responsible for other people\u2019s happiness makes it exhausting for Elisabeth to even communicate with her family. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever read a novel that captures the emotional labor of people-pleasing language quite so well. When Coco talks to Elisabeth about death, Elisabeth tries to brighten the mood with \u201clight words\u201d like \u201cjust a sec, a sandwich, abracadabra.\u201d There\u2019s a funny moment where Elisabeth notices that her husband, during drunken sex, speaks only in aaba rhyme schemes. Later he confesses to an affair, and she can\u2019t help internalizing the language he prefers, her shock and grief unfolding in an aaba scheme in her mind.\n\nEven as the book reaches its inevitable conclusion, Elisabeth talks to herself in painfully upbeat language, using phrases like whoops-a-daisy! as she approaches her own death. Droll and horrific and incredibly moving, the ending makes you feel the full weight of those \u201clight words.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nIn \u201cThe Bus on Thursday,\u201d a comedic horror novel by the Australian writer Shirley Barrett, the narrator is enraged by the burden of putting others at ease. From the moment Eleanor Mellett gets her first mammogram, she\u2019s criticized for not being \u201crelaxed enough.\u201d By the time she\u2019s gone through a mastectomy and joined a support group, she\u2019s crafting furious blog posts about the pressure to remain optimistic: \u201cIf they are nudging you toward the scrapbooking table, then it is basically code for, \u2018You will die soon, so quick! Throw some photos in an album as a keepsake for your loved ones. Make sure you are smiling in these photos and have lots of hair. Decorate with butterfly stickers and inspirational quotes about dancing like nobody\u2019s watching, etc.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe whole novel is written in what Eleanor calls \u201cfunny-angry\u201d blog posts, which might be why the jacket copy pitches the book as \u201c\u2018Bridget Jones\u2019 meets \u2018The Exorcist.\u2019\u201d But it\u2019s closer to a fun, campy Tim Burton movie. Hoping for a fresh start during recovery, Eleanor takes a job at a school in Talbingo, a remote Australian town with no cellphone reception (uh oh) where a beloved teacher has disappeared. Here, she encounters a friar who looks like a praying mantis, a vacuum cleaner salesman who\u2019s almost supernaturally attractive, a mysterious 1960s power station, a paranormal bus, and a severed hand that appears to have a life of its own. If that sounds surreal, well, so does the experience of having cancer.\n\nBarrett also works as a screenwriter and filmmaker, so it\u2019s no surprise that she\u2019s a masterly world-builder. As Talbingo becomes more and more vivid, Eleanor gets increasingly unhinged, to the point where she\u2019s actively testing the limits of our sympathy. One of the funniest moments finds her giving a graphic talk about death to children; one of the most unsettling ones involves a child, too, but it\u2019s probably best left unspoiled here. Throughout the book, you\u2019ll be forgiven for wondering if Eleanor is a survivor in the crazy-making world of cancer recovery \u2014 or if she\u2019s just crazy.\n\nThere are no definitive answers in the sure-to-be-polarizing ending, which might leave some puzzled about the larger points that Barrett is trying to make. When I first finished \u201cThe Bus on Thursday,\u201d I threw it down in frustration, only to pick it back up and reread the final pages. Now, I wonder if the lack of some profound ending is deliberate. \u201cThis is the problem with having cancer: Everyone expects you to have mysteriously acquired some kind of wisdom out of the experience, and if you haven\u2019t, then it\u2019s a personal failing,\u201d Eleanor writes early in the book. Maybe Barrett doesn\u2019t owe us any revelations beyond this one: Don\u2019t trust a cancer novel that can be wrapped up neatly with butterfly stickers and inspirational quotes.", "GONE SO LONG\n\nBy Andre Dubus III\n\n444 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95.\n\nIn Andre Dubus III\u2019s best-selling memoir, \u201cTownie,\u201d he describes his difficult childhood with a certain amount of complicated nostalgia. The first few years of his life were happy and bohemian. His parents were social and literary, his mother was beautiful, an excellent cook. It was only after his father ran off with one of his students, prompting a slow-motion divorce, that Dubus knew real hardship. His family (he has three siblings) began moving from one cheap rental to another in failing provincial towns where casual violence (between neighbors and among classmates) became a part of his everyday life. \u201cWhen I thought of the word man,\u201d he writes, \u201cI could only think of those who could defend themselves and those they loved.\u201d\n\nHis new book, \u201cGone So Long,\u201d is a fictional exploration of this dangerous idea. Daniel Ahearn grows up in a beach town north of Boston. An ugly boy, hooknosed, with narrow-set eyes, he is picked on by other kids (as Dubus was) and learns to deal with this problem by succumbing to sudden and violent overreactions. His only recognizable talent is his voice: He has big \u201cpipes.\u201d The second-best thing that ever happens to him is that he gets a job as the D.J. for a carnival ride. The best thing follows from that: He meets a beautiful young woman named Linda, they have a child together, they get married. But when he catches other guys looking at her and beats one of them up, she doesn\u2019t take his side. Later, when she threatens to leave him, he kills her with a kitchen knife in a fit of rage while their 3-year-old daughter looks on.\n\nAll of this happens more or less in the back story. The novel\u2019s action takes place 40 years later, after Daniel has done his time and is dying of prostate cancer. He wants to see his daughter, Susan, before he goes. The narrative shifts between his point of view and those of Susan (an adjunct professor at a college in Florida, working on a novel) and Lois, the grandmother who raised her and shielded her from any contact with her father.\n\nThe problem of Daniel\u2019s violent male temper is mirrored by the problem of Susan\u2019s beauty. Like her mother, she has spent her life coping with, defending herself from and sometimes relying on her ability to attract male attention, an \u201caccount\u201d she can draw on whenever she wants, but at the expense of normal, loving relationships.", "Who says stars\u2019 autobiographies don\u2019t sell?

Nearly everyone. A recent analysis by a Brookings Institution fellow found that \u201cefforts to reduce recidivism through intensive supervision are not working.\u201d Reducing the requirements and burdens of community supervision, so that people can more easily hold jobs, care for children and escape the stigma of criminality \u201cwould be a good first step toward breaking the vicious incarceration cycle,\u201d the report said.\n\nMany reformers rightly point out that an ankle bracelet is preferable to a prison cell. Yet I find it difficult to call this progress. As I see it, digital prisons are to mass incarceration what Jim Crow was to slavery.\n\nIf you asked slaves if they would rather live with their families and raise their own children, albeit subject to \u201cwhites only signs,\u201d legal discrimination and Jim Crow segregation, they\u2019d almost certainly say: I\u2019ll take Jim Crow. By the same token, if you ask prisoners whether they\u2019d rather live with their families and raise their children, albeit with nearly constant digital surveillance and monitoring, they\u2019d almost certainly say: I\u2019ll take the electronic monitor. I would too. But hopefully we can now see that Jim Crow was a less restrictive form of racial and social control, not a real alternative to racial caste systems. Similarly, if the goal is to end mass incarceration and mass criminalization, digital prisons are not an answer. They\u2019re just another way of posing the question.\n\nSome insist that e-carceration is \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d But where are we going with this? A growing number of scholars and activists predict that \u201ce-gentrification\u201d is where we\u2019re headed as entire communities become trapped in digital prisons that keep them locked out of neighborhoods where jobs and opportunity can be found.\n\nIf that scenario sounds far-fetched, keep in mind that mass incarceration itself was unimaginable just 40 years ago and that it was born partly out of well-intentioned reforms \u2014 chief among them mandatory sentencing laws that liberal proponents predicted would reduce racial disparities in sentencing. While those laws may have looked good on paper, they were passed within a political climate that was overwhelmingly hostile and punitive toward poor people and people of color, resulting in a prison-building boom, an increase in racial and class disparities in sentencing, and a quintupling of the incarcerated population.\n\nFortunately, a growing number of advocates are organizing to ensure that important reforms, such as ending cash bail, are not replaced with systems that view poor people and people of color as little more than commodities to be bought, sold, evaluated and managed for profit. In July, more than 100 civil rights, faith, labor, legal and data science groups released a shared statement of concerns regarding the use of pretrial risk assessment instruments; numerous bail reform groups, such as Chicago Community Bond Fund, actively oppose the expansion of e-carceration .\n\nIf our goal is not a better system of mass criminalization, but instead the creation of safe, caring, thriving communities, then we ought to be heavily investing in quality schools, job creation, drug treatment and mental health care in the least advantaged communities rather than pouring billions into their high-tech management and control. Fifty years ago, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. warned that \u201cwhen machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.\u201d We failed to heed his warning back then.

She credited her parents, a Michigan power couple who worked in state government, with instilling in her a desire to give back to others. She also cited two life-changing experiences as the motivating forces behind her pragmatic approach to policymaking: caring for her dying mother in the early 2000s while she was nursing her first child and being sexually assaulted in college.\n\nMs. Whitmer described the sexual assault in an emotional speech on the floor of the State Senate in 2013, when she opposed the so-called rape insurance bill, which banned insurance coverage for abortion in private health plans unless women purchased a separate rider. The bill passed over her objections, but she views it as an example of how her values inform her political decisions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to appreciate that these experiences are what compels me to just come in and fix problems,\u201d she said. \u201cIt eliminates my patience for anyone who wants to politicize an issue instead of just rolling up their sleeves and getting to work.\u201d\n\nRepublicans struggled to find a consistent line of attack against Ms. Whitmer.

The department started enforcing them during the Clinton administration, after a statute was enacted in 1994 allowing the attorney general to use court agreements to remedy systemic, unconstitutional behavior.\n\nThe agreements gained a higher profile as the Obama administration entered into 14 of them as part of its efforts to improve relationships between the police and their communities. They became even more prominent after the killings of black men at the hands of the police captured headlines and set off the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn March 2017, a month after he took office, Mr. Sessions ordered a review of the use of consent decrees to ensure that they \u201cadvance the safety and protection of the public.\u201d He said that the pacts should also ensure that the police are safe and respected and that they should not interfere with recruiting efforts by the local police.\n\nMr. Sessions, who has long championed local sheriffs and police officers, maintained that the agreements \u201creduce morale\u201d among police officers and lead to more violent crime. Academics and researchers have contested his assertions about the links between consent decrees and crime rates.\n\nUnder Mr. Sessions, the department also dropped Obama-era investigations into the police in Chicago and Louisiana.\n\nLast month, Mr. Sessions opposed a consent decree between the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois attorney general enacted after a Justice Department report unveiled in the final days of the Obama administration found rampant use of excessive force aimed at black and Latino people. Under Mr. Sessions, the Justice Department said the deal placed too many restrictions on Chicago\u2019s police superintendent.\n\n\u201cWhen Jeff Sessions intervened in the locally negotiated consent decree in Chicago, it belied the love of federalism that he professes and uses to justify this effort to effectively end the use of consent decrees,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division.", "\u4e24\u5e74\u591a\u4ee5\u524d\uff0c\u6211\u548c\u4e00\u7fa4\u540c\u597d\u4e00\u8d77\u505a\u4e86\u4e00\u672c\u4e66\u8bc4\u7c7b\u8bfb\u7269\uff0c\u540d\u5b57\u53eb\u300a\u6570\u5b57\u65f6\u4ee3\u9605\u8bfb\u62a5\u544a\u300b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u4e00\u7fa4\u5bf9\u9605\u8bfb\u6570\u5b57\u5a92\u4f53\u4e66\u7c4d\u90fd\u6709\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u8bfb\u7269\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u90fd\u662f\u6570\u5b57\u5a92\u4f53\u4e66\u7c4d\u7684\u4e66\u8bc4\u3002\n\n\u867d\u7136\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u4e0d\u613f\u610f\u7528\u201c\u6742\u5fd7\u201d\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b57\u6765\u5f62\u5bb9\u5b83\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u5b83\u548c\u4e00\u672c\u6742\u5fd7\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u50cf\u4e86\uff1a\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u6bcf\u4e24\u4e2a\u6708\u4e00\u671f\uff0c\u81f3\u4eca\u5df2\u7ecf\u505a\u4e86\u5341\u4e8c\u671f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u540c\u597d\u867d\u7136\u90fd\u662f\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u5177\u6709\u5168\u7403\u89c6\u91ce\uff1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u6563\u843d\u5728\u5168\u7403\u5404\u5730\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u6211\u81f3\u4eca\u672a\u66fe\u8c0b\u9762\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u672c\u8bfb\u7269\u4ee5PDF\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\u2014\u2014\u8fd9\u5728\u6211\u770b\u6765\uff0c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u520a\u7269\u201d\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5b83\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5f88\u5c0f\u2014\u2014\u8fd9\u5e74\u5934\u8bfb\u4e66\u7684\u4eba\u59d4\u5b9e\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u66f4\u4f55\u51b5\u8fd8\u53ea\u662f\u805a\u7126\u201c\u6570\u5b57\u5a92\u4f53\u201d\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u5206\u9886\u57df\uff1b\u8fd8\u662f\u4e66\u8bc4\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u53bb\u5e74\u5728\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u4e3a\u8fd9\u672c\u520a\u7269\u505a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aapp\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u767b\u9646\u82f9\u679c\u7684App Store\u3002\u4f46\u540e\u6765\u8fd9\u4e2aapp\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u51fa\u4e86\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u4e0d\u4e86\u4e86\u4e4b\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u9762\u8fc7\u5c0f\uff0c\u8fd8\u662fapp\u7684\u592d\u6298\uff0c\u5927\u6982\u90fd\u548c\u8fd9\u672c\u8bfb\u7269\u6ca1\u6709\u5546\u4e1a\u610f\u56fe\u6709\u5173\uff1b\u4e5f\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0a\u592a\u8fc7\u6563\u6f2b\u6709\u5173\uff08\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u800c\u8a00\u5e76\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4e5f\u90fd\u662f\u51fa\u4e8e\u5174\u8da3\u3001\u4e0d\u62ff\u7a3f\u916c\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u81f3\u5c11\u610f\u5473\u7740\uff1a\u4e2a\u4eba\u51fa\u7248\uff08\u6570\u5b57\uff09\u5728\u6267\u884c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0a\u5b8c\u5168\u662f\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5982\u679c\u8981\u60f3\u51fa\u7248\u4e00\u4e2a\u520a\u7269\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u518d\u4f9d\u8d56\u67d0\u4e2a\u51fa\u7248\u673a\u6784\u751a\u81f3\u67d0\u4e2a\u5a92\u4f53\u4e86\u3002", "GREEN Mr. McOnie certainly had them working frantically. During the musical numbers, which feel relentless, the ensemble comes off as a troupe of overstimulated mimes playing charades. But here\u2019s my question for you: Was there anything, aside from Kong\u2019s two or three expressions, you actually enjoyed?\n\nBRANTLEY Not really. I kept hoping a higher camp factor might kick in. When poor Ann is taken to Kong\u2019s lair, and makes quips about his housekeeping and bachelor ways, I longed for the reincarnation of Madeline Kahn, who made such blissful hay out of similar material in \u201cYoung Frankenstein.\u201d\n\nGREEN The camp here is all accidental. The Skull Island jungle looks like green spaghetti with phlegm balls. (The scenic and projection designer is Peter England.) But the oppressiveness of the music and the over-intensity of the staging never allow you to laugh at, and therefore enjoy, the ludicrousness of the story.\n\nBRANTLEY Agreed. By the way, if you look at accounts of the Australian incarnation of five years ago, which had a book by Craig Lucas, it featured several more characters, including a love interest for Ann. In this version, there are effectively three central human characters: the agency-seeking Ann; the chauvinist, bad-mogul Carl; and (oh, dear) his put-upon, slow-witted, golden-hearted assistant, Lumpy (Erik Lochtefeld).\n\nGREEN The bevy of previous authors discarded in the course of the musical\u2019s development dodged a bullet here. But Mr. Lochtefeld actually manages to give a sincere and human-scale performance, even if most of what he has to say is maudlin hogwash.\n\nBRANTLEY Yes, even the screams lacked eloquence. Fay Wray, the star of the original, is best remembered for her earsplitting howls of terror when she\u2019s in the big guy\u2019s clutches. But our intrepid Ann is incapable of screaming in fear. Instead, she roars, and that\u2019s what attracts her soul mate Kong to her.

In an email to customers, the company referenced a blog post that described how one person wanted to speak with Mr. Cooper about his invention idea. The post said that the person was intercepted by the company\u2019s \u201cintimidating security team, all ex-Israeli special ops and trained in Krav Maga, one of the most deadly of the martial arts.\u201d\n\nThe post added, \u201cThe World Patent Marketing Security Team are the kind of guys who are trained to knock out first and ask questions later.\u201d\n\nAnother customer, Brenda Wilcox, 49, a Trump supporter who lives in Broward County, Fla., said in an interview on Thursday that World Patent Marketing scammed $11,000 from her. She said the company had agreed to market, license and develop a bracelet she invented that would warn drivers if they left a baby in the back seat of their car.\n\nAnother customer, William Knecht of Texas, lost about $35,000 on a patent package, according to the complaint. \u201cThe entire time I worked with W.P.M.

Mueller III to check on the progress of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The visit was the first since President Trump installed a loyalist atop the department to take control of an inquiry that has been his obsession.\n\nThe new acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, will oversee the investigation as Mr. Mueller and his team make numerous critical decisions in the coming weeks: whether to indict more of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates, whether to subpoena the president to force him to sit for an interview and whether to request leniency before a judge when Michael T. Flynn, Paul Manafort and other former Trump aides are sentenced.\n\nMuch is still unknown about how active a role Mr. Whitaker will play in overseeing the special counsel\u2019s work. Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, has overseen it and sent a top aide, Ed O\u2019Callaghan, to Mr. Mueller\u2019s office every two weeks, according to a department official. But Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and choice of Mr. Whitaker, who has a history of loyalty to the White House and a record of critical statements about Mr. Mueller\u2019s work, created an uncertain future for an investigation that was thought to be somewhat protected from political influence.\n\nNew evidence emerged on Thursday that Mr. Whitaker has already decided the answer to the central question of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. In an interview last year, first reported by The Daily Beast, Mr. Whitaker flatly pronounced, \u201cThe truth is, there was no collusion with the Russians and the Trump campaign.\u201d", "Exactly how many Georgia votes remain to be counted is a topic of hot dispute. The Kemp campaign says that there are fewer than 25,000, not enough to change the outcome, but the Abrams side insists that the figures are almost certainly incomplete and that no one could yet know the precise figure.\n\nThe Abrams team has been blanketing the state\u2019s airwaves with ads exhorting voters who cast provisional ballots to do what is required to make sure they are counted. The state Democratic Party filed a lawsuit on Thursday hoping to extend a deadline for absentee ballots in a county affected by Hurricane Michael. Lawyers elsewhere are scrutinizing the methods some counties used to reject absentee ballots.\n\nAs prominent Republicans sent congratulations to Mr. Kemp on Thursday, Democrats did little to hide their disgust at his claim of victory, which they say is premature.

Its device resembles a flash drive, and has had a stunning appeal among youths ever since it was introduced.\n\nDr. Gottlieb focused on Juul and several other major e-cigarette makers in September, warning them to stop marketing to teenagers or risk being banned. He set a 60-day deadline for the major companies to prove they could keep their devices away from minors, and that timetable ends this weekend.\n\nAt the same time, the F.D.A. also warned 1,100 retailers to stop selling the devices to minors, and issues fines to some of them.\n\nThe latest actions follow months of meetings between the F.D.A. and e-cigarette makers over how to prevent teenagers from getting hooked on their products.\n\nJuul, which has more than 70 percent of the nation\u2019s e-cigarette market and has become ubiquitous in many high schools and middle schools, submitted thousands of pages of marketing documents and related materials. But the regulators, not satisfied, then visited the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters in September and seized more.\n\nThe four other products facing the 60-day deadline were RJR Vapor Co.\u2019s Vuse, Imperial Brands\u2019 blu and devices made by Logic. None of the companies responded to immediate requests for comment.\n\nRJR, Imperial and Altria are all major tobacco companies, which along with other industry heavyweights have viewed e-cigarettes as critical to their survival now that smoking rates have declined to their lowest levels in the United States.", "This is what it\u2019s come to \u2014 there are now Americans who have lived through two gun massacres. Many of the people who were able to flee a California bar where a man shot dozens of people late Wednesday night had also survived an attack last year in which a gunman in a Las Vegas hotel fired down on a music festival, killing 58 people. But at least one of the Las Vegas survivors was among the dead at the bar.\n\nThe gunman on Wednesday opened fire in a crowded country-music bar, a popular hangout for local college students. He shot a security guard first and killed at least 12 people, including a sheriff\u2019s deputy who responded to the attack. More than 20 were believed to have been wounded.\n\nThe carnage came just 11 days after the fatal shooting of 11 worshipers at synagogue in Pittsburgh, nine months after 17 people were gunned down at a high school in Parkland, Fla., one year after 26 were killed in a shooting spree at a church in Sutherland, Tex., and 13 months after the massacre in Las Vegas.\n\nAmericans are watching \u2014 and now some are even experiencing \u2014 versions of this same horror over and over, hoping that someone will eventually figure out how to break the cycle. Could that hero be President Trump and the House Democrats?", "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Disney returned to annual profit growth on Thursday after a difficult 2017, the result of blockbuster movies, rising theme park attendance and a stabilizing ESPN.\n\nDespite reporting a record profit of $12.6 billion for its fiscal year, the Walt Disney Company spent most of a call with analysts discussing its high-risk plan to introduce a Netflix-style subscription streaming service late next year, which will carry enormous content, technology and marketing expenses.\n\nRobert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, unveiled the name of the streaming service on Thursday, telling analysts on a conference call that it would be called Disney Plus, styled by the company as Disney+. The name parallels the one for Disney\u2019s fledgling sports streaming service, ESPN Plus.\n\nIn addition to the original shows and films already announced, Disney Plus will include a live-action \u201cStar Wars\u201d series based on the rebel spy Cassian Andor, a character from the 2016 film \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story.\u201d Diego Luna will reprise the role, Mr. Iger said.", "JAKARTA \u2014 The final moments of Lion Air Flight 610 as it hurtled soon after dawn from a calm Indonesian sky into the waters of the Java Sea would have been terrifying but swift.\n\nThe single-aisle Boeing aircraft, assembled in Washington State and delivered to Lion Air less than three months ago, appears to have plummeted nose-first into the water, its advanced jet engines racing the plane toward the waves at as much as 400 m.p.h. in less than a minute. The aircraft slammed into the sea with such force that some metal fittings aboard were reduced to powder, and the aircraft\u2019s flight data recorder tore loose from its armored box, propelled into the muddy seabed.\n\nAs American and Indonesian investigators puzzle through clues of what went wrong, they are focusing not on a single lapse but on a cascade of troubling issues that ended with the deaths of all 189 people on board.\n\nThat is nearly always the case in plane crashes, in which disaster can rarely be pinned on one factor. While investigators have not yet concluded what caused Flight 610 to plunge into the sea, they know that in the days before the crash the plane had experienced repeated problems in some of the same systems that could have led the aircraft to go into a nose dive.", "Similarly, for the last several decades American, welfare policy has focused on consumption \u2014 giving money to the poor so they can consume more. Yet we have not successfully helped poor people produce more so that they can take control of their own lives. We now spend more than $20,000 a year in means-tested government spending per person in poverty. And yet the average poverty rate for 2000 to 2015 was higher than it was for 1970 to 1985.\n\n\u201cWhat if people\u2019s ability to produce matters more than how much they can consume?\u201d Cass asks.\n\nThe bulk of his book is a series of ideas for how we can reform labor markets.\n\nFor example, Cass supports academic tracking. Right now, we have a one-size-fits-all education system. Everybody should go to college. The problem is that roughly one-fifth of our students fail to graduate high school in four years; roughly one-fifth take no further schooling after high school; roughly one-fifth drop out of college; roughly one-fifth get a job that doesn\u2019t require the degree they just earned; and roughly one-fifth actually navigate the path the system is built around \u2014 from school to career.\n\nWe build a broken system and then ask people to try to fit into the system instead of tailoring a system around people\u2019s actual needs.\n\nCass suggests that we instead do what nearly every other affluent nation does: Let students, starting in high school, decide whether they want to be on an apprenticeship track or an academic track. Vocational and technical schools are ubiquitous across the developed world, and yet that model is mostly rejected here.\n\nCass also supports worker co-ops. Today, we have an old, adversarial labor union model that is inappropriate for the gig economy and uninteresting to most private-sector workers. But co-ops, drawing on more successful models used in several European nations, could represent workers in negotiations, train and retrain workers as they moved from firm to firm and build a safety net for periods of unemployment. Shopping for a worker co-op would be more like buying a gym membership. Each co-op would be a community and service provider to address a range of each worker\u2019s needs.\n\nCass has many other proposals \u2014 wage subsidies, immigration reforms. But he\u2019s really trying to put work, and the dignity of work, at the center of our culture and concern. In the 1970s and 1980s, he points out, the Emmy Award-winning TV shows were about blue-collar families: \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d \u201cTaxi,\u201d \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d Now the Emmy-winning shows are mostly about white-collar adults working in Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, New York and Washington.", "But before the battle gets going, let\u2019s take a breath and ask: What do the results tell us about the country on a deeper level?\n\nA few things to look at:\n\n1. District Maps: This New York Times map shows which parts of the country shifted to the left and to the right compared to 2016. The leftward tilt was pretty widely dispersed.\n\n2. Exit Polls: Surveys of voters from the 1980s onward highlight divisions that are both racial and generational, with the age divide becoming especially striking.\n\n3. Diversity: More women and more young, nonwhite lawmakers are heading to Washington, including the first Muslim and Native American women elected to Congress. That means the power structure will more closely resemble the country at large.\n\nAll three of those developments point to an electorate with more people who have become more frustrated with President Trump, including many of those who voted for him two years ago.\n\nIf the age trends hold, and with a bunch of the winners coming from the more moderate side of the Democratic Party, it may also mean a future with more consensus than we have now.\n\nImagine that, an America united. I admit, I have a hard time picturing it.\n\nBut if we look beyond the what-ifs and issues and ideology \u2014 if we really step back \u2014 maybe we can see something more illuminating.", "Still, the move against Mr. Acosta, a frequent antagonist known for challenging the president during news conferences, was not entirely a surprise.\n\nAs a candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump barred journalists from Univision, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed News and Politico from attending his rallies. As president, he has popularized the phrases \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d and threatened to pull broadcast licenses and change libel laws to make it easier to sue.\n\nThe daily White House press briefing has slowly vanished. In July, a CNN reporter was barred from a Rose Garden event because White House aides said she had asked questions too aggressively.\n\nMr. Trump and his political team are no doubt aware that Mr. Acosta is a useful foil. \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d is a common chant at the president\u2019s rallies, and there is little political downside for the administration to restrict access to one of the network\u2019s star correspondents. The move is likely to rile Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents, buoy his supporters and have little or no effect on those occupying the nation\u2019s shrinking middle ground.\n\nAnd, as with most things Trump, nothing was cut-and-dried.\n\nThere was the timing: Mr. Acosta\u2019s credential was stripped hours after the president fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and had to explain away a difficult midterm election that handed his Democratic antagonists control of the House. Political strategists observed that a controversy over press rights, instigated by the White House, would make for a useful ploy to distract journalists and perhaps the public.\n\nThen there were the players: a showman president and an ambitious television correspondent in the spotlight.\n\nMr. Acosta sometimes elicits eye-rolls from others in the White House press corps, who wonder if his aggressive questions are meant less to draw out information from Mr. Trump than to create a camera-ready spectacle. \u201cMost of the people there were serious reporters asking serious questions,\u201d Chris Wallace, the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d moderator, said of Wednesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cBut Jim Acosta, I thought, embarrassed himself.\u201d", "Patrick Chappatte is an editorial cartoonist for The New York Times.
