President Trump's portrayal of a border under siege by drug smugglers and other criminals is at odds with what residents in towns along the 1,954-mile divide with Mexico see in their daily routines, with U.S. border towns consistently ranking among the safest in the country.\n\nU.S. military units in San Antonio and other locations in Texas, California, and Arizona are going through specific training and rules along the border, CBS San Antonio affiliate KENS reports. Joint Base San Antonio - Lackland Air Force Base is one of the primary locations where training is underway.\n\nSome Valley residents question the need for a large military presence and fear it will tarnish the area's image. And some are afraid of violence if and when the caravan of Central American migrants that the troops have been sent to confront reaches the U.S. border.\n\nWhile the southern tip of Texas is the busiest corridor for illegal crossings, border agents make many arrests far from public view, on uninhabited banks of the Rio Grande and on nearby dirt paths and roads lined by thick brush.\n\n\"I feel safer here than when I go up to bigger cities,\" lifelong Rio Grande Valley resident Emmanuel Torres said Friday while working at a coffee shop in Brownsville, the region's largest city, with about 200,000 people.\n\nEric Gay/AP\n\nTorres, 19, said the area feels \"a lot like family,\" and he worries the military presence will fuel outsiders' perceptions of a dysfunctional border.\n\n\"People that don't live here are just going to create a bigger negative image,\" Torres said.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump pledged this week to send up to 15,000 troops to the border in response to the slow-moving caravan of migrants, he unnerved the economically struggling region of 1 million people that stretches over flat, sun-drenched citrus groves and farms of cotton, sugar cane and vegetables.\n\nThe Pentagon said more than 3,500 troops have been deployed to staging bases along the border, including about 1,000 Marines in California. Still, there were only about 100 troops at the border on Friday, working at and near a bridge leading to McAllen, Texas, the Rio Grande Valley's second-biggest city, with about 140,000 people.\n\nMore than a dozen military members in fatigues were at the northern bank of the river, below the bridge, laying concertina wire. Other soldiers erected wire barriers on the bridge's pedestrian paths.\n\nThe largest caravan traveling through Mexico is still weeks away from the U.S. border, and migrants have given no indication where they might cross. The Rio Grande Valley is the shortest route from Central America but also one of the most dangerous.\n\nThe troops are being sent in what has been described as a support role, helping border agents. But Mr. Trump said he told the military that if troops face rock-throwing migrants, they should react as though the rocks were rifles.\n\n\"It's all preparation in anticipation of the caravan,\" said Manuel Padilla Jr., the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector chief. \"We're hoping that these people do not show up at the border. They're not going to be allowed in.\"\n\nConchita Padilla, a volunteer at the Brownsville Museum of Fine Art, said she believes the U.S. has the right to defend its borders. But she also said she is frightened by the troops because she doesn't know what they will do or how they will react to the caravan.\n\n\"My worry is that if they fight each other, there might be innocent people in the way that are suffering consequences,\" said Padilla, 66. \"We are just praying that they go in peace.\"\n\nAccording to an analysis by The Associated Press of FBI statistics, nine U.S. cities along the Mexican border had a violent crime rate of nearly 346 offenses per 100,000 residents in 2017. That's lower than the national rate of almost 383. In Brownsville, it was 257, in McAllen, 144.\n\nThose same nine border towns and cities also had a property crime rate of 2,058 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants. Nationwide, the estimated rate was just over 2,362 per 100,000.\n\n\"It's almost shocking, but it's true,\" Jack Levin, director of Northeastern University's Brudnick Center on Violence. \"The numbers don't lie.\"", "", "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a trial over the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census to go forward over the Trump administration's objection. The justices' issued a brief order Friday rejecting the administration's request to postpone the trial, set to begin Monday in New York.\n\nMore than a dozen states and big cities, among others, have sued over Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add a citizenship question to the census for the first time since 1950. The lawsuits argue that Ross acted improperly and that the question will discourage immigrants from participating, diluting political representation and federal dollars for states that tend to vote Democratic.\n\nThe administration has said the question will allow the Justice Department to enforce the Voting Rights Act more effectively.\n\nLast week, the justices blocked the questioning of Ross in advance of the trial, but allowed other preparations to continue.\n\nThe judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, said evidence suggests that Ross may have decided to add the question before asking the Justice Department to request it. He also cited proof Ross had overruled senior Census Bureau staff who concluded adding it was very costly and would harm the census count.\n\n\"Most significant, the Court found reason to believe that Secretary Ross had provided false explanations of his reasons for, and the genesis of, the citizenship question,\" Furman said.\n\nLast month, Ross, in a Justice Department filing, said he now remembers speaking with former senior White House adviser Steve Bannon last year about adding a citizenship question to the census. He also recalled discussing the matter with Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the spring of 2017 and at other times, Justice Department lawyers wrote in the filing.\n\nRoss had previously testified under oath that he was unaware of discussions between himself and anyone in the White House on the subject.\n\nJustices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's first Supreme Court pick, would have delayed the trial. The vote of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump's other nominee, was not clear from the order, but it would have taken the votes of two more justices to prevent the trial from taking place.", "PINELLAS PARK, Fla. \u2014 Severe storms tore through the Tampa Bay area Friday, including at least one tornado. Trees and wires went down, while roofs were ripped off homes.\n\nCellphone video captured the late afternoon tornado as it ripped through Seminole, Florida, about 24 miles west of Tampa. The line of heavy rain and wind uprooted trees, knocked down power lines and caused major damage to several homes and businesses.\n\n\"There are no injuries everyone is safe we have cleared all of the buildings that have damage,\" siad Seminole Fire Chief William Morelli.\n\nFor several hours, at least five counties were under a tornado warning. After the storm, road crews started clearing streets blocked by fallen trees. Some neighbors were shocked by the damage. Chuck DiMarco said he was at the supermarket during the storm, and received a panic call from his wife.\n\n\"She said 'Come home now, tornado.' That's all she said,\" DiMarco said.\n\nOnce he got home, he said he wasn't sure what he would see.\n\n\"I was walking that way toward my house and I was praying that I would find my house so we were spared,\" DiMarco said.\n\nNearly 60,000 people were without power Friday. The good news is the National Weather Service has given this area the all clear for any other possible storms.", "Ten years after Wall Street banks sparked a financial crisis that nearly wiped out the U.S. economy, the idea of nationalizing banks briefly came into vogue. Now, one city is on the verge of making a public bank a reality.\n\nLos Angeles on Tuesday will vote on whether to amend the city charter to allow it to own a financial institution. The ballot initiative, called Proposition B, marks the first time the issue of a public bank will come up for a popular vote.\n\nBut the concept has been gaining some ground. Washington state passed a bill this summer to create a public bank. New Jersey Democratic Governor Phil Murphy made the issue part of his campaign. San Francisco and Oakland are doing feasibility studies. And the Territorial Bank of American Samoa, which is backed by the government, began functioning this past April when it was approved to access the U.S. payments system.\n\n\"The purpose of all this is to bring democracy to finance, in a way that respects the public trust. No longer, at least in Los Angeles, do we think city borrowing should be the basis for the investment industry,\" said David Jette, legislative director for Public Bank LA, a volunteer effort backing Proposition B. PBLA was among the activist groups that succeeded in making Los Angeles pull city money out of Wells Fargo after its bogus-accounts scandal and subsequent public shaming.\n\nThere's even hope that a state-chartered bank could service the state's burgeoning cannabis industry. While a bill specifically aimed at boosting banking options for recreational marijuana industries failed to pass in the current legislative session, any such legislation would require the existence of an institution like the Los Angeles public bank in order to work.\n\nMoney-saver or unfair competition?\n\nThe idea is simple: Instead of paying for a private institution to hold the city's money, the city would own the institution -- saving on fees and reinvesting the profits into public works. While activists support the plan as a money-saver, the banking industry opposes the measure, saying it would create unfair competition.\n\nLos Angeles currently spends upward of $1 billion a year on finance fees, a figure that could be reduced substantially, advocates said. Proponents also said a public bank could underwrite city bonds at a cheaper rate than Wall Street institutions offer.\n\n\"You improve the efficiencies, because you don't have Wall Street holding on to billions of dollars in customer deposits, taxpayer deposits, and then lending it back to you when you need to put out municipal bonds,\" said Marc Armstrong, a co-founder of the Public Banking Institute, which studies the issue.\n\nProponents also hope a state-owned bank will make loans that a private institution might find insufficiently profitable, such as funding public projects and investing in housing and clean energy efforts. It could create access to banks for the 20 percent of Los Angeles households whose neighborhoods offer no traditional consumer-banking services, according to an analysis from the city's legislative analyst.\n\nAnother potential benefit: Because such a bank engages in the conservative business of holding deposits and lending out money, it will be less likely to overextend itself, collapse and tank the economy in the manner of Wall Street around 2008.\n\n\"Because it doesn't engage in speculative ventures that generate short-term fee income \u2014 think derivatives \u2014 a public bank is a return to more conservative banking,\" said Armstrong. \"This creates an incentive for good behavior, a return to the community-banking model that used to be so prevalent.\"\n\nThe North Dakota model\n\nThat local lending model still exists in places like Germany, which has a network of small banks mandated to work in the public interest, as well as in North Dakota, which owns the Bank of North Dakota \u2014 the nation's only state-owned bank and one of its most profitable. North Dakota's bank is what inspired Ellen Brown, the other co-founder of the Public Banking Institute, to look into the issue back in 2008. North Dakota had \"the lowest unemployment rate in the country, the lowest default rate and the most banks per capita,\" she said.\n\nThe Bank of North Dakota, whose mission is \"promot[ing] agriculture, commerce and industry in North Dakota,\" does not take retail deposits but acts as a partner to the state's commercial banks, essentially using its money to allow smaller banks to make loans in larger amounts than they would otherwise.\n\nAmending Los Angeles' city charter would be the first of many steps needed to make the bank a reality. And there's no agreement on what it will cost. A study conducted in 2011 for the state of Massachusetts estimated the cost of establishing a public bank there at $3.6 billion, extrapolating from the original cost of starting the Bank of North Dakota back in 1911.\n\nThe PBI disputes that number, which in any case would depend on the bank's capitalization, or how much cash it could tap to meet both its short-term and long-term obligations. The true figure could be as low as $100 million, said PBI's Brown. The city could raise that amount through bonds or by using some of the money it has stashed in \"rainy day\" funds. The PBI pointed out that American Samoa \u2014 an island with a population of 58,000 \u2014 was able to launch a public bank in April. It did so after the last commercial bank left the island two years prior.\n\nLow awareness\n\nFor the time being, though, uncertainty over cost isn't the main hurdle for the effort. It's that relatively few people know it exists.\n\n\"Within my circles, everyone's excited about it. I think beyond that, most people don't know about it,\" said Mike Dennis, a nonprofit worker who described himself as progressive. Dennis filled out his absentee ballot last week and was surprised to find Proposition B all the way at the back \u2014 after a series of county judicial candidates he wasn't familiar with. Still, he said, \"If it doesn't pass, I don't think it's a total loss. It moves the needle.\"\n\nHe added: \"I hope other cities are watching.\"", "", "", "", "", "The Nigerian Army appeared to adopt words used by President Trump this week to justify their own use of deadly force in a crackdown against Muslim protesters.\n\nIn a tweet, which has since been deleted, the Nigerian Army shared a video of Mr. Trump's ominous warning to migrants traveling in a U.S.\u2013bound caravan that if they throw rocks, U.S. troops will respond with lethal force.

He said: \"all the findings point to his body parts being melted.\" Khashoggi had entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to collect a document he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee.\n\nIn Bulgaria on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Khashoggi's slaying a horrendous act that \"should be duly dealt with\" in a way that doesn't undermine Saudi Arabia's stability.\n\nNetanyahu said at a news conference that Iran is a bigger threat than Saudi Arabia and those who want to punish the Middle East kingdom need to bear that in mind.\n\n\"A way must be found to achieve both goals, because I think that the larger problem is Iran,\" said the Israeli leader, who attended a meeting of the prime ministers of Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and the president of Serbia at a Black Sea resort.", "", "", "", "\"Sunday Morning\" took viewers today to watch wolves in Yellowstone National Park. The footage was by videographer Judy Lehmberg.\n\nGray wolves nearly became extinct by the mid-20th century, as they were killed by the thousands during the settlement of wild lands in North America. They would become protected under the Endangered Species Act in the mid-1970s, but they had been virtually extirpated from Yellowstone long before.\n\nIn the 1990s the Yellowstone Wolf Project reintroduced wolves into the park, in an attempt to right an ecosystem in which a key predator had been removed. Thirty-one wolves were captured in Canada and released into the park between 1995 and 1996. At it peak, in 2004, the wolf population in Yellowstone numbered 174.\n\nThe long-term health of the park's wolves is monitored by the Wolf Project, in order to learn more about the animal's relationships with key species and the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\nJudy Lehmberg\n\n\n\nSee also:", "The New York Police Department said Friday that James Polite, 20, of Brooklyn, was arrested in connection with anti-Semitic vandalism discovered at a synagogue the day before. The discovery had led to the cancellation on Thursday of a political event hosted by \"Broad City\" co-star Ilana Glazer.\n\nThe NYPD's hate crime division responded to complaints of vandalism in Prospect Heights' Union Temple on Thursday evening after congregants found hate speech, including \"kill all Jews\", written in black marker within the synagogue's stairwell, CBS New York reports. The suspect also drew a picture of the Puerto Rican flag and wrote \"Free P.R.\" The temple was set to host a interview with two local politicians moderated by comedian Ilana Glazer, but organizers of the event decided to cancel, citing safety concerns.\n\n\"We will not stand for this kind of activity in New York City,\" said NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea, calling the slurs \"pretty derogatory\" and \"hate filled.\"\n\nPolice said Polite was seen on a surveillance video wearing a red suit jacket and using a black marker to write messages throughout the building before fleeing.\n\nNYPD\n\nThe vandalism comes less than a week after 11 people were shot and killed inside a Pittsburgh synagogue in the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history. During the press conference, Shea said that hate crimes in New York were up 1 percent in 2018, and anti-Semitic crimes, like Thursday evening's, had been spiking the past 28 days.\n\nThe city's police department has increased patrols at the synagogue and other places of worship. Synagogue leaders at Union Temple say Shabbat services will go on as scheduled Friday night and Saturday morning.\n\n\"I got back from Pittsburgh on Wednesday after visiting the community there and seeing really the utter brokenness of that community and what they're going through,\" said Rabbi Jon Leener. \"And then to come back here and to feel unsafe here is really concerning.\"\n\nA preschool that operates in the building was also closed Friday.\n\n\"I'm just horrified. I work at the school here, the preschool. There's little kids in the building, and it's just, it's so upsetting,\" Janet Weeks told CBS New York.\n\nThe cancelled event was to have featured Glazer interviewing State Senate candidates Andrew Gounardes of South Brooklyn and Jim Gaughran of Long Island.\n\n\"Tonight's attack, right here in a temple in Brooklyn \u2013 is a painful reminder that anti-Semitism and prejudice are alive and well in our own community,\" Gounardes wrote in a statement released Thursday evening. \"Now more than ever, we have an obligation to reaffirm our commitment to tolerance and send a clear message that any individual or group who promotes violence and hate is not welcome in our City.\"\n\nGaughran also spoke out against the slurs during a Friday morning rally.\n\n\"This is a hate crime, and I think it was important that they cancelled the event so that we make sure everybody was protected,\" he said.", "Despite great news on jobs in October and talk of a possible U.S.-China trade deal in the works, U.S. stocks fell Friday as a big loss from Apple dragged technology companies lower and an increase in interest rates hurt high-dividend companies.\n\nThe iPhone maker, the world's largest technology company, forecast weak revenue growth Thursday evening and said it will stop disclosing quarterly phone sales. Apple shares fell 6.6 percent.\n\nStocks had surged over the previous three days and were still on pace for a big weekly gain after skidding in October to their worst monthly loss in seven years. But positive news Friday seemed to have little no impact on traders. The federal government said employers added 250,000 jobs in October, far more than analysts expected, and hourly pay jumped 3.1 percent, the most since the beginning of 2009.\n\nIn addition, President Donald Trump said Thursday he spoke with China's Xi Jinping and that trade discussions are \"moving along nicely,\" boosting Wall Street's hopes for a resolution to a deepening dispute that threatens tariffs and other penalties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of business activity between the two economic powers.\n\nThe Dow fell 110 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 25,271. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, lost 1 percent. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 0.2 percent.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose roughly 2 percent this week after strong gains the last three days, but would have to rally another 7.9 percent to match the all-time high it reached on Sept. 20.\n\nA hopeful start\n\nMany investors had started the day hopeful, with overseas stocks up sharply following Mr. Trump's announcement that he has asked U.S. officials to start drafting potential terms for a new trade agreement with China, with the president aiming to reach a new pact while at the Group of 20 nations summit in Argentina later in November, reported Bloomberg News.\n\nTrade tensions have weighed on investor sentiment because the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese imports sparked more than 100 publicly traded U.S. companies to disclose how much the import duties could hurt them, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab.\n\n\"Companies are saying 'this is biting and here's how,'\" she said. \"They're starting to talk about profit margins and whether they're going to pass the expenses onto consumers.\"\n\nMr. Trump didn't give details about his discussions with Xi, but there have been few signs of movement in the trade dispute in recent months, and investors are getting nervous about the prospect of huge tariff increases, with U.S. markets down almost 10 percent since their highs in August.\n\nJust had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade. Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina. Also had good discussion on North Korea! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2018\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told reporters the discussion was positive and that the two leaders were optimistic about resolving the dispute over trade practices and technology development that has resulted in both sides imposing penalty tariffs on each other's exports. Meanwhile, Chinese state media said Xi has promised tax cuts and other help to China's entrepreneurs in a renewed effort to revive the cooling, state-dominated Chinese economy.\n\nNot so fast: Continuing turmoil?\n\nYet until there's clarity on a trade deal, investors may continue to fret, noted CityIndex analyst Fiona Cincotta.\n\n\"A formal meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart will take place later this month at the G-20 summit and is likely to inject volatility into trading until the two sides reach a formal resolution over trade issues,\" she wrote in a research note.\n\nOctober brought a sudden, screeching halt to a milestone-setting September and snapped a six-month winning streak for the benchmark S&P 500 index. Last month clocked in as the worst month for the market since September 2011.\n\nInvestors may be on their toes until the trade dispute is resolved. Mr. Trump \"has been known to blow hot and cold before and during major negotiations and a positive comment today could easily turn into a less than flattering one tomorrow,\" Cincotta noted.\n\nOther analysts were outright skeptical of the prospects for a China trade deal. \"President Trump's reported request for his cabinet to draw up the outline of a 'deal' with China is likely an attempt to support a market rally heading into the midterm elections on November 6 rather than a sign of an imminent breakthrough,\" Height Capital's Clayton Allen argued in a note Friday.\n\nJobs, jobs, jobs\n\nThe Department of Labor said U.S. employers continued to add jobs at a fast clip in October, with no sign that hiring is slowing down. The proportion of Americans with jobs is at its highest level since January 2009, and the monthly increase in pay was also the largest since then. Along with high consumer confidence, those are all good signs for economic growth and consumer spending in the months to come.\n\nBond prices dropped, sending yields sharply higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 3.22 percent, from 3.14 percent. A jump in interest rates last month started the market's downturn, but investors on Friday didn't seem as worried about the increase. \"It clearly was a good report,\" said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nThe wage number, while high, was about what investors were expecting, Lefkowitz said. That's important because investors are still sensitive to signs that inflation could flare up, forcing the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in raising rates. If inflation grows moderately, as it appeared to in October, that's not as likely.\n\nApple cored\n\nApple's sales in its latest quarter and its estimates for the holiday season both disappointed experts. The tech giant also surprised investors by saying it will no longer disclose the number of iPhones it sells each quarter. Apple was unique among big smartphone makers in saying how many phones it sold and what the average price was. Apple gets most of its revenue from iPhone sales and lately it's boosted its profits by selling higher-priced models.\n\nThe unexpected change raised suspicions that Apple might be trying to mask a downturn in the phone's popularity. The company says the quarterly numbers and prices didn't necessarily tell investors how strong its business has been.", "Georgia must make it easier for voters flagged as potential noncitizens to prove their U.S. citizenship at the polls, a federal judge ruled Friday in an injunction ordering the state to change its procedure just four days before Election Day.\n\nA spokeswoman for state Attorney General Chris Carr did not immediately say whether the state would appeal. Spokeswoman Katie Byrd said state attorneys were reviewing the order.\n\nThe injunction by U.S. District Court Judge Eleanor L. Ross addresses a specific issue that arose from a broader lawsuit by civil rights groups who in October filed a broader challenge to Georgia's \"exact match\" verification process. The state requires identification information on voter registration applications to precisely match information already on file with the Georgia Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration.\n\nSome mismatches are triggered by variations in a name, like a dropped hyphen, or because of data entry errors. Other people are flagged as potential noncitizens, often because the state driver's license database hasn't been updated to reflect their naturalization. Roughly 51,100 Georgians have been flagged as ineligible to vote because of such registration problems.\n\nThe judge ruled the state unfairly burdens about 3,100 possible voters whose registration was flagged for citizenship issues, because only a deputy registrar is allowed to clear them to vote a regular ballot when the voters show proof of citizenship at the polls. She noted voters flagged for issues other than citizenship can be cleared by any poll worker after showing a photo ID.\n\n\"This raises grave concerns for the Court about the differential treatment inflicted on a group of individuals who are predominantly minorities,\" Ross' order said. \"... The election scheme here places a severe burden on these individuals.\"\n\nShe ruled that Georgia must immediately start allowing poll managers, in addition to deputy registrars, to clear flagged voters who show proof of citizenship.\n\nThe lawsuit says the \"exact-match\" policy disproportionately affects black, Latino and Asian-American applicants trying to register. It was filed against Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the state's top elections official and the Republican candidate for governor. He's locked in a tight, nationally watched race against Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is trying to become the nation's first black female governor. Abrams has accused Kemp of engaging in voter suppression, which he has denied.\n\nKemp's office has been allowing voters flagged over citizenship issues to cast ballots after showing proof of citizenship, such as a U.S. passport, at the polls. In cases where a deputy registrar isn't available to clear the voter in person and can't be reached by phone, flagged voters were to be given provisional ballots marked with a poll worker's note that the voter showed proof of citizenship.\n\nIn a statement, Kemp spokesperson Candace Broce said that the secretary of state approved of the ruling.\n\n\"Earlier today, Judge May recognized that changing existing election procedures at the last minute is a terrible idea. There are already processes in place for individuals to rectify any issues to cast their ballot. We agree with the Judge's decision. In a separate ruling, Judge Ross acknowledged that Georgia already has a process in place to check citizenship at the polls. She decided to also allow poll managers to participate in the verification process. It is a minor change to the current system,\" Broce said.\n\nCristina Correia, a lawyer for the state, said at a hearing on the issue Monday that those provisional ballots would be counted with no further action required by the voter.\n\nJulie Houk, a lawyer for the civil rights groups, said that's not what's happening. She told the story of a recently naturalized citizen who went to a Fulton County early voting location where there was no deputy registrar present. The poll manager didn't send the man's citizenship proof to a deputy registrar to clear the flag, Houk said, and he wasn't offered a chance to vote on a provisional ballot to be counted as a regular ballot.\n\nThe judge said in her order that the man's troubles voting came \"after he had already submitted proof of citizenship with his voter registration application. This is beyond the merely inconvenient.\"\n\nWatch Special Election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV.

The day before, Mr. Trump said he wanted the military to treat any rocks thrown at them like a \"rifle,\" and act accordingly.\n\nThe president seemed to dial back his rhetoric on Friday, saying he hopes the military doesn't have to fire on members of the caravan approaching the U.S. Some members of the caravan threw rocks at the Mexican military, prompting Mr. Trump's claim Thursday that the military should treat rocks like weapons.\n\n\"We will consider that the maximum that we can consider that because they're throwing rocks viciously and violently,\" he said Thursday. \"You saw that three days ago. Really hurting the military. We're not going to put up with that. They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We're going to consider it, and I told them consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police I say consider it a rifle.\"\n\nMr. Trump has focused his energy on U.S. immigration laws and cracking down on illegal immigration in the days ahead of the midterms. His proposals include, among other things, sending up to 15,000 troops to the border. On Friday, the president said anyone who throws rocks will simply be \"arrested.\"\n\n\"No, they won't have to fire,\" the president said. \"What I don't want is I don't want these people throwing rocks. It's turned out, in fact it was just announced by Homeland Security, you have in just certain areas over 300 people that they know are trouble. What they did to the Mexican military is a disgrace. They hit them with rocks and some of them are very seriously injured and they were throwing rocks in their face. They do that, they're going to be arrested. There's going to be problems.\"\n\n\"I didn't say shoot,\" Mr. Trump added Friday. \"I didn't say shoot, but they do that with us, they're going to be arrested for a long time.\"\n\nIn the last week, the president has claimed he will end birthright citizenship and the ability to apply for asylum other than at designated points of entry. On Friday, the president said the Supreme Court will decide the issue birthright citizenship, which he hopes to terminate either through executive order or Congress.\n\n\"You know who's going to determine that? The Supreme Court of the United States,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The Supreme Court will, the Supreme Court will determine that.\"", "ISLAMABAD -- The release of a Christian woman in Pakistan, acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy, was delayed Friday after authorities agreed to bar her from flying abroad following talks with radical Islamists who want her publicly hanged. The agreement between the government and the Tehreek-e-Labbaik party was reached in the city of Lahore, where Islamists have been rallying for days.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court overturned the 2010 conviction of Asia Bibi for insulting the Prophet Muhammad. Pakistani authorities will now not allow Bibi to leave the country until the Supreme Court makes a final review of its verdict, said provincial minister Noorul Haq Qadri, according to the agreement.\n\nIn return, protests in major cities would cease, the government's religious affairs minister told Geo TV, according to the Reuters news agency. It comes a day after Ghulam Mustafa, the lawyer representing a provincial cleric in Punjab who had filed the initial blasphemy charges against Bibi, petitioned the Supreme Court requesting that the judges review her acquittal.\n\nThe court has not set a date to take up the petition. Pakistan's Supreme Court has not been known to reverse its decisions but court reviews typically take years.\n\nBibi's ordeal will continue until the review is completed. The latest development will likely irk rights groups calling for the release of Bibi, who has spent nine years in jail since her arrest in 2009.\n\nWhat did Asia Bibi do\n\nShe was accused of blasphemy following a quarrel with two fellow female farm workers who refused to drink from a water container used by a Christian. A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam's prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction.\n\nBibi's family has always maintained her innocence and said she never made such an insult. Since Wednesday's landmark ruling over Bibi's acquittal, radical Islamists have blocked highways and damaged or set fire to dozens of vehicles to pressure the government to prevent Bibi's release from an undisclosed detention facility.\n\nEarlier, during the day, some 5,000 Islamists rallied in the capital, Islamabad, and nearly 4,000 demonstrators staged a sit-in in the eastern city of Lahore, demanding that Bibi's acquittal verdict be overturned. Similar rallies were also held in the northwestern city of Peshawar; there were no reports of violence.\n\nOver 2,000 demonstrators blocked a key road linking Islamabad with the garrison city of Rawalpindi, causing traffic jams. Hundreds also blocked another key motorway, connecting Islamabad with other major cities.\n\nReuters/Mohsin Raza\n\nNo violence was reported during the rallies. Earlier, Pakistan shut down schools and colleges after radical cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the leader of Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, announced that \"talks\" between his deputies and the government about Bibi's fate had failed.\n\nBefore dawn Friday, Rizvi had told an emotionally charged rally in Lahore that one of the government negotiators threatened his deputies during the talks that security forces would ruthlessly kill them if they did not disperse peacefully. He asked his supporters to continue sit-ins as authorities summoned paramilitary troops to restore order.\n\n\"We are ready to die to show our love for the prophet,\" he said. Rizvi's envoys had demanded that Bibi be barred from leaving the country but Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry initially rejected the demand, saying the government will not accept any dictates.\n\nInterior Minister Sheharyar Afridi said Friday that officials were trying to persuade Islamists to disperse their rallies peacefully. Authorities also stepped up security near the facility where Bibi was being held for her safety.\n\nOn Thursday, prison officials said two inmates were arrested last month for planning to strangle Bibi to death. They said the men were still being questioned.\n\nBibi's family had expected her release by Thursday night. Her husband, Ashiq Masih, returned from Britain with their children in mid-October and was waiting for her release so that they could fly out of Pakistan.\n\nThough the family has not disclosed the country of her destination, France and Spain have offered asylum. Islamabad authorities suspended mobile phone services in the city for 10 hours on Friday, likely to prevent the crowds from swelling further in the capital.\n\nBibi's acquittal has posed a challenge to the government of Pakistan's new prime minister, Imran Khan, who came to power this summer partly by pursuing the Islamist agenda. Khan condemned the Islamists on Wednesday after cleric Afzal Qadri urged supporters to kill the three judges who acquitted Bibi, revolt against army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa and overthrow Khan's government.\n\nMilitary spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said Friday the army was exercising restraint, to provide a chance for a peaceful resolution. He asked demonstrators to refrain from violence and await the outcome of the review petition to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Let this legal process be completed first,\" he told state-run Pakistan Television.", "Forty years ago Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) was nearly killed in a savage attack while on a fact-finding mission into Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple cult. She told \"Sunday Morning\" about how that formative moment changed her:\n\nIn November 1978 I was an attorney on the staff of Congressman Leo Ryan, part of the mission he brought to Guyana to investigate Jim Jones, the wildly charismatic leader of the Peoples Temple.\n\nWe had received credible reports of his followers being abused and held against their will.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe compound was impressive. Members of Jonestown were certainly saying all the right things, no matter how rote. But someone slipped us a note asking for help. I felt my stomach turn into hard knots of terror, as we realized our worst fears about Jones and his followers were true \u2013 and we were in grave danger.\n\nWhen cameras were rolling, he spoke of how he loved his followers and would always have a place for them, but off camera he muttered about treason and liars. He was cracking, and all I wanted to do was get out of there.\n\nRyan assigned me to escort the first airlift out of Jonestown. As I was loading defectors on the two planes, a tractor trailer with seven gunmen arrived at the airstrip.\n\nCBS News\n\nThe gunmen opened fire on us at point-blank range.\n\nFive bullets pierced my body. Congressman Ryan and four others lay dead.\n\nWhat I didn't know then was that more than 900 followers of Jones (including hundreds of children) would later that night ingest cyanide at his command, an act some call suicide, but I call murder.\n\nCBS News\n\nI was helped into the baggage compartment for safety and later moved to a tent on the airstrip where I waited 22 hours for help to arrive.\n\nSurviving against unimaginable odds can make every day that follows swell with a renewed sense of purpose.\n\nWe don't get to choose our formative moments. Very often, adversity and failure shape us more permanently than fortune and success. That has certainly been the case in my life. Pain yields action; it can introduce a fervor to speak out for those whose voices are not heard.\n\nSurviving Jonestown crystallized where I needed to focus my energy.

Variations of the AR-15 were used to kill at a Texas church, a Las Vegas concert, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida and Sandy Hook Elementary School. The AR-15 style rifle is the most popular rifle in America. There are well over 11 million, and they are rarely used in crime. Handguns kill far more people, but the AR-15 is the choice of our worst mass murderers. AR-15 ammunition travels up to three times the speed of sound. And tonight we're going to slow that down - so you can see why the AR-15's high-velocity ammo is the fear of every American emergency room\n\nMass shootings were once so shocking they were impossible to forget. Now they've become so frequent it's hard to remember them all. Last Saturday, in the Pittsburgh Synagogue, 11 were killed, six wounded.\n\nFBI Special Agent Robert Jones: This is the most horrific scene I've seen in 22 years with the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Members of the Tree of Life Synagogue conducting a peaceful service in their place of worship were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith.\n\nJust 11 months before, it was a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Assistant fire chief Rusty Duncan was among the first to arrive.\n\nRusty Duncan: 90 percent of the people in there were unrecognizable. You know the blood everywhere, I mean it just covered them from head to toe. They were shot in so many different places that you just couldn't make out who they were.\n\nThe church is now a memorial to the 26 who were murdered.\n\nRusty Duncan: I've never had the experience, not with any kind of weapon like this. For me to see the damage that it did was unbelievable, it was shattering concrete, I-- you know, you can only imagine what it does to a human body.\n\nScott Pelley: The police estimate that he fired about 450 rounds.\n\nRusty Duncan: Oh, I believe it. I saw the damage it did. I saw the holes in the church from one side to the other, all the pews, the concrete, the carpet, I saw it all.\n\nA gunshot wound is potentially fatal no matter what kind of ammunition is used. But Cynthia Bir showed us the difference in an AR-15 round against gelatin targets in her ballistics lab at the University of Southern California.\n\nCynthia Bir: Years of research have gone in to kind of what the makeup should be of this ordnance gelatin to really represent what damage you would see in your soft tissues.\n\nScott Pelley: So this is a pretty accurate representation of what would happen to a human being?\n\nCynthia Bir: Yeah, this is currently considered kind of the state of the art.\n\n\"Organs aren't just going to tear or have bruises on them, they're going to be, parts of them are going to be destroyed.\"\n\nThis is a 9 millimeter bullet from a handgun, which we captured in slow motion.

So what happens is, this particular round is designed to tumble and break apart.\n\nThe 9 mm handgun round has a larger bullet, but this AR-15 round has more gunpowder, accelerating its velocity. Both the round and the rifle were designed in the 1950's for the military. The result was the M16 for our troops and the AR-15 for civilians.\n\nCynthia Bir: There's going to be a lot more damage to the tissues, both bones, organs, whatever gets kind of even near this bullet path. The bones aren't going to just break, they're going to shatter. Organs aren't just going to tear or have bruises on them, they're going to be, parts of them are going to be destroyed.\n\nThat fairly describes the wounds suffered by 29-year-old Joann Ward. At Sutherland Springs Baptist Church she was shot more than 20 times while covering her children. Ward was dead, her daughters mortally wounded, as assistant fire chief Rusty Duncan made his way from the back of the sanctuary.\n\nRusty Duncan: As I got a couple of rows up, Ryland's hand reached out from under his stepmom and grabbed my pant leg. I wouldn't even known he was alive until he did that. I didn't even see him under her. Well, that's where me and him made eye contact for the first time.\n\nJoann Ward's five-year-old stepson Ryland Ward was hit five times and was nearly gone when he reached trauma surgeon Lillian Liao at San Antonio's University Hospital.\n\nScott Pelley: How much of Ryland's blood do you think was lost before he came to you?\n\nLillian Liao: At least half.\n\nThis is Ryland's ER X-ray.\n\nLillian Liao: You see the two bullet fragments that are in him.\n\nScott Pelley: The X-ray shows you the solid fragments of the shrapnel and the bullets, but it doesn't tell you much about the damage to the soft tissue.\n\nLillian Liao: No, and it doesn't tell you what's on the inside. I mean a bomb went off on the inside. And our job is to go in there and clean it up.\n\nScott Pelley: A bomb went off on the inside because of the shockwave from these high-velocity rounds.\n\nLillian Liao: Correct.\n\nRyland endured 24 surgeries to repair his arm, leg, pelvis, intestines, kidney, bladder and hip.\n\nLillian Liao: At some point it's like putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.\n\nScott Pelley: What do you mean?\n\nLillian Liao: Well his organs are now in different pieces and you have to reconstruct them. The arm was missing soft tissue, skin, muscle and part of the nerves were damaged. The bowel has to be put back together some of the areas of injury has to heal itself so you can see that he can walk around like a normal child and behave as normal as possible.\n\nWith the AR-15, it's not just the speed of the bullet, but also how quickly hundreds of bullets can be fired. The AR-15 is not a fully automatic machine gun. It fires only one round with each pull of the trigger. But in Las Vegas last year, it sounded like a machine gun.\n\nA special add-on device called a bump stock allowed the killer to pull the trigger rapidly enough to kill 58 and wound 489. In other mass killings the AR-15 was fired without a bump stock, but even then, it can fire about 60 rounds a minute. Ammunition magazines that hold up to 100 rounds can be changed in about five seconds.\n\nMaddy Wilford: I remember hearing the gunshots go off and being so nervous and scared and all of the sudden I felt something hit me.\n\nScott Pelley: You'd been shot how many times?\n\nMaddy Wilford: Four times.\n\nScott Pelley: How many surgeries?\n\nMaddy Wilford: Three. For my arm, my stomach and my ribs and lung.\n\nLast February, 17-year-old Maddy Wilford was at school, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. 17 were murdered, 17 wounded.\n\nMaddy Wilford: And I just remember thinking to myself, there's no way, like, not me, please, not me. I don't wanna go yet.\n\nLaz Ojeda: Her vital signs were almost nonexistent. she looked like all the blood had gone out of her body. She was in a state of deep shock.\n\nParamedic Laz Ojeda saved Maddy Wilford, in part, because Broward County EMS recently equipped itself for the battlefield wounds that the AR-15 inflicts.\n\nLaz Ojeda: We carry active-killer kits in our rescues.\n\nScott Pelley: Active-killer kits?\n\nLaz Ojeda: Yes.\n\nScott Pelley: What is that?\n\nLaz Ojeda: That is a kit that has five tourniquets, five decompression needles, five hemostatic agents, five emergency trauma dressings.\n\nDr. Peter Antevy, Broward County Medical Director, told us today's wounds demand a new kind of training.\n\nPeter Antevy: If I take you through one of our ambulances or take you through our protocols, almost everything we do is based on what the military has taught us. We never used to carry tourniquets. We never used to carry chest seals. These were things that were done in the military for many, many years.\n\nScott Pelley: When did all of that change?\n\nPeter Antevy: It really changed I think after Sandy Hook.\n\nAfter Sandy Hook Elementary School where 20 first graders and six educators were killed with AR-15 rounds, a campaign called \"Stop the Bleed\" began nationwide. Antevy and doctors including Lillian Liao in San Antonio, are training civilians who are truly the first responders. There have been nearly 30 thousand classes like this in the last three years.\n\nPeter Antevy: The day after the shooting, my kids, they're waking up, and they're \"time to go to school.\" And, my son heard kind of heard what happened the night before, when I was on the scene, and he looked at me with the fear of God that he had to go to school that day. My first instinct was, \"He needs a bleeding kit.\" My son today has a bleeding kit on his person.\n\nScott Pelley: How old is he?\n\nPeter Antevy: 12 years old. Here it is. This is it. We, we, I've given him this and I've taught him how to use it.\n\nScott Pelley: You believe that these mass casualty events have become so common \u2013\n\nPeter Antevy: Absolutely.\n\nScott Pelley: \u2013 that it is important for everyone in this country to be prepared.\n\nPeter Antevy: Everyone.\n\nScott Pelley: That's where we are in America today?\n\nPeter Antevy: That's where we are.\n\nRyland Ward survived the church massacre because firefighter Rusty Duncan used his belt as a tourniquet.\n\nOver this last year Ryland has worked, often six days a week, learning to sit, stand, and walk again.\n\nRyland Ward: I'm going to see if this actually goes in the hospital. Yep.\n\nScott Pelley: Did you meet some new people in the hospital? You were there for a long time.\n\nRyland Ward: How do you know?\n\nScott Pelley: They told me. I talked to some of the people who helped you.\n\nRyland Ward: Like who?\n\nScott Pelley: There was, uh, Doctor \u2013\n\nRyland Ward: Liao?\n\nScott Pelley: Doctor Liao, yes.\n\nHe has his strength back. Its remarkable, really. But healing from the loss of his stepmother and sisters won't be as quick.\n\nMaddy Wilford is also moving forward. Like many who suffer physical trauma, her interests have turned to medicine and an internship where she is studying the kind of surgeries that saved her.\n\nNot long ago, many communities assumed mass murder would never come to them\n\nToday, all Americans are being asked to prepare for the grievous wounds of high-velocity rounds.\n\nProduced by Ashley Velie. Associate producer, Dina Zingaro.", "Former President Obama is in Georgia Friday evening to rally for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who is locked in a tight race with Republican Brian Kemp, capping off a day of campaign events for Democrats. Mr. Obama emphasized this election could be the \"most important of our lifetime\" while also highlighting Abrams.\n\n\"I'm hear for one simple reason: To ask you to vote,\" Mr. Obama said. \"The consequences of any of us staying home are profound because America is at a crossroads ... The character of our country is on the ballot.\"\n\nIn an earlier rally on Friday, Mr. Obama had said he doesn't understand why Mr. Trump and his supporters are \"so angry all the time.\" At the Atlanta rally, Mr. Obama accused Republicans of using \"constant, incessant, non-stop attempts to divide us. Rhetoric that is designed to make us angry \u2014 to make us fearful.\"\n\nMr. Obama criticized Republicans \u2014 and especially Mr. Trump \u2014 for the \"scare tactics\" in the election.\n\n\"Now in the year 2018, they are telling you the biggest threat to America are some impoverished refugees thousands of miles away,\" Mr. Obama said. \"That's not enough to lie about it \u2014 they are sending our brave troops ... they are sending them down there for a political stunt when they could be with their families.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, Mr. Obama traveled to Florida to rally for Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, two days after President Trump visited the state to stump for their Republican opponents. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama is engaged in a final campaign swing before the midterm elections. He is campaigning against Mr. Trump's agenda and Republican candidates less than two years after he left office, a departure from a historical norm in which former presidents tend to avoid openly criticizing their successors.\n\nAbrams' campaign has attracted support from prominent celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, who has canvassed and rallied with the candidate. Actor Michael B. Jordan has knocked on doors in Atlanta urging black voters to turn out and actor and comedian Will Ferrell has also canvassed for Abrams' campaign.\n\nAbrams has been largely focused on turning out communities which don't usually turn out in high numbers during midterm elections, such as black voters and young people. If elected, Abrams would be the first black woman elected governor in the country. Mr. Obama is rallying with Abrams at Morehouse College, a widely respected historically black college.\n\nThe Georgia gubernatorial race has been roiled by claims of voter suppression. As Georgia secretary of state, Kemp oversees election infrastructure, which Democrats say presents a conflict of interest. Kemp's office has suspended processing 53,000 voter registrations, 70 percent of which are for black Georgians. He did so under the auspices of a 2017 state law passed under his urging, which requires an \"exact match\" between a voter registration form and government documents. If a person's voter registration form differs from government documents \u2014 even by a hyphen or a misspelling \u2014 their registration form is considered suspect.\n\nWhile Abrams has claimed Kemp is deliberately trying to suppress the votes of black Georgians, who typically vote Democratic, Kemp argues the issues with registration forms are due to shoddy work by liberal groups such as the Abrams-founded New Georgia Project, which works to register minority voters. However, the 53,000 voters with pending applications can still vote on election day, if they present photo identification at the polls.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump is rallying for Kemp. Vice President Mike Pence stumped for Kemp on Thursday, and criticized the star power Abrams' campaign has attracted.\n\n\"I heard Oprah's in town today,\" Pence said. \"I'm kind of a big deal too and I've got a message, I've got a message for all of Stacey Abrams' liberal Hollywood friends. This ain't Hollywood. This is Georgia.\"", "Investigators on Friday shared new details in the deaths of two Saudi Arabian sisters whose bodies were found in a New York City river.\n\nThe bodies of Rotana Farea, 23, and Tala Farea, 16, were discovered on October 24. They were both fully-clothed and bound together by duct tape when they were found on a bank of the Hudson River.\n\nThe sisters first left their family's home in Fairfax, Virginia, back in November last year. They were sent to a \"shelter-like facility\" after abuse allegations came up against members of their family, said NYPD Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea. The girls went missing from the facility around August 23.\n\n\"It was raised that they were the subject of abuse,\" Shea said.\n\nElectronic court records indicated the sisters took Uber taxis to New York and arrived on September 1, Shea said. The sisters were shopping, ordering two meals a day and staying at a number of high-end hotels until money on Rotana's personal credit card ran out.\n\nVideo surveillance showed the sisters alone, apparently in good health several days before they were discovered, Shea said.\n\n\"There is a strong possibility that money was running out,\" Shea said.\n\nShea also said investigators spoke with non-family sources who said the sisters would have preferred to harm themselves than return to Saudi Arabia.\n\nA passerby who frequently exercised in Riverside Park said he was jogging for his daily exercise routine Monday morning and witnessed two girls sitting together with their hands in their heads, loudly praying near the scene where they were found later that day.\n\nShea said they were found in an area where they could easily walk into the water on their own volition.\n\n\"We have no credible information that any crime took place in New York City,\" Shea said. \"It is entirely credible the girls entered the water alive,\" Shea said.", "CHICAGO \u2014 Seven more people have had their drug convictions dismissed after convincing prosecutors and a judge that they were framed by a disgraced former Chicago Police sergeant. Since 2016, at least 50 people convicted in cases investigated by former Sgt. Ronald Watts and officers under his command have been exonerated.\n\nOn Friday, a Cook County judge overturned the convictions of six men and one woman. All said they had drugs planted drugs on them or were otherwise framed by Watts and his crew.\n\nThe exonerations are part of an ongoing investigation into Watts.\n\nDozens of men and women have said Watts and his team terrorized them in or near the former Ida B. Wells housing project in Bronzeville between 2003 and 2008, CBS Chicago reports. Prosecutors have said Watts and the officers under his command routinely planted evidence and fabricated charges in order to further their own gun and drug trade.\n\nWatts and another officer pleaded guilty in 2013 to stealing money from an FBI informant posing as a drug dealer. Watts admitted to routinely extorting money from drug dealers, and was sentenced to 22 months in prison.\n\nIn September, 18 men were exonerated of drug charges brought by Watts and his officers, and another man was cleared soon after, reports CBS Chicago. Those 19 men returned to court on Friday to receive their official certificates of innocence.\n\nMany of those who have had their convictions overturned said they faced significant challenges even after they finished serving time in prison, the station reports.\n\n\"It prevented me from doing a lot; a job. I'm 42, and I haven't worked a day in my life,\" said Vondell Wilbourn, who was twice framed by Watts, in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe Conviction Integrity Unit in the office of Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx is still working on dozens of cases tied to Watts, trying to determine if any other convictions were the result of frame-ups. Defense attorneys have asked for dozens of convictions to be overturned.", "Alec Baldwin is in custody after getting arrested for assault, according to police. The incident took place in New York's Sixth precinct.\n\nCBS New York reports that Baldwin was arrested around 1 p.m. after he got into an altercation over a parking spot on East 10th Street in Greenwich Village.\n\nIn a tweet late Friday, Baldwin wrote \"the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false.\" Baldwin posted that \"it has become a sport\" to tag people with \"negative charges and defaming allegations as possible for the purposes of clickbait entertainment.\"\n\nThe actor is famous for his temper; in 2007, an angry voicemail Baldwin left for his daughter, Ireland, was leaked onto the internet and went viral. In the message, he screamed at his daughter for not picking up his scheduled call. He called her a \"pig\" and threatened to \"straighten [her] out.\"\n\nIn 2011, he was kicked off a flight for refusing to turn off his phone. He said he was playing Words with Friends. And in 2014, police arrested Baldwin after he was riding his bike the wrong way on the street and acting belligerent toward officers.\n\nPolice said the \"30 Rock\" star reacted belligerently after he was asked to show ID. He was issued a summons for riding a bike the wrong way and for disorderly conduct.", "The biggest shopping day of the year will start even earlier in 2018. Black Friday is the traditional kick-off to the holiday shopping season, occurring on the Friday after Thanksgiving. This year, retailers are revealing their Black Friday deals in early November, with some, like Lowe's, offering deals as early as Nov. 1, and others rolling out free shipping for online shoppers to compete with new offers from Amazon.com.\n\nThere's a method behind the Black Friday creep, with retailers trying to get consumers to shop all month, rather than only after Thanksgiving. And there's more at stake this year, given forecasts that consumers will boost spending as much as 5 percent this holiday season. Strong consumer confidence and a growing economy are adding up to a jolly holiday season, despite headwinds such higher interest rates.\n\nHome improvement giant Lowe's started offering Black Friday specials on Nov. 1, including a 40 percent discount on some appliances. It's also offering a $50 gift card with the purchase of some artificial trees during November.\n\nOne of the major battles this holiday season will be over toys, with retailers slugging it out to grab market share in the wake of Toys R Us' closure, said Philip Dengler of BestBlackFriday.com.\n\n\"With Toys R Us out of business, all of the major retailers, including Best Buy, Amazon, Target and Walmart, are fighting for a share of the toy market,\" he said. \"Each has already released holiday toy lists and toy books, and they will all be expanding their selection of toys this year.\"\n\nStill, Dengler recommends waiting until mid-December to find the lowest prices on toys. Here are some tips and deals recommended by BestBlackFriday.com.\n\nKohl's for electronics\n\nConsumers don't usually think of Kohl's as a source for electronics, but the department store chain will have some good deals this year, Dengler said. For instance, it will offer the Microsoft Xbox One S 1TB Minecraft Creators Console bundle for $199.99, with buyers receiving $60 in \"Kohl's Cash\" -- a coupon that can be redeemed for that amount on Kohl's merchandise -- which must be used from Nov. 24 trhough Dec. 5. That's a savings of $100 on the product's normal retail price.\n\n\"It is often possible to get better overall pricing on electronics at Kohl's compared to Best Buy, Walmart and Amazon when taking into account the Kohl's Cash,\" Denger said.\n\nKohl's will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving and offer its \"doorbuster\" deals until 1 p.m. on Black Friday. It will also offer $15 in Kohl's Cash for every $50 spent in the store from Nov. 19-23.\n\nTarget for electronics, home items and toys\n\nTarget will offer attractive discounts on those items, such as its doorbuster deal for an Instant Pot Duo 6-qt 7-in-1 Pressure Cooker with a free $10 Target Gift Card for $69.95.\n\n\"This is a popular item every single year on Black Friday, and Target is positioning itself to potentially have the best price by including the $10 gift card,\" Dengler said.\n\nLike Kohl's, Target will open at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving, or an hour earlier than in 2017.\n\niPhone deals\n\nTypically a sought-after holiday item, iPhones are no exception in 2018. Holiday deals on the new iPhone XS and XS Max will be available at Target and Sam's Club, with Target offering a $250 gift card for the latest versions of the iPhones (with qualified activation at Verizon, Sprint or AT&T). Sam's Club, for its part, will offer up to a $300 Sam's Club gift card when customers purchase some iPhone models.\n\nFree online shipping\n\nConsumers shouldn't pay for shipping for online shopping on Black Friday because so many retailers are offering free shipping, Dengler said. Many online Black Friday sales will start on Monday, Nov. 19.\n\n\"Target is offering free two-day shipping with no minimum order size this holiday season, which is the best policy, in our opinion,\" he noted. \"Best Buy is offering free standard shipping with no minimum, which is still solid.\"\n\nWalmart is offering free two-day shipping on orders of more than $35, but for purchases under that amount Dengler advised using the retailer's e-commerce site for purchases under that amount.\n\nWatch for more shipping news this month. Amazon on Sunday announced it will offer free shipping on all holiday orders in time for Christmas, doing away with a minimum purchase price \u2014 even if you aren't a Prime member.\n\nThe company had previously set a threshold of $25 for orders to qualify for free shipping, but Amazon will waive that requirement starting Monday, according to the company. Hundreds of millions of items will therefore become eligible for free shipping.\n\nPrime members, who are already entitled to free two-day shipping, will also receive a new perk: More than 3 million items will be available for same-day delivery during the holiday season.\n\n-- CBS News' Peter Martinez contributed to this report.", "Actor Todd LaTourrette, who played Skell on \"Better Call Saul,\" is coming clean after years of pretending to be a wounded veteran who lost his arm overseas. He said he actually cut off and cauterized his arm himself.\n\nHe said that his injury made him more appealing to casting agents. \"The film industry obviously took a different angle. That I was different. And so they liked that,\" the actor told KOB4 in New Mexico.\n\nLaTourrette said he is biopolar and was off his meds when he cut off his arm 17 years ago.\n\n\"I severed my hand with a skill saw,\" he explained. \"The state of my mind was a psychotic episode.\"\n\nAfter his episode, LaTourrette was cast in the film \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\" and TV show \"Better Call Saul,\" telling people he was an injured vet. Now he said he is finding it hard to face his own lies.\n\n\"I was dishonorable,\" LaTourrette told KOB4. \"I'm killing my career by doing this, if anyone thinks this was for personal edification, that's not the case.\"\n\nLaTourrette said he wants his story to help others who are struggling with mental illness.\n\n\"The power is in your hands to take your medication in the morning, or at night,\" he said. \"So that, this, this discourse of my life doesn't need to necessarily be yours.

The protester then started blowing a whistle and Obama addressed the individual again.\n\n\"If you support the other candidates, then you should support the other candidates,\" Obama said. \"Go to their rallies.\"\n\nPeriodically the crowd chanted to drown out the protester: \"Bring it home! Bring it home!\"\n\n\"Why is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time,\" Obama asked. \"When I won the presidency, at least my side felt pretty good.\"\n\nWe have seen rhetoric designed to divide us, the former president told the crowd. \"In four days, you can be a check on that kind of behavior,\" Obama said in a speech that embraced themes of inclusivity and social justice. You can choose a more generous vision of America, \"where love and hope conquer hate,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Gillum will expand Medicaid coverage, Obama said, and he promised Democrats \"won't let Republicans gut your health care.\"\n\nRight at election time, the former president said, Republicans have started to say they'll protect pre-existing conditions, when they've been doing the opposite.\n\n\"Let's call that what it is: it's a lie,\" Obama said.\n\nEarly voting in Florida is already on pace to surpass turnout in the last five midterm elections in the state. On Friday for the first time, over 4 million had voted early, with more Republicans than Democrats casting votes so far.\n\nElection Day will wrap up a bitter campaign season that witnessed the battle between DeSantis and Gillum veer into racial politics and heated exchanges over a long-simmering FBI investigation involving Gillum's home city.\n\nRight after the primary, DeSantis said Florida voters shouldn't \"monkey this up\" by electing Gillum, a comment Democrats contend was racially charged. President Trump also called Gillum a \"thief\" and corrupt, a move the mayor says is meant to reinforce negative stereotypes of black men.\n\nThe Gillum campaign, meanwhile, cut ties with a Democratic Party vendor and a campaign volunteer caught on video calling Florida a \"cracker\" state and saying the campaign was taking advantage of \"white guilt.\"\n\nThe Senate race between Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson has taken a back seat to the governor's race, but it too has centered largely on name-calling and insults lobbed in tens of millions of dollars' worth of negative television ads.

One of the most surprisingly competitive races has been unfolding in Texas. The Senate election there pitting incumbent Ted Cruz in the red corner, against challenger Beto O'Rourke in the blue corner, represents more than just gripping political theater, a clash of big personalities, and record-setting fundraising. On the surface, the candidates have plenty in common: two Texans a year apart in age who left the state for Ivy League schools before returning. They were even elected to Congress the same day six years ago. But in this divided cultural and political moment, Cruz-O'Rourke has become a national barometer for American politics, in the unlikeliest of places.\n\n\"I don't know that there could be much more on the line than there is today. I don't know if the choices could be any more clear, the contrast any greater.\"\n\nGov. Greg Abbott: As goes Texas, so will go the future of the United States of America! [CHEERS]\n\nAt age 47, Senator Ted Cruz has gone from Tea Party disruptor to Republican Party stalwart.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott: I welcome my good friend, your Senator Ted Cruz! [CHEERS]\n\nOn a recent Sunday, he shared the stage with Texas Governor Greg Abbott in a roadhouse in his hometown of Houston.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: God bless Texas! [CHEERS]\n\nCruz is equally familiar with the levers of power\u2026 and the art of politics.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: Now why is it that people come to Texas? Because Texas is where the opportunity is. Because Texas is where the freedom is!\n\nWe sat down with the incumbent at a Houston BBQ joint.\n\nJon Wertheim: We've had our cameras following you for weeks. You're, you're working hard out there. What are the central principles you're trying to get across?\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: When I ran six years ago, I told the people of Texas I'd fight every day for low taxes, low regulations, and lots of jobs. My twin passions in life have been the American free enterprise system and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn this solidly red state, Cruz comes to battle armed with a loyal base: gun rights advocates, suburbanites, evangelicals, and big business. He also has the support of the sitting president.\n\nPresident Trump: Ted's opponent in this race is a stone cold phony named Robert Francis O'Rourke. Sometimes referred to as \"Bay\u2014to.\"\n\nActually, it's pronounced \"Beto,\" a nickname for Robert that he picked up in his hometown of El Paso. He's a three-term U.S. Congressman from the West Texas border. A former bass player in a punk band, O'Rourke has finally, at age 46, achieved rock star status.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: We are the defining immigrant story and experience. A border state that understands the bilateral relationship with Mexico.\n\nO'Rourke counts on the vote of Texas' millennials, minorities and urban professionals. He's spent months threading his way through Texas. While his small team livestreams everything, even the most mundane moments. When we met him in Waco recently, both his odometer and his voice were tapped.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: I don't know that there could be much more on the line than there is today. I don't know if the choices could be any more clear, the contrast any greater.\n\nJon Wertheim: Why do you think so many people, both inside Texas but beyond Texas, are so captivated by this race?\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: I think the way in which we are running it, without PACs, without special interests, without pollsters, without consultants, going to every county, all 254. At this really divided moment, everybody, knowing that they're invited to be part of this. And the fact that some of your stereotypes about what you think Texas is, aren't necessarily true.\n\nHe's right. The state's longtime slogan says it all: \"Texas - it's like a whole other country.\" But no more. Forget the image of Texas as this outsized outlier. Right now, it's actually a strikingly accurate reflection of the United States as a whole. Like America, the state is more diverse than ever. Four in ten Texans are Hispanic. And Cruz's hometown of Houston is set to overtake Chicago as the third largest American city after New York and L.A.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: Texas is growing like crazy. There's no state like Texas. I think we've got over 1,000 people a day moving to Texas.\n\nTexas may be carpeted with flatlands and prairies, but the open skies are being pierced with skyscrapers.\n\nLawrence Wright: Texas is an urban state. Three of the most populist, top-ten cities are in Texas. And number 11 is Austin.\n\nLawrence Wright is a longtime resident of Austin and the author of the book, \"God Save Texas.\" He characterizes the state in terms of two different radio frequencies.\n\nJon Wertheim: You've divided Texas into what you call AM Texas and FM Texas. Explain that.\n\nLawrence Wright: Well, I think AM Texas is what most people outside of Texas think the state is. AM Texas is you know, Rush Limbaugh.\n\nJon Wertheim: Social conservative. Care about their gun rights.\n\nLawrence Wright: Very much so. Evangelicals and so on. And yet, there's a side of Texas that many people don't really understand, and that's the FM Texas, which is more urban, progressive, more like other cities in the country.\n\nThe big question: which frequency will have the greater signal strength on Tuesday.\n\nLawrence Wright: I think that a lot of the Tea Party political figures in power right now see over the horizon. And what they see is a big change coming their way. And that change is brown. And that change is young. And that change is not so conservative. That's the wave that's coming into Texas.\n\nLike all the midterm races, the specter of Donald Trump hovers over the campaigns. In the case of Cruz, his newfound coziness with the president strikes many as hypocritical given how bitterly they opposed each other in the last presidential election.\n\nJon Wertheim: In 2016, you're running against President Trump and he disparages your father and your wife. You're accepting his support now. Reconcile that.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: Listen, 2016 was a hard-fought campaign. And there were hard blows thrown all around. Now, I could've said, you know, I've got hurt feelings. I don't like the things he said on the campaign. So I'm gonna take my marbles and go home. Frankly, I think that would've been a really selfish decision.\n\nJon Wertheim: Marbles implies this is schoolyard stuff. What he said about your father.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: At the end of the day, it's not about me. It's not about being selfish and worrying about my hurt feelings. And so, listen, I don't apologize for not being self-centered and pounding my foot and refusing to work with the president. I'm gonna do my job for the people of Texas.\n\nJon Wertheim: To what extent are you running against Ted Cruz? To what extent are you running against Donald Trump?\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: I'm not running against anyone. I really mean that. I wanna make sure that we are aware of the choice before us. Yep, it's walls, it's Muslim bans, it's \"the press is the enemy of the people.\" We know where that road takes us. We've seen that movie before. But given the stakes, if we're only organized against those things, then we demean our opportunity to define this country in the most positive, ambitious way possible.\n\nHere's an old Texas saying: \"there's nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\" In this case, both candidates are squarely in their lanes.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: He wants to abolish ICE; I want to abolish the IRS! [CHEERS]\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: What if we ended that war on drugs, ended the prohibition on marijuana. [CHEERS]\n\nLawrence Wright: Texans are gonna have a choice between a person who's seen as being too far right and another who's seen as being too far left. I think if Beto is elected you can then say Texas is no longer red, it's purple. If Texas is in play, if it's no longer the old reliable red that it's been for such a long time. Then the politics of the country are gonna change.\n\nRight now, the politics of the country are split in two, with Americans taking unyielding positions on climate change, guns, health care and immigration, a topic that has particular resonance in Texas, and may be the biggest divide between the candidates.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: Although I'll tell you, I've lived almost my entire life, 46 years on this planet in El Paso, one half of the largest binational community in the hemisphere, also happens to be one of, if not the safest cities in the United States of America. Not in spite of, but because we're a city of immigrants.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: He wants to make it no longer a crime to cross the border illegally. (BOOING) That would be the very definition of open borders.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: I just think that the politics of trying to scare you about me is a politics that all of us are sick of. He'll tell you that I want open borders. His mischaracterization, his dishonesty, his lies, he employs those tactics because in the past they've been shown to be effective.\n\nCruz has practiced traditional retail politics, and relies on his party's infrastructure, PAC money and traditional media. O'Rourke has kept his party's establishment at arm's length.\n\nJon Wertheim: We've noticed you haven't had a lotta the stars of the Democratic Party, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, former President Obama, they haven't come to Texas. Are you trying to distance yourself from the Party?\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: I'm not distancing myself. But I don't want anyone coming in from the outside. I want the people of Texas to decide this on, on their own terms.\n\nThis election may not come down to ideas, personalities, or even money, so much as who shows up. Early voting in Texas has shattered expectations, up more than 500 percent among young voters from the previous midterm.\n\nJon Wertheim: We keep hearing about the importance of turnout on election day for this election.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: Yes. If you look at the dynamics, we've got numbers on our side. There are a lot more conservatives than there are liberals. What the O'Rourke campaign has had on their side is intensity. The liberals who are in Texas are really, really mad. They hate President Trump. That anger is dangerous. I mean, that anger is mobilizing. It means they're gonna show up no matter what. As I've said, they'll crawl over broken-- broken glass to show up.\n\nJon Wertheim: That's not a good thing?\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: Look, intensity is, is always potent. Intensity turns people out at the polls.\n\nJon Wertheim: You working on the assumption that the more people that show up, the better your odds of winning?\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: Yeah, I think the more people that show up, the better we do.\n\nJon Wertheim: Why?\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: Because the people who are fired up right now are-- are fired up to do something great for this country. That's my sense. I don't have a pollster, so I-- I c-- I can't quantify this assumption for you. But the turnout that we're seeing-- is already off the charts.\n\nJon Wertheim: You mentioned no pollsters, no PAC money, and from the looks of it you're running this campaign out of the front seat of your minivan.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: Yeah.\n\nJon Wertheim: Is that a good idea?\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: Yeah, it's a great idea.\n\nJon Wertheim: Why's that?\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: It's fun. It's, it's the most direct way to connect with people. I love being on the road every day going to one community after the next. It's the only way to really get to know the state and the people that you wanna serve.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: When we decide that we're going to invest in people, great things happen ...\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: If you believe in low taxes, and low regulations, and lots of jobs, if you believe in defending the Constitution.\n\nJon Wertheim: You have two polished politicians, both in their 40s, ascending stars in their parties. Is there a sense, in Texas, the stakes are really high in this race?\n\nLawrence Wright: Yeah, because you know, we already had one who ran for president. And but for Donald Trump, might've gotten the nomination. And then we have one that's already being talked about as a future presidential contender without regard to whether he wins this race or not. They each have a core constituency that wants to be heard. That's something they have in common and it runs very deep.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz: If we lose our freedom here, where do we go? And so, look, I believed this when I was ten. I believed this when I was in college. I believe this now, that freedom works. Freedom matters.\n\nRep. Beto O'Rourke: This, this is gonna be a defining moment for us. I'm confident that people in the future will look back on 2018. They'll look back on this state specifically and say that Texas decided all.\n\nProduced by Graham Messick.

Bill Nelson, the three-time incumbent Democratic senator from Florida seeking his fourth term. At the moment, Nelson is the only Democrat holding statewide office in Florida. Should Gillum win, he will be Florida's first black governor.\n\nObama gently chastised a heckler for using profanity in front of children. The protester then started blowing a whistle and Obama addressed the individual again.\n\n\"If you support the other candidates, then you should support the other candidates,\" Obama said. \"Go to their rallies.\"\n\nPeriodically the crowd chanted to drown out the protester: \"Bring it home! Bring it home!\"\n\n\"Why is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time,\" Obama asked. \"When I won the presidency, at least my side felt pretty good.\"\n\nWe have seen rhetoric designed to divide us, the former president told the crowd. \"In four days, you can be a check on that kind of behavior,\" Obama said in a speech that embraced themes of inclusivity and social justice. You can choose a more generous vision of America, \"where love and hope conquer hate,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Gillum will expand Medicaid coverage, Obama said, and he promised Democrats \"won't let Republicans gut your health care.\"\n\nRight at election time, the former president said, Republicans have started to say they'll protect pre-existing conditions, when they've been doing the opposite.\n\n\"Let's call that what it is: it's a lie,\" Obama said.\n\nEarly voting in Florida is already on pace to surpass turnout in the last five midterm elections in the state. On Friday for the first time, over 4 million had voted early, with more Republicans than Democrats casting votes so far.\n\nElection Day will wrap up a bitter campaign season that witnessed the battle between DeSantis and Gillum veer into racial politics and heated exchanges over a long-simmering FBI investigation involving Gillum's home city.\n\nRight after the primary, DeSantis said Florida voters shouldn't \"monkey this up\" by electing Gillum, a comment Democrats contend was racially charged. President Trump also called Gillum a \"thief\" and corrupt, a move the mayor says is meant to reinforce negative stereotypes of black men.\n\nThe Gillum campaign, meanwhile, cut ties with a Democratic Party vendor and a campaign volunteer caught on video calling Florida a \"cracker\" state and saying the campaign was taking advantage of \"white guilt.\"\n\nThe Senate race between Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson has taken a back seat to the governor's race, but it too has centered largely on name-calling and insults lobbed in tens of millions of dollars' worth of negative television ads. Scott has painted Nelson as an ineffective career politician, while Nelson has labeled Scott untrustworthy because of questions about how the multimillionaire governor has handled his finances while in office.", "A survivor of last Saturday's Pittsburgh synagogue massacre says she doesn't believe the shooter should receive the death penalty because it'd be \"too easy.\"\n\n\"I want him to spend the rest of his miserable life rotting in jail,\" Carol Black told CBS News correspondent David Begnaud on Friday. \"He has no remorse and I think his only regret is that he didn't get us all.\"\n\nBlack survived the attack by hiding in a pitch-black storage closet with several others. Her brother, Richard Gottfried, was among the 11 people killed in the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in American history.\n\nGunman Robert Bowers was charged this week in a 44-count indictment that includes charges of murder, hate crimes, and obstructing the practice of religion. He pleaded not guilty. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said Sunday that federal prosecutors will seek approval to pursue the death penalty against Bowers.\n\n\"I think that's too easy, and I don't want him to have it easy,\" Black said.\n\nIn the interview with Begnaud, she described how the tragic day unfolded. Soon after arriving at the synagogue for services that morning, Black said she heard what sounded like a metal table falling against a tile floor. Initially, she assumed someone had just dropped something, but when the sound happened again, and this time closer, Rabbi Jeffery Myers ushered her and two others to a back hallway and into dark storage closet.\n\n\"I don't know how long we were in there,\" she said. \"It felt like a year, but it was probably closer to 20 minutes.\"\n\nDuring that time, Bowers was just feet away. The gunman came into the hallway to shoot 88-year-old Melvin Wax.\n\n\"It was pitch black in the area that we were in so he didn't see us and he didn't know we were there,\" Black said. \"I only saw his shadow.\"\n\nSoon after, SWAT team members flooded the Tree of Life synagogue, and Black was escorted to the back of a patrol car where she heard the the rest of the morning play out over the police radio.\n\n\"The intellectual part of me knew that [my brother] probably didn't make it because as they were taking me out of the building I kept saying, 'My brother's in there, you got to go get my brother,'\" Black said. \"But my heart kept saying that maybe he managed to escape.\n\n\"In reality, there was no place for them to go, he was trapped. They were sitting ducks and there was no way they were going to survive.\"\n\nBlack's brother, Richard Gottfried, was the \"heartbeat\" of the congregation, she said, and his death has been a \"crushing blow\" to the community.\n\nBy her estimates, nearly 1,500 people came to the funeral home to pay their respects to Gottfried on Thursday, \"a tribute to who he was and how many people from all the different areas of life loved him and miss him already.\"\n\nGottfried is survived by his wife, Louise. The couple had just celebrated their 38th wedding anniversary the prior weekend. The Gottfrieds were both dentists in the area and owned their own practice together. They had planned to retire in March, Black said.\n\nThe sounds of the gunfire initially stayed with Black, who said she lost sleep on Saturday night, unable to get the sounds out of her head. Since then, the sound of gunfire has been replaced with everything from Bon Jovi to hold-tone music, Black said.\n\n\"Talking about this, in a sense, is cathartic for me, it makes me feel more human and alive,\" she said. \"I'm glad to be alive.\"", "President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence joined forces at a rally in Indianapolis, Indiana, Friday evening, the first of two rallies Mr. Trump will attend in the battleground state before Election Day. Mr. Trump's Indianapolis rally was similar to his rally earlier in West Virginia, although he did not bring up his earlier theory that Republicans might lose the House of Representatives.\n\nThe campaign appearance supporting Indiana Republican candidates, particularly Senate candidate Mike Braun. Pence, the former governor of Indiana, has also been making a series of campaign appearances in recent days on behalf of Republican candidates around the country.\n\nThe president has largely focused on illegal immigration in the days before the election, a topic which could motivate Mr. Trump's base to turn out and vote in the midterms even though he is not on the ballot. This rally included familiar rhetoric about immigration, and particularly a migrant caravan en route to the U.S. from Central America that is weeks away from arriving at the border.\n\n\"The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan,\" Mr. Trump said, falsely, adding that Democrats want caravans \"full of illegal aliens to flood into our country.\" He also discussed how he believed the caravan will help motivate Republicans to turn out on election day. \"Between Justice Kavanaugh and the caravan, you people are energized,\" he said, referring to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who had been accused of sexual assault.\n\n\"A blue wave will equal a crime wave, and a red wave will equal law and safety,\" Mr. Trump said. Addressing a perceived weak spot of his -- Mr. Trump's approval among women -- he said that border security was a women's issue, because \"they want security.\" He also repeated the untrue claim that he won women in 2016. In fact, he won white women, but women overall voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Trump brought famed and beloved former head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers. He briefly led the crowd in a chant of \"Go get 'em, Donald!\"\n\nPence spoke before Mr. Trump, as sort of a warm-up act for the president, amping up the crowd by discussing administration accomplishments.\n\n\"I'm here today because I stand with President Trump,\" Pence said. \"We're here because President Trump and I stand shoulder to shoulder with the next great senator of Indiana, Mike Braun.\" He added that \"the time has come to vote 'no' on Joe,\" referring to Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly.\n\nMr. Trump also attacked Donnelly, resurrecting a moniker he had given the senator in earlier rallies: \"Sleepin' Joe.\" \"It's no surprise Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Obama,\" Mr. Trump said, writing out with his fingers Mr. Obama's middle initial, which stands for \"Hussein.\" Mr. Trump was the chief promoter of the birther conspiracy theory, which posited that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States.\n\nDonnelly one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election this year, and the result of the race could determine the partisan balance of the Senate. However, despite the fact that Mr. Trump won Indiana by nearly 20 points, Donnelly is for the most part maintaining a slim lead in the polls. A Wednesday Fox News poll found Donnelly leading Braun among likely voters 45 to 38 percent, with 5 percent supporting Libertarian Lucy Brenton. An NBC News/Marist poll also released Wednesday showed Donnelly leading Braun among likely voters 44 to 41 percent, with 8 percent supporting Brenton. However, a CBS News Battleground Tracker poll published Sunday found Braun leading Donnelly among likely voters 46 to 43 percent, and the CBS News Battleground Tracker rates the race as \"edge Republican.\"\n\nMr. Trump has escalated his campaign appearances and his incendiary rhetoric in the days leading to the midterms, rallying in states which he won in 2016. At a rally in Missouri on Thursday, Mr. Trump said that the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre suspect and the man accused of sending bombs in the mail to prominent Democratic figures managed to slow the political momentum of Republicans before the midterm elections.\n\n\"We did have two maniacs stop a momentum that was incredible, because for seven days nobody talked about the elections,\" he said. \"It stopped a tremendous momentum.\" He added, \"More importantly, we have to take care of our people, and we don't care about momentum when it comes to a disgrace like just happened to our country.\"\n\n\"But it did nevertheless stop a certain momentum, and now the momentum is picking up,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nIn addition to his usual claims that Democrats support \"open borders,\" the president has largely focused on his rhetoric on the caravan of migrants, most of whom are seeking asylum.\n\nAt a press conference regarding immigration on Thursday, Mr. Trump discussed the decision to send 15,000 military troops to the border. He said the military will not tolerate violence at the border, and any rocks thrown at the military will be treated like \"a firearm.\"\n\nWhen a reporter asked him about this, the president said he has told the U.S. military to \"consider it a rifle.\"\n\n\"We will consider that the maximum that we can consider that, because they're throwing rocks viciously and violently,\" he said. \"You saw that three days ago. Really hurting the military. We're not going to put up with that. If they want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We're going to consider -- and I told them, consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say, consider it a rifle.\"\n\nAt the rally on Thursday, Mr. Trump also criticized the Democrats on immigration, saying they \"are doing everything in their power to delay, to stop\" the wall from being built. \"And we need it more than ever,\" he added.\n\nMr. Trump also pushed his proposal to end birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. Mr. Trump called birthright citizenship a \"crazy, lunatic policy\" and vowed to end it, although it's unclear if that's possible.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV, Start a free trial", "An Air Force family in Panama City, Florida, made the most of Halloween \u2014 even though they had to go trick-or-treating among debris left over by Hurricane Michael. Heather D'Agostino Piddington didn't want the storm to ruin her kids' Halloween, so she got the whole community together to celebrate on Wednesday.\n\n\"The military made us evacuate and we just got back Sunday,\" Piddington told CBS News. Her husband is in the Air Force, stationed at Tyndall AFB, and she is a teacher at the elementary school on the base. \"While being away in Alabama in a hotel I reached out to my neighbors via our neighborhood Facebook page to see who was around and interested in still doing Halloween,\" Piddington said.\n\nDespite the neighborhood being wrecked by the powerful storm, community members were eager to get back to normal. \"Many replied that they wanted to make Halloween happen for the kids,\" the mother said.\n\nPiddington scheduled the trick-or-treating with other residents and took her daughters out around 5:30 p.m. The turnout was surprising. \"My daughters sure got a lot of candy! The trash didn't even phase them,\" she said. The mother snapped a picture of her 4-year-old daughter, Alivia, trick-or-treating in a witch costume on a street still strewn with debris, and it has gone viral.\n\nThis is what trick or treating looks like after a hurricane! **Thanks to our amazing neighbors who helped to pull this... Posted by Heather D'Agostino Piddington on Wednesday, October 31, 2018\n\nAs the the little girl walked down the street, she passed by mounds of trash and signs of destruction. Shingles lay on the sidewalk and garbage bags filled with ruined household items were piled up by the curb. But it was Halloween, and the kids didn't care what their neighborhood looked like, they just wanted one thing. \"Every time they saw someone in their driveway, they yelled, 'Candy!'\" Piddington told CBS News.\n\n\"Those that were there sat in their driveways close to the road so we could avoid all the debris on the sidewalks. It was amazing. Some even decorated their house and driveway. One even put orange lights all around their trash,\" Piddington said of her neighbors.\n\nHeather D'Agostino Piddington\n\nHurricane Michael hit the state on October 10 as the first Category 4 hurricane to make landfall in Florida's Panhandle since record-keeping began in 1851. The storm killed at least 16 people and left at least 1 million residents in Florida and Virginia without power.\n\nPiddington said they weren't allowed to return to the military base until October 28 because it was deemed too dangerous.\n\nThe family is grateful to be home, and thankful that their fellow community members came together to help kids celebrate Halloween.", "Among the rosy employment statistics in Friday's monthly hiring report, one especially shines: Worker wages in the U.S. are finally taking off.\n\nAverage hourly earnings in October grew 3.1 percent from ago, federal data show. That's the first time wage growth has crossed the 3 percent mark since April 2009, when the economy was reeling from the housing crash. Earnings for non-bosses (a category the Labor Department calls \"production and non-supervisory workers\" and excludes managers), grew even faster at 3.2 percent.\n\nThe big question: Will it last?\n\nAs economists often note, one month doesn't make a trend, and the government's monthly jobs numbers are volatile. Thanks to the hurricanes last month and at this same time last year, some of the wage growth could amount statistical noise, some experts think.\n\n\"Wage growth is getting faster, but annual growth is probably closer to 2.9 percent than 3.1 percent due to abnormally low wages last October (likely weather related),\" said Ben Zipperer, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, on Twitter.\n\nThe October wage figures are the latest in a string of positive data indicating that workers' paychecks are\u2014finally\u2014getting fatter. Separate Labor Department data released earlier this week showed that salaries in the third quarter were, on average, 2.9 percent higher than last year's.\n\nAt least in the short term, that trend should continue. PNC Bank predicts wage growth to average 3.3 percent next year, bringing it on par with 2007. Given that the number of job openings around the U.S. has exceeded the number of job-seekers since March, it's likely businesses will have to try work harder to attract employees, said PNC Senior Economist Bill Adams.\n\n\"A tight labor market causes employers to compete for the workers they want to attract and retain, and one way they compete is on salary,\" Adams said.\n\n\"It's been a very long and frustratingly slow recovery from the Great Recession, but it's improved every year since then, and we're finally in a situation where it's a good labor market for workers again.\"\n\nAnother factor boosting wages beyond the strong job market: Some of America's largest employers are upping what they pay. After sustained pressure from labor activists and lawmakers such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I.-Vermont, Amazon last month said it would raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour. That move affects some 350,000 full- and part-time workers. And in January, the minimum wage will increase in 18 states.\n\nIf employees are pleased with their higher paychecks, financial markets tend to get nervous when wages climb too much since they're believed to lead to inflation. Not all economists buy that theory.\n\n\"Businesses tend to pass on higher costs by raising the costs of the things that they sell. And if all businesses do that at the same time, that's inflation,\" Adams said.\n\nExcluding the price of food and gas, which tends to be volatile, inflation is rising at a rate of just over 2 percent this year after several years near zero.\n\nWhether higher paychecks will help Americans stay ahead of inflation or cause it to rise faster is a matter of debate. But one thing that could keep inflation contained even as wages rise is the dominance of large businesses in the U.S. economy. Businesses as big as Amazon often have margins that allow them to raise pay without blowing up prices, some economists say.\n\n\"Many large businesses will be able to absorb the higher costs without passing them on to the consumers,\" said Julia Pollak, a labor economist with ZipRecruiter. \"I don't think the wage growth will put a brake on economic growth. If anything it'll fuel consumption and further spur growth.\"", "Barbra Streisand may be an EGOT legend, but the \"Funny Girl\" star still gets stage fright. The singer, actress and director says that she still struggles with performing in front of an audience.\n\nStreisand joined James Corden on \"Carpool Karaoke\" on Thursday's \"Late Late Show\" and admitted that she's a nervous driver, but that didn't stop her from belting her hits.\n\nShe and Corden ran through Streisand's most iconic songs, including \"The Way We Were\" and \"Don't Rain on My Parade,\" and covers of classics like \"Imagine\" and \"What a Wonderful World.\" Streisand also sang her new song, \"Don't Lie to Me,\" a single off her new anti-Trump album, \"Walls.\" The song includes lyrics directed at President Trump with lines like, \"How do you win if we all lose? / You change the facts to justify / Your lips move but your words get in the way.\"\n\nThe singer talked about her 27-year hiatus from performing because of her stage fright.\n\n\"I don't get nervous nervous, but I don't enjoy it,\" she admitted. \"I get scared.

While most Americans will revel in the extra hour of sleep, for some people the shift can have a significant impact on health, and in particular their mood.\n\nFor those suffering from seasonal affective disorder (SAD), the shorter days and longer nights that come this time of year can exacerbate the condition.\n\nAbout half a million Americans suffer from SAD, while another 10 to 20 percent may suffer from a milder form of seasonal blues, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nWhile the cause of SAD is unknown, research has found some biological clues.\n\n\"The lack of light can impact our biological functioning,\" Louisa Sylvia, Ph.D., director of psychology at Massachusetts General Hospital Bipolar Clinic and Research Program, told CBS News. \"We're not making as much melatonin as usual, which helps with our hormone functioning and as a result it can lead to symptoms of depression such as fatigue, loss of interest in things, and lack of motivation, and it can snowball into a full-on depressive episode.\"\n\nSymptoms of SAD include feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day; low energy; losing interest in activities you once enjoyed; trouble sleeping; changes in appetite or weight; difficulty concentrating; and social withdrawal.\n\nWomen are diagnosed with SAD four times more often than men. Young adults and people with a family history of other types of depression are also more likely to experience it.\n\nIf you noticed an extreme dip in mood coinciding with the darker, colder days of winter, experts recommend visiting your doctor and asking for blood tests.\n\n\"Ask for vitamin D, B12 and iron levels, and get your thyroid levels checked,\" Dr. Vatsal Thakkar, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the NYU School of Medicine, told CBS News. \"If these are too low they may be bringing you down.\"\n\nTo cope with more run-of-the-mill winter blues, the American Psychological Association offers the following tips:\n\nExperience as much daylight as possible. The lack of exposure to the sun is a major catalyst for SAD, so getting out during the day as much as you can may help lessen symptoms. Go for walks throughout the day when possible. Even sitting by a window that lets in natural light can help.\n\n\n\nKeep active. Avoid staying cooped up in your house all winter. Spend time with family and friends, volunteer, or join a new activity or sport. Research shows that physical activity can help alleviate symptoms of SAD so make sure to fit some exercise into your daily routine. If it's too cold to exercise outside\n\n\n\nChoose your foods wisely. Though indulging in sugary treats and high-carb comfort food can be tempting \u2013 especially around the holidays \u2013 try to keep yourself in check. Numerous studies have shown that junk food can have a negative impact on mood, so steering clear can help with symptoms of SAD. Thakkar recommends incorporating more protein-rich and fatty foods to stabilize blood sugar and balance moods. \"With the darker nights and wintery weather, we can make a parallel to hibernation,\" he said. \"In order to hibernate, animals need higher blood sugar\n\n\n\nSeek professional help. If you continue to struggle with feelings of depression, you may want to consider seeing a mental health professional such as a psychologist. A professional can help determine if you are suffering from SAD and how to best help treat it.

Not only did Biles break a record at the 48th Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Doha, Qatar, she overcame several challenges \u2014 including her own high standards, The Associated Press reports.\n\nBiles made several mistakes during the competition but still managed to dominate. She slipped off the beam and stepped out of bounds on her floor exercise. She also sat down her vault in the first rotation. But what makes her historic win even more astounding is that Biles was battling kidney stones while competing.\n\nDespite her win, Biles was underwhelmed by her performance. \"It's not the gymnast that I am, to go out there and kind of bomb a meet like this,\" Biles said. \"Even though I won, I wish it were a little bit different.\"\n\nWhen you have more World gold medals than ANYONE EVER. #DohaGym2018 \ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47 pic.twitter.com/qUcf3sXrDA \u2014 USA Gymnastics (@USAGym) November 2, 2018\n\nLess than a week ago, the 21-year-old was hospitalized with kidney stones. \"This kidney stone has nothing on world championships,\" she wrote on Instagram, sharing a smiling selfie from her hospital bed.\n\nBiles thought about toning down the difficulty of her floor routine, the AP reports. But toning things down is simply not in her nature. \"I would never,\" Biles reportedly said. Her floor exercise is as hard as what men usually do, a degree of difficulty other women can't match.\n\nThe tenacious gymnast got an all-around score of 57.491, earning her a fourth world all-around title. \"I'm still disappointed in myself, because I know what I can do out there \u2014 despite the all-around, you know, winning gold. It doesn't show who I am,\" Biles said in an interview with USA Gymnastics after the meet.\n\nHer teammate, Morgan Hurd, was disappointed by the outcome. \"It's absolutely insane that she fell twice and won,\" Hurd said, according to the AP. \"I have no words.\" Biles beat Hurd by by more than 1.6 points.\n\n\"I guess it's good to be back on the podium, even with the falls. But it just sucks. It just sucks, man,\" Biles said. She called her team \"a strong group of girls.\"\n\nDespite Biles' mistakes during the meet, her coach, Laurent Landi, justified her win. \"She has (such) great ability that she needs to push it to the limit,\" Landi said. \"And when it goes very well, it's amazing. When it doesn't go well, it's still good enough.\"\n\nBiles and 17-year-old Hurd, who won bronze, were seen hugging after the tense competition. The teammates are competing in the finals today, where Biles hopes to \"redeem\" her problematic \u2014 yet winning \u2014 performance from Thursday.", "Sears says it is planning to spread holiday magic across its stores. Whether consumers will stop in and open their wallets between Black Friday and Christmas Eve remains the question.\n\nThe beleaguered retailer is facing several hurdles, which Peter Boutros, chief brand officer for Sears and Kmart, acknowledged in an interview with CBS MoneyWatch. Top among them is its bankruptcy filing last month, which may cause some consumers, vendors and even employees to be under the mistaken belief that the entire chain is closing, he said.\n\nSears on Thursday announced its Black Friday plans, which include opening at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving and closing at midnight. Stores will reopen on Friday, Nov. 23 at 5 a.m. To lure shoppers inside its doors, the company is offering Black Friday sales such as an $890 Kenmore French-door refrigerator at Sears, representing a 55 percent discount, and a $15 artificial tree at Kmart, down from its regular price of about $50.\n\nRetailing has grown more competitive than ever, with bricks-and-mortar stores battling fast-growing internet rivals such as Amazon. Years of underinvestment has left Sears in a rocky position as the holidays approach. Not only is it reassuring vendors and employees that it's still in business, but the retailer must convince shoppers to give it another chance -- just as healthier stores like Target and Walmart roll out their Black Friday specials.\n\n\"We have to leapfrog off many years when we weren't investing in the brand, to let people know that Sears and Kmart are relevant again,\" Boutros said. \"We need to reach out to customers and to get them to try us again.\"\n\nHe added, \"We do not have rose-colored glasses on.\"\n\nSince the bankruptcy, Sears has secured commitments from vendors to continue supplying its stores, which means shoppers will find well-stocked shelves over the holidays, he said. The company's decision to close 149 stores will allow Sears to \"redirect resources to the go-forward stores and the call center,\" he added.\n\n\"We're not on our heels -- we're on our toes going into the holidays,\" he said.\n\nStore challenges: Black Friday or bleak Friday?\n\nStores are getting refreshed with holiday signage. A visit to a Sears in South Burlington, Vermont last Thursday found a store without holiday signage, although some holiday merchandise, such as holiday socks and jewelry, were on display. Sears said the signage would be going up within days.\n\nThe store's stained carpets and scuffed walls signaled the location could use a bigger overhaul, although Boutros said the company isn't remodeling before the holidays because there isn't enough time.\n\nBlack Friday may prove a major test for whether it can compete with rivals with bigger pockets, such as Walmart and Amazon. Sears hasn't yet disclosed its Black Friday plans, yet it has said it plans a preview of its Black Friday \"doorbusters\" -- or products that are sold at a steep discount to lure consumers in the door -- for members on Nov. 18 from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nStill, consumers may expect more from their holiday shopping experience, noted Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData.\n\n\"The state of some of the stores makes Sears a totally uninspiring place to shop, which is not what consumers want during the holidays,\" Saunders said. \"Sears is going to have its work cut out if it intends to compete.\"\n\nSome consumers may also be unwilling to shop at Sears in light of the bankruptcy, Saunders said. First, some consumers may believe the store is already out of business because of the news of its bankruptcy. Secondly, they may worry about their ability to return items or whether Sears will still be around to honor warranties, he said.\n\n\"Some shoppers will be unwilling to buy products at Sears, especially big ticket products, for fear that they may not be able to return them or that guarantees won't be valid if the company eventually goes out of business,\" he noted.\n\nNostalgia boost?\n\nThe bankruptcy provoked an outpouring of nostalgia and support for Sears, with locations seeing \"a marked uptick in foot traffic and sales,\" Boutros noted. Sears started a campaign called \"Thanks for the love\" to acknowledge that support from shoppers.\n\n\"For us, that was our customers and members saying, 'We are going to stick with you,'\" he said.\n\nSears\n\nBut nostalgia may only go so far, Saunders cautions. \"To convert that to sales, Sears has to offer people things that they want at the right price and in an environment they want to shop in,\" he noted. \"There is no evidence that consumers buy out of sympathy for a troubled brand; if the ingredients of the retail offer are not right, sales won't be made.\"\n\nSears and Kmart's holiday plans include Kmart's Toy Book, which will be mailed or distributed in newspapers to 10 million households, and events such as its \"Unsung Heroes Event\" from Nov. 8-12, where veterans, teachers, police officers and other law enforcement and safety officials will receive an extra 10 percent discount. Kmart is also offering free photos with Santa Claus at every location on each Sunday between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nWith a strong economy and job market, more consumers will be feeling jolly this holiday season, pushing up holiday spending by 5 percent to $1,250 each, according to consulting company PwC. Whether Sears can ride that wave into a sales bump remains a big question, but doing so will be essential to its success, Saunders said.\n\n\"Given the strong economy and the fact that Sears' own same-store sales have been in decline for years, it is not unreasonable to expect some growth,\" he said. \"The second thing Sears needs to do is demonstrate operating profitability. This may be tough at the group level, but they need to show that at least some stores can make money.\"", "", "Born in Uruguay, Ignacio Mattos grew up eating local specialties but also the fresh pastas made by his Italian grandmother, who was his first food major influence. Later came other mentors including the legendary Alice Waters at California's Chez Panisse.\n\nMattos eventually moved to New York and in 2013 opened Estela, named one of Bon Appetit's best new restaurants and later two other venues, which led Esquire magazine to name him chef of the year. Mattos just released his debut cookbook, \"Estela.\"\n\nHere are some of Mattos' signature recipes:\n\nLamb ribs with \"chermoula\" and honey\n\nBrine ingredients\n\n10 cups hot water\n\n1 cup (225 g) kosher salt\n\n1\u00bd teaspoons pink curing salt\n\n5 pounds (2.25 kg) Denver-cut lamb spareribs\n\n(cut from the breast)\n\nFor the Spice Mixture\n\n\u2153 cup (25 g) coriander seeds\n\n\u2153 cup (37 g) fennel seeds\n\n2 tablespoons cumin seeds\n\n1 tablespoon black peppercorns\n\n1 clove\n\nHeaping 1 tablespoon chile flakes\n\n\u00bd teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\nChermoula ingredients\n\n2 bunches cilantro, roughly chopped\n\nKosher salt\n\n2 teaspoons sherry vinegar\n\n1 teaspoon fish sauce\n\n1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil\n\n3 tablespoons honey\n\n3 tablespoons chardonnay vinegar\n\nA handful of mint leaves, torn, for garnish\n\nDirections\n\n1. Brine the ribs: Pour the hot water into a container large enough to hold the lamb ribs and add the kosher and pink salts, stirring to dissolve them. Let cool, then add the ribs, cover, and refrigerate overnight, ideally for 15 to 17 hours.\n\n2. The next day, make the spice mixture: Coarsely grind each spice separately using a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder. (This takes a little extra time, but grinding them together makes for an uneven, too-fine mixture.)\n\n3. Take the ribs out of the brine, pat dry, and arrange them on a baking sheet so the inner side is facing up. Press on a light layer of the spice mixture. Flip them and press and pat the rest of the spice mixture onto the top of the ribs-you really want to get a good crust on there, so much that you can't really see the meat anymore. Return the ribs to the refrigerator for 12 more hours so the meat has time to take on the flavor of the spice mixture.\n\n4. When you're ready to cook, preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Place a wire rack on a baking sheet and pour \u00bd cup (about 120 ml) water into the bottom of the baking sheet to keep the ribs from drying out. Place the ribs on the rack, then cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, crimping the edges to keep the steam from escaping. (You don't want too much contact between the ribs and the foil, but a little is okay.) Slide the ribs into the oven.\n\n5. Check the ribs after 2\u00bd hours: When they are ready, the bones at the ends of the slabs will be a little wiggly, so that you could pull them out easily. If you need to, give them another 15 minutes or so. Remove the pan from the oven, being careful that the water doesn't spill. Uncover the ribs-be careful of the hot escaping steam-and let them cool, then cut between the bones into 2-rib sections. (The ribs can sit in the refrigerator overnight, if you like. In fact, this will make them easier to cut.)r.\n\n6. When you're ready to serve, arrange the ribs on a baking sheet, meat side up; bring to room temperature if you've refrigerated them. Preheat the broiler.\n\n7. Make the chermoula: Put the cilantro in a large mortar, add a pinch of salt, and pound lightly with the pestle. Mix in the sherry vinegar, fish sauce, and olive oil.\n\n8. Mix together the honey and chardonnay vinegar, then brush or spoon about half the mixture over the ribs and place under the broiler for 3 minutes. Lacquer on the remaining honey mixture, then place the ribs back under the broiler for another 3 minutes or so. You're just looking to add some toasty color and heat the ribs fully; you don't want to cook the meat any further. And yet, you may need to give them a bit more time.\n\n9. To serve, place a spoonful of chermoula on each plate, top with mint leaves, then set as many ribs as you like on top.\n\nScallops with peas, lardo, and collard greens\n\nIngredients\n\n\n\n6 large scallops (see Note), patted dry\n\nKosher salt\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil\n\n\u00bd cup (about 100 g) cubed (\u00bc-inch) lardo\n\n2 tablespoons lard\n\n1 cup shelled fresh peas (see Note)\n\n3 collard leaves, torn into roughly 2 by 3-inch pieces\n\n\u00bd lemon\n\nDirections\n\n1. Practical Notes: We use U-10 scallops here; the size designation means there are only 10 of these large scallops per pound. Just grab the biggest ones you can find. Get the freshest and most tender peas possible.\n\n2. Heat a large carbon-steel or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Salt both sides of the scallops, then place them in the dry pan, pressing down on them with a spatula so they develop a good crust. Cook for 2 minutes, or until browned on the first side, then add a thin spill of olive oil, carefully flip the scallops, and cook for 20 to 30 seconds on the other side; the scallops should be just barely cooked through. Transfer to a plate.\n\n3. Warm the lardo and lard (one is cured, the other is not) in a small saucepan over medium-low heat for about 30 seconds, until the lardo begins to turn translucent and the edges soften. Add the peas and a splash of water to help them cook and cook just until the peas are bright green, about 2 minutes. Add the collard leaves and cook until they wilt, then season with a pinch of salt and remove from the heat.\n\n4. Remove the collard leaves from the peas and place a spoonful of the peas and lardo on each of four plates. Top with the scallops, season with a squeeze of lemon juice, then top with the collards and serve.\n\nSteak with brussels sprouts and taleggio\n\n\n\nIngredients\n\n2 pounds (900 g) hanger steak, tough sinew removed, cut into 4 portions\n\n(ask your butcher to do this)\n\nKosher salt\n\n\u00bc cup (60 ml) fish sauce\n\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n\n2 tablespoons minced rosemary\n\nAbout 20 Brussels sprouts\n\nGrated zest of 1 lemon\n\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\n\u00be cup (180 ml) Taleggio Sauce (page 37)\n\nAbout 1\u00bd tablespoons Marjoram-Anchovy Salsa Verde (page 42)\n\nCoarse grinds of black pepper\n\nDirections\n\n1. Let your steak come to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Coat all the pieces of steak with a generous layer of salt on all sides, really patting it into the flesh. Let sit for another 30 minutes. It may look as if it's beginning to dry out, and that's a good thing; it means you'll get a better sear.\n\n2. Meanwhile, mix together the fish sauce, garlic, and rosemary in a small bowl. Trim the bottoms of the Brussels sprouts. Steam them until they are bright green and retain just a bit of crunch, 10 to 12 minutes, depending on their size. Let cool a bit, then quarter if large and toss them in a bowl with \u00bd teaspoon salt and the lemon zest. Set aside.\n\n3. When you're ready to cook the steak, heat a large carbon-steel or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes.\n\n4. Add the olive oil to the pan, then add the steaks, gently pressing them down to get even contact and a good sear, and let cook for 2 minutes. (You'll have to do this in two batches if your pan isn't big enough; or use two pans.) Lacquer each piece with two or three brushes of the fish sauce mixture, then flip. Cook on the second side for 2 minutes, then lacquer with more fish sauce and flip again. After a minute, lacquer with more fish sauce and flip. Cook for another minute, brush again, and flip. If you have an instant-read thermometer, use it to test your steaks' internal temperature; it should be about 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C). If you don't have a thermometer, a cake tester inserted into the interior of the steak for 10 seconds should come out warm. When the steaks are done, let them rest for 5 minutes, ideally propped up on something-like chopsticks laid over a plate-to keep the bottoms from steaming. Set the pan aside.\n\n5. While the steaks rest, gently warm the Taleggio sauce. Just before serving, heat the same skillet over medium heat and lightly sear your steaks again to warm them up, about 30 seconds on each side. Remove from the pan and slice each steak horizontally.\n\nTaleggio sauce ingredients\n\n8 ounces (about 225 g) Taleggio, cold\n\n\u00bd cup (120 ml) heavy cream,\n\nplus more if needed\n\nKosher salt\n\nDirections\n\n1. Remove the rind from the Taleggio. Cut the cheese into \u00bd-inch cubes and place them in a heatproof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it just begins to simmer, then pour it over the cheese and immediately cover the bowl with plastic wrap. As you need a good seal to trap the heat so the cheese melts, it's actually best to wrap the plastic around the bowl a few times. Let stand for 20 minutes.\n\n2. Remove the plastic wrap and, using an immersion blender, blend the cheese and cream until smooth. Taste and add salt. If the sauce seems too thick, add an additional tablespoon or so of hot cream. You want it to be loose enough that you can spread it onto a plate without it clumping.\n\n3. You can make this a few days ahead of time and refrigerate it. To reheat it, bring to room temperature first, then place the container in a bowl of hot tap water and stir occasionally until the sauce warms and softens; a bain-marie would be the best way of doing this. You may need to add more hot cream.\n\nAsparagus with \"b\u00e9arnaise\" and wild salmon bottarga\n\nIngredients\n\n20 medium-slim asparagus stalks\n\nKosher salt\n\n1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil\n\n2 generous tablespoons b\u00e9arnaise (recipe follows)\n\nAbout 1 ounce (30 g) wild salmon or any other type of bottarga or mojama for grating\n\nDirections\n\n1.Preheat the broiler. Prep the asparagus by snapping off the woody ends and trimming off their tips-save the tips for a salad or saut\u00e9ing. Rinse the stalks to wash off any grit, then halve them lengthwise, if large, and cut into 2-inch lengths.\n\n2. Put the asparagus on a baking sheet and toss with a pinch of salt, and then with a few drops of water and the olive oil. Broil for 2 minutes, or until the asparagus has a bit of color and is beginning to get tender but is not soft all the way through.\n\n3. Put a ring mold on a plate and spread half the b\u00e9arnaise evenly in it, then scatter and layer half the asparagus over it. Using a regular Microplane, shave an even layer of bottarga or mojama over the asparagus-you want enough that you can taste it but not so much that you can't see the asparagus. Lift off the ring mold and repeat on a second plate with the remaining ingredients. Serve.\n\nB\u00e9arnaise ingredients\n\n\u00bd medium shallot, minced\n\n2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil\n\nKosher salt\n\n\u00bd cup (120 ml) dry vermouth\n\n\u00bd cup (120 ml) white wine\n\n2 large egg yolks\n\n\u00bd pound (2 sticks; 225 g) unsalted butter, melted and still warm\n\n\u00bc teaspoon chardonnay vinegar\n\nDirections\n\n1.Combine the shallot and olive oil in a small saucepan, add a pinch of salt, and sweat the shallot over medium-low heat until soft but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the vermouth and wine, increase the heat to medium, and simmer until you have \u00bc cup (60 ml) of liquid, 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer set over a liquid measuring cup and discard the shallot.\n\n2. Put the egg yolks in a plastic quart container or other tall, narrow vessel and blend with an immersion blender. With the blender running, slowly stream in the melted butter a few tablespoons at a time, blending thoroughly after each addition before adding the next, until the mixture is completely emulsified. Stream in the reduced wine mixture, blending until fully incorporated. Add the vinegar and a pinch of salt, or to taste; you want the b\u00e9arnaise to be bright, with the vinegar providing a nice balance against the fat.\n\n3. Use as soon as possible, since it can't be reheated; if necessary, keep warm in a bain-marie.\n\n\n\n", "PARKLAND, Fla. \u2013 Fenway Park is 1,200 miles from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. But a new billboard near the iconic Boston ballpark carries a powerful message of gun control inspired by the violence that unfolded at the Florida high school.\n\nJoaquin Oliver lost his life in the Parkland shooting. Now, his image and his family's demand for gun control in the wake of his death looms large on the massive billboard, CBS Miami reports.\n\nIt reads, \"If I had attended high school in Massachusetts instead of Parkland Florida, I would likely be alive today.\"\n\nMassachusetts bans the type of assault rifle that was used to murder 17 students, teachers and staff in the Florida high school shooting.

Ambassador and former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley at the end of the year. The president has told White House advisers that he continues to be impressed by Nauert, a former Fox News host before joining the State Department. The president met with Nauert this week in the Oval Office, and may formally offer her the position as early as next week. CBS News had previously reported that Nauert was under consideration for the role.\n\n\"She's under very serious consideration,\" Mr. Trump told reporters before departing for rally in Missouri on Thursday.\n\n\"She's excellent. She's been with us a long time. She's been a supporter for a long time. And she's really excellent,\" the president added.\n\nA top White House official reiterated to CBS News earlier this week that she is \"under strong consideration.\"\n\nWhite House sources, however, caution that nothing is set in stone until it is officially announced by the president. Among the other top contenders being considered were U.S. Ambassador to France Jamie McCourt and U.S. Ambassador to Canada Kelly Knight Craft.\n\nNauert does not have lengthy diplomatic experience. She was previously a news reader for the Fox News morning broadcast \"Fox and Friends\" and was also a former ABC News correspondent. Nauert graduated from Columbia University with a master's degree in journalism, and Ivy league credentials have always impressed the president.\n\nNauert has long been a favorite of Mr. Trump and many in his inner circle. She was selected directly by the White House, not by then-Secretary of State Tillerson, for her current role at the State Department.\n\nNauert has expressed interest in the job because it would bring her closer to her family in New York City, according to sources. This week, Nauert handed all the briefings at State off to her deputy, indicating that she is putting her time and energy in other places right now. Sources familiar with the discussions believe that Mr. Trump wanted to make the announcement before the midterm election next Tuesday.", "Cop-killing illegal immigrant Luis Bracamontes stars in a web video from January that President Trump tweeted Thursday. The expletive-laced courtroom footage shows a laughing Bracamontes admitting he killed two police officers and promising to break out of jail soon.\n\n\"Democrats let him into the country,\" the video says in all caps. As he says he wishes he had \"killed more\" cops, \"Democrats let him stay\" flashes over the screen. Neither the video nor the president cite any evidence to support the allegation that Democrats let him into the U.S. and let him stay.\n\nIs the accusation accurate?\n\nTHE FACTS: No. This is akin to blaming Republicans for criminals who entered the country illegally under Presidents Trump or George W. Bush.\n\nBracamontes, who is from the Mexican state of Sinaloa, came to the U.S. illegally in June 1996, during Democrat Bill Clinton's administration. He was arrested three months later on drug charges after purchasing crack cocaine from an undercover officer at a Phoenix apartment. According to The Sacramento Bee, after he served his four-month term in then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio's tent city jail, he was handed off to immigration agents and deported in June 1997.\n\nThe Bee cited Arizona records that showed he crossed the border again and was arrested on drug charges again in Phoenix in 1998 before being released \"for reasons unknown\" by Arpaio's office. Arpaio, a Republican and ardent Trump supporter, ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2018.\n\nThen in March 2001, Bracamontes was arrested for marijuana possession in Arizona in March 2001, during the Bush administration. It's unclear when he returned to the U.S. illegally before that arrest.\n\nBracamontes was deported four times before he killed Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver and Placer County sheriff's Detective Michael Davis Jr., according to Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones.\n\nThere is no evidence that any Democrat \u2014 or anyone, for that matter \u2014 allowed Bracamontes to stay.\n\nDemocratic and Republican administrations alike have deported hundreds of thousands of people a year. Barack Obama focused during his second term on recent arrivals and people with criminal histories, but Mr. Trump quickly directed that anyone in the country illegally could be targeted.", "Although midterm elections have historically seen low voter turnout, early voting totals in 27 states have exceeded total early votes in the 2014 midterm election, according to data from the University of Florida Elections Project. This may suggest higher voter turnout overall in the 2018 midterm elections\n\nUniversity of Florida associate professor Michael McDonald, who oversees the Election Project, told \"Red & Blue\" on CBSN Thursday that the early vote totals could indicate 45 to 50 percent turnout by eligible voters on election day.\n\n\"In the last three decades, we've had about 40 percent of those eligible to vote participating in midterm elections. If we get in the upper end of that range, if we can beat the 1966 49-percent turnout rate, you'd have to go all the way back to 1914 to get a turnout rate above 50 percent,\" McDonald said.\n\nA number of states that have seen higher than normal early voting turnout -- including Arizona, Nevada, Indiana, Missouri, and North Dakota -- have critical elections that could determine the balance of power in the Senate. In Texas, which is home to another crucial Senate race, the early voting total has surpassed the total 2014 vote, including early voting and election day.\n\nFlorida and Georgia, two more states with early voting turnout higher than in 2014, have close gubernatorial races as well, each with strong Trump-supporting Republican candidates facing progressive African-American Democrats. Both races have the potential to be history-making: Andrew Gillum of Florida could be the third black man elected governor, and Stacey Abrams of Georgia could be the first black woman elected governor in the country.\n\nSeveral of these states have been accused of encouraging voter suppression, particularly for minorities. In Georgia, 53,000 voting applications have been suspended, with 70 percent of those belonging to black voters. In North Dakota, a restrictive voter ID law which primarily affects Native Americans has been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nMcDonald noted that even states without \"marquee\" elections in the Senate and for governor were seeing high early voter turnout, with Democrats having an edge. In states which have those close races, \"everyone is voting,\" meaning that one party does not necessarily have an advantage.\n\nHigh-profile political figures have been visiting several states with close races. In the final week before the election, President Trump is rallying for Republican candidates in Florida, Missouri, West Virginia, Indiana, Montana, Georgia, Tennessee, and Ohio. Former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden are also visiting several of these states to rally for Democrats in the run-up to election day.", "The same day that Lisa Borders assumed her role as the first president and CEO of Time's Up, thousands of Google employees walked out of work to protest revelations in The New York Times that the tech giant had protected three executives accused of sexual misconduct and paid large severances to two of them.\n\nBorders told \"CBS This Morning\" that Thursday's walkout was like the universe affirming her decision to join Time's Up, an organization dedicated to \"creating safe, fair and dignified work for women of all kind.\" Global outrage over the treatment of women in the workplace and beyond sparked the #MeToo movement last year and led to the creation of Time's Up.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Google CEO Sundar Pichai addressed his employees' complaints, saying, \"Moments like this show that we didn't always get it right, so we have committed to do things better.\" The company said it supported the protest and acknowledged that in the past two years, 48 workers have been fired over sexual misconduct claims, but it said none received payments.\n\nBorders, who previously served as the president of the WNBA, applauded Google for admitting the problem but says the next phase for the company is to actually respond, not react, to the issues raised by the protesters, who left letters on their desks explicitly outlining their complaints.\n\n\"When I thought about the Google team, if you will, the Google family, they left notes on their desk as to where they were going, what they were doing, why they were protesting\u2026. It was crisp, it was compelling and it was clear,\" Borders said. \"The question now is will the CEO and the board and the Google team take them seriously and respond?\"\n\nThe protester's goals include an end to forced arbitration in discrimination and harassment cases; a commitment to pay transparency and equity; disclosure of harassment reports and consistency in misconduct reporting.\n\nBorders said transparency is key to making diversity a priority at companies, but more importantly, it is just good for business.\n\n\"The diversity data that says when you have people of different backgrounds, experiences, skill sets and talents working on any problem or anything that your company is working on, the results are better. This is not Lisa's opinion \u2014 if you look at the price earnings ratios in public companies, the return on investment, the data is clear. These companies have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. I'm not going to make the moral argument, may we start with the economic argument.\"\n\nThough some prominent men who were ousted for misconduct in the #MeToo era have started making attempts to return to public life, we still haven't fully answered the question of what \"redemption\" looks like or how one qualifies for it. Borders says there is in fact room for redemption.\n\n\"Once you have walked through saying you're sorry\u2026 then you talk about what you're going to do to fix it and then how are you going to take full accountability. You need to be brought into the fold. You can be the best ally if you have done some wrong and you are now walking in the light and see a better way and going to perform a better way, you are in fact redeemed.\"", "", "Scientists have discovered an underwater chain of volcanoes off the coast of Tasmania.

The presidents include Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson \u2013 all of whom made efforts to unite the country in tough times.\n\n\"I think Lincoln was born with it. Even as a little kid he hated when his fellow friends would put hot coals on turtles to make them wriggle. He went and said, 'That's wrong. You're causing pain.' I think LBJ in some ways, because he was born in that poverty circumstances, had it. But the other two privileged guys had to develop it over time,\" Kearns Goodwin said.\n\nThe author also discussed FDR's famous fireside chats, a series of evening radio addresses the president would offer to the nation. They were a \"direct connection\" to the people. But asked whether those fireside chats could be compared to President Trump's tweets, Kearns Goodwin said there's a difference.\n\n\"The fireside chats took place over maybe 45 minutes or an hour. They explained problems to the people. He was speaking directly to each individual,\" she said. But the tweets \"come extemporaneously,\" she said.\n\n\"They're not as prepared. Roosevelt used to spend weeks preparing each one of those fireside chats. He didn't want to say something that would hurt, not the right word. He went over them five or six times because he knew a president has a dignity, has a moment to speak to the people and it has to be right,\" Kearns Goodwin said.\n\nWith so much divisiveness in the political and cultural landscape in America today, Kearns Goodwin reminded the public \"we've seen worse\" and history can help provide perspective.\n\n\"Just imagine what it was like for Abraham Lincoln. He comes into office, the country's already split in two. More than 600,000 people are about to die [in the Civil War]. He later said if you ever imagined how anxious it would be, he couldn't have thought he lived through it,\" Kearns Goodwin said. \"Even Teddy Roosevelt when he comes in after the assassination of McKinley, the country is split apart worse than it is now by the Industrial Revolution. The working class feels absolutely split off from the capitalists. There's immigrants coming in from abroad. There's a gap between the rich and the poor.

He is currently serving a ten year sentence in Tehran's Evin Prison.\n\n82-year-old Baquer Namazi was in Evin too, but became so sick that was he was released. He is now critically ill under house arrest.\n\nHis son, Siamak, a businessman, is also serving a ten year sentence in Evin.\n\n\"There has to be a private dialogue between both governments to find a humanitarian basis\u2026 a way to do some kind of prisoner swap, which is historically been what has happened in the past,\" Jared Genser, a Washington-based lawyer for the Namazis, told CBS News.\n\nIran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said he was pushing for a so-called humanitarian agreement and hinted at a prisoner swap, Palmer reports, though she says no one expects progress anytime soon.\n\nBut Iran hasn't responded to the impending harsh U.S. sanctions with the blistering rhetoric it has used in the past. Instead, Palmer says, it's pointing out that Iran has stuck to the nuclear agreement and claiming America's sanctions amount to bullying.", "", "Democrats on the ballot have one last chance to make their closing arguments to voters in this last weekend before Election Day. In a political season that has been more geared toward national concerns than in previous elections, the campaigns have been bitter and partisan, and the challenge for Democrats is to break through -- especially with the onslaught of both legitimate crises and 11th hour political stunts from a White House anxious to shift the momentum.\n\nAt this late stage, it's no longer about persuading people on the fence. Campaigns should be focused on getting the converted to their polling places. For Democrats, the message is simple: We are better than this.\n\nPresident Trump is doing everything he can to try to control the news cycles he has dominated since he stepped into the political spotlight, floating half-baked trial balloons like ending birthright citizenship, claiming he'll advance a middle class tax cut, and sending thousands of troops to the border to whip up his base, which is already terrified by his false characterizations of a caravan of asylum seekers who won't be reaching the U.S. border for weeks.\n\nHis latest volley \u2013 a racist video of a convicted cop killer who happens to be an undocumented immigrant \u2013 makes it clear where he's driving the discussion in these final days of the campaign.\n\nAll of this could actually help Democrats.\n\nFrustration with the president might push sporadic voters who don't typically wade into midterm elections to head to the polls and sway independents and moderates. Early vote numbers indicate turnout is already higher than previous cycles \u2014 40 percent of ballots had already been cast as of Halloween morning. In key states like Georgia, Florida, Nevada, Michigan, and Texas, numbers are up significantly, including among young voters, which could be good news for Democrats like Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke looking for upset victories.\n\nSo what should Democrats focus on in these final days?\n\nLocal matters\n\nIt would be a mistake for any Democrats to make their final pitch to voters exclusively about Trump. Even in this hyper-national landscape, Democrats can't forget that local elections require a local frame \u2013 and voters need to believe a candidate understands their needs and has a vision for making their lives better. Voters are still worried about how they're going to pay the bills, what kind of education their children will have, and whether they can afford to visit the doctor.\n\nThis election is a broader referendum on Republicans, who hold both houses of Congress, the White House, and the overwhelming majority of governor's mansions nationwide. Republicans campaigned in 2016 on repealing Obamacare, but their efforts failed because they couldn't answer the question, \"Then what?\" A jittery public worried about losing health care coverage ultimately doomed the repeal effort in the Senate. Yet Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is still thinking about trying again to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cutting back on Medicare and Medicaid to help pay for the ballooning deficit caused by the Trump tax cuts.\n\nDemocrats should be pounding home the message that they're the ones who will protect health care coverage for Americans and pushing back on disingenuous claims by Republicans that they'll protect people with pre-existing conditions. The latest CBS News polling illustrates this point. In Florida, Arizona, and Indiana, where the U.S. Senate races remain hotly contested, voters say health care tops their concerns, and protections for pre-existing conditions are a specific factor in determining which party they'll support. Voters want to know they're not one illness away from bankruptcy.\n\nDon't boo -- vote\n\nWe'll see if Democrats are able to translate the rage and anxiety in our communities into voters. Women in the suburbs, in particular, are expected to be a decisive voting bloc in dozens of congressional, Senate, and other statewide races. The #MeToo movement is likely to motivate large swaths of women to head to the ballot box.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats can speak to the broader phenomenon increasingly described as a kind of \"Trump Anxiety Disorder.\" Effective democracy requires faith in our institutions, experienced leadership, and a steady hand in both peace and in crisis. In the era of Trump, we have none of these. Americans have seen the most contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings in decades, a White House and Cabinet that's constantly turning over, and a president who stokes fears, snubs traditional U.S. allies while embracing strongmen, and peddles falsehoods daily. It's no surprise that they want a check on Donald Trump \u2013 in some surveys by as much as a 2 to 1 margin.\n\nMost important, Democrats must convince the so-called Obama coalition to go to the polls. Former President Obama's call to action, \"Don't boo, vote\" has never applied more. Remind young people their voice matters and arm them with the information to make smart choices. Remind the communities of color that often sit out off-year elections that they should be using their power to affect the outcome of these elections.\n\nTime is short. Get-out-the-vote weekend starts now, and early voting continues in 37 states around the country.", "What's left of Toys R Us is returning for the holidays, with Geoffrey's Toy Box setting up shop this month in about 600 Kroger stores in nearly 30 states, the nation's largest supermarket chain said Friday.\n\nThe grocery chain is the latest retailer to make a play for former Toys R Us shoppers. Walmart and Target are expanding their toy sections, and Amazon is sending physical toy catalogs to customers.\n\nThe move at Kroger's is not entirely a surprise, given the bankrupt retailer's mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe, in April made an unexpected -- and for some unwelcome -- appearance at a toy industry trade show, seemingly sent by a group of lenders that controls the bankrupt retailer's intellectual property and is planning a second act.\n\nA company called Geoffrey LLC was formed last month after the funds that took control of the retailer's assets reversed plans on auctioning off its intellectual property, opting to try to resuscitate the brand instead. The venture's Geoffrey's Toy Box sections at Kroger supermarkets will sell toys from some of Toys R Us' former private labels, including Zone, Imaginarium, Journey Girls, Edu Science, You & Me, and Just Like Home, ranging in price from $19.99 to $49.99.\n\nHand-out\n\nThe Kroger's move is part of an effort by financial firms Solus Alternative Asset Management and Angelo Gordon to raise capital to revive Toys R Us as a stand-alone outfit, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n\"We're excited to offer Geoffrey's Toy Box this holiday season to provide our customers with the opportunity to purchase a selection of toys once exclusive to Toys R Us,\" Robert Clark, Kroger's senior vice president of merchandising, stated in a news release.\n\n\"We are thrilled to partner with Kroger to bring a curated collection of product from our beloved portfolio of brands to American consumers this holiday,\" added Richard Barry, executive vice president of Geoffrey's Toy Box and formerly chief merchandising officer at Toys R Us.\n\nThe news is not sitting well with the 33,000 Toys R Us workers laid off without severance, said Carrie Gleason, policy director for Organization United For Respect, or OUR, an advocacy group pressing the financial firms behind the decision to liquidate Toys R Us to contribute to a fund for affected employees.\n\n\"It's shocking that Solus and Angelo Gordon would launch Geoffrey's Toy Box without first doing right by the 33,000 families that have been struggling since these hedge funds shut down the stores,\" said Gleason, whose group is leading discussions with those funds to contribute to a fund to help the displaced workers\n\n\"I'm bitter sweet,\" Ann Marie Reinhart, a 29-year Toys R Us veteran, told CBS MoneyWatch. As a grandmother, Reinhart said she was \"happy they are opening something for children\" in Kroger stores, recalling how she loved watching little kids walk into her own Toys R Us store for the first time.\n\nA store supervisor in Durham, North Carolina, when she lost her job in April, Reinhart received a few weeks of unemployment, no longer has health insurance, and is looking for a job at 59. \"We feel like we helped build this brand,\" she said, adding that the decision to retreat from the company's previous policy of paying severance left workers feeling betrayed.\n\nEarlier this month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, requested financial companies including Angelo Gordon, Franklin Mutual Advisors, Highland Capital, Oaktree Capital, Solus and Vornado Realty Trust to explain why they pushed to liquidate the toy seller rather than reorganize under bankruptcy protection.\n\nPrivate equity investors KKR and Bain Capital are working to create a fund to support Toys R Us workers impacted by the retailer's demise, Gleason said. As for the other investors: \"Hundreds of former Toys R Us employees have reached out to these hedge funds and asked them to contribute to the fund, and they have refused,\" she said.\n\nThe devastation from the retailer's demise extends beyond the tens of thousands of laid-off workers, Gleason said, citing the negative impact on business for toymakers, including Mattel, Lego and Hasbro, which recently announced layoffs. \"We're losing manufacturing jobs from this mess,\" she said.\n\nA spokesperson for Angelo Gordon declined comment, while Solus referred requests for comment to an agency representing Toys R Us, which did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nReached for comment, none of the other six financial firms involved replied.\n\n-- The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "HOLLISTER, Calif. -- A swarm of earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault, the largest measuring a 4.1 magnitude, rumbled through the Hollister area and the Salinas Valley Friday morning. CBS San Francisco, citing officials, reports the quakes rattled nerves but caused no major damage.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey, the 4.1 quake hit at 5:58 a.m. PDT 12 miles southwest of the small community of Tres Pinos. It was followed by quakes measuring 3.6, 3.2 and 3.0.\n\nThe USGS said the quakes were most strongly felt in nearby Hollister followed by Salinas, Gonzales, Monterey, Carmel Valley and Santa Cruz.\n\nAuthorities did not report any damage.\n\nMatzuma Li, who lives in the Central Valley took to Twitter, saying the jolt awoke she and her cats.\n\n\"Nice way to start the day\u2026 A pleasant 4.0 to shake the cats through the roof at 6am,\" she tweeted.", "", "The social media accounts associated with Sen. Joe Manchin's office have been hacked, his office announced Thursday.\n\nA statement from his office said he was notified of the hack on Thursday, and the accounts have since been secured. The West Virginia Democrat and his staff are working with state and federal law enforcement to prevent further hacks, his office said.\n\nIt's unclear who is behind the hack.\n\nManchin is fighting to keep his Senate seat away from Republican challenger Patrick Morrisey in next week's midterm elections. President Trump is holding a campaign rally for Morrisey and other Republicans in West Virginia Friday afternoon.\n\nManchin's office isn't the first to be targeted by hackers. Russians have targeted Sen. Claire McCaskill's office, although they were unsuccessful. McCaskill is another vulnerable Democrat in Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\n\"While this attack was not successful, it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this,\" McCaskill said at the time. \"I will not be intimidated. I've said it before and I will say it again, Putin is a thug and a bully.\"\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, warned his colleagues in September that the state-backed Russian group behind the 2016 Democratic National Committee hacking has also tried to hack the networks of senators and staffers.\n\nManchin, a moderate Democrat, was the only one to vote in favor of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. But that hasn't kept the president from campaigning against him. Still, Manchin has at times spoken favorably of the president in the state that voted for Mr. Trump by the largest margin in 2016.\n\n\"Our president -- whether you voted for him or not he's the president of the United States -- I want him to succeed and do well. And I'll stand up and support him when it's good for West Virginia -- and when it's not, I stand up to him,\" Manchin said in a debate with Morrisey Thursday night.", "President Trump hit many familiar themes Friday afternoon as he stumped for Republican Senate hopeful Patrick Morrisey at a rally in Huntington, West Virginia.\n\nThe president touched on immigration and the migrant caravan approaching the southern border, the economy, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and more, as Republicans look to hold or make gains in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. Mr. Trump has spent the last week focused on controversial immigration tactics, like ending birthright citizenship and making it harder to apply for asylum. Republicans have wanted him to stay on message about the economy, something the president himself recognized.\n\n\"Sometimes it's not as exciting to talk about the economy because we have a lot of other things to talk about,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trump also jokingly threatened to impeach Morrisey if he gets into the Senate and votes against him, and said it isn't easy for First Lady Melania Trump to be married to him.\n\n\"If you think it's easy being a first lady, and married to me, it's not that easy,\" he said.\n\nWest Virginia is Trump country \u2014 the state voted for him over Hillary Clinton by a larger margin than in any other state in 2016. But West Virginia's Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is a relatively popular senator and a moderate Democrat, and the latest polls show Morrisey trailing him. This isn't the first time Mr. Trump has campaigned for Morrisey. He also stumped for the Republican in August and September.\n\nMr. Trump is holding 11 rallies across eight states in the final week of the election.\n\nCBS News / James Morris\n\nOutwardly, the president is optimistic about whether Republicans will keep control of the House, but he has also couched that optimism.\n\n\"It seems that the campaign is doing very well,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn Wednesday. \"Looks like we're doing very very well in the Senate. A lot of seats that were not really being thought of in terms of victories a year ago now look like they could very well be victories. The House is a lot of people, I mean there are a lot of people, and I think we're going to do well in the house also. But I know we're doing well in the Senate but we're doing OK in the House, we're going to have to see. There are just so many people.\"\n\nMany Republicans would like the president to keep his focus on the booming economy, and things like tax cuts, but with four days until the midterms, it is immigration that's on the president's mind and focus of his messaging.\n\nOn Thursday, he delivered remarks in the Roosevelt Room claiming his administration is finalizing plans to deny asylum other than at designated points of entry along the border, and saying he will sign an executive order next week. The president has continued to rail against the caravan of thousands of migrants approaching the southern border, and said he may deploy up to 15,000 troops to deter the migrants. He also said he will end birthright citizenship through executive order or Congress, claiming the 14th Amendment doesn't cover birthright citizenship.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV, Start a free trial", "Despite great news on jobs in October and talk of a possible U.S.-China trade deal in the works, U.S. stocks fell Friday as a big loss from Apple dragged technology companies lower and an increase in interest rates hurt high-dividend companies.\n\nThe iPhone maker, the world's largest technology company, forecast weak revenue growth Thursday evening and said it will stop disclosing quarterly phone sales. Apple shares fell 6.6 percent.\n\nStocks had surged over the previous three days and were still on pace for a big weekly gain after skidding in October to their worst monthly loss in seven years. But positive news Friday seemed to have little no impact on traders. The federal government said employers added 250,000 jobs in October, far more than analysts expected, and hourly pay jumped 3.1 percent, the most since the beginning of 2009.\n\nIn addition, President Donald Trump said Thursday he spoke with China's Xi Jinping and that trade discussions are \"moving along nicely,\" boosting Wall Street's hopes for a resolution to a deepening dispute that threatens tariffs and other penalties on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of business activity between the two economic powers.\n\nThe Dow fell 110 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 25,271. The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq, which has a high concentration of technology companies, lost 1 percent. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 0.2 percent.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose roughly 2 percent this week after strong gains the last three days, but would have to rally another 7.9 percent to match the all-time high it reached on Sept. 20.\n\nA hopeful start\n\nMany investors had started the day hopeful, with overseas stocks up sharply following Mr. Trump's announcement that he has asked U.S. officials to start drafting potential terms for a new trade agreement with China, with the president aiming to reach a new pact while at the Group of 20 nations summit in Argentina later in November, reported Bloomberg News.\n\nTrade tensions have weighed on investor sentiment because the Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese imports sparked more than 100 publicly traded U.S. companies to disclose how much the import duties could hurt them, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab.\n\n\"Companies are saying 'this is biting and here's how,'\" she said. \"They're starting to talk about profit margins and whether they're going to pass the expenses onto consumers.\"\n\nMr. Trump didn't give details about his discussions with Xi, but there have been few signs of movement in the trade dispute in recent months, and investors are getting nervous about the prospect of huge tariff increases, with U.S. markets down almost 10 percent since their highs in August.\n\nJust had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China. We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade. Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina. Also had good discussion on North Korea! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2018\n\nA Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told reporters the discussion was positive and that the two leaders were optimistic about resolving the dispute over trade practices and technology development that has resulted in both sides imposing penalty tariffs on each other's exports. Meanwhile, Chinese state media said Xi has promised tax cuts and other help to China's entrepreneurs in a renewed effort to revive the cooling, state-dominated Chinese economy.\n\nNot so fast: Continuing turmoil?\n\nYet until there's clarity on a trade deal, investors may continue to fret, noted CityIndex analyst Fiona Cincotta.\n\n\"A formal meeting between Trump and his Chinese counterpart will take place later this month at the G-20 summit and is likely to inject volatility into trading until the two sides reach a formal resolution over trade issues,\" she wrote in a research note.\n\nOctober brought a sudden, screeching halt to a milestone-setting September and snapped a six-month winning streak for the benchmark S&P 500 index. Last month clocked in as the worst month for the market since September 2011.\n\nInvestors may be on their toes until the trade dispute is resolved. Mr. Trump \"has been known to blow hot and cold before and during major negotiations and a positive comment today could easily turn into a less than flattering one tomorrow,\" Cincotta noted.\n\nOther analysts were outright skeptical of the prospects for a China trade deal. \"President Trump's reported request for his cabinet to draw up the outline of a 'deal' with China is likely an attempt to support a market rally heading into the midterm elections on November 6 rather than a sign of an imminent breakthrough,\" Height Capital's Clayton Allen argued in a note Friday.\n\nJobs, jobs, jobs\n\nThe Department of Labor said U.S. employers continued to add jobs at a fast clip in October, with no sign that hiring is slowing down. The proportion of Americans with jobs is at its highest level since January 2009, and the monthly increase in pay was also the largest since then. Along with high consumer confidence, those are all good signs for economic growth and consumer spending in the months to come.\n\nBond prices dropped, sending yields sharply higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 3.22 percent, from 3.14 percent. A jump in interest rates last month started the market's downturn, but investors on Friday didn't seem as worried about the increase. \"It clearly was a good report,\" said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nThe wage number, while high, was about what investors were expecting, Lefkowitz said. That's important because investors are still sensitive to signs that inflation could flare up, forcing the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in raising rates. If inflation grows moderately, as it appeared to in October, that's not as likely.\n\nApple cored\n\nApple's sales in its latest quarter and its estimates for the holiday season both disappointed experts. The tech giant also surprised investors by saying it will no longer disclose the number of iPhones it sells each quarter. Apple was unique among big smartphone makers in saying how many phones it sold and what the average price was. Apple gets most of its revenue from iPhone sales and lately it's boosted its profits by selling higher-priced models.\n\nThe unexpected change raised suspicions that Apple might be trying to mask a downturn in the phone's popularity. The company says the quarterly numbers and prices didn't necessarily tell investors how strong its business has been.", "CANBERRA, Australia -- A self-styled preacher who wanted to claim his wife's life insurance was sentenced on Friday to 10 years in prison for persuading her to kill herself in what a judge described as an Australian-first conviction.

Jobs were added in health care, construction, manufacturing and transportation and warehousing.\n\nThe monthly average job creation now stands at about 210,000 for the last three months. That incorporates revised data for September, which saw an unusually low jobs figure thanks to Hurricane Florence. Hurricane Michael, which hit the Florida panhandle last month, did not affect the jobs report, the Labor Department said.\n\nWages jumped. Average monthly earnings increased 3.1 percent from the year before, the first time in the current economic expansion that the figure has crossed the 3 percent mark. Other data released this week shows that compensation costs are now rising more quickly. The last time wages grew this quickly was in early 2009.\n\nThe unemployment rate stayed at 3.7 percent, the lowest it's been in nearly 50 years. Adding to the positive news, the labor participation rate\u2014the share of people working or searching for work\u2014ticked up .2 percent. It moved up half a percentage point for workers in the 25-to-55 age group.\n\n\"This is an astonishingly good jobs report,\" said Julia Pollak, labor economist with the job site ZipRecruiter. \"With the labor participation rate up .2 percent, it shows that people are still coming in off the sidelines. Many people thought that would not be the case.\"\n\nThe good news foreshadows more interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve. \"With consumer confidence at its highest point since 2000 and GDP growth at an impressive 3.5% this quarter, there is an even stronger case for continuing to raise interest rates into 2019,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group.", "PHOENIX \u2014 Two congresswomen running for U.S Senate in Arizona are crisscrossing the state, raising millions of dollars and trying to exploit every possible advantage to eke out a win in what both sides expect to be a photo-finish race.\n\nThe wild card: Angela Green, a Green Party candidate who could win votes that might have gone to Democrat Krysten Sinema, clearing a path to victory for Republican Martha McSally.\n\nBut on Thursday, Green suddenly announced she would drop out of the race and endorsed Sinema.\n\n\"After watching the debates and seeing everything, Sinema's stance on a lot of things are very close to mine,\" Green said in an interview with Channel 12 news in Phoenix.\n\nThe about face demonstrates the significance third party candidates are playing as Election Day nears and key races tighten across the country. There's a fear that these candidates could become \"spoilers\" by peeling off just enough support to let the other major party win. Democrats are especially sensitive to the issue after Green Party and Libertarian presidential candidates drew about 5 percent of the popular vote in 2016, the year that Hillary Clinton narrowly lost the presidency to Donald Trump.\n\n\"When a race is close everything matters -- every demographic group, the number of candidates on the ballot,\" said Nathan Gonzales, a nonpartisan analyst for Inside Elections. But, he added, that doesn't mean third party candidates will inevitably tip a close race. \"We have to be a bit more nuanced.\"\n\nThird party candidates tend to poll better than they actually perform on Election Day, when voters tend to revert to the two major parties. And some who cast ballots for third party candidates may not otherwise show up to the polls, so it's misleading to presume that every vote for an outside candidate is a vote stolen from a major party.\n\nRegardless, it's a fear present on both sides of the aisle. The biggest impact this cycle may be in Kansas, where Democrats fear businessman and independent gubernatorial candidate Greg Orman, who has notched up to 10 percent support in polls.\n\nKansas Democrats worry Orman will help Republican Kris Kobach \u2014 the controversial chair of Mr. Trump's disbanded voter fraud commission \u2014 win the governor's race. On Monday, Orman's treasurer, Republican Tim Owens, quit the campaign because he feared Orman was putting at risk the campaign of Democrat Laura Kelly.\n\n\"I wish Tim well, but have told him that my campaign is about the people of Kansas, not about establishment figures in Topeka,\" Orman said, referring to the state capitol.\n\nIn Georgia, a Libertarian candidate could force one of the nation's most closely watched governor's races into a December runoff.\n\nAnd in Montana, Sen. Jon Tester has repeatedly won campaigns with less than 50 percent of the vote with a Libertarian candidate on the ballot. This week, an anonymous mailer circulated attacking Tester's Republican challenger, Matt Rosendale, and urging a vote for Libertarian Rick Breckenridge.\n\nIn response, on Wednesday, Breckenridge said he was endorsing Rosendale. \"Matt has the character to combat this, not Jon Tester,\" Breckenridge said in an interview.\n\nThe Montana mailer and endorsement come after an anonymous donor earlier this year bankrolled a drive by a firm that normally works for Republicans to collect 5,000 signatures to place a Green Party candidate on the Senate ballot. Secretary of State Corey Stapleton, a Republican, put the candidate on the ballot but Montana Democrats successfully sued to overturn it.\n\nIn Indiana, similar mailers have circulated attacking Republican Mike Braun and promoting the candidacy of Libertarian Lucy Brenton, who openly says she wants to play the role of spoiler. She garnered 5 percent of the vote in a 2016 race and has been onstage in debates that also include Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly and Braun. It's unclear which of the two major party candidates is threatened more by her pro-gay rights, pro-marijuana legalization, anti-tax platform.\n\n\"Do I intend to spoil the election for them? Absolutely. And here's why: something doesn't spoil unless it's rotten,\" Brenton said Tuesday after a debate in Indianapolis. \"And the two-party system that has had a stranglehold on our country is absolutely rotten.\"\n\nNevada has another option \u2014 voters can select \"none of these candidates.\" That helped Sen. Dean Heller win re-election in 2012. Even as then-President Barack Obama handily won the state, Heller was re-elected by an 11,000-vote margin \u2014 a total of 46 percent of the vote. That's because 44,000 voters chose \"none of these candidates\" rather than Heller or his Democratic opponent Rep. Shelley Berkley, who faced a congressional ethics investigation during the race.\n\nHeller is trying to replicate that strategy as he faces another tough race this year against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. Some Republicans think the none of the above option gives Heller a better chance than the Republican running for governor, Adam Laxalt. That's because there's an independent candidate in the race who could spoil it for Laxalt -- Ryan Bundy, the elder son of a rancher who became notorious for his armed standoff with federal agents in 2014.\n\nPolitical maneuverings also helped shape Arizona's ballot. In 2012, Republican Jeff Flake won a U.S. Senate election there by 3.5 percentage points while a Libertarian candidate garnered 4 percentage points. The Republican state legislature complained Libertarians were siphoning GOP votes and increased the number of signatures the party needed to qualify a candidate for the ballot. There was no similar requirement for the Green Party.\n\nGreen's announcement Thursday that she was suspending her campaign may have relatively little impact. More than 60 percent of expected voters have already cast their ballots early, as is traditional in the heavily vote-by-mail state, according to the Secretary of State's office. And Green's name will remain on the ballot for those who haven't made a decision.\n\nMcSally's campaign unsuccessfully pushed to have Green included in the Senate race debate, and some Republicans hold out hope she can chisel off enough supporters from Sinema to put their candidate over the edge. A recent poll from Marist-NBC News, for example, had Sinema leading McSally by 6 percentage points when Green was omitted but only by 3 points when the third party option was included.\n\nStill, others are skeptical Green will effect the race one way or the other. She raised less than $1500 and had little campaign presence while running a business selling organic goods and hemp clothing.\n\n\"At the end of the day I think the real narrative here is who's able to appeal to independent, unaffiliated and Republican women,\" said Paul Bentz, a GOP strategist in Phoenix. \"They'll make the difference here.\"\n\nAs recently as last week, Green said she while didn't support McSally or Mr. Trump, she didn't think she should be held responsible if her candidacy lost the election for Sinema.\n\n\"I will not be responsible for who wins this race,\" Green said in an interview then. \"So I need to let people to know that is not why I came into this race. I came into it for the people, not the politics.\"", "GOP strategist Dan Senor says the \"biggest risk\" to Republicans heading into the midterm elections is President Trump's handling of immigration issues, which he says convey \"chaos.\" Senor served as a senior adviser to Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign.\n\n\"Where I think the president went too far is on this birthright citizenship issue \u2013 for several reasons. One, what he's proposing is unconstitutional. Two, he said sort of in a flip way, not coordinated with anyone in the congressional leadership,'I'll just do this by executive order'... and it just conveyed chaos,\" Senor told \"CBS This Morning\" on Friday, less than a week before election day.\n\nPresident Trump continued making immigration his top issue at a rally Thursday where he discussed the migrant caravan. The president claimed the military will not tolerate violence at the border and any rocks thrown at the military will be treated like \"a firearm.\"\n\nSenor said that although Mr. Trump might have gone too far with his plan to sign an executive order removing the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens born on U.S. soil, the caravan of migrants headed to the U.S border does raise a legitimate policy issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea that we should have a serious policy to make sure that doesn't happen here is legitimate. When thousands of people seem to be coming to the U.S., we need some kind of policy. My impression is from a policy standpoint that's legitimate and politically it's good,\" Senor said.\n\nHe also pointed to the European migration crisis as an example of what could happen if there is no policy in place to deal with the influx of Central American migrants moving toward the southern border.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, typically an ally of President Trump's, condemned his proposal to end birthright citizenship while campaigning for fellow Republicans this week. Senor doesn't see that as a big problem for the president.\n\n\"Ryan both believes it's a mistake to pursue that policy and he thinks it's bad for the members whose seats he's trying to save. Ryan's in the middle of this 25-city tour right now trying to hang on to the Republican majority. So he had to respond, the president punched back. I think that's where it ends. The only reason it ends there is because the two of them basically have a good working relationship, so neither wants to escalate,\" he said. \"There's just so much going on. I thought to myself, we've got five days left before midterms, my math is like that's about 34 tweets\u2026.We're in this constant flurry and this little skirmish with Ryan won't dominate.\"", "", "Actor Jeff Goldblum has made a career of playing slightly offbeat characters in blockbuster films, but not all of that was acting.

The Boston Globe reports that authorities suspect Paul DeCologero, a member of a notorious organized crime group, savagely beat Bulger. Mafia hit man, Fotios \"Freddy\" Geas, is also believed to have been involved in Bulger's killing at a federal prison long been plagued by violence.\n\nA federal law enforcement official told the Associated Press that disciplinary issues prompted the transfer of Bulger to the prison. An official briefed on the investigation said that the 89-year-old former Boston crime boss and longtime FBI informant was transferred to USP Hazelton in West Virginia after causing problems at the prison in Florida, where he had been serving a life sentence for participating in 11 killings.\n\nThe official insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to release details. He said he did not have specifics on Bulger's behavior in Florida, and did not know why Bulger was specifically sent to Hazelton.\n\nBulger, who ran a largely Irish mob in Boston in the 1970s and '80s, ratted on his rivals, the New England Mob, to the FBI while simultaneously running his own crime ring responsible for loansharking, extortion and a string of murders.\n\nBulger fled Boston in late 1994 after being tipped off by his FBI handler that he was about to be indicted. He spent the next 16 years as one of America's most wanted fugitives until he was found in 2011, living with his girlfriend, Catherine Greig, in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica, California.\n\nGreig is currently serving her time behind bars in Minnesota. The Free Press says the 67-year-old Greig is in the Waseca Federal Correctional Institution. She pleaded guilty to harboring a fugitive and identity fraud. She could be released in September of 2020.\n\nMany questions remain about why Bulger was put into the general population at USP Hazelton when his notoriety as a crime boss and FBI informant was highly publicized.\n\nThe FBI has declined to comment on the investigation.\n\nFederal officials have only said they are investigating Bulger's death as a homicide.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Prisons has not responded to requests for comment about safety concerns at USP Hazelton.\n\nRobert Hood, a former warden at the federal supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, said Bulger's age alone would put him potentially at risk in the prison's general population. Add Bulger's notoriety, and Hood said he could not imagine housing him with other inmates.\n\n\"A known snitch in almost every prison is in jeopardy,\" Hood said. \"I don't think it was intentional. I just think they gave too much credit to the age of the inmate, thinking: 'He's old, he's not going to hurt anyone,'\" he said.\n\nBulger's killing marks the third at Hazelton in the last six months.\n\nLast week, five members of Congress wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about what they called \"dangerous continual understaffing\" at federal prisons in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and stated their alarm about the deaths at USP Hazelton.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said DOJ was \"aware of the concerns raised in the letter\" and would respond to the members of Congress.", "", "", "Despite great news on jobs in October and talk of a possible U.S.-China trade deal in the works, U.S. stocks fell Friday as a big loss from Apple dragged technology companies lower and an increase in interest rates hurt high-dividend companies.\n\nThe iPhone maker, the world's largest technology company, forecast weak revenue growth Thursday evening and said it will stop disclosing quarterly phone sales.

He made his comments at the White House in a rambling, campaign-style speech that was billed as a response to caravans of migrants traveling slowly by foot toward the U.S. border. But Mr. Trump offered few details on how exactly he planned to overhaul an asylum system he claimed was plagued by \"endemic abuse\" that he said \"makes a mockery of our immigration system.\"\n\nU.S. immigration laws make clear that migrants seeking asylum may do so either at or between border crossings. But Trump said he would limit that to official crossing points. The U.S. also doesn't have space at the border to manage the large-scale detention of migrants, with most facilities at capacity. The president said the government would erect \"massive tents\" instead.\n\nHis announcement marked Mr. Trump's latest attempt to keep the issue of immigration front-and-center in the final stretch before next Tuesday's elections. He has spent the waning days of the campaign hammering the issue at every occasion as he tries to energize Republican voters using the same playbook that helped him win in 2016. In addition to deploying the military to the southern border to stave off the caravan, Mr. Trump announced plans to try to end the constitutionally-protected right of birthright citizenship for all children born in the U.S.\n\nHe brought up immigration issues several times during a political rally Thursday night in Columbia, Missouri. He railed against \"birth tourism,\" where mothers from abroad travel to America to have babies so they will automatically be U.S. citizens. And he denounced \"chain migration,\" where these new citizens then bring in their extended families into the country.\n\n\"You come into the country \u2014 you're like two months old ... and you're gonna bring 'em all \u2014 your aunts and uncles and grandfathers and lots of people,\" he said.\n\nThe president also announced Wednesday that he was considering deploying up to 15,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexican border in response to the caravans \u2014 roughly double the number the Pentagon said it currently plans for a mission that has been criticized as unnecessary, considering the caravans remain hundreds of miles away.\n\nMr. Trump said Thursday he was \"not going to put up with\" any sort of violence directed at those U.S. forces, warning the military would fight back. \"When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle,\" he said.\n\nThe exact rules for the use of force by military police and other soldiers who will be operating near the border have not been disclosed, but in all cases troops have the right of self-defense.\n\nStill, Mark Hertling, a retired Army general, wrote on Twitter after Mr. Trump's speech that no military officer would allow a soldier to shoot an individual throwing a rock. \"It would be an unlawful order,\" he wrote, citing the Law of Land Warfare.\n\nThe president said Thursday that, under his order, any migrants who do enter the country would be housed in \"massive tent cities\" he plans to build while their cases are processed.\n\nMany migrants have been dropping out and returning home or applying for protected status in Mexico. \"We're going to catch, we're not going to release,\" he said.\n\nUnder current protocol, many asylum seekers are released while their cases make their way through backlogged courts \u2014 a process that can take years.\n\nCritics said the speech seemed mostly designed to scare, with no specifics on what mechanisms Mr. Trump intended to use to push through his desired changes. Administration officials have told The AP that Mr. Trump intends to invoke the same authority he used to push through his controversial travel ban, but it's not clear if that's what he was doing with Thursday's speech.\n\n\"He's really trying to scare the American public into thinking these are thousands of dangerous thugs,\" said Greg Chen, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"It's a classic strategy that goes back to 19th century nativist thinking.\"\n\nMr. Trump and other administration officials have long said those seeking asylum should come through legal ports of entry. But many migrants are unaware of that guidance, and official border crossings have grown increasingly clogged. Immigration officials have turned away asylum-seekers at border crossings because of overcrowding, telling them to return at a later date. Backlogs have become especially bad in recent months at crossings in California, Arizona and Texas, with people generally waiting five weeks to try to claim asylum at San Diego's main crossing and sleeping out in the open for days at a time.\n\nMigrants who cross illegally are generally arrested and often seek asylum or some other form of protection. Claims have spiked in recent years, and there is currently a backlog of more than 800,000 cases pending in immigration court. Administration officials have railed against what they say are loopholes designed to encourage people, especially from Central America, to come to the U.S. and claim asylum. Generally, only about 20 percent of applicants are approved.\n\nThe U.S. fielded more than 330,000 asylum claims in 2017, nearly double the number two years earlier and surpassing Germany as highest in the world.\n\nGraphic shows arrests made along the U.S.-Mexico border. But it remains unclear how many people currently en route to the U.S. will even make it to the border.\n\nThere are currently four caravans. The main group of about 4,000 migrants \u2014 down from its estimated peak of more than 7,000 \u2014 remains in southern Mexico, hundreds of miles from the border. A second, smaller group of 1,000 or so is more than 200 miles behind the first.

Indonesian investigators will also travel to the U.S. to meet with the designers of the new-generation Boeing jet.\n\nOn Thursday, the team displayed one of the jet's two flight recorders at a news conference, later confirmed to be the flight data recorder, and said they would immediately attempt to download information and begin an analysis.\n\nBut progress has been hampered by the black box not being fully intact and it needs special handling to ensure its data survive, a process that is continuing, according to the National Transport Safety Committee. It said the \"crash-survivable memory unit\" was opened and washed and some of its wiring will need to be replaced and a new shell provided from Lion Air to enable a download of data.\n\n\"In principle, all data we have obtained, including flight data and air navigation, and also from other sources - we find that there have indeed been problems\" with the plane, said Haryo Satmiko, deputy chairman of the transport safety committee. \"We will prove more technical problems with data recorded in the black box.\"\n\nAvi Riyanto, director of airworthiness at the transport ministry, said it is closely monitoring flights of other Boeing 737 MAX planes in Indonesia.\n\n\"The currently operating Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft have been inspected and we will continue to monitor and supervise closely, day by day, and if it is found to be significant we will do another inspection and ground them if needed.\"\n\nSearching the seas\n\nREUTERS\n\nHundreds of personnel and dozens of vessels including specialized ships with sonar and other detection technology are involved in the search effort in seas northeast of Jakarta.

Victims in the U.S. and Canada say they lost nearly a billion dollars to scammers over the last three years.\n\nBut those same victims rarely speak out because they're embarrassed and humiliated and most are women over 50, single and looking for love, reports CBS News' Meg Oliver.\n\nThe online romance started in January when Roxanne Reed fell for someone she met on Facebook, who called themselves Scott Humpal. Reed claims the scammer started asking for money to pay medical bills. Even though they never met in person, she sent the stranger more than $50,000 over seven months.\n\nCBS News\n\nWhen family members finally reported the scam, investigators allege that Reed \u2013 now out of money \u2013 had been plotting to kill her 88-year-old mother. She's now been charged with several counts of fraud and conspiracy to commit murder with the fake Scott Humpal.\n\n\n\nThe real Scott Humpal lives more than 1,200 miles away in Corpus Christi, Texas. Seven years ago, Humpal's wife died in a plane crash and soon after, he started receiving suspicious messages on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\"It just seemed odd because I didn't know them.

But for catfishing victims like 73-year-old Beverley Franzke, those red flags are often missed.

I've always taken care of people and it was one promise after another.

The other says there's no reason for people to worry.\n\nNo new research was issued Thursday. Instead, the National Toxicology Program dialed up its concerns about a link to heart and brain cancer from a study of male rats that was made public last winter.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, which oversees cellphone safety, disagreed with the upgraded warning. And \"these findings should not be applied to human cellphone usage,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, FDA's chief of radiological health.\n\nWhat's most important is what happens in humans, not rats, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"The incidence of brain tumors in human beings has been flat for the last 40 years,\" Brawley said. \"That is the absolute most important scientific fact.\"\n\nThe original study\n\nIn a $30 million study, scientists put rats and mice into special chambers and bombarded them with radiofrequency waves, like those emitted by older 2G and 3G phones, for nine hours a day for up to two years, most of their natural lives.\n\nThe levels the rodents experienced were far higher than people are typically exposed to.\n\nThe findings\n\nLast February, the National Toxicology Program said there was a small increase in an unusual type of heart tumor in male rats, but not in mice or female rats. The agency concluded there was \"some evidence\" of a link. Also, the February report cited \"equivocal evidence\" of brain tumors in the male rats.\n\nThursday, the agency upgraded its description of those findings. The heart tumor increase marked \"clear evidence\" of cancer in male rats, it announced. There is \"some evidence\" of brain cancer.\n\nThe change came after the agency asked outside experts to analyze the findings.\n\n\"We believe that the link between radiofrequency radiation and tumors in male rats is real, and the external experts agreed,\" said John Bucher, the toxicology agency's senior scientist.\n\nWhile his agency said the risks to rats don't directly apply to people, the study raises safety questions.\n\nThe disagreement\n\nThe FDA immediately disagreed, firing off a press release assuring Americans that \"decades of research and hundreds of studies\" has made the health agency confident that the current safety limits for cellphone radiation protect the public health.\n\nPlus, the FDA pointed to confusing findings from the rodent study - such as that the radiated rats lived longer than comparison rats that weren't exposed to the rays. The toxicology agency said it appeared that the radiofrequency energy helped older rats' kidneys.\n\nThere's a reason two different government agencies are clashing - they're asking different questions, said George Washington University public health professor George Gray.\n\nA former science chief for the Environmental Protection Agency, Gray said the toxicology program examined how cellphone radiation affected animals.

She cares about medicaid expansion, keeping families together,\" she said.\n\nJessica McGowan / Getty Images\n\nShe also went door to door, to the shock of some Georgia voters.\n\nWinfrey is a registered independent and has only stumped for one other major candidate: Barack Obama.

Five separate early-morning accidents in Indiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Florida have ended in fatalities for five students and left six other children hospitalized, two of them with serious injuries.\n\nThe string of deadly incidents began on Tuesday, when a 9-year-old girl and her twin 6-year-old brothers were struck and killed by a pickup truck while crossing the street to board their school bus in Rochester, Indiana. Another child who was injured had to be airlifted to a hospital. The pickup truck driver has been charged with three counts of reckless homicide.\n\nA day later, a 9-year-old boy in Baldwyn, Mississippi, was struck and killed while crossing the street to board a school bus. That same day, a 5-year-old boy was hit by a car and injured while crossing in front of his school bus in Tallahassee, Florida. CBS affiliate WCTV reports the kindergartner has been released from the hospital and is doing well.\n\nThen on Thursday morning a 7-year-old boy was found dead by his school bus driver in Franklin Township, Pennsylvania, the apparent victim of a hit-and-run while he waited at his bus stop. Later that morning, five children and two adults were hospitalized in Tampa after being struck by a driver while waiting for a school bus to arrive. Two of the children sustained serious injuries, according to Steve Hegarty, a public information officer at the Tampa Police Department.\n\n\"This is a huge problem we've been experiencing all around Mississippi,\" said Captain John Poulos, a director in the Public Affairs Division at the Mississippi Highway Patrol, in a telephone interview CBS News on Thursday. \"Distracted driving plays a huge role with stopped school buses.\"\n\nPoulos said motorists passing stopped school buses became such an issue in the state that legislators passed \"Nathan's Law\" in 2011, which increased fines for illegally passing stopped school buses as well as increased sentencing for offenders when someone was injured.\n\nBecause of this law, the motorist involved involved in the fatal crash in Mississippi was charged with aggravated assault, and CBS affiliate WCBI reports the charges could be upgraded. Charges have not yet been filed against the motorist involved in the accident in Tampa, according to Hegarty.\n\nAs smartphone use, digital dashboard displays and other mobile technology have proliferated, so have the number of automobile crashes involving distracted drivers. The most recent data from the NTSB shows 3,450 people were killed and 391,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2015.\n\n\"Distracted driving is an issue anywhere where people have cellphones, so everywhere,\" said Hegarty, who noted that the Tampa Police Department was looking at distracted driving as a cause of Thursday morning's accident after ruling out darkness and impairment.", "The #MeToo movement hit Google on Thursday as thousands of employees walked out of their offices.

Authorities described Ward as an armed burglary suspect.\n\nIf convicted, Durocher faces up to life in prison, reports the Virginian-Pilot.\n\nAuthorities say the shooting occurred as police responded to a burglary call in a residential neighborhood in the southeast Virginia city. Ward was seen on video running away as Durocher opened fire.\n\nDurocher's attorney, Nicholas Renninger, said in April Ward was a clear danger because he was armed. In the video, Durocher can be heard yelling, \"He has a gun!\"\n\n\"He had it flying like, towards me,\" Durocher is heard saying after he opens fire.\n\nBut Ward told the newspaper in April he never pulled his gun. Police said they found a loaded handgun, but it was in Ward's pant leg.\n\n\"I was just pretty much trying to get away. Showing no aggression,\" Ward said. \"I feel he shot for no reason.\"\n\nWard took a plea agreement in June and was sentenced to six years in prison on burglary charges.\n\n\"The law does not afford police officers the luxury of shooting first and asking questions later. The evidence in this case will show that Officer Durocher had no legal authority whatsoever to shoot this young man in the back,\" S.W. Dawson, Ward's attorney, said in a statement to WTKR. \"What's nearly worse, this officer's explanation of why he did what he did doesn't match up with the facts.\"\n\nLt. B.K.

Why? I knew most of them would not continue as biology majors, so I figured I had one semester, sometimes two if they took Bio II, to increase their awareness \u2013 and thus their appreciation \u2013 for all life on Earth. I figured if they were out looking for native wildflowers and learned the names of a few of them they would care more about them, and hopefully think about the effects of our ever-expanding human population. Maybe they would even notice a few of them the following spring.\n\nI always thought of that process as educating their eyeballs. I worked on educating their brains in the classroom and lab, but out in the field, and even on their own, I hoped they would get some eyeball education.\n\nThere are, of course, many wonderful things out there for our eyes to learn. One of my favorites was watching students see the Tetons for the first time. Many of our students had never strayed far from highly-industrialized Baytown, Texas. For several summers we took students on a six -week trip throughout the west, culminating in a week in both Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks. They learned environmental science and plant taxonomy, took the same tests as our regular semester students, and never made anything less than a B.\n\nWe never said a word as we drove north out of Jackson, Wyoming, just south of the Grand Tetons, waiting to round the final corner and have a full view of the mountains. Their reaction was always the same. There were immediate, enthusiastic requests to stop for photos, which often resulted in an inevitable snowball fight. These were people who were seeing both gorgeous mountains and snow for the first time! Their enthusiasm was wonderfully infectious, almost as if I were seeing those mountains for the first time myself \u2013 one of the many gifts they unknowingly gave their teacher.\n\nThe Tetons are extremely easy to notice and appreciate. Some natural wonders aren't so obvious. When you look at this photo of a male elk bugling, what do you see? Stupid question, right? You see a magnificent animal calling to defend its territory from other males. But look behind him and you see a mountain with trees and a light dusting of snow. Notice where the trees are located? They don't cover every inch of the mountain. Why not? The answer is microclimates, which lead to some major differences on mountainsides, even ones relatively close to each other. Ecologists know this as the North-South Slope Effect.\n\nThe location of a hill or mountain on Earth, and the direction the sun hits it, has a major effect on what vegetation, and thus animal life, can survive on that hill or mountain. The Tetons and the surrounding hills are close to a latitude of 45 degrees North, halfway between the equator and the North Pole. The sun's rays hit the flat valley floor east of the Tetons at a 45-degree angle during the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. But what about the hillsides?\n\nDuring the vernal or autumnal equinoxes, at a latitude of 45 degrees, a hill with a south-facing slope (as illustrated in the drawing below) receives the same amount of solar energy as flat ground in the Sahara Desert. The amount of sunlight hitting the north slope of the same hill would be similar to that at Point Barrow in northern Alaska. Two extremely different climates, normally thousands of miles apart, are now within a few feet of each other.\n\nVerne Lehmberg\n\nThe result is two very different microclimates. The south-facing slope is much hotter and drier, therefore the vegetation is sparse and desert-like. Not a tree in sight. The north-facing slope is much cooler, so it retains more moisture and has a much richer variety of vegetation, including several species of trees.\n\nThe north-south slope effect is just one way plant and animal life vary from what would normally be expected in mountainous areas. Next time you travel through the mountains, look for it and experience the differences for yourself. Your eyes will learn something.\n\n\n\nJudy Lehmberg is a former college biology teacher who now shoots nature videos.\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\nTo watch extended \"Sunday Morning\" Nature videos click here!", "As the U.S. grapples with lead contamination in water in cities including Newark, New Jersey, and Flint, Michigan, the toxin remains on store shelves as the active ingredient in at least two brands of hair dye geared to men.\n\nAfter decades of debate, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week said it is banning lead acetate from hair dye, the only consumer product in which it is still legally permitted as an ingredient, and even then with a warning.\n\n\"There is no longer a reasonable certainty of no harm from the approved use of lead acetate in hair coloring products,\" the FDA said in a statement.\n\nThe agency is giving manufacturers a year to reformulate products without the chemical, already banned in Canada and the European Union, and urged consumers to read labels for ingredients in the meantime.\n\n\"There is no safe exposure level for lead,\" stated the FDA, citing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. \"There were deficiencies identified in a 1980 study estimating exposure to lead from hair dye that originally supported its use; and the fact that blood lead levels in the U.S. have dropped significantly since 1980, so we no longer can conclude that potential exposure to lead from lead acetate-containing hair dyes is insignificant,\" the agency explained.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nLead acetate darkens gray hair when used for several days, and has for decades been used in a few men's hair dyes, with Grecian Formula perhaps the best known.\n\nCombe, a privately held maker of personal care products, created the men's hair color category when it came out with Grecian Formula 16 in 1962 -- nearly four decades later it still held more than 70 percent of the market, led by its Just For Men brand.

Mr. Trump called birthright citizenship a \"crazy, lunatic policy\" and vowed to end it, although it's unclear if that's possible.\n\nHawley, the state's attorney general, has tied himself closely to Mr. Trump during the race, and promised that he would vote in line with the president's priorities. McCaskill has tried to keep the race about local issues, especially health care. McCaskill has accused Hawley of wanting to strip health coverage for pre-existing conditions, which he denies.

The president has largely focused on illegal immigration in the days before the election, a topic which could motivate Mr. Trump's base to turn out and vote in the midterms even though he is not on the ballot.\n\nCBS News / James Morris\n\nIn addition to his usual claims that Democrats support \"open borders,\" the president has largely focused on a caravan of migrants en route to the United States from Central America, and which are several weeks away from arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. Earlier on Thursday, Mr. Trump discussed illegal immigration at the White House.\n\nAt a rally in Florida Wednesday, he said that \"we're getting prepared for the caravan. Folks, you don't have to worry about that.\" Most of the migrants are seeking asylum. Over 5,000 active-duty military troops have been sent to guard the border, and Mr. Trump reporters Wednesday that he may send up to 15,000 troops to the border, which is more than number currently deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nThis week, he has also threatened to end aid to some Central American countries, and in an interview that Axios aired Tuesday, he said he intends to end birthright citizenship by executive order.", "CBS Corp. posted strong results during the three-month period when CEO Leslie Moonves exited after allegations of sexual assault. And interim CEO Joe Ianniello stressed continuity in a conference call with analysts Thursday.\n\n\"I don't see any significant changes,\" Ianniello said in response to an analyst's question about the company's direction. Ianniello has appointed a new CFO and new chief creative officer, both of whom had come from CBS' Showtime division. \"They've been with the company several years. These are seasoned veterans,\" Ianniello said.\n\nHe said CBS' success had come from content, and that would continue. \"I don't see any change in that philosophy.\"\n\nOnly one analyst asked a question about Moonves and the changes to management.\n\nCBS had its best third quarter ever, Ianniello said. The company made a $690 million profit on $3.26 billion in revenue in the three months ending Sept. 30.\n\nEarlier this year, CBS sued its controlling shareholder, National Amusements, to avoid a merger with Viacom; it settled the lawsuit in September. The company has hired two law firms to investigate the allegations against Moonves and reports of a corporate culture toxic to women.\n\nMoonves, who had led CBS since it split from Viacom in 2006, left the company on Sept. 9, six weeks after a story in the New Yorker detailing allegations of sexual misconduct. The stock sank on the initial report. But CBS shares were trading above $58 Thursday, slightly higher than their value just before the New Yorker report on July 27.\n\nThe CBS board is continuing its search for a permanent replacement for Moonves, with Ianniello a candidate to get the job on a permanent basis.", "Although President Donald Trump is hinting at a possible trade deal with China, for now the dispute is seeping into companies' earnings reports and financial forecasts.\n\nTariffs already imposed and threatened by the White House are heightening inflation worries as companies across industries raise prices on everything from new homes and drills to handbags and autos as they cope with higher costs.\n\nA 10 percent tariff on $200 billion in Chinese goods took effect in September -- that tranche of tariffs is slated to more than double, to 25 percent, in January. Mr. Trump has renewed threats to tax every good coming in from China.\n\nGlobal stocks rose after Mr. Trump's tweet on Thursday saying he had had a \"very good conversation\" with President Xi Jingping of China regarding trade issues. A Bloomberg report that the president has directed Cabinet officials to draft a potential trade agreement with Beijing also seemed to cheer investors, with U.S. stocks edging up in early trade.\n\nAnalysts sounded note of caution on the prospects for a deal. \"President Trump's reported request for his cabinet to draw up the outline of a 'deal' with China is likely an attempt to support a market rally heading into the midterm elections on November 6 rather than a sign of an imminent breakthrough,\" Height Capital's Clayton Allen said in a note Friday.\n\n\"It all gets passed on to the consumer\"\n\nFor now, that leaves corporations to deal with the effects of heightened U.S. protectionism on their business.\n\nThe impact of rising costs is unmistakable and broad. GM is offering 18,000 U.S. employees a buyout as part of its overall efforts to slash expenses. And Ford earlier in the fall pointed to $1 billion in possible new costs from the metal tariffs. Heavy manufacturers are also raising prices, including United Technologies, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners.\n\n\"I would expect pricing will also have to increase next year if these tariffs remain in place,\" United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told investors on the company's third-quarter conference call. \"Ultimately these tariffs -- it all gets passed onto the consumer in one form or another.\"\n\nEven the U.S. metal producers, which were supposed to benefit the most from steel and aluminum tariffs imposed in June, watched their stocks fall this year amid concern the economy will slow because of trade friction worldwide, Bloomberg reported. U.S. manufacturers are paying about 8 percent more for aluminum and 38 percent more for steel than a year ago as the metal tariffs take hold, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Items carrying a tariff at this point represent approximately two-thirds of our imports from China,\" Donald Allan Jr., CFO of Stanley Black & Decker told investors on the company's third-quarter conference call. \"About 90 percent of this impact is composed of finished goods. Some key categories include mechanics' tools, power tool accessories, vacuums and some hand tools.\"\n\nThe latest tranche of China tariffs could cost $200 million more next year on top of 2018's price increases, the company said. Stanley Black & Decker will pass on those costs to customers, he said.\n\n\"No easy solution to this challenge\"\n\nFor consumers, the big hit may come next year if the Trump administration holds to its promise of hiking tariffs on Chinese goods to 25 percent.\n\n\"We will be raising selling prices in 2019,\" Steven Madden CEO Ed Rosenfeld told analysts on the company's third-quarter call. Because Steve Madden acts mostly as a wholesaler, negotiations are underway with retailers. While there's \"no easy solution to this challenge,\" Rosenfeld said he thinks his company can temper most of the cost jump.\n\nThat includes \"aggressively\" moving production out of China as fast as possible. Steve Madden raised its goal of moving production for some products, including handbags, to at least 40 percent and as high as 50 percent. Just three months earlier, that forecast was 30 percent, Rosenfeld said on the call.\n\nMarkets may yet get more jittery as Mr. Trump recently revived his threat to impose tariffs on all Chinese goods if the U.S. and China can't reach an agreement on trade. That means costs will keep going up, perhaps threatening the U.S. economy's robust pace of growth.\n\nLarry Kudlow, a chief economic adviser to Mr. Trump, recently said there may be \"a little thaw\" ahead of Mr. Trump's meeting with China's Xi Jinping at a G-20 meeting in Argentina later this month, hinting that China tariffs could be put on hold.\n\n\"You won't be able to call off the exodus\"\n\nYet for consumer-goods makers, once the decision to use a supplier or factory in another country is made, there's no turning back, said Rick Helfenbein, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. The AAFA says it represents more than 1,000 brands.\n\n\"The thing that's really bad about this -- that most people don't get -- is that after the election next Tuesday, on Wednesday if Trump gets up and says 'I call off this with China,' you won't be able to call off the exodus,\" said Helfenbein, who just returned from a trip to Asia to check out the situation for his members.\n\nCompanies spent the past several decades setting up their supply system in China as factories there perfected low-cost productivity and have simple shipping routes to the U.S. West Coast. Footwear and clothing retailers, in particular, still require humans to put together goods, Helfenbein said.\n\nAs production shifts, finding substitute capacity for factories in other countries while keeping costs low is difficult and could can take years or even decades. For consumers, that means higher prices.\n\nMr. Trump \"has now baked inflation right into the system. Therefore, prices will go up no matter what,\" Helfenbein said. \"There's no going back at this point. We can't suddenly call off the dogs. This is going to affect us for the next 10 or 20 years.\"", "The number of babies born to unauthorized immigrant parents in the U.S. fell to 250,000 in 2016, the lowest figure since 2000, according to a new Pew Research Center report published Thursday afternoon. Such births have decreased 36 percent since hitting a peak of about 390,000 in 2007, the researchers said.\n\nThe new data comes as President Trump is focusing new attention on the issue by vowing to eliminate birthright citizenship, the constitutional provision that children born in the U.S. are automatically American citizens.\n\nChildren born to undocumented immigrants accounted for 6 percent of the 4 million births in the U.S. in 2016, the Pew Research Center estimated, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In total, about 5 million U.S.-born children under age 18 were living with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent, Pew said.\n\nBecause these births occur on American soil, the children qualify for birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, \"Axios on HBO\" released video of an interview with President Trump in which he said he intends to sign an executive order that would repeal birthright citizenship.\n\n\"We're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. And it has to end.\" (In fact, Canada and more than two dozen other countries have similar laws.)\n\nMany legal experts dispute the president's claim that he can revoke birthright citizenship by executive order, and any such action is certain to face immediate court challenges.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who also opposes birthright citizenship, said Tuesday he would introduce legislation in Congress to end the practice. Graham referred to the current law as a \"magnet for illegal immigration.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly took aim at \"anchor babies,\" a derogatory term used to describe U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants. \"What happens is they're in Mexico, they're going to have a baby, they move over here for a couple of days, they have the baby,\" Mr. Trump said in a 2015 Fox News interview.\n\nHowever, data from the Urban Institute shows that most such families did not come to the U.S. just to give birth. More than 70 percent of birthright citizens were born to unauthorized immigrant parents who had been living in the United States for at least five years, according to an Urban Institute study from 2016. Nearly 20 percent of had parents who had been living in the United States for over 20 years -- since they were children themselves.\n\nThe number of immigrants engaging in \"birth tourism,\" or deliberate travel into the United States solely to achieve birthright citizenship for a newborn, is minimal, said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the D.C.-based Migration Policy Institute. That practice is already illegal.\n\n\"This is a very, very small minority of people,\" Capps told CBS News in a telephone interview. \"The large majority of children receiving birthright citizenship have parents who have been here for a substantial amount of time.\"\n\nWhile many Republicans have claimed that ending birthright citizenship would reduce the population of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., Capps' research at the Urban Institute found the opposite: ending citizenship for such children would simply add them to the undocumented population.", "Something dreadful is coming to Showtime, but viewers won't be upset. The network announced that it is reviving \"Penny Dreadful\" with a new show called \"Penny Dreadful: City of Angels.\"\n\nThe new chapter of \"Dreadful\" will be set in 1938 Los Angeles, in a neighborhood with a vibrant Mexican-American community. The show will explore the tensions between characters who worship Santa Muerte and those who are \"allied with the Devil.\" The press release promised that \"Penny Dreadful: City of Angels\" will include supernatural and realistic elements from the period, along with \"new occult myths and moral dilemmas within a genuine historical backdrop.\" All of the characters and storylines will be new.\n\nThe show is in good hands: John Logan, creator, writer and executive producer of the original \"Penny Dreadful\" returns to the revival in the same roles. Production is expected to begin in 2019.\n\n\"'Penny Dreadful: City of Angels' will have a social consciousness and historical awareness that we chose not to explore in the 'Penny Dreadful' London storylines,\" Logan said in a statement. \"We will now be grappling with specific historical and real world political, religious, social and racial issues. In 1938, Los Angeles was facing some hard questions about its future and its soul. Our characters must do the same. There are no easy answers. There are only powerful questions and arresting moral challenges. As always in the world of 'Penny Dreadful,' there are no heroes or villains in this world, only protagonists and antagonists; complicated and conflicted characters living on the fulcrum of moral choice.\"\n\n\"Penny Dreadful\" aired for three seasons from 2014 to 2016. The original series, which starred Eva Green, snagged 13 Emmy nods.

Word of its demise came just days after NASA announced that the Kepler space telescope met a similar fate.\n\nFlight controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, knew the Dawn spacecraft was virtually out of propellant to keep its solar arrays pointed at the sun and for aiming its main antenna back at Earth. And sure enough, on Wednesday the spacecraft failed to make contact as scheduled.\n\nEngineers quickly concluded Dawn had finally exhausted its supply of hydrazine fuel. It remains in a stable orbit around Ceres, but for all intents and purposes, the spacecraft is dead.\n\n\"The fact that my car's license plate frame proclaims 'my other vehicle is in the main asteroid belt' shows how much pride I take in Dawn,\" Marc Rayman, the mission director, said in a statement. \"The demands we put on Dawn were tremendous, but it met the challenge every time. It's hard to say goodbye to this amazing spaceship, but it's time.\"\n\nCarol Raymond, the mission's principal investigator, said the data and images beamed back by dawn over the course of its mission \"will be deeply mined by scientists working on how planets grow and differentiate, and when and where life could have formed in our solar system.\"\n\n\"Ceres and Vesta are important to the study of distant planetary systems, too, as they provide a glimpse of the conditions that may exist around young stars,\" she said.\n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/MPS/DLR/IDA/ASI/INAF\n\nOn Tuesday, NASA announced the planet-hunting Kepler spacecraft had finally run out of propellant after a successful nine-and-a-half-year mission. But Dawn and Kepler operated long beyond their original design requirements, both awarded mission extensions because of the high value placed on their science observations.\n\nLaunched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Sept. 27, 2007, Dawn used a low-power ion propulsion system to fly past Mars in 2009, using the red planet's gravity for a velocity boost, and slipped into orbit around Vesta in July 2011.\n\nThe spacecraft discovered that Vesta is where a specific variety of meteorites found on Earth originated after a huge impact in the distant past. The asteroid features a differentiated iron core, a silicate mantle and igneous rocks in its crust, along with carbon rich compounds that apparently were deposited by impacting bodies.\n\nAfter more than a year of close-range observations, Dawn used its ion engine to leave Vesta behind in September 2012, reaching its second target -- Ceres -- in March 2015. The spacecraft found that Ceres, a dwarf planet like Pluto and the only such body in the asteroid belt, was once an ocean world where salts and other deposits indicating a watery past are now exposed on the surface.\n\n\"Today, we celebrate the end of our Dawn mission, its incredible technical achievements, the vital science it gave us and the entire team who enabled the spacecraft to make these discoveries,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's science administrator. \"The astounding images and data that Dawn collected from Vesta and Ceres are critical to understanding the history and evolution of our solar system.\"", "GAMBRILLS, Md. \u2014 At Arundel High School outside of Baltimore, Friday nights in the fall mean football.

The company expects fiscal first-quarter 2019 revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, below analysts' expectations.\n\nIt reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $14.13 billion, giving the Cupertino, California-based company net income of $2.91 per share. That surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $2.79 per share.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products posted revenue of $62.9 billion in the period, which also topped Street forecasts. Ten analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $61.49 billion.\n\nMore profit per iPhone\n\nUpping the price for its new lineup of iPhones seems to be working out for Apple's bottom line. Despite selling fewer smartphones than analysts expected in its latest fiscal quarter, it's earning more on each phone than Wall Street anticipated, driving profits higher than ever.\n\nApple reported the average selling price of each iPhone sold during the quarter was $793, a leap from $618 in the year-ago quarter and better than analysts' estimates of $750.\n\nIt sold 46.9 million iPhones in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, below the 48.4 million Wall Street expected, but it generated $37.2 billion in iPhone revenue, partly because of the pricier smartphones.

On \"The Takeout\" podcast this week, Conant and host CBS News' Major Garrett discussed the election and the critical races which could decide which party controls the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\"People are more engaged in politics now, for better or for worse,\" Conant said about the impact that President Trump has had on electoral politics this year. \"The Democrats especially seem to have an edge and an enthusiasm gap, and they are hoping to have a very high turnout that will help them take over the House and potentially make gains in the Senate.\"\n\nConant identified some close House races as potential early indicators of whether the Democrats will make significant gains in Congress. On the East coast, she said that Pennsylvania and New Jersey could be bellwether states, as well as Virginia. In the Midwest, she mentioned Republican-held seats in Minnesota which Democrats are hoping to flip.\n\nDemocrats would need to see a 23-seat gain to win control. However, if the margin between Democrats and Republicans is close, it could be difficult for Democrats to get anything done, Conant observed.\n\nOn the Senate side, Conant pointed out the Texas Senate race between Sen. Ted Cruz and Democrat Beto O'Rourke as one to watch, as well as a tight races in states which Mr. Trump won, such as the one between Sen. Claire McCaskill and Republican Josh Hawley. Mr. Trump won Missouri handily in 2016, but that was partially because Democratic turnout was down. That could change this year.\n\n\"Turnout was very low for Hillary Clinton in St. Louis in 2016, so they're hoping that they can get that up,\" Conant told Garrett.\n\nPresident Trump's campaign presence is an important factor in the midterms, and he has been making immigration a key talking point in rallies ahead of the election.\n\n\"At first, Trump and the Republicans were talking about his record of results in the first year,\" Conant said. \"Now, he is talking about what he will do. He has made bold promises, just like he did on the campaign trail (in 2016).\"\n\nWhile neither Democrats or Republicans have offered a vision for the future, Conant said, Mr. Trump has lately been raising actions he might take on immigration, like barring asylum seekers from entry at the southern border, erecting tent cities to house those seeking asylum, and ending birthright citizenship.\n\n\"I think Trump realizes that, 'In order to get people to turn out, I need to talk about what I'm going to do,'\" she said.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV.

The company has added a new option to allow users to identify as a voter on their profile, and to thus inform potential matches of a commitment to cast a ballot in November. The app then sends push notifications to remind users to show up at the polls.\n\n\"It really comes back to the idea of being a company that leads with our values, always,\" says Simmer.\n\nBumble's initiative comes as the dating app Tinder is re-upping it's \"Swipe the Vote\" campaign from 2016 to this year's midterm election, which shares election facts with users along with tools and resources to register and show up to vote. And Snapchat announced it registered over 400,000 people on its platform, adding a voter registration link on to users' profiles and creating filters designed to encourage their friends to register.\n\nRide sharing companies are taking the get out the vote mantra literally, by giving discounted rides to polling locations on Election Day. Lyft, for example, is granting 50 percent off rides to the polls. \"In the 2016 election, over 15 million people were registered but didn't vote due to lack of transportation. This year, we're giving you the tools so you don't ghost the polls,\" Lyft said in announcing its program. Meanwhile, Uber is giving $10 discounts on Election Day, and free rides in some locations.\n\nOn National Registration Day last month, the music streaming app Pandora teamed up with the artist Common to tape an ad promoting voting and directing users to register and find their polling locations. \"It's your chance to make sure your voice is heard,\" Common says in the spot. \"Tap the link on your screen now to make sure these midterms are on your terms.\"\n\nPandora, which has 71 million active users who listen for about 24 hours a month, has also become a key place for campaigns and voting groups to advertise and mobilize voters. \"With so much heated content out there on social media, safe places in digital are harder to find and we can offer a clean targeting,\" says Sean Duggan, vice president of political advertising at Pandora, noting that 40 percent of the company's users are cord cutters who are often hard to reach through traditional media.\n\nPlus, their data can be valuable for campaigns looking to turn out specific voters. \"The flexibility we have is that with a robust registration data and user interaction, there a lot we can smartly target, whether it's Latino or African American voters...or a conservative Republican campaign concerned about turning out in a specific state,\" says Duggan.\n\nBut even amid increased interest in the midterm and voter registration, voter mobilization groups say getting people to take the final step of casting a ballot remains a critical concern.\n\n\"We don't have a registration problem. It's a turnout problem,\" says Kat Calvin of Spread the Vote, a group that helps eligible voters obtain IDs and provides education on how to vote. Calvin says that in Florida, for example, 86 percent of eligible voters were registered in 2016, but only 65 percent actually went to the polls. \"If you want to increase turnout you need to have people who have never voted before, they aren't always on an app,\" Calvin says.\n\n\"A lot of groups spend their time reaching out to the most marginalized people in America--socially, economically, education-wise--and don't necessarily do the follow up and get out the vote efforts to get them to the polls. We saw a ton of that in 2016,\" says Debra Cleaver, CEO and founder of Vote.org, which saw a significant spike in registrations earlier this month thanks to an Instagram post by Taylor Swift. \"Forty percent of non-voters are already registered, and they just need a push to get to the polls.\"\n\nThe clothing company Patagonia is giving its employees the day off in order to vote and plans to close its retail stores on Election Day, with the idea that \"voting is more important than shopping,\" says Corley Kenna, director of global communications and public relations for the company. \"Business has an important responsibility to help uphold democracy. The least we can do is make sure the employees of our company have that opportunity to exercise that right.\"\n\nPatagonia closed its stores in 2016, but has since been working with other companies to make public commitments to help get out the vote in the midterm. Last month, the company teamed up with Levi Strauss and Co. to launch the Time to Vote campaign, a coalition of businesses--including PayPal, Tyson Foods, and Walmart--aimed at increasing voter participation by giving employees time off to vote.\n\nOther companies like Spotify, TaskRabbit, and Survey Monkey have signed to the \"Take Off Election Day\" campaign, giving their employees the day off to vote.\n\nLevi's launched a television ad campaign urging voters to cast their ballots in the midterms and sending the messaging: \"It's your voice, it's your vote.\" The apparel company partnered with Rock the Vote to design t-shirts and jean jackets aimed at encouraging awareness about voting, and to help eligible voters register and sign up for election reminders. The company also partners with the group Headcount, which works to register voters at concerts and music festivals and keep them engaged in the process.\n\n\"It's about, how do we make it accessible and not push people away from a complicated process,\" says Aaron Ghitelman, communications director for Headcount, which has hosted over 1,500 registration drives this year.\n\nVoting groups say the best way to get out the vote is to make the process a social one. \"We've seen people moving their farmers market to a polling location,\" says Carolyn DeWitt, president and executive director of Rock the Vote. \"We want to make the voting experience social and communal, to make it into something that doesn't take away from their busy schedule. The idea you can meet your friends, go vote and go out for brunch...you can still have an impact by getting your friends together holding each other accountable and not going through the voting process alone.\"\n\nFor this year's midterm election, in addition to the group's traditional events, Rock the Vote is providing toolkits for people to host their own \"vote fest\" to integrate voting and discussion of voting into regular social gatherings.\n\nSocializing the voting process is the goal of the organization Vote Together, which helps voters plan ballot parties to help mobilize for the midterms. The group has also planned five larger scale events at polling locations in North Carolina and Florida to make voting like a celebration.\n\n\"We're trying to make celebrating Election Day like celebrating 4th of the July,\" says Angie Jean-Marie, the group's director. \"We held on to this idea that by creating more positive social dynamics when it comes to voting it helps increase turnout.\"", "QUEENSBURY, N.Y. - The owner of what's believed to be the nation's last Howard Johnson restaurant has been sentenced to six months in jail for sexually harassing employees.\n\nThe Post-Star of Glens Falls in upstate New York reports 65-year-old Jonathan LaRock, of Moreau, was sentenced Wednesday to six months in the Warren County Jail followed by six years' probation.

Now you'll never miss the trumpet!", "LAKE GROVE, N.Y. \u2014 A family mystery has been unsolved for decades: A father in New went missing in 1961 without a trace. Now, his grown children may get answers. The family found human remains when digging in their basement, CBS New York reports.\n\nMichael Carroll said he was a baby when his father, George Carroll, a Korean war veteran, disappeared. Since then, there have been hunches and what Michael calls \"funky stuff,\" like seeing ghosts in the house, which the Carroll family has owned since 1955.\n\nPolice said the family had always heard a rumor that he was buried in the basement, and a few months ago began to look into the hearsay. Michael Carroll recently hired a ground penetrating radar expert to check for disturbances under the house. Sure enough, family members began digging where the expert flagged, and this week found bones five feet under concrete in the basement.\n\n\"If it isn't him, I'd be surprised,\" Michael Carroll said about his father.\n\nHe is waiting for DNA confirmation, but said he hopes for answers he has sought his entire life.\n\n\"In my mind, I always felt like I was going to find that. I'm glad that this is over, and I'm glad that I don't have to break up my house anymore,\" he said. \"I feel great that my dad is free from that crappy hole. He's, I said to everybody, this is a Korean War hero who deserves to be acknowledged for his great \u2014 for doing what he's done. He was the father of four children, OK? It's crazy. So if that's the case and that's what's going on here, I'm glad that we gave him his day.\"\n\nIf it is his father, then comes the other half of the mystery: Who killed him?\n\nCarroll said he does not want to speculate, but hints at marital strife in his parents' breakup. A medical examiner will work to determine an official cause of death.\n\nCarroll's mother, Dorothy, died 20 years ago.\n\nMichael Carroll's brother Steven said that for years the children felt their father had simply abandoned them, and now they know he was with them all along.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "WASHINGTON - The Justice Department on Thursday charged companies in China and Taiwan, along with three individuals, with stealing trade secrets from a U.S. semiconductor company, a move that could heighten tensions with Beijing as the countries battle over trade issues.\n\nU.S. officials says the defendants, including a Chinese-owned company singled out this week by the Trump administration, targeted Idaho-based Micron over a technology it produces that stores memory in electronics. The Trump administration this week imposed restrictions on technology exports to one of the indicted companies, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co.\n\n\"The United States is standing up to the deliberate systematic and complicated threat posed to us around the world and in particular by the communist regime in China, which is notorious around the world for intellectual property theft,\" U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a press conference to announce the indictments, calling the alleged theft from Micron a \"brazen scheme.\"\n\nThe accused individuals face up to 15 years in prison and $5 million in fines, while the companies could incur up to $20 billion in financial penalties, Sessions added.\n\nThe administration has characterized China, along with Russia, as a strategic competitor of the United States. The U.S. has taken an increasingly tough and confrontational stance toward what it characterizes as China's \"predatory\" economic policies. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo set the tone in a June speech where he accused China of an \"unprecedented level of larceny\" of intellectual property.\n\nTensions over trade in particular have exacerbated relations between the two world powers. President Donald Trump has slapped tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese products in an effort to narrow the U.S. trade deficit with China. Those steps are also motivated by suspicions of China's plan to transform itself into a global leader in robotics, artificial intelligence and other technology industries. China has retaliated with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American products.\n\nThe tensions have extended into security issues. China has strongly criticized U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and the U.S. has renewed its criticism of Beijing's island-building in the disputed South China Sea. Trump has opened up a new line of criticism in recent weeks, accusing China of meddling in U.S. elections but without presenting substantive evidence of interference.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday, Trump said he had spoken with China President Xi Jinping. Trump said the two talked about many topics, but mostly about trade. He said U.S.-China discussions on trade are \"moving along nicely\" with a meeting being scheduled at the G-20 summit in Argentina, which begins late this month.\n\nBut the tough rhetoric used to announce the indictments today could hinder efforts to reach agreement on trade.\n\n\"Chinese espionage against the U.S. has been increasing and has been increasing rapidly,\" Sessions said. \"We are here today to say enough is enough. We are not going to take it anymore. It is unacceptable. It is time for China to join the community of lawful nations.\"\n\nMichael Hirson, an analyst with the Eurasia Group, thinks the U.S. and China face major hurdles in easing their trade conflict.\n\n\"Sessions' announcement today of an indictment of Fujian Jianhua Integrated Circuit Co. is another demonstration of the Trump administration's government-wide strategy to counter China virtually across the board, but especially in areas related to technology,\" Hirson said in a note.", "When your teenager is pining for her first car, forget what you've heard about the \"safest\" vehicles. Instead buy a car with some size and weight to it. The old faithful aging in grandma's garage may be a better bargain in terms of keeping young drivers safe than newer and cuter models, according to a new report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n\nNotably, IIHS, which evaluates auto safety, is doing a sharp left turn from some of its earlier research. As recently as July it rated the Kia Forte as one of the safest small cars on the road. But when it comes to the all-important first set of wheels for your novice teen driver, the organization used a different yardstick, assuming that parents and youngsters on a limited budget prefer to spend less than $20,000 for a vehicle.\n\nThis made the choice fairly simple. \"Bigger vehicles provide greater protection,\" said Vice President Jessica Cicchino, who's in charge of research for IIHS. \"If you're riding in one of the smallest vehicles on the road, you'll be at a disadvantage with almost any other vehicle around you.\"\n\nTo prove this, IIHS smashed a Kia Forte -- its 2018 top safety pick -- into a midsized Kia Sorento SUV; the same faceoff was staged between a 2018 Toyota Yaris minicar and the larger Toyota Avalon. In both crash tests the vehicles were traveling at 40 miles per hour, with half of the smaller car's width overlapping the larger vehicle. The weight of the larger autos was about 1,000 pounds more in both cases.\n\nIIHS focused on injuries to the drivers, which were crash dummies that ended up with a \"high likelihood\" of head trauma. Right leg injuries were also likely in the Forte and possible in the Yaris. Neck and chest injuries were possible in both vehicles, the tests showed. By contrast, both the Avalon and Sorento had \"good structural performance\" in the paired crashes, said the IIHS.\n\nThe insurance institute focused on teen drivers because they generally have less money to spend on their first car and have worse driver records than older drivers. Half of all teens will be involved in a car crash before they graduate high school, according to the National Safety Council and, in most instances, insurers will have to pay claims for these injuries. IIHS, which is sponsored by auto insurers, wants to keep insurance companies' costs and driver premiums down.\n\nIIHS offered a list of the safest used cars for teens, based on price tag and insurance losses. It also added data from its previous safety tests, such as what would happen when a vehicle hits a telephone pole. Small cars by definition were excluded from the list, as were vehicles with high horsepower.\n\nIn the \"under $20,000\" category for midsize cars, Volkswagen and Volvo models came out on top. Only two American models, both made by Ford, made the list. For large cars, U.S. cars did slightly better, but once again Volvo topped the list.\n\nIn the under $10,000 group, Volkswagen headed the list with three models in the midsize category, while the Buick LaCrosse and Ford Taurus were the safest large cars, IIHS concluded.", "Actor Michael B. Jordan is making a final push to encourage people to vote in the November 6 midterm elections. The \"Black Panther\" star has been going door to door in Atlanta, urging black people in particular to turn out and vote.\n\nJordan posted a video on Instagram showing his trek around the city Wednesday. He's canvasing with the group Voting While Black, which produced the video.\n\n\"It's crunch time. Everybody's gotta get out and vote,\" Jordan said in the video. Some local residents were in shock when the star knocked on their door.\n\n\"Oh my God! Wakanda forever,\" one fan said when she saw Jordan on her porch.\n\n\"This midterm election, exercising your right to vote is important as ever,\" Jordan says in the video. \"I know some of you think that your vote doesn't matter but you're actually some of the most important voters in the country.\"\n\n\"Your vote will help elect officials who can help make decisions on important issues like police brutality, criminal justice reform, and racial justice,\" the star said. \"So please, join me in Color to Change PAC, and vote on November 6.\"\n\nRapper T.I. has also recently campaigned with Voting While Black, visiting a barbershop in Miami. Producer and director Ava DuVernay created a video for the group urging people to vote. These efforts are a project of Color Of Change PAC, which describes itself on its website as \"a Political Action Committee focused on building independent Black political power, amplifying Black voices, electing candidates who share our values, and holding them accountable to our communities.\"\n\nJordan's Instagram post also included a number for people to text if they are interested in joining the movement.", "The video shows a Latino man in court, smiling menacingly. And his words are clear: He's killed cops and he's \"gonna kill more cops soon.\"\n\nThe man in the video, Luis Bracamontes, is an immigrant in the country illegally who was convicted this year of murdering two law enforcement officials. His image \u2014 complete with shaved head, long chin hair and accented English \u2014 is now the centerpiece of a video tweeted out by President Trump as part of his closing argument on immigration less than a week before midterm elections that could alter the path of his presidency.\n\nIt is unclear who created, or paid for the ad. The tweet is pinned to the top of the president's Twitter page so as to be prominent.\n\nThe expletive-filled video was immediately denounced by some Democrats and Republicans alike as racist. Retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake called it \"sickening.\"\n\n\"This is a sickening ad. Republicans everywhere should denounce it,\" Arizona's Flake, a frequent critic of the president, tweeted.\n\nIt comes amid a frenzy of hardline immigration proposals pushed out by Mr. Trump in the final stages of the campaign, including sending troops to the border and revoking birthright citizenship.\n\nThe video, which Mr. Trump tweeted late Wednesday, alleges without evidence that Democrats were responsible for allowing Bracamontes into the U.S., and for allowing him to stay. Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico, was sentenced to death in California for the 2014 killings.\n\nThe 53-second spot includes expletives uttered by Bracamontes during his trial as he professed regret at not killing more officers. CBS News is not posting the video here because of the language used.\n\n\"Illegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!,\" the video states, adding, \"Democrats let him into our country ... Democrats let him stay.\" It includes scenes of a migrant caravan moving toward the U.S., warning ominously, \"Who else would Democrats let in?\"\n\nBracamontes was also featured in a January ad from the Trump campaign that received less attention.\n\nThe ad was reminiscent of the infamous \"Willie Horton\" ad used against Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 and condemned as racist. Horton, who was black, raped a woman while out of prison on a weekend furlough. As Massachusetts governor, Dukakis supported the furlough program. Dukakis went on to lose to Republican George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe video tweeted by Mr. Trump did not immediately appear to be running on television, although it received extensive coverage on cable news networks. As of Thursday morning, it had received 2.65 million views in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe White House and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comments as to who made or paid for the video or if any tax dollars were used to run it from the president's account. It stood in stark contrast to an ad circulated by the Trump campaign earlier in the week that highlighted rosy economic numbers and depicted gauzy scenes of American suburban life.\n\nTom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, called the new ad the \"dog whistle of all dog whistles.\"\n\n\"This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,\" Perez said on CNN. \"This is fear-mongering.\"\n\nAl Cardenas, former head of the American Conservative Union, tweeted at Trump: \"You are a despicable divider; the worse social poison to afflict our country in decades. This ad, and your full approval of it, will condemn you and your bigoted legacy forever in the annals of America's history books.\"\n\nThe president is expected to make an announcement at the White House Thursday afternoon saying migrants who attempt to cross the border between points of entry will no longer be able to request asylum, as the president continues to double down on his immigration rhetoric.

Barely counted in life, these migrants rarely register in death \u2014 almost as if they never lived at all.\n\nA growing number of migrants have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what on earth happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries in South Africa's Gauteng province, or in the coastal Tunisian town of Zarzis. Similar cemeteries dot Italy, Greece and Libya.\n\nAn Associated Press tally has documented more than 56,800 migrants dead or missing worldwide since 2014 -- almost double the number found in the world's only official attempt to try to count them, by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. The IOM toll as of Oct. 1 was more than 28,500. The AP came up with almost 28,300 additional dead or missing migrants by compiling information from other international groups, forensic records, missing persons reports, death records, and examining data from thousands of interviews with migrants.\n\nThe AP's tally is also certainly an undercount. Bodies lie undiscovered in desert sands or at the bottom of the sea. And families don't always report loved ones as missing because they migrated illegally, or because they left home without saying exactly where they were headed.\n\nInstead, families are caught between hope and mourning, like that of Safi al-Bahri. Her son, Majdi Barhoumi, left their hometown of Ras Jebel, Tunisia, on May 7, 2011 for Europe in a small boat with a dozen other migrants. The boat sank and Barhoumi hasn't been heard from since. In a sign of faith that he is alive, his mother and father built an animal pen with a brood of hens, a few cows and a dog to stand watch until he returns.\n\n\"I just wait for him. I always imagine him behind me, at home, in the market, everywhere,\" said al-Bahri. \"When I hear a voice at night, I think he's come back. When I hear the sound of a motorcycle, I think my son is back.\"\n\nThe official U.N. toll extensively documents deaths in the Mediterranean and Europe, but even there cases fall through the cracks. The political tide is turning against migrants in Europe just as in the United States, where the government is cracking down heavily on caravans of Central Americans trying to get in. One result is that money is drying up for projects to track migration and its costs.\n\nSanti Palacios/AP\n\nFor example, when more than 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Europe's deadliest migrant sea disaster, Italian investigators pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work has been cut off.\n\nBeyond Europe, information is even more scarce. Even in the U.S., where migration has turned into a hot-button issue, there is no routine effort to figure out where migrants may disappear or die, nor a policy on identifying bodies and notifying families. And little is known about the toll in South America, where the Venezuelan migration is among the world's biggest today, and in Asia, the top region for numbers of migrants.\n\nAriana Cubillos/AP\n\nThe result is that governments vastly underestimate the true toll of migration, a major political and social issue in most of the world today.\n\n\"No matter where you stand on the whole migration management debate ... these are still human beings on the move,\" said Bram Frouws, the head of the Mixed Migration Centre, which has done surveys of more than 20,000 migrants in its 4Mi project since 2014. \"Whether it's refugees or people moving for jobs, they are human beings.\"\n\nThe missing include children, although once again the scant data is only in Europe. Some 2,773 children have been reported to the Red Cross as missing en route to Europe, and 2,097 adults reported missing by children.\n\nAlmass and his brother, both migrants from Khost, Afghanistan, are not on the list. He was just 14 when his widowed mother reluctantly sent him and his 11-year-old brother from their home into the unknown. The payment for their trip was supposed to get them away from the Taliban and all the way to Germany via a chain of smugglers.\n\nBut when the Iranian border police fired on their group, Almass lost hold of his brother's hand and went unconscious as he tumbled down a ravine. He never saw his brother again. When he next spoke to his mother, he couldn't bring himself to tell her; instead, he lied that his brother couldn't come to the phone but sent his love.\n\nThe family phone number in Afghanistan no longer works, their village is overrun with Taliban, and he has no idea how to find them -- or the child whose hand slipped from his grasp four years ago.\n\n\"I don't know now where they are,\" he said, his face anguished as he sat on a sun-dappled bench in rural France. \"They also don't know where I am.\"", "A soldier says a stranger\u2019s Christmas card got him through Vietnam.

Brown's novels have been translated into 56 different languages and have sold 220 million copies worldwide. Now, he's ready to share the secrets behind his own writing process.\n\nBrown is joining online educational platform, MasterClass, where experts offer classes in their specialty ranging from cooking with Gordon Ramsay to photography with Annie Leibovitz. Brown is teaching a course on how to write thrillers.\n\nAs he told \"CBS This Morning\" on Thursday, teaching is in his blood.\n\n\"I grew up on the campus of a prep school. My dad was a teacher, my mom was a teacher. Teachers were my heroes. I always thought of teaching as the noblest of all professions and so the chance to come back and do it in a platform like MasterClass.com, absolutely amazing,\" Brown said.\n\nHe hopes to offer more than the kind of advice that's often given to young writers like \"show don't tell\" and \"write what you know,\" which he admits is true, but not necessarily very helpful. He almost didn't agree to do the class because of that fear.\n\n\"I want to make sure that I can create a class that's actually helpful, that somebody can watch and say, 'You know what, these are the specific elements that make up stories. And now after seeing this class I have a sense of how to write a story myself,'\" he said.\n\nAnother misguided notion about writing he's ready to dispel is the need to write in a sacred space. He says he wrote the outline for the \"The Da Vinci Code\" in his parents' laundry room.\n\n\"The reality is writing takes place in your head and you don't need to be quite so precious about your space. I know people who have written bestselling novels in the front seat of their car in the garage on a laptop,\" he said.\n\nAnd the very first thing he tells students? \"Write like nobody's watching because, guess what? Nobody's watching.\"\n\nBrown's course on how to write a thriller costs $90 or $180 for access to the entire MasterClass catalogue.", "Here's some welcome news for people putting money away for retirement: The IRS has raised the 2019 contribution limits for various types of retirement savings accounts and for health savings accounts. If you participate in a 401(k) or similar plan, you should keep the new limits in mind as you think about your cash flow and financial planning for next year.\n\nEmployer-sponsored plans\n\nThe annual limit on contributions in 2019 for tax-advantaged plans such as 401(k), 403(b), 457 and so on is $19,000, up from the current limit of $18,500. And if you're age 50 or older at any time during the year (even if your 50th birthday falls on Dec. 31), you can also make additional catch-up contributions of an additional $6,000, for a total annual contribution of $25,000.\n\nSelf-employed 401(k) plans\n\nPeople who are self-employed can also set up and fund their own 401(k) profit-sharing plan, which allows for the same contribution limits as above. The self-employed can make two kinds of contributions to these plans: the employee's contribution and the employer's profit-sharing contribution. This type of plan is easy to set up at any major brokerage firm, and the contributions reduce your adjusted gross income, which results in considerable tax savings.\n\nFor an individual who declares about $80,000 in net profit from self-employment, the total pretax contribution is about $33,900 in 2019. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute about $39,900. If you're 50 or older and make a profit of $196,000 or more in 2019, the maximum pretax contribution is $62,000, which is also the maximum annual contribution to this type of plan.\n\nIRA plans\n\nThe new limit for contributions to IRAs for those under age 50 with earned income from wages is increased to $6,000 from $5,500. This limit applies to any type of IRA in 2019. Those 50 and older in 2019 can make an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000, for a total annual contribution of $7,000.\n\nThe IRS also announced that it increased all income limits used in determining eligibility to make deductible contributions to traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs and even for claiming the Savers Credit.\n\nSingle taxpayers who are eligible to participate in a workplace retirement plan are also eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA if their adjusted gross income is below $64,000 ($103,000 for marrieds) in 2019. This is up from $63,000 (singles) and $101,000 (marrieds) in 2018. This deduction is phased out when AGI is between $64,000 and $74,000 (singles) and $103,000 to $123,000 (marrieds).\n\nThe income range for making contributions to a Roth IRA in 2019 is $122,000 to $137,00 (singles and heads of households) and $193,000 to $203,000 (marrieds).\n\nThe 2019 income limit for the Savers Credit (also called the retirement savings contributions tax credit), which is for low- to middle-income workers who contribute to a retirement plan or IRA, is $64,000 for married workers (up from $63,000), $48,000 for heads of households and $32,000 for single filers (up from $31,500).\n\nHealth savings accounts\n\nThe 2019 annual HSA contribution limit for individuals with single medical coverage is $3,500, an increase of $50 from 2018. The limit is $7,000 for those covered under qualifying family plans (up from $6,900 in 2018). But if you're 55 or older in 2019, you can contribute an additional $1,000 annually, or $4,500 total to an HSA for singles and $8,000 for families.\n\nIf you're enrolled in a high-deductible health plan, you really should take advantage of this special savings opportunity. Make it a point to set aside pretax money into an HSA because you don't pay taxes on the earnings, which can also be withdrawn tax-free in retirement when used to reimburse yourself for qualified medical expenses.", "President Trump claimed his administration is finalizing a plan to only allow asylum seekers to apply at designated points of entry at the border, as he continues to push immigration issues ahead of the midterm elections next week.\n\nCurrently, those who don't go to an official checkpoint are still afforded a chance to wait for trial and make their case.\n\nThe president also said the military will not tolerate violence at the border, and any rocks thrown at the military will be treated like \"a firearm.\"\n\n\"Anybody throwing stones, rocks -- like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military, Mexican police, where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico -- we will consider that a firearm,\" he said.\n\nWhen a reporter asked him about this, the president said he has told the U.S. military to \"consider it a rifle.\"\n\n\"We will consider that the maximum that we can consider that, because they're throwing rocks viciously and violently,\" he said. \"You saw that three days ago.

Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he will send up to 15,000 troops to the border, he has threatened to end aid to some Central American countries, and in an interview that Axios aired Tuesday, he said he intends to end birthright citizenship by executive order.\n\n\"Birthright citizenship is a very very important subject,\" the president said Wednesday, as he was leaving for Florida. \"In my opinion it's much less complex than people think. I think it says it very loud and clear in the Constitution that you don't have to go through the process of whatever they're talking about.\"\n\n\"And by the way this is not a constitutional amendment -- you do not need a constitutional amendment for birthright citizenship,\" he told reporters. \"I believe you can have a simple vote in Congress or it's even possible, in my opinion -- this is after meeting with some very talented scholars -- that you can do it through an executive order.\" And he added, \"Now I'd rather do it through Congress because that's permanent.\"\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV.

Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine find that laparoscopic surgery, a less invasive procedure that involves a small incision in the abdomen, led to a higher risk of death from cervical cancer compared to patients who had a traditional hysterectomy.\n\nIn fact, after the less-invasive surgery the cancer was four times more likely to return.\n\nIn light of the results, the researchers say it is no longer appropriate for doctors to perform laparoscopic surgery to treat cervical cancer.\n\n\"At this point, we would recommend only using open surgery to perform a radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer,\" co-senior author Dr. Shohreh Shahabi, chief of gynecologic oncology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine physician, said in a statement.\n\nSome hospitals, including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Maryland and MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, have now switched back to the traditional type of surgery.\n\nLess-invasive surgery means shorter hospitalization stays and less risk of infection, CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus explains. Open surgery is performed with a large incision in the middle of the abdomen and recovery from this surgery generally requires several days in the hospital.\n\nAgus says doctors don't know exactly why higher death and recurrence rates were seen in this study, but there are a few theories.\n\n\"We think it's somehow how you manipulate the tissue when you do this, or the fact that you have to blow up the abdomen with air while you do the surgery so you can see things,\" he told \"CBS This Morning.\" \"One of those actually causes the cancer to behave differently. We're seeing here a negative effect on patients and it's pretty scary.\"\n\nThe FDA regulates medical technology but not how it is used. Agus says as a result, the medical community needs \"to take a step back and wait for studies to show that it's safe and the outcome is right before we use technologies in patients across the country.\"\n\n\"There's a move now to do things quicker with technology. We have to step back and say does this make sense for the cancer,\" he continued. \"Obviously, if you're a patient, you want the best cancer outcome.

But there has been no public indication that federal prison officials have taken action to address the safety concerns, even as Bulger's killing marks the third at the facility in the last six months.\n\nAn independent government commission found that United States Penitentiary Hazelton, near the state's border with Maryland in Bruceton Mills, has been overcrowded for years. Inmates have repeatedly expressed concerns about their safety at the high-security prison, which houses 1,270 male inmates. A 2016 report from the District of Columbia's Corrections Information Council said that prisoners warned officials, \"Inmates can lose their lives quickly here.\"\n\nAccording to news reports, the penitentiary has garnered a grim nickname among inmates: \"Misery Mountain.\"\n\nCBS News\n\nIn April, 48-year-old Ian Thorne was killed during an altercation with a fellow prisoner, and in September, Demario Porter was also killed in another fight with a fellow inmate.\n\nCourt records, oversight reports and news articles detail numerous violent incidents in recent years. In 2016, an inmate was charged with murder after prosecutors said he strangled another prisoner to death during a fight. In February 2015, an inmate stabbed a fellow prisoner with a hand-crafted weapon during a fight, according to court documents. Another inmate received an extended sentence in May for assaulting a fellow prisoner and possessing a deadly weapon.\n\n\"There are a multitude of federal prisons that don't have a homicide rate like that,\" said Cameron Lindsay, a former federal prison warden who now works as a jail security consultant.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Prisons has not responded to requests for comment about safety concerns at USP Hazelton.\n\nLast week, five members of Congress wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about what they called \"dangerous continual understaffing\" at federal prisons in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and stated their alarm about the deaths at USP Hazelton.\n\nJustice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said DOJ was \"aware of the concerns raised in the letter\" and would respond to the members of Congress.\n\nIn a separate letter this month, the District of Columbia's House delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, asked the Justice Department's inspector general to launch an investigation into the conditions at USP Hazelton, citing Thorne and Porter's deaths. Holmes Norton said she had also heard about the \"brutal treatment\" of inmates at the prison and was concerned that the incidents \"may be indicative of larger, ongoing problems at the facility.\"\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Norton said Bulger's death \"underscores reports of a culture of violence at Hazelton.\"\n\nNorton's office said she had not received a response to her earlier letter, and John Lavinsky, a spokesman for the inspector general, declined to comment.\n\nThe 89-year-old Bulger, who benefited from a corrupt relationship with the FBI before spending 16 years as one of America's most wanted men, was found unresponsive Tuesday morning, just hours after he arrived at USP Hazelton. He was declared dead shortly afterward. Authorities have not released a cause of death, but prosecutors said it was being investigated as a homicide. Sources tell CBS News he was apparently beaten to death, and the Boston Globe reported Bulger's eyes were nearly gouged out.\n\nA Mafia hit man, Fotios \"Freddy\" Geas, who is said to hate \"rats,\" and at least one other inmate are believed to have been involved in Bulger's killing, an ex-investigator briefed on the case said Wednesday. The longtime investigator was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nDon Treeger /The Republican via AP\n\nGeas, 51, and his brother were sentenced to life in prison in 2011 for their roles in several violent crimes, including the 2003 killing of Adolfo \"Big Al\" Bruno, a Genovese crime family boss who was gunned down in a Springfield, Massachusetts, parking lot.\n\nThe case hung largely on the testimony of several gangsters turned government informants, reports MassLive. The brothers reportedly refused to cooperate as co-conspirators who did received lighter sentences.\n\nPrivate investigator Ted McDonough, who knew Geas, told The Boston Globe: \"Freddy hated guys who abused women. Whitey was a rat who killed women. It's probably that simple,\" McDonough told the newspaper, which first reported that Geas was under suspicion.\n\nBulger led a largely Irish mob that ran loan-sharking, gambling and drug rackets. He also was an FBI informant who ratted on the New England mob, his gang's main rival, in an era when bringing down the Mafia was a top priority for the FBI. Tipped off that he was about to be indicted, Bulger became a fugitive and eluded authorities for nearly two decades before being captured in 2011. He was convicted in 2013 in a sweeping racketeering indictment -- including on counts he participated in 11 murders -- and was sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\nIt's not clear why he was transferred.\n\n\"What I don't understand is why the Federal Bureau of Prisons would transfer a super high-publicity inmate, who is a known snitch, to general population of a high-security prison. You've got to be smarter than that,\" Lindsay, the former warden, said.\n\nCBS Boston\n\nUnion officials say the prison is operating at about 75 percent of its staffing level and has dozens of vacant positions. They have also decried a practice known as augmentation, which taps health care workers, teachers, secretaries and prison cooks to fill correction officer positions because of officer shortages and overtime limits.\n\nJustin Tarovisky, executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 420, which represents Hazelton prison guards, said Bulger's death \"outlines how dangerous this prison is.\" The union voiced its concerns about staffing in a picket outside the prison as far back as 2015.\n\nThe letter sent to Sessions last week by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; Pat Toomey, R-Pa.; Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.; and Bob Casey, D-Pa.; and Rep. Bill Schuster, R-Pa., said Congress had provided additional funding to ensure there would be at least two corrections officers on duty in each housing unit for each shift and that the policy was \"not being enforced as intended.\" The legislators said they were concerned that the Bureau of Prisons hasn't followed Congress' direction to curtail \"its overreliance on augmentation, particularly in housing units.\"\n\nA hiring freeze imposed by the Trump administration has left the agency short-staffed and some already overloaded federal prisons have been housing immigration detainees in recent months as well.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, has pushed prison reform as a key priority, though others in the Trump administration - including Sessions - support the toughest possible sentences for drug and other convictions. Kushner has had an interest in prison reform since his own father, Charles Kushner, was incarcerated for 14 months after being convicted of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering.", "The Berlin Wall entered the history books in 1961.

Robert Bowers, 46, was arraigned one day after a grand jury issued a 44-count indictment that charges him with murder, hate crimes, obstructing the practice of religion and other crimes.\n\nIt was his second brief appearance in a federal courtroom since the weekend massacre at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Bowers walked into the courtroom nodding toward the crowd and making eye contact with observers, CBS News correspondent David Begnaud reports.\n\n\"Yes!\" Bowers said in a loud voice when asked if he understood the charges. He asked for a jury trial.\n\nAuthorities say Bowers raged against Jews during and after the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history. He remains jailed without bail.\n\nBowers, who was shot and wounded during a gunbattle that injured four police officers, walked into court under his own power, his left arm heavily bandaged. He was in a wheelchair at his first court appearance on Monday.\n\nBowers, who is stocky and square-faced with salt-and-pepper, closely cropped hair, frowned as the charges were read but did not appear to have a reaction as a federal prosecutor announced he could face a death sentence. He told a prosecutor he had read the indictment.\n\nOne of his federal public defenders, Michael Novara, said Bowers pleaded not guilty, \"as is typical at this stage of the proceedings.\"\n\nBowers had been set for a preliminary hearing on the evidence, but federal prosecutors instead took the case to a grand jury. The panel issued the indictment as funerals continued for the victims.\n\nJared Younger of Los Angeles told mourners that he waited for hours Saturday for his father to pick up his phone or let them know he was all right. The dread built all day until his sister learned their father, Irving Younger, had indeed been shot and killed.\n\n\"That waiting stage was just unbearable,\" Jared Younger said at his father's funeral Wednesday. \"Saturday was the most lonely day of my life.\"\n\nFunerals were being held Thursday for Bernice and Sylvan Simon, husband and wife, and Dr. Richard Gottfried, a dentist who worked part-time at a clinic treating refugees and immigrants. The oldest victim, 97-year-old Rose Mallinger, will be honored at the last service Friday.

He was one of the first people Rabbi Jeffrey Myers met when he came to town last year from New Jersey to lead Tree of Life.\n\nMyers, who survived the massacre, is presiding over five funerals for seven congregants this week. He ran a few minutes late to Younger's service because he was still at the burial for another victim, Joyce Fienberg.\n\n\"I can't imagine the stress he's under,\" said his predecessor, Rabbi Charles \"Chuck\" Diamond. As Younger's service was wrapping up, Myers momentarily forgot to read a letter to the family that another rabbi had sent.\n\n\"After preparing for five funerals, you get a little verklempt,\" Myers said.\n\nTree of Life remains a crime scene.

Most would also be willing to buy solar panels for their own use, and a plurality would be willing to pay an additional $5 a month to get energy from fully renewable sources, according to a survey from Consumer Reports.\n\nThe consumer advocacy group spoke with 1,200 Americans, including 400 residents of coal-reliant states: Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, and Virginia. Residents of those four states largely agreed with Americans as a whole, the organization found.\n\nOverall, 76 percent of respondents agreed with the statement, \"Increasing renewable energy (such as solar and wind) is a worthwhile goal.\" The response rate from Illinois, Tennessee and Virginia was within the survey's margin of error, while Ohio had the lowest rate, at 71 percent. (Major coal-producing states such as West Virginia and Wyoming did not have enough respondents to the poll to draw conclusions.)\n\nA majority of respondents also favored solar for themselves. Between 52 and 57 percent said they would be willing to pay for solar panels if they could recoup the investment within five years.\n\nThe time needed for a solar array to \"pay for itself\" depends greatly on the policies of a particular state and so can vary greatly across the country\u2014currently between four and 10 years in most parts of the country. That's not accounting for any effect solar has on home values, which some accounts say gets a boost from solar.\n\nFewer Americans said they would be willing to pay $5 more a month for energy that was 100 percent renewable. Residents of Virginia said they were willing to do so at a rate of 52 percent, higher than the other groups interviewed in the survey.\n\nThe results may be surprising to some, but they corroborate other recent polling on renewable energy. Last year, Pew found that two-thirds of Americans favor developing clean energy over fossil fuels\u2014a stance that extends to younger generations of Republicans.\n\nConsumer Reports plans to submit the survey results to the Environmental Protection Agency in response to its rollback of the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era regulation that sped up coal plant retirements, a spokesman for the group said.", "Every once in a while we come across a story of people trying to push the limits of what human beings can do. Athletes competing not just against each other, but against mother nature herself. When we first met a surfer named Garrett McNamara six years ago he had just set a world record for riding the biggest wave anyone ever had. Surfers from around the world have been trying to break McNamara's record ever since. As you're about to see someone finally has. Each winter big wave surfers bring their boards and their bravery to an unlikely spot where the waves can get as tall as buildings. It's not in Hawaii or Australia, it's off the coast of Portugal, in an ancient town called Nazar\u00e9, where Garrett McNamara first had the ride of his life.\n\nThe giant waves appear off Nazar\u00e9 every winter, just as they have for thousands of years. Few surfers knew about this place until 2011 when Garrett McNamara was towed into this 78-foot wave by a Jet Ski. He had a camera mounted on his surfboard, and one on the shore, recording him as he got into place, let go of the tow rope and began his record-setting ride.\n\nGarrett McNamara: I didn't realize it was that big of a wave until it came down from above and just boom right on my shoulders and it almost squashed me. I almost collapsed.\n\nAnderson Cooper: It's hard for people who have not ridden a 78-foot wave to understand what it feels like, the power of that wave. How do you describe it?\n\nGarrett McNamara: A lot of us have snowboarded or skied. Just imagine going as fast as you go down a mountain and then imagine hitting some ice, maybe some moguls. And then imagine an avalanche coming down after you. Then imagine not trying to run away from it, trying to stay as close as possible to it the whole time. And-- and have it ch-- chasing you and now the mountain's moving and-- and not just the avalanche, but the whole mountain is moving. That's what it's like riding these giant waves.\n\nAnderson Cooper: It sounds terrifying.\n\nGarrett McNamara: For the average person, could easily be hell.\n\nIf you haven't figured it out by now, Garrett McNamara is not your average person. He started focusing on big waves in the mid 90's, attracted by the challenge and the rush of adrenaline he got riding them. Before setting the world record he'd already made a name for himself with some incredible rides and some epic wipeouts.\n\nGarrett McNamara: I broke ribs, three different times. Broke feet, hurt this knee, back, stitches from head to toe.\n\nAnderson Cooper: How many times you been stitched up?\n\nGarrett McNamara: I don't know, at-- at least a hundred if not more. And-- and I-- I've stopped going to the doctor, I just use Crazy Glue now, so I just\u2014\n\nAnderson Cooper: You-- what?\n\nGarrett McNamara: Yeah. Yeah. I Crazy Glue everything. If I can Crazy Glue it, it's getting Crazy Glued. If you put it perfectly back together and put some Crazy Glue on it done. And back in the water that day.\n\n\"When you're underwater getting pounded, you are at the mercy of the ocean. You're like a grain of sand in the washing machine on spin cycle, going all different directions.\"\n\nMcNamara first surfed the waters off Nazar\u00e9, Portugal in 2010.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What did people think of you here?\n\nGarrett McNamara: I know in the beginning they thought I was absolutely crazy\u2026\n\nA local resident had emailed him this picture of a wave, hoping to attract surfers and boost the local economy.\n\nFor generations, Nazar\u00e9 was known as a sleepy fishing village. It was only the town's fishermen who braved these treacherous waters. Hundreds have drowned within sight of their loved ones on shore.\n\nWhen we first came here in 2012, there weren't many surfers riding these monster waves. Today, thanks in large part to Garrett McNamara, the water is now crowded with them. And onshore throngs of spectators gather around a 100-year-old lighthouse to watch the incredible rides and dangerous falls.\n\nGarrett McNamara: It's-- like Waterworld. Like-- dog fight for waves now. It's really funny.\n\nAnderson Cooper: People are competing for waves.\n\nGarrett McNamara: Yeah, competing, fighting. Yeah, full on.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Surfers wanna challenge themselves here in Nazar\u00e9.\n\nGarrett McNamara: This is-- the proving ground when it comes to a team. Much more about teamwork here. You need somebody with a Jet Ski to watch over you. And once it gets over 60 feet, everybody's challenging themself and their skills here.\n\nAnderson Cooper: It's dangerous even for the Jet Skiers.\n\nGarrett McNamara: Oh, the-- it's-- almost more dangerous because you got this big machine, all a sudden-- if a wave lands on you and you're stuck with the machine.\n\nLast November, McNamara was riding a Jet Ski, towing his friend, British surfer Andrew Cotton into this massive wave in Nazar\u00e9. It didn't go as planned.\n\nGarrett McNamara: This thing literally exploded like a bomb. And he flew into mid-air like a cannonball. He was a human cannonball.\n\nCotton was in the wrong spot on the wave, and had to jump off his board. He disappeared momentarily before being thrown forward like a rag doll. He landed hard on the water and broke his back.\n\nAndrew Cotton: The shock went through my back. It-- it was like hitting concrete.\n\nCotton was rescued and brought onto the beach. He spent months recovering, but is already back in Nazar\u00e9 surfing once again.\n\nAndrew Cotton: As wipeouts go, it wasn't really that bad.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Dude, you broke your back. I mean--\n\nAndrew Cotton: Yeah, but it was-- it was an impact. And-- and the thing is, is-- is the-- the amazing thing about Nazar\u00e9 is you never know what you're gonna get.\n\nThat's what makes Nazar\u00e9 so exciting. The same day Andrew Cotton got hurt, a Brazilian surfer named Rodrigo Koxa caught the ride of his life, on this wave that some observers thought might have broken Garrett McNamara's record.\n\nAnd just a few months later, another Brazilian surfer, Maya Gabeira set a new women's world record, on a wave that measured 68 feet.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Who do you think will be the next surfer to set a world record here?\n\nAndrew Cotton: There's a lot of capable people to set the next world record.\n\nWe wanted to see these world-famous waves up-close, so we rigged McNamara's Jet Ski with three mini-cameras and attached another to the end of a stick I could easily carry.\n\nWe also placed three cameras with high powered zoom lenses on the cliffs overlooking where the waves break and hired another cameraman, Jorge Leal, to follow us.\n\nWith eight cameras rolling and two Jet Skis, we took off from the harbor in Nazar\u00e9.\n\nAnderson Cooper: So this is the area you try to surf in?\n\nGarrett McNamara: Yeah.\n\nWe hoped to see for ourselves just how powerful and dangerous the waves here are.\n\nAnderson Cooper: I'm good.\n\nGarrett McNamara: Come right on up, hold on tight.\n\nWe had no idea what we were in for.\n\nGarrett McNamara: Woo Hoo! Look at that!\n\nMcNamara considered these waves relatively tame. They were only 20 to 30 feet high.\n\nGarrett McNamara: Wow, look at the rainbow! Rainbow! Look at that! Holy Moly! That's amazing. Now it's time to hold on.\n\nIt's not just the wind and the current that makes the waves here so massive; it's the existence of an underwater canyon. At its deepest point, the canyon is nearly three times the depth of the Grand Canyon. It starts about 100 miles off shore and runs nearly all the way onto shore.\n\nGarrett McNamara: All this energy and it funnels in like a V, so all this energy it comes down the canyon, and as soon as it hits a shallow point, kaboom!\n\nGetting hit with all that energy is according to McNamara part of the joy of big wave surfing. On this wave in Nazar\u00e9, he ditched his board to prevent it from hitting him. You can see McNamara as a little speck on the lip of the wave.\n\nThis is the view from the camera on his board.\n\nGarrett McNamara: A lip lands on me. I get obliterated. And I'm under forever. And I was just-- loving every bit of it. It was amazing.\n\nAnderson Cooper: The way you say, \"Obliterated,\" it's sort of blissful and sort-- it's a little weird. What's the enjoyment of getting obliterated, of getting wiped out?\n\nGarrett McNamara: I think it's-- you're-- just out-- there's-- out of control. Like, when you're riding a wave, you-- still in control somewhat. You're at the mercy of the wave, but you can choose your path and your destiny. When you're underwater getting pounded, you are at the mercy of the ocean. You're like a grain of sand in the washing machine on spin cycle, going all different directions. And--\n\nAnderson Cooper: And that loss of control is\u2026you feel alive.\n\nGarrett McNamara: Feel alive.\n\nBut two years ago McNamara's desire to feel alive, nearly cost him his life. It was in the Northern California surf spot known as Mavericks when he attempted to catch this wave which he thinks was 50-60 feet high.\n\nGarrett McNamara: I was in the perfect spot, paddled, stood up, thought I had it. And right when I hit, I was going so fast, it-- just-- broke my-- shattered my head, nine pieces.\n\nAnderson Cooper: The-\n\nGarrett McNamara: Humeru-- the humerus head shattered in nine pieces and broke the shaft off the head, where it lodged itself in my pec. It was--\n\nAnderson Cooper: Wait a minute. The bone lodged in your pec.\n\nMcNamara was rescued by a rider on a Jet Ski, and loaded into an ambulance.\n\nAnderson Cooper: When you went to see a doctor, what did they say?\n\nGarrett McNamara: The doctor-- they-- said I may ne-- might never surf again.\n\nAt home in Hawaii, his recovery was slow and excruciating. McNamara's shoulder had to be surgically reconstructed, with nine screws and a metal plate. He was bedridden for months.\n\nGarrett McNamara: I wanted to die. That's how bad the pain was.\n\nHis wife Nicole helped him through his rehabilitation, which took more than a year.\n\nMcNamara is 51 now and he and Nicole live in Portugal during the winter with their son.\n\nHe still feels the pain in his shoulder when he paddles. But he's back on the water and says he is a different person than he was before the accident.\n\nGarrett McNamara: You know the main thing it did is took the monkey off my back.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What do you mean?\n\nGarrett McNamara: I used to have to ride every single swell everywhere in the world, if I had the ability to get there, or I was on suicide watch.\n\nAnderson Cooper: You were always looking for the biggest wave.\n\nGarrett McNamara: Biggest, best, perfect. And now, the monkey jumped off. I can-- I can be sittin' at home in Hawaii and see the biggest swell of the year coming here and be so happy and just say, \"No, I'm happy right here.\"\n\nAnderson Cooper: It sounds like at 50, one of the biggest daredevils out there is growing up.\n\nGarrett McNamara: I don't wanna say I'm growing up, but I definitely feel content.\n\nThat may be just as well. Remember that wave Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa caught last November? After the World Surf League analyzed video and photographs they declared it was 80 feet tall. Two feet taller than Garrett McNamara's record-setting wave.\n\nMcNamara says he couldn't be happier for Koxa and for Nazar\u00e9 which remains in the record books. He may have lost his world record, but that same month he gained something much more important, a baby daughter. Her middle name is Nazar\u00e9.\n\nProduced by Keith Sharman.

Diamond and Erin Horan.", "", "", "", "Investors are hoping for a reset after October brought more tricks than treats.\n\nLast month brought a sudden, screeching halt to a milestone-setting September. October's slide snapped a six-month winning streak for the benchmark S&P 500 index, with October clocking in as the worst month for the market since September 2011.\n\nOn the first trading day of November, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 151 points, or 0.6 percent, in early trading.\n\nOn October 29, the S&P 500 narrowly missed closing in what Wall Street calls a correction \u2014 a drop of 10 percent or more from a recent high. The index ended the month down 7.5 percent from its all-time high set September 20 and down 6.9 percent for the month. The Nasdaq briefly entered into a correction before recouping some of its losses this week. The technology-heavy index finished October down 9.9 percent from the record set August 29 and down 9.2 percent for the month.\n\nThe market's reversal in October came as investors grew concerned that corporate profits, which drive stock market gains, could be poised to weaken.\n\n\"Investors were worried about politics and earnings,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for CFRA. \"Politics because of the upcoming midterm elections, as well as the China trade dispute ... And from an earnings perspective, investors started to worry about an earnings peak.\"\n\nWhile profits have been extremely strong this year \u2014 earnings for the S&P 500 are estimated to have risen by 24.8 percent in the third quarter after a 25.2 percent gain in the second quarter \u2014 several big companies, including Amazon, AT&T and Alphabet, reported quarterly earnings or revenue during the month that fell short of expectations. And some company executives warned of rising costs related to the U.S.-China tariffs and inflation \u2014 factors that could weigh on earnings next year.\n\n\"While nine of 11 sectors have seen increases in third-quarter estimates, an equal number \u2014 nine of 11 \u2014 have seen full-year 2019 earnings reductions,\" Stovall noted.\n\nInterest rate concerns\n\nThe disappointing company outlooks added to investors' jitters about the health of corporate America and the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates, and has indicated it's likely to continue doing so for the next two years. The escalating U.S.-China trade dispute is adding to some companies' costs, which could dampen profits. And on top of all that, an economic slowdown in China has traders worried about slower global economic growth.\n\nIn response, investors piled money into safe-haven, high-yield stocks like electric utility AES Corp. and household goods companies such as Hormel Foods.\n\nConsumer staples and utilities were the only sectors in the S&P 500 to eke out gains in October, of 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. The energy sector and consumer discretionary stocks, which includes companies such as Norwegian Cruise Line and Amazon.com, took some of the heaviest losses. Both sectors lost 11.3 percent for the month.\n\nAmazon plunged 20.2 percent in October. Netflix, another of this year's high fliers, lost 19.3 percent during the month as investors pocketed profits from the stock's gains this year.\n\nThree of the most valuable U.S. companies ended October in a correction: Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook, although some of those declines began this summer.\n\nConcerns that the U.S.-China trade dispute will drag on, hurting company profits, have made traders wary of investing in companies that depend on economic growth, like technology, industrial and consumer-focused firms \u2014 the same stocks that led the market over the last decade.\n\nSome of October's market volatility could also be attributed to uncertainty over the outcome of the midterm elections on November 6, although stocks finished out the month with a two-day rally.\n\n\"The question,\" Stovall said, \"is do you buy into this two-day rally or do you sell into this two-day rally?\"", "Russian investigators have traced the cause of the sudden Soyuz launch abort Oct. 11 that triggered a dramatic emergency escape for the Russian mission commander and his NASA co-pilot. Senior managers said Thursday the mishap was due to a \"deformed\" sensor in a system that controlled the separation of a strap-on first-stage booster from the rocket's central core stage.\n\nOleg Skorobogatov, who led the accident investigation, said the sensor was damaged during final assembly at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, adding the conclusion had been \"proven and confirmed.\" He did not say how the sensor was bent, only that it occurred during the rocket's assembly.\n\nSoyuz rockets being prepared for upcoming flights will be inspected to make sure no similar problems exist.\n\nA Soyuz rocket carrying a Russian Glonass navigation satellite is scheduled for launch Nov. 3 from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome north of Moscow and a another Soyuz, carrying the MetOp C weather satellite, is scheduled for launch Nov. 6 (EST) from Kourou, French Guiana.\n\nThe Russians then plan to launch a Progress space station supply ship from Baikonur on Nov. 16, one day after NASA and Northrup Grumman launch a station-bound Cygnus cargo capsule from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at Wallops Island, Virginia. The unpiloted Cygnus and Progress spacecraft will both reach the station on Nov. 18.\n\nAssuming those flights go well, the Russians will press ahead with plans to launch the next piloted Soyuz on Dec. 3, carrying commander Oleg Kononenko, Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques and NASA astronaut Anne McClain on a flight to the International Space Station.\n\nNASA\n\nThe space station's current crew -- Expedition 57 commander Alexander Gerst, NASA astronaut Serena Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor and cosmonaut Sergey Prokopyev -- originally planned to return to Earth on Dec. 13. They now plan to come home a week later, on Dec. 20.\n\nBefore Prokopyev returns to Earth, he and Kononenko plan to carry out a spacewalk Dec. 11 to inspect the Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft that carried the Gerst crew into orbit June 6. A small leak in the spacecraft's upper habitation module was found and fixed in August and Russian engineers want to find out how extensive the damage might have been.\n\nThey also want to learn more about whether it was caused by a deliberate act at some point during the spacecraft's processing, as suggested at one point by Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos.\n\nThe Oct. 11 launch abort was the first such mishap for the normally reliable Soyuz rocket since September 1983, when two cosmonauts narrowly escaped a launch pad explosion. The only other Soyuz launch abort occurred in April 1975 when two other cosmonauts were forced to make an emergency landing after a different sort of stage separation problem.\n\nGiven the long history of the rocket and its systems, analysis of telemetry and examination of wreckage, Russian investigators were able to quickly identify what went wrong in the most recent mishap.\n\nDuring a news conference in Moscow Thursday, dramatic launch video was released showing how the Soyuz FG's central second stage quickly lost control after one of the rocket's four strap-on first-stage boosters crashed into the core.\n\nRoscosmos\n\nSoyuz MS-10 commander Alexey Ovchinin and NASA astronaut Nick Hague were slammed back in their seats as the spacecraft's flight computer triggered an automatic abort, firing rockets that rapidly pulled the crew capsule away. Arcing over on a now-ballistic trajectory, the crew made a steeper-than-normal descent, enduring about seven times the normal force of gravity before landing safely about 250 miles downrange.\n\nOvchinin returned to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City near Moscow while Hague eventually flew home to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\nIt is not known when they might get a second chance to complete their space station mission, but NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Rogozin have both promised to work Ovchinin and Hague back into the crew rotation.\n\nBecause of the launch abort, the Russians were forced to launch Kononenko's crew ahead of schedule. By taking off in the first week of December, the new crew will have time to carry out an orderly handover before helping Gerst and his crewmates depart Dec. 20. The Gerst crew must leave by early January at the latest or their Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft will exceed its on-orbit certification.\n\nWith the departure of Gerst, Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor and Prokopyev, Kononenko's crew will have the station to themselves until April when another Soyuz crew is scheduled for takeoff.\n\nThe original flight plan called for Oleg Skripochka, NASA astronaut Christina Koch and a United Arab Emirates guest astronaut to take off on April 5. The UAE astronaut then would have returned to Earth about 10 days later with Hague and Ovchinin. Thanks to the launch abort, it's not yet known who will fly up to the station next spring or how the flights will be sequenced.\n\nIn the near term, NASA hopes to press ahead with launch of a Northrup Grumman Cygnus cargo ship atop an Antares booster from Virginia in mid November followed by launch of a SpaceX Dragon supply craft atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral on Dec. 4, the day after Kononenko's crew takes off from Baikonur.\n\nTwo NASA spacewalks to install a second set of batteries for the space station's solar power system are on hold. The Japanese HTV cargo ship that brought the batteries up to the station in September will return to Earth Nov. 7. It originally was to carry the old batteries away from the station, but they will have to be discarded later.", "NEW YORK -- A rare duck is causing a stir in New York City.

That's the thing that is getting people's imaginations fired. ... It's the most beautiful duck, probably in the world,\" he said.\n\nBarrett said he's checked with every zoo in the city and none are missing a duck. It leads the bird-watching community to believe it was a domestic pet, which is illegal in New York City.\n\n\"It might have got away or someone might have got tired of it and dumped it,\" Barrett said.\n\nIt also may have flown to Manhattan from a neighboring town.\n\nThe city doesn't plan on removing the duck unless it appears to be unhealthy or in danger. Bird experts said they don't think the duck will migrate for the winter, but it should survive.", "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts.\n\n\"1234\" \u2013 Feist\n\n\"King of Anything\" \u2013 Sara Bareilles\n\n\"Dirty Water\" \u2013 Foo Fighters\n\n\"Hold Back The River\" \u2013 James Bay\n\n\"Tongue Tied\" \u2013 Grouplove\n\n\"Call Me In The Afternoon\" \u2013 Half Moon Run\n\n\"Ladies First\" \u2013 Queen Latifah, Monie Love\n\n\"Little Talks\" \u2013 Of Monsters and Men\n\n\"Believe\" \u2013 Mumford & Sons\n\n\"Canto Della Terra\" \u2013 Andrea Bocelli\n\n\"Trip Switch\" \u2013 Nothing But Thieves\n\n\"High Hopes\" \u2013 Panic!

Caught in a six-year slump, they're struggling economically as robust crop yields, driven by advances in technology, have slashed prices -- and farm incomes.\n\nFarmers' net income has tumbled 40 percent since the 2013 high, according to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. And with 20 percent of commodities sold overseas, the strong dollar and recent tariffs by the Trump administration have further dampened sales.\n\nBut the rural economy was floundering even before President Donald Trump embarked on his aggressive trade policies, and things aren't expected to improve anytime soon. Production of corn and soybean will reach record levels this year, as favorable weather conditions and innovations in biotechnology and engineering increase yields. That has pushed down the price for those crops to nearly 10-year lows, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.\n\n\"Large harvests can improve cash flow for agricultural producers in the short term,\" said Nathan Kauffman, lead economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and a co-author of the St. Louis Fed report. \"But they can hurt profitability going forward because of lower prices.\"\n\nWhile commodity prices have declined, costs -- particularly for land and machinery -- have stayed high, said David Kohl, professor emeritus of agricultural and applied economics at Virginia Tech. The resulting cash flow and margin squeeze are punishing balance sheets, he said.\n\nFarming has simply become too efficient, Kohl said. Of the country's 2 million farms, about 10 percent to 12 percent generate 80 percent of total production.\n\n\"This is an economic reset for the farm economy that I call 'the grinder,'\" Kohl said. \"The farm economy hasn't crashed like it did in the 1980s, but it has slowed down and it just won't quit. That's really placing a financial and emotional toll on farms, ranchers, bankers and the agribusiness sector in general.\"\n\nThe main reason the farm economy hasn't imploded completely: Land values have stayed strong, Kohl said. While land isn't a liquid asset, farmers can use it as collateral to refinance bank loans to cover operating expenses.\n\n\"Some farmers since 2013 have refinanced three times to maintain liquidity,\" Kohl said. \"The critical element of why agriculture isn't in a depression, or major recession, is because land values have held up so far.\"\n\nAnd it's baby boomer farms that have the most land equity, given years of appreciation. Baby boomers are farming well into their 70s because technology reduces physical labor demand.\n\nAgricultural bankers across the Midwest are reporting elevated demand for farm loans, the Kansas City Fed's Kauffman said. \"There has been a modest decrease in the farmers' ability to repay loans because of reduced profitability,\" he added.\n\nBumper crops around the world\n\nWhile good weather factors into yields, technology is a major component in the abundance of crops, Kohl said. For example, advances in biotech mean seeds yield more crops and plants are more disease-resistant. This is also happening in other countries, like Brazil, allowing them to produce more as well. The agriculture market is global, so abundant harvests around the world affect U.S. prices, he said.\n\n\"What's amazing is how technology, whether biotechnology or engineering technology, is really increasing supply not only here but worldwide, creating competition,\" Kohl said. \"Oversupply and the strong dollar are really suppressing margins.\"\n\nMost of the U.S.'s most valuable agriculture products are grown in the Midwest. They include soybean, cattle, corn, hogs and dairy, Kauffman said. The St. Louis Fed defines the Midwest as encompassing Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, North and South Dakota, and Wisconsin.\n\nThat's a huge swath of farm country that needs a turn of fortunes that doesn't appear imminent.", "", "", "", "", "NEW YORK -- Harvey Weinstein was accused in a civil court filing Wednesday of forcing a 16-year-old Polish model to touch his penis, subjecting her to years of harassment and emotional abuse. The suit also claims the disgraced movie mogul blocked her from a successful acting career as payback for refusing his advances.\n\nThe accuser, identified as Jane Doe, alleges that Weinstein assaulted her at his New York City apartment in 2002, just days after they'd met at an event involving her modeling agency.\n\nDoe alleges the movie mogul promised to take her to lunch to discuss her career, but instead took her to his empty SoHo apartment and \"aggressively and threateningly\" demanded sex.\n\nWeinstein instructed Doe to take off her clothes and intimated that she'd never work as an actress unless she gave in to his demands, according to the filing, the latest revelation in a lawsuit alleging Weinstein's movie studio board enabled his behavior.\n\n\"Terrified and struggling to hold back tears, Jane Doe said she would not and resisted his demands,\" the filing states. \"Jane Doe was a virgin, and had no intention or understanding when she agreed to a business lunch that she would be put in this alarming position.\"\n\nWeinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told CBS News the new allegations are \"preposterous.\" Weinstein denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\n\"Eventually, just as others have been exposed to be liars, this uncorroborated allegation that is almost 20 years old will be shown to be patently false,\" Brafman said.\n\nA lawyer representing the movie studio, The Weinstein Company, declined to comment.\n\nDozens of women have accused Weinstein of wrongdoing.\n\nArticles published a year ago in The New York Times and The New Yorker detailing his alleged behavior helped spark the #MeToo movement.\n\nJane Doe's allegations were contained in a lawsuit involving 10 named plaintiffs, including a woman who released a video in September that shows Weinstein boldly propositioning her during a 2011 business meeting hours before she says he raped her in a hotel room.\n\n\"Jane Doe's decision to join the lawsuit is a brave one given how young she was when Harvey Weinstein attacked her,\" her lawyer, Elizabeth Fegan, said.\n\nSoon after the alleged assault, Weinstein started calling and texting Jane Doe every two weeks, the court filing said. Each time, the filing said, he made clear that he was the only person who could help her become an actress.\n\nA few years later, when Doe said she was dating a wealthy man, Weinstein got possessive and chastised her for being unavailable for him sexually, the filing said. One time, the filing said, he showed up at her building and tried to get access to her room, but security refused to let him up.\n\nIn another encounter described in the filing, Weinstein blurted out his sexual attraction to Christina Aguilera, who was being shown on a television, and then allegedly unzipped his pants and touched his penis.\n\n\"Jane Doe first froze, and then fled the office,\" the filing said.\n\nWeinstein is also facing criminal charges involving allegations that he raped an unidentified woman in his Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.\n\nThat case was recently roiled by back-to-back allegations that a New York City police detective acted improperly.\n\nProsecutors dropped a criminal charge involving a third woman after evidence surfaced that Det. Nicholas DiGaudio coached a witness to keep quiet when she raised doubts about the veracity of the allegation.\n\nDays later, prosecutors revealed that DiGaudio allegedly urged the 2013 rape accuser to delete material from her cellphones before she handed them over to prosecutors. The woman didn't delete any information and instead asked a lawyer for advice, prosecutors said.\n\nBrafman has argued that the 2013 rape allegation is contradicted by warm emails the accuser sent Weinstein after the date of the alleged attack. The lawyer says they show an intimate, consensual relationship.\n\nThe amended civil complaint containing Jane Doe's allegations was filed on the last day for lawyers to revise the lawsuit. A judge had given them until Oct. 31 after expressing skepticism about the strength of their allegations that the studio board conspired to cover-up Weinstein's misdeeds by intimidating accusers.\n\nFegan said Wednesday's 250-page filing makes clear that the studio's decision-makers knew Weinstein was a sexual predator but \"were making too much money and having too much fun to do anything about it.\"\n\n\"Now they will answer for it,\" she said.", "", "Women are poised to make a big difference in next week's midterm elections both at the polls and on the ballot.

The city is now facing a lawsuit from a non-profit on behalf of residents.\n\nRoughly one-quarter of Newark children under six have detectable lead in their blood, and any level is dangerous, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.

Activists said that, on Thursday, there were only 38 children remaining there.

Anyone who attempts the journey is currently sent to remote camps on Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manu Island for processing.\n\nPressure has mounted on the government to make an exception for children, but some government lawmakers argue that would only encourage asylum seekers to put children at risk by bringing them on treacherous voyages to Australia on rickety fishing boats.\n\nThe United States agreed in 2016 to accept up to 1,250 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. But after more than a year of screening, only 439 have found new homes in the U.S.\n\nAsylum Seekers Resource Center Director Jana Favero said 47 children, plus 88 adult family members, had been brought to Australia from Nauru in the past two weeks, leaving 38 children behind. The children had been brought to Australia for medical treatment and none of the families had been told they could stay in Australia, she said.\n\n\"The condition of the children has been pretty shocking,\" Favero said. \"We have seen children not eating or drinking for days, in a comatose state. The mental and physical conditions of these children on Nauru have been devastating.\"\n\nHuman rights lawyer George Newhouse said his organization, National Justice Project, had taken court action to bring around 50 children to Australia for medical treatment, including children who have been taken directly from the airport to intensive care units because their organs were failing.\n\n\"It's taken court hearings and a groundswell from the community to get the government to act to get these kids off Nauru,\" Newhouse said.\n\n\"I've seen some of these children myself with matchstick arms and legs because they haven't been eating - imagery that you've seen in war,\" he added.\n\nMounting pressure\n\nAustralia's top diplomat in Britain, High Commissioner George Brandis, told London radio LBC that the government expects all asylum seeking children to be moved from Nauru to Australia this year.\n\n\"There are hardly any children on Nauru ... and we expect that by the end of this year, there will be none,\" Brandis said.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison offered few details on Thursday.\n\n\"Children have been transferred off Nauru, that's been happening for some time,\" Morrison told Sydney Radio 2GB.\n\n\"I haven't been showboating about it. I haven't been drawing attention to it. It's been done in accordance with our policies, our existing policies and I obviously don't go into the operational arrangements,\" Morrison added.\n\nWhen Morrison took office in an internal government leadership ballot in August, there were 113 asylum seeker children on Nauru. Last week, the government said that number was down to 52.\n\nA YouGov Gallaxy national poll taken from Oct. 17 to 22 found that 79 percent of respondents wanted the government to take up New Zealand's offer to take 150 refugees.

That way, she said, she'd have a better future and be free.\n\nMehdi, 38, said it was great news that all the kids are being moved off Nauru, and they should have first priority. But he said he and the other adults who don't have children wonder what will happen to them.\n\n\"We all worry about our situation, what will happen to us, what they will do to us after they evacuate all the kids from Nauru,\" he said. \"We are worried, and the situation is getting worse day by day.\"\n\nThe refugees did not want their full names used due to fear of reprisals.", "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Divers have been finding bodies of passengers still strapped into their seats amid debris on the seafloor from the Lion Air jet that crashed Monday, an official of the Indonesian search and rescue team said Thursday.

He was one of the greatest baseball players of all-time and also the quintessential San Francisco Giant.\"\n\nBreed said City Hall would be lit in orange in honor of McCovey.\n\nA first baseman and left fielder, McCovey was a .270 career hitter with 521 home runs and 1,555 RBIs in 22 major league seasons, 19 of them with the Giants. He also played for the Athletics and Padres.\n\nMcCovey made his major league debut at age 21 on July 30, 1959, and played alongside the other Willie - Hall of Famer Willie Mays - into the 1972 season before Mays was traded to the New York Mets that May.\n\nMcCovey batted .354 with 13 homers and 38 RBIs on the way to winning the 1959 NL Rookie of the Year award. The six-time All-Star also won the 1969 NL MVP and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986 after his first time on the ballot.\n\n\"You knew right away he wasn't an ordinary ballplayer,\" Hall of Famer Hank Aaron said, courtesy of the Hall of Fame. \"He was so strong, and he had the gift of knowing the strike zone. There's no telling how many home runs he would have hit if those knees weren't bothering him all the time and if he played in a park other than Candlestick.\"\n\nMcCovey had been getting around in a wheelchair in recent years because he could no longer rely on his once-dependable legs, yet was still regularly seen at the ballpark in his private suite.\n\n\"I love him so much. It's a very sad day for me. We were very close,\" Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda said in a telephone interview. \"Willie McCovey was not only a great ballplayer but a great teammate. He didn't have any fear. He never complained. I remember one time in 1960 they sent him down to the minor leagues after being Rookie of the Year the year before. He didn't complain. He was very polite, he was very quiet. He was a great man, a great friend. I'm going to miss him so much.

He even waited for the team at the end of the parade route inside San Francisco's Civic Center.\n\n\"It was touch and go for a while,\" McCovey said at the time. \"They pulled me through, and I've come a long way.\"\n\nMcCovey had been thrilled the Giants accomplished something he didn't during a decorated career in the major leagues.\n\nEven four-plus decades later, it still stung for the left-handed slugging \"Big Mac\" that he never won a World Series after coming so close. He lined out to end the Giants' 1962 World Series loss to the Yankees.\n\nHe often thought about that World Series, which the Giants lost in seven games to New York, and it remained difficult to accept. The Giants lost 1-0 in Game 7 when McCovey lined out to second baseman Bobby Richardson with runners on second and third for the final out.\n\n\"I still think about it all the time. I still think, 'If I could have hit it a little more,'\" he said on Oct. 31, 2014.\n\nIn 2012, he said: \"I think about the line drive, yes. Can't get away from it.\"\n\nMcCovey narrowly beat out Mets pitcher Tom Seaver for the 1969 MVP award. McCovey led the NL in home runs (45) and RBIs (126) for the second straight year, batting .320 while also posting NL bests with a .453 slugging percentage and .656 on-base percentage. He was walked 121 times, then drew a career-high 137 free passes the next season.\n\nHe had been third in the '68 voting for NL MVP, but after 1969 would never again finish higher than ninth.\n\nMcCovey and Ted Williams before him were among the first players to really face infield shifts as opponents tried to affect his rhythm at the plate.\n\nTributes began pouring in Wednesday on social media.\n\n\"I will cherish the time I spent with you. To talk to an all time great like Willie McCovey was a dream. May you rest in Peace,\" outfielder Andrew McCutchen, who spent part of the 2018 season with the Giants, wrote on Twitter.\n\nMcCovey was born on Jan. 10, 1938, in Mobile, Alabama. He had spent the last 18 years in a senior advisory role for the Giants.\n\n\"For more than six decades, he gave his heart and soul to the Giants,\" team president and CEO Larry Baer said. \"As one of the greatest players of all time, as a quiet leader in the clubhouse, as a mentor to the Giants who followed in his footsteps, as an inspiration to our Junior Giants, and as a fan cheering on the team from his booth.\"\n\nSaid McCovey's wife, Estela, whom he married this past summer: \"Every moment he will be terribly missed. He was my best friend and husband. Living life without him will never be the same.\"\n\nMcCovey had a daughter, Allison, and three grandchildren, Raven, Philip, and Marissa. McCovey also is survived by sister Frances and brothers Clauzell and Cleon.\n\nMcCovey said that 2010, when the Giants won the franchise's first World Series championship since moving from New York in 1958, it helped eased the pain for players like him, Juan Marichal, Mays and Felipe Alou. Seeing San Francisco in the Fall Classic again brought those smiles back to McCovey's face even more.\n\n\"We're kind of getting spoiled,\" he said in 2012. \"This is two in three years. People don't realize how hard it is to get here. We've been pretty lucky.\"\n\nMcCovey presented the \"Willie Mac Award\" each season - except in 2014 while dealing with complications from the infection - an honor voted on by the players, coaches and training staff to recognize the team's player most exhibiting McCovey's inspirational example both on the field and in the clubhouse. He was there this year as reliever Will Smith was honored.\n\n\"Something I will cherish forever,\" Smith wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \"May he Rest In Peace.\"\n\nWhen San Francisco opened its new waterfront ballpark in 2000, the cove beyond the right-field fence was named \"McCovey Cove\" in appreciation of all he did for the organization. There's a statue of McCovey's likeness on the other side of the water from where those splash hits land.\n\n\"Willie McCovey was one of our game's greatest power hitters. He won the National League MVP in 1969 and, alongside fellow Hall of Famer and Alabama native Willie Mays, was a key part of many memorable Giants' teams,\" Commissioner Rob Manfred said. \"For 22 years on the field and many more after retiring, Willie was a superb ambassador for the Giants and our game.\"\n\nThe Giants said a public celebration of McCovey's life would be held at a later date.", "", "", "PHOENIX -- A woman spent six days in the Arizona desert after her car veered off a highway, surviving injuries from the crash and getting rescued after roadway workers noticed a broken fence, authorities said Wednesday. \"She was in the fetal position, and there was no movement,\" said highway operations technician Zach Moralez said.\n\nThe Department of Public Safety said two state transportation workers and a rancher were corralling a bull on the other side of a fence along a highway on Oct. 18 in the town of Wickenburg, about an hour's drive northwest of Phoenix, when they saw the fence was unusually damaged.\n\n\"I said, 'There's tracks right off the edge of the road through the fence,\" Moralez told The Associated Press. \"I said, 'Hop over that hill, I bet you there's a car down there.\"\n\nThe three saw a mangled car entangled in a mesquite tree, made their way to the bottom of the hill and checked the car. It was empty. Nobody answered their hollering, Moralez said.\n\nA DPS trooper arrived, and by then, other members of a maintenance crew showed up. They all fanned out. Moralez said his brother, the rancher, spotted a footprint.\n\nThe group followed the tracks for about 500 yards and found a 53-year-old woman severely dehydrated and with serious injuries in a dry riverbed.\n\n\"We started asking her a bunch of questions: 'How long have you been here? Do you have any pain?'\" Moralez said.\n\nDespite being somewhat lethargic and in pain, she was alert enough to open her eyes and answer questions. Moralez said she was dirty from sleeping on the ground for a couple of days and had facial trauma - likely from the accident.\n\nShe was airlifted to a hospital about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe woman recounted how she was driving on U.S. 60 on Oct. 12 when she lost control of her car, according to the trooper.
