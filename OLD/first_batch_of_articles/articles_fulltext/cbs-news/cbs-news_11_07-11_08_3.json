["", "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. \u2014 Video shot by a survivor shows the moments of terror as a gunman opened fire inside a crowded California bar. It was college night at the Borderline Bar & Grill, a popular country western bar.\n\n\"We were at the bar you know having fun, dancing, and then all of a sudden you hear... like the bang bang of gunshots,\" said one survivor.\n\nNearly 200 were trapped as celebration turned to chaos. A gunman, dressed in all black and armed with a .45 caliber glock handgun, had stormed inside. He first shot a security guard at the front entrance, then deployed smoke bombs inside and opened fire, shooting at random.\n\nInside, 11 lay dead and panicked patrons scrambled for safety. Some dived through windows while others hid in restrooms.\n\n\"Our friends got the bar stools and they starts slamming them against the windows so we could get out... Just so we were able to get out,\" one person said.\n\nAs police arrived within three minutes, 29-year veteran sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus immediately confronted the gunman inside. Helus became the 12th victim, and his heroic actions are credited with saving lives.\n\nThe gunman has been identified as 28-year-old Ian David Long, a former Marine who served in Afghanistan. Officers found him dead inside. His motive remains unclear.\n\n\"Well, I don't think it was random. I mean, he's a resident of this area, and I would have to \u2014 common sense would speculate that there was some reason he went here,\" said Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean.\n\nFBI data suggests that Thousand Oaks is the third-safest city in America. It's now the latest victim of mass violence, and for some, it brought back a painful memory.\n\n\"I was at the Las Vegas Route 91 mass shooting, it's a big thing for us, we're all a big family and unfortunately this family got hit twice,\" said Nicholas Champion.\n\nThe Ventura County sheriff said several of the patrons at the Borderline were off duty police officers, all unarmed. When the gunfire began, he said those officers helped shield some of the survivors.", "", "DETROIT - Australian telecommunications executive Robyn Denholm brings much-needed financial and auto industry expertise to her new role as Tesla's board chairwoman. But her biggest challenge is whether she can rein in a CEO with a proclivity for misbehavior.\n\nDenholm, who has been a Tesla board member for nearly five years, was named to the post late Wednesday, replacing Elon Musk as part of a securities fraud settlement with U.S. government regulators.\n\nCorporate governance experts say they would have preferred an outsider with manufacturing expertise be appointed to lead the board, now dominated by people with personal and financial ties to Musk, including his brother.\n\nThey aren't sure if Denholm was hired just to placate the Securities and Exchange Commission to comply with the settlement or whether she'll actually be able to corral the visionary but erratic Musk, who remains CEO.\n\nMusk's Twitter surprise\n\n\"With all the crazy stuff going on, she was there,\" said Rohan Williamson, a finance professor who studies corporate governance at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. \"She couldn't control him before. Is anything going to change?\"\n\nDenholm, 55, is chief financial officer and strategy head at Telstra Corp., Australia's largest telecommunications company. Her new role at Tesla came largely because of the board's failure to control Musk, especially when he made a surprise announcement over Twitter in August that funding was secured to take Tesla private at $420 per share.\n\nThat drove up Tesla's stock price and hurt short-sellers (investors who bet against the company's success). Eventually it drew a lawsuit from the SEC alleging that Musk misled investors.\n\nDenholm will step down from Telstra after a six-month notice period. Then she'll work full-time at Tesla, where she has served on the board since 2014. Under the SEC settlement, Musk can't return as chairman for three years and only with a shareholder vote.\n\nThe move vaults Denholm from relative obscurity into a high-profile position of trying to muzzle Musk and manage a company that is struggling to produce vehicles and make money.\n\nCharles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware, said Tesla should have brought in someone from outside. No matter how talented Denholm may be, and even though she appears to have fewer ties to Musk than other directors, she has a shadow over her of being on the board that did little as Musk misbehaved.\n\n\"You really have got to wonder,\" he said. \"No other CEO of any other public company would have survived this.\"\n\nMaking Denholm a full-time chair also creates governance problems because she could become a Tesla executive, blurring her role as an independent check on management, Elson said.\n\nEmail messages sent to Denholm Thursday were not immediately returned, and Tesla declined comment beyond its statement announcing Denholm as chair.\n\nFrom Silicon Valley to Toyota\n\nDenholm brings financial experience and other positives to the table for Tesla, said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management.\n\nBefore Telstra, she worked in Silicon Valley as chief financial officer at Juniper Networks and head of corporate strategic planning at Sun Microsystems. She also was national finance manager at Toyota's operations in Australia, and she's a member of the board at Swiss robotics and industrial machinery maker ABB.\n\n\"She could bring some more financial discipline to Tesla,\" which has $10 billion in debt and must keep manufacturing a large number of lower-price Model 3 sedans to service its large debt and pay the bills, Cusumano said. Tesla cars also are having reliability problems, he said.\n\nCusumano further noted that Denholm's track record as a Tesla board member is not necessarily an indication of how she'll be as a chairwoman.\n\n\"She's had a ringside seat to the chaos, and she didn't or was not in a position to change anything,\" said Cusumano, who has served on corporate boards. \"All the information you are given comes from the CEO, COO, CFO,\" he said. \"It really is a restricted position. So I don't think we can say that, well, she was ineffective as a director, the whole board was ineffective, so she's likely to be ineffective as chairwoman.\"\n\nA rarity for Tesla: Profits\n\nOn Twitter Thursday morning, Musk wrote that he has great respect for Denholm. \"Very much look forward to working together,\" he wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Denholm said she believes in Tesla and looks forward to helping Musk and the company \"achieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nTesla earned a $311.5 million net profit during the third-quarter. It was only the third time that Tesla has posted a quarterly profit in its eight-year history as a public company and the first time in two years. Telsa has never reported an annual profit.\n\nUnder the settlement with the SEC, Tesla also is required to appoint two new independent directors, and it must review Musk's posts about the company on Twitter. Musk and Tesla each had to pay a $20 million penalty under the September deal with the SEC, and he cannot return as chairman for three years.\n\nBut controlling Musk will be a big job for Denholm. Even after the settlement was announced, Musk taunted the SEC, calling it the \"Shortseller Enrichment Commission\" before snidely praising it for \"doing incredible work.\"", "A panel of three judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on Thursday over the constitutionality of Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel. The hearing regarded an appeal brought by lawyers for Andrew Miller, an aide to Roger Stone who challenged a subpoena from Mueller to testify before a federal grand jury and was held in contempt of court.\n\nThe question before the court was whether Mueller's appointment by Rod Rosenstein was lawful. Paul Kamenar, a lawyer for Miller, argued Mueller's appointment fell outside the scope of the deputy attorney general's authority and would only be valid if Mueller has been nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Kamenar said Mueller was acting essentially as a \"U.S. attorney-at-large\" who \"exercise[s] principal-officer powers.\"\n\nJudge Karen LeCraft Henderson began the hearing by instructing the attorneys to disregard Sessions' ousting on Wednesday and treat the hearing \"as if it were argued yesterday morning.\" The judges indicated they would request some sort of supplemental briefing on how Sessions' departure impacts the case. The special counsel's activities now fall under the purview of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who has given no indication he intends to recuse himself from the case.\n\nIn a line of questioning by Judge Sri Srinivasan, Kamenar argued that Mueller's office has an \"expanded\" jurisdiction and lacks \"meaningful supervision\" by the Justice Department.\n\n\"That's what this whole case is about: political accountability,\" Kamenar said.\n\nMichael Dreeben, arguing on behalf of the special counsel, defended the appointment and maintained that Mueller's office is part of \"a much tighter regulatory nexus.\" Citing testimony by Rosenstein before Congress, Dreeben told the judges \"the special counsel has a regular reporting obligation to the acting attorney general.\"\n\nHe also shed some light on the relationship between the DOJ and the special counsel's office.\n\n\"[Rosenstein] is aware of what we're doing,\" Dreeben said. He said Mueller's team is \"independent on a day-to-day basis,\" and added that if Rosenstein found anything to be \"inappropriate\" or \"unwarranted,\" he would intervene.\n\nThe argument put forth by Miller's legal team challenges Rosenstein's status as acting attorney general on matters related to the Russia investigation. The attorneys argued Sessions did not relinquish his constitutional duty to appoint \"inferior\" officers when he recused himself.\n\nRosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 as \"Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters.\" The appointment order laid out the office's mandate and the scope of the investigation in accordance with DOJ regulations on special counsels.\n\nDreeben noted that it would be a \"little odd\" if statutes authorizing the DOJ to appoint special attorneys did not cover the naming of special counsels. One section of the relevant law reads, \"Each Attorney specially retained under the authority of the Department of Justice shall be commissioned as special assistant to the Attorney General or special attorney, and shall take the oath required by law.\"\n\nSome of the biggest scandals in American history were investigated by special counsels, Dreeben reminded the court. However, James Martin, an attorney for Concord Management and Consulting who appeared in court to support Miller's effort, argued no statute exists delegating the power Mueller has wielded in prosecutions across jurisdictions.\n\n\"The special counsel is a private lawyer,\" Martin said. \"There is no grant of authority ... to appoint a person in Mueller's position.\"\n\nConcord Management and Consulting is one of the three Russian companies indicted in connection to the Russia investigation. In June, the firm moved to dismiss the case, citing Mueller's \"unlawful appointment and lack of authority.\"\n\nIn August, Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee, denied Concord's request. \"Even though no statute explicitly authorizes the Acting Attorney General to make the appointment, Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent make clear that the Acting Attorney General has the necessary statutory authority,\" she wrote.\n\nFriedrich is one of two district court judges who have already ruled that Mueller's appointment was constitutional. The other request to dismiss was brought by Paul Manafort, who pleaded guilty in September and is now cooperating with the special counsel.\n\nMiller's attorney welcomed the opportunity to bring his case to the Supreme Court, should the current appeal fail. Kamenar was brought on by the National Legal Policy Center, which sought out Miller as a vehicle to challenge the special counsel's authority. Miller himself was not present in court Thursday.\n\nIn August, Chief Judge Beryl Howell held Miller in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas to appear before the Mueller grand jury in Washington, D.C. The contempt order has been put on hold during the appeals process.\n\nStone, a former adviser to President Trump, communicated with Russian hackers operating under the Guccifer 2.0 alias and allegedly communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He is also reported to have met with a Russian national who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton, but insisted in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017 that he did not collude with Russia.\n\nKamenar said the \"constitutional doubt\" surrounding Mueller may become irrelevant if Stone is indicted and Mueller withdraws his subpoena of Miller.\n\nBrianna Borghi contributed to this report.", "Democrats made gains in state legislatures across the country on Tuesday, as well as obtaining governorships in seven formerly Republican-held states. Additionally, the majority of state attorneys general will be Democrats come January.\n\nThese victories could have national implications, as state legislatures are responsible for drawing congressional districts, and progressive attorneys general have been taking on the Trump administration.\n\nThe Democrats also took control of the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, Democrats captured 323 Republican-held legislative seats across the country. The Republican State Leadership Committee countered that Republicans won 100 Democratic-held seats. Every state except Minnesota will have same party control in the upper and lower houses of the state legislatures.\n\nBut the Democratic victory is not as profound as the Republican takeover in 2010, during the first midterm elections under former President Obama. In that election, Republicans won control of 21 additional state legislative chambers, and over 700 new Republican lawmakers were elected. Nonetheless, the results of the 2018 even the scales.\n\nThere are currently 33 Republican governors. After this election, if results hold, Republicans will have a far narrower 26-seat majority. Republicans will also have a majority in both houses of state legislatures in 30 states, while Democrats will have a majority in 18 states. Fourteen states will be entirely under Democratic control, 21 states will be entirely under Democratic control and 13 will have a governor who represents a different party from the majority in the state legislature.\n\nOne state, Nebraska, has a unicameral, nonpartisan legislature. The Georgia gubernatorial race has not yet been decided as of Thursday.\n\nDemocrats took control of the Colorado Senate, the New York Senate, the Maine Senate, the Minnesota House, the Connecticut Senate and both the Senate and the House in New Hampshire. For New York, total Democratic control of the state government could lead to the implementation of progressive policies such as making New York a sanctuary state.\n\nDemocrats also made significant headway with attorney general positions. The party picked up new attorney general seats in Colorado, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, and 27 of the country's attorneys general will be Democratic this year.\n\nAttorneys general often band together in challenging presidents; Republicans sued to overturn the Affordable Care Act, and Democrats have challenged President Trump on issues such as the original travel ban and easing environmental regulations. New York elected Letitia James to the state attorney general post, making her the first black woman to hold statewide office in New York.\n\nState legislatures will oversee the drawing of congressional districts after the 2020 Census. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 30 governors and over 800 legislators elected on Tuesday will participate in the redistricting. National Democrats have argued that gerrymandered congressional districts drawn by GOP legislatures after the 2010 Census favor Republicans in the House of Representatives.", "The U.S. attorney in New Haven, Connecticut announced that a federal grand jury has returned two indictments charging five people with the theft of federal funds. One if the individuals charged is James Sullivan, who is married to California Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez.\n\nAccording to a government release, the U.S. attorney alleges that the defendants conspired to misuse an account that held funds provided by federal grants to the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Corporation (CMEEC), a public corporation that allows municipal electric utilities in Connecticut to provide electricity. Under the membership agreement, six municipalities provided that excess revenues, known as the \"CMEEC Margin,\" would be returned to the member towns to help stabilize electricity costs for citizens. Between 2010 and 2015, according to the U.S. attorney, CMEEC received over $9 million in grants from the U.S. Energy Department. Instead, the government said, the five co-conspirators spend the funds on themselves.\n\n\"Instead of protecting these funds and returning excess revenue to member towns and ratepayers, these defendants are alleged to have used the CMEEC Margin Account as a secret slush fund to pay for lavish junkets for themselves and their family and friends, as well as for other inappropriate expenses,\" U.S. Attorney John Durham said in the press release.\n\nSullivan, 52 years of age, represented the City of Norwich, one of the member municipalities, and he was also the chairman of the CMEEC Board of Directors.\n\nThe first indictment alleges that the five men misused over $800,000 in the margin funds for \"lavish trips outside Connecticut,\" including trips to the Kentucky Derby and a luxury golf resort in West Virginia. The government noted that the trips didn't relate to CMEEC business, but instead were meant to personally benefit the co-conspirators and their families and friends.\n\nThe second indictment alleges that Sullivan engaged in a conspiracy to pay for his personal expenses from the margin funds. Included in the charges, the government says is \"airfare for a flight for Sullivan's wife to travel to Key West, Florida\" in December 2014.\n\nCitizens of some of the municipalities have been fuming over the trips for years, and at least a few of those officials who attended the 2016 Derby trip paid the city or made donations to charities under public pressure over the controversy. State law now demands that all CMEEC retreats be held in state and include official business, according to The Day.\n\nThursday afternoon, Sanchez released a statement in response to her husband's indictment.\n\n\"Earlier today I learned that my husband is facing charges in Connecticut,\" she wrote. \"After careful consideration of the time and energy being in leadership demands, I have decided that my focus now needs to be on my son, my family, and my constituents in California.\"\n\nSanchez, the current vice chair of the Democratic caucus, recently dropped out of the race for Democratic caucus chair, citing unspecified a \"family matter.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nEd O'Keefe and Rebecca Kaplan contributed to this report", "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. \u2014 Hours after a mass shooting at a California bar, ATF and FBI investigators raided the house where gunman Ian Long lived with his mother. Their home is on a suburban street about five miles from the Borderline Bar & Grill, where Long killed 12 people.\n\nIn the neighborhood, those who live nearby said he seemed to be frequently angry and unfriendly.\n\n\"He wouldn't come out of the house that much. When I did see him drive by, I'd wave and he wouldn't wave back,\" said Gareth Crites.\n\nThe 28-year-old served nearly five years in the Marines, including about seven months of combat duty from November 2010 to June 2011 as a machine-gunner in Afghanistan. He left the military in 2013.\n\nThere were rumors Long suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. Donald Macleud could hear loud arguments across his backyard fence.\n\n\"He was a lot worse when he came back from the military,\" he said.\n\n\"I suspected he had a gun there because I heard a gunshot one night, over a year ago,\" Macleud said.\n\nDuring one disturbance, neighbor Tom Hanson took action.\n\n\"I called the police on him that time, just because I didn't know if he was hurting himself,\" Hanson said.\n\nLaw enforcement had several contacts with Long, mostly minor: A traffic accident and an incident where he was a victim in a fight at another bar. But Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said on one occasion, deputies were called to the house and found Long acting irrationally.\n\n\"Our mental health specialist who met with him, talked to him and cleared him and didn't feel that he was qualified to be taken under 5150 and he was left at that scene last April,\" Dean said.\n\nThe term \"5150\" refers to a California law that would have allowed Long to be involuntarily held for 72 hours for a psychiatric evaluation. Without a mental health red flag or a dishonorable discharge from the military, there was nothing to prevent him from legally owning a gun, even under California's strict gun laws.", "Six in 10 who went to the polls this election favored stricter gun control measures, according to CBS News national exit polling, but gun policy was not a top priority for most voters. It was outranked by health care, immigration and the economy. Just one in 10 voters said it was the most important issue.\n\nAnd gun policy was more of a priority for gun control supporters than for opponents.\n\nAfter a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida earlier this year, students rallied around the issue of gun policy, holding a number of high-profile rallies and demonstrations across the country. Young people who voted in the midterms favored stricter gun laws in higher numbers than older voters, but it was not the top issue that drove them to the polls. When young voters were asked to choose from four issues the most important facing the country, gun policy ranked last \u2013 as it did for voters overall.\n\nDemocrats did have an advantage among the relatively small group of midterm voters who prioritized gun policy. Three in four voters of these voters favored stricter gun measures and voted for Democratic House candidates.\n\nIn four states where voters were asked about gun control, more favored than opposed it, according to state exit polls. Support was a bit lower in more conservative states like Georgia and Missouri, and higher in Florida and Nevada. The latter two states were the sites of mass shootings within the last year and a half. Voters in these states who picked gun policy as their chief concern were also inclined to vote for the Democratic candidate for Senate or governor.\n\nMore than a third of voters nationally did not support stricter gun control. Republicans, conservatives, and rural voters are some of the voter groups opposed to it. These groups all voted Republican for the House.\n\nOverall, gun owners voted for Republicans too, but there was a split within the group: gun owners opposed to gun control voted Republican, while those who support it (about four in 10 gun owners) voted Democrat.", "Hours before the Carolina Panthers were set to play the Pittsburgh Steelers Thursday night, the team made a thoughtful gesture to the city that was the site of a mass shooting less than two weeks ago.

It's unclear what he said in those calls, but the affidavit said they suggested a pattern of political harassment.\n\nMatthews, from Mountain Home, is being held on $15,000 bail. Jail records did not list an attorney for him.\n\nHis arrest came less than two weeks after a Florida man, Cesar Sayoc, was arrested for allegedly sending mail bombs to CNN's New York office and to several leading Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters. Sayoc, who is being held on federal charges, had been living in a van covered with stickers, including ones that said \"CNN Sucks\" and \"Dishonest Media.\"\n\nCNN did not immediately return a request for comment.", "", "", "Although the herbal supplement kratom is still legal and widely available, its opioid-like effects have caused significant withdrawal symptoms in at least two newborns in the United States and that should raise concerns, researchers say.\n\nA case study of a baby boy exposed to kratom during his mother's pregnancy -- only the second American case reported -- likely signifies a broader trend among pregnant women toward seeking alternatives to opioid painkillers such as morphine, heroin and oxycodone (OxyContin), said study author Dr. Whitney Eldridge.\n\n\"I think mothers are becoming increasingly aware of the dangers of using prescription and non-prescription opioids during pregnancy,\" said Eldridge, a neonatologist at Morton Plant Hospital and St. Joseph Women's Hospital, both in Florida.\n\n\"As opioid use among pregnant women has increased, I fear they may see kratom as a potentially safe, legal, non-opioid alternative aid for opioid withdrawal, as its opioid-like properties are not well-advertised,\" Eldridge added.\n\nIn February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration classified compounds in kratom as opioids, basing its findings on a computer analysis showing it activates receptors in the brain that also respond to opioids.\n\nBut controversy over kratom -- which is sold as a dietary supplement, typically to manage pain and boost energy -- remains, as it continues to be sold as a non-opioid remedy for opioid withdrawal. Non-opioid alternatives to treat opioid dependence continue to be researched and scrutinized, experts said.\n\nThe case study, published online Nov. 7 in the journal Pediatrics, centered on a newborn boy whose mother had a seven-year history of oxycodone use, but who had successfully completed drug rehabilitation. She had last used oxycodone two years before her baby was born, and her urine test was negative for drug use.\n\nKratom -- which grows naturally in the Southeast Asian countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Thailand -- is less potent than morphine and doesn't slow breathing. But 33 hours after his birth, the baby boy in this case study began showing symptoms consistent with opioid withdrawal, including sneezing, jitteriness, excessive suck, scratching at the skin around his face, and irritability.\n\nHis mother denied using prescription medications, supplements or illegal drugs during her pregnancy, but the baby's father reported that the mother drank kratom tea daily during pregnancy. She had bought the tea to help with sleep and her own opioid withdrawal symptoms.\n\nTreated with morphine and a common blood pressure drug over the next several days, the boy's condition improved and he was discharged from the hospital at 8 days old.\n\n\"Prior to this case, I was unfamiliar with kratom and unaware of its potential to be a source of withdrawal for [newborn babies],\" Eldridge said. \"After caring for this infant, I started to pay attention to how heavily kratom is advertised and realized pediatricians and obstetricians need to be familiarized with its potential to affect our patients.\"\n\nFurther research is needed to \"make an educated decision as to how to classify kratom,\" she suggested.\n\n\"It may have a role to play in opioid dependency, [but] currently there is too little data to say what role it should be,\" Eldridge added. \"Meanwhile, pregnant women should disclose kratom use to their physicians just as they would alcohol or tobacco, and physicians have a responsibility to educate pregnant women about the potential impact of kratom for their newborn.\"\n\nEldridge's sentiments were echoed by Dr. Martin Chavez, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.\n\n\"I think what hit home most with this case study \u2026 is that we really have to do a thorough job inquiring what type of alternate medications -- whether over-the-counter, holistic or something being provided by a family member -- a pregnant woman may be taking,\" said Chavez.\n\n\"The most important thing is, just because it's not being prescribed doesn't mean it's not having a potential impact [on the baby],\" he added. \"When in doubt, when you're pregnant or have a newborn, be totally open with your clinician not only about prescription medications, but any other type of medication you may be taking to alleviate symptoms you're having.\"", "WATCH THE FULL 11/11 EPISODE!\n\nHEADLINES: Deadly wildfires decimate California communities (Video)\n\nWildfires are still burning across Northern and Southern California, forcing tens of thousands from their homes.

Yet many stores still count on a surge in sales during the annual shopping extravaganza.\n\nThose dynamics are putting pressure on retailers to offer more holiday \"doorbusters\" -- or low prices on high-demand products like computers or home appliances -- and to stay open on Thanksgiving.\n\nWalmart plans to kick off its Black Friday event on Thanksgiving day at 4 p.m., when it will throw what it describes as its first-ever \"Light Up Black Friday\" party for customers. Store workers are expected to give away 4 million cups of Keurig coffee and 2 million Christmas cookies during the two-hour party, the company said. Its Black Friday sales will officially begin at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, although Walmart is already offering some discounts online.\n\nSome retailers say they want to give their workers a break on Thanksgiving.

A year ago, the rate was 3.9 percent.\n\nThe average rate on a 15-year, fixed-rate loan increased to 4.33 percent, from 4.23 percent last week.\n\nThe rising mortgage rates are following the Federal Reserve's ongoing monetary policy tightening. The Fed announced today that it's holding its benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said it expects to continue gradually raising rates as the economy expands.\n\nThe Fed in September raised the fed funds rate for the third time this year, citing the strong labor market and healthy spending by consumers and businesses. It was the eighth hike since policymakers started to normalize monetary policy in late 2015.\n\nHigher rates have kept many would-be home purchasers on the sidelines. Sales of existing homes have fallen for six straight months, and sales of newly built homes have declined for four months.\n\nFreddie Mac says home price increases are slowing as a result, particularly in higher-priced coastal cities.\n\nMortgage rates have risen along with the yield on the 10-year note, which has also jumped in the past year on expectations of additional short-term rate increases by the Fed, faster economic growth and potentially higher inflation.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year reached 3.23 percent Thursday, up nearly a full percentage point from 2.33 percent a year ago.\n\nTo calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country between Monday and Wednesday each week.\n\nThe average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, that most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates.\n\nThe average fee on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was unchanged from last week at 0.5 points.

Bill Nelson by fewer than 20,000 votes. The race for Scott's successor as governor is similarly complicated: Although Democrat Andrew Gillum conceded to Republican Ron DeSantis Tuesday, his campaign opened the door Thursday to participating in a recount. DeSantis leads Gillum by nearly 40,000 votes.\n\nOn Thursday night, President Trump tweeeted, without evidence, that \"law enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!\" Both counties are Democratic strongholds.\n\nIf the gap between candidates is half a percentage point or less, the state is mandated to conduct a machine recount. Here's a timeline of the recount process, according to the Florida secretary of state.\n\nMachine recount\n\nEach Florida county has a canvassing board which oversees elections in that county. The first unofficial returns from county canvassing boards are due to the secretary of state and Division of Elections by Saturday, Nov. 10. If the candidates are within half a percentage point or less on that date, the state is mandated to conduct a machine recount. As of Thursday, the margins between Scott and Nelson and between DeSantis and Gillum are each under half a percentage point.\n\nIn a machine recount, all completed ballots are re-fed through ballot-counting machines to try to confirm the original, unofficial counts.\n\nThe machines must first be re-tested and re-calibrated to read and separate ballots with apparent over-votes, that is, the ballots in which the machines read that the voter may have selected more than one candidate, and undervotes, in which the machine does not register a vote on the ballot.\n\nThe testing of the machines has to be done in public. Ballots with apparent under- or over-votes are segregated, or \"outstacked,\" and placed in sealed containers. These outstacked ballots would be the ones critical in a manual recount.\n\nManual recount\n\nThe second unofficial returns, which are the results of a machine recount, must be presented by Nov. 15. If the candidates are within one-quarter of one percentage point, the secretary of state must order a manual recount.\n\nThe manual recount is more complicated and time-consuming, as it involves counting each of the ballots by hand. County canvassing boards appoint counting teams to view ballots and determine the voter's intent, which is by law \"a clear indication on the ballot that a voter made a definite choice.\"\n\nEach party and each candidate are allowed to have observers in the room, and those representatives can object to decisions on individual ballots, but can't otherwise interfere.\n\nThe counting teams are to stack ballots into three piles:\n\nBallots with clear indication: These votes will be counted;\n\n\n\nBallots with no clear indication: These votes will not be counted;\n\n\n\nVote unable to be determined on ballot: These are set aside for the canvassing board to decide.\n\n\n\nThe media and the public may view the proceedings from outside the recount location, in an area designated by the canvassing board.\n\nOfficial returns due\n\nThe official returns are due by Nov. 18.

The federal indictment shows 51-year-old Kenneth Scott McKee faces 17 counts of misconduct, negligence or inattention to duty by a ship's officer resulting in death. The duck boat, a refurbished amphibious vessel originally used by the military during World War II, sank during a storm in July.\n\nMcKee is also accused of failing to properly assess the weather before and after the boat went into Table Rock Lake near the popular tourist town of Branson, U.S. Attorney Tim Garrison said during a news conference in Springfield. The prosecutor said he couldn't release specifics about the investigation, but added: \"This is the beginning, not the end, of our efforts in this matter.\"\n\nRipley Entertainment, the company that operated the boats and suspended the operation following the accident, didn't immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press. McKee's attorney declined comment.\n\nOne of the survivors, Tia Coleman \u2014 whose husband, three children and five other family members died in the sinking \u2014 released a statement Thursday saying she was pleased an indictment had been filed.\n\n\"While nothing can ever ease the grief in my heart, I am grateful that the U.S. Attorney's Office is fighting for justice for my family, and the other victims, and is committed to holding fully accountable all those responsible for this tragedy,\" Coleman said.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard had found probable cause that the accident resulted from McKee's \"misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties,\" according to an August court filing. The U.S. attorney's office added that the captain of a second duck boat that safely made it to shore during the storm acted in a \"grossly negligent manner,\" though the court filing didn't elaborate on those findings.\n\nThe sinking killed Coleman's relatives while they vacationed from Indiana. The other people killed included two couples from Missouri, an Illinois woman who died while saving her granddaughter's life, an Arkansas father and son, and a retired pastor who was the boat's operator on land.\n\nSeveral lawsuits have been filed on behalf of victims, their relatives and survivors of the sinking against Ripley Entertainment and other companies involved with the manufacture and operation of the boats. Robert Mongeluzzi, an attorney representing Coleman and several others who filed lawsuits, said he's confident the investigation will go beyond McKee.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ripley Entertainment has repeatedly declined to comment on the investigation but has said the company has cooperated with authorities.\n\nGarrison said McKee violated conditions specified in the boat's certificate of inspection by failing to tell passengers to put on personal floatation devices and not immediately increasing speed and driving to the nearest shore, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment also alleges McKee allowed the boat's plastic side curtains to be lowered, which blocked the exits, and didn't instruct passengers to put on flotation devices or prepare them to abandon ship even after the bilge alarm sounded twice.\n\nAfter the accident, Coleman told CBS Indianapolis affiliate WTTV that the captain said, \"don't worry about grabbing the life jackets \u2014 you won't need them,\" so none of her family members did.\n\n\"However in doing that, when it was time to grab them, it was too late and I believe that a lot of people could have been spared,\" Coleman said.\n\nVideo and audio from the boat, recovered by divers, showed that the lake was calm when the boat entered the water. But the weather suddenly turned violent and, within minutes, the boat sank. The wind speed at the time of the accident was more than 70 mph, just short of hurricane force, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Weather forecasts had warned of an impending storm with winds possibly exceeding 60 mph.\n\nIn addition to the weather, the Coast Guard has said it was looking into regulatory compliance of the boat and crew member duties and qualifications.\n\nBranson is among several places around the country where the amphibious vehicles offer excursions. Since 1999, 42 deaths have been associated with various duck boat accidents.\n\nOn May 1, 1999, 13 people died when the Miss Majestic duck boat sank on Lake Hamilton near Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 2015, five college students died and more than 70 people were hurt when a duck boat veered into a charter bus on a bridge in Seattle. Two Hungarian tourists died in 2010 when a stalled duck boat was struck by a tugboat-guided barge on the Delaware River in Philadelphia.", "", "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that he doesn't think there is \"any chance that the Mueller investigation will not be allowed to finish,\" after Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker took charge of the investigation on Wednesday. Many Democrats and some Republicans raised concerns after Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned under pressure, and oversight of the probe passed from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would be hindered in conducting his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\"The President has said on multiple occasions the Mueller investigation should be completed. He wish it would happen sooner. But I don't think there's any chance that the Mueller investigation will not be allowed to finish,\" McConnell told WVLK in an interview Thursday.\n\nPresident Trump had repeatedly unloaded on Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, which allowed Rosenstein to appoint Mueller. The president promptly ousted Sessions after the midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's pretty clear the president wanted to make a change and it occurred after the election. We'll see who he sends up. But I think any president should be given a lot of latitude on picking his own team,\" McConnell said. He added that he was sure whomever Mr. Trump nominated to replace Sessions would be \"somebody who will be able to get confirmed.\"\n\nSeveral contenders are reportedly under consideration to replace Sessions, such as Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Christie visited the White House Thursday and met with Mr. Trump's son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner, whose father he sent to prison while Christie was a U.S. attorney.\n\nNew York Rep. Jerry Nadler, who's likely to be the next House Judiciary Committee Chairman, said in a statement on Wednesday that he would investigate Sessions' dismissal.\n\n\"The American people understand that no person is above the law and have demanded accountability from their government. The firing of Jeff Sessions will be investigated and people will be held accountable. This must begin immediately, and if not, then a Democratic Congress will make this a priority in January,\" Nadler said.\n\nOn Thursday, Nadler called on current Judiciary Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia, to open an investigation into Sessions' departure. He and his Senate counterpart, California Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also asked for preservation of all records related to the special counsel and the attorney general.", "Ariana Grande is laughing at herself for making a song called \"No Tears Left to Cry.\" The song was released in April, before her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died in September and before she and Pete Davidson broke off their engagement in October.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Grande wrote on Twitter, \"remember when i was like hey i have no tears left to cry and the universe was like HAAAAAAAAA b***h u thought.\" She admitted on Thursday, though, that she has grown from her challenging experiences in the past several months.\n\ni\u2019ve learnt from the paaain https://t.co/6UT1TMi7ik \u2014 Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) November 8, 2018\n\nLast week, the coroner's office in Los Angeles announced that Miller died accidentally on September 7 from a mix of fentanyl, cocaine and ethanol (alcohol). After Miller's death, Grande said she was sorry she couldn't save the \"sweetest soul\" who for so long was her \"dearest friend.\" Grande dropped out of a scheduled appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" soon after; executive producer Lorne Michaels said it was because of \"emotional reasons.\" At the time, Grande hinted she was having a tough time, tweeting, \"can i pls have one okay day. just one. pls.\"\n\nIn mid-October, reports surfaced that Grande and Davidson split, which Davidson later confirmed. That weekend, the singer dropped out of a scheduled appearance at the F**k Cancer's inaugural Barbara Berlanti Heroes fundraising gala, hours before news broke of the split. Grande's manager, Scooter Braun, said at the event, \"Someone I'm very close to was supposed to come to sing for you today, and because of things she's going through, she couldn't be here today. And while I was frustrated, being the manager, my wife, being who she always is, just looked at me and she goes, 'She needs this time.'\"\n\nOver the weekend, Grande dropped her new single, \"Thank U, Next,\" in which she sang about her exes. The chorus of the song is \"I'm so f**king grateful for my ex.\"\n\nShe mentioned both Miller and Davidson and sang, \"And for Pete I'm so thankful / Wish I could say thank you to Malcolm / 'Cause he was angel.\"", "The Federal Reserve said Thursday it is leaving short-term interest rates unchanged.\n\n\"Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's rate-setting panel, said in its latest policy statement.\n\nThe benchmark federal funds rate remains in a range of 2 percent to 2.25 percent. The FOMC said it expects to continue gradually raising rates as the economy expands, noting that inflation remains tame.\n\nThe Fed in September raised its benchmark federal funds rate for the third time this year, citing the strong labor market and healthy spending by consumers and businesses. It was the eighth hike since policymakers started to normalize monetary policy in late 2015.\n\nFed officials also upgraded their assessment of the economy, forecasting growth of 3.1 percent for the year. Most economists expect the Fed to next increase rates in December.\n\nMichael Pearce, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics, thinks that would be followed by two more rate hikes in the first half of 2019. \"By the middle of next year, however, we expect economic growth to slow below its potential pace, which would force the Fed to the sidelines,\" he said in a note.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell for continuing to lift rates, calling the central bank his administration's \"biggest threat.\"\n\nPowell is scheduled to discuss national and global economic issues when he speaks at an event at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas on Nov. 14.", "The odds of making it to the NFL are long. Just nine high school football players out of every 10,000 will get drafted by a pro team. Shaquem Griffin didn't just beat those odds, he made history. This fall, Griffin became the first one-handed player in the modern era of the NFL. You may have heard some of his story. But what you may not know is how Shaquem Griffin ended up playing on the same NFL team as his twin brother, Shaquill. It wasn't by chance. The brothers made a secret pact as children.

Number 49 zeros in on his opponents with the speed and impact of a tomahawk missile.\n\nCBS News\n\nSpend some time looking at his college highlights and you can see how the absence of a left hand forced Griffin to develop an ideal tackling technique.\n\nHe targets the ball carrier's hip and drives his shoulder in as he whips his arms around him to make the tackle. Once his sights are set. There is no escape.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: People can't believe how good you are with one hand. How good would you be with two hands?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I probably wouldn't be that good.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I thought about it. I was like, \"If I had two hands I don't think I'd be good as I am now.\" I think me having one hand made me work even harder than many other people.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What do you mean by that?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I feel like if you only put one hour in, I probably need to put in an hour and 30, or I need to put in two hours.\n\nShaquem Griffin plays linebacker and on special teams for the Seattle Seahawks. His teammate in Seattle, and in life, is his identical twin Shaquill.\n\nThey can be hard to tell apart.\n\nShaquem is on the left of your screen and that's Shaquill on the right. He is one of the best cornerbacks in the league.\n\nShaquem Griffin: As a brother, he's very protective and he takes his being a big brother role very seriously.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: But how much of a big brother is he? You're twins.\n\nShaquem Griffin: 60 seconds. Be he makes it feel like its been years since he's been born. he does good at his job I guess because he thinks it's a job being a big brother.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Do you think it's a job being a big brother?\n\nShaquill Griffin: Yes, well, if you're his big brother. It's definitely a job.\n\nWe first met the twins at a family reunion in Atlanta, where they were sporting matching t-shirts and smiles.\n\nTangie Griffin\n\nBut back at the home they share in Seattle, they bicker like only brothers can. It took all of a five minutes before a friendly ping pong match became an argument over the score.\n\nShaquem Griffin: So what I got?\n\nShaquill Griffin: I got 8-3. I got one more serve.\n\nShaquem Griffin: 8-3? No it's my serve. It's 8-4. I knew you would try to lie. Give me the ball.\n\nShaquill Griffin: You said you got five.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yeah, I thought you had seven.\n\nThis constant competition has been going on since they were toddlers.\n\nShaquill Griffin: You know, I'll give you an extra point.\n\nShaquem Griffin: So it's on me.\n\nShaquill Griffin: I got points to spare.\n\nShaquem Griffin: That's five.\n\nShaquill Griffin: I was just te-- You see? You see what I go through? You see what I go through?\n\nSharyn Alfonsi:: What were they like as two-year olds?\n\nTerry Griffin: Whooey. One'd go that way. One'd go that way.\n\nTerry Griffin is their dad. Tangie is their mom. When the twins weren't pounding on each other they were wrecking their house in St. Petersburg, Florida.\n\nCBS News\n\nTerry Griffin: Sports was more or less s-- something to take some of that energy.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You needed to run them out.\n\nTerry Griffin: I needed to run them. I needed to run them. And they were so excited. They were like, \"Dad, can I--\" \"Run, boy. Run, (LAUGHTER) run, run, run. Matter of fact, you can run some. Give me a call when you're finished.\" (LAUGHTER)\n\nNothing slowed Shaquem down, including the birth defect that deformed his left hand. During pregnancy, small strands of tissue constricted his fingers. It's called amniotic band syndrome. The undeveloped hand caused him pain until it was amputated when he was four.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Did you ever think about getting him a prosthetic?\n\nTangie Griffin: I thought about it. And then I said, \"You know what? I'm-- I'm not gonna do it.\"\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why?\n\nTangie Griffin: Because he started working and he didn't need it. You know, he was able to button up his shirt, and button up his pants, tie his shoes.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How did you teach him, and I guess you probably taught him, how did you teach him to catch a ball without a hand?\n\nTerry Griffin: When you get hit in the face about five, six, seven, times, (LAUGH) you-- he used to, like--\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You're going to figure it out real quick.\n\nTerry Griffin: Yeah, you'll-- you'll start catching. He wanted it. You have-- you gotta want it.\n\n\"We promised each other. Nothing will stop us. Nobody will interfere in what we want. And that's to be together.\"\n\nBut the Griffins told us not everyone wanted Shaquem on the field. Some opposing coaches didn't want a kid with one hand out there and told their players to target him. And then there were the looks.\n\nTangie Griffin: You have adults, they'll just stare instead of asking. And then the kids will ask, \"Well, what happened to your hand?\" \"Oh my daddy, we went fishing and a shark jumped up and bit my (LAUGH) hand off.\" So every time, he would always make a joke out of it. And that's just growing up. But Shaquill wasn't okay with it. Shaquill didn't think it was something to be teased about. He didn't even like the fact that when Shaquem would joke about it. And Shaquill protects him right now. He's very protective of his brother.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Shaquem is now 6'1\", 230-some pounds. Does he need protecting?\n\nTangie Griffin: He doesn't need protecting, but Quill doesn't feel like he doesn't.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Still.\n\nTangie Griffin: Still.\n\nBy the time they were teenagers, Terry Griffin was designing contraptions to allow his one-handed son to do the same demanding weightlifting as his twin brother. This one was called \"the book.\"\n\nShaquem Griffin: It's literally like-- a block of wood, a book, and then a sock over it.\n\nShaquill Griffin: On top of it.\n\nShaquem Griffin: And then, like, a small block on top of the sock-- where it kinda-- kinda clips or hooks to the bar. My brother can hold-- hold it and guide it.\n\nLifting was followed by daily backyard drills dreamt up, and directed, by their father.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: What did the neighbors think was going on at the Griffin (LAUGH) house?\n\nShaquem Griffin: Like we're getting ready for war. There was so much stuff (LAUGH) going around. You got us in the backyard jumping over bricks. And--\n\nShaquill Griffin: A lotta yelling.\n\nShaquem Griffin: A lotta (LAUGHTER) yelling. And oh my goodness. The dog was screaming.\n\nShaquill Griffin: They knew we were training for something serious.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yeah!\n\nCBS News\n\nThe twins became high school football stars: Shaquill with finesse, Shaquem with the speed of a running back and a ferociousness that earned him the nickname \"beast.\"\n\nTerry Griffin: Quem would tackle you on top of the Gatorade and give you a cup.\n\nBut when college scouts came calling, they only offered a football scholarship to Shaquill. What those coaches didn't know is that Shaquill wasn't going anywhere without Shaquem. The twins had made a pact to stay together.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: When did this happen? How old were you?\n\nShaquill Griffin: We probably had to be, like, eight.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Okay, but eight-year-olds say a lot of things and don't mean it. That-- that made perfect sense when you were eight years old. But the offers start coming in. And what did-- you wanted to go to Miami. Is that right?\n\nShaquill Griffin: Yeah.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: That was the dream?\n\nShaquill Griffin: Uh-huh.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And?\n\nShaquill Griffin: I remember doing the interview. And I was talking about, you know, \"Just don't offer me. If you don't offer my brother, don't offer me. Because I'm not leaving him.\"\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Why wouldn't you leave without him?\n\nShaquill Griffin: I don't know. I think I wouldn't be the same if I went alone.\n\nTangie Griffin: And he was offered Florida State, Miami--\n\nTerry Griffin: LSU.\n\nTangie Griffin: LSU. The-- the top schools in the country. And Shaquem was like, \"Look, man. Go ahead. I'll be all right.\" And Quill said, \"No, we made a pact. We promised each other. Nothing will stop us. Nobody will interfere in what we want. And that's to be together.\"\n\nIt was the University of Central Florida that gave the Griffins what they wanted: twin scholarships. But while Shaquill became a star, Shaquem was stuck on the bench and told by coaches he'd only be a shadow of his brother.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How close were you to quitting?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I was really close.\n\nShaquill Griffin: You get to a point where he said, \"I was leavin',\" and I was gonna leave too. And then I think he ended up staying because he knew how much it would affect me. I said, \"If you leave then you's just breaking everything we promised to each other.\"\n\nIt took a coaching change to give Shaquem a fresh start. He spent his last two years in college playing like a man possessed, determined to destroy doubt or anything else in his path. His stats were phenomenal: 18 sacks, 195 tackles and this fumble recovery he scooped up for a touchdown. The one-handed player also made three interceptions.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Show me how you do it.\n\nShaquem Griffin: I mean, it's no, like, science to it. Catch it, got it in, and put pressure against it. Because obviously when you catch a ball you're going to put pressure with this hand, and then with this one I gotta make sure I compensate it. So I put pressure against it and make sure I grab it, squeeze, hold on tight to it.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And bring it on in.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Bring it on in.\n\n\"Whatever there was that might have held him back, he overcame it in some other way.\"\n\nDespite being named the defensive player of the year in his conference, Shaquem Griffin was not invited to the NFL combine, a showcase for players looking to go to the pros. Shaquill was furious. He had graduated a year earlier and was a star rookie on the Seahawks.\n\nShaquill Griffin: I feel like everything he accomplished, if he did it with two hands, he would have gotten invited to the combine first, he probably would have been a first-round pick.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: If he had two hands.\n\nShaquill Griffin: Every-- yeah, every box that you're supposed to check off that you want out an athlete, he did that.\n\nShaquill was determined to honor their pact. He went to work publically, he demanded his brother get a chance. Privately he lobbied his coaches in Seattle. The NFL recognized a good story when it saw one and invited Shaquem to the combine, where the strength, agility and speed he first developed in his backyard would face its most important test.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Once I got to that line, I thought about everything I-- that it took for me to even get there. From the doubt, to the negativity, to the coaches saying I wasn't going to be nothing. This is what gonna make your name right now.\n\nHe blew the doors off the place, the fastest 40-yard dash ever for a linebacker at the tryout. And the exact same time his brother ran a year earlier.\n\nSuddenly there was talk Shaquem Griffin would be selected by an NFL team as soon as the third round of the draft, but that came and went.\n\nShaquem Griffin: People don't wanna take a chance. And I just feel like that's what it was, it's like that in every single level I've been in, from little league to high school and college.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How often do people underestimate you?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I get underestimated every single day.\n\nCBS News\n\nBy the fifth round of the draft the family had retreated to a hotel. That's when the call finally came.\n\nTangie Griffin: So he gets up and goes to the bathroom. Soon as he went to the bathroom, phone started ringing. Shaquill looked down at the phone and he recognized the area code. And he jumped up. He grabbed the phone, jumped over some of my grandkids, and busted the door. He was like, \"I'm using the bathroom.\" He said, \"I don't care. I know this area code. Answer this phone!\"\n\nIt was Seattle coach Pete Carroll with news that Shaquem Griffin would join Shaquill on the Seahawks.\n\nPete Carroll: Shaq \u2013 you ok?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I can't breathe right now, I'm not going to lie to you.\n\nPete Carroll: He still can't breathe.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Oh my god.\n\nPete Carroll: This is a great moment--\n\nShaquem Griffin: Thank you so much.\n\nPete Carroll: --and we are really excited about it and we're expecting you to come in here and bust ass now, you know that, right?\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yes, sir. I'm going to give everything I got.\n\nPete Carroll: Congrats to your brother too and your family. I know everybody's really excited about this.\n\nJust watch this moment. Once again, nothing could come between the Griffin brothers.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You've done this a long time. If anybody had said to you, you're going to draft a guy and he's got one hand. Would you have believed it?\n\nPete Carroll: No, I would not-- I would not have been able to imagine that. We studied him-- as hard as you could study a guy, we found that whatever there was that might have held him back, he overcame it in some other way.\n\nShaquem Griffin has played in every game. Mostly on kick returns, but he is bulking up and hellbent on earning more game time. It's a page right out of the Griffin brothers playbook.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: When will you say, \"I've been successful?\"\n\nShaquem Griffin: To the point where, you know \u2013 it's not about me having one hand, it's about me being a great football player. Don't matter if I am playing on special teams, don't matter if I am playing linebacker, I want to be the best at what I am doing.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Not being known as the guy with one hand. You wanna be known as the guy who--\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yeah, three, four or five-time Pro Bowler, guy who-- the guy who's known for just having a nose for the ball. Like, that's the guy I wanna be.\n\nProduced by Guy Campanile and Lucy Hatcher. Associate producer, Cristina Gallotto.", "The odds of making it to the NFL are long.

So I put pressure against it and make sure I grab it, squeeze, hold on tight to it.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: And bring it on in.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Bring it on in.\n\n\"Whatever there was that might have held him back, he overcame it in some other way.\"\n\nDespite being named the defensive player of the year in his conference, Shaquem Griffin was not invited to the NFL combine, a showcase for players looking to go to the pros. Shaquill was furious. He had graduated a year earlier and was a star rookie on the Seahawks.\n\nShaquill Griffin: I feel like everything he accomplished, if he did it with two hands, he would have gotten invited to the combine first, he probably would have been a first-round pick.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: If he had two hands.\n\nShaquill Griffin: Every-- yeah, every box that you're supposed to check off that you want out an athlete, he did that.\n\nShaquill was determined to honor their pact. He went to work publically, he demanded his brother get a chance. Privately he lobbied his coaches in Seattle. The NFL recognized a good story when it saw one and invited Shaquem to the combine, where the strength, agility and speed he first developed in his backyard would face its most important test.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Once I got to that line, I thought about everything I-- that it took for me to even get there. From the doubt, to the negativity, to the coaches saying I wasn't going to be nothing. This is what gonna make your name right now.\n\nHe blew the doors off the place, the fastest 40-yard dash ever for a linebacker at the tryout. And the exact same time his brother ran a year earlier.\n\nSuddenly there was talk Shaquem Griffin would be selected by an NFL team as soon as the third round of the draft, but that came and went.\n\nShaquem Griffin: People don't wanna take a chance. And I just feel like that's what it was, it's like that in every single level I've been in, from little league to high school and college.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: How often do people underestimate you?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I get underestimated every single day.\n\nCBS News\n\nBy the fifth round of the draft the family had retreated to a hotel. That's when the call finally came.\n\nTangie Griffin: So he gets up and goes to the bathroom. Soon as he went to the bathroom, phone started ringing. Shaquill looked down at the phone and he recognized the area code. And he jumped up. He grabbed the phone, jumped over some of my grandkids, and busted the door. He was like, \"I'm using the bathroom.\" He said, \"I don't care. I know this area code. Answer this phone!\"\n\nIt was Seattle coach Pete Carroll with news that Shaquem Griffin would join Shaquill on the Seahawks.\n\nPete Carroll: Shaq \u2013 you ok?\n\nShaquem Griffin: I can't breathe right now, I'm not going to lie to you.\n\nPete Carroll: He still can't breathe.\n\nShaquem Griffin: Oh my god.\n\nPete Carroll: This is a great moment--\n\nShaquem Griffin: Thank you so much.\n\nPete Carroll: --and we are really excited about it and we're expecting you to come in here and bust ass now, you know that, right?\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yes, sir. I'm going to give everything I got.\n\nPete Carroll: Congrats to your brother too and your family. I know everybody's really excited about this.\n\nJust watch this moment. Once again, nothing could come between the Griffin brothers.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: You've done this a long time. If anybody had said to you, you're going to draft a guy and he's got one hand. Would you have believed it?\n\nPete Carroll: No, I would not-- I would not have been able to imagine that. We studied him-- as hard as you could study a guy, we found that whatever there was that might have held him back, he overcame it in some other way.\n\nShaquem Griffin has played in every game. Mostly on kick returns, but he is bulking up and hellbent on earning more game time. It's a page right out of the Griffin brothers playbook.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: When will you say, \"I've been successful?\"\n\nShaquem Griffin: To the point where, you know \u2013 it's not about me having one hand, it's about me being a great football player. Don't matter if I am playing on special teams, don't matter if I am playing linebacker, I want to be the best at what I am doing.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi: Not being known as the guy with one hand. You wanna be known as the guy who--\n\nShaquem Griffin: Yeah, three, four or five-time Pro Bowler, guy who-- the guy who's known for just having a nose for the ball. Like, that's the guy I wanna be.\n\nProduced by Guy Campanile and Lucy Hatcher.

They also said they will continue to conduct parallel investigations alongside special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, and urging them to preserve all relevant documents. Democrats are particularly interested in how Whitaker will oversee the Mueller probe, given his past comments questioning the scope of the investigation.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had been overseeing the investigation, but Sessions' sudden ouster Wednesday means that baton passes to Whitaker.\n\nWhen Democrats assume control of House committees next year, they will direct everything from the subject matter of investigations to the timing and substance of committee hearings. The will also have the power to issue subpoenas.\n\n\"Committees of the United States Congress are conducting investigations parallel to those of the special counsel's office, and preservation of records is critical to ensure that we are able to do our work without interference or delay,\" the Democrats wrote. The letter is signed by House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jerrold Nadler, House Intelligence Committee Ranking member Adam Schiff, House Oversight and Government Reform Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, and Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein.\n\n\"Committees will also be investigating Attorney General Sessions' departure. We therefore ask that you immediately provide us with all orders, notices, and guidance regarding preservation of information related to these matters and investigations,\" they added, in letter sent to officials including Whitaker, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and FBI Director Christopher Wray.\n\nNadler and other Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee also sent letters to Whitaker and the top Republican on the committee, retiring Rep. Bob Goodlatte, demanding \"emergency\" hearings on Sessions' ouster and replacement with Whitaker. Nadler and other Democrats on the committee suggested the shakeup appears to be an effort to alter oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe in a way that favors the president. Republicans still control the committee schedule until January, so Democrats can't schedule hearings on their own until then.\n\n\"The forced firing of Attorney General Sessions appears to be part of an ongoing pattern of behavior by the President seeking to undermine investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election,\" House Judiciary Committee Democrats said in their letter.\n\nCummings, whose role on the key oversight committee puts him in a unique position to investigate Sessions' departure, said in a statement Wednesday that \"Congress must now investigate the real reason for this termination, confirm that Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is recused from all aspects of the Special Counsel's probe, and ensure that the Department of Justice safeguards the integrity of the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has declined to answer whether ethics officials have been asked to review if Whitaker should recuse himself from the Mueller probe. It's not clear whether his connections to Sam Clovis, who if friends with Whitaker and has been questioned in the Mueller probe, and with the president would be enough to force his recusal.\n\nCounselor to the president Kellyanne Conway suggested on Thursday morning that the question of whether Whitaker will recuse himself is absurd.\n\n\"Well I don't know why he'd be recused. I'm not recused, you're not recused,\" Conway told reporters.\n\nSessions' departure \u2014 although not entirely unanticipated \u2014 came just hours after the midterm elections. As CBS News has reported, chief of staff John Kelly called Sessions shortly before a presidential press conference on Wednesday and asked him to resign.\n\nIn addition to Sessions' ouster, Democrats are also interested in looking into Mr. Trump's tax returns, and international business dealings.", "ATLANTA -- The mother of a murder victim making her first run for public office on a gun-control platform has flipped a long-red House seat that Georgia Republicans held onto just last year in what was then the nation's most expensive congressional race.\n\n\"We've sent a strong message to the entire country,\" Lucy McBath tweeted on Thursday after Rep. Karen Handel conceded.\n\n\"Absolutely nothing \u2013 no politician & no special interest \u2013 is more powerful than a mother on a mission,\" she said.\n\nMcBath became a spokeswoman for the Everytown for Gun Safety group after her son was slain in a Florida shooting. McBath made gun control a key issue. Her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was fatally shot at a Florida gas station in 2012 by a white man who was angry over the loud music the black teenager and his friends had been playing in their car.\n\nThe shooter, Michael Dunn, argued that he thought he saw the barrel of a gun inside the car and was in fear for his life when he shot up the SUV. The prosecution said that the threat Dunn, a white man, perceived from the group of black teens was \"only in his imagination.\" Dunn fired 10 shots in three short bursts, striking Davis three times. The teens were unarmed.\n\nA jury rejected Dunn's self-defense claim and convicted him of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2014.\n\nMcBath, a former flight attendant, told Elle Magazine she decided to run for office to make a difference on her son's behalf. She said she wanted to work to strengthen gun control especially after the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.\n\n\"I was very hurt when I found out about Parkland. I was angry because I felt like, here we go again,\" McBath told the magazine. \"This is not going to stop, and now we have our children that are standing up for themselves because our legislatures and adults refuse to do the right thing. And I felt that this is a time when our children need our help. We need to really be about the business of preserving their futures, our own futures, and that I would do everything in my power to help push the needle on this issue in Washington.\"\n\nShe told the magazine she was at first fearful of becoming a lawmaker, but said \"there's not much more I'm afraid of now\" following her son's death.\n\n\"In my mind, the worst thing that ever could happen to a mother, to a woman, has happened to me,\" she said.\n\nMcBath's neophyte campaign for the suburban Atlanta seat, formerly held by Newt Gingrich, got a big boost from Democrat Stacey Abrams' efforts to increase turnout in the governor's race.\n\nHandel, who won the seat in a special election against Democrat Jon Ossoff in June 2017, sent a letter to her supporters Thursday, saying that her careful review of the vote count shows she narrowly lost to McBath.\n\n\"It is clear that I came up a bit short,\" she said, offering McBath \"good thoughts and much prayer for the journey that lies ahead for her.\"\n\nMcBath's margin of victory was narrow enough for Handel to have requested a recount. The Associated Press declared McBath the winner Thursday after Handel conceded.", "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. \u2014 The personal stories of the 12 people who were shot and killed by a gunman in a California bar late Wednesday have started to emerge.

Now, however, he's focusing on more serious work, he told Tony Dokoupil in an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning\" to be broadcast November 11.\n\nStiller said that his latest project, \"Escape at Dannemora,\" a seven-part drama about a daring prison break, changed his outlook. The mini-series, based on a real-life prison break in upstate New York in 2015, is the first piece that Stiller has directed in which he does not also appear. (\"Escape at Dannemora\" will be presented on Showtime, a division of CBS, beginning November 18.)\n\n\"I had the best time working on this,\" Stiller said. \"It was a personal revelation, directing and not acting.\"\n\n\"Escape at Dannemora\" stars Benicio del Toro as a swaggering career criminal named Richard Matt, and Paul Dano as David Sweat, a young grifter who was doing a life sentence for murder. Together they plotted a way out. The key to their escape was a prison employee named Joyce Mitchell (played by Patricia Arquette), who helped to smuggle power tools into the prison for them.\n\nFor Stiller, it's a switch from his normal humorous fare, which includes the hit franchises \"Zoolander,\" \"Night at the Museum,\" \"Madagascar\" and \"Meet the Parents.\" Having directed himself over the years, Stiller said he's always wanted to find something where he could just be behind the camera.

However, despite the progress, health officials say too many Americans are still using tobacco products.\n\nAccording to the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institute of Health's National Cancer Institute (NCI), an estimated 14 percent of U.S. adults \u2014 about 34 million people\u2014 reported smoking cigarettes \"every day\" or \"some days\" when they were surveyed in 2017. That's down from 15.5 percent in 2016. The figure has declined a whopping 67 percent since 1965.\n\nHowever, the latest data showed that about 47 million, or 1 in 5, Americans still use a variety of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, which are increasingly popular among young people.\n\n\"This new all-time low in cigarette smoking among U.S. adults is a tremendous public health accomplishment \u2013 and it demonstrates the importance of continued proven strategies to reduce smoking,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield, said in a statement. \"Despite this progress, work remains to reduce the harmful health effects of tobacco use.\"\n\nResearchers observed a particularly notable decline in cigarette smoking among young adults. In 2017, about 10 percent of young adults aged 18 to 24 smoked cigarettes, compared to 13 percent in 2016.\n\nCigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States, killing an estimated 480,000 Americans each year. About 16 million Americans suffer from a smoking-related illness. Officials say it is responsible for the overwhelming burden of death and disease from tobacco use.\n\nThe new data is based off a nationally representative survey of more than 26,000 adults aged 18 and older. The report was published today in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nParticipants were asked about their use of tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, hookah/water pipes/pipes, and smokeless tobacco.\n\nThe report found that cigarettes were the most commonly used product among U.S. adults at 14 percent. This was followed by cigars, cigarillos, or filtered little cigars at 3.8 percent; e-cigarettes at 2.8 percent; smokeless tobacco at 2.1 percent; and pipes, water pipes, or hookahs at 1 percent.\n\nThe use of tobacco products was higher among people who were uninsured; people with a disability; people who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual; and people with an annual household income under $35,000.\n\nGeographically, adults living in the Midwest or the South were more likely to use tobacco.\n\nUse of tobacco was highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, followed by multiracial, white, and black adults.\n\nAbout 2 in 5 adults who reported serious psychological distress said they used a tobacco product, compared to 1 in 5 of those without such conditions.\n\n\"For more than half a century, cigarette smoking has been the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Eliminating smoking in America would, over time, eliminate about one-third of all cancer deaths,\" said NCI Director Norman E. Sharpless, M.D. \"The persistent disparities in adult smoking prevalence described in this report emphasize the need for further research to accelerate reductions in tobacco use among all Americans.\"\n\nThe report also calls for comprehensive tobacco control programs at the national, state, and local levels to further drive down the number of Americans using tobacco.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called the continued drop in adult smoking rates \"encouraging\" and said the FDA is committed to accelerating declines.\n\n\"We've taken new steps to ultimately render combustible cigarettes minimally or non-addictive and to advance a framework to encourage innovation of potentially less harmful products such as e-cigarettes for adults who still seek access to nicotine, as well as support the development of novel nicotine replacement drug therapies,\" Gottlieb said in a statement. \"At the same time we're also working to protect kids from the dangers of tobacco product use, including e-cigarettes.\"", "Actress Tamera Mowry-Housley and her husband, former Fox News correspondent Adam Housley, said that their niece, Alaina Housley, is one of the victims killed in the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken,\" the couple said in a statement. \"We just learned that our niece Alaina was one of the victims of last night's shooting at Borderline bar in Thousand Oaks.

Whether consumers will stop in and open their wallets between Black Friday and Christmas Eve remains the question.\n\nThe beleaguered retailer is facing several hurdles, which Peter Boutros, chief brand officer for Sears and Kmart, acknowledged in an interview with CBS MoneyWatch. Top among them is its bankruptcy filing last month, which may cause some consumers, vendors and even employees to be under the mistaken belief that the entire chain is closing, he said.\n\nSears on Thursday announced its Black Friday plans, which include opening at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving and closing at midnight. Stores will reopen on Friday, Nov. 23 at 5 a.m. To lure shoppers inside its doors, the company is offering Black Friday sales such as an $890 Kenmore French-door refrigerator at Sears, representing a 55 percent discount, and a $15 artificial tree at Kmart, down from its regular price of about $50.\n\nRetailing has grown more competitive than ever, with bricks-and-mortar stores battling fast-growing internet rivals such as Amazon. Years of underinvestment has left Sears in a rocky position as the holidays approach. Not only is it reassuring vendors and employees that it's still in business, but the retailer must convince shoppers to give it another chance -- just as healthier stores like Target and Walmart roll out their Black Friday specials.\n\n\"We have to leapfrog off many years when we weren't investing in the brand, to let people know that Sears and Kmart are relevant again,\" Boutros said. \"We need to reach out to customers and to get them to try us again.\"\n\nHe added, \"We do not have rose-colored glasses on.\"\n\nSince the bankruptcy, Sears has secured commitments from vendors to continue supplying its stores, which means shoppers will find well-stocked shelves over the holidays, he said. The company's decision to close 149 stores will allow Sears to \"redirect resources to the go-forward stores and the call center,\" he added.\n\n\"We're not on our heels -- we're on our toes going into the holidays,\" he said.\n\nStore challenges: Black Friday or bleak Friday?\n\nStores are getting refreshed with holiday signage. A visit to a Sears in South Burlington, Vermont last Thursday found a store without holiday signage, although some holiday merchandise, such as holiday socks and jewelry, were on display. Sears said the signage would be going up within days.\n\nThe store's stained carpets and scuffed walls signaled the location could use a bigger overhaul, although Boutros said the company isn't remodeling before the holidays because there isn't enough time.\n\nBlack Friday may prove a major test for whether it can compete with rivals with bigger pockets, such as Walmart and Amazon. Sears hasn't yet disclosed its Black Friday plans, yet it has said it plans a preview of its Black Friday \"doorbusters\" -- or products that are sold at a steep discount to lure consumers in the door -- for members on Nov. 18 from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.\n\nStill, consumers may expect more from their holiday shopping experience, noted Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData.\n\n\"The state of some of the stores makes Sears a totally uninspiring place to shop, which is not what consumers want during the holidays,\" Saunders said. \"Sears is going to have its work cut out if it intends to compete.\"\n\nSome consumers may also be unwilling to shop at Sears in light of the bankruptcy, Saunders said. First, some consumers may believe the store is already out of business because of the news of its bankruptcy. Secondly, they may worry about their ability to return items or whether Sears will still be around to honor warranties, he said.\n\n\"Some shoppers will be unwilling to buy products at Sears, especially big ticket products, for fear that they may not be able to return them or that guarantees won't be valid if the company eventually goes out of business,\" he noted.\n\nNostalgia boost?\n\nThe bankruptcy provoked an outpouring of nostalgia and support for Sears, with locations seeing \"a marked uptick in foot traffic and sales,\" Boutros noted. Sears started a campaign called \"Thanks for the love\" to acknowledge that support from shoppers.\n\n\"For us, that was our customers and members saying, 'We are going to stick with you,'\" he said.\n\nSears\n\nBut nostalgia may only go so far, Saunders cautions. \"To convert that to sales, Sears has to offer people things that they want at the right price and in an environment they want to shop in,\" he noted. \"There is no evidence that consumers buy out of sympathy for a troubled brand; if the ingredients of the retail offer are not right, sales won't be made.\"\n\nSears and Kmart's holiday plans include Kmart's Toy Book, which will be mailed or distributed in newspapers to 10 million households, and events such as its \"Unsung Heroes Event\" from Nov. 8-12, where veterans, teachers, police officers and other law enforcement and safety officials will receive an extra 10 percent discount. Kmart is also offering free photos with Santa Claus at every location on each Sunday between Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nWith a strong economy and job market, more consumers will be feeling jolly this holiday season, pushing up holiday spending by 5 percent to $1,250 each, according to consulting company PwC. Whether Sears can ride that wave into a sales bump remains a big question, but doing so will be essential to its success, Saunders said.\n\n\"Given the strong economy and the fact that Sears' own same-store sales have been in decline for years, it is not unreasonable to expect some growth,\" he said. \"The second thing Sears needs to do is demonstrate operating profitability. This may be tough at the group level, but they need to show that at least some stores can make money.\"", "Tis the season not to throw an office holiday party. That's the sentiment of 35 percent of companies surveyed -- the highest tally of corporate party poopers since 2009, when the U.S. economy was barely coming out of recession.\n\n\"The number could be due to several factors, including potential liability following the #MeToo movement,\" said Andrew Challenger, vice president at executive outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas, which surveyed 150 human resources representatives across the U.S. in October.\n\nNearly 27 percent of companies reported a policy of never hosting holiday parties, the highest since the Challenger survey began in 2004. Another 8 percent reported they are not holding a party this year.\n\nOf the companies throwing a holiday bash, nearly 58 percent reported addressing the #MeToo movement with their staff this year. Nearly 40 percent said they had not addressed the issue and had no plans of doing so before their party.\n\n\"The fact that nearly 60 percent of companies that are having parties have real concerns about inappropriate behavior shows that H.R. departments nationwide are responding to this particular issue,\" Challenger said.\n\n\"In some cases, that response may mean eliminating the holiday party,\" he added.\n\nThe subdued celebration count comes as companies sit on tax savings and generally report thriving business conditions, with 62 percent of those surveyed by the firm saying the economy had improved during the year.\n\nWhile fewer companies are holding celebrations, those that are plan to spend more on them -- with nearly a quarter reporting increases in their party budgets this year, the highest since 2007, Challenger found.", "A record high number of immigrants were ordered to be removed from the U.S. in 2018, a rise that many immigration advocates call the culmination of nearly two years of anti-immigration measures from the Trump administration. The president made immigration a central focus of the midterm election campaign.\n\nImmigration officials ordered 287,741 new deportations in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, according to the report from Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). TRAC obtained the data from the Department of Homeland Security through Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nIt's the highest number of new removal filings since the group began tracking deportation orders in 1992.\n\n\"It's a confirmation of everything we've seen coming,\" said Camille Mackler, director of immigration legal policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, in an interview with CBS News. \"They've been arresting everyone and pushing for more deportations.\"\n\nAccording to TRAC's data, the most common reason for new deportations was \"entry without inspection,\" accounting for 42.5 percent of new deportees. This group includes any undocumented individual living in the U.S. who hasn't declared themselves to immigration officials, Mackler said.\n\nJust over 5 percent of new removal filings were based on aggravated felony charges, and 1.3 percent were on the basis of possible terrorist ties, according to data compiled by TRAC.\n\nImmigrants from Mexico were the most frequently expelled nationality, accounting for just over 26 percent, or 73,339, new removal filings.\n\nMigrants from three Central American nations \u2014 including Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras \u2014 together accounted for nearly half of all new deportation filings, or 130,667 cases, according to TRAC's report. Those countries, wracked by violence and economic hardship, are the source of the migrant caravan currently making its way north through Mexico to the U.S. border.\n\nCourts in Texas ordered more new deportations than any other state, ordering 60,431 new removals in the year ending September 30. Texas courts have led the number of new deportations since 2008, according to TRAC.\n\nThe rise in new deportation filings stems from stricter enforcement policies, rather than an increase in immigration itself, said Mackler, who is also an immigration attorney. During his first week in office, President Trump issued Executive Order 13768, a measure that ballooned the list of immigrants eligible for immediate deportation, said Mackler. Signed on Jan. 25, 2017, the order authorized immigration officials to \"employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\"\n\nThe order banned sanctuary cities, a measure that was later found to be unconstitutional. It also expanded the criteria for deportation so that nearly any undocumented immigrant in the U.S. was deportable, a move that effectively dismantled a \"priority system\" that had been in place since 1996, said Luis Mancheno, an New York-based immigration attorney.\n\n\"Before the Trump administration, courts would sometimes take into consideration factors and decide to not deport certain people,\" Mancheno told CBS News. A lack of criminal history, community ties, property ownership and family members already in the U.S. could all be reasons for a judge to ultimately choose not to deport someone, despite the individual not having legal status.\n\nThe executive order, titled \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" was signed the same day as another order authorizing construction of the southern border wall.", "British Ambassador to the United States Kim Darroch said that the United Kingdom is \"disappointed\" that the U.S. has reimposed sanctions on Iran. In this week's episode of \"The Takeout,\" CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett and Darroch discussed the future of the Iran nuclear deal since President Trump withdrew from the deal in May. Mr. Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran earlier this month.\n\nDarroch said that the U.K. signed onto the Iran nuclear deal under the Obama administration because it believed it would benefit British security and intend to remain in the deal \"as long as the Iranians adhere to it and abide by it.\" The deal, signed by Iran, the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, China, Russia and the European Union, eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for the winding down of Iran's nuclear missile program.\n\n\"We are disappointed that the administration withdrew from it, and we are disappointed that the U.S. reimposed sanctions,\" Darroch said. He added that the U.K. and the EU agree with the U.S. about the threat of Iran in certain areas, such as the continued development of ballistic missiles and Iran's support of terrorist organizations in countries such as Yemen and Lebanon.\n\nDarroch said that despite the withdrawal of the U.S. and the reimposition of sanctions, he hoped that Iran would adhere to its side of the deal.\n\n\"We would regret if they decided to pull out of the deal,\" he said about Iran.\n\nDarroch also discussed the relationship between the U.S. and the U.K., and addressed the president's policy of \"America First.\" He said that while the U.K. had a good relationship with the Trump administration, British leaders also recognized the need to communicate with the president's circle of outside advisers and \"look at Twitter a bit more often than we used to.\"\n\n\"There are times when things happen unexpectedly. That's not unique to this administration,\" Darroch said. He left his answer open as to how future relations between the EU and U.S. will work out under the administration.\n\n\"Let's see where relations between relations between the European Union and this administration go,\" he said. Darroch praised Mr. Trump for pressing NATO member countries to spend more on defense.\n\n\"My interpretation of what the president says is that he believes strongly in pursuing American interests,\" Darroch said.\n\nFor more of Major's conversation with Kim Darroch, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, or Spotify.

Britain's monarch is barred from interfering in politics.\n\nWhen asked if his public campaigning would continue after he succeeds his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. Charles said: \"I'm not that stupid.\"\n\n\"I do realize that it is a separate exercise being sovereign, so of course I understand entirely how that should operate,\" he said.\n\nThe prince has caused disquiet in the past by expressing his commitment to organic farming, traditional architecture and environmental causes. In a 1984 speech, he criticized a modernist design for an extension to London's National Gallery, saying it looked like a \"vast municipal fire station,\" the BBC reports. In 2015, he lost a long court battle to prevent the disclosure of 27 letters sent to government officials on matters such as badger culling, fish protection, military readiness and the preservation of historic buildings.\n\nThe \"black spider\" memos, so called because of Charles' cramped handwritten greetings and closings, were controversial because some saw them as inappropriate lobbying by the heir to the throne.\n\nHe has also spoken passionately about environmental sustainability and climate change.\n\nBut Charles defended his past actions, including establishing the Prince's Trust in 1976 to help disadvantaged young people, saying he had always steered clear of party politics. He wondered aloud whether his interventions were really \"meddling.\"\n\n\"If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago ... if that's meddling, I'm very proud of it,\" he said.\n\nPius Utomi Ekpei/AP\n\nThe documentary captures the prince in both public and private, including images of him feeding vegetable scraps to his chickens and collecting their eggs at his Highgrove home.\n\nIt includes an interview with the prince's wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, who said Charles is driven by a need to help others.\n\n\"He's pretty impatient, he wants things done by yesterday as I think everybody who works for him will tell you. But that's how he gets things done. He's driven by this, this passion inside him to really help,\" she said. \"He would like to save the world.\"", "When former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to resign on Wednesday, Matthew Whitaker took his place. In a tweet, President Trump said that \"a permanent replacement\" for a new Attorney General to replace Seesions \"will be nominated at a later date.\"\n\nThe list of possible contenders is expected to expand in coming days. At this point, CBS News' Major Garrett reports that the following are all under consideration to be the next attorney general.\n\nChris Christie\n\nThe former Governor of New Jersey and Republican presidential hopeful was a high-profile U.S. attorney under President George W. Bush. Notably, he led the successful prosecution of Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser.\n\nAfter dropping out of the Republican primary, Christie endorsed Mr. Trump and was in the running to be his running mate. He was also considered for Cabinet positions, among them DHS secretary. He also led Mr. Trump's transition team for a time, although he was marginalized by other Trump aides and had only limited influence. Christie has since rebuilt his relationship with Mr. Trump and other senior officials.\n\nRudy Giuliani\n\nThe former New York City mayor, who ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 2008, has known Mr. Trump for decades and currently serves as his personal lawyer. Prior to becoming mayor in 1993, Giuliani was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where he led numerous prosecutions of mafia figures.\n\nAside for his work for Mr. Trump, for whom he was a high-profile surrogate during the 2012 election, Giuliani is best known for leading New York City during and after the 9/11 attacks. Giuliani was also considered for DHS secretary.\n\nPam Bondi\n\nBondi has been Florida's attorney general since 2011, and is a close ally of Mr. Trump who frequently appeared on television to support his campaign in 2016. Endorsing him ahead of the Florida primary, Bondi said she had known Mr. Trump \"for many years.\"\n\nMr. Trump gave Bondi a $25,000 campaign contribution in 2013, which eventually resulted in a bribery complaint against Bondi. However, she was eventually cleared of wrongdoing by State Attorney Stephen Russell's office.\n\nBondi is term-limited and can't run for Florida attorney general again.\n\nWilliam Barr\n\nUnlike Mr. Trump's other possible picks, Barr has already been attorney general, taking the post in 1991 under President George W. Bush. Before that, he was deputy attorney general and a domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nSince leaving the government, Barr has worked in the private sector.

Rowling claims that her former employee, Amanda Donaldson, used her money to buy makeup and gifts. Donaldson has denied the accusation.\n\nRowling says that Donaldson spent \u00a323,696.32 on a business credit card and stole Harry Potter merchandise, reports the BBC. Donaldson worked for Rowling between February 2014 and April 2017 before she was fired for gross misconduct.\n\nRowling claimed in the suit that Donaldson's credit card was for \"buying items in connection with business and personal affairs only.\" Instead, Rowling alleges, Donaldson used the credit card for a number of luxury items without permission. Rowling says Donald spent nearly $5,000 at skincare store Molton Brown, nearly $2,000 at fragrance shop Jo Malone, and more than $2,000 at Starbucks.\n\nThe author also says that Donaldson, who dealt with memorabilia requests from fans, pocketed Harry Potter toys for herself that amounted to approximately $4,000 worth of goods. Rowling said these were taken without her \"knowledge or consent.\"\n\nDonaldson also allegedly spent more than $1,500 buying two cats and stole more than $10,000 of foreign cash from a safe.\n\nDonaldson responded that Rowling has \"not suffered any loss and is not entitled to damages\" from her.\n\nRowling's spokeswoman said, \"I can confirm J.K.

The movement has spawned the \"Me Too\" hashtag as a sign of unity and a call for change.\n\nProtest organizers said Google publicly champions diversity and inclusion but doesn't do enough to put words into action.\n\nIn an unsigned statement from organizers, protesters called for an end to forced arbitration in harassment and discrimination cases, a practice that requires employees to give up their right to sue and often includes confidentiality agreements.\n\nThey also want Google to commit to ending pay inequity, issue a report on sexual harassment inside the company, and adopt a clearer process for reporting complaints.\n\nAccording to Google Walkout for Real Change, the protesters' goals included several policy changes at the tech firm, including \"a publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report\" and \"a commitment to end pay and opportunity inequity.\" Another request is to have an employee representative on Google's board.\n\nThe protest came a week after a New York Times story detailed allegations of sexual misconduct about creator of its Android software, Andy Rubin. The report said Rubin received a $90 million severance package in 2014 even though Google concluded the sexual misconduct allegations against him were credible.\n\nRubin derided the Times story article as inaccurate and denied the allegations in a tweet.", "", "FARMINGTON, Mo. \u2014 The wife of a slain Missouri Ku Klux Klan leader said in a letter from jail that she was the one who pulled the trigger, not her son.

They say she was smart and even trotted up when you called her name.\n\nTo his shock, Toro discovered the horse's skin and dismembered bones hidden among trees in the corner pasture of the sprawling campus in the central Venezuelan city of Maracay. Thieves overnight had hopped the fence, slaughtered the horse and made off with her meat - either to sell or to feed their hungry families.\n\n\"I burst into tears,\" said Toro, who delivered the grim news to other students. \"We came here, and together we all cried.\"\n\nThe slaughter isn't an isolated incident. Across Venezuela, as the once-wealthy oil nation's economy collapses and sky-high inflation leaves residents struggling to afford scarce food, crimes of hunger and desperation are soaring.\n\nRanchers across the country complain their livestock herds are meeting the same fate. There are media reports of small groups of men caught smuggling stolen horse meat - accompanied by gory pictures of dismembered horses.\n\nProfessors on campus at Central University of Venezuela in Maracay complain that thieves have walked off with air conditioners and electrical wires, forcing them to teach in dark classrooms with sweat running down their backs.\n\nBut in a new low, bandits have turned their attention to slaughtering horses and cattle vital to training the South American nation's next generation of veterinarians.\n\nThe meat from a full-grown horse could fetch roughly $1,400 at market, based on the equivalent prices of Venezuelan beef, making it a lucrative venture in a country where a worker's monthly minimum wage is under $10 at the widely-used black market rate.\n\nMonths before Miss Congeniality's demise, crooks slaughtered two horses donated to the university and that were temporarily quarantined at a nearby pasture, Toro said. Since late 2016, seven cows - including a prized bull at the center of the school's breeding program - have fallen prey to overnight bandits sneaking onto campus.\n\n\"A loss like that is pretty expensive,\" said professor Daniel Vargas, who oversees the university's cattle program.\n\nVenezuelans have traditionally been repulsed by the thought of eating horse meat, making recent developments here especially puzzling, say professors, who suspect customers are buying horse meat at their local butcher thinking it is beef.\n\nThe faculty reports each case, but police have yet to arrest any suspects. The school's budget has been frozen for over a decade, leading security guards to walk off the job and leave the campus an open target, university officials said.\n\n\"It could be an inside job, or someone from outside,\" said Isis Vivas, dean of the veterinary school. \"Anything is possible.\"\n\nAP\n\nToro, a lifelong animal lover who plans to graduate next year, believes Miss Congeniality was singled out from the small heard of five horses. She was four years old, plump and in the prime of life.\n\nAmid the tragic loss, he safeguards her skull so future generations of students can continue to learn from her, such as gauging a horse's age by examining the teeth.\n\n\"We would have liked for her to stick around here with us and leave us her offspring,\" Toro said. \"Sadly, this is not the case.\"", "", "Republican Brian Kemp resigned his position as the secretary of state in Georgia as he declared himself the winner in his tight race for for governor against Democrat Stacey Abrams.

Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean says Long is believed to have killed himself late Wednesday at the Borderline Bar and Grill in the city of Thousand Oaks.\n\nAt least 12 people were killed in the attack, including a sheriff's sergeant who was fatally shot as he tried to enter the bar, a hangout popular with students from nearby California Lutheran University. The gunman was tall and wearing all black with a hood and his face partly covered, witnesses told TV stations. He first shot a security guard standing outside, then went in and opened fire inside the nightclub, the sheriff said.\n\nAP\n\nDean said his department had several previous contacts with Long, a former machine gunner and decorated veteran of the war in Afghanistan. Those included a disturbance call to his home in April, when deputies found him acting irate and irrationally.\n\nThe sheriff said the department's mental health crisis team was called at that time and concluded that Long did not need to be taken into custody under a \"5150\" order, an evaluation that determines whether a person needs to be involuntarily held for up to 72 hours because they are a threat to themselves or others. The episode was thought to be possible post-traumatic stress disorder because of his military background.\n\nDean said the other prior encounters were a traffic accident and an incident when he was the victim of a battery at a bar in 2015.\n\nThe sheriff said the gunman used a Glock 21, a .45-caliber handgun. The weapon holds 10 rounds and one in the chamber, but the gunman's weapon had an extended magazine that is illegal in California, so it's unknown how many rounds the weapon held. The ATF is currently investigating how and when the weapon was purchased.\n\nAn FBI official said Wednesday investigators were looking into whether Long could have been subject to any kind of radicalization or whether he had any known associates, but said there's no indication anyone else was involved in the shooting and there was \"no further threat\" to the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe motive for the attack is still under investigation. Authorities were searching Long's home in Newbury Park, about five miles from the Borderline bar, and his car for clues. Investigators will examine that evidence along with any surveillance or witness video and Long's digital footprint in order to \"paint a picture\" of his state of mind, the FBI official said.\n\nNeighbor Tom Hanson said Long lived in the home with his mother. Hanson says he called the police about six months ago when he heard loud banging and shouting come from Long's home.\n\nHanson said he heard \"heavy duty banging\" followed by shouting and more banging, \"then it would get quiet and then it would start over again.\"\n\nHanson says he called sheriff's deputies and that a deputy arrived and took information but he never learned what happened after the incident. It's not clear whether that incident was the April disturbance Dean referenced.\n\nHanson has lived in his house for 40 years and said Long and his mother moved in between 12 and 15 years ago.\n\nHe says that Long kept to himself and played baseball when he was younger.\n\nInvestigators are looking into the possibility that the shooting suspect may have had issues with post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his military service, a law enforcement source tells CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton.\n\nThe Marine Corps said Long entered active duty in Los Angeles in August 2008 and served until March 2013. He ranked as a corporal in 2011 and his military occupational specialty was machine gunner, the Marine Corps said.\n\nLong was deployed to Afghanistan from November 2010 through June 2011. His last duty assignment was at Kanehoe Bay, Hawaii. He received numerous awards including a combat action ribbon, a Navy unit commendation, a Global War on Terrorism service medal and an Afghanistan campaign medal.\n\nThe Marine Corps said in a statement it \"extends its deepest condolences to the families of the victims in this senseless tragedy.\"\n\nLong's cousin, AJ Schramm, told CBS News Long's father passed away from cancer early in his life. He said there were rumors within the family that Long suffered from PTSD, though the two weren't close and Schramm said he didn't witness any unusual behavior first-hand. He said Long became distant from family members upon his return from the Marines.\n\nSchramm said Long's mother was \"venting\" at a recent family weddings about issues she was having at home with Long.\n\nThe sheriff said it appeared the shooter fired at random once inside the bar and didn't target victims, but said that is still under investigation. Dean said it's likely he was familiar with the establishment.\n\nInvestigators are also looking into whether Long may have had issues with college students, Milton reports. The Borderline, which includes a large dance hall along with several smaller areas for eating and drinking, was holding its regular \"College Country Nights\" when the attack took place.\n\nIn addition to the dead, one other person was wounded by gunfire, and as many as 15 others suffered minor injuries from jumping out windows or diving under tables, authorities said.\n\nShootings of any kind are extremely rare in Thousand Oaks, a city of about 130,000 people about 40 miles west of Los Angeles, just across the county line.", "", "Seven days a week John Chhan arrives a little after 4 a.m. to open his donut shop in Seal Beach, California.

Maxine Waters' time.\n\nWith Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives, the California representative is expected to become chairwoman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, which oversees the nation's banking system and its regulators.\n\nWaters is no friend to the nation's biggest banks and Wall Street, and she has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and his administration. The congresswoman from California has called for more regulation of banks and has opposed Mr. Trump's political appointees moving to roll back regulations on banks and other financial services companies.\n\nFor example, Waters, along with several other Democrats, were \"no\" votes on a banking industry bill that reversed several parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the law passed under President Barack Obama that more tightly regulated banks after the financial crisis. In the Senate, the bill was supported by several Democrats and President Trump signed it into law this summer.\n\nWith a Republican-controlled Senate and Mr. Trump in the White House, it's unlikely Waters' proposed regulations on banks will make it into law. However, it's also much less likely that any substantial new deregulatory bills get through, either.\n\nWhere Waters and Democrats will likely have the most power will be in her subpoena and investigatory powers that come as head of the committee.\n\nOne particular target for Waters will likely be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Since Republicans took over the watchdog agency last year, the CFPB has made many about-faces on rules and regulations that it wrote under the Presiden Obama.\n\nThe CFPB has not faced much congressional oversight since Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's budget director and acting director of the CFPB, took over. The president has nominated Kathy Kraninger, who worked under Mulvaney in the Office of Management and Budget, to be the next permanent director of the Bureau. If she is confirmed, which is likely since Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate and extended their gains in Tuesday's election, any moves she and the bureau make will likely come under increased scrutiny of Waters' committee.\n\nIndeed, Waters indicated in a statement Wednesday that a priority will be \"ensuring that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can be allowed to resume its essential role of protecting consumers from harmful practices without interference from the Trump Administration.\"\n\nBack on the hot seat\n\nBanks and their executives also are more likely to be called to testify in front of Congress. Democrats both in the House and Senate have been increasingly vocal about bringing scandal-plagued Wells Fargo in front of Congress again to discuss some of the bank's more recent missteps.\n\nThere's also likely to be more scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, which had been the primary financier of Mr. Trump's business entities since before he became president.\n\nBanking groups have said in interviews that they're eager to work on banking issues both parties can agree on. That could include student loans and other minor tweaks to laws on the books that govern how much capital banks are required to carry.\n\nBut some things will be outside the control of Waters and congressional Democrats. Most banking laws give the regulators who oversee the industry -- the Federal Reserve, CFPB, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and others -- wide authority to tailor regulations as needed. Nearly all of the positions at those regulators are now filled by Trump appointees.\n\nDemocrats could investigate and scrutinize any regulators' changes.

Until a few years ago, experts believed Europe was where our ancestors started drawing animals and other figures.\n\nBut the age of the drawing reported Wednesday in the journal Nature, along with previous discoveries in Southeast Asia, suggest that figurative drawing appeared in both continents about the same time.\n\nThe new findings fuel discussions about whether historical or evolutionary events prompted this near-simultaneous \"burst of human creativity,\" said lead author Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist and geochemist at Griffith University in Australia.\n\nThe remote limestones caves on Borneo have been known to contain prehistoric drawings since the 1990s. To reach them, Aubert and his team used machetes to hack through thick jungle in a verdant corner of the island.\n\nStrapping on miners' helmets to illuminate the darkness, they walked and crawled through miles of caves decorated with hundreds of ancient designs, looking for artwork that could be dated. They needed to find specific mineral deposits on the drawings to determine their age with technology that measures decay of the element uranium.\n\n\"Most of the paintings we actually can't sample,\" said Aubert.\n\nAubert and his fellow researchers reported in 2014 on cave art from the neighboring Indonesian island of Sulawesi. They dated hand stencils, created by blowing red dye through a tube to capture the outline of a hand pressed against rock, to almost 40,000 years ago.\n\nNow, with the Borneo cave art, the scientists are able to construct a rough timeline of how art developed in the area. In addition to the bull, which is about 5 feet wide, they dated red- and purple-colored hand stencils and cave paintings of human scenes.\n\nAfter large animal drawings and stencils, \"It seems the focus shifted to showing the human world,\" Aubert said.\n\nAround 14,000 years ago, the cave-dwellers began to regularly sketch human figures doing things like dancing and hunting, often wearing large headdresses. A similar transition in rock art subjects happened in the caves of Europe.\n\n\"That's very cool, from a human point of view,\" said Peter Veth, an archaeologist at the University of Western Australia, who was not involved in the study. \"People adopted similar strategies in different environments as they became more modern.\"\n\nThe island of Borneo was still connected to mainland Southeast Asia when the first figurative drawings were made about 40,000 years ago -- which is also about the time that the first modern humans arrived in Europe. The earliest drawings of animals in the French cave of Chauvet have been dated to about 33,500 to 37,000 years ago.\n\nWhether new waves of people migrating from Africa brought the skills of figurative cave painting with them, or whether these arts emerged later, remains unclear. Scientists have only a partial record of global rock art. The earliest cave etchings have been found in Africa and include abstract designs, like crosshatches, dating to around 73,000 years ago.\n\nThe next stage of research in Indonesia will include excavations to learn more about the people who made these paintings. A few sites have already been identified, containing human bones, prehistoric jewelry and remains of small animals.\n\nAs for the red bull, its meaning remains a mystery.\n\n\"We think it wasn't just food for them -- it meant something special,\" said Aubert.", "Tesla picked Australian executive Robyn Denholm to replace Elon Musk as chairman, a role that will give her oversight of the unorthodox billionaire.\n\nDenholm, an independent director at Tesla since 2014, currently serves as the chief financial officer of Telstra, Australia's biggest telecom company. Although the appointment as Tesla chair is immediate, she will leave her role at Telstra after a six-month notice period, Tesla said.\n\nThe appointment comes as some investors urged management changes at the automaker following several controversies surrounding Musk. For one, Musk was hit with shareholder lawsuits and an SEC investigation over his tweets about taking the company private.

An inspector general's report last month found the Food and Drug Administration's \"plans and processes were deficient for addressing medical device cybersecurity compromises.\" The FDA disputes that and says it \"has worked proactively\" on the issue.\n\nSo far, neither government officials nor security experts have identified any incidents in which a computer hacker has harmed a patient through a medical device. But two cybersecurity researchers say those devices have massive vulnerabilities that make it easy for hackers to break in, reports CBS News correspondent Anna Werner.\n\n\"There's nothing stopping us from, in a garage, taking them apart and hacking them. Nothing,\" Billy Rios said. Talk to him and Jonathan Butts about the security of medical devices and they'll say:\n\n\"We've yet to find a device that we've looked at that we haven't been able to hack,\" Butts said.\n\nThe two security researchers have examined critical machines like pacemakers, drug infusion pumps and insulin pumps \u2013 devices that help keep people alive \u2013 and found all have vulnerabilities that would allow someone else to take control of the machines. The reason? All of those devices are run by computers \u2013 and computers can be hacked.\n\nFor instance, take an insulin pump made by device manufacturer Medtronic.\n\n\"Anyone that has this device, that has one of these controllers, we can take it over,\" Rios said.\n\nThey showed us how they can send a wireless signal, telling the pump to deliver the wrong amount of insulin to a patient nearby who might be wearing it. They also found vulnerabilities in a Medtronic pacemaker that could allow a hacker to reprogram the device from anywhere \u2013 disrupting a patient's heart rhythms in a way that could hurt or kill them.\n\nThey're scenarios that, until now, have been the stuff of TV shows like \"Homeland.\"\n\n\"It sounds like a method for murder,\" Werner said. \"Am I right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, there's \u2013 I mean, there's no coming back from some of these exploits, right?\" Rios said. \"If a pacemaker for a patient gets hacked, you can't take that back\u2026 You can't issue them a new credit card. You can't tell them change their password. You can't issue them credit monitoring. They're hurt. They're killed.\"\n\nThe pacemaker vulnerability was serious enough they thought Medtronic would want to address it immediately. So in January of 2017, they sent the company a report detailing what they'd found.\n\n\"It seemed to us that a lot of it was being downplayed by the manufacturer,\" Rios said. \"I mean, they were saying, 'Hey, this isn't \u2013 this isn't possible. It's not feasible.' The way that they characterized it is wrong.\"\n\n\"They were just completely disagreeing with everything,\" Butts said.\n\nSo the two researchers decided they had to prove it by writing the code, then demonstrating the potential dangers of both the pacemaker and the insulin pump at a prestigious information security conference.\n\n\"After the two live demonstrations, people actually stood up and clapped, which was kind of \u2013 took us by surprise,\" Rios said.\n\nMedtronic's response? The company issued a statement saying it had addressed the problem and that \"existing security controls mitigate the issue.\" But the vulnerability caught the attention of the FDA.\n\n\"Any device can be hacked and that's often not understood,\" said Dr. Suzanne Schwartz, who oversees medical device cybersecurity at the FDA. She said manufacturers have been playing catch-up.\n\n\"It's a culture shift,\" Schwartz said. \"So the actions and the activities that we're seeing manufacturers take are very encouraging, they're very promising, but we still have a ways to go.\"\n\nIn the case of the Medtronic pacemaker, the researchers' work prompted the FDA to start asking questions of its own.\n\n\"That was when Medtronic finally came out and said what we had been saying all along was indeed correct. That there is remote concern, and there is potential to cause patient harm,\" Butts said.\n\nLast month, the FDA took action, sending out a warning about certain Medtronic pacemakers, and the company issued a software fix. Medtronic has also instructed users of its insulin pumps to disable certain features to minimize risks. The company declined an on-camera interview, but in a statement to CBS News, Medtronic admitted it \"took entirely too long to process, validate and mitigate\" the vulnerabilities discovered by the two researchers.\n\n\"So do you feel vindicated?\" Werner asked.\n\n\"I don't know that we're looking for vindication,\" Butts said.\n\n\"At the end of the day\u2026 for those manufacturers that don't want to move and don't want to fix their devices, I hope they realize that the repercussions are really serious. And we can't wait for something to happen before they decide to try to fix something,\" Rios said.\n\nMedtronic told us it began taking steps to mitigate the vulnerability risks even before Rios and Butts' live demonstrations. It also told us it has since \"significantly improved\" its response time to reports of vulnerabilities. That insulin pump, however, is still in use, though the company claims it's being phased out.\n\nMedical device cybersecurity: What you need to know\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration tells CBS News it hasn't received any reports of patients being harmed due to cybersecurity flaws in medical devices. However, independent security researchers have found vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by hackers on certain devices, like pacemakers and insulin pumps. Below are links to information about some recently-discovered issues.", "With experts predicting that a divided Congress will cause legislative gridlock in Washington, some are holding out hope that Democrats and Republicans can at least agree to patch up the nation's crumbling infrastructure. Don't bet on it.\n\nAlthough both parties expressed support for the idea leading up to Tuesday's elections, the sheer cost of a major effort to upgrade the nation's roads, bridges, water systems and other structures is likely to thwart such a plan. One major obstacle: Who will pay for a federal project expected to cost more than $1 trillion, especially as the U.S. deficit swells to accommodate Republican-led tax cuts.\n\n\"In this environment, Congress cannot garner the requisite votes to pass an infrastructure package unless it is largely (if not fully) offset by revenue raisers,\" analysts at Height Capital wrote in a report.\n\nOther analysts note that lawmakers failed to move ahead on an infrastructure bill even when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress. President Donald Trump's plan for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending this year fizzled this spring. It called for $200 billion in federal spending, with private industry and states paying for the rest. Mr. Trump in October also signed into law a $6.1 billion water infrastructure bill to fund projects outlined by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nRoom for consensus?\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who many expect to reclaim her previous position as Speaker next year, said in recent interviews that infrastructure is a priority for the Democrats. Echoing that sentiment, Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Wednesday that infrastructure will be among the chamber's priorities in 2019.\n\nBy and large, infrastructure has always been a bipartisan issue. We can create jobs by investing in new infrastructure projects like our water systems & broadband internet. #ForThePeople #CITIZENCNN \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) October 22, 2018\n\nWhere the sides disagree is how to fund such initiatives. Mr. Trump floated a gas tax earlier this year as one way to pay, an approach that critics say would hurt average Americans. By contrast, Democrats have broached ideas such as modestly raising taxes on high-income households and large corporations.\n\nMichelle Meyer, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, points out that a 1 percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate would generate about $100 billion in revenue over a decade. But \"until there is consensus on the source of funding, we are unlikely to see additional fiscal stimulus,\" she said in a note.\n\n\"Woefully inadequate\"\n\nThere's a reason both parties are talking about fixing infrastructure. Last year, the American Society of Civil Engineers graded infrastructure in the U.S. a D+, saying investment is \"woefully inadequate.\" They also called on elected leaders to fulfill political promises to make repairs or suffer economic decline.\n\nSome sources of capital aren't waiting for comity on Capitol Hill. Private equity firms are raising their own funds to invest in potential infrastructure projects, according to a recent Bloomberg report. In the third quarter alone, infrastructure funds raised almost $37 billion, a record, Bloomberg said in citing data provider Prequin.\n\nStates are also eager to bring their transportation and other facilities up to speed. The issue showed up in campaigns for governor across the country, a Brookings Institution report found last month. Of 64 gubernatorial candidates running for office, 41 offered detailed language on infrastructure plans, 18 released actionable plans, and 10 laid out cost estimates.\n\nHeight Capital pegs the chance of a bipartisan infrastructure package at 35 percent. Others are similarly skeptical.\n\n\"A divided Congress is unlikely to enact a major infrastructure program,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist for Goldman Sachs, said flatly in a note on Wednesday. \"While President Trump and congressional Democrats have both supported infrastructure programs, the details differ substantially and, more importantly, Democrats might not be motivated to reach an agreement with the White House prior to the 2020 presidential election.\"", "A sheriff said a sergeant who was killed when a gunman fatally shot 12 people inside a crowded Southern California bar \"died a hero.\" Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said sheriff's Sgt.

Judge Daniel Camacho also formally declared Correa a \"fugitive\" after he flouted for months an order to appear before the court every 15 days as part of the ongoing probe. For his defiance, Ecuadorean authorities had previously requested Correa's arrest and extradition from Belgium, where he has been living since leaving office last year.\n\nCorrea has long denied the charges, considering them part of a political witch hunt headed by his hand-picked successor turned arch-critic, President Lenin Moreno. Late Wednesday, before the judge's ruling, he called the charges a \"farce\" but said he was more worried about Ecuador's future than his own legal troubles.\n\n\"We expected something like this because for weeks we've been witnesses to the uncontrolled political pressure being applied to the judge,\" Caupolican Ochoa, Correa's attorney, said outside the court where a small group of Correa supporters had gathered.\n\nBalda said he took no pleasure in the legal victory because \"we can't celebrate the fact that these criminal acts were ordered by a president.\"\n\nCorrea, a firebrand who governed Ecuador with an iron fist for a decade, garnered legions of supporters by promoting generous health and social programs aimed at reducing inequality. Supporters credit him with providing Ecuador political and economic stability after a tumultuous period in the nation's history.\n\nBut the combative leader also feuded with the media, business community, indigenous groups and environmentalists by pushing through measures that consolidated executive power.

They spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to endanger Bibi's life.\n\nInformation Minister Fawad Chaudhry confirmed later on Thursday that Bibi was still in Pakistan.\n\nRadical Islamists have been demanding Bibi's death as well as the death of the three Supreme Court judges who acquitted her last week.\n\nFollowing her acquittal, the hard-line Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party forced a country-wide shut down as their supporters took to the streets for three days to protest Bibi's release.\n\nScores of protesters were arrested for damaging vehicles and property during the rallies and bank accounts of some of the leaders of the party were reportedly frozen.\n\nThe rallies only dispersed after Prime Minister Imran Khan's government promised a court would review a motion to challenge the acquittal and deny Bibi permission to leave Pakistan.\n\nReuters/Asad Karim\n\nCritics immediately accused Khan, who came to power after elections last summer riding in part on an Islamist agenda, of capitulating to the radicals.\n\nBibi's release, her high-security transfer to Islamabad and her likely departure raised the prospect that Khan's \"promises\" to the Islamists could have been an effort to buy time. The government, however, has not openly declared Bibi was free to leave the country.\n\nThe radical Tehreek-e-Labbaik, in a widely circulated video message, said it received government assurances following Bibi's relocation to Islamabad that she wouldn't leave the country until the review petition was heard.\n\nBibi's ordeal began on a blistering hot day in 2009 when the 54-year-old mother of five, a farmworker, went to fetch water. An argument took place after two fellow women farmworkers refused to drink from the same container as a Christian.\n\nNearly a week later, the two women said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad and she was charged with blasphemy -- a controversial issue in Pakistan, where mere accusations of blasphemy can cause riots. The charge itself carries the death penalty. Bibi was sentenced to death in 2010.\n\nHer case garnered worldwide attention and brought sharp criticism of Pakistan's blasphemy law.\n\nIn a letter, European Parliament President Antonio Tajani invited Bibi and her family to Europe. In the letter, a copy of which was seen by The Associated Press, Tajani tells Bibi's husband Ashiq Masih, that the European Parliament is \"extremely concerned for your safety as well as your family's, due to the violence by extremist elements in Pakistan.\"\n\nThe letter added to expectations that Bibi and her family would leave for Europe, though their destination has not been confirmed. Earlier, Spain and France had offered her asylum.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSpeaking to the AP earlier this week in the Punjab capital of Lahore, Masih said he hasn't slept much since Bibi's acquittal and the subsequent Islamist rage.\n\nFear consumes him every time his phone rings and the shouts of the radicals, \"Hang her!\" haunt him constantly, he said.\n\n\"Sometimes I pace on the rooftop, sometimes I walk on the road outside our home,\" he said. \"I look at the faces around me and I wonder if anyone is waiting to hurt us.\"\n\nHis initial joy at the acquittal quickly turned to heart-wrenching sadness when he realized his wife and his family's ordeal was still not over.\n\nEven mere suggestions of blasphemy can whip mobs into a lynching frenzy in Pakistan. In 2011, the governor of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, the minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian, was shot and killed.\n\nFor Bibi's husband, leaving Pakistan is a painful decision but still a matter of life and death.\n\n\"We have no other choice but to leave,\" he said. \"I love Pakistan but I can't live here.\"\n\nEven in Bibi's home village of Aitta Wali -- a poor farming community where animals and villagers share tiny sunbaked mud houses -- villagers are still outraged by her acquittal and warned a visiting AP reporter to \"go. Just get out. Go.\"\n\n\"Our entire village swore on the Quran that she insulted the prophet but no one believes us and everyone believes her,\" said Aman Ali, one of the villagers. \"Before this we liked the Christian families. We always got along. But now there is only anger.\"\n\nThe village's remaining three Christian families have fled.\n\nMuhammad Afzal Qadri, a leader in the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party and religious scholar, said he doesn't regret calling for the deaths of the judges who acquitted Bibi -- or for calling on his followers to overthrow Khan's government.\n\nAt his sprawling madrassa in the Punjab city of Gujrat, Qadri told the AP this week that he had the religious authority to declare a fatwa, or edict, demanding the judges be killed.\n\nPakistan is bound by Islamic injunctions, he said, adding that he was qualified to decide such matters. The West only seeks to undermine Pakistan's Islamic traditions and culture, Qadri said.\n\nZahid Hussain, author of two books on militancy in Pakistan, said Islamist rallies over Bibi's acquittal were an attempt to regain positions the extremists had lost in the July elections.\n\n\"They are trying to mobilize people on this issue, creating more extremism,\" said Hussain. \"They have created a sense of fear in society, for anyone who disagrees with their view of Islam.\"", "THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Thirteen people including a sheriff's deputy and the gunman were killed in a shooting in a crowded bar here late Wednesday night, reports CBS Los Angeles.

In September, Superior Court Judge Michael Corey oversaw the sentencing of no jail time for Justin Schneider, who police said offered a ride to a woman, choked her until she blacked out and masturbated on her.\n\nSchneider, 34, in September pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison. With credit for time served in home confinement, he walked out of the plea hearing a free man.\n\nCorey acknowledged the sentence was light but deferred to prosecutors on what could be proven. Prosecutors said they could not prove kidnapping and the plea deal followed the law.\n\nAfter the decision became national news, sexual assault survivor Elizabeth Williams launched a grassroots campaign to oust Corey, CBS Anchorage affiliate KTVA reports.\n\nWilliams and other critics of Corey believe the judge should have used his power to reject the plea deal, or at least call for a continuance to gather more information. They also accused Corey of spending more than seven minutes explaining his decision to accept the plea deal, and then failing to specifically address or acknowledge the victim.\n\nWilliams told KTVA the voters rejecting Corey is a \"somber victory.\"\n\n\"We don't take joy in a man losing his job and I have no ill will for Michael Corey, I believe he's a good man and husband and father. We don't wish him ill, but we do believe that he did fail at his job in this case and so I do see it as a victory for Alaskans everywhere, especially victims of crime who have been let down for far too long by our judicial system,\" said Williams.\n\nCorey's supporters argued that there wasn't much Corey could due under what Alaska Gov. Bill Walker called a \"loophole\" in the state law that didn't allow prosecutors to charge him with a sex crime. Corey's supporters believe the campaign to oust him is an injustice in response to an injustice. They pushed for changes in the law rather than having him removed.\n\nThe Alaska Judicial Council recommended every judge on the ballot for retention, including Corey, KTVA reports. Since the Council began evaluating judges for retention in 1976, voters have never before chosen to remove a judge from the bench who was recommended for retention by the Council, according to KTVA.\n\nCorey has been on the bench since 2014 and this was the first time he was up for retention.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "The White House has suspended CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass Wednesday, hours after he sparred with President Trump at a press briefing.

At the time, the president said he didn't want to discuss Sessions' future.\n\n\"I'd rather answer that at a little bit different time. We're looking at a lot of different things, including Cabinet,\" the president said.

She signed onto a lawsuit by a number of states challenging Obama's Deferred Action Against Childhood Arrivals program, which Mr. Trump tried to end. She also joined a lawsuit attempting to overturn the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nBondi is no stranger to controversy involving Mr. Trump. Last year, a Florida state prosecutor said a bribery complaint against Mr. Trump and Bondi lacked enough evidence to move forward.

After shepherding the Affordable Care Act through Congress, she was relegated to the post of minority leader after the Republican wave in 2010. Pelosi stands ready to return to the job, but an increasing number of Democrats have called for a fresh face to run the party.\n\nThere will be at least 29 new members coming to Congress in January, giving the Democrats at minimum a net 27-seat gain as of Wednesday morning. Eight of those newcomers have publicly stated that they will not vote for Pelosi for speaker: Reps.-elect Max Rose, Jason Crow, Haley Stevens, Anthony Brindisi, Abigail Spanberger, Jeff Van Drew, Joe Cunningham, and Conor Lamb, who was originally elected in a special House race in March.\n\nA number of the other members-elect have said they won't reveal their vote until they know who the candidates are, or that they support the idea of new leadership but won't commit to voting against Pelosi.\n\nRepublicans have sought to capitalize on Pelosi's low favorability numbers for several campaign cycles. Their go-to negative campaign ad is one that accuses a Democratic candidate of being a \"Nancy Pelosi liberal.\" National exit polls show that just over half of Americans who voted Tuesday hold an unfavorable view of Pelosi, a number that jumps to nine in 10 among Republicans. Just 31 percent view her favorably, including about six in 10 Democrats.\n\nMany Democrats who pledged to oppose Pelosi were running in deep red districts and were defeated on election night.\n\nThe week after Thanksgiving, Democrats will take a closed-door, secret ballot vote on the next speaker. They won't have to take a public vote until the House formally convenes for the next session on January 3, 2019. Sometimes, members are known to vote against a candidate for speaker during the secret, closed-door ballot vote but then vote for them on the floor of the House so that they don't prevent the speaker candidate from getting the 218 votes they need. In 2016, 63 Democrats voted against Pelosi for minority leader on a secret ballot.\n\nBy Wednesday morning Democrats had netted 27 seats, giving them a 222-seat majority in the House -- just four more than Pelosi will need on the floor to become speaker. There are 13 competitive races that are still too close to call, some of which will likely go to Democrats.\n\nBut it's far from a foregone conclusion that Pelosi can't overcome the vote deficit.\n\nShe has donated millions of dollars to help the Democrats win back the House, including $6.7 million to those in competitive districts Democrats were aiming to flip from Republican control, and she has several weeks to dangle promising committee assignments or other incentives to secure votes. Pelosi is, if nothing else, a master vote-counter and persuader and one should not discount her ability to round up the votes.\n\nHer allies will argue that she is the battle-proven leader the Democrats need to take on President Trump, given her past experience as a Democratic speaker negotiating with a Republican president, according to a senior Democratic aide. Additionally, Democrats elected a record number of women in 2018 and rode into power on the backs of female voters, which bolsters the argument for having a woman leading the Democratic Party.\n\nBeyond the new members who have pledged to oppose Pelosi, CBS News' Ed O'Keefe and Bo Erickson reported in September that 11 House Democrats attempted to force a rules change that would require any speaker candidate to win at least 218 Democratic votes before they are allowed to run for the position on the floor. The attempt failed, but those 11 members represent a contingent of lawmakers who want to see new leadership.\n\nWith roughly 20 lawmakers indicating that they don't want to support Pelosi for speaker, one critical question remains: if not her, who?\n\nThere are several names that have been floated as potential speaker candidates -- Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, Cheri Bustos, and Adam Schiff to name a few -- but none are expected challenge her directly. Same with the number two Democrat, Steny Hoyer. If Pelosi moves forward with her bid for speaker, those 20 members will have to ask themselves whether they want to make her vulnerable to a challenge on the House floor, leaving Democrats squabbling just when they've gotten the majority back after nearly a decade in the wilderness.\n\nCBS News' Sarah Horbacewicz, Ed O'Keefe and Jennifer De Pinto contributed to this story", "Mitt Romney is finally heading to Washington.

But not once did I see him use his platform of 20 million followers for ANYTHING uplifting I'm sure he didn't vote didn't encourage anyone to vote.\"\n\nJa Rule claimed that 50 Cent was guilty of \"only Tom f**king foolery tearing down other ppl of color.\" He said that 50 Cent instead spends time talking trash about others, and asked fans, \"let's STOP supporting ppl who don't support their own.\" He seemed to hint that 50 Cent was a traitor for taking a photo with Mr. Trump and called him a \"boot-licking\" racial epithet.\n\nJa Rule and 50 Cent, who both hail from Queens, have been at odds since the 1990s, but their feud was reignited recently after 50 Cent announced in October on Instagram that he was buying 200 front-row tickets to a Ja Rule concert on Groupon, just to keep them empty.\n\n50 Cent wrote on Instagram that he spent \"3 bands,\" or $3,000, on 200 tickets, priced at $15 each on the discount site Groupon. Billboard reported that the tickets were to Ja Rule's Nov. 9 concert in Arlington, Texas, so it's yet to be seen how empty the venue will look.", "A unique pair of high-tech robotic pants could someday offer mobility to the elderly and people in wheelchairs around the world.

Just under half of surveyed voters mentioned it, while 70 percent said the health care system needs major changes. Voters' fears about health care may even have propelled the Democrats to win control of the House of Representatives: More than half of voters surveyed said the Democratic Party would be better able to protect people with preexisting health conditions.\n\nBut now the hard work begins. Partisan lines are still solid, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and likely new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi digging in on opposite sides of almost everything. In the end, health care improvements for consumers will likely be slow in coming and incremental, happening one issue at a time, if any happen at all.\n\nHere's a look at three of the most important issues that motivated voters and what lies ahead for each:\n\nProtect patients with preexisting conditions\n\nDespite just about every candidate from either party and President Donald Trump saying they would support coverage for people with preexisting conditions, the new Congress may have to deal fairly soon with a serious threat to this important protection.\n\nIn September, a federal judge heard arguments from 18 state attorneys general and two governors in a lawsuit designed to eliminate the Affordable Care Act once and for all. The state AGs argue that because the new tax law eliminated the individual mandate fine, the mandate is deemed unconstitutional and the entire law is no longer valid.\n\nIn June, the Trump administration decided not to defend the ACA against this lawsuit, and it agreed in part that protections for people with preexisting conditions should be overturned.\n\nNow that the midterms are in the past, the judge's ruling is expected soon. If he decides in favor of the argument, all protections under the ACA, including protections for preexisting conditions, would no longer exist.\n\nCongress may be able to pass bipartisan legislation that would negate any positive ruling in the suit, which could proceed to a Supreme Court that has two new sitting justices. Legislation could create preexisting condition protections separate from the ACA. But Democrats and Republicans have differed in the past on how to get that done.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump's executive orders expanding the use of short-term and association health care policies that would not have to provide ACA protections -- including coverage for preexisting conditions -- continue to undermine the health care law.\n\nLower prescription drug prices\n\nSome analysts say this is an issue that Democrats and Republicans can come together on to pass effective legislation. Lots of ideas are on the table, such as introducing laws that would regulate the rebates drug companies give to third-party pharmacy benefit managers, which are widely blamed for inflating drug prices.\n\nThe one big sticking point? Direct government negotiation with pharmaceutical companies through programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nLast month, President Trump announced a plan under which the federal government would use a global pricing index to price the drugs administered by physicians and paid for through Medicare Part B. The U.S. pays far more than other industrialized nations for these drugs.\n\nIt's a bold move. But by using a price index, the Trump administration skirts the issue of negotiating directly with drug companies, who maintain a large lobbying effort and make generous campaign contributions. He's taking the price index route, even though on the 2016 campaign trail, Mr. Trump promised that his administration would implement negotiation with drug companies.\n\nAs a result, drug prices became a focal point of the midterms. And so did Big Pharma's money. This year, 72 percent of candidates on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee list rejected corporate PAC money, including funds from drug companies, according to Roll Call.\n\nThis may signal that those elected won't be reluctant to take on the giant industry. And in her post-election remarks, Pelosi pledged that Democrats would take \"very, very strong legislative action\" to lower the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nExpand Medicaid\n\nMedicaid expansion was a calling card of Obamacare. After court battles, states were allowed to decide whether they would loosen income restrictions to offer extended Medicaid coverage to low-income individuals as described under the law. A total of 18 states decided against Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn the midterms, however, three of those states -- Idaho, Nebraska and Utah -- passed ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid. In three more states -- Kansas, Maine and Wisconsin -- voters elected governors who supported Medicaid expansion, increasing the likelihood that these states will also offer the extra benefits.\n\nWhile these are state initiatives, the results send a message to Congress that many voters still favor ACA Medicaid expansion.\n\nAlong those lines, 28 states also have taken actions to strengthen their ACA individual insurance marketplaces, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund. These actions include implementing reinsurance programs and rules that limit or ban the health care plans the Trump administration recently introduced that don't comply with the ACA.", "", "President Trump announced Wednesday that Jeff Sessions had resigned as attorney general and will be replaced by Matthew Whitaker, who had been Sessions' chief of staff at the Justice Department. Whitaker will also replace Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\"We are pleased to announce that Matthew G. Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"He will serve our Country well.\"\n\nMr. Trump added that a \"permanent replacement\" for Sessions \"will be nominated at a later date.\" Sessions resigned at Mr. Trump's request.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2009, Whitaker, 49, served as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa.

He was also an accomplished member of the Hawkeyes football team, and played in the 1991 Rose Bowl.\n\nWhitaker was hired by Sessions to be his chief of staff in September 2017.

The president dodged that question, but he did single out Whitaker for praise.\n\n\"Well, I'd never talk about that, but I can tell you Matt Whitaker is a great guy,\" he said.", "", "", "", "", "", "NEW YORK \u2014 A jury has been selected for the U.S. trial of the Mexican drug lord known as \"El Chapo.\" Seven women and five men were selected Wednesday as jurors in the case against Joaquin Guzman. The trial is set to begin Nov. 13 with opening statements in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nGuzman, who twice escaped Mexican jails, has pleaded not guilty to 17 charges including drug smuggling, money laundering and conspiring to murder. Guzman is believed to have led the Sinaloa cartel for decades, as it became the largest drug trafficking organization in the world. U.S. prosecutors say he oversaw hundreds of murders, kidnappings and other violent acts.\n\nCourtesy of Jane Rosenberg\n\nHis notoriety has prompted security measures that include keeping the jurors anonymous beyond the length of the trial. Federal agents and K-9 officers were stationed outside the courthouse and in the hallway leading to the courtroom where jury selection began Monday, according to CBS News producer Cassandra Gauthier. Jurors are expected to be escorted to and from the courthouse each day by U.S. Marshals, CBS News' Nikki Battiste reports.\n\nGuzman also has been held in solitary confinement and barred from having visits from his wife. This week, a defense lawyer asked the judge to allow Guzman's wife to embrace him in court before opening statements. The judge hasn't ruled on that.\n\nOne of the jurors, a Hispanic woman, on Wednesday told U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in tears that she did not want to serve, Gauthier reports.\n\nSeven women and five men comprise the 12-person jury, with six jurors slated as alternates. Three of the jurors are immigrants of European, African and South Asian descent. Several others are fluent in Spanish, and a number either had former careers in law enforcement or have family in law enforcement, according to Gauthier.\n\nOne of the immigrant jurors replied \"I have no clue\" when asked whether she knew of Guzman, Gauthier reports. Others had general knowledge of the case and some had seen the Netflix drama series chronicling Guzman's story.\n\nReuters/Henry Romero\n\nGuzman attorney Eduardo Balarezo said he is \"satisfied\" with the juror selections.\n\n\"We trust they will do their duty,\" Balarezo said.\n\nCogan addressed the newly empaneled jurors and warned them to avoid media coverage and not to discuss the case.\n\nThe jurors are expected to be officially sworn in before opening statements on Tuesday.", "One day after the midterm elections that cost House Republicans their majority, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he would seek to remain atop the party caucus as minority leader once Congress returns in January.\n\n\"We have a responsibility to protect our constituents from higher taxes and increasing government control over their lives, and we need to lay the groundwork to regain the majority so that we can continue working alongside President Trump to fulfill our promise to fundamentally change Washington,\" he wrote in a letter to colleagues. \"I helped build a majority from a deeper hole than this and I have what it takes to do it again.\"\n\nMcCarthy pledged to \"be a listener every bit as much as a leader\" and \"use every tool at our disposal to deliberately challenge House Democrats and move the Senate to the right.\"\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus co-chair Jim Jordan announced this morning that he would run for the position as well. The band of conservative House members lost two members in last night's elections, Virginia Reps. Scott Taylor and Dave Brat, making Jordan's chances of beating McCarthy slimmer than they were when he was planning to challenge McCarthy for speaker.\n\nMcCarthy ran for speaker in 2015 after then-Speaker John Boehner resigned. He wound up ending his bid amid opposition from conservatives. Paul Ryan, who won the job, announced earlier this year he would retire from Congress at the end of this term.\n\nSeparately, GOP Whip Steve Scalise announced his bid to remain the Republican whip in the next Congress.

Not just the CIA, NSA, the DIA \u2013 all the intelligence agencies that are out there \u2013 collecting intelligence,\" Maltz said.\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel recently indicated that her agency would increase its counternarcotics efforts to combat opioids entering the United States. \"No foreign challenge has had a more direct and devastating impact on American families and communities,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the DEA's 2018 National Threat Assessment released last week, illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids \u2013 primarily sourced from China and Mexico \u2013 are now the most lethal category of opioids used in the United States.\n\n\"It is currently not possible to determine which source, Mexico or China, is the greater direct threat as a supplier,\" the report said, in part because fentanyl sourced from China arrives in quantities that are significantly smaller, but of an exceptionally high purity.\n\nThe report said there were indications that Mexican traffickers order fentanyl from China before adulterating it and smuggling it over U.S. borders, \"meaning an unknown amount of seized Mexican parcels containing fentanyl are ultimately of Chinese origin.\" 2016 marked the first year that deaths from synthetic opioids was higher than deaths from other illicit drugs, the report said.\n\nIn all, drug poisoning deaths are at their highest-ever recorded level and, since 2011, have outnumbered deaths by firearms, motor vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide, according to the DEA.\n\n\"It's unprecedented. We've never had this in the history of our country happen,\" Maltz said. \"China is not only sending fentanyl that's made in labs in China at very pure levels to Mexico, they're also sending these powerful precursors that are producing no longer a pound of meth, but hundreds and thousands of pounds of meth.\"\n\n\"When I was a young agent, if you seized one pound of meth, that was a lot,\" Maltz told Winnefeld. \"Now they're seizing 600, 700, 800, 900 pounds of meth. So there's problems with cocaine, there's problems with meth, there's problems with K2/spice,\" he said, referring to other kinds of synthetic drugs sometimes known as \"synthetic marajuana.\"\n\nMaltz blamed what he called \"an explosion of addiction\" in the United States on a dangerous combination: the development of powerful opioids that were subsequently overprescribed; the increased production of synthetic drugs, including fentanyl; and new kinds of customers targeted by dealers and traffickers in vulnerable communities across the country.\n\n\"This is a situation, as you know firsthand, that can happen to any family in America,\" Maltz said. \"So every parent, every educator, every school, every college must start educating themselves to help these kids in our future.\"\n\nWinnefeld lost his 19-year-old son, Jonathan, to a fentanyl-infused heroin overdose last September.

Jahana Hayes of Connecticut and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts also became the first women of color elected to represent their respective states.\n\nAccording to the Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics, the next Congress will feature a record of women of color, and a record number of non-incumbent women.\n\nIn the Senate, Kyrsten Sinema was elected as Arizona's first female senator. She is also the first openly bisexual person to serve in the Senate.\n\nMost of the women in Congress will be Democrats. But Republican women registered their own firsts as well. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee will be first woman representing that state. And if she wins a run-off, Cindy Hyde-Smith will remain the first woman to represent Mississippi.

They now control a major road leading into the city, military officials and witnesses on both sides of the front line said.\n\nHodeida has become the epicenter of Yemen's conflict. Its port is a lifeline for millions of Yemenis who are at risk of famine, BBC News reports. As much as 80 percent the humanitarian supplies, fuel and commercial goods that they depend on are delivered through the facility. Officials with the United Nations have warned that if it is damaged, destroyed or blocked, the toll in lives could be catastrophic.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition, which seeks to restore to power the internationally recognized Yemeni government, has been at war with the Houthis since March 2015. The U.S. has sold billions of dollars' worth of arms to Saudi Arabia and provides logistical and other support to the coalition.\n\nA renewed coalition offensive on Hodeida began five days ago. Dozens of fighters have been killed and hundreds wounded from both sides since the renewed offensive started. The fighting has left dead bodies lying on the ground and inside burnt-out vehicles at the city's edge, according to witnesses. They said several civilians have been killed by shelling in residential areas.\n\nA Save the Children-supported health facility in Hodeida came under attack on Tuesday morning, damaging one of the pharmacies that supply life-saving medicines, the charity said in a statement. The group said shelling has also hit residential areas in Hodeida, where the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, roughly half of them children, are in danger.\n\nThe head of the U.N.'s food and agriculture agency and other groups say the conflict has pushed Yemen to the brink of famine, underlining how the international community is failing to end hunger.\n\n\"We are watching before our eyes an unprecedented human tragedy,\" Food and Agriculture Organization chief Jose Graziano da Silva told a high-level briefing on food insecurity at the U.N. in New York.\n\n\"Yemen is living proof of an apocalyptical equation: conflicts and food security go hand in hand, and when there is an overlap of climate change and conflict, famine is already on the horizon,\" he said.", "Two states voted Tuesday to add anti-abortion language to their constitutions in what some opponents say is preparation for a potential overturn of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nVoters in Alabama and West Virginia approved state ballot measures that addressed the question of abortion and sought to ban public Medicaid funding of the procedure. Both measures stated their state's constitution did not protect a woman's right to an abortion and their state would not provide funding for the procedure, except in the case of rape, incest and medical emergency, as is required by federal law.\n\n\"It basically paves the way to ban abortion in all instances,\" Shante Wolfe-Sisson, the campaign manager for Alabama for Healthy Families, a group that opposed the initiative, said Wednesday in an interview with CBS News. \"In practice, it will sit in the Alabama constitution as a standing law so in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned, it will automatically become law.\"\n\nIn Alabama, voters agreed to amend the state constitution to include that its policy was to protect \"the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life\" and its official stance on abortion was to \"ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child in all manners and measures lawful and appropriate.\" Wolfe-Sisson says these changes would effectively outlaw pregnancy-ending procedures in the event Roe v. Wade gets overturned. Alabama State Rep. Mike Fridy, who sponsored the amendment, did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment.\n\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade prohibited states from banning abortion prior to fetus viability, securing a woman's right to access the procedure throughout the U.S. In recent years, a number of states have enacted measures such as waiting periods and restrictions on clinics that effectively reduce access to abortion without explicitly outlawing it.\n\nHowever, with a Republican White House and increasingly conservative Supreme Court, some believe that the days of Roe v. Wade may be numbered. During a 2016 presidential debate, then-candidate Donald Trump said he foresaw the ruling being overturned if he were elected because he planned to appoint pro-life judges. He stressed the issue again in a speech before the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nSo far, the Supreme Court has not agreed to hear a direct challenge to Roe. But if it eventually does so, and if a majority of the justices vote to overturn that precedent, it would be up to individual states to determine whether to restrict or outlaw abortion within its borders. Measures like the ones seen in Alabama and West Virginia are essentially preemptive, said Wolfe-Sisson; in the event that Roe v. Wade is dismantled, abortion will automatically become illegal in Alabama.\n\nWest Virginians voted for language that said the state constitution does not \"secure or protect\" a woman's right to abortion. The state ballot measure also outlawed the use of Medicaid dollars to pay for abortion except in the case of rape, incest and life endangerment, said Patricia Puertas Rucker, a Republican state senator in West Virginia and lead sponsor of the amendment.\n\n\"I believe that that's something that people who have conscious objection shouldn't have to pay for,\" Rucker told CBS News. Medicaid is jointly funded by states and the federal government. Federal law doesn't allow states to bar Medicaid funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger.\n\nIn a written statement, Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, called the latest state efforts an \"unprecedented effort to insert politics into health care.\"\n\nWest Virginia currently has laws on the books criminalizing abortion, attaching a penalty of three to 10 years of jail time for either performing or receiving the procedure. However, the laws are not in effect because both federal and state courts have found the state code to be unconstitutional.\n\nMeanwhile in Oregon, voters on Tuesday went the other direction, rejecting a proposal that would have cut state insurance funding for low-income women seeking abortions.", "Alec Baldwin is having a bad week. On Friday, the actor was arrested and charged with assault and harassment after allegedly hitting another man in the face during a dispute over a parking spot in New York City, and Tuesday, ABC announced \"The Alec Baldwin Show\" is being moved to a less favorable time slot.\n\nBaldwin's talk show has been airing Sunday nights at 10 p.m. ET, but beginning November 18, ABC will air repeat episodes of \"Shark Tank\" instead. \"The Alec Baldwin Show\" will return to air Saturdays at 10 p.m. ET starting Dec. 8.\n\nThough the former \"30 Rock\" star was able to nab big names for his long-form interviews, like Robert De Niro and Kim Kardashian West, the show performed poorly and is one of ABC's lowest-rated programs. It premiered in October with 2 million viewers and a 0.3 demo rating, and ratings have slipped since then. Baldwin also hosts \"Match Game\" at ABC.\n\nAfter news broke Baldwin reportedly hit another driver in New York, the actor tweeted from the account of the Hilaria and Alec Baldwin Foundation \"the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false. I wanted to go on the record stating as much.\"\n\nIn a second tweet, Baldwin complained it's become a \"sport\" to tag people with as many \"negative charges and defaming allegations as possible for the purposes of clickbait entertainment.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Fortunately, no matter how reverberating the echos, it doesn't make the statements true.\"\n\nBaldwin, 60, told police a family member was holding the spot in front of his Manhattan home when a man driving a Saab station wagon pulled up and took it. The driver of the station wagon told police Baldwin hit him with his hand, but he wasn't sure if it was a punch or a slap.", "", "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Voters in Nashville have overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure to create a community oversight board to investigate claims of misconduct against police officers, reports CBS affiliate WTVF. A coalition of social justice advocates pushed to place Amendment 1 on the ballot in part in response to a series of fatal shootings of black men by white Metropolitan Nashville police officers, reports the Tennessean.\n\nThe proposal was heavily opposed by the Nashville Fraternal Order of Police, the city's police union.\n\nThe measure, which would amend the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department's charter to form an 11-member panel with investigative powers to review alleged police misconduct, passed by a margin of 59 percent to 41 percent, according to the Tennessean. It would also have authority to make advisory recommendations for Nashville's criminal justice system, said Community Oversight Now, the advocacy group that organized the ballot measure.\n\nBoard members would be unpaid volunteers nominated to their posts and should have \"demonstrated knowledge of and/or experience with civil rights, policing, racial justice, criminal justice, or other similar issues,\" according to the group. Current and recently retired law enforcement and elected officials would not be eligible.\n\nCommunity Oversight Now was formed in February 2017 after a white Nashville police officer shot and killed 31-year-old Jocques Clemmons, who was black, after a traffic stop near an East Nashville public housing complex, according to the Tennessean. The killing prompted calls for justice from Clemmons' family and a demand for community police oversight. More recently, a white officer in July shot and killed 25-year-old Daniel Hambrick, who was black, as he ran away during a foot chase in North Nashville. The officer who killed Hambrick was charged with criminal homicide, while the officer in Clemmons' shooting was never criminally charged.\n\nCommunity Oversight Now reportedly collected more than 8,200 petition signatures in order for the citizen oversight board measure to be placed on the ballot. In a statement released to the paper, the group hailed Tuesday's vote as a \"historic moment.\"\n\n\"This victory is the outgrowth of a people's movement \u2014 the transformative energy of hundreds of volunteers and everyday people representing diverse racial and ethnic groups, faith traditions, young and old,\" the statement said.\n\nThe proposal drew strong support from black voters. Kiyala Hatcher, 20, told Nashville Public Radio it was her primary reason for voting.\n\n\"It would be helpful if we can have people be held accountable for their actions and not just a slap on the wrist,\" she said. \"I feel like it'll put a lot of people at ease.\"\n\nThe Nashville Fraternal Order of Police, which reportedly organized a well-financed opposition campaign to the measure, vowed in a statement to respect the will of the people. But the union said it \"remains firm in its belief that this board will only create a divide between law enforcement and the public.\"\n\nThe union had argued that the proposed $1.5 million operating budget for the community oversight board would negatively impact taxpayers.\n\n\"The endorsement of Amendment one to create an oversight board does nothing to undermine the professionalism that Nashvillians have come to know from their police officers and \u2013 although the FOP still believes that an expensive oversight board is an unnecessary redundancy that we simply cannot afford \u2013 we intend to work with the administration as it seeks to implement the amendment in the coming months,\" the statement said. \"Excluding the perspective of those who are on the front lines every day would do a disservice to both our members and the community at large.\"\n\nThe union has argued in court that supporters did not collect enough signatures to put the measure on the ballot; the Tennessean reports a state appeals court will take up the issue Dec. 5.\n\nNashville would join more than 120 police jurisdictions across the country that are subject to some form of community oversight board, according to the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Baltimore, New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, New Orleans, Miami, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Washington, D.C.", "", "Voters in Washington state approved one of the toughest gun control laws in the country. The measure increases the age limit to buy a pistol or semi-automatic assault rifle from 18 to 21, imposes a 10-day waiting period for purchases, and increases background checks.\n\nAccording to CBS affiliate KIRO-TV, Initiative 1639 passed with 60 percent approval. In addition to the change in purchase age, the initiative prohibits anyone who is not a Washington resident from buying a semi-automatic assault rifle in the state. In addition, it holds gun owners responsible for safely storing their firearms.\n\nSupporters said the goal is to make schools and communities safer by putting checks in place to keep weapons out of dangerous hands. One of the initiative's supporters is Paul Kramer, whose son was wounded in a shooting at a party in Mukilteo, Washington, in 2016. The gunman legally purchased the weapon used in the shooting when he was 19.\n\n\"If Initiative 1639 had been in place in 2016, he would not have been able to purchase the semi-automatic assault rifle that allowed him to seriously injure my son and kill three of his close friends,\" Kramer said in September.\n\nOpponents argued the law puts people at risk by restricting access to guns for self-defense.\n\nAnother measure that won approval in Washington is Initiative 940, which makes it easier to prosecute police for negligent shootings. It aims to improve police training in de-escalation tactics and eliminates a requirement that prosecutors prove officers acted with malice to get a conviction in negligent shootings.\n\nResearch released earlier this year found strong state firearm laws were associated with lower rates of firearm-related homicide. However, little data exists on the impact of gun control laws because in 1996, Congress passed a law limiting the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ability to study gun violence.", "Voters in two Republican-led states gave themselves a raise on Election Day, approving ballot measures in Tuesday's midterm elections that will boost pay for about 1 million workers.\n\nMissouri voters approved a measure to gradually boost the state's minimum wage from its current $7.85 per hour to $12 an hour by 2023. The raise will lift wages for about 677,000 workers, according an analysis from the National Employment Law Project.\n\nIn Arkansas, the minimum wage will gradually rise from $8.50 an hour now to $11 in 2021. That boost will impact 300,000 workers, NELP estimates.\n\nThe measures come as incomes for many low- and middle-income workers have been stagnating, while corporate profits and executive pay have been soaring. While Republican lawmakers typically argue against a higher minimum wage on the grounds it could make businesses less competitive, the issue is gaining support among voters, with a majority of both Republicans and Democrats saying they believe the federal baseline wage of $7.25 an hour should be higher.\n\nSupporters of higher pay for low-wage workers called the ballot measures a victory that highlights a growing gulf between voters and lawmakers.\n\n\"When it comes to the minimum wage, the biggest gap isn't between Republicans and Democrats; it's between politicians who don't want to raise the wage and the people they represent,\" said Jonathan Schleifer, executive director of the Fairness Project, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. The Fairness Project is an advocacy group that supported the measures.\n\nMissouri minimum wage battle offers lessons\n\nThe Missouri vote is notable partly because the minimum wage was at the center of a high-profile battle last year. In that case, city leaders in St. Louis and Kansas City had passed ordinances to boost local baseline wages, but Missouri's Republican-led General Assembly issued a preemption law, which meant the cities had to obey the state law when it came to the minimum wage. In some cases, wage hikes were rescinded for low-wage employees.\n\nThe federal minimum wage hasn't seen an increase since 2009, when it rose from $6.55 to $7.25 an hour. Yet costs for essentials such as health care and housing have surged since then, with inflation reducing its spending power by more than 12 percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nPay for the top 1 percent of American workers has soared, however. In 20017, annual wages for top earners rose 3.7 percent, but the bottom 90 percent of workers saw wage gains of 1 percent, EPI found. The difference is even more striking when examining pay growth since the late 1970s: The top 1 percent's income has surged more than 157 percent, or about 7 times more than that of the bottom 90 percent.\n\nBecause the federal minimum wage doesn't appear likely to receive a boost under the Trump administration, state and municipal lawmakers are enacting local laws to push up the baseline pay rate. Currently, 29 states and Washington, D.C., have higher minimum wages than the federal rate, according to EPI. The bulk of those increases have come within the last four years, with 23 states pushing up their minimum wage laws since 2014.\n\nLousiana vote next?\n\nOn the heels of the success of the measures in Missouri and Arkansas, Louisiana Governor Jon Bel Edwards said it was time for his state to consider a similar move.\n\n\"2 conservative leaning states approved a minimum wage increase last night - AR & MO,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"It's time for a modest increase in LA!\"", "", "With reporting from Jennifer De Pinto\n\nAn estimated 113 million people participated in the 2018 midterm elections, making this the first midterm in history to exceed over 100 million votes, with 49 percent of eligible voters participating in the election. By comparison, the 2014 midterm elections had one of the lowest turnouts in American history, with only 36.4 percent of eligible voters participating. In 2010, the first midterm of President Obama's tenure, 41 percent of voters participated.\n\nUniversity of Florida associate professor Michael McDonald, who oversees the Election Project, told \"Red & Blue\" on CBSN last week that the last time voter turnout reached 49 percent was in the 1966 midterm elections.\n\n\"In the last three decades, we've had about 40 percent of those eligible to vote participating in midterm elections. If we get in the upper end of that range, if we can beat the 1966 49-percent turnout rate, you'd have to go all the way back to 1914 to get a turnout rate above 50 percent,\" McDonald said last week.\n\nEarly voting totals were an indication of greater voter turnout come election day. Early voting totals in 27 states have exceeded total early votes in the 2014 midterm election, according to data from the University of Florida Elections Project.\n\nDemocrats gained a net 27 seats in the House of Representatives, gaining control of the chamber, while Republicans expanded their majority by gaining a net two seats in the Senate.

The New Mexico Film Office confirmed that \"Greenbrier,\" produced by Sony Pictures, will begin production in Albuquerque in mid-November through early February.\n\nGilligan signed a three-year deal with Sony TV in July; the \"Breaking Bad\" movie would be his first project since the agreement.\n\nIn June, the cast of \"Breaking Bad\" reunited with Gilligan for the show's 10th anniversary. They teamed up for a feature story in Entertainment Weekly, with stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul joined by Bob Odenkirk, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, Giancarlo Esposito, Jonathan Banks, and RJ Mitte.\n\nCranston told Entertainment Weekly that he found the reunion emotional.\n\n\"You can't just move on,\" he said. \"Something that was so indelible and meaningful in your life and you can't, and I don't want to. I want to hold on to those good memories of that gathering, both then and during our seven years together. So, it's a bit melancholy, actually. Bittersweet.\"\n\nBrandt said of the reunion, \"I knew I would laugh, and I knew I would cry.\"\n\nPaul said he still couldn't believe he was part of the show.\n\n\"I love these people,\" he said. \"I feel blessed to have shared this incredible experience that is 'Breaking Bad' with each and every one of these people.

We wouldn't have the possibility of doing it on a party-line basis.\"\n\nAnd now, McConnell said he does not see a path to repealing the Affordable Care Act now that Democrats control the House. \"The Democratic House is not going to be interested in that,\" he said.\n\nMore broadly, he warned the Democratic-led House against focusing on investigating President Trump. \"The Democrats in the House will have to decide just how much presidential harassment they think is good strategy,\" he said. \"I'm not so sure it will work for them.\"\n\nMcConnell said he spoke with Pelosi Tuesday night to discuss \"how to find a way forward.\"\n\n\"We're not unfamiliar with each other and we'll probably have a lot more dealings with each other in the future,\" he added.\n\nAssessing the role of Mr. Trump in the midterm elections, McConnell said his campaigning was \"extremely helpful....He worked very hard, drew large crowds, and I think it clearly had a positive impact on the outcome.\"\n\nHe also took note of an apparent \"Kavanaugh effect\" in the races, referring to the political impact of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's contentious confirmation process in rallying the base. \"Very helpful. I think the Republicans -- sort of core voters -- in the states that were critical of us were highly offended by the questioning of the presumption of innocence and the tactics.\"\n\nMcConnell also said that for the remainder of the current legislative session he hopes to finish work on funding of the government. Asked if he sees a government shutdown, McConnell said \"hopefully we will not be headed down that path.\" The president has threatened to shut down the government if Congress does not fund the southern border wall he wants. Funding for the department that oversees border security, DHS, expires Dec. 8.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.", "Saudi King Salman embarked on an unprecedented domestic tour on Tuesday as the country grapples with an international crisis over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The bonuses had been suspended under austerity measures in 2016 amid low oil prices.\n\nIn recent weeks, Saudi nationalists have sought to rally around the prince with adulatory poems and songs on social media, as local officials have dismissed the Khashoggi crisis as a Western conspiracy.", "", "For stores, Black Friday looks like the survival of the fittest this year. On the day after Thanksgiving, customers traditionally rushed in retailers' doors, but with major merchants going out of business or shuttering mall locations, retailers are rushing out the door to find shoppers.\n\nThose \"doorbuster specials\" will still be there as megastores like Kohl's, Target and Walmart attempt to create scarcity and excitement with those \"first 100 customers to buy a flat screen\" prices. But online shoppers may find those prices aren't that special. In fact, they may already have purchased some pre-Black Friday deals, which started at the beginning of November.\n\n\"The historic Black Friday is ebbing,\" said Fitch Ratings retail analyst David Silverman. \"It's not as necessary as it once was.\"\n\nAmerica's post-Thanksgiving Day shopping frenzy used to start off with bang -- literally sometimes -- as frantic customers celebrated by knocking down security guards and fighting each other to grab toys and electronics. But now the drama (and the media coverage) is likely to be more muted.\n\n\"There will still be an uptick in sales that day,\" predicted Managing Director Jeff Holzmann of Iintoo, a commercial real estate company. \"But you probably won't see elbows flying.\"\n\nBig names disappear or shrink\n\nThe brick-and-mortar retail sector has sustained major damage. Stand-alone stores like Toys R Us are gone, and many \"anchor stores\" at malls, such as Sears, are shutting down. Other retailers like Gap, JCPenney, Lord & Taylor, Macy's and Michael Kors are cutting back on locations. Even home-improvement chain Lowes is closing many stores in the U.S. and Canada, while offering a 40 percent discount on some appliances.\n\nIt's a scary time for retailers, due in part to a phenomenon known as \"cascading,\" or unplanned markdowns. \"Every company has prepared for promotional markdowns during the Christmas season, and they'll grow as you get closer to the holiday,\" said Fitch's Silverman. \"But unplanned markdowns happen when the merchant at the other end of the mall is going out of business, closing the store or simply has to dump inventory whose shelf life has expired. Then everyone has to cut prices and keep lowering them.\"\n\nShrewd merchants have already done this, which is why the Christmas shopping season has begun earlier. The rush is on to beat \"antiquated retailers\" that still believe Black Friday is the busiest day of the year for a shopper's credit card, said Jonathan Cherki, CEO of ContentSquare, a software provider for retailers.\n\nMajor chains used to believe that the post-Thanksgiving holiday was special because it was the date when their balance sheets finally turned from red (losses) to black (profits). Now they see it simply as part of a continuum that starts right after Halloween and continues through the actual holiday -- as more shoppers click online shopping sites even as the turkey is still on the table.\n\nThis trend follows through to New Year's Day as retailers get returns and, they hope, sell a few more items at the same time. That's one reason Kohl's said it will take Amazon's returns, said Silverman. \"Once you get them in the store, there's a 25 percent chance they'll buy something else.\"\n\nGet in the \"Ama-zone\" or perish\n\nAs America's largest online retailer, Amazon remains the elephant in the room, and stores in shopping centers have to get in the \"Ama-zone\" or perish, analysts said. One way is to dispel the traditional Black Friday myth that only a certain amount of inventory is available, and you have to buy it that day to get that price.\n\nThe key words are \"virtual inventory,\" said CEO Frank Poore of Commercehub, which helps online businesses manage their stock. Savvy shoppers can always look online, find the toy or electronics they want and keep clicking until the price drops. Retail stores have to provide the same services as online retailers, such as offering to get items that aren't in-store from another store and providing immediate home delivery after those \"first hundred\" are gone. Otherwise, they'll lose customers to someone else.\n\nWhen Amazon upped the ante by offering free shipping on holiday orders, other retailers had to follow suit. Chief Technology Officer Alex Shvarts of FundKite, a business funding platform, noted that Black Friday store traffic drops by 5 percent to 10 percent a year, while UPS, which shipped roughly 750 million packages during the 2017 holiday season, expects that number to increase by the same rate. The U.S. Postal Service anticipates even more business -- a billion parcels this holiday season.\n\nFor stores to survive, they need to be more customer-friendly, while malls have to provide services like easy or valet parking, and amenities such as free coffee and child care, foot massages and immediate product usage, said analysts. They need to do the things an online retailer can't -- and respect the customer.\n\n\"Black Friday was never an experience that most people enjoyed,\" said Iintoo's Holzmann. Fitch's Silverman agrees. \"Customers want to shop with intelligence, not with fisticuffs.\" Millennials in particular have different buying habits. \"They'd rather have something personal and handmade than a mass-produced item from overseas,\" said FundKite's Shvarts.\n\nFewer competitors\n\nRetailers that have survived the wars with Amazon -- and each other -- have hope. As their numbers dwindle, they'll see fewer of those \"cascading markdowns\" because most of the losers will already be out of business.\n\nAnd the rest will pick up inventory and brand names from the ones that failed. Kroger is already offering 600 Toys R Us \"pop-up shops\" with Toys' mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe, and Walmart is enlarging its already huge toy department.\n\nMany retailers may actually end up \"in the black\" on that Friday after all.", "Motel 6 has been agreed to pay up to $7.6 million to Hispanic guests to settle a lawsuit claiming it violated their privacy by sharing guest lists with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, according to reports.\n\nThe company also agreed to a two-year consent decree that bars it from providing guest data to immigration authorities without subpoenas, warrants or threats of serious crime or harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe agreement still needs court approval.\n\n\"Plaintiffs and Motel 6 have filed a proposed settlement agreement that would resolve the lawsuit between the two parties if it is approved by the district court,\" Motel 6 and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) said in a joint statement.\n\nThe Phoenix New Times reported in September last year, citing court records, that ICE agents made at least 20 arrests at two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix between February and August 2017.

The president also talked about Republican candidates like Reps. Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Pete Roskam of Illinois, who eschewed the Trump \"embrace,\" and he suggested this may have been a contributing factor to their losses.\n\n\"On the other hand you had some that decided to let's stay away, let's stay away,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They did very poorly.

However, 49 percent also said their family's financial position is \"about the same\" as it was two years ago.\n\nHobson attributed that discrepancy to stagnant wages and the fact that President Trump's tax cut largely affected corporate America, not individuals.\n\n\"I love that saying that Warren Buffett has that markets are stronger than governments.

However, orca whales, or killer whales as they are often called, can fetch as much as $6 million at theme parks in China.\n\nRussian newspaper Novaya Gazetta has reported that the four companies that own the containers exported 13 whales to China between 2013 and 2016.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2015, the companies allegedly involved were granted permission to capture ten orcas in the wild for educational purposes. However, seven of those whales were exported to China, where one was valued at over $1 million on a customs form.\n\nEarlier this year, Russian authorities called on the Interior Ministry to launch a fraud investigation over the capture and sale of the seven whales.\n\nOther firms are reportedly renting out whales in an effort to get around certain restrictions on the sale of wild sea mammals.\n\nVideo shot from a helicopter of the containment tanks shows dozens of beluga whales in tight quarters. Experts say that given the size of the tanks, many of the whales must be calves. The capture of whale calves is categorically forbidden, even for scientific or educational reasons.\n\nGreenpeace Russia has condemned the conditions as \"torture,\" and warned that capturing whales in these numbers threatens the animals' population in the long term.\n\nThe Telegraph quoted Greenpeace Russia's Oganes Targulyan as saying that although the law permits the capture of 13 killer whales per year, \"no one is taking into account that at least one orca is killed for every one that is caught.\"\n\n\"Catching them at this tempo, we risk losing our entire orca population.\"\n\nIn the nearby Kamchatka region, orca numbers have decreased so drastically that they are now listed as endangered.", "", "LONDON - Wall Street is set to open higher Wednesday after the U.S. midterm elections showed the Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives and the Republicans keeping a majority in the Senate.\n\nThough the election results increase the potential for political gridlock in Washington, traders were mostly expecting this outcome, so markets haven't been as volatile as after other political events, such as the 2016 presidential vote.\n\nOne reason Wall Street is less worried about this election is history: Every midterm election over the past 60 years has been followed by a rise in stocks, sometimes called a \"relief rally,\" market research shows.\n\nOver the past 50 years, the S&P 500 has jumped an average of 16 percent following a midterm election, according to Capital Economics.\n\nHistory doesn't predict the future, but the post-midterm trends may offer solace to investors whipsawed by the volatile trading last month.

Democrats, though, have long said the Republicans ignored a string of key facts and witnesses.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denies any involvement in Mr. Trump's election victory, but he may quietly favor renewed investigations, seeing them as a way to sow chaos and division in America's bitterly divided political arena. What he would not favor, though, would be investigations or sanctions that damage the well-connected Russian oligarchs believed to have helped fund the meddling efforts.\n\nAfter the election results, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament said the Democratic win in the House would raise the pressure on Mr. Trump.\n\nKonstantin Kosachev said in televised comments that Trump will face \"unpleasant challenges - emotional at a minimum and political at a maximum.\"\n\nHe said Mr. Trump would likely face strong Democratic resistance to any of his reforms, but added that the Republicans' continued control of the Senate saved Mr. Trump from a \"real catastrophe with a looming threat of impeachment.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nThen there's Saudi Arabia, and the relationship between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

The U.S. assists the Saudi-led coalition with in-air refuelling and intelligence on targets, and supplies the kingdom with fighter jets and bombs used in the war.\n\nThe conflict has become widely unpopular with some members of Congress and has created the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe, according to aid agencies.\n\nEurope\n\nThe European Union's deputy chief executive has lauded the Democrats' reclamation of a majority in the House of Representatives, while also taking a thinly veiled jab at \"rudeness\" and \"racism\" he linked to Mr. Trump's leadership.\n\n\"Inspired by voters in the U.S. who chose hope over fear, civility over rudeness, inclusion over racism, equality over discrimination,\" Frans Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who is first vice president of the European Commission, said in a tweet.\n\nInspired by voters in the US who chose hope over fear, civility over rudeness, inclusion over racism, equality over discrimination.

The CH-7 unmanned aerial vehicle also underscores China's growing competitiveness in the expanding global market for drones.\n\nChina has won sales in the Middle East and elsewhere by offering drones at lower prices and without the political conditions attached by the U.S.\n\nThe CH-7's chief designer Shi Wen says the aircraft can \"fly long hours, scout and strike the target when necessary.\"\n\n\"Very soon, I believe, in the next one to two years, (we) can see the CH-7 flying in the blue skies, gradually being a practical and usable product in the future,\" Shi told The Associated Press.\n\nShi said manufacturer Chinese Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation plans to test fly the drone next year and begin mass production by 2022. He said the drone will likely be sold abroad but had no information on potential clients.\n\nGetty\n\nA model of the aircraft is being displayed at this week's Zhuhai air show in southern China, a biannual event that showcases China's latest advancements in military and civilian aviation.\n\nWith a wingspan of 22 meters (72 feet) and a length of 10 meters (33 feet), the swept-wing CH-7 is the size of a combat aircraft and its single engine can propel it at roughly the speed of a commercial jet airliner.\n\nThe U.S., Russia and France are also developing stealth drones, while Israel has long been a leader in the UAV field.\n\nHowever, low prices and a willingness to transfer technology have endowed China with a \"strong position,\" in the UAV market, said Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at the Teal Group Corp. in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nThe U.S. has been extremely cautious about selling its higher-end unmanned system, even to NATO member states, opening up an opportunity to China in the export market, said Justin Bronk, an export on such technologies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London.\n\n\"It would represent an area of Chinese arms export offerings which no other country offers,\" Bronk said.\n\nAlongside its development of stealth fighters and commercial passenger jets, China has advanced rapidly in the development of UAVs, which have a relatively lower technological entry cost. Sales have also been boosted by the fact that China is not a signatory to the Missile Technology Control Regime that restricts exports of missiles and other unmanned weapons systems.\n\nThe numbers of drone programs unveiled in China in recent years has been \"dizzying,\" said Sam Roggeveen, director of the international security program at Australia's Lowy Institute.\n\nWhile the CH-7's ultimate effectiveness remains to be determined, if exported, it would \"mark another step-change for China, which has traditionally not offered its cutting-edge technology to foreign customers,\" Roggeveen said.\n\nAcross the Middle East, countries locked out of purchasing U.S.-made drones due to rules over excessive civilian casualties are being wooed by Chinese arms dealers, now the world's main distributor of armed drones.\n\nThe sales are helping expand Chinese influence across a region crucial to American security interests and bolstering Beijing's ambitions to lead in high-tech arms sales.\n\nWhile the U.S. still holds a technology advantage, China wins on price. The fact it is willing to sell the CH-7 abroad could indicate the technology is less than cutting edge, given China's desire to guard its technological edge in such areas, said Ron Huisken, a regional security expert at Australian National University.\n\nChina's exports also underscore the growing pervasiveness of drones in modern warfare, even without strong international agreements on where and how they can be used.\n\n\"One wonders what nasty surprises are in store as countries more casual about how they use drones and less strict about training standards get their hands on them,\" said Huisken.\n\nAlso appearing again at this year's Zhuhai show was China's homebuilt J-20 stealth fighter, which outwardly resembles the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor in service with the U.S. military.\n\nIt was joined by the Chinese J-10B fighter with vectoring thrust, featuring an engine equipped with a hinged nozzle. Vectoring thrust technology allows planes to direct their propulsion, giving it more flexibility in maneuvering, and the substation of Chinese-made WS-10 engines for those imported from Russia appears to mark a new milestone for the domestic defense industry.\n\nThe jet fighters on display thrilled spectators. For many, the performances demonstrated China's burgeoning aerospace industry and growing confidence in its technology.\n\n\"I think it is pretty awesome,\" said Xie Dongni, a marketer for an information technology company.\n\n\"I might not a plane specialist, but I can feel the way China is changing.

The North stopped short of threatening to abandon ongoing nuclear negotiations with Washington.\n\nDiplomatic sources told CBS News reporter Kylie Atwood as recently as Monday that senior State Department officials were still confident in the plans for Pompeo's now-delayed meeting in New York. The State Department is keen to kick off working level talks with the North Korean side, which Pompeo said the North had agreed to during their last meeting. But that was in early October, and since then there have been no working level discussions.\n\nAtwood also noted that North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA has recently put out aggressive messages saying the Kim regime only suspended its nuclear testing with the expectation that the U.S. would begin easing sanctions.\n\nAs CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy has noted from Beijing, the Trump administration thus far has stuck by its stance that sanctions against North Korea will only be dropped once denuclearization is achieved, or at least demonstrably underway.\n\nOngoing U.S. joint military exercises with South Korea, although smaller than previous war games, and the fact that Pyongyang had been hoping for earlier sanctions relief, both prompted the North Korean delegation to decide to skip the planned meeting with Pompeo in New York this week, two diplomatic sources told CBS News' Pamela Falk at the United Nations.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russia asked China to schedule a closed-door meeting of the U.N.

Pelosi noted that she'd be criticized within her own party for not pushing harder on the issue.\n\nShe's not the only top Democrat so far to dismiss the idea of impeachment. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is widely considered a potential 2020 contender, told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Nora O'Donnell last month that he hoped Democrats don't try right away.\n\n\"I don't think there's a basis for doing that right now,\" Biden said. He, too, said Democrats should wait until Mueller's report comes out.\n\nImpeachment also wasn't a central issue for Democrats during the campaign, with little if any serious discussion about it coming from candidates.\n\nBut even if no impeachment effort starts soon, the Democratic control of the House gives the party something that could lead to one: investigative power.\n\nHouse Democrats will have subpoena power and will be able to investigate every facet of Trump's presidency and business career. Some Democrats, such as the likely next House Intelligence Committee chairman, California's Adam Schiff, have indicated they want more answers on potential collusion with Russia on election interference. The House Ways and Means Committee, which Rep. Richard Neal (D-Ma.) is in line to head, could try to get Mr. Trump's tax returns, which he has avoided releasing.\n\nOther House committees could investigate any future scandal that comes out of the Trump White House. Axios in August reported that Republicans were keeping a spreadsheet of investigations Democrats would likely launch if they took the House. It includes about 20 potential topics, including FBI Director James Comey's firing, the hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, the migrant family separation policy and the response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. CBS News has not independently confirmed the authenticity of that list.\n\nBut even if House Democrats start going down the impeachment trail, Mr. Trump still has the Senate on his side, which could save his presidency. The House impeaches presidents, but the Senate votes on whether to remove an impeached president from office.\n\nRepublicans still control the Senate after Tuesday's midterms. And the Senate has never voted to remove a president. Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, the only two presidents to be impeached, were both acquitted by the Senate \u2014 the latter by a single vote.", "YAOUNDE, Cameroon -- A church official in Cameroon says that the 79 students kidnapped by unidentified gunmen have been released, but two of the three staff members abducted are still being held. Fonki Samuel Forba, moderator of Cameroon's Presbyterian Church, said Wednesday that the schoolchildren, who had been kidnapped Sunday night from a church school, had been left at a church near Bamenda, the capital of the troubled English-speaking North West region.\n\nHe said the students looked tired and as if they had suffered during their captivity.\n\nHe pleaded with the kidnappers to free the staff still held. He had asked parents and guardians to take home all their children. He said the Presbyterian boarding school with 700 students is being closed because of the security situation.\n\nA video purportedly of the kidnapped children was released on social media Sunday via men who call themselves Amba boys, a reference to the state of Ambazonia which armed separatists are trying to establish in Cameroon's northwest and southwest regions.\n\nIn the video, the kidnappers forced several of the young male students to give their names and the names of their parents. The children said they were kidnapped late Sunday by the Amba boys, and they don't know where they are being held.\n\n\"We shall only release you after the struggle. You will be going to school now here,\" say the men who identified themselves as Amba boys. While the video could not be independently verified, parents reacted on social media saying they recognized their children in the video.\n\nHundreds have been killed in Cameroon's Anglophone regions in the past year, where violence between armed separatists and the military has increased since a government crackdown against protesters in the northwest and southwest regions, who claim that as the English-speaking minority they are marginalized by the French-speaking government.\n\nLast week separatist militants attacked workers on a state-run rubber plantation in restive southwestern Cameroon, chopping off their fingers because the men had defied an order to stay away from the farms.\n\nAn American missionary also died in the northwest region around Bamenda after he was shot in the head amid fighting between armed separatists and soldiers.\n\nThe turmoil in Cameroon comes as President Paul Biya, who has held his office since 1982, easily won a seventh term last month in an election that the United States says was marked by irregularities.

The 116th Congress will also be significantly more diverse than its predecessor.\n\nSharice Davids and Deb Haaland will be the first Native American women to go to Congress. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar will be the first Muslim women in Congress. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29 years of age, is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.

In California, Young Kim will become the first Korean-American woman in Congress.\n\nThe Kavanaugh effect?\n\nWhat do Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly, Bill Nelson, and Claire McCaskill have in common? They all represent states Mr. Trump won, and they all voted against confirming Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh last month. Meanwhile, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin \u2014 the only Democrat to vote in favor of Kavanaugh -- was reelected.\n\nYoung voters turn out\n\nNew voters almost certainly helped Democrats retake the House. According to CBS News exit polling, 17 percent of those who turned out this election were new voters. In the 2010 midterms, just 3 percent were new voters. Also, more self-identified Democrats than Republicans headed to the polls this year (37 to 33 percent). This represents a shift from 2014 midterms, when more Republicans showed up at the polls (36 to 35 percent).\n\nIndependent voters, who flipped their partisan preference sharply compared to the last midterms in 2014, were another big factor in this election. In 2014, they leaned Republican by 12 points, but in this election they supported Democrats by 12 points.\n\nVoters shrug off criminal allegations\n\nSen. Bob Menendez and Reps. Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter have all been accused of crimes by the federal government. Menendez was charged with corruption in a case that eventually ended in a mistrial. Collins was arrested by the FBI in August for insider trading. And Hunter was indicted in August for campaign finance violations and wire fraud.\n\nAll three incumbents were reelected Tuesday night.\n\nDemocrats win the House and some governorships\n\nSure, they lost a high-profile gubernatorial race in Florida, but Democrats flipped control of other states formerly led by a Republican executive. Democrats won gubernatorial races in New Mexico, Illinois, Michigan, Maine, and notably the deep-red state of Kansas.\n\nSome major ballot initiatives\n\n\n\nIn Florida, voters re-enfranchised 1.4 million felons who had had their voting rights taken away. The ballot measure gave voting rights back to all Florida felons with the exception of those convicted of murder or sex crimes.\n\nIn Michigan, voters said yes to legalizing the use of recreational marijuana. And in Alabama, voters supported a ballot measure stating that personhood begins at conception, potentially setting up a legal battle over abortion rights.\n\nWelcome to gridlock\n\nIf President Trump decried Democrat \"obstruction\" before, he certainly will be now. Democratic control of the House means the president will have a much tougher time moving his agenda through Congress legislatively. Either the president will have to work more closely with Democrats or possibly turn more to governing through executive order, as he has threatened to do to end birthright citizenship. Or his agenda will simply be stalled.\n\nDemocratic control also means the president and his administration will face a slew of investigations from congressional committees, which will soon be led by Democrats. From tax returns to EPA regulations, the president and his cabinet are going to have to stay on their toes.\n\nHowever, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who has already spoken with Mr. Trump, suggested that there's room for the two parties to work together. \"We have all had enough of division,\" she said in her victory speech Tuesday night. \"Americans want peace. They want results.\" She suggested Democrats and Republicans might agree on a way to bring down the price of prescription drugs and to deliver infrastructure investment.", "Democrats' takeover of the House ended two years of full GOP control in Washington, during which \u2014 theoretically speaking \u2014 President Trump had full rein to implement his conservative agenda. But as Mr. Trump learned the hard way with Republicans' failure to fully repeal Obamacare, and his inability to secure anywhere near sufficient funding for a border wall, even full Republican control of both chambers of Congress and the White House isn't always enough.\n\nWhile the president has long complained of Democrats' \"obstruction,\" despite Republicans controlling Congress, the last two years of working the system will be a breeze compared to what the next two likely will be.\n\nMr. Trump, who wants to pass a second wave of tax cuts and end birthright citizenship, will find it much harder to accomplish those things legislatively. Democrats can quite easily block the president's desired agenda. Mr. Trump himself admitted the 10 percent tax cuts he wanted for the middle class likely won't happen without Republicans at the helm.\n\nThat leaves the president with few options. He could compromise with them \u2014 one of Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's aides said Mr. Trump expressed to her that he liked her message of bipartisanship in her victory speech Tuesday. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said he thinks legislation on prison reform and infrastructure has a good chance of passing. Mr. Trump himself mentioned infrastructure and drug pricing in a press conference that was quite laudatory of Pelosi, a stark contrast from his caustic words on the campaign trail.\n\nBut anything much more controversial than that might not.\n\nIf there are roadblocks on Capitol Hill, the president could take executive action, a power he has resorted to before, despite his frequent criticism of former President Obama for the same thing. Mr. Trump, who worked to deregulate industries and dismantle Obama-era programs through executive order, has already threatened to end birthright citizenship with his signature.\n\n\"I believe that you can have a simple vote in Congress, or it's even possible, in my opinion \u2014 this is after meeting with some very talented legal scholars \u2014 that you can do it through an executive order,\" Mr. Trump said last week about birthright citizenship. \"Now, I'd rather do it through Congress, because that's permanent. But we can certainly do it through \u2014 I really believe we can do it through executive order.\"\n\nDemocrats' control of the House also means they will run all of the lower chamber's committees. From the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to the House Ways and Means Committee, Democrats will control the agenda, the schedules, and what kind of investigations they pursue.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, that means Democrats will have every opportunity to obtain the president's tax returns, which he has refused to hand over since before the election. Democrats are also poised to launch or continue probes into the president's businesses and potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Trump never fully divested from his businesses upon assuming office, and Democrats are unsatisfied with the lack of information on how the president and his family might be profiting from transactions the public can't see. Litigation is already pending claiming foreign payments to Mr. Trump's businesses violate the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nBut Mr. Trump isn't the only Republican in the executive branch with cause for concern \u2014 Democrats are also poised to launch or continue probes into Cabinet-level secretaries and federal agencies.\n\nThe Democrats who won Tuesday night take office in January.", "This was a House election centered around sharply polarized reactions to the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nExit polling shows that over two-thirds of voters explicitly said that one reason for the vote for the U.S. Senate had to do with President Trump. Over a third of voters (38 percent) attributed their vote partially to opposing Trump, and almost all of them said they voted for the Democratic candidate. Of the 26 percent of voters who said that a reason for their vote was to support Trump, the vast majority voted for a Republican candidate.\n\nLooking at opinions of Mr. Trump among all voters, only 44 percent of approved his job performance, with 54 disapproving. Among disapprovers, 90 percent voted for the Democratic House candidate. A similar 88 percent of those who approved of Trump voted for the Republican House candidate.\n\nIncreased representation of Democrats at the polls also contributed to Democratic victories in the House. More self-identified Democrats than Republicans headed to the polls this year (37 to 33 percent). This represents a shift from 2014 midterm election, when more Republicans showed up at the polls (36 to 35 percent).\n\nWhile these partisan voters continued to display high levels of party loyalty in this year's House elections, independent voters flipped their partisan preference sharply compared to 2014. That year, they leaned Republican by 12 points, but this election they supported Democrats by 12 points.\n\nGiven this composition of the electorate, not surprisingly, more voters reported having a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party (49 percent) than the Republican Party (43 percent).\n\nNew voters also played an important role in Democrats winning the House. Seventeen percent of voters were first-time voters, and the majority of these voters cast their House ballot for the Democratic candidate.\n\nKey issues on the minds of voters also favored Democrats. The issue most commonly mentioned by voters as the most important one facing the country was health care (42 percent), and among voters who said so, 76 percent voted for the Democratic candidate for the House.\n\nVoters concerned with immigration favored Republican candidates, but only half as many voters picked this issue as most important.\n\nA majority (70 percent ) of today's voters say that the health care system needs major changes, and a clear majority of them favored Democratic candidates. By a margin of 58 to 34, voters said that the Democratic Party would be better able to protect people with pre-existing conditions. Not surprisingly, the overwhelming majority of these voters supported Democratic candidates.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV.

Jared Polis defeated Republican state Treasurer Walker Stapleton to keep the governor's seat in Democratic hands.\n\nPolis, 43, is a five-term congressman and technology entrepreneur who promised to fight for universal health care, renewable energy standards and publicly funded preschool and kindergarten. He vowed to stand up to President Trump's efforts to dismantle former President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act. Polis will succeed the term-limited John Hickenlooper.\n\nStapleton is a two-term state treasurer who campaigned on defending Colorado's constitutional restrictions on taxing and spending. The 44-year-old Stapleton insisted Polis' ideas for funding K-12 education, roads and energy would bankrupt the state.\n\nColorado has not had a Republican governor since 2007. The state has one of the nation's lowest unemployment rates and highest rates of economic growth, largely fueled by the tech, aerospace and oil and gas industries.\n\nGetty\n\nPolis banked on defending Obama's health care law and riding a wave of anti-Trump sentiment in a state that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and saw overwhelming Democratic turnout in June's party primaries.\n\nStapleton sought to court unaffiliated voters, Colorado's largest voting bloc, by insisting that Polis would jeopardize economic growth with costly and ill-defined proposals to fund schools and roads and expand health care. He also portrayed himself as a defender of conservative fiscal policies that underlie that growth. Polis repeatedly promised to build bipartisan coalitions to invest in underfunded roads and public schools \u2014 suggesting the time has come to ask Colorado residents to loosen their strict constitutional limits on taxes and spending.\n\nHealth care was a top issue in the race. Many Colorado rural and mountain towns pay some of the nation's highest insurance premiums \u2014 and have only one provider \u2014 under the Affordable Care Act. Polis, endorsed by single-payer health care proponent and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, unapologetically called for universal health care coverage as a long-term goal and suggested a first step might be to create a regional market with neighboring states.\n\nStapleton praised President Trump's elimination of tax penalties for those without health insurance but said he would defend an expanded Medicaid program that covers one in four Colorado residents.\n\nMr. Trump endorsed Stapleton, who embraced the administration's antipathy toward so-called sanctuary cities that don't closely cooperate with federal immigration authorities. But Stapleton sought to distance himself from the president in the campaign's final weeks, arguing that Trump's scornful tweets about immigrants, women and minorities had no bearing on policy in the governor's race.\n\nThe 2018 midterms saw 26 LGBTQ candidates run for office. That includes Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, the Senate's first openly gay member, although she never made fighting for LGBTQ rights a central part of her platform.

The GOP, meanwhile, is projected to keep control of the Senate.\n\nDemocrats last had a majority in the House in 2010. With their victory on Tuesday, Democrats will take over the leadership of key committees that could launch numerous investigations into the Trump White House. Democrats will also be able to provide a check on the administration's priorities, such as tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nDemocratic candidates had fundraising advantages in dozens of close contests heading into Election Day. Republicans had hoped that a strong economy and Mr. Trump's ability to turn out base voters would be enough to overcome high levels of enthusiasm among Democratic voters. But in the end Democrats triumphed, ending a brief era of unified Republican government.\n\nThe Democratic victory also proves that Republicans are far from invincible under Mr. Trump, a natural showman beloved by the GOP's grassroots but with more limited appeal in the cities and suburbs. Democrats recruited a historic number of women and people of color to run for House seats, and showed that these candidates could win even in traditionally red districts.\n\nTuesday night's House results are a much-needed boost for the Democrats, who have struggled in a string of midterm elections. Republicans won the House in 2010 and retook the Senate in 2014. Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss to Mr. Trump, coupled with the GOP's ability to retain control of Congress that year, also stunned the Democratic faithful.\n\nOn the Republican side, Paul Ryan's retirement is likely to set off a struggle for minority leader.

The GOP had 51 votes heading into Tuesday night.\n\nMr. Trump had been barnstorming through states with competitive Senate races in recent weeks, including Missouri, Texas, and Florida. In the Lone Star state, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz successfully fended off a tough challenge from Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke.\n\nThe election results are a victory for Mr. Trump, who will see his party retain control of one chamber of Congress. They are also a win for Kentucky Sen.

The approval of Amendment 4 ensures that felons who have completed their sentence will be able to vote, with the exception to those convicted of murder and sexual offenses, who will remain ineligible.\n\nWith its 29 electoral college votes and perennial swing-state status, Florida is tremendously influential politically.
