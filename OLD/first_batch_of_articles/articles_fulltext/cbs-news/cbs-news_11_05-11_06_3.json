["", "", "", "ST. LOUIS \u2014 Voters aren't just choosing between candidates this Election Day. There are 155 ballot measures being considered in 37 states on issues ranging from a carbon tax to expanding access to marijuana.\n\nIn Missouri, voters have to decide between Republican Josh Hawley and Democrat Claire McCaskill for Senate. But as CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds reports, they're also weighing whether medical marijuana should be legalized. There are three distinct measures, and the differences between the proposals include the ability for patients to grow their own medical cannabis and the tax rates for the product.\n\nMedical marijuana is on the ballot in Utah, while Michigan could approve recreational pot. In North Dakota, a ballot proposal would decriminalize the sale and possession of marijuana for people over 21. A yes by all four states means medical marijuana use would be legal in 33 states, and recreational use would be legal in 11.\n\nIn 2014, recreational marijuana first went on sale in Colorado, after voters there approved what was called the \"Great Experiment.\" Since then, recreational pot became legal in nine states plus the District of Columbia. The marijuana industry has also become a success, with legal cannabis projecting to reach more than $10 billion in sales this year.\n\nBut opponents of legalization have pointed to an increase of use among teenagers. In a letter to Colorado's governor last year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited a federal study showing marijuana use by young people in in the state increased 20 percent since legalization. But the study also tracked use through 2016, eventually showing a decline.\n\nOther ballot initiatives include a chance for voters in Florida to restore voting rights to most felons finished with their sentences. Roughly 1.5 million people could alter the 2020 election. It needs a 60 percent majority\n\nIdaho, Nebraska and Utah -- all deep red states -- will vote on whether to expand Medicaid for low-income Americans as provided by the Affordable Care Act.

Anne Arundel County Police arrived at the house at 5:17 a.m. to remove guns from the home under a new law that temporarily allows for the seizure of firearms if a person shows \"red flags\" that they are a danger to themselves or others, CBS Baltimore reports.\n\nA man, later identified by police as 61-year-old Gary Willis, answered his door with a gun in his hand, Anne Arundel County Police Sgt. Jacklyn Davis said.\n\nSgt. Davis said the man put the gun down. But then, according to a police press release, Willis \"became irate\" when officers attempted to serve the order. Willis picked the weapon up again, \"a fight ensued over the gun,\" and a shot was fired, Davis said. The first shot didn't strike anyone, but the officers then fatally shot the man, Sgt. Davis said.\n\nNeither of the officers were injured. Their names weren't released.\n\nIt wasn't clear why the \"red flag\" order was issued. A spokeswoman for the Maryland Judiciary denied a request from the Baltimore Sun to release protection order requests associated with the home, citing the law which states the orders are confidential unless a court rules otherwise.\n\nMichele Willis, the man's niece, told The Baltimore Sun that one of her aunts requested the protective order against Willis, but she declined to say why.\n\nShe said police stopped by the home to speak with her uncle Sunday night. He lived above the garage and several other family members also lived in the home. Those who were there during the shooting were being questioned by police Monday morning, The Sun reported.\n\nWillis said her uncle \"likes to speak his mind,\" but \"wouldn't hurt anybody.\"\n\n\"I'm just dumbfounded right now,\" she said. \"They didn't need to do what they did.\"\n\nMaryland is one of several states that passed \"red flag\" laws since the high school mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, earlier this year.

Nearly two-thirds of those voters said Mr. Trump was a factor. One quarter of those casting a House ballot said they did so in part to support him. Four in 10 said they cast a vote to oppose him. Only one-third said he played no role in their voting.\n\nOnly a minority of those voting today approve of Mr. Trump's job performance. The level appears similar to his ratings among the general public overall in recent months. It is also similar to the ratings for former President Obama in the 2010 midterm election, in which Republicans captured majority control from Democrats.\n\nVoters reported that their No. 1 issue in this election was health care \u2014 mentioned by just under half of those surveyed. Health care was mentioned by almost twice as many voters as the next most common issue, immigration.\n\nA majority (70 percent) of today's voters say that the health care system needs major changes. Over half say that the Democratic Party would be better able to protect people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nVoters are feeling better about the state of the economy than they have since before the Great Recession of 2008. More than two-thirds rate the economy as good, compared to 36 percent only two years ago.\n\nHowever, only 1 in 5 voters selected the economy as the most important issue in the election this year, perhaps limiting the benefit of this issue for the ruling Republican Party.\n\nAlmost half (48 percent) of voters feel that President Trump's immigration policy is too tough. This is overwhelmingly true among Democrats.\n\nThe majority of voters support stricter gun control and this is the case for over three-quarters of Democrats.\n\nAlmost half of voters (46 percent) say that Mr. Trump's approach to foreign policy is making the U.S. feel less safe.\n\nThe specific issues of trade and taxes do not seem to be helping the GOP's prospects. More voters said that they area where they live had been hurt by Mr. Trump's trade policy than had been helped. On taxes, the number of people who said they had benefited was nearly the as those who were hurt, and nearly half saw no impact.\n\nDespite positive feelings about the economy, overall, voters were pessimistic about the direction of the country. Only 4 in 10 said the country was headed in the right direction, while nearly 6 in 10 viewed the country as off on the wrong track.\n\nOver three-quarters of voters think Americans are becoming more politically divided.\n\nAge, race and gender\n\nThe so-called \"gender gap\" has been a staple of American elections for several decades. However, the party that benefits from this gap has not always been consistent.\n\nThis year, men split their House votes about evenly between Democratic and Republican candidates, 48 to 50 percent, while women sided heavily with Democrats, 60 to 39 percent.\n\nThis is a mirror image of the 2014 midterm election, which Republicans dominated. In 2014, women split almost evenly between the two parties while men favored Republicans by a 16-point margin.\n\nFour years ago, in the 2014 midterm elections, white voters favored Republican House candidates by 16 percentage points. In this year's midterm, that advantage narrowed to only 7 points.\n\nAmong whites with a college degree the shift is even more pronounced: Republicans went from a 16-point lead in 2014, to actually trailing Democrats by 10 points (55 to 44 percent) in this year's election.\n\nNationally, younger voters favored Democratic House candidates over Republican candidates. Voters age 18-29 supported Democrats by a 35-point margin.\n\nVoters age 30-44 favored Democrats by 19 points, and voters 45 to 64 by only 2 points. Those 65 or older voted Republican by a 1-point margin, the only age group to favor the GOP this year.\n\nAbout 16 percent of 2018 midterm voters are first-time voters, and of those, almost two-thirds are voting for the Democratic candidate. Almost half of these first-time midterm voters are under age 30.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV. Start a free trial.\n\n\n\nAbout the authors: David R.

It's time we walk our talk and provide the transformational change our constituents are calling for.\"\n\nThe top two positions are currently held by Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer. Rep. Jim Clyburn is the highest-ranking African-American Democrat, holding the position of Assistant Democratic Leader. The post was created for him after he unsuccessfully challenged Hoyer for the minority whip position.\n\nPelosi, the first female House speaker, has floated the idea of serving as a \"transitional\" speaker should Democrats return to power. Clyburn has said that he would not challenge Pelosi or Hoyer if either ran for the speaker position, but has also suggested that he could be a \"transitional\" leader.\n\nThe emphasis on transition is largely due to the fact that all three are nearing 80; Pelosi and Clyburn are 78, and Hoyer is 79. Several younger Democrats who were expected to take on the mantle of leadership have left the House, and either pursued a private sector career, such as former New York Rep.

Sales at comparable stores in North America, which excludes the effects of store openings and closings, dropped 9.8 percent from the year before, the company said Tuesday. It had a loss of $20 million on $364 million in sales for the quarter, before adjustments.\n\nIt's the third straight quarter of dropping sales for Papa John's. Less than a year ago, Schnatter gave up his CEO role after blaming the nationwide controversy over kneeling National Football League players for slowing sales growth at the company, which was an NFL sponsor and advertiser. He remains a major shareholder, however.\n\nAs CEO Steve Ritchie diplomatically put it during a conference call with analysts Tuesday: \"Our third-quarter results reflect the brand challenges we experienced this year.\"\n\nRitchie outlined a turnaround plan on the call, including a more robust marketing campaign aimed at boosting consumer trust in the brand.

Investigators said Watts in August killed his 34-year-old wife, Shanann, and daughters Bella, 4, and Celeste, 3, before dumping their bodies on property belonging to an oil company where he worked.\n\nThe girls' bodies were found in oil barrels and Shanann's body was found in a shallow grave nearby. Shanann Watts was 15 weeks pregnant with a baby boy she planned to name Nico.\n\nRJ Sangosti/Getty\n\nThe case gained national attention in part due to Christopher Watts' public pleas for his family's return before his arrest.\n\nWatts appeared in court Tuesday and pleaded guilty to all nine counts against him, including five counts of first-degree murder, one count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy, and three counts of tampering with a deceased human body. Watts wept as he entered the pleas, the Denver Channel reported.\n\nThe plea deal calls for Watts to be sentenced to three consecutive life sentences for the deaths of Shanann, Celeste and Bella, along with additional time for the unlawful termination of the couple's unborn child, Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke said at a press conference following the hearing. He said a judge has not formally accepted the guilty pleas or the sentence. Watts is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 19.\n\nRourke said he had detailed conversations with Shanann Watts' family after Christopher Watts' attorney approached him about a possible deal. He said the family was strongly against pursuing the death penalty, especially after they discussed the extensive delays in the process in Colorado. Rourke said their wishes were the most compelling factor for him in reaching the plea agreement.\n\nRourke said Shanann Watts' mother told him, \"'He made the choice to take those lives, I do not want to be in the position of making the choice to take his.'\"\n\n\"That about as firmly as she could have said it to me,\" Rourke said.\n\nRourke said he hoped the agreement would bring some measure of closure for the family, who were present during the court hearing and the press conference. But he said: \"I know that will never be fully realized, because the tragedy that sits before us today is the loss of four beautiful lives. And no matter what happens today, no matter what happens at a sentencing hearing down the road, we can't get them back.\"\n\nCBS Denver\n\nRourke said his office discussed whether to require Watts to provide a full and accurate account of what happened during the slayings, but said everyone involved agreed Watts would never offer a truthful statement. Watts has claimed Shanann had killed one daughter and was actively trying to kill the other when he attacked her in an act of passion, CBS Denver reported.\n\nRourke said \"the spotlight he tried to shine on Shanann, falsely, incorrectly and frankly, a flat-out lie, has been corrected\" by his guilty pleas. \"The spotlight shines directly where it belongs \u2014 on him,\" Rourke said.\n\nRourke said investigators believe they have a partial motive for the slayings, but said he wouldn't give details until after Watts is sentenced.", "", "U.S. stocks closed higher Tuesday as industrial and technology companies recovered some of the big losses they took in October.

That could help big-box stores and grocery chains, which get a lot of revenue from those programs.\n\nIf Republicans keep control of the House, Levine said, they might index capital gains taxes to inflation, which would effectively cut those taxes. While that could boost the economy, it would also encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates at a faster pace, and investors are already concerned that rates could rise too fast.", "NEW YORK -- Akayed Ullah, a Bangladeshi immigrant who set off a pipe bomb in New York City's busiest subway station at rush hour, was convicted Tuesday of terrorism charges. After the verdict was announced and the jury left the room, Ullah spoke out, telling the judge: \"I was angry with Donald Trump because he says he will bomb the Middle East and then he will protect his nation.\"\n\nJudge Richard Sullivan told him: \"Right now is not the time for a statement.\"\n\nThe verdict capped a weeklong trial that featured surveillance video of Ullah on the morning when his pipe bomb sputtered, seriously burning him in a subway corridor beneath Times Square and the Port Authority bus terminal on December 11, 2017. The defense maintained that he intended to kill only himself. Nobody died and most of the injuries were not serious.\n\nProsecutors disputed the defense claim, saying Ullah would not have worn a bomb had he wanted to kill only himself. They said he wanted to maim or kill commuters as part of a \"lone wolf\" terrorist attack on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\n\nThey also cited social media postings by Ullah as well as comments he made after his arrest to investigators. He taunted President Trump on Facebook before the attack.\n\nAuthorities said Ullah's radicalization began in 2014 when he started viewing materials online, including a video instructing ISIS supporters to carry out attacks in their homelands.\n\nIn closing arguments Monday, Assistant U.S. Attorney George Turner said Ullah told investigators after his arrest that he wanted to avenge U.S. aggression toward ISIS and had chosen a busy weekday morning to attack so he could terrorize as many people as possible.\n\nThe prosecutor said Ullah, 28, of Brooklyn, followed the propaganda of ISIS online and wanted to follow its instructions to carry out a \"lone wolf\" terror attack on Americans. \"His goal was to injure and kill innocent civilians, to terrorize,\" Turner said.\n\nThe prosecutor said Ullah told an investigator after his arrest: \"I did it for the Islamic State.\"\n\nGallicchio, though, said Ullah purposefully chose an isolated corridor to set off his bomb because he only wanted to commit suicide. \"This is not a terrorist attack,\" she argued.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley disputed the claim. \"It was about martyrdom, not suicide,\" she said.\n\nUllah was indicted on five counts in the attack, including providing material support to terrorists and using a weapon of mass destruction.

In 2017, the country dropped $691.9 billion on making merry, specifically by purchasing plenty of decorations, candy and, of course, gifts.\n\nWhile satisfying everyone's list used to mean trudging out to the mall and battling hordes of stressed-out, weary shoppers, more people than ever now depend on Amazon to help make holiday wishes come true. The CNBC All-American Economic Survey 2017 found that 76 percent of U.S. consumers did holiday shopping on Amazon. Walmart garnered 8 percent.\n\nOne trade-off of having thousands of products available for purchase at the tap of a button: These potential gifts exist only as a collection of pixels on your screen until they actually arrive at your front door, which is why most of us look to customer reviews for insights on whether the gift is worth pulling out the credit card for.\n\nBut many of the purported authentic reviews from ordinary, everyday shoppers are works of fiction, paid for by merchants to bolster the sales of whatever they're shilling. All this makes fake Amazon reviews a growing problem for customers and a headache for the e-commerce giant, whose company ethos is putting customers first.\n\nWho writes fake Amazon reviews?\n\n\"I got a free dress out of the process, they got a review,\" said Alex Tran. A yoga and fitness blogger, Tran found herself browsing private Facebook groups dedicated to hooking up sellers with review writers. She quickly received a private message from someone offering to reimburse her in full for purchasing a maxi dress and reviewing it on Amazon.\n\n\"They gave me a selection of six different dresses,\" Tran said. \"I thought, 'That's cool, you can get things you're actually interested in.'\" The individual didn't pressure her into writing a 5-star review, though they did encourage Tran to post a photo of the dress with her review \"so it looks more authentic.\"\n\nThe positive feedback Tran left on the dress' Amazon product description page appears to other users as a verified purchase -- a classification reserved for reviews written by those who buy the product but don't receive any sort of discount. Tran remains adamant that receiving the dress for free didn't bias her review, but that disclaimer is nowhere to be found on the review.\n\nThis under-the-table relationship between sellers and review writers for hire exists because it works. \"Historically, consumers have relied on price and brand to determine the quality of a product,\" said Bart de Lange, associate professor of marketing at Escuela Superior de Administraci\u00f3n y Direcci\u00f3n de Empresas (ESADE) in Barcelona, Spain, and author of a recent study on the validity of online ratings. \"What we found is, as soon as you give consumers access to the average user rating, it blows away the other effects.\"\n\nSeeing that 5-star rating on a child's car seat can override our better judgment, convincing us an $80 product is just as good as one costing $400.\n\nHow to identify fake Amazon reviews.\n\nThe star rating represents just one facet of customer feedback on a product you have access to when shopping on Amazon, the other being the written text reviews themselves. Reading glowing reviews about how a pair of headphones transformed a customer's appreciation of music or why a particular brand of toilet paper has them looking forward to every trip to the bathroom helps reinforce the belief that you're looking at a quality purchase and helps convert you from a casual online shopper to a customer -- a fact Amazon counts on.\n\n\"Reviews are accounted for in Amazon's search algorithm very similarly to how PageRank works on Google,\" said Saoud Khalifah, CEO of Fakespot, a website dedicated to helping consumers identify questionable online reviews. \"If you have a high rating and positive customer sentiment, they weigh your product very heavily,\" meaning the review gets seen by more potential Amazon shoppers like you.\n\nKhalifah founded Fakespot in 2016 to shine a light on what he sees as a rampant problem that threatens to undermine the credibility of customer reviews. \"It's a goal for me to bring trust back to e-commerce,\" he said.\n\nShoppers curious about the quality of reviews on a product can copy and paste the product page's link into a search bar on the Fakespot homepage and receive a grade on the overall reliability of the reviews, ranging from F to A. The Fakespot algorithm analyzes each review's language (comparing it linguistically with the language of known fake reviews), the review writer's history on Amazon, the number of total reviews the product has received in a short time span and other factors Khalifah wouldn't reveal to determine the grade of the product's reviews.\n\nIt should be noted that Fakespot never says a product has fake Amazon reviews. Instead it uses the term \"unreliable,\" since the company claims it's impossible to know for certain the intent of the reviewer and whether it was written in good faith.\n\nHere's a quick checklist for spotting bogus reviews:\n\nThe review sounds like it's describing another product. If a review about lip balm suddenly mentions how the dog loves it, you should be suspicious.\n\n\n\nIf a review about lip balm suddenly mentions how the dog loves it, you should be suspicious.

Under the act, would-be Puerto Rico residents, possibly like Paulson, are only subject to taxes levied by the island, like sales tax and license fees, said Matt Fabian, a partner at Massachusetts-based Municipal Market Analytics. Even property tax has a 90 percent exception under the law, Fabian said in a telephone interview Tuesday with CBS News.\n\nThe act, officially dubbed the Act to Promote the Relocation of Investors to Puerto Rico, is not available to current island residents.\n\n\"You're sort of above it all,\" Fabian said. \"It's a very lucrative tax package so as to attract 'richies' like Paulson.\"\n\nPaulson became a billionaire by shorting the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial collapse in 2007 and 2008. Since then, he's funneled an estimated $1.5 billion into Puerto Rican real estate investments, snapping up ritzy hotels on the island, like the Cordado Vanderbilt and St. Regis Bahia Beach Resort. At an investment summit in 2014, he referred to the island as the \"next Singapore.\"\n\nPuerto Rico is still struggling to get to its feet after Hurricanes Maria devastated the U.S. territory last year, claiming an estimated 2,975 lives.\n\nMeanwhile, the territory remains bankrupt, fighting with creditors -- many of which are sophisticated hedge fund investors -- on how to pay back $74 billion in debt. The island's former governor, Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla, famously called the debt \"unpayable\" in the summer of 2015, claiming that all revenue streams that could have paid back investors, including tax revenue, were tapped.", "Millions of Americans are heading to the polls Tuesday to cast their ballots in 435 House seats, 35 Senate races and 36 gubernatorial contests.

This is followed by immigration, abortion, Social Security and minimum wage, in that order.\n\nGoogle Trends\n\nGoogle Trends has an interactive graphic that shows the interest in these issues shifting over time.\n\nTwitter followers\n\nTwitter, of course, is President Trump's favorite social media platform, but candidates' Twitter followings are determined by several factors and may not always reflect their popularity among voters. How long they've had their Twitter account, for example, may affect how many followers they've accumulated over time.\n\nOut of the high-profile races in Georgia, Florida and Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz is the candidate with the most Twitter followers, coming in at 3.25 million. His opponent, Beto O'Rourke, has the second-highest number with about 756,000.\n\nIt's worth noting that some of those followers on both sides might not actually be supporters; some people use Twitter to keep tabs on the opposition, and many journalists follow tweets from candidates of both parties all over the country.\n\nTrending topics on Twitter can give insight into what people are talking about on Election Day. Nationwide, U.S. trending topics on November 6 didn't include any candidates' names, but rather different variations of election day hashtags. #IVoted, #MidtermElections208, #GoVote and #ElectionDay were all trending.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV.

Another group of teachers in the district dressed as Mexican stereotypes.\n\nSeveral parents took offense to the photos of the costumes, which were posted on the school district's Facebook page. The photos were removed and Superintendent Josh Middleton announced the district was investigating the teachers' \"insensitive and inappropriate\" costumes.

However, we believe its been blown out of proportion,\" the petition states. \"These men and women are a huge part of our children's lives and the love and support they give them should not be overshadowed by what happened.\"\n\nSome supporters wrote their reasons for signing the petition on the Chage.org page. \"I support our teachers 100% and know they did not do this as racial hatred! They are amazing individuals and I'm proud to have them teaching my children!\" one person wrote.\n\nA counter-petition supporting a \"no racism effort\" in the Middleton School District was created on MoveOn.org, with the goal of being delivered to the superintendent.

While everyone else enjoys their eggnog and the billionth viewing of \"A Christmas Story\" in the run-up to the big day, last-minute shoppers spam the \"refresh\" button on their browser to see if the packages filled with Yuletide joy will arrive by the 25th.\n\nNow retailers -- most recently e-commerce giant Amazon -- have started offering free shipping policies to help procrastinators get their gifts on-time without emptying their bank accounts or overcharging their credit cards.\n\nAmazon's holiday shipping deal\n\nOutside of the holiday season, Amazon offers free shipping on orders of $25 or more, or to anyone with an Amazon Prime account (which costs $119 a year, or $12.99 a month). The retailer has given a gift of its own to all Amazon customers by waiving that $25 minimum for free shipping on hundreds of millions of products across all of its store's categories.\n\nHowever, those who really drag their heels when it comes to holiday shopping should know that this free shipping only applies to the standard delivery speed of five to eight days.\n\nPrime members, who already enjoy free two-day shipping, have free same-day delivery to look forward to during this holiday promotion, which runs from Nov. 5 until when Amazon can no longer guarantee packages sent via standard shipping will arrive in time for Christmas (likely five to eight days before the 25th).\n\nWho else is giving the gift of free shipping?\n\nAmazon's decision to expand its free shipping policy comes at a time of year when other major e-commerce retailers are deploying similar tactics in a bid to attract holiday shoppers.

Additionally, Michigan voters will consider a measure to curtail partisan gerrymandering by creating a commission responsible for drawing district boundaries for the state legislature and for the state's congressional delegation.\n\nNew York: New York City voters will decide the fate of three important ballot initiatives to reform local elections. One measure would drastically decrease the maximum amount of campaign donations a city candidate is allowed to receive. Another proposal would create a Civic Engagement Commission run by the Mayor's office to try to boost public participation in local elections and governance. The third ballot initiative would impose term limits on members of community boards \u2014 a staple of local New York City politics.\n\nFlorida: Florida is the third-largest state in the country by population, and has the highest number of people disenfranchised by prior felony convictions. Amendment 4 would change that, giving all felons the right to vote, with the exception of those convicted of sex crimes or murder. The amendment is through to enjoy broad bipartisan support.\n\nMarijuana\n\nMichigan: Voters in the Great Lakes State will decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana for residents over the age of 21 and subject retail sales of the product to a 10 percent tax.\n\nMissouri: Missouri voters will be asked to choose between three distinct measures to legalize medical marijuana use. The differences between the proposals include the ability for patients to grow their own medical cannabis and the tax rates for the product.\n\nNorth Dakota: A ballot proposal in this conservative state would decriminalize the sale and possession of marijuana for any person over the age of 21 and expunge the criminal records of individuals convicted of possessing the controlled substance.\n\nUtah: A proposition in the Beehive State would authorize the use of medical cannabis among qualifying patients.\n\nGambling\n\nFlorida: Floridians will decide whether voters \u2014 not the legislature \u2014 will have the right to expand gambling in the Sunshine State. If approved, Amendment 3 \u2014 pushed by Voters in Charge, a political committee backed by Disney and the Seminole Tribe \u2014 would give voters the exclusive right to authorize gambling.\n\nDaylight saving time\n\nCalifornia: If Proposition 7 is approved, the California legislature would have the authority to enact year-round daylight saving time. Proponents argue that the biannual ritual \u2014 springing forward and falling back \u2014 is bad for the health of California citizens. Opponents say morning routines would take place exclusively in the dark.", "Los Angeles attorney Linda Smith is the author of the book \"Smashing Glass & Kicking Ass,\" a manual for female empowerment based on her own personal experience. Smith, 65, retired from the corporate law firm of O'Melveny & Myers after a 40-year career that included a landmark case in which her client won a $1.2 billion settlement.\n\nIn an interview with CBS MoneyWatch, she discusses how women can outmaneuver men to reach the executive suite.\n\nMoneyWatch: You describe yourself as the \"meanest woman alive\" on your website. Is this to help you in your career, or to sell your book?\n\nSmith: That title was actually given to me in 2001 by Corporate Board Member magazine when I was a full-time corporate attorney. My clients, executives at companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers and Humana, called me that.\n\nMW: But you've adopted it as your trademark?\n\nSmith: Yes, but I don't consider myself \"mean.\" As a gladiator for my clients -- mostly men by the way -- I was ferocious and fierce in their defense and can bring out the stiletto when needed. The opposition knew they would have to scratch and claw just to stay alive. I represented Exxon in the Valdez oil spill case.\n\nEven though I'm no longer in full-time practice, I do assist in cases involving illegal immigrants and voting rights. I'm a Democrat and a liberal.\n\nMW: Now you want to teach women how to be \"gladiators\" for themselves, but do they need this advice?\n\nSmith: As a top attorney in my firm who mentored a lot of women, I saw that females weren't making it. They graduated from law schools in equal numbers, but got tired and discouraged. The same thing holds true in other professions like venture capital. In fact, there are less female CEOs now than there were last year.\n\nMW: Why aren't more women at the top in Corporate America?\n\nSmith: Studies have shown -- by 11 out of 12 different measures -- that women score better than men on leadership skills such as taking initiative, integrity, motivating others and building relationships. But women have been playing by the \"male\" playbook. They defer to men. They engage in self-sabotaging behavior such as starting conversations with, \"I might be wrong but \u2026\" Women apologize a lot. They want to be liked.\n\nMW: How should they correct this?\n\nSmith: Women need to use their superior emotional intelligence established in many studies. That's our \"feminine superpower.\" Women can read the people in the room, assess the situation strategically, come up with a nuanced course of action and then take control. Alpha males get caught up in the testosterone game. While they're busy playing who has the biggest Alpha, women should read the situation and operate under the radar.\n\nMW: Can you cite a real-life example?\n\nSmith: Sure. During the second presidential debate, Trump came up and stood behind Hillary. Instead of just taking it, she should have told him, \"Get back on your own side!\" She was afraid of seeming weak and not made of steel.\n\nWomen have to rise up and take control from this type of classic misogynist. Tell the guy to go back into his corner and stop stalking you. If he keeps interrupting you, look him straight in the eye, use confident body language and then tell the guy to \"shut up!\"\n\nMW: Would the corporate world actually accept this?\n\nSmith: These studies that I've cited show that companies with more women in the boardroom make more money.\n\nMW: Any final advice for women in the corporate world?\n\nSmith: Stop trying to be liked. Likeability is overrated. Don't act like a deferential woman. Work on being respected. Be confident. Confidence trumps competence every time.", "Amazon is taking a page from the Home Shopping Network and its owner, QVC as retailers turn the entire month of November into an non-stop barrage of Black Fridays.

In early 2017, Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled the GOP-crafted congressional map violated the state's constitutional guarantee of \"free and equal elections.\" A new chart nixed gerrymandered districts, including one notorious for its nonsensical \"Goofy-kicking-Donald-Duck\" shape. That left Fitzgerald in a sea of newcomers when Republican colleagues Charlie Dent and Ryan Costello opted to retire instead of jumping into bluer districts. While Trump still won 10 of the 18 new districts, the new map created at least two brand new blue districts, a key to Democratic hopes of taking back the House.\n\nAnd Fitzpatrick has been running as a member of a party increasingly defined by its headline-snagging commander in chief.\n\n\"We're a microcosm of the entire United States of America,\" Fitzgerald says. \"This is why a lot of people in the press come here every two years.\"\n\nFitzgerald is a former FBI agent who votes with President Trump 84 percent of the time.

Officials said that while both men's deaths are being investigated as suicides, there is no indication that their deaths are related.\n\nCorrections officials said they found Andrew Urdiales, 54, unresponsive during a security check at San Quentin State Prison late Friday. He was sentenced to death on Oct. 5 by an Orange County judge for killing five women in California, and previously faced the death penalty for three murders in Illinois.\n\nThe California victims were Robbin Brandley, 23, in January 1986 in Mission Viejo; Maryann Wells, 31, in September 1988 in San Diego; Julie McGhee, 29, in July 1988 in Cathedral City; Tammie Erwin, 20, in April 1989 in Palm Springs; and Denise Maney, 32, in March 1995 in Palm Springs. The murders occurred while he was stationed at various U.S. Marine Corps facilities in Southern California.\n\nA woman who survived a 1992 attack by Urdiales, Jennifer Asbenson, described her harrowing getaway to \"48 Hours\" in the 2011 episode, \"Escape from a Serial Killer.\"\n\nHe previously was convicted of killing Cassie Corum, 21, and Lori Uylaki, 25, both from Hammond, Illinois; and Lynn Huber, 22, of Chicago, in the mid-1990s. Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan commuted his sentence to life in prison in 2002 for two murders, and his third sentence was also commuted when Illinois banned the death penalty.\n\nHe was then extradited to California to face charges there, and he had been on California's death row since Oct. 12.\n\nSeparately, authorities say they found Virendra Govin, 51, unresponsive alone in his cell in a different death row housing unit late Sunday. Both inmates were being held in single cells at the time of their deaths, according to a prison statement released to CBS San Francisco. An autopsy will determine their causes of death.\n\nGovin was sentenced in December 2004 for committing four Los Angeles County murders.\n\nThe victims were Gita Kumar, 42; Plara Kumar, 18: Tulsi Kumar, 16; and Sitaben Patel, 63. Govin, his brother Pravin Govin, and Carlos Amador, then set the Kumars' home on fire in 2002. Govin arrived on death row in January 2005. His brother, Pravin, has been on death row since September 2005.\n\nAll male prisoners in California on condemned status are housed at San Quentin in maximum-security custody level units, reports CBS San Francisco. But California has not executed anyone since 2006 and inmates are far more likely to die from suicide or old age.\n\nSince California reinstated capital punishment in 1978, 79 condemned inmates have died from natural causes, 25 have committed suicide, 13 have been executed in California, one was executed in Missouri, and one was executed in Virginia.\n\nThere currently are 740 offenders on California's death row.\n\nWhile suicides are not uncommon, the pair of deaths comes weeks after a rare slaying.\n\nOfficials said Jonathan Fajardo, 30, was fatally stabbed Oct. 5 in a recreational yard. Fellow inmate Luis Rodriguez, 34, is considered the suspect, but investigators were trying to determine a motive and how he obtained or was able to make the weapon.\n\nThe suspected suicides were announced the same day that a federal court-appointed special master who oversees prison mental health care criticized California corrections officials for proposing that they be allowed to start negotiating an end to federal oversight of suicide prevention efforts.\n\nSpecial master Matty Lopes called the state's proposal \"incredibly premature\" given the continued problems outlined in an expert's report also released Monday.\n\nAttorneys representing inmates said the state's suicide rate is, for the second year in a row, on track to exceed 24 suicides per 100,000 inmates. That was before six suicides since Sept. 1, including the two on death row.\n\nThat far exceeds the national state prison rate of 16 suicides per 100,000 inmates.\n\nThe exchange came as a federal judge considers appointing an outside investigator to weigh a whistleblower's allegations that top California corrections officials are misleading federal officials about improvements in the treatment of mentally ill inmates.\n\nState officials again denied that there was any fraudulent activity but said some mistakes have since been corrected.", "", "The award-winning HBO series \"Big Little Lies\" captivated fans with its strong portrayal of female friendships. It was adapted from a book of the same name written by New York Times best-selling author Liane Moriarty, who has just released a new novel.\n\n\"Nine Perfect Strangers\" follows people trying to transform their lives at a wellness retreat run by an eccentric leader. Nicole Kidman, who also starred in \"Big Little Lies,\" is set to star in and executive produce the adaptation of Moriarty's latest page-turner.\n\n\"The reason I chose to set it at a wellness retreat actually all started with a joke. After 'Big Little Lies' came out, I kept making the same joke. And the joke was: 'I'm going to set my next book at a tropical island resort, and I'm going to have do a lot of research,'\" Moriarty told \"CBS This Morning\" on Tuesday. \"But then I started thinking, actually, why not? A tropical island resort could make a perfect setting for a book.\"\n\nSo she did. But Moriarty said what really drew her to that setting was what people are seeking when they're looking for \"wellness.\" It often goes far beyond that.\n\n\"It's transformation, really. I think it's that desire to be somebody else. So when I was doing research for this book, I did just a little five-day retreat and I remember on the drive there, honestly, thinking to myself, maybe I'll be transformed by the end of this five days.

The Detroit News used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain a copy of the letter received by the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs on Oct. 12, which detailed concerns about the Cantrell Funeral Home.\n\nDetroit police raided the home that same day and found the hidden remains of 10 fetuses and an infant. The letter alleged that a former funeral home employee had hidden the corpses and was searching for a way to retrieve them from the now shuttered facility.\n\n\"If you look above the door there's a crawl space and she has several infant corpse(s) placed back there dating back from over 10 years ago,\" the letter said.\n\nThe anonymous writer also alleged the employee forged hundreds of documents, including death certificates. Police have opened a criminal investigation into Cantrell.\n\nState investigators suspended Cantrell's mortuary license in April after an inspection found deplorable conditions, such as bodies covered in what appeared to be mold. Another inspection in August uncovered \"a stillborn corpse in a box atop a table,\" investigators said.\n\nThe Cantrell facility is among several funeral homes in Michigan facing misconduct allegations. A separate police investigation is looking into the Perry Funeral Home in Detroit, where more than 60 fetuses where found in boxes and freezers in September.\n\nCarlos Osorio / AP\n\nA judge granted class-action status Monday to a lawsuit filed against the Perry Funeral Home.

Reports of additional illnesses are expected due to time lags between when an illness occurs and when the CDC receives confirmed lab results.\n\nThe illnesses occurred in three states: Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin, the CDC reported Wednesday.\n\n\"The FDA is investigating the manufacturing facility that made recalled Duncan Hines cake mixes,\" an announcement posted late Monday by the agency stated. \"FDA and the CDC informed Conagra Brands that a sample of Duncan Hines Classic White Cake Mix that contained Salmonella Agbeni matched the Salmonella collected from ill persons reported to the CDC. This was determined through Whole Genome Sequencing, a type of DNA analysis.\"\n\nThe recall involves approximately 2.4 million boxes of the cake mixes, a Conagra spokesperson emailed CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nThe CDC is interviewing people sickened by the salmonella bacteria to determine if they'd eaten Duncan Hines cake mixes before getting sick. \"Several of the individuals reported consuming a cake mix at some point prior to becoming ill, and some may have also consumed these products raw and not baked,\" the recall notice stated.\n\nConagra Brands\n\nConsumers were cautioned not to bake with or consume the recalled mixes, distributed to retailers nationwide and to some international export markets. The recalled mixes include: 15.25-ounce Duncan Hines Classic White Cake, 15.25-ounce Duncan Hines Classic Yellow Cake, 15.25-ounce Duncan Hines Classic Butter Golden Cake and 15.25-ounce Duncan Hines Classic Butter Golden Cake.

I mean, he thinks most things are a referendum on him.

Roosevelt, who said, \"A nation does not have to be cruel to be tough.\"\n\n\"I think that's something that may be pivotal in how people vote,\" Schieffer said.\n\nCBS News\n\nKearns Goodwin, whose most recent book is called \"Leadership: In Turbulent Times,\" (published by Simon and Schuster, a division of CBS), said she is encouraged by the number of women running for office for the first time.\n\n\"Just at a time when politics seems like a dishonorable profession, only 11 percent of the people support the Congress, these people want to the come in into it, which is so exciting. And they're bringing something different, I think, from the Year of the Woman before, which may not have worked before,\" Kearns Goodwin said. \"You've got an infrastructure and you've got a feeling that somehow they're outsiders coming in to change the system. Our system needs a revolution.\"\n\nWhile Kearns Goodwin cited research that showed \"women tend to cooperate more,\" she also pointed to their broader, collective experiences.\n\n\"I think most importantly, they're coming from being doctors, they're coming from being lawyers, they're coming from being veterans, they're coming from being teachers and pilots,\" she said. \"So you bring a fresh group of idealistic people who still believe in government. We haven't even believed in government in a long time, right? If they're coming in and believing in it and they can create a contagion among other people, wow! This is where my hope goes.\"\n\nSchieffer reminded viewers this election is \"all going to be about turnout.\"\n\n\"Does Trump get out those people that elected him president? Will that be enough to give these Republicans a boost, or will that have a counter-reaction? You know, I think he's going to energize Republicans. But I think hearing these things day after day, I think he's also going to energize Democrats,\" he said.\n\nKearns Goodwin said midterm turnout usually is motivated by discontent.\n\n\"My favorite one is in 1942, despite the economy coming back, it's the war, full employment, but coffee was rationed three days before the election. Only one cup a day. That was it,\" she said. \"So that may mean \u2013 why it is that Trump is talking about discontent? Creating discontent with a caravan to bring his people to the polls.

President Donald Trump has made the migrant caravan a central issue in Tuesday's vote.\n\nAuthorities counted more than 2,000 migrants at the Jesus Martinez stadium late Monday, and a steady flow continued into the night. The facility has capacity to hold 6,000, officials said, and four big tents set up for sleeping filled up. Women and children slept apart from the men, who were relegated to concrete bleachers, while the city's central market supplied 3.5 tons of bananas and guavas to refuel the crowd.\n\nStill hundreds of miles from the U.S. border, the migrants dozed on thin mattresses with blankets to ward off the chill in a city some 7,300 feet above sea level -- a big change after trudging for three weeks in tropical heat. Temperatures dropped below 52 degrees Fahrenheit during the night.\n\nNashieli Ramirez, ombudsman for the local human rights commission, said the city was preparing to accommodate as many as 5,000 people. The lead caravan is estimated to have about 4,000 participants and several smaller groups are trailing hundreds of miles to the south.\n\nMany of the migrants sought treatment for blistered and aching feet, respiratory infections, diarrhea and other maladies. City officials administered vaccines for tetanus and influenza. The Oxfam charity offered to donate 20 portable toilets.\n\nAlfredo Estrella/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTania Escobar, a nurse with Mexico City's public health department, said from a medical tent that demand was high for consultations. \"Since we got here, we have not stopped,\" she said.\n\nMelvin Figueroa, a 32-year-old from Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was with his pregnant wife and two children, 6 and 8. He took the 6-year-old girl to the tent because her eyes were irritated and \"she throws up everything she eats.\"\n\nMore migrants were trudging along the highway between the city of Puebla and the capital, trying to hitch rides from passing vehicles.\n\nMr. Trump has seized on the caravan and portrayed it as a major threat, though such caravans have sprung up regularly over the years and largely passed unnoticed. He ordered thousands of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border. The Pentagon said Monday more than 5,100 U.S. troops are now stationed across the border with Mexico. Their mission is to keep caravans of Central Americans out.\n\nCBS News' Mireya Villarreal saw a steady stream of military vehicles in one south Texas border town. Where a week ago there was an empty field, there's now at least 300 troops. The soldiers are there as backup for Customs and Border Patrol agents.\n\nMr. Trump has threatened to detain asylum seekers in tents cities and insinuated without proof that there are criminals or even terrorists in the group.\n\nIn dozens of interviews since the initial caravan set out from Honduras more than three weeks ago, migrants have said they are escaping poverty and rampant violence. Many are families traveling with small children. Some say they left because they were threatened by gang members or had lost relatives to gang violence. Others say they hope to work, secure a good education for their children and send money to support relatives back home.\n\nAlba Zoleida Gonzalez, 48, from Valle, Honduras, said she walked for five hours Monday before catching a ride on a tractor-trailer with about 150 other migrants. Her calf muscles were aching, but that was a small price to pay for the chance at a life better than the one back home.\n\n\"I looked for work, and nothing,\" Gonzalez said, adding that her husband had been robbed and had to hand over everything he made selling crabs so his assailants wouldn't do worse. \"And when one does find a little job, they kill you for the money,\" she said.", "The CBS News battleground tracker poll finds an overwhelming majority of Americans are optimistic about the economy with 76 percent of voters rating it as \"very\" or \"somewhat\" good. But who gets to take credit for that?\n\nAs Americans headed to the polls Tuesday, CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told \"CBS This Morning\" it's important to remember \"economic cycles are long.\" She also warned that the \"sugar high\" the U.S. economy is experiencing this year may not last into 2019.\n\n\"This current upturn started back in June of 2009\u2026and from 2009 'til about 2017, through those years, we've seen growth at about, let's say 2.25 sometimes it popped up to 2.5 percent \u2013 tepid growth,\" Schlesinger said.\n\nThis year, the economy is on track for 3 percent growth, which would be the best growth since 2005. But that growth, Schlesinger said, comes at a cost with the 2018 deficit up 17 percent from 2017.\n\n\"We saw a lot of spending by the government, the deficit has widened, and frankly, that could actually be a problem next year because if the deficit is up pretty high and we are having problems with tariffs, we could see growth cool next year. So economists are telling me 3 percent growth would be great this year. That sugar high may not last into 2019,\" Schlesinger said.\n\nAhead of the midterms, Democrats argued that the 2017 tax law that cut taxes for corporations and wealthy Americans and provided smaller tax cuts for middle and low-income people and families props up the seemingly robust economy. President Trump also promised an additional tax cut for middle-class Americans in the lead up to Election Day but has yet to offer many details on that.\n\nStill, job growth has continued to hold steady with an average of 211,000 jobs added each month in 2018. U.S. businesses added a whopping 250,000 jobs in October, a number that surpassed Wall Street expectations.\n\n\"I think this far into a recovery the job situation is really terrific, right.

And also good news on wages which have just started to accelerate, up by just over 3 percent from a year ago.\"", "", "", "Talk about the dogs of the Dow. A new exchange-traded fund that invests in pet-related companies -- everything from pet food to veterinary services -- is taking aim at Americans' growing obsession with their furry friends.\n\nThe ProShares Pet Care ETF began trading on Tuesday under the ticker symbol PAWZ, aiming to lure investors who want to bet on the growing sector. It's the second such animal-spirited fund offering to launch this year.\n\nThe pet industry is booming in the U.S., expanding at twice the rate of GDP since the Great Recession, according to ProShares Managing Director Steve Cohen. Americans spent about $70 billion on their pets last year, according to the American Pet Products Association, an industry trade group.\n\nThat's no surprise given that Americans are now more likely to have pets than children, thanks to the aging baby boomer demographic and millennials delaying having children. Those trends are at the heart of the Pet Care ETF, Cohen said.\n\nSeven out of 10 households own pets, up from 56 percent in the 1980s, he noted. \"The baby boomers, the largest generation, have become empty nesters and are filling their houses with their new children, which are pets,\" he said. \"Then there are millennials, who are putting off having children.\"\n\nAn investing idea with more bark than bite?\n\nAmericans not only have more pets, but they're pampering them more than ever, noted Cohen, who has two dogs and said he was up all night with one of them after the pup ate a soap bar. \"Ninety-five percent of pet owners consider pets as part of their family,\" he noted. \"They focus on what they eat, whether that's eating healthier ingredients, like organic or grain-free foods, and we're doing the same thing for our pets.\"\n\nThe fund invests in 24 stocks tracked in the FactSet Pet Care Index, which includes large companies such as Nestle -- maker of pet foods such as Purina -- and smaller businesses such as Pets at Home, a U.K. pet supplies retailer.\n\nWhether the fund has more bark than bite remains to be seen. It's certainly not the first pet-related fund to begin trading this year. The Gabelli Pet Parent Fund NextShares debuted in June under the ticker PETZC. It has attracted $1.2 million in assets, considered a small amount for a fund.", "", "", "HOUSTON -- A jury has convicted the husband of a former sheriff's deputy for the strangulation death of a man the couple had confronted outside a Houston-area Denny's restaurant. Jurors on Monday found Terry Thompson guilty of murder.\n\nThe conviction comes after a judge declared a mistrial in June at Thompson's first trial. Jurors deliberated more than 26 hours over three days, but couldn't reach a verdict.\n\nThe incident began after Thompson confronted Hernandez about urinating in the parking lot of the Denny's in Sheldon in May 2017. Prosecutors argued Thompson wanted to kill 24-year-old John Hernandez and kept him in a chokehold after he stopped resisting.\n\nKHOU\n\nThompson's attorneys countered that he was only defending himself after being punched. They insisted Thompson kept Hernandez subdued only until he stopped resisting.\n\nA waitress who witnessed the altercation told CBS affiliate KHOU at the time that she and her manager begged Thompson to stop choking the victim after he turned purple.\n\nCellphone video recorded by a bystander shows a man who appears to be Terry Thompson lying on top of Hernandez.\n\nThe medical examiner ruled Hernandez, 24, died from strangulation and chest compression.\n\nThompson's wife, Chauna Thompson, helped restrain Hernandez and is also charged with murder. She was later fired by the Harris County Sheriff's Office. Her trial is set for April.\n\nTerry Thompson's trial moved to its punishment phase on Tuesday, after which jurors are expected to deliberate a sentence. The first of what's expected to be several days of testimony began Tuesday.\n\nThompson faces up to life in prison.", "PITTSBURGH -- Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto got a phone call from President Trump on the day a deadly synagogue shooting unfolded in the city. According to the mayor, the overall tone of the call was one of support, and it took an interesting turn.\n\nPeduto said he received the call on his cellphone as he stood outside the Tree of Life synagogue, the site of the attack that killed 11 people, CBS Pittsburgh/KDKA reports.\n\n\"It was cordial. He offered his assistance in any way possible,\" Peduto said. \"I gave him the update in the increase in fatalities and the number of wounded. He was not aware of that and was sort of taken a back.\"\n\nThe mayor said that as the gravity of the situation set in on the phone call, the conversation took a turn he wasn't expecting. Mr. Trump said we need to increase the death penalty, according to Peduto.\n\nPeduto said he didn't respond.\n\n\"Well, I was at that point, dealing with 11 fatalities that were down the street. Just trying to grapple with how we were going to set up the critical care centers, the coordination with the FBI to get info to the families and the condition of the police officers. It wasn't the first thing on my mind,\" he said.\n\n\"There's a level of emotion that almost makes you numb at that point, and hearing details that were coming from inside was really at the forefront of my mind,\" he said.\n\nPeduto said the conversation ended cordially and that they agreed to try and work together to assist the FBI.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump spoke with Peduto, he also spoke to reporters about the death penalty. He said \"we should stiffen up our laws in terms of the death penalty.\"\n\n\"When people do this they should get the death penalty,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And they shouldn't have to wait years and years. ... And, I think they should very much bring the death penalty into vogue.\"\n\nMayor Peduto said that when he heard Mr. Trump wanted to visit Pittsburgh after the shooting, he asked the White House to wait until after the funerals.\n\n\"I can't tell a president not to come, but I can try to coordinate what becomes our priorities, which are the families and the officers,\" he said.\n\nPeduto said his decision not to meet with Mr. Trump while the president was in Pittsburgh was not political. His priorities that day were elsewhere.\n\n\"Three days afterwards, we had only done ... two funerals out of 11. The priority was with them, and if I had to make that decision 100 times again, I'd make the same decision to be with those families and our officers,\" he said.", "The nation's leading pediatricians' group has strengthened its advice against spanking and other physical punishment because of the potential for long-term harm.\n\nIn an updated policy released Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics says that can include aggression, brain changes, substance abuse and suicidal behavior in adulthood.\n\nThe academy says research since its 1998 discipline policy led to the update. It says spanking is falling out of favor among parents, especially those with young children. While some parents still believe it can lead to short-term improvements in behavior, studies show spanking is no more effective than non-physical punishment, including timeouts, setting firm limits and establishing unwanted consequences.\n\n\"The good news is, fewer parents support the use of spanking than they did in the past,\" Robert D. Sege, MD, PhD, and a past member of AAP Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, an author of the policy statement, said in a statement. \"Yet corporal punishment remains legal in many states, despite evidence that it harms kids \u2013 not only physically and mentally, but in how they perform at school and how they interact with other children.\"\n\nThe group also suggests putting favorite toys away or reducing screen time.\n\n\"Although many children who were spanked become happy, healthy adults, current evidence suggests that spanking is not necessary and may result in long-term harm\" the academy advises.\n\nStudies published in the past two decades have bolstered evidence that spanking can make young kids more aggressive and defiant.\n\nOther studies have linked physical punishment in childhood with later brain changes in young adults including reduced gray matter and elevated levels of stress hormones. Suicidal behavior, substance abuse and anger are among other potential long-term consequences of spanking, studies have suggested.\n\nThe academy also warns against harsh verbal abuse including shaming kids, citing research linking it with depression and behavior problems in teens.\n\nAAP's policy statement provides resources for both physicians and parents to learn healthy forms of discipline, including limit setting, redirecting, and setting expectations.\n\n\"There's no benefit to spanking,\" Sege said. \"We know that children grow and develop better with positive role modeling and by setting healthy limits. We can do better.\"", "An 82-year-old great-grandmother from Texas voted for the first time ever during this year's midterm elections. Gracie Phillips was battling pneumonia and in hospice care when she voted early Thursday. Sadly, just four days after casting her midterm ballot, Phillips died \u2014 but not before she had her voice heard and her opinion counted, her granddaughters told CBS News.\n\nPhillips registered to vote in Grand Prairie, Texas, last month, just before she was admitted to the hospital. \"With such a large family started at such a young age, priorities in 1951 weren't the same out here in the country,\" her granddaughter, Michelle Phillips, told CBS News. \"Women were allowed to vote, but she was raising seven children and trying to work... [voting] kept getting pushed aside and she decided this year, 'I'm registering.'\"\n\nThe Phillips Family\n\nPhillips had seven children, 20 grandchildren, 33 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild, her granddaughter, Leslie Moore, told CBS News. She experienced a lot in her life but determined she should finally experience voting, too.\n\n\"It became so important to her and it was something she talked about,\" Michelle Phillips said. \"I think it really helped for her to have that goal, hoping she could get better so we could get her home from the ICU [before Election Day].\"\n\nThe great-grandmother was still in the hospital when early voting started, and her daughter struggled to decide if she should take her out to the polls. \"She finally decided it's so important to granny, so they took her last Thursday,\" Phillips said.\n\nThe poll workers were extremely kind to Phillips, her granddaughters said. She had a portable oxygen tank with her, so they brought the ballot to the parking lot so she wouldn't have to leave her car. Poll workers even blocked the windshield so no one could see who she was voting for as she filled out the ballot in the car.\n\nThe Phillips Family\n\nPhillips felt accomplished after casting her ballot. \"It was something that was always weighing on her and something that she always wanted to do,\" her granddaughter said.\n\n\"She was very proud, and she kept saying, 'I voted. Did you vote? Who did you vote for?'\" Moore said. Phillips encouraged her whole family to go out and vote.\n\nThe granddaughters described Gracie Phillips as \"always happy\" and an avid sports fan. She loved the Rangers and Cowboys and \"her day would be affected when Romo couldn't throw a pass.\" She will be missed by her family and friends very much, Moore and Phillips said.\n\n\"For her, it didn't matter what political affiliation that you held, as long as you voiced your opinion and were heard. And her opinion is now on the record forever,\" Phillips said. \"I think it's important that everybody in this political climate, that we learn to listen, because she always did.\"\n\n\"And respect opinions and don't judge others,\" Moore chimed in.\n\n\"Because nothing's going to change unless we start communicating and actually listen to each other,\" Phillips said.", "", "", "Women who love the early hours of the day are less likely to develop breast cancer, a new study suggests. British researchers analyzed two data banks that included more than 409,000 women to investigate the link between sleep traits and breast cancer risk.\n\nCompared to night owls, women who are early risers had a 40 percent lower risk of breast cancer, the study found.\n\nThe data also showed that women who slept longer than the recommended seven to eight hours a night had a 20 percent increased risk of breast cancer for each additional hour slept.\n\n\"We would like to do further work to investigate the mechanisms underpinning these results, as the estimates obtained are based on questions related to morning or evening preference, rather than actually whether people get up earlier or later in the day,\" said Rebecca Richmond. She is a research fellow in the Cancer Research U.K. Integrative Cancer Epidemiology Program at the University of Bristol.\n\n\"In other words, it may not be the case that changing your habits changes your risk of breast cancer; it may be more complex than that,\" she said.\n\n\"However, the findings of a protective effect of morning preference on breast cancer risk in our study are consistent with previous research\u2026,\" Richmond noted.\n\n\"We also found some evidence for a causal effect of increased sleep duration and sleep fragmentation on breast cancer,\" she added.\n\nThe study was presented Tuesday at the U.K.'s National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) annual cancer conference, in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nThe study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between sleeping patterns and breast cancer risk.\n\n\"These are interesting findings that provide further evidence of how our body clock and our natural sleep preference is implicated in the onset of breast cancer,\" said Cliona Clare Kirwan, a member of the NCRI Breast Clinical Studies Group. She was not involved in this research.\n\n\"We know already that night shift work is associated with worse mental and physical health. This study provides further evidence to suggest disrupted sleep patterns may have a role in cancer development,\" Kirwan said in a meeting news release.\n\nResearch presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.", "The government agency that oversees border patrol has postponed an Election Day \"crowd control exercise\" today in El Paso, Texas, near a Hispanic neighborhood with about 100 residents. The exercise was to have taken place in the hometown of Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic Senate candidate who's running a tight race against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection agency had scheduled the exercises at 10 a.m. Mountain Time. Shortly before they were about to start, officers on the scene said they were postponed.\n\nThe exercise, in El Paso's oldest neighborhood, was being called a \"mobile field force demonstration.\" Media were invited to attend the event.\n\nThe neighborhood is near an area where officials recently began constructing part of President Trump's border wall. A week ago, the agency blocked the El Paso del Norte International Bridge in downtown El Paso to train for the arrival of the migrant caravan from Central America. A CBP spokesman said today's activities are \"operational readiness exercises\" related to preparing for the caravan, which is still hundreds of miles south of the border.\n\n\"We will be reinforcing staffing, well in advance, to ensure that we can address any contingency,\" the spokesman said. \"Please know this: we will ensure border security.\"\n\nTyler Houlton, Department of Homeland Security press secretary, said it was \"flat-out wrong\" to suggest the planned exercises had any connection to today's voting. \"DHS has worked tirelessly to ensure the security of our election systems and will always secure our borders regardless of what day it might be,\" he said.\n\nBut Terri Burke, the executive director of the ACLU of Texas, denounced the plan as an \"election-day stunt,\" calling the timing and location \"suspicious.\"\n\n\"The Trump administration has \"done quite enough to intimidate voters without staging military rehearsals on the day our nation exercises our most important democratic obligation,\" Burke said.\n\nO'Rourke, asked about the exercise at a campaign stop last night, said that \"no walls, no exercises\" will \"keep us from honoring our laws, our commitments. Why this is happening now, why the president is stirring these issues up at this moment with 24 hours before we decide this election, I'll leave that to you to conclude,'' he said.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV.

Is your snail mail overflowing with weirdly accurate political fliers? Do chipper canvassers pound on your door and recite scripts that seem tailor-made for you?\n\nIn the race to secure victory in an election former President Barack Obama called the \"most important of our lifetime,\" both political parties are using \"big data\" to micro-target voters. Information is so precise that many tools allow campaign managers to target individual voters with powerful and highly customized messages.\n\nBefore the internet, information used by political parties to target voters was generally limited to a voter's home address, voting history, party affiliation, and a few other simple data points. In the past decade, the amount of detailed information about voters has grown exponentially. Firms like L2 Political combine traditional voter information records with modern data files used by the most sophisticated internet marketing firms.\n\nImage: L2 Political\n\n\"[Our] data comes from a variety of sources, including states, and counties and municipalities that provide the raw voter data,\" said L2 Political vice president Paul Westcott. \"Once that data is brought in it is scrubbed against the national change of address database, the Social Security death index, and commercial files among scores of other checks. The commercial data comes from a variety of sources, including Experian.\"\n\nVoter data is then organized by computer algorithms, allowing campaigns to quickly sift and sort through the issues voters are most passionate about.\n\nL2 overlays the information on a map of the United States. Campaigns can zoom out to see the entire country, or zoom way in to get a clear view of states and voting districts. Campaigns can also export the information to common file formats like Microsoft Excel for further analysis by staffers.\n\nL2 Political\n\nThe interest graph information available in the L2 tool is extensive and allows campaigns to cross-reference demographic information with voter affinity related to hot-button issues like gun control, abortion, the border wall and marijuana legalization. That allows campaigns to craft and target direct mail, robocalls, canvassing routes and social media marketing.\n\n\"[After the 2016 campaign] people said they relied on analytics. They relied on these predictive models and at least that's what was being fed out publicly. Really at the end of the day, their models looked good. Their models were actually put together in a really solid way and the team there was among the best in the country,\" said Westcott.\n\nIn 2018, campaigns are using L2 and predictive analytics powered by big data to model outcome scenarios based on early voting data. Westcott said massive datasets can help campaigns micro-target small but influential groups of voters.\n\n\"[Precision data] is the core of what we're reaching out to when we're trying to get our 600 person sample or 1,000 person sample. So the core data matters. The underlying data matters,\" Westcott said.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV. Start a free trial", "", "ST. LOUIS \u2014 Two St. Louis day care workers are facing felony charges after preschool children in their care were encouraged to fight each other. St. Louis prosecutors charged 28-year-old Mickala Guliford and 22-year-old Tena Dailey with first-degree endangering a child. A summons was issued Monday.\n\nCBS affiliate KMOV reports police are searching for the women, and neither is in custody.\n\nKMOV\n\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports charging documents allege the two women encouraged the fistfights on Dec. 7, 2016. The fights were caught on video. They allegedly lasted 35 minutes and involved at least six children. The children each had a padded glove on one hand.\n\nOne 4-year-old suffered a black eye and other injuries. Mothers of two children are suing the Adventure Learning Center.\n\nBoth workers were fired after the incident. They were initially arrested, but charges reportedly weren't pursued by the St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office. A spokeswoman for the office told KTVI and the AP last week that charges wouldn't be filed due to insufficient evidence, adding \"that does not diminish the incredibly poor judgment by these adults who had the responsibility to safely supervise these children.\"\n\nOn Monday, the spokeswoman reportedly said that the office was able to obtain additional evidence.\n\nThe mother of one of the victims, Nicole Merseal, told KTVI that her older son, 10 at the time, filmed the fighting with his iPad because he was worried about his little brother, who was in the next room being beaten up by his classmates. The older boy sent the video to Merseal.\n\nMerseal told the station her younger son, who had just turned 4 that day, was crying in the video.\n\n\"He doesn't understand why his friends were fighting him. Why he was beaten up by his best friends,\" Merseal said.\n\nMerseal's lawyer, Jennifer Hansen, said in an email to the St. Louis Dispatch Monday: \"Ms. Merseal is humbled by the strong support of the St. Louis community in wanting justice for the kids at Adventure Learning Center who were forced to fight each other that day. Ms. Merseal remains hopeful that the state agencies in charge of supervising and subsidizing Adventure Learning Center will finally hold the day care accountable, too.\"\n\nAn attorney for the day care declined comment, citing the pending litigation.", "", "Election Day is poised to bring heavy rain, strong wind gusts and even potential tornadoes to various states across the U.S. where voters will be casting their ballots in competitive races.

Florida voters will also be choosing between Democrat Andrew Gillum or Republican Ron DeSantis as their next governor and between Sen.

In October, the pop star reportedly caused a spike in voter registrations both nationwide and in Tennessee when she spoke out on Instagram, and on Tuesday, she reminded fans to vote.\n\nSwift posted a video on her Instagram Stories saying: \"What is today? Tuesday. What was it that everyone is supposed to do today? What was it? Oh yeah, you gotta go vote today.\"\n\nThe \"Look What You Made Me Do\" singer said she feels encouraged by the newest generation of voters.\n\n\"I'm seeing a lot of underestimation of young voters and this new generation who now have the right to vote just in the last couple of years, but these are people who grew up post 9/11, they grew up with school shooting drills at their schools,\" she said. \"These are people who want to vote.\"\n\nShe continued and reminded her fans how powerful their votes can be.\n\n\"It's not enough to just want change. It's not enough to just want to vote,\" she explained. \"You have go and make change by voting and today is your opportunity to do that. I promise you it feels so wonderful to exercise that right that you have.\"\n\nShe concluded, \"Happy voting, you guys,\" and asked fans to tag her in their #justvoted posts.\n\nIn October, Swift wrote in an Instagram announcement that she is supporting Tennessee's Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, who is running against Republican Marsha Blackburn for Sen. Bob Corker's seat. According to the group Vote.org, Swift's post to her 112 million Instagram followers seems to have \"helped bring out young voters.\"\n\n\"A majority of new registrations since Sunday [October 7] have been from people between 18 and 29 years old,\" the group said in a release on October 9. About 64,000 out of the 105,000 total new registrations nationwide between October 7, when Swift made her announcement, and October 9, were in this age group.\n\nThe pop star -- who lived for several years in Tennessee -- explained to her Instagram followers that though she remained quiet in the past about her politics, she had to speak out against Blackburn because her \"voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me.\" Swift added, \"These are not MY Tennessee values.\" Swift objects to Blackburn's opposition to certain LGBTQ rights and her vote against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013.\n\nOn October 9, Swift talked about politics again at the American Music Awards. She was accepting the award for artist of the year when she urged viewers to vote.\n\nThe singer echoed her own political Instagram post and said, \"And you know what else is voted on by the people is the midterm elections on Nov. 6.

He said the plan to target the French president appeared to be vague and unfinalized but violent.\n\nAuthorities said the six were between 22 and 62 years old and included one woman. It is not known if they were suspected of working together.\n\nFrench presidents have been targeted several times over the decades, including in 2002 when a far-right sympathizer tried to attack President Jacques Chirac on the Champs-Elysees Avenue in Paris during Bastille Day celebrations.\n\nMacron was in the northeastern French city of Verdun on Tuesday as part of centenary commemorations for the end of World War I.\n\nThe suspected plot was uncovered days before U.S. President Donald Trump and dozens of other world leaders are due in France for commemorations this weekend of the signing 100 years ago of the Nov. 11 armistice that ended World War I.", "Campaign 2018: Election Hacking is a weekly series from CBS News & CNET about the cyber-threats and vulnerabilities of the 2018 midterm election.\n\nComputer systems around the world are vulnerable to cyberattacks. This includes voting machines, email networks, social media, and critical infrastructure that cities rely on to provide basic services. Yet none of these cyber-threats is as dangerous to the electoral process as the cumulative fear and uncertainty that hacking could change the outcome of elections.\n\nFor the CBS News series Campaign 2018: Election Hacking we spoke with more than two dozen experts, including current and former hackers, election security experts, former law enforcement agents, state election officials, former White House cyber-defense experts, and executives at the world's largest tech firms.\n\nAre they worried? Yes. They're paid to worry.\n\nBut they're also confident that come Tuesday, Election Day, their vote will be counted.\n\nThere is one threat that each expert worries about more than any specific vulnerability: The fear that hacking will undermine citizens' faith and confidence in election results. Whichever party wins control of Congress, imagine the consequences if half the country believes it was rigged?\n\nOn Monday, Department of Homeland Christopher Under Secretary Scott Krebs told CBS This Morning, \"We haven't seen certainly any compromises or any sort of access to election equipment across the United States at this point. But our planning factor is looking back at 2016 [to] see what the Russians conducted in terms of spearfishing campaigns And working to make sure those kinds of events don't happen again.\"\n\nEvery electronic voting machine is, essentially, a computer. All computers can be hacked, and the risks are abundant. The spectrum of hackers capable of attacking voting machines and voting systems is diverse, ranging from nation-states to hactivist groups. More worrying, these voting computers can be connected to voter registration databases, exposing critical data to manipulation.\n\nREAD: Hackers, trolls and the fight over your vote in the 2018 midterm elections\n\nBut Cris Thomas, a security researcher for IBM Security, is confident that his vote and the majority of Americans' votes will be counted accurately. Most states and electoral districts still use distinct voting processes and a diverse array of systems. That very diversity, says Thomas, strengthens the outcome of the overall vote. \"The resiliency of the electoral process will help ensure that citizens will have their votes counted and the right backups are in place to ensure it,\" Thomas says.\n\nTheresa Payton, former White House chief information officer, agrees that voting systems are vulnerable but not defenseless. \"I have a high level of confidence that my vote will be accurately counted,\" says Payton. \"The Board of Elections in each State have worked hard to assess their local processes, train their voting poll officials \u2026 to better understand the threats targeting the voting process.\"\n\nPolitical campaigns are ripe for hacking because they have an abundance of sensitive data, and are often underfunded with little budget for proper cyber-defense.\n\n\"What [Russian hackers] did in 2016 wasn't really all that sophisticated,\" says former hacker turned cybersecurity expert Kevin Mitnick. In 2016 a number of Clinton campaign staffers, including chairman John Podesta, fell for phishing emails sent by Russian hackers. Campaigns are still vulnerable to similar attacks, but technology firms like Google and Microsoft are actively collaborating with campaigns to increase security on email accounts and cloud data.\n\n\"A majority of what Google does to protect you is happening behind the scenes. A password manager, two-factor authentication definitely help, but even if you don't, we're able to prevent suspicious activity more than 99% of the time,\" says Google's Mark Risher.\n\nSocial media influence campaigns \u2014 the dissemination of online propaganda designed to sway voter opinion \u2014 are perhaps the most concerning \"cognitive hacks\" targeting elections because there's no clear solution to preventing them. Most large social platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google, have detected influence campaign content ahead of the 2018 midterms. The companies have been making efforts to crack down on such content, but they're playing catch-up as bad actors continue to test the limits.\n\nLeo Taddeo, a former FBI cyber specialist, is concerned that misinformation and the fear of hacking could prevent voters from going to the polls in the first place.\n\n\"I'm confident my vote will be counted accurately,\" Taddeo says. \"It would be very hard for a malicious attack to impact the voting infrastructure. I am more concerned with attempts to keep people from the polls through misinformation. For example, a 'fake news' report about the polls closing early.\"\n\nIt is possible that on Election Day there could be voting process irregularities. But regardless of what actually happens, we're likely to see a stream of stories about hacked machines, database manipulation, and social media posts from trolls \u2014 and that could be the greatest threat. The endgame of election hacking, says Payton, is to undermine our faith and confidence in the electoral process. \"Everyone should get out and vote and if you see something that seems suspect to you during the process, vote and report the issue. But if you don't vote, the bad guys win.\"\n\nLearn more:", "We take our music seriously at \"CBS This Morning.\" Keep up with the music we play on the broadcast by following our \"CBS This Morning\" Spotify playlist and checking CBSThisMorning.com for daily playlist posts.\n\n\"Mr. Brightside\" \u2013 The Killers\n\n\"Close Call\" \u2013 Rilo Kiley\n\n\"Bad Bad News\" \u2013 Leon Bridges\n\n\"Do You Want To\" \u2013 Franz Ferdinand\n\n\"Tell Me Tell Me\" \u2013 courtship.\n\n\"Stand\" \u2013 R.E.M.\n\n\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\" \u2013 Tears For Fears\n\n\"The Final Countdown\" \u2013 Europe\n\n\"Come Together\" \u2013 The Beatles\n\n\"These Are Days\" \u2013 10,000 Maniacs\n\n\"We Are Young\" \u2013 fun., Janelle Monae\n\n\"Ready to Start\" \u2013 Arcade Fire\n\n\"High Hopes\" \u2013 Panic!

Human feces,\" the former CEO of software giant Microsoft said. \"This small amount of feces could contain as many as 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 20 billion Shigella bacteria, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs.\"\n\nHe went on to say that pathogens like these cause diseases that kill nearly 500,000 children under the age of 5 every year.\n\nMore than 20 companies and academic institutions are exhibiting new toilet technologies at the three-day expo in Beijing, from self-contained toilets to a small-scale, self-powered waste treatment plant called the Omni Processor.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that Gates co-founded with his wife has spent more than $200 million since 2011 to stimulate research and development of safe sanitation technology.\n\n\"The technologies you'll see here are the most significant advances in sanitation in nearly 200 years,\" he said, according to a text of his prepared remarks.\n\nGates, and the expo itself, remained focused on the need -- driven by present and future water shortages and a lack of infrastructure in many parts of the world -- for toilets that process human waste without the need for water-fed sewers.\n\n\"For the first time we're really saying, 'can we make it more economic to avoid all of that?' And in the same way that a personal computer is sort of self-contained, not a gigantic thing, 'can we do this chemical processing actually at the household level?\"'\n\nUNICEF estimates that 4.5 billion people worldwide do not have access to safely managed sanitation, and that 480,000 children under 5 die every year from diarrhea, primarily in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

The new approvals cover Ivanka-branded fashion gear including sunglasses, handbags, shoes and jewelry, as well as beauty services and voting machines.\n\nThe approvals came three months after Ivanka Trump announced she was dissolving her namesake brand to focus on government work.\n\nChina also granted provisional approval for two \"Trump\" trademarks to DTTM Operations LLC, headquartered at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York. They cover branded restaurant, bar and hotel services, as well as clothing and shoes.\n\nAll the trademarks were applied for in 2016, and they'll be finalized if no objections arise during a 90-day comment period.\n\nBoth the president and his daughter have substantial intellectual property holdings in China. Critics worry that China, where the courts and bureaucracy are designed to reflect the will of the ruling Communist Party, could exploit those valuable rights for political leverage.\n\nPrepared to profit later?\n\nAnother concern is that the Trump family's worldwide intellectual property portfolio lays the groundwork for the president and his daughter, who serves as a White House adviser, to profit from their global brands as soon as they leave office.\n\n\"Ivanka receives preliminary approval for these new Chinese trademarks while her father continues to wage a trade war with China. Since she has retained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether President Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his family's businesses,\" wrote Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group that first published the news about Ivanka Trump brand's new Chinese trademarks.\n\n\"This is far from the first time that Ivanka's Chinese trademarks have raised ethics questions,\" the organization also said in a statement. \"In May 2018, Ivanka Trump's business received approval for several new Chinese trademarks a week before President Trump announced that he wanted to lift the ban on the Chinese company ZTE, for violating US sanctions. In 2017, the business received three new Chinese trademarks on the same day she dined with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\"\n\nLawyers for Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump in Beijing declined immediate comment.\n\nCompanies register trademarks for a variety of reasons. They can be a sign of corporate ambition, but many companies also file defensively, particularly in China, where trademark squatting is rampant. Trademarks are classified by category and may include items that a brand doesn't intend to market. Some trademark lawyers also advise clients to register trademarks for merchandise made in China, even if it's not sold there.\n\nChina has said it handles all trademark applications equally under the law.", "For four years, special needs student Kieran Johnson practiced with the Montwood High School football team and was their biggest supporter during games.

The spate of attacks has left authorities struggling to explain an apparent escalation in danger in an internationally-renowned vacation destination.\n\nThe 33-year-old victim was among 10 friends who set out from Airlie Beach on the Queensland state mainland on Monday morning on a rented yacht to sail themselves on a five-day cruise through the idyllic Whitsunday Islands, Police Inspector Steve O'Connell said.\n\nThey anchored 14 miles from Airlie Beach in Cid Harbor, intending to spend their first night in the popular, protected anchorage on Whitsunday Island, the uninhabited largest island in the group, he said.\n\nThe victim was taking turns with a woman standing on a paddle board or swimming in the harbor late Monday afternoon. He had dived into the water to give the woman her turn on the board when he was attacked, O'Connell said.\n\n\"They did everything imaginable to try to save the man\"\n\nThere were more than a dozen yachts in the harbor at the time. French-speaking tourists launched a dinghy from their yacht and rescued the man, O'Connell said.\n\nThey brought the victim to his own yacht, where most of the group had medical backgrounds, including two doctors.\n\n\"Despite their best efforts, the injuries were too severe,\" O'Connell told reporters.\n\nThe victim was taken by helicopter to the Mackay Base Hospital, 60 miles to the south, where he died.\n\n\"CPR was ongoing for a very long time and every solid effort was made to save that man's life,\" O'Connell said, referring cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\n\"They did everything imaginable to try to save the man.

This will not become information for the public or certainly not for the Sinaloa drug cartel.\"\n\nOn Monday, a potential juror was dismissed after she told the judge, \"What scares me is that...[Guzman's] family will come after jurors and their family.\" Another said: \"I'm nervous.\" Others were asked if they had watched popular Netflix shows about drug trafficking like \"El Chapo.\" A woman who watched \"Narcos\" was dismissed.\n\nGuzman's lawyers say the increased security measures create an unfair impression he is a violent man. He has pleaded not guilty to 17 counts of drug smuggling and money laundering.\n\n\"He's a mythical figure at this point. And if you read the books, the many books that have been written about him, even by the agents in the case, they even discuss it \u2013 they don't know what was real and what wasn't real,\" said Guzman's attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman.\n\nGuzman famously escaped from Mexican prisons twice, once in 2015 by riding a motorcycle through a mile-long tunnel. He was recaptured six months later and then extradited to the U.S. To prevent Guzman from escaping again, Marshals have even shut down parts of the Brooklyn Bridge so he can be moved from his Manhattan cell for all his pretrial hearings.\n\n\"No one wants to take the chance that something out of a 'Mission Impossible' movie happens, where suddenly a helicopter comes down and people come out of the water, and the next thing we know is that 'El Chapo' is gone. That is not going to happen during this trial,\" Klieman said.\n\n\n\nJurors will be partially sequestered for what's expected to be a four-month-long trial. There were also some moments of levity during Monday's jury selection. One man said he was a professional Michael Jackson impersonator and another admitted to eating a sandwich called \"El Chapo,\" which he said was \"delicious.\"", "MUENSTER, Germany -- A 94-year-old former enlisted SS man went on trial Tuesday in Germany, charged with being an accessory to murder for crimes committed during the years he served as a guard at the Nazis' Stutthof concentration camp.\n\nJohann Rehbogen is accused of working as a guard at the camp east of Danzig, which is today the Polish city of Gdansk, from June 1942 to about the beginning of September 1944.\n\nThere is no evidence linking him to a specific crime, but more than 60,000 people were killed at Stutthof and prosecutors argue that as a guard, he was an accessory to at least hundreds of those deaths.\n\nStutthof prisoners were killed in a gas chamber, with deadly injections of gasoline or phenol directly to their hearts or shot, starved and even forced outside in winter without clothes until they died of exposure, prosecutor Andreas Brendel said.\n\nRehbogen's role at Stutthof, and the trial\n\nThe former SS Sturmmann, roughly equivalent to the U.S. Army rank of specialist, does not deny serving in the camp during the war but has told investigators he was not aware of the killings and did not participate in them, Brendel said.\n\nRehbogen's attorney, Andreas Tinkl, has said his client will make a statement in the trial at the Muenster state court, which is scheduled to last until January, but it was not immediately clear when he would speak.\n\nRehbogen lives in the western municipality of Borken near the Dutch border. In deference to his age and health, the trial is being restricted to a maximum of two hours a day, with no more than two non-consecutive days a week. At the same time, because he was under 21 at the time of his alleged crimes, he is being tried in juvenile court.\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center, which helped locate some 20 Stutthof survivors for the case to serve as possible witnesses, emphasized that such trials are important, even more than 70 years after the end of World War II.\n\n\"The passage of time in no way diminishes the guilt of Holocaust perpetrators and old age should not afford protection to those who committed such heinous crimes,\" said the center's head Nazi hunter, Efraim Zuroff.\n\nMany survivors, along with relatives of victims, are also joining the trial as co-plaintiffs as allowed under German law.\n\nEven though the number of suspects is dwindling, the special federal prosecutor's office in Ludwigsburg that investigates Nazi war crimes still has multiple cases ongoing. In addition to looking at camps like Stutthof, Buchenwald, Ravensbrueck, Mauthausen and Flossenbuerg, it is also investigating former members of the mobile killing squads known as the \"Einsatzgruppen.\"\n\nLegal precedent set for Nazi camp guards\n\nThe legal reasoning that being a camp guard is itself enough to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of a crime, was first used successfully against former Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk in 2011.\n\nDemjanjuk was convicted in Munich on allegations he served as a Sobibor death camp guard. He always denied the accusation and died before his appeal could be heard.\n\nThe 2015 conviction of former Auschwitz guard Oskar Groening using the same argument, however, was upheld by Germany's top criminal court on appeal, cementing the precedent.\n\nThe Stutthof case is the first time a prosecution is going to trial using this line of reasoning for a concentration camp guard instead of a death camp guard. But prosecutors have expressed confidence it can be applied, since tens of thousands of people were killed in Stutthof even though its sole purpose was not murder.\n\nStutthof was established in 1939 and underwent several iterations, initially being used as the main collection point for Jews and non-Jewish Poles removed from the nearby city of Danzig on the Baltic Sea coast.\n\nFrom about 1940 onward, it was used as a so-called \"work education camp\" where forced laborers, primarily Polish and Soviet citizens who had run afoul of their Nazi oppressors, were sent to serve sentences and often died. Others incarcerated there included criminals, political prisoners, homosexuals and Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nFrom mid-1944, it was filled with tens of thousands of Jews from ghettos being cleared by the Nazis in the Baltics as well as from Auschwitz, which was overflowing, and thousands of Polish civilians swept up in the brutal suppression of the Warsaw uprising.", "NEW YORK -- Online leader Amazon Inc. refused comment Tuesday on reports that it plans to split its new, second headquarters between two locations.\n\nThe New York Times said the company is close to deals to locate the new facilities in Arlington, Virginia's Crystal City area, a Washington, D.C. suburb, and in the Long Island City section of the New York City borough of Queens.\n\nAmazon already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else except its current sole home base of Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area, the Times points out.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal said Dallas is also a possibility.\n\nCompany spokespeople reached by CBS News refused to comment on the stories.\n\nAn update from Amazon is widely expected soon.\n\nThe Journal said the main reason for having the two new facilities is to make it easier for Amazon to recruit enough talent.\n\nDividing the 50,000 employees expected to staff the new headquarters would also ease the pressure from demand for housing and transportation.\n\nThe newspapers cited unnamed people familiar with the matter in their reports.\n\nThe Times said Amazon executives met last month with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state had offered possibly hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of subsidies. They also met with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, the newspaper said.\n\n\"I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,\" the report cited Cuomo as saying.\n\nAmazon's decision to set up another headquarters set off an intense competition among municipalities.\n\nSome locations sought to stand out with stunts, but Amazon emphasized it wanted dollars and cents incentives, like tax breaks and grants. It also wanted a city with more than 1 million people, an airport within a 45 minute drive, direct access to mass transit and room to expand.\n\nThe company received 238 proposals before narrowing the list to 20 in January.\n\nAmazon has said it could spend more than $5 billion on the new headquarters over the next 17 years, about matching the size of its current home in Seattle, which has 33 buildings, 23 restaurants and 40,000 employees.\n\nThe company isn't leaving Seattle, and Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has said the new headquarters will be \"a full equal\" to its current home.\n\nAmazon already employs 600,000. That's expected to increase as it builds more warehouses across the country to keep up with online orders.\n\nThe company recently announced that it would pay all its workers at least $15 an hour, but the employees at its second headquarters will be paid a lot more -- Amazon says they'll make an average of more than $100,000 a year.", "Facebook has blocked 115 accounts federal authorities told it were acting suspiciously and might be \"linked to foreign entities\" and coordinating their activities. The online giant revealed the move in a blog post Monday -- the day before the all-important mid-term elections in the U.S.\n\nIn the post, Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Policy Nathaniel Gleicher said, \"On Sunday evening, US law enforcement contacted us about online activity that they recently discovered and which they believe may be linked to foreign entities.\n\n\"Our very early-stage investigation has so far identified around 30 Facebook accounts and 85 Instagram accounts that may be engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior. We immediately blocked these accounts and are now investigating them in more detail. Almost all the Facebook Pages associated with these accounts appear to be in the French or Russian languages, while the Instagram accounts seem to have mostly been in English \u2014 some were focused on celebrities, others political debate.\"\n\nGleicher added that Facebook would ordinarily be further along in its investigation of the accounts before going public about its moves but wanted to get the word out quickly since Election Day was at hand.\n\n\"Once we know more \u2014 including whether these accounts are linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency or other foreign entities \u2014 we will update this post,\" he concluded.\n\nThe Internet research Agency is a Russian-based entity caught up in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's February indictment of 13 Russian nationals and three companies. The indictment accused them of breaking U.S. laws to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.

It had barreled on, at times spectacularly, for more than a year.\n\nBefore a lone microphone stand and a group of reporters whose faces had become familiar, a visibly beleaguered Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat and the committee's ranking member, called the majority's decision a \"terrible disservice to the country and the American people.\"\n\nThe committee's unissued or unenforced subpoenas, and the overbroad privileges some witnesses managed to claim, added Rep. Jim Himes, D-Connecticut, had \"forever compromised\" Congress' power to undertake investigations.\n\nRep. Terri Sewell, D-Alabama, usually circumspect with the press about the investigation, said, \"Yesterday was a sad day.\"\n\n\"We reached a new low,\" she said quietly.\n\nThe preceding afternoon, while Congress was not in session and many of its members were away, Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas \u2013 who had led the Russia probe while the committee's Chairman, Devin Nunes, R-California, stepped aside amid an ethics investigation \u2013 had gathered a handpicked group of reporters to announce the end of the investigation and its principal conclusions. (CBS was not among those invited).\n\nThe committee had reviewed tens of thousands of documents, interviewed dozens of witnesses and visited seven countries as part of its investigation, Conaway said, and after more than 14 months of work the majority had determined it had the facts it needed.\n\n\"Bottom line: Russians did commit active measures against our election in '16, and we think they'll do that in the future,\" he said. \"We found no evidence that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it colluded with the Russians.\"\n\nIt was an ending \u2013 for its predictability, abruptness and relative understatement \u2013 discordant with an investigation that had roiled the media and left riven a committee whose charge it had historically been to remain undramatic and apolitical.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Republicans' announcement, Democrats vowed to pursue investigatory avenues they said had been overlooked, obstructed or willfully ignored. \"The work is too important to leave undone,\" Schiff said.\n\nNow, as major headlines have receded and some passions have subsided \u2013 and control of the House and the committee hangs in the balance \u2013 congressional leaders will face a pivotal choice about the committee's membership and its mandate. Both may determine its reputation and define its character for years to come.\n\nCommittee, heal thyself\n\nWithout question, observers of the committee agree, the status quo is problematic.\n\n\"It's one of the worst situations I've seen in the time I've witnessed it, from the creation of the Intelligence Committee\" in 1977, said former CIA Director and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, who earlier in his career spent 16 years in Congress. \"It's going to be hard to heal.\"\n\nBitter partisanship within the committee, Panetta said, exacerbated by President Trump's sometimes critical, often ambivalent posture toward the intelligence community, has brought about \"the worst of all worlds.\"\n\n\"Both parties are engaged in political warfare and it puts the intelligence community in a difficult position,\" Panetta said. \"I think obviously as a result of the politicization of the committee, the intelligence community [is] \u2026 going to think twice about presenting the full story,\" Panetta said.\n\nParticularly damaging for the committee were last winter's \"memo wars,\" during which both sides fought bitterly to publicly release fundamentally political documents containing classified information about the FBI's use of surveillance to monitor former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Over rare public admonitions from the FBI, which cited \"grave concerns\" about the release of the Republicans' memo, President Trump declassified its contents; he agreed only to the release of a redacted Democrat memo \u2013 which largely defended the FBI's work \u2013 after several weeks.\n\nAt around the same time, in what was perhaps the nadir of partisan tension, the majority considered building a wall between the staff members, who work in an undivided space. (That plan was shelved by March.)\n\nOne former senior Republican committee official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that, still today, current intelligence and law enforcement officials from multiple agencies \"fight about who has to go\" before the panel. \"They just dread going in there.\"\n\n\"It's very partisan. The questions aren't about good oversight of the intelligence business \u2013 they're about how to score political points,\" the former official said.\n\nSeparate from its breakdown on the matter of the Russia investigation, the committee has notched some successes \u2013 it helped usher through a reauthorization measure to extend Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Section 702 authorities and tended to most regular briefings and budgeting matters without incident. However, 2018 did mark the first time in six years that the committee failed to pass an Intelligence Authorization Act, which would have detailed spending priorities for the intelligence community. (Committee officials say provisions from the now-defunct 2018 bill are being folded into a 2019 bill that is expected to be finalized before the end of the year.)\n\nMark Lowenthal, who served as the committee's staff director from 1995 to 1997, said the committee, in apparently losing some of the intelligence community's trust, was abdicating one of its core responsibilities. \"You have to be their best friend and their severest critic,\" he said of the 17 intelligence agencies the committee oversees. \"If there's no one [the intelligence community] can go to, that becomes a serious problem.\"\n\n\"Because in a situation like this \u2013 as they say in Ghostbusters \u2013 'Who're you gonna call?'\" Lowenthal, now President and CEO of the Intelligence & Security Academy, said.\n\nMike Rogers, a former congressman from Michigan who was the committee's chairman from 2011 to 2015, agreed. \"The committee has been hindered in doing meaningful oversight because of the extreme partisanship. If oversight of the entire intelligence community doesn't happen here, it just doesn't happen,\" he said.\n\nRogers' erstwhile counterpart, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, who served as the committee's ranking member, reiterated the central importance to proper oversight of building relationships and trust. \"If you want to do your job of oversight you're going to have to have the respect of the intelligence agencies,\" he said. \"Without it, you're not going to get the information and data you need to oversee them.\"\n\nRogers and Ruppersberger were jointly recognized in 2015 with one of the intelligence community's most prestigious awards, INSA's William Oliver Baker Award, for the committee's bipartisan approach to oversight. During their tenure, the committee passed five intelligence authorization bills, traversed with minimal controversy the political minefields of the Benghazi investigation, and crafted significant cybersecurity and surveillance legislation.\n\nIn separate interviews, both Rogers and Ruppersberger noted they had assumed their posts just as the committee had, under previous leadership, suffered through a comparatively less severe period of politicization.\n\n\"When Rogers and I came in, we said, 'Look, this has got to change,'\" Ruppersberger said. \"It took us a long time to get our staffs to work together \u2013 but they did.\"\n\n\"I promised I wouldn't issue a subpoena if Dutch didn't sign off on it,\" Rogers said. \"As chairman, you have to have restraint.\"\n\nA former FBI field agent, Rogers said the intelligence community \u2013 including, and maybe especially, the FBI \u2013 will need reassurances that their work products will be treated as national security tools, not political weapons.\n\n\"They will more willingly submit to oversight if they know you're also trying to help them be successful,\" he said. \"Right now, the committee has got it all ass-backwards.\"\n\nWhat would Democrats do?\n\nPolls leading up to the midterms have vacillated just enough to keep both Republicans and Democrats nervous, and perhaps as a result relatively circumspect in their pronouncements.\n\nNo matter what happens on Election Day, it will be several months before the committee's membership is known \u2013 the intelligence committee is almost always the last one to be assigned its members. Who sits on the committee \u2013 and who leads it \u2013 will be the exclusive prerogative of congressional leadership.\n\nIf the House flips and Democrats on the committee are led by Schiff, who remains a clear favorite for chairman, current Democrat members and staff have said they intend to prioritize restoring comity to the committee and returning to the 'day job' of conventional oversight; they acknowledge civility may remain elusive if its current controversial chairman, Devin Nunes, stays on the committee as its ranking member.\n\n\"We're either going to have to live with him or work around him,\" one senior Democratic committee official said, expressing concerns that Nunes has \"no credibility with the people we oversee.\"\n\n\"We need that to effectively do our job,\" the official said.\n\nAmong the more nominal measures Democrats hope will bolster bipartisanship are arranging joint travel for staff and members and scheduling more public hearings \u2013 including a Worldwide Threats Hearing, whose last iteration was in February 2016. The committee may also amend some of the structure governing its subcommittees, which are now categorized, generally, by agency.\n\nSubstantively, it would dig into topics including the rise of authoritarianism, supply chain threats and foreign interference campaigns on social media, as well as an array of national security challenges posed by China, North Korea, Iran and Yemen, according to committee officials.\n\nThe biggest lingering questions about the Democrats' agenda, though, are to what extent the politically divisive Russia investigation is 1) continued and 2) thrust back into the spotlight. Since the Republicans shut down the investigation in March, two known witnesses \u2013 Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie and Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, wife of Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos \u2013 have voluntarily testified before the minority, each with minimal fanfare.\n\nIn a status update released last March, however, Democrats listed more than 30 witnesses and 20 entities they said were \"vital\" to arriving at an understanding of what happened in 2016. In order to conduct a \"legitimate\" investigation, the minority said at the time, it would have to interview Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, whose testimony Democrats called \"essential\" to a full understanding of core issues of potential collusion and obstruction of justice. (Each of those witnesses has pleaded guilty; Papadopoulos has also been sentenced.)\n\nAs some of the more forceful rhetoric about continuing the investigation has abated, the committee's Democrats generally, and for now, appear to be more willing to wait for findings to be issued by special counsel Robert Mueller \u2013 as well as for the final report of the Senate Intelligence Committee, whose investigation has continued, at least outwardly, in a more bipartisan fashion.\n\nClose observers of the House Intelligence committee seem to support that route. \"The issues related to the Mueller investigation ought to be handled by the Mueller investigation,\" Secretary Panetta said, \"and the committee ought to go back to overseeing the issues of the intelligence community.\"\n\n\"It doesn't mean they can't talk about some of these issues that have been raised in these past two years,\" he said.\n\n\"Let Mueller finish the job \u2013 he's a pro, he knows what he's doing,\" said Rep. Ruppersberger, though he added that Democrats, under Schiff, are entitled to follow through on issues they feel remain unfinished. \"The mission should be getting the facts,\" he said, \"But the only way it works is bipartisanship.\"\n\n\"Adam [Schiff], given the right tools, will do the job,\" Ruppersberger said.\n\nIt is not entirely clear how Schiff himself would have things go. He has publicly called for a broad swath of potential investigations into President Trump's finances and foreign connections. In a recent op-ed in the Washington Post, he wrote it would be \"negligent to our national security\" not to investigate \"serious and credible allegations\" of Russia's financial leverage over the president and the Trump Organization. In a statement to CBS, he said the committee would have to \"fully assess\" what areas of inquiry still require a full accounting, \"based on a review of the extensive body of information we have collected, along with what the Senate and the Special Counsel have uncovered.\"\n\nLowenthal acknowledged that the charged politics of the moment \u2013 and a given House speaker's agenda \u2013 could make it difficult for Schiff to cast aside the investigation entirely but that, as chairman, Schiff would have an opportunity to restore a sense of order to the committee by being transparent about his objectives and the measures he would use to achieve them.\n\n\"If the House flips and he becomes chairman, Schiff has a choice: how do you want to treat the minority? The way you were treated? Or do you want to treat them better?\" Lowenthal said.\n\n\"Of course,\" he added, \"that also depends on how the minority behaves.\"\n\n\"Schiff is not vindictive; he's always tried to work with Nunes,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-California. \"[He] believes the committee functions best when it works in a bipartisan fashion. I don't expect Schiff to change should we be in the majority. Nor would any of us want him to.\"\n\nOthers are less than sanguine that Schiff and Nunes will have much success repairing their relationship.\n\n\"I think if they're going to bury the hatchet,\" Rogers said, \"It'll be right between the shoulder blades.\"\n\nWhat would Republicans do?\n\nCommittee chairman Devin Nunes declined to be interviewed for this article, but a senior Republican committee official familiar with his plans told CBS News he \"intends to continue his work on the committee\" \u2013 whether or not Republicans keep the House.\n\nThough the Republicans' chances of maintaining the majority appear slim, they are not nonexistent. If Nunes remains chairman, the official indicated, the committee would prioritize finishing its work on what it says were FISA-related abuses that were committed by the Department of Justice and FBI as part of its Russia investigation.\n\nIn particular \u2013 and mainly because the committee is not in physical possession of the documents in question \u2013 that would mean lobbying the executive branch for the release of an additional twenty pages of the Carter Page FISA renewal application, a redacted version of which was released in July. Nunes has said publicly that those pages contain \"exculpatory information\" about Page.\n\nAlso among the documents Republicans would continue pushing to become public are memorialized interactions between DOJ official Bruce Ohr and former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, the author of a dossier on President Trump's potential ties to Russia whose unverified contents Republicans said were wrongly used to request surveillance on an American citizen. (The FBI has corroborated some parts of Steele's work, though details of what is unsubstantiated remain classified.)\n\nThe president has indicated he may make a move on declassification after the midterms. \"We are getting very close to doing what we have to do. I want to wait until after the election,\" Trump said in a recent interview with Fox News.\n\n\"Once that is out we think the big picture will be out there,\" the senior Republican committee official said, adding that Republicans would not consider any other methods \u2013 including memos \u2013 beyond declassification by the president.\n\nThe committee official acknowledged that the Russia investigation had taken its toll on the entire membership but said Nunes and Schiff have \"still managed to a large extent to work together on non-Russia things.\"\n\n\"It's been an unusual two years for everybody,\" the official said. \"I don't think there's a single person who got into it thinking they would be in the eye of the hurricane.\"\n\nOne former senior congressional official said, however, that Nunes has privately expressed a sense of vindication about what the majority's investigations have revealed, and that if he retained the chairmanship he would reopen or pursue new avenues \u2013 including a meaningful portion of DOJ and State Department targets recently taken up by the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees.\n\n\"He's said, 'If we keep the House, 20 subpoenas will drop on January 3rd,'\" according to the official, who requested anonymity to speak about non-public matters.\n\nAsked about the remark, a senior committee official told CBS News, \"Since he already referred dozens of the most crucial witnesses to Oversight and Judiciary, that seems unlikely to say the least.\"\n\nIf, in private, Nunes appears unwilling to relinquish certain inquiries, Republican sources are outwardly skeptical about Democrats' public pronouncements about returning civility and comity to the committee. They cite the media frenzy they charge Democrats with provoking and past instances where the minority used the Russia investigation to disrupt committee business \u2013 as when Schiff, during an open hearing in July on military threats from China, called for a vote to subpoena the interpreter present for President Trump's meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. (In his remarks, Schiff indicated the majority had declined a previous request for a vote during a business meeting.)\n\n\"If there was a ban on talking to the press I think that would restore some integrity and lower the resentment that some members have motivations other than supporting and overseeing the intelligence community,\" said Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Florida, who is retiring from Congress and his seat on the committee.\n\nNo matter what, the Republican membership will change meaningfully. In addition to Rooney, three current members \u2013 Reps. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, and Frank LoBiondo, R-New Jersey \u2013 are leaving Congress. Two \u2013 Reps. Will Hurd, R-Texas and Elise Stefanik, R-New York \u2013 are facing challenging reelection contests. And both Rep. Conaway and Rep.

He called the injunctions by three federal circuit courts that prevented the government from killing the initiative \"wrong\" and said they warrant the high court's \"immediate review.\"\n\n\"It's an extraordinary measure. It's a late, election eve decision,\" Greisa Mart\u00ednez, a DACA recipient and deputy executive director of the immigrant advocacy group United We Dream, told CBS News. \"(Mr. Trump) is trying to use the Supreme Court to move forward his political goals of wiping this country of young people of color.\"\n\nDACA, short for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was instituted by President Obama through an executive order in 2012. The program allows young undocumented immigrants, dubbed DREAMers, to obtain work authorizations and driver's licenses if they meet certain requirements, including having arrived in the U.S before they were 16 and obtaining an American high school diploma, GED or serving honorably in the military.\n\nAfter several conservatives states threatened to sue the Trump administration if it kept DACA alive, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a gradual winding down of the program in the fall of 2017. But the Second, Ninth and D.C. Circuits blocked the government from completely dismantling DACA.\n\nUSCIS currently allows more than 700,000 DACA recipients to renew their protections \u2014 valid for two years \u2014 but it is not accepting new applications.\n\nEchoing remarks by the president and his attorney general, Francisco argued the government had correctly decided to end the program \"based on serious doubts about its legality and the practical implications of maintaining it.\"\n\nThe third highest ranking official at the Justice Department mentioned that the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments on one of the DACA cases in May, has not yet issued a ruling. Francisco added that the Court should consolidate all the cases surrounding the program and take up the issue this term.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, DAPA \u2014 a similar Obama-era program which would have shielded around five million undocumented immigrants from deportation \u2014 was blocked by a 4-4 deadlock in the Supreme Court. The seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia's death had not been filled at the time.\n\nIf the court decides to accept the administration's request and review the DACA case this term, two justices appointed by President Trump will be sitting on the bench, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV.

The 76-year-old pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed. Federal transportation authorities said he was \"very experienced\" and it's too early to determine a cause of the accident.\n\nWilliam Troy Byler and Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, both 24, were killed in the crash shortly after midnight Sunday about 10 miles northwest of Uvalde, said Steven Kennedy, justice of the peace for Uvalde County Precinct 1.\n\nCraig Hatch, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said they will attempt to conduct a thorough initial examination of the wreck. However, the helicopter is located in a \"precarious\" spot on a side of a hill, a few miles from State Road 55, CBS affiliate KENS-TV reports.\n\n\"Because of how it's laid out on the side of the hill, we're not really able to go into the helicopter,\" Hatch said, adding that debris was scattered over about 100 yards.\n\nKENS-TV\n\nKENS-TV points out NTSB investigators usually document and examine a crash site as much as they can before altering anything, similar to a crime scene. However, Hatch said it's almost impossible to do in a way where NTSB members don't \"come tumbling down the side of the hill as well.\"\n\n\"We definitely saw a helicopter in a terrible state,\" said Rachel Kellner, a Texas Game Warden. Kellner was one of the first responders on the scene and said there was little they could do without any daylight.\n\nThe newlyweds were seniors at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, according to The Houstonian, the university's student newspaper. They married Saturday night at a large Byler family ranch near Uvalde and left aboard a Byler family helicopter after the reception, Kennedy said.\n\nLawrence had been a pilot for the family for years and had flown helicopters in Vietnam during his combat service, Kennedy said. An autopsy has been ordered on the pilot to determine if a physical condition might have been a factor in the crash, he said.\n\nHatch said Lawrence was \"very experienced (and) highly qualified,\" adding he believed he had logged about 24,000 hours.\n\nThe cause of the crash hasn't been determined, but Hatch said a preliminary NTSB report will be issued in about two weeks. KENS-TV said it's also too early to tell if weather played any substantial role in the crash.", "", "", "The U.S. Olympic Committee is moving to revoke USA Gymnastics' status as the governing body for the sport at the Olympic level, meting out the nuclear option to an organization that has botched its own reorganization in the wake of a sex-abuse scandal involving former team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nIn an open letter to the gymnastics community Monday, the committee's CEO, Sarah Hirshland, said \"you deserve better,\" and that the challenges facing USA Gymnastics are more than it is capable of overcoming as currently constructed.\n\nThe organization, even with a newly constituted board of directors, made repeated mistakes after the revelations Nassar molested Olympians while working as a volunteer. Those included the botched hiring of a program coordinator and an interim CEO to replace Kerry Perry, who lasted barely nine months on the job after replacing Steve Penny.\n\n\"This is a situation where there are no perfect solutions,\" Hirshland said.\n\nThe announcement comes only days after the U.S. team brought home nine medals from the World Championships in the first major meet on the lead-up to the Tokyo Games in 2020. Five of those were individual medals won by Olympic champion Simone Biles, who is among the athletes who have not hesitated to criticize the organization.\n\nBy decertifying USA Gymnastics, the committee is taking major action against an organization that couldn't grasp its own rebuilding. But the move also leaves a void that cannot be easily filled. In addition to supporting elite and Olympic athletes, USA Gymnastics serves more than 150,000 athletes in 3,000 clubs around the country. There is no other organization standing by to fill that need.\n\nThe federal law that governs the USOC gives the federation final say on which organizations represent each sport at the Olympics, and also establishes a process to decertify the organizations. Hirshland said she has given USA Gymnastics the option of surrendering its recognition voluntarily.\n\nUSA Gymnastics issued a statement saying it was looking at the USOC letter \"and is evaluating the best path forward for our athletes, professional members, the organization and staff.\"\n\nThe statement detailed the challenges the new board has faced since taking over in June.\n\nIt is in search of its fourth president and CEO in the last 19 months thanks to a series of resignations, all of them under pressure from the USOC or the gymnastics' community at large.\n\nPenny \u2014 named as a co-defendant in several civil lawsuits filed by former elite gymnasts \u2014 stepped down in March 2017. He was arrested last month and charged with destroying or hiding documents related to Nassar's activities at the Karolyi Ranch, the ex-national training center near Huntsville, Texas, where a number of gymnasts said Nassar abused them.\n\nThe organization named Perry as Penny's replacement but her ineffectual tenure lasted barely nine months. She came under fire from several high-profile gymnasts, Biles included, for failing to offer a clear vision on the way forward and quit in September. Her resignation came shortly after the hiring, then quick removal, of Mary Lee Tracy as elite development coordinator; Tracy had been supportive of Nassar when the allegations first surfaced.\n\nUSA Gymnastics brought on former U.S. Representative Mary Bono to serve as interim president and CEO last month. Bono didn't even make it a week, stepping away after drawing widespread criticism for an Instagram post she made shortly before she was hired that showed her coloring over the Nike logo on her golf cleats in response to the company putting former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick at the forefront of a marketing campaign.\n\nThe Indianapolis Star reported an attorney from the firm worked with Nassar to concoct excuses for missing USA Gymnastics events before allegations of his abuse became public.

Employees at the sports apparel maker were informed by email earlier this year that they may no longer charge visits to strip clubs on the company credit card, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe restriction reversed a long-time practice that included Kevin Plank, the company's chairman and CEO, the newspaper said.\n\nA spokesperson for Under Armour told the Journal the company doesn't condone use of adult entertainment for business, and Plank didn't conduct business at strip clubs or use company funds at such venues.\n\nPlank, a former football player at the University of Maryland, founded Under Armour in 1996, with the company growing into a global brand with almost $5 billion in annual revenue. Under Armour in September said it would cut its workforce by 3 percent by the end of March to reduce costs restructure its global operations.\n\n\"We have addressed these serious allegations of the past and will continue to address workplace behavior that violates our policies,\" Under Armour said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Inappropriate behavior that challenges our values or violates our policies is unacceptable \u2013 and will not be tolerated. We are committed to providing a respectful and inclusive workplace.\"\n\nUnder Armour did not comment on the specifics detailed by the Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter in reporting that executives and employees went with athletes to strip clubs after corporate events over the years.\n\nThe strip-club visits were among the practices that female workers at the company found demeaning, more than a dozen former and current employees and executives told the Journal. In addition, women were invited to a yearly Under Armour event based on their looks to entice male guests, the sources said.\n\nScott Plank, the CEO's brother, left Under Armour in 2012 amid allegations of sexual misconduct, people familiar with the matter told the Journal. At the time, the company said he'd retired to focus on another venture and philanthropy.", "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. \u2014 In the last days before the midterm elections, Sen. Claire McCaskill's political compass at times veers rightward. But she insists she's not one of those \"crazy Democrats.\" Nor is she a softy on that caravan of migrants the president calls a threat.\n\n\"I think that we have to make sure that we secure the borders and if there is an orderly process under the law that allows people to come to our borders to turn themselves in for asylum,\" she told CBS News.\n\nAP Photo\n\nLast week, McCaskill even said the president should use every tool at his disposal against the migrants. But on Monday, she clarified, and when asked if her support includes shooting at the migrants, she said \"no.\"\n\nA bit of positioning can be prudent politics. But critics say backing and then opposing the president is a bid to have it both ways in a state Mr. Trump won by almost 19 points.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, a lock-step supporter of the president, is challenging McCaskill and says she's a liberal -- plain and simple.\n\nLatest surveys show almost a dead heat between the candidates and because there's no early voting in Missouri, it's tough to gauge enthusiasm. So both campaigns are calling voters and making sure they get to the polls.\n\nWatch special election coverage live on CBSN on fuboTV.

Their mission is to keep caravans of Central Americans out.\n\nCBS News' Mireya Villarreal saw the steady stream of military vehicles in one south Texas border town. Where a week ago there was an empty field, there's now at least 300 troops. The soldiers are there as back up for Customs and Border Patrol agents.\n\nArmy specialists said their first big task is to help reinforce the ports of entry with new barbed wire fencing. They said they won't be going out on patrol.\n\nPresident Trump sent the troops to the border as part of Operation Faithful Patriot. Mr. Trump has blasted illegal immigration in the past, and called for the importance of border security. But the caravan has become a frequent topic at his rallies leading up to the midterm elections, and the president has also threatened to cut off aid to some Central American countries for failing to stop the migrants.\n\nThe bulk of that caravan is at a stadium near Mexico City, more than 650 miles away. There are reports that this deployment could cost upwards of $200 million.\n\nSome people living in the area are calling the move a midterm election stunt. But border patrol and local law enforcement say this is a dangerous area exploited by smugglers, so they welcome the help.", "An Amber Alert was issued Monday for a 13-year-old girl who was abducted outside her home in North Carolina, authorities said. The Lumberton Police Department said Hania Noleia Aguilar was kidnapped around 7 a.m. in the Rosewood Mobile Home Park.\n\nAguilar grabbed her aunt's keys to start her aunt's SUV before heading to school. A family member told police an unknown male wearing a yellow bandana over his face forced Aguilar into the vehicle and stole it while she was still inside.\n\nPolice described the SUV as a green 2002 Ford Expedition with paint peeling from the hood and a Clemson sticker on the rear window.

The question is, will they go to the polls?\n\nThe group NextGen started \"get out the vote\" events at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas a year ago, and the effort seems to be working.\n\nCompared with the 2014 midterms, 18 to 29-year-olds are really showing up for early voting in several hotly contested races including Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Nevada.\n\n\"I waited in line about 45 minutes and it was early voting,\" one voter said.\n\nThe Senate race is tight with former President Obama campaigning for Democrat Jacky Rosen, while the Trump family has been shoring up the base for incumbent Dean Heller.\n\nYoung voters have been unreliable in the past, but early voting in states like Nevada seem to be getting more out to the polls.

Republicans have a 240-seat majority, while Democrats control 195 seats \u2014 needing to net 23 to take control. The first party to 218 seats wins.\n\nMore than a year of polling and statistical models constructed by our teams at CBS News and other news outlets show that Democrats are expected to retake control, perhaps narrowly, and only if scores of voters who historically haven't voted in midterm elections show up to cast ballots.\n\nSo, what do Democrats need to do to retake control? Where could they do it and by what time Tuesday night? Here's an hour-by-hour look at the races that could flip control of the House, or reinforce Republicans' control of the chamber.\n\nCBS News\n\nAll times below are Eastern.\n\nPolls closing at 7 p.m. today\n\nPolls close in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia\n\nKENTUCKY: District 6\n\nWith apologies to Frank Sinatra, this is the \"New York, New York\" race of the night: If Democrats can make it here, they'll make it just about anywhere.\n\nRepublicans hope Rep. Andy Barr, R-Kentucky, holds on, proving that they can beat back what senior GOP operative calls \"celebrity Democrats\" \u2014 or challengers who've built up considerable name ID thanks to good national press and an over-eager national liberal donor base.\n\nDemocrat Amy McGrath is indeed a \"celebrity\" recruit of 2018. A former Marine fighter pilot, she was the first woman to fly an F/A-18 on a combat mission. Combine that life story with cinematic TV ads that recall how she was told as a young girl that she would never fly military aircraft, and it's an intoxicating brew in this political environment.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, noted in a recent interview with television reporters who cover Congress that since joining in the U.S. Senate in 1985, he has served with five different congressmen from this district: Three Republicans and two Democrats. In other words, it's a genuine swing district in competitive political years like 2018.\n\nVIRGINIA: Districts 2, 7, 10\n\nEarly indications of Democratic success Tuesday night will come from three Old Dominion districts.\n\nIn the 2nd, Rep. Scott Taylor, R-Virginia, is a former Navy SEAL facing a tougher-than-anticipated challenge from Democrat Elaine Luria. She's a Naval Academy graduate who served for 20 years. This is a race about health-care \u2014 and Democrats tried making noise about the Taylor campaign's involvement in a petition-signing scandal. It's a reach for Democrats, but a win here is indicative of a good night for Democrats. If he wins narrowly, it could signal a tighter majority for either party.\n\nIn the 7th, Rep. Dave Brat, R-Virginia, defeated then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary stunner. Ever since, he's been a thorn in the side of GOP leadership and usually a supporter of President Trump. But in a district that stretches from the Washington exurbs to the Richmond suburbs, that level of Mr. Trump support might not fly. Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer and a star recruit for her party, has pulled statistically even with Brat in a district the president won by 6 points.\n\nIn the 10th District, Hillary Clinton won handily in 2016. Democrats outnumber Republicans in a part of the commonwealth that is one of the wealthiest areas of the country. Tens of thousands of people who live here are federal workers or government contractors working for what Mr. Trump describes as the \"Deep State.\" Bottom line: If Democrat Jennifer Wexton doesn't win this district, Democrats have a big problem. But Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Virginia, is battle-tested and accustomed to close races and has managed to keep national Republican groups engaged in her race running ads on her behalf.\n\nIf she wins, did Comstock manage to successfully distance herself from Mr. Trump by speaking out against him starting in the final days of the 2016 presidential campaign after the release of the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape? Or did her push to pass sexual harassment legislation in Congress help ward off bigger losses among women? Stay tuned.\n\nPolls closing at 7:30 p.m. today\n\nPolls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia\n\nNORTH CAROLINA: Districts 2 and 9\n\nIf Democrats win either of these seats, Republicans will be reaching for the airplane barf bag. If Republicans win, then Democratic gains might not be as significant.\n\nThese two races are solid examples of something we've heard quietly from GOP operatives this entire cycle \u2013 too many long-time GOP congressmen failed to read the ebbs and flows of politics and were caught late in the campaign with small campaign accounts as a stronger-than-anticipated challenger started to surge.\n\nIn the 2nd, Rep. George Holding faces Democrat Linda Coleman, a former candidate for lieutenant governor. In the 9th, Rep. Robert Pittenger, R-North Carolina, lost a GOP primary, so Mark Harris, a pastor and former head of the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina, faces Democrat Dan McCready, a Marine veteran who makes a point of telling voters that while serving in Iraq, he converted to Christianity and was baptized in water from the Euphrates River. Either of those biographies make political consultants swoon.\n\nOHIO: Districts 1 and 12\n\nDemocrats say they don't need to make gains in the Buckeye State in order to retake the House, but wins here are further signs of GOP erosion in a state Mr. Trump won in 2016 \u2014 and needs to win again in 2020.\n\nIf Democrats don't have a good night, it could be because they came up short in places like Ohio's 1st District. This race began earning national focus over the summer, but it's faded a bit from most watch lists as Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, seems to have right-sided his prospects. He faces Democrat Aftab Pureval, the 36-year old Hamilton County clerk of courts, who's among the Democrats refusing to back House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, as caucus leader. If Democrats win more than 30 seats, it's because they won in places like this.\n\nThe 12th District may be familiar to some, as it was the subject of national focus in August during a special election. Rep. Troy Balderson, R-Ohio, prevailed by about 1,700 votes \u2014 an unheard of tally in a reliably Republican district. Democrat Danny O'Connor, the Franklin County recorder, gave Balderson a strong-than-anticipated challenge in a district that stretches from the backyard of Ohio State University into rural counties to the northeast of Columbus. A good night for Democrats across Ohio could make Balderson one of the shortest-serving members of Congress.\n\nWEST VIRGINIA: District 3\n\nCan a tattooed, Mr. Trump-supporting Army officer who happens to be a Democrat win back a congressional seat for his party? Maybe. And if Richard Ojeda does, to quote from the West Virginia licenses plates, it'll be a \"Wild and Wonderful\" night for Democrats.\n\nHe faces Republican Carol Miller, a member of the state House of Delegates. It's an open contest because Rep. Evan Jenkins opted to run in a three-way U.S. Senate primary and came up short. So, an Ojeda win would be an early example of the damage done by the dozens of GOP lawmakers who retired, quit under a cloud of scandal, or ran for higher office instead of running for reelection.\n\nPolls closing at 8 p.m. today\n\nPolls close in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee\n\nMap Data Provided by Tilegrams/NPR\n\nFLORIDA: Districts 6, 15, 16, 18, 26, 27\n\nThe 26th and 27th Districts are considered the most probable Democratic pickups, while any other wins would be gravy for Democrats and are likely driven by a strong showing and turnout for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum.\n\nIn the 6th District, Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Florida, quit to run against Gillum and it's an open seat at the eastern end of the infamous I-4 corridor. Democrat Nancy Soderberg, a former Clinton and Obama-era diplomat, faces Republican Michael Waltz, a former Army Green Beret and Fox News contributor.\n\nIn the 15th, Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Florida, is retiring and Democrats feel good about Kristen Carlson, who has a tailor-made background for the district: She's the former top lawyer at the Florida Department of Citrus. But Republican Ross Spano, a state legislator, hopes to keep the seat for his party.\n\nIn the 16th, Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Florida, faces Democrat David Shapiro, who's tried painting the incumbent as a scandal-tarred Washington establishment type. If Democrats win this seat, they're having an exceptional evening.\n\nThe 18th District is represented by Rep. Brian Mast, R-Florida, a star recruit from the 2016 cycle who faces Democrat Lauren Baer, who served as a top aide to secretaries of state John F. Kerry and Hillary Clinton and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power.\n\nThe 26th District \u2014 America's southern-most congressional district \u2014 is represented by Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Florida, a moderate and vocal critic of Mr. Trump who's done his best to stand apart from his party. Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell has kept much of her focus on health care and reminding voters that Curbelo is in the president's party.\n\nThen there's the 27th District, where Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, is retiring after finding herself increasingly at odds with her own party. Democrats nominated Donna Shalala, the former secretary of Health and Human Services and president of the University of Miami, while Republicans have Maria Elvira Salazar, who's banking on her past work as an anchor for Telemundo and Univision to win over viewers that remember her from local television newscasts.\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE: District 1\n\nRep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-New Hampshire, is retiring, sparking the only major competitive race in New England. Establishment-backed Chris Pappas hopes to keep the seat in Democratic hands, but Republican Eddie Edwards, a former local police chief also backed by national party leaders, could provide his party with a rare New England pickup. If Edwards wins, he'll be the first black Republican man to represent New Hampshire in Congress. If Pappas wins, he's the first gay man elected to Congress from the Live-Free-or-Die state.\n\nNEW JERSEY: Districts 2, 3, 7, 11\n\nThese races personify a few of this cycle's biggest trends: The viability of first-time female Democratic candidates; the potential damage done to the GOP by a record number of retiring Republican members; and whether the GOP's tax reform plan damages the party's chances in a highly-taxed state.\n\nThe 2nd District was once represented by Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-New Jersey, who was elected as part of the historic 1994 GOP wave but opted against another try. Democrat Jeff Van Drew faces Republican Seth Grossman in a contest to represent the Atlantic City area.\n\nIn the 3rd, Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-New Jersey, who helped craft the GOP tax cut plan by relying on his close personal relationship with Mr. Trump, faces Andy Kim, a former Pentagon official in a race that is a top Democratic target.\n\nIn the 7th, Rep. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, is in the race of his career against Democrat Tom Malinowski, a former Obama administration State Department official with deep pockets.\n\nThe 11th District is a suburban area in the northern part of the state \u2014 a genuine bedroom community for New York City. Democrat Mikie Sherrill is a standout Democratic recruit. A federal prosecutor and former Navy pilot, she's been airing TV ads in heavy rotation in the New York City market that show her flying a helicopter over her would-be district. She faces Jay Weber, the former chairman of the New Jersey Republican Party. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-New Jersey, is retiring \u2014 one of eight GOP chairmen retiring after this year.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA: Districts 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17\n\nEight competitive races in a state with 18 House seats means Democrats could retake the majority of the Keystone State's delegation. And in a state with no women representatives in Congress, it's safe to say there will be after Tuesday.\n\nIn the 1st, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pennsylvania, faces a challenge from Democrat Scott Wallace, whose grandfather Henry Wallace serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt's second vice president, in a race to represent south and central Philadelphia.\n\nThe 5th District is the commonwealth's former 7th District, and encompasses parts of greater Philadelphia. Republican Pearl Kim faces Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon in one of the contests that assures a woman will be elected into Pennsylvania's congressional delegation.\n\nThe 6th is a race between Democrat Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran and former sneaker company executive, and Republican Greg McCauley. Court-ordered redistricting across Pennsylvania made this an all-but assured Democratic pickup.\n\nIn the 7th, retiring Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pennsylvania, made way for Republican Marty Nothstein, an Olympic cycling silver medalist, to face Democratic attorney Susan Wild.\n\nThe 8th District is the only one in the state where Democrats could stumble. Rep. Matt Cartwright, R-Pennsylvania, represents a district that voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, so he faces a stronger-than-anticipated challenge from Republican John Chrin, a wealthy businessman who moved back into the district for the race.\n\nIn the 10th, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pennsylvania, could be a victim of the state's court-ordered redistricting. He faces Democrat George Scott, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, in a race that dramatically redrew Perry's district.\n\nIn the 11th, Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pennsylvania, faces a challenge in this southern conservative district from Democrat Jess King, another first-time female congressional candidate. Democrats argue that Smucker's embrace of Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant messages will not resonate in a district that the president won by 26 points, but that also has a large Mennonite population and is active in resettling refugees in the United States.\n\nIn the 17th, Rep. Conor Lamb, R-Pennsylvania, who won a closely-watched special election earlier this year in an adjoining district, moved north to challenge Rep. Keith Rothfus, R-Pennsylvania, in this redrawn Pittsburgh-area district. Lamb has a growing lead of Rothfus, according to recent polls.\n\nPolls closing at 8:30 p.m. today\n\nPolls close in Arkansas.\n\nARKANSAS: District 2\n\nThis is a late addition to most nonpartisan forecasts and the stakes here are very simple: If Rep. French Hill, R-Arkansas, is in a close race with Democrat Clarke Tucker, then blue tsunami warnings are being issued nationwide.\n\nPolls closing at 9 p.m. today\n\nPolls close in Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin, Wyoming.\n\nThis the magic hour, when a huge number of states close and tallies are completed in eastern states, likely laying out who's set to take control. Most attention will turn to some of the biggest Senate races and most notable gubernatorial contests, but pay attention to these key races:\n\nARIZONA: District 2\n\nRep. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, is retiring to run for the U.S. Senate, so former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Arizona, faces Republican Lea Marquez Peterson. Kirkpatrick moved to this district to try to head back to Washington, while Marquez Peterson is a star GOP recruit and a bit of a unicorn for her party: Conservative, a woman and Latina.\n\nCOLORADO: District 6\n\nRep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, is a perennial Democratic target. He's facing a strong challenge from Jason Crow, an Army veteran and an early Democratic recruit. The Denver-area district is packed with immigrants that Coffman has effectively won over in the past, but Mr. Trump's sustained unpopularity in districts like this might be enough to unseat Coffman.\n\nKANSAS: Districts 2 and 3\n\nIn the 2nd, Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kansas, is retiring, so Republican Steve Watkins, a retired Army Captain who once raced the Iditarod, faces Democrat Paul Davis, a former state legislator who announced he was running for Congress and promptly declared his opposition to Pelosi. Winning in this Topeka-area district would be a big coup for Democrats.\n\nDitto in the 3rd, where Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kansas, faces Democrat Sharice Davids, who could be one of two Native American women elected to Congress this year. She's touted her connections to former president Barack Obama, since she served as a White House fellow during his administration. That a Democrat would openly tout such connections in a state like Kansas shows you how confident Democrats are of their chances.\n\nMICHIGAN: Districts 8 and 11\n\nThe 8th District is a pure toss-up, where Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Michigan, faces Democrat Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA and Pentagon official. She's running an ad that mentions her mother's death from cancer and runs footage of Bishop at the White House on the day that House Republicans and Mr. Trump held an elaborate White House South Lawn celebration of their ultimately futile attempt to undo the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn the 11th, Rep. Dave Trott, R-Michigan, is retiring, so Democrat Haley Stevens faces Republican Lena Epstein. Stevens is considered a standout Democratic recruit who fits the district well given that she worked for the Obama administration's auto rescue task force. But Epstein is the co-owner of an automotive distributorship \u2013 so both have backgrounds that help in this suburban Detroit district. (Full disclosure: Steven was a college classmate of mine.)\n\nMINNESOTA: Districts 1, 2, 3, 8\n\nBy the time polls close in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, either party may be just on the verge of the magic 218. And it's a state where both parties could suffer losses.\n\nIn the 1st, Rep. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota, is retiring to run for governor, and his party might lose his seat. Democrat Dan Feehan faces Republican Jim Hagedorn in a seat that the GOP is confident they can take back.\n\nIn the 2nd, Rep. Jason Lewis, D-Minnesota, faces a strong challenge from Angie Craig, a former health care executive who has run before for Congress. Democrats are highlighting past controversial comments by Lewis, a former radio show host.\n\nIn the 3rd, Rep. Erik Paulsen, R-Minnesota, a frequent Democratic target, faces Democrat Dean Phillips, the heir to a liquor fortune who once ran the Talenti Gelato company. This is a suburban district \u2014 just the type that Democrats are confident they can win this year.\n\nNEW MEXICO: District 2\n\nRep. Steve Pearce, R-New Mexico, is retiring to run for governor, so Democrat Xochitl Torres Small faces Republican Yvette Herrell in a district that stretches along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nNEW YORK: Districts 19, 22, 24\n\nThese three parts of the state \u2014 basically drawn to protect some of the only GOP pockets left in the Empire State \u2014 have a tendency to swing back and forth between whichever party is having a good year. So, don't be surprised if one or all of these go from red to blue.\n\nIn the 19th, Rep. John Faso, R-New York. faces Democrat Antonio Delgado, a Rhodes scholar and former rapper who cleared a crowded field and has raised millions of dollars to become a top party recruit. Faso has aired ads highlighting some of the racy lyrics Delgado used to drop during his stint as \"AD the Voice.\"\n\nThe 22nd District encompasses Utica and Binghamton and is often a central New York swing area. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-New York, a fierce Mr. Trump supporter, faces Democrat Anthony Brindisi, a state legislator who has also vowed not to back Pelosi as Democratic leader.\n\nIn the adjoining 24th District, Rep. John Katko, R-New York, who GOP leaders consider one of the members most in tune with his own district, faces Democrat Dana Balter.\n\nWISCONSIN: District 1\n\nCan Randy Bryce win the seat currently held by retiring House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wisconsin? He faces Republican Bryan Steil, who has focused on Bryce's checkered personal past in hopes of keeping ahead.\n\nTEXAS: Districts 7, 23, 32\n\nIf Democrats can win any of these states, they've easily won the ballgame. The 7th is represented by Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, another one of those incumbents that party operative grumble didn't do enough to stay competitive. He faces Democrat Lizzie Fletcher in what would signal the ongoing demographic and political shifts in urban Texas.\n\nIn the 23rd District, Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, faces Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones in the district with the longest stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. Hurd, a former CIA operative and the only black man in the GOP caucus, has cast himself as an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, especially on issues of tone and immigration policy, and Republicans like his chances. If Jones wins, she'd be among the up to three Latinas elected to Congress from Texas this year.\n\nThe 32nd District is much like other suburban swing districts. Stretching from Dallas out towards predominantly Latino communities, Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, chairman of the powerful Rules Committee, faces Democrat Colin Allred, a former Tennessee Titans player who served in the departments of Housing and Urban Development and Justice during the Obama administration.\n\nFun fact: George H.W. Bush lives in the 7th District. George W. Bush lives in the 32nd District. By the end of the night, the once-king and prince of the Republican Party might live in Democratic-controlled districts.\n\nPolls closing at 10 p.m. today\n\nPolls close in Iowa, Montana, Nevada and Utah.\n\nIOWA: Districts 1 and 4\n\nIn the 1st, Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, won his seat in the 2010 tea party-backed wave, but he was among the first GOP lawmakers to face the ire of angry constituents at contentious town hall meetings last year, is trailing Democrat Abby Finkenauer, a 29-year old state legislator, who would be among the marquee Democratic standouts of the cycle. And if she wins, she'll receive dozens of calls on Election Night and the days after from Democrats who want to run for president in 2020. In recent days, potential presidential candidates Sens. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, and Kamala Harris, D-California, have sent fundraising emails on her behalf.\n\nNEVADA: Districts 3 and 4\n\nCongressional races are usually close in this Las Vegas-area seat.\n\nThe 3rd District is represented by Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nevada, who is stepping down to run for U.S. Senate. In her place, Democrat Susie Lee faces Republican Danny Tarkanian, who jumped into the race instead of challenging Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, to a nasty GOP primary.\n\nThe 4th District is what we could call a repeat episode. Former Rep. Steven Horsford (D) faces former Rep. Cresent Hardy (R) in a rematch of their 2014 race. Hardy beat Horsford that year, but then lost in 2016 to Rep. Ruben Kihuen, D-Nevada, who is stepping down after facing allegations of inappropriate behavior with former campaign staffers and state lobbyists.\n\nPolls closing at 11 p.m. today\n\nPolls close in California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii.\n\nCALIFORNIA: Districts 10, 21, 25, 39, 45, 48, 49\n\nCBS News is tracking seven competitive races in the Golden State, but Democrats say they could win up to 10 seats here. We'll see.\n\nIn the 10th, Rep. Jeff Denham, R-California, an advocate for bipartisan immigration reform, faces Democrat Josh Harder. In the 21st District, Rep. David Valadao, R-California, another top Democratic target, is being challenged by T.J. Cox. In the 25th District \u2014 home to the Ronald Reagan Library \u2014 Rep. Steve King, R-California, is up against Democrat Katie Hill.\n\nThe next three districts are all in Southern California, where Clinton prevailed in 2016.

Mimi Walters, R-California, faces Democrat Katie Porter, a former law school student of Sen.

He faces Democrat Harley Rouda, a real estate investor who won a contentious primary by just a few hundred votes.\n\nIn the 49th District, Rep.

She was shot more than 20 times as she shielded her children. Her daughters, Emily and Brooke, didn't make it, but Ryland and his stepsister, Rihanna, survived.\n\nAssistant fire chief Rusty Duncan, a first responder on the scene, found Ryland that day. He had been shot five times\u2014one wound for each year of his short life\u2014and the injuries he sustained from the AR-15 style rifle were extensive. When Rusty carried him out of the church, another medic assumed Ryland was already dead and pulled out a black tag. In triage, a black tag is used to mark the deceased and those whose injuries are so extensive they will not survive treatment. But Rusty refused to put a black tag on the young boy in his arms.\n\nIt has taken 24 surgeries to repair his arm, leg, pelvis, intestines, kidney, bladder and hip\u2014but one year later, Ryland Ward is still surviving. Now with the help of therapy, doctors are working to make sure the six-year-old's recovery is more than physical.\n\n\"He's a delightful kid, you know, full of life, full of energy,\" said Dr. Donna Roybal, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and the director of a pediatric PTSD clinic at University Hospital in San Antonio. \"Definitely has a lot of those resilient factors, that resiliency that you wish you could bottle up in some ways. But [he] also struggles, as you would expect a child who has gone through that would have.\"\n\nRyland began psychiatric care very soon after the shooting. At University Hospital, Dr. Roybal set up her clinic in the same location as pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Lillian Liao, who also treats Ryland. The proximity makes it easier for patients like Ryland to couple psychiatric care with their medical care.\n\nIn her treatment, Dr. Roybal uses trauma-focused play therapy. As Ryland explores the toys in the room, Dr. Roybal can analyze his feelings from how he's playing and what he's playing with. During a recent appointment, Ryland played with an ambulance\u2014which is a good sign, according to Dr. Roybal.\n\n\"He wasn't afraid to play with it,\" Dr. Roybal told correspondent Scott Pelley in the video above. \"Some kids don't want to think about what happened to them at all and will avoid that toy entirely.\"\n\nWhen Dr. Roybal directly asks Ryland about his feelings, he usually tells her he feels happy. But that's never the emotion he feels the most. His predominant feeling typically swings between sad and angry. Dr. Roybal said her task now is to help him process what happened so he can mitigate those emotions.\n\n\"Part of our job is to help him understand and make sense of it in his world so that he's not angry, so that he's not sad to the point where it's going to interfere with his life,\" Dr. Roybal said.\n\n\"He's not a quitter\"\n\nRusty Duncan is also helping.\n\nOne year ago, the first responder didn't know anyone was alive when he carefully stepped through the aftermath of the shooting at the First Baptist Church. Then, a small hand reached out and grabbed his pant leg. It was Ryland, lying out of sight underneath his stepmother.\n\n\"When I pulled Ryland out of the church, it was almost like nothing else crossed my mind,\" Rusty said in the video above. \"Like, I didn't think about anybody else. I didn't even know Ryland. But for some reason that day, I didn't think of anybody else the whole time.\"\n\nRusty hasn't been able to forget Ryland since that November morning. After visiting Ryland in the hospital, Rusty has taken him to the movies and invited him over to play with his own children. Today, he considers them \"friends for life.\"\n\nRusty even teaches his new friend martial arts at his nearby studio. Ryland, a boy whose injuries were so grave that a medic assigned him a black tag, is now breaking boards with his hands and feet.\n\n\"He's not a quitter,\" Rusty said. \"He's not afraid to try new things. Yeah, he's pretty amazing.\"\n\nRyland's foundation\n\nRusty is now working with Ryland and a family friend to start a foundation called R.I.D.E., which stands for Ryland's Improvements and Developmental Education. The foundation isn't to raise money for Ryland, but rather, to help future victims of trauma and mass shootings. It will focus on developing education and awareness to help prevent an event like the First Baptist Church shooting, and it will encourage young children to talk more openly about trauma, domestic violence, and bullying. Ryland's story of tragedy and survival is the centerpiece of the foundation.\n\nFor more information about R.I.D.E., contact Rusty Duncan, Rdtkd09@gmail.com, or Benjamin Reed, omicon3@yahoo.com.\n\nTo watch Scott Pelley's report about the guns used in mass shootings, like the one at the First Baptist Church, click here.\n\nThe video at the top of the page was edited by Sarah Shafer Prediger.

Clemente Aguirre-Jarquin, then a 24-year-old undocumented immigrant from Honduras, found the bodies of Cheryl Williams and her mother, Carol Bareis, in their Altamonte Springs home, but told authorities he didn't call police for fear of being deported.\n\nThe victims had been stabbed multiple times. Aguirre-Jarquin reportedly told authorities he got the victims' blood on his clothing when he checked to see if they were breathing and picked up a knife near the bodies, fearful the killer was still in the area, but then panicked and threw it in nearby bushes. He was arrested shortly after the slayings, was convicted and received the death penalty in 2006, but has maintained his innocence, WKMG reports.\n\nIn 2016, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously overturned Aguirre-Jarquin's conviction and death sentence based in part on new DNA testing of blood stains on crime scene evidence that cleared Aguirre-Jarquin and implicated someone else \u2014 Samantha Williams, the victims' daughter and granddaughter. The Innocence Project, a non-profit legal aid group that took on Aguirre-Jarquin's case in 2011, said Aguirre-Jarquin's court-appointed attorney at his original trial didn't request the DNA testing, calling the representation \"woefully inadequate.\"\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court also heard evidence that Williams confessed the crime to several friends and acquaintances, according to the Innocence Project. Aguirre-Jarquin spent nearly 15 years behind bars, 10 of them on death row.\n\n\"Mr. Aguirre was nearly executed for a crime he didn't commit,\" Joshua Dubin, one of Aguirre-Jarquin's attorneys, said in a statement. \"While we are overjoyed that his ordeal is finally over, the case of Clemente Aguirre should serve as a chilling cautionary tale about how dangerous it is when there is a rush to judgment in a capital case.\"\n\nDespite the Florida Supreme Court's ruling, State Attorney Phil Archer announced he would re-try Aguirre-Jarquin and again seek the death penalty. But on Monday, amid jury selection in the second trial, Archer announced he would drop all charges. According to the Innocence Project, the decision came after new testimony emerged in pre-trial hearings that undermined Williams' alibi.\n\nWilliams has not been charged with any crimes. In a statement released to WKMG, Archer said, \"While the State has serious concerns about the credibility of Mr. Aguirre-Jarquin's statement of facts regarding his participation in this incident, the State does not believe further incarceration of Mr. Aguirre-Jarquin is warranted or justified at this time. We appreciate the efforts of his attorneys in presenting this new evidence.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the state attorney's office told WKMG prosecutors will be meeting with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office in coming weeks \"to review the evidence and determine if there are any investigative avenues that can be pursued, or any further action to be taken in this case.\"\n\nA photo released by the Innocence Project shows Aguirre-Jarquin in court, apparently overcome by emotion. \"I have only forgiveness in my heart for those who did wrong to me,\" Aguirre-Jarquin said in a statement released by the Innocence Project.\n\nAguirre-Jarquin, now 38, walked out of a detention facility Monday afternoon, wiped away tears and hugged his legal team and supporters, The Orlando Sun-Sentinel reports. However, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reportedly placed an immigration hold on Aguirre-Jarquin on Friday. He now faces possible deportation.\n\nHis lawyers said they will pursue an asylum claim for him, though experts tell the paper it would be an uphill battle. \"If there were ever a person that deserved a chance to become a United States citizen, it is Clemente Aguirre,\" Dubin told the paper.", "", "", "FORT WAYNE, Ind. \u2014 A confident President Trump left Washington for three rallies to close his campaign blitz ahead of the midterm elections.

The odds are longer for Republicans or Democrats emerging with majorities in both chambers.\n\n\"Divided government equals gridlock,\" said Terry Haines, head of U.S. policy and political analysis at Evercore ISI. \"Gridlock is a good thing for markets because markets like certainty.\"\n\nHere's a look at how the market might react to the different scenarios:\n\nSplit decision\n\nIn the scenario in which Democrats regain control of the House, major policy initiatives from the White House will be dead on arrival. Compromise could be difficult, especially if the Democrats move to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Democrats might find common ground with the GOP in some areas. Agreement on an infrastructure bill could boost construction equipment and transportation companies. And legislation to control drug pricing would likely be a drag on pharmaceutical company stocks.\n\nA Democrat-led House could also lead to heightened oversight and investigations of big banks and Wall Street firms, which could weigh on financial sector stocks.\n\nThe possibility of a government shutdown also increases with a divided Congress, according to a report from UBS on the potential impact of the midterm elections. That could unnerve investors. The S&P 500 slumped nearly 20 percent during the government shutdown that occurred during Congress' 2011 debt ceiling impasse.\n\nThe blue wave\n\nThe odds of the Democrats taking both houses of Congress have diminished of late, possibly to the relief of Wall Street.\n\nIn this scenario, Democrats could push to shore up the Affordable Care Act, but any move to reverse the Trump administration's hefty tax cut on corporations or its steady rollback of government regulations on businesses could be fruitless in the face of Trump's veto.\n\n\"With this in mind, this election is really about how dysfunctional Washington will be for the second half of President Trump's first term,\" Mike Ryan, chief investment officer, Americas, for UBS Global Wealth Management, noted in the company's report.\n\nMore of the same\n\nShould Republicans remain in control of Congress, it's likely the Trump administration will try to make the personal tax cuts included in last year's reform package permanent. Also on the possible to-do list: reforming entitlements, more easing of government regulations on banks and other businesses, and perhaps tackling the issue of drug price controls, according to the UBS report.\n\nIf the GOP extends its majority, the party also could push to lower capital gains taxes and enact an infrastructure spending bill.\n\nThe midterms add to the uncertainty that has buffeted the market for the past month.\n\nAfter a solid third quarter that saw records for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials, stocks have swooned on fears that rising interest rates and the U.S. trade dispute with China could undo some of the benefits of the GOP tax cuts and eventually squeeze corporate profit margins. October snapped a six-month winning streak for the S&P 500, giving the benchmark index its worst monthly loss in seven years.\n\nStill, regardless of how the midterm elections turn out, history suggests stocks will be fine.\n\nThe S&P 500 has generated an average price return of 16.7 percent in the 12 months after each of the midterm elections going back to 1946, according to CFRA.

We will catch you,\"Herrera said in a news release. \"Most importantly, we preserved more than 45 housing units to be used as homes, not hotel rooms. We are fighting back against San Francisco's housing crisis.\"\n\nCritics say Airbnb drives up rental prices and reduces housing availability in cities including San Francisco and New York City.\n\nThe high cost of housing in San Francisco has prompted tighter enforcement of vacation rental laws that took effect earlier this year. Those laws by and large prohibit property owners from offering multiple listings.\n\nUnder the court-approved settlement, the Lees can't offer short-term rentals in any of 17 buildings in San Francisco that they own or manage. The couple paid $276,000 to settle a previous case in 2014 in which they evicted tenants to convert a property into short-term rentals.\n\nAirbnb and competitor HomeAway are required to register all vacation-rental listings with the city, which conducts checks to make sure the hosts actually live in the rentals.\n\n\n\n", "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Shaquille O'Neal and Ken Jeong are TV's latest odd couple.

The pilot, with the working title \"Unqualified,\" could be the basis for a series.\n\nThe concept: O'Neal and Jeong try to master jobs including mall rent-a-cop, substitute schoolteacher and train conductor.\n\nThe two are already qualified for quite a few jobs. O'Neal was one of the highest scoring NBA players ever before he became a sports commentator and a fast food entrepreneur; he owns more than 100 Five Guys burger restaurants in addition to a Krispy Kreme store. Jeong was a surgeon before he got into acting. In fact, Jeong provided aid to an audience member at his comedy set when she had a seizure in May.

But closing arguments have brought that contrast into clearer view.\n\nMr. Trump, and Republicans running in states and districts where the president is popular, are making the election all about immigration. I have heard lots of Republican voters bring his issue up voluntarily, specifically the caravan. In Las Vegas, for example, I talked to two immigrants supporting Mr. Trump \u2014 one from Malaysia and one from India \u2014 who described the caravan as an invasion. Mr. Trump used immigration as a calling card in 2016, and believes it will be as successful in 2018.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are laser focused on health care. They believe they are on offense in the issue (a remarkable shift from from the previous four elections) because it's such a personal issue for people. The party that is seen as threatening change when it comes to health care gets blamed (i.e. Democrats in 2010).\n\nAfter talking to Democratic candidates and voters alike, the concerns about health care involve: rising premiums, threats of taking away coverage for pre-existing conditions, rising costs of prescription drug prices, changes to Medicare and Medicaid, etc. Health care is an economic issue for Democrats \u2014 a way to negate positive economic news that might otherwise benefit Republicans. Their argument is that yes, the economy may look good on paper but people are still anxious about health care coverage and costs.\n\nEven if Democrats claim the House, expect Mr. Trump to declare victory by virtue of the Senate.\n\nTrump is on the ballot\n\nMidterms are usually a referendum on the president and party in power. But this one is feeling more and more like a presidential election, with turnout expected to be historic for a midterm. And in certain states, Mr. Trump is arguing that he is on the ballot, and that a vote for a Republican candidate it a vote for him. His campaign schedule is intense, and designed to get his voters to turn out for Republicans. This is a difficult task, one that President Obama couldn't do in 2010 and 2014. But Mr. Trump is still planning to leave it all on the field.\n\nDemocratic voters in battleground districts appear to be fueled by Mr. Trump as well. While Democratic candidates in these key races don't focus on the president \u2014 nearly every candidate and campaign I've spoken don't want to talk impeachment \u2014 they know that negative reaction to Mr. Trump is driving their voters. As much as Mr. Trump is a boon to Republicans in red states, he is also a one-man get out the vote effort for the Democratic base.\n\nThe big question I have is whether Mr. Trump can transfer his coalition in a midterm.\n\nI spoke with one Trump voter in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, in a Democratic district that voted for Mr. Trump, who said she loved the president, but wasn't sure about the congressional candidates or whether she would vote. She thinks Mr. Trump is beating all her expectations and needs more allies, but she wasn't convinced a vote for a Republican was a vote for Mr. Trump.\n\n\"I don't consider myself a full-blown Republican or anything...it depends on the person,\" said Lori Coleman, who manages a vape store and voted for Obama in 2008 and Mr. Trump in 2016.\n\n\"Just because they're an ally [of Mr. Trump] doesn't mean I like them. Because they could say they're an ally for attention. They could say they're an ally just to get votes. And that's what bothers me. I'm more or less going to vote for someone who actually, truly cares about change. Not everybody who says they like Trump is actually a good person or actually cares.\"\n\nIt's the economy, stupid. But is it?\n\nThe economy is good, but Mr. Trump's approval numbers don't seem to match. At rallies recently he has admitted that talking about the economy isn't exactly the barn burner that other cultural flashpoints are. The philosophy is that, at least in midterms, people tend to vote out of anger or fear. Just as you don't normally call your utility company to praise them for good service, you may not feel compelled to turn out in an election just to say thanks. A good economy may also give voters the bandwidth to think about other things when it comes to voting.\n\nThat's not to say Republicans are ignoring it. GOP candidates in tough districts can use the economy to argue that things are headed on the right track, despite the president. This can play particularly well in states like Florida and Nevada, battlegrounds that were among the hardest hit by the recession. It could play well with women, who are often the heads of the households when it comes to making economic decisions. And it could help Republican candidates looking to carve out a compelling identity separate from the president.\n\nThis can all create a challenge for Democrats, who want to show contrast but don't want to appear to be cheering against good economic news. Democrats have been using the GOP tax bill in their economic pitch, arguing that middle class earners could have gotten a bigger break and the legislation has added to the debt. Democrats have also seized on Mitch McConnell arguing that entitlement programs, not the tax bill, are the greatest drivers of the debt and should be reformed. Over the past week, I have heard many Democratic candidates reference McConnell's words.\n\nA new midterm electorate?\n\nWith turnout anticipated to make records for a midterm, I'm interested to see what the winning coalitions will look like. Democrats have been arguing that in difficult races like Texas, they are aiming to turn out voters who typically don't participate in midterms \u2014 young and minority voters, in particular. They are counting on over performance among these groups to make up the gaps in polling.\n\nFlorida, Florida, Florida\n\nIt's difficult to find a state that better encompasses all of the above themes. The governor's race between Andrew Gillum and Ron DeSantis is a base versus base election. And since they're both young, it could help tell us something about the future of their respective parties.\n\nMr. Trump narrowly won the state, and it will be critical to his own 2020 bid. How does this race drive turnout across the ballot? The U.S. Senate race is critical, as are two districts that went for Clinton: the 26th and 27th. Younger voters will be a deciding constituency, as they are beginning to outpace older voters there, Florida political analyst Susan MacManus has told me. National issues from guns to immigration to the economy and the Hispanic vote are all coming into play in Florida.\n\nAnd on the Hispanic vote: As both parties battle to turn out Latino voters, it's important to remember it's not a monolithic group. And the president's rhetoric on immigration is playing differently among different groups. I spoke with Cuban, Colombian and Venezuelan immigrants in Miami and they were largely supportive of Trump and Republicans. They said that they didn't want to see the United States become like the countries they left. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican running for Congress in Florida's 27th congressional district, told me that sentiment is powerful in her district, even as she disagrees with the president's rhetoric. I found a similar sentiment among two Latin American immigrants I spoke with in San Antonio who were supporting Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nBut Democratic congressional candidate Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, an immigrant from Ecuador running in Florida's 26th congressional district, told me this about the president's rhetoric on immigration: \"As an immigrant, I can tell you that it's been very offensive\u2026.We are seeing images of people living in desperation. We need to find some common ground and really talk about immigration and have those conversations that are tough to have, but we need to find real solutions.\"\n\nDemocrats in Trump Country\n\nThere are dozen Democratic districts that Mr. Trump won in 2016, as well as governor and U.S. Senate races in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Democrats are well positioned in all of them \u2014 many of them poised to win. Is the tide turning back to Democrats in the Midwest and Rust Belt? Or is this temporary, a result of either poor-performing Republican candidates or voters not responding to candidates not named Trump. Alternatively, are the president's policies on trade and taxes turning supporters away from the GOP?\n\nI'm also keeping my eye on whether voters split their tickets in these areas, thanks to high name recognition. In Ohio, for example, could voters back both Republican Mike DeWine for governor and Democrat Sherrod Brown for Senate?\n\nDemocrats in these areas have carved out a separate identity from the Democratic party, while still campaigning on party themes around health care and the tax bill. Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright, who represents a Trump district near Scranton, told me last week, \"What I am hearing is that people know how hard I work for them around here and how much I care about them. And that's why in the neighborhood of 33,000 people in northeastern Pennsylvania voted for Donald Trump and Matt Cartwright on the same ballot two years ago. I'm the same guy, and they're the same people.\"\n\nRepublicans in Clinton Country\n\nThere are two dozen GOP districts Hillary Clinton won that are top targets for Democrats this cycle. (Most are in California, New Jersey, New York, and Florida. But also, keep an eye on Kansas!) Voters have shown an appetite for splitting tickets there before. Will this time be different? Can a GOP incumbent convince voters he or she is different from the president?\n\n\"This is a highly educated district, and people in this district vote for the candidate. And proof of that is Hillary Clinton carried the district and I carried the district,\" Republican Rep. Leonard Lance, of New Jersey's 7th congressional district, told me recently. \"The most important issue is bipartisanship. That's what I hear about most...I treat everybody with civility and respect. I think I am well known for that.\"\n\nOn the Senate side, we are watching Nevada, where GOP Sen. Dean Heller up for re-election in a state Clinton won. But Heller also won election, narrowly, in 2012 at the same time Obama carried his state.\n\nWho Run the World?\n\nAs Beyonce would say: Girls. But in the case of the 2018 election, it's college-educated women, specifically. This is the most influential group when it comes to the battle for control of the House, which runs through the suburbs. According to our CBS polling, a vast majority of college educated women vote in midterms and plan to do so in November. A plurality want their vote to send a message to Mr. Trump. And most name health care as a top issue.\n\nPolls show white, college-educated women are backing Democrats this cycle by a significantly greater margin than they did in 2016. Clinton won this particular demographic by just six points in the last presidential contest. Today, various polls show white, college educated women backing Democrats by upwards of 30 points. Another key demographic: Black women. This voting group was a top factor in electing Doug Jones to the Senate in Alabama last year, and figures to be just as consequential this week.", "NEW YORK - Ride-hailing companies are capitalizing on voter enthusiasm ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections by offering free or discounted rides to the polls in shared cars, bikes and scooters.\n\nThey say they're aiming to remove what many consider a barrier to voting: lack of transportation.\n\nMidterm elections are often marked by low voter turnout, but political watchers are expecting voter angst over which party will control the U.S. House and Senate, as well as lingering anger by both major parties over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, to drive more Americans to cast votes.\n\n\"This midterm election season has gotten in the bloodstream of the American people in a way that has not happened before,\" said Stephanie Young, spokeswoman for When We All Vote, a nonprofit that has partnered with Uber and Lyft to get voters to the polls.\n\nWhen We All Vote is co-chaired by Michelle Obama and helps people register and vote. The organization is technically nonpartisan, but several on its list of celebrity co-chairs such as Tom Hanks and Chris Paul have been vocal critics of President Donald Trump.\n\nLyft is also working with Voto Latino -- whose co-founder Rosario Dawson has urged voters to choose Democrats to combat Trump's immigration policies -- as well as nonprofit organizations that help blind people and student veterans to distribute discount codes and identify where free rides are needed.\n\nLyft's efforts have been promoted on social media by celebrities such as actor Samuel Jackson, another Trump critic.\n\nUber is offering $10 off rides to the polls across the country and added a feature in its app that helps customers find their polling stations by typing in a home address.\n\n\"We want to do our part\"\n\n\"In this critically important election, we want to do our part and use Uber's technology to help drive the vote,\" said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in an email. \"Decisions get made by those who show up, and we believe Uber can help voters show up like never before.\"\n\nZipcar, which allows members to rent cars on an hourly basis, is offering a $20 credit on election night, enough to cover about two hours of driving, said spokeswoman Katelyn Chesley. Zipcar has been offering discounts for election-related rides since the company was founded in 2000, Chesley said.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who have really busy schedules during the daytime, and we just really want to make sure every last voice is heard,\" Chesley said.\n\nThis is the second time Lyft has offered discounted or free rides to the polls and Uber's first.\n\nEliminating a \"pain point\"\n\nIn 2016, 15 million eligible voters cited transportation as a key reason why they didn't vote, according to The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, so \"we want to use our platform to eliminate that pain point from the voting process,\" said Mike Masserman, head of social impact at Lyft, in an email.\n\nMotivate, which operates most of the bike-share programs in the U.S., is offering free day passes to ride bikes on Election Day in nine of its markets for the first time. Lime is offering free rides on its bikes and scooters.\n\nUber is cleaning up its public relations image in preparation for an initial public offering next year, and the Election Day promotion is \"a clear sign of extending goodwill to consumers while deploying clever marketing tactics,\" said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director of private investment research at SharesPost.\n\n\"Let's not forget that these companies have had a lot of clashes with communities, and this is sort of a nice way for then to show their support for communities,\" said Mike Ramsey, senior research director at Gartner. \"They're probably touching into the Zeitgeist that these elections are very important to a lot of people on both sides.\"", "New research suggests some people may be more genetically susceptible to severe symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), the Alzheimer's-like brain disease associated with repeated blows to the head. The study, from researchers from the Boston University School of Medicine and the VA Boston Healthcare System, is part of a growing effort to better understand the degenerative disease that disproportionately affects military service people, football players and other contact-sport athletes.\n\nCTE is largely believed to stem from repeated head trauma. It can lead to memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, and eventually progressive dementia.\n\nResearch published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year on 202 former football players found evidence of the disease in nearly all of them. These athletes included those who played in the NFL, in college, and even in high school. CTE has also made headlines as a number of high-profile former NFL players, including Frank Gifford and Ken Stabler, have been diagnosed with CTE posthumously in recent years.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica Communications, suggests a genetic variation in a gene called TMEM106B could help explain why CTE affects some individuals more severely than others.\n\n\"We know that people can have more or less severe CTE disease even when they've had a similar amount of head impacts or contact sports participation. Genetic variation between people might account for some of this difference,\" study author Thor Stein, M.D., Ph.D., told CBS News. Stein is a neuropathologist at VA Boston Healthcare System and assistant professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nThe researchers drew from their bank of more than 600 brains donated by families of deceased military service members and athletes. They decided to concentrate on 86 brains of former football players, all of whom had been diagnosed with CTE.\n\nThe nature and frequency of head injuries made football players the ideal sample size to study genetic factors for CTE, the researchers said.\n\nThe team identified two distinct categories of TMEM106B genetic variation within the sample. About 60 percent of the participants had a major genetic variation and the remaining 40 percent had a minor genetic variation.\n\nThose with the major genetic variation were 2.5 times more likely to have severe CTE symptoms, have higher accumulation of p-tau (a feature associated with other neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's), and dementia during their lifetimes.\n\nThe researchers do not yet know how TMEM106B influences the development of CTE, but they are working to better understand the relationship. Previous research has found that the gene also plays a role in the development of other neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS and Alzheimer's.\n\nAs it stands today, CTE can only be diagnosed by studying a person's brain after death. The researchers hope that their discovery may one day be used to help predict which people, while they are still alive, are most likely to develop severe symptoms of CTE.\n\n\"Understanding the genetic risk factors might allow us to predict who will be most at risk for disease and therefore who to follow more closely clinically and get treatment when possible,\" Stein said. \"Genetic risk factors can also provide clues for possible mechanisms that lead to disease and help guide how we might eventually target treatments for CTE. Down the line it may also be helpful to inform individuals before they engage in an activity associated with repetitive head impacts.\"\n\nHowever, he notes that while genetic variation may alter the course of the disease, \"the greatest risk factor is environmental, namely repetitive hits to the head.\"\n\nThe researchers say TMEM106B is likely just one of many genes that may play a role in CTE risk and they are actively looking for others in an effort to better understand the disease.", "JAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 The \"black box\" data recorder from a crashed Lion Air jet shows its airspeed indicator malfunctioned on its last four flights, investigators said Monday. Hours earlier, distraught relatives of victims confronted the airline's co-founder at a meeting organized by officials.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Committee chairman Soerjanto Tjahjono said the problem was similar on each of the four flights. That number included the fatal flight on Oct. 29 in which the plane plunged into the Java Sea minutes after taking off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nErratic speed and altitude on the plane's previous flight, from Denpasar on Bali to Jakarta, were widely reported. \"When we opened the black box, yes indeed the technical problem was the airspeed or the speed of the plane,\" Tjahjono told a news conference.\n\n\"Data from the black box showed that two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta also experienced the same problem,\" he said. \"In the black box there were four flights that experienced problems with the airspeed indicator.\"\n\nTjahjono said that he hoped to have a detailed preliminary report within a month, CBS News' Selvanaban Mariappen reports. Indonesian investigators, the plane's manufacturer, Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are formulating a more specific inspection for Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes related to the airspeed problem, Tjahjono said.\n\n\"If there are urgent findings to be delivered, we will convey them to the operators and to the manufacturer,\" he said. Lion Air has said a technical problem with the jet was fixed after problems with the Bali to Jakarta flight.\n\nReuters\n\nInvestigator Nurcahyo Utomo said investigators need to review maintenance records, including what problems were reported, what repairs were done, including whether components were replaced, and how the repairs were tested before the two-month-old plane was declared airworthy. \"Currently we are looking for the cause of problem,\" he said.\n\n\"Whether the trouble came from its indicator, its measuring device or sensor, or a problem with its computer. This is what we do not know yet and we will find it out.\"\n\nAt the meeting with family members, Tjahjono had said that information downloaded from the jet's flight data recorder was consistent with reports that the plane's speed and altitude were erratic after takeoff on its final flight. Searchers are still trying to locate the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nRusdi Kirana, Lion Air's co-founder, was not invited to speak by Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi, who moderated the meeting between relatives and the officials who are overseeing the search effort and accident investigation. But he stood and bowed his head after angry and distraught family members demanded that Kirana, who with his brother Kusnan Kirana founded Lion Air in 1999, identify himself.\n\n\"Lion Air has failed,\" said a man who identified himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, a prosecutor in a district on the island where the flight was headed. \"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,\" he said.\n\n\"Since the time of the crisis, I was never contacted by Lion Air. We lost our child, but there was no empathy that Lion Air showed to us.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from reporters. Many families face an agonizing wait for missing relatives to be identified.\n\nPolice medical experts have received nearly 140 body bags of human remains and have identified 14 victims. Relatives questioned why the plane had been cleared to fly after suffering problems on its Oct. 28 flight from Bali that included a rapid descent after takeoff that terrified passengers.\n\n\"Lion Air said the problem was fixed, is it true the problem was cleared?\" asked Bambang Sukandar, whose son was on the flight. \"If not, technicians in charge must be responsible.\"\n\n\"The law is absolute,\" he said, \"because they have stated that the plane was cleared to take off again. These bad technicians must be processed by law to prevent plane accidents from continuing in Indonesia.\"\n\nTjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the relatively small area the debris was found in showed the plane hit the water at a very high speed.\n\n\"The plane was intact when it plunged to the sea, it did not explode in the air, and the aircraft engine was running when it touched the water at high RPM \u2014 it's marked by the loss of all blades of the turbine,\" he said. The Lion Air crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flight near Medan.\n\nIn December 2014, an AirAsia flight from Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea, killing all 162 on board. Lion Air is one of Indonesia's youngest airlines but has grown rapidly, flying to dozens of domestic and international destinations.\n\nIt has been expanding aggressively in Southeast Asia, a fast-growing region of more than 600 million people.", "COLLEGE PARK, Md. \u2014 Social media platform Gab, where the suspect in the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre spewed anti-Semitic messages, is back online roughly one week after domain registrar GoDaddy and other internet services dropped the site.\n\nGab returned on Sunday after a Seattle-based company, Epik, accepted the site's domain registration.\n\nGab suspended the account belonging to Robert Gregory Bowers, the man charged with killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue last month, shortly after the attack. On its Twitter account, Gab posted a message Sunday that said it \"will not be defined by the actions of one individual.\"\n\nGab has been a haven for racists and anti-Semites who have been banned from Twitter for hateful and harassing behavior. Gab's founder and CEO, Andrew Torba, has portrayed his site as a bastion of free speech.\n\nThe platform has also accused the media of mischaracterizing Gab. \"If you joined Gab today and found out that it wasn't everything the media made it out to be, perhaps you should be asking yourselves what else it is they lie about,\" the site said over Twitter on Monday.\n\nGab launched in 2016 as an alternative to larger social media platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook, which the company claims in an SEC filing \"continue to crack down on 'objectionable content'\" and \"censor conservative views.\" In the same SEC filing Gab highlights the users of \"conservative, libertarian, nationalist, and populist\" sites, such as Breitbart, Infowars and Drudge Report, as its target market.\n\nGab went offline following the Oct. 27 shooting at Tree of Life synagogue, which killed 11 people and injured six others. The intense spotlight on the site also seems to have hindered its efforts to raise money \u2014 the site lost more than three dozen small investors in the days immediately following the shooting.

In the robocall, a male voice says: \"This is the magical negro, Oprah Winfrey, asking you to make my fellow negress, Stacey Abrams, the governor of Georgia.\" Audio of the robocall was posted on social media.\n\nThe call also refers to Abrams as a \"poor man's Aunt Jemima\" who \"white women can be tricked into voting for, especially the fat ones.\"\n\nIf elected, Abrams would be the nation's first black female governor. She got a boost last week when Winfrey joined her for two campaign appearances. Former President Barack Obama has campaigned for her as well.\n\nThe real Winfrey responded to the calls Monday night in an Instagram video, saying she is \"100% for\" Abrams, and urging people to vote. \"Jesus don't like ugly. And we know what to do about that: Vote.\"\n\nKemp, the Georgia secretary of state, has had his own high-profile campaign visits from President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. In a statement Friday, Kemp said the robocall was \"vile\" and \"absolutely disgusting.\"\n\n\"This automated call is absolutely disgusting,\" said Kemp. \"I stand against any person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry. These vile efforts to degrade and disparage others are contrary to the highest ideals of our state and country. We unequivocally condemn this group and their horrible actions.\"\n\nThe governor's race in Georgia has also raised repeated accusations of voter suppression. On Sunday, Kemp's office said it had launched an investigation into the state Democratic Party over \"a failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system.\" Abrams dismissed the investigation as lacking evidence and part of a pattern of voter suppression efforts. \"There is no evidence, there's not even a conversation about Democrats having anything to do with this,\" Abrams said in a \"CBS This Morning\" interview.\n\nA similar racist robocall has targeted voters in Florida, where Democrat Andrew Gillum, vying to become the state's first black governor, is running neck-and-neck with Republican Ron DeSantis.\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the Road to Power records campaign robocalls and also posts \"racist and anti-Semitic videos and commentary on bitchute and Gab, platforms that have voiced no objection to hosting white supremacist and extremist ideologues.\"", "WASHINGTON \u2014 The brash shareholder activist Evelyn Y. Davis, who owned stock in more than 80 public companies and rarely failed to make her presence known at corporate-investor meetings, has died. She was 89.\n\nFor decades, Davis was notorious among executives at blue chip companies for raising a ruckus at annual meetings, sometimes turning the typically staid affairs into yelling matches.\n\nSimultaneously confrontational and flirty, she would demand that a CEO resign, while letting on that she found the executive to be attractive.\n\nDavis relished attention, good or bad.\n\n\"There's no other woman like me!\" she would say. \"There's no other shareholder like me!\"\n\nDavis died Sunday in Washington.\n\nAP\n\nHeld in a Nazi concentration camp\n\nEvelyn Yvonne De Jong was born to a wealthy family in Amsterdam in 1929, two months before the stock market crash pitched the globe into the Great Depression.\n\nWhen World War II swept over Europe, Davis and some members of her immediate family, which had Jewish roots, were interned at a concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, a detail confirmed by the International Tracing Service, a respected archive of Holocaust-era documents.\n\nDavis moved to the Baltimore area after the war with her neurologist father, finished her education and began investing in the 1950s.\n\nIn a biography filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission when she sat on a panel about shareholder rights, she described herself as \"a four times Divorcee with NO children.\"\n\nStocks, she liked to say, were her children.\n\nHot pants and a bandolier\n\nAnd it seemed she would do anything to advocate and raise attention for what she believed to be the safest path for her investments. She wore a bathing suit to the General Motors meeting in 1970, donned hot pants for another company's meeting and put on a bandolier for a third.\n\nAt United Aircraft, she nominated baseball star Hank Aaron to the board. It was 1974, just after Aaron beat Babe Ruth's home run record.\n\nAs Davis got older, her outfits became less outlandish. She favored expensive suits, always showing up perfectly coiffed. But there was no polishing or toning down her candor. She'd interrupt other shareholders, speak over CEOs and race to the microphone when the floor was opened for comments so that her voice was heard first.\n\nAt a Home Depot meeting in 2007, she heckled then-CEO Frank Blake. \"You're a phony, Frank!\" she yelled. At Bank of America in 2010, she told CEO Brian Moynihan that he looked like her handsome first ex-husband (three more were to follow). The next year, she chewed out Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein for the regulatory fines that the bank had racked up. She told Blankfein, however, that it wasn't personal ... that he wasn't so bad-looking.\n\n\"That's manipulating the male ego,\" Davis said later. \"I'm very good at that.\"\n\nHer bravado paid off occasionally, and after extended campaigns. In 2005, Macy's mandated that board members stand for reelection every year instead of every three years.\n\nThat had been a 17-year goal for Davis.\n\n\"Highlights and Lowlights\"\n\nDavis consistently ensured her proximity to power. She got herself press credentials to cover White House briefings. When she bought a Jaguar, it was personally delivered by Bill Ford, the great-grandson of the company founder and also an executive.\n\nShe pushed her annual newsletter, \"Highlights and Lowlights,\" onto the same CEOs she harangued, charging $600 a copy. She insisted that each executive buy two of them.\n\nShe liked to introduce herself as queen of the corporate jungle and issue press releases about the latest proposals, and latest divorces, of \"Evelyn Y. Davis, Famous Shareholder Activist.\"\n\nIn 2012, when she was 82, Davis failed to attend a single shareholder meeting. And for the first time since 1965, she didn't publish \"Highlights and Lowlights.\"\n\nContacted by The Associated Press that year, Davis explained, \"I'm not so young anymore.\"\n\nNonetheless, in ensuing interviews with the AP, she wanted to be described as \"a woman of mystery and intrigue,\" and asked how dull shareholders meetings had become without her in attendance.\n\nThe inscription on a tombstone that Davis commissioned years ago reads: \"Power is greater than love, and I did not get where I am by standing in line, nor by being shy.\"", "A divided American electorate, already shattering voting records for midterm elections, will decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday. That's making investors more jittery than usual ahead of the final vote counts.\n\nA renegotiated and renamed North American Free Trade Agreement will need Congressional approval. Also potentially on the legislative agenda are enormous economic issues like another income tax cut, rising drug prices, a substitute for Obamacare, federal spending increases (or cuts) and a ballooning public deficit fueled by the last GOP income tax cut.\n\n\"Most of my days are spent talking to clients about what are the polls showing, which way are the winds blowing, what could the implications be. This, of course, touches on everything: trade policy, infrastructure, the Fed raising interest rates,\" Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nBetting markets, as well as polls from CBS News and other outlets, indicate the House of Representatives is likely to swing to a Democratic majority, with the GOP keeping a slim margin in the Senate.\n\nWhatever happens on Tuesday, here is how the results are likely to play out in major areas of the economy.\n\nStocks likely to rise in \"relief rally\"\n\nA dismal October wiped out most of the market's gains this year, while an elevated VIX, an index that measures market volatility, suggests more day-to-day mayhem is possible. The good news is that the stock market jitters will likely end as soon as the midterms do\u2014regardless of who the winners are. Research shows that historically, nearly every U.S. election since the World War II has been followed by a so-called relief rally, where stocks rise at least modestly.\n\n\"Historically, stock market volatility increased ahead of the elections due to policy uncertainty. However, stocks also tended to rebound strongly coming out of midterm election-year lows,\" LPL Financial wrote in a research note last month. \"We are now entering the most favorable part of the four-year presidential cycle.\"\n\nGlobal trade in the crosshairs\n\nTariffs and trade are finding their way into the elections, too. Though the White House renegotiated a trade agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, Congress must approve it \u2014 something that becomes less certain with a Democratic-controlled House in January. And the effects of Mr. Trump's already imposed and threatened tariffs on steel and aluminum, cars and trucks, and goods from China are seeping into corporate finances large and small. Millions of jobs are at stake, and prices are rising for consumer goods from autos to food to televisions.\n\n\"It comes down to what can be done with executive orders and what has to go through Congress,\" Deutsche Bank's Slok said. \"Congress will probably play a bigger role in trade policy. The majority in the House will probably start showing more interest in trade policy.\"\n\nCongress controls the nation's purse strings. That, Slok notes, could produce \"quite a changed landscape in what's possible with Congress.\"\n\nGridlock is good? Really?\n\nIf Democrats gain control of the House, or even the Senate, gridlock will almost certainly ensue. That threatens President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda, a proposed second round of tax cuts, infrastructure spending, or potential cuts to Social Security and Medicare entitlements.\n\nStill, a Democratic Congress would be hard-pressed to \"undo the major market-impactful legislation that has already been passed,\" UBS analysts note in a recent report. Many key regulations have been undone, and Mr. Trump retains the power to veto any Congressional legislation.\n\n\"With the economy already operating close to its full potential, and concerns mounting over further pro-cyclical fiscal measures, it's less important for Congress to be able to easily pass major legislation, including additional tax cuts that could further widen the deficit,\" UBS wrote. In that scenario, split-party control could be good for the markets, since it reduces the chance of any major legislation becoming law and unintentionally harming the economy.\n\nBut if gridlock reaches the levels it did in 2011, causing government shutdowns or another crisis over the debt ceiling, the opposite would likely happen. During the 2011 episode, when the U.S. Treasury came close to a technical default on its debt, the S&P 500 dropped by nearly 20 percent. A repeat of this scenario \"is not only possible but could actually become likely in an extreme gridlock environment,\" according to UBS.\n\nBetting on building\n\n\n\nInfrastructure \u2014 the catch-all phrase for big construction projects from highways and subways to water systems to the electric grid \u2014 may get a boost no matter what the election's outcome, according to UBS. That could come in the form of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill discussed by both sides in the 2016 Presidential contest, even as the deficit balloons over the next few years pay for the Republican-led tax cuts of 2017.\n\nBoth sides regularly say they want infrastructure progress. Vice President Mike Pence told The Hill this week the administration wants to push ahead with infrastructure during the lame-duck session following the election. While Mr. Trump's approach may be different from House Democrats' vision, the shared goal may leave room for a joint effort, Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told the New York Times.\n\nHouse minority leader Nancy Pelosi, in an interview last month with CNN and in a tweet, emphasized infrastructure as a priority for the Democrats. \"By and large, infrastructure has always been a bipartisan issue. We can create jobs by investing in new infrastructure projects like our water systems & broadband internet,\" she said in the tweet.\n\nInterest rates\n\n\n\nAny form of outsized federal spending would likely juice the economy even more by spurring investment and hiring. But it will have a downside: rising interest rates. Unless the Democrats can wrangle a partial repeal of last year's tax cuts or institute a new tax on wealthier Americans \u2014 possibilities Wall Street views as unlikely \u2014 further spending will have to be deficit-financed. Meanwhile, the deficit has tripled since 2007, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin recently surpassed his predecessor's record for the amount of of notes and bonds the government issues to fund its debt.\n\nThe amount of U.S. treasuries on the market by next year will be double the amount in 2017, according to Deutsche Bank's calculations. All that supply is likely to push interest rates even higher, said Slok. \"We see interest rates going up higher, partly as result of the economy doing well, partly as results of more treasuries and partly as a result of the Federal Reserve,\" he said.\n\nHigher interest rates are great for savers \u2014 but they can be a significant damper on business growth, since they make it more expensive to fund long-term investment. It also means that when interest rates shift even a little bit, there's \"there's a lot of treasuries behind that,\" said Slok. Already, the fastest-growing part of the federal budget is not new spending \u2014 it's interest payments on the public debt we've already incurred.", "Fans who are depressed over \"The Walking Dead\" star Andrew Lincoln's departure from the show can rejoice.

Screens Thurs., Nov. 8.\n\n\"Follow the money,\" they say \u2013 and there's certainly a lot of it in \"The Kleptocrats\" (World Premiere), in which investigative journalists from the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Hollywood Reporter track some of the $3.5 billion that was swindled or laundered from a Malaysian government fund (1MDB), which was then used to finance everything from yachts and Manhattan real estate to a Martin Scorsese movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Political scandals and greed all spill out in this engrossing tale (which is still unfolding; last week the Justice Department announced a guilty plea and indictments against two Goldman Sachs bankers and Malaysian businessman Jho Low in connection with the 1MDB scandal). Screens Friday, Nov. 9.\n\n\"Fire on the Hill: The Cowboys of South Central\" (New York City Premiere) tells the inspiring story of horsemen in inner-city Los Angeles who escape from gangs by riding, carrying on the traditions of black cowboys who have been pretty much invisible in the popular imagination of western lore. When the cowboys' stable, the Hill, is ravaged by fire, their displacement and effort to bring back the Hill becomes a unique story of urban renewal, with hay and oats. Director Brett Fallentine and DP Bradley Stonesifer both have great eyes for a story in which mythic western imagery collides with concrete, asphalt and steel. Screens Fri., Nov. 9, and Wed., Nov. 14. (Visit fireonthehill.la for more details.)\n\n\"Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin\" (New York City Premiere) \u2013 She was the grand dame of science fiction literature, though Le Guin, and her readers, would be the first to tell you her writing did not cater to a single genre, or to a preconceived notion of what science fiction is. This thoughtful up-close-and-personal documentary traces the life and career of Le Guin (who died last January), and her uncompromising willingness to speak out about the state of literature (and not just speculative fiction) in the era of Amazon. Screens Sat., Nov. 10. (Visit worldsofukl.com for details.)\n\n\"The Smartest Kids in the World\" (World Premiere) builds on the bestselling book by journalist Amanda Ripley, who explored differences in educational practices around the globe to understand why the U.S. had fallen behind so many countries. This engaging film follows four American high school students who travel to South Korea, the Netherlands, Finland and Switzerland to advance beyond what their schools in the States were giving them, and are tested in ways they never expected. Directed by Tracy Droz Tragos (an Emmy-winner for the doc \"Be Good, Smile Pretty\"). Screens Sunday, Nov. 11, and Tues., Nov. 13.\n\n\"Exit: Leaving Extremism Behind\" (New York City Premiere) is the powerful story of radicals who had been attracted to extremist and nationalist groups and then tried to break away, only to discover that, as with a mob family, it's not really an option. Filmmaker Karen Winther herself had joined a right wing group in Norway when she was a disaffected youth seeking a welcoming family. At first she was OK with the violence, but eventually decided to leave, and with no \"exit programs\" available for former group members, she had to depend on the kindness of a left wing extremist group member to escape. The film also shares the stories of people such as Angela, an American who sought to leave her white supremacist group behind after seeing images of a child victim of the Oklahoma City bombing; S\u00f8ren, a Dane who joined a militant anti-Fascist movement, who today teaches courses on radicalization; David, a Frenchman who was jailed for his participation in an Islamist terror group; and Manuel, a German who can no longer legitimize kicking people in the face now that he is the father of an adorable toddler. An immensely valuable work for anyone wanting to understand the mindset of extremism and the possibility of rehabilitation. Screens Sunday, Nov. 11. (A Women Make Movies release.)\n\nThe subject of \"Olympia\" (World Premiere) is Olympia Dukakis, the gifted stage and screen actress who, under the watchful eye of filmmaker Harry Mavromichalis, proves herself to be as outspoken and funny as some of her most colorful characters (such as her Oscar-winning portrayal of an Italian matriarch in \"Moonstruck\"). Mavromichalis follows Dukakis (whose youthful vigor puts the calendar to shame) as she recounts her career (including co-founding the Whole Theatre Company in Montclair, N.J.), accepts honors, meets fans in a supermarket, performs a one-woman show, visits her ancestral home on the Greek isle of Lesbos, and talks of the lineage of female power. A thoroughly captivating film, befitting its arresting star. Screens Sunday, Nov. 11. (Visit olympiathefilm.com for details.)\n\n\"Hillbilly\" (New York City Premiere) is one of the surprisingly few political documentaries in their year's festival, but it's perhaps the most pointed, on several levels. Co-director Ashley York, who grew up in eastern Kentucky before studying journalism in Los Angeles, returns to Appalachia to examine media misrepresentations of the region's people as ignorant, shoeless hicks, and the underlying class and racial divisions of those depictions. While such animus made her embarrassed about her background when trying to advance in her career (woe to whomever does not speak in the neutral, Midwest tones favored by broadcasters), York finds Appalachians proudly defiant about the views of outsiders, but overjoyed for the rare occasions (such as the film \"Coal Miner's Daughter\") when they're treated with dignity. York also seeks to understand why her family, Democrats for generations, had jumped on board the Trump train in the 2016 election, which can be partially explained by the very media and social characterizations of coal country residents that caused stark differences between Hillary Clinton's campaign and that of Donald Trump. Screens Mon., Nov. 12. (Visit http://hillbillymovie.com/ for details.)\n\nThere have been about 50,000 locals who served as interpreters for American military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Without them the Pentagon would have gotten nowhere. But such collaborations marked these men as traitors by ISIS and the Taliban, putting their lives in jeopardy. American lawmakers managed to pass special immigrant visas, to be granted to those who aided American troops, but bureaucracy has meant delays of years for permission to emigrate to the U.S. \"The Interpreters\" (New York City Premiere) follows several such men who are caught in limbo, trying to obtain a safe haven for their families, after risking their lives for a nation that, in the midst of a rancorous political campaign, looks increasingly less welcoming of them. Screens Mon., Nov. 12, and Tues., Nov. 13.\n\n\"Cracked Up\" (World Premiere) is the harrowing story of former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Darrell Hammond, whose addictions led him to rehab, and to the growing realization that he was suffering from a mental illness (more accurately, a \"mental injury\") derived from his tortured childhood at the hands of an abusive mother. Filmmaker Michelle Esrick tails Hammond, as he revisits the \"SNL\" studio where for years he shared his gift for impressions with a delighted audience; goes on a book tour and, later, performs a one-man show adapted from his memoir; and finally revisits his childhood home, the scene of the crimes. Hammond is surprisingly unguarded in front of the camera when talking about highly personal and painful memories, and his candor makes them all the more shocking and distressing. What is more incredible than having survived is that he did so with his sense of humor intact. Screens Wed., Nov. 14. (Visit crackedupmovie.com for details)\n\nWinner of the Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema - Documentary at this year's Sundance Film Festival, \"Of Fathers and Sons\" (New York City Premiere) is Syrian-born director Talal Derki's deep dive into the personal lives of radical Islamist fighters \u2013 men, he says, \"who long for war.\" Posing as a journalist sympathetic to their cause, Derki was able to gain incredible access to the homes of members of the Al-Nusra Front (one of the competing Islamist groups fighting Syrian government forces). Over the course of two years Derki followed these fathers as they shape their young children into prospective warriors. The disconnect between parental tenderness and cold-blooded training in military-style camps is jarring, while scenes of the kids playing amid the ordnance and ruins of battle are crushing.

Incidents ranged from offensive vandalism to assaults on religious leaders.\n\nThe New York Police Department's hate crime task force responded to 31 anti-Semitic hate crimes in the first 28 days of October compared to just 9 in the same period in 2017, according to Lieutenant John Grimpel, a spokesperson for the city's police department. The uptick in anti-Jewish crime in New York came in the weeks leading up the Oct. 27 Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, when 11 congregants of the Tree of Life synagogue were shot and killed in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history.\n\nSo far this year, crimes against the Jewish community have constituted half of all reported hate crimes in New York, up from 44 percent during the same time last year, according to data provided by the NYPD. Of the 290 reported hate crimes in New York in 2018 so far, 142 were deemed anti-Jewish, up from 126 during the same time period in 2017.\n\nChief of Detectives Dermot Shea said anti-Semitic incidents represented the \"vast majority\" of hate crimes. By comparison, hate crimes based on sexual orientation, the second-most frequently targeted hate crime category, accounted for 40 reported attacks during the same time frame, according to the NYPD.\n\nShea called the uptick a \"spike in anti-Semitic reported crimes\" during a press conference on Friday while addressing \"beyond disturbing\" vandalism at a Brooklyn synagogue. About three-quarters of the anti-Semitic hate crimes reported in New York so far in 2018 was vandalism involving swastikas.\n\nEvan Bernstein, the New York and New Jersey regional director for the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, said he's has been in contact \"near daily\" with New York's hate crimes task force.\n\n\"It's affecting people's daily lives,\" said Bernstein in a telephone interview with CBS News. \"We've never been busier.\"\n\nAnti-Semitic crime in New York as well as nationwide has been on a multi-year rise, Bernstein said. The Anti-Defamation League recorded 380 anti-Semitic incidents within New York state in 2017, a 90 percent increase from the year prior, according to Bernstein, who said he's expecting to report another increase in 2018.\n\nSo far this year, the Anti-Defamation League has recorded 12 assaults against members of the Jewish community in New York State, nine of which took place in Brooklyn, according to Bernstein. There were 11 in all of 2017.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge,\" Bernstein said. \"The community is very, very on edge about the sheer number of incidents taking place.\"\n\nSo far in New York City, all anti-Semitic crime, including vandalism and assault, is up 13 percent, according to NYPD data.\n\nDespite its strong Jewish community, anti-Semitic crime is more prevalent in New York than it is nationally, according to data from the FBI. In 2016, the most recent year available, anti-Semitic crimes made up 11.2 percent of all hate crimes recorded by the FBI. By comparison, race-related attacks accounted for 57.5 percent of reported hate crimes. Race-related attacks have made up 28 percent of all hate crimes in New York through October 28, according to the NYPD.", "A fifth grade class from Huntsville, Alabama, gathered in the cafeteria for a special event on Friday that left some of them crying tears of joy. One classmate, Kael Lancey, was especially shocked. The surprise was his mom, Sgt. Desiree Lancey, home from deployment. CBS Huntsville affiliate WHNT-TV was there to capture the heartwarming homecoming.\n\nThe class thought they were doing a history project on former NASA engineers. The school's namesake, Roger B. Chaffee, was an astronaut in the Apollo program, so the fifth graders believed the ruse. Little did they know, this gathering wasn't really about schoolwork.\n\nThe class was joined by the school's mascot, a larger-than-life bald eagle character, as they sang the national anthem. Then, at the end of the song, the eagle revealed who was really inside the eagle costume. It was Kael's mom.\n\nWhen Sgt. Lancey took off the eagle mask, her son's face immediately brightened. He ran from his group of classmates and into his mom's arms. Kael started crying tears of joy and so did some of his classmates. One boy was seen jumping up and down at the sight of Kael's mom.\n\nSgt. Lancey is in the Army and has been deployed in Kuwait for nearly a year. Kael hasn't seen his mom since last Christmas, so her return for this holiday season is extra special.\n\nWhen asked what it's like to have his mom back, he leaned over and gave her a hug. \"Lots of hugs all weekend right? OK, good,\" Sgt. Lancey told her son.\n\nWHNT-TV\n\n\"It's hard being in the military and being away from them so much, but seeing his face, just that initial [look] when I walked in and saw his face, I couldn't breathe and I was so excited. It's just bliss,\" the mom told WHNT-TV.\n\n\"My heart's been racing the whole time, I was so nervous to come and see you,\" Sgt. Lancey told Kael. He got to leave school early on Friday and spend some well-deserved time with his mom.\n\nIt's the end of Sgt. Lancey's third deployment and she doesn't have any others on the horizon. So for the foreseeable future, she'll have more time to focus on being a mom.", "NEW YORK \u2014 NBC and Fox News Channel both said Monday that they will stop airing President Trump's campaign advertisement that featured an immigrant convicted of murder. CNN had rejected the same ad, declaring it racist.\n\nFox pulled the ad Sunday \"upon further review,\" said Marianne Gambelli, president of the network's ad sales department. Fox did not immediately say how many times it aired on either Fox News Channel or the Fox Business Network.\n\nThe advertisement aired on NBC's \"Sunday Night Football\" and MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" and drew a heated online response. After reviewing the ad, NBC said it recognizes its insensitive nature.\n\nA source familiar with the matter told CBS News the ad was produced by the Trump campaign, with an ad buy of $1.5 million across TV and digital platforms.\n\nThe ad includes footage of Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported immigrant from Mexico sentenced to death in California for killing two police officers. It blames Democrats for allowing him into the country.\n\nThe ad, however, is not factual. It is akin to blaming Republicans for criminals who entered the country illegally under Presidents Trump or George W. Bush. There is no evidence that any Democrat \u2014 or anyone, for that matter \u2014 allowed Bracamontes to stay.\n\nDemocratic and Republican administrations alike have deported hundreds of thousands of people a year. Former President Barack Obama focused during his second term on recent arrivals and people with criminal histories, but Mr. Trump quickly directed that anyone in the country illegally could be targeted.\n\nFacebook also announced Monday that the ad violated its advertising policy. \"While the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook, it cannot receive paid distribution,\" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMr. Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, tweeted that NBC News, CNN and Facebook had chosen \"to stand with those ILLEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY.\" He said the media was trying to control what you see and think. Parscale made no mention of Fox's decision.\n\nThe president's son, Donald Trump Jr., tweeted over the weekend, noting CNN's refusal to air the advertisement, saying, \"I guess they only run fake news and won't talk about real threats that don't suit their agenda.\"\n\nCNN said it was made \"abundantly clear\" through its coverage that the ad was racist and declined to air it when the campaign sought to buy airtime.", "Election Day is poised to bring heavy rain, strong wind gusts and even potential tornadoes to various states across the U.S. where voters will be casting their ballots in competitive races. In the South, severe weather threats are forecast in northern Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams is vying to become the nation's first female African-American governor in a high-profile race against the state's GOP Secretary of State Brian Kemp.\n\nFurther south, pop-up thunderstorms may strike the three south Florida congressional districts where Republicans are defending against well-funded challenges by Democrats. Florida voters will also be choosing between Democrat Andrew Gillum or Republican Ron DeSantis as their next governor and between Sen. Bill Nelson and Governor Rick Scott for the Senate seat.\n\nThere's also a risk of flash floods between New York and northern New England, a region hosting multiple gubernatorial elections and some tight House contests, including the race between Democrat Antonio Delgado and Republican Rep. John Faso in New York's Hudson Valley, and the Staten Island clash between GOP Rep. Dan Donovan and progressive challenger, Max Rose.\n\nPennsylvania is looking at heavy rain in the morning and early afternoon. Democrats hope to pick up some seats in the state's new court-ordered congressional district map \u2014 particularly in the suburbs around Philadelphia. Severe rain is in the forecast in New Jersey, too, where Democrats are seeking to flip several Republican-held suburban districts while helping Sen. Bob Menendez avoid a humiliating upset.\n\nCBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto points out that historically, while weather has depressed turnout in races that are not competitive, it has not been a factor in competitive races.

West opted for the cash option, which will pay her an immediate $198.1 million, minus taxes.\n\nOne of West's sisters had to send West a picture of her winning ticket because she had left it in her sister's truck.

Ultimately, Cole would suffer paralysis and permanent brain damage, and three officers would lose their jobs.\n\nThe officers lied about Cole's condition in statements and interviews, a Bedfordshire police panel found, resulting in their dismissals in October -- more than five years after the incident.\n\nWhile the panel's ruling brings some measure of relief for Cole's family, they say they still haven't received answers to their most pressing questions: how was their son paralyzed, who is responsible and how will they be held accountable?\n\n\"We are happy some of the lies have been exposed but our focus has always been to find out who injured Julian and to bring them to justice,\" the Cole family said in a statement to CBS News. \"We won't stop... until they have had to answer for what they did in a criminal court.\"\n\nCole Family\n\nThis case has some parallels to the death of Freddie Gray, who died after being arrested by the Baltimore Police Department -- something that is not lost on mother Claudia Cole.\n\n\"When I saw the photograph of Freddie Gray lying in hospital, I thought, \"That is Julian, that is my son,\" she said in a statement read outside the U.S. embassy in 2015, shortly after Gray's death. \"I felt sick to my stomach as it brought back so many memories of first seeing Julian in hospital.\"\n\nToday is 2nd anniversary of what happened to Julian.

The Cole family requested a review of the evidence in 2017 and CPS reached the same conclusion a year later.\n\nCole, then 19, went out to the Elements nightclub with friends on May 5, 2013. He was later was escorted out, according to the BBC. After being denied a refund, he tried to get back inside the club multiple times and police were called.\n\nA bouncer tackled Cole to the ground. Cole stood back up, according to the panel's final report and was allegedly acting in \"an aggressive manner.\" He was then taken \"to the ground again\" by three police officers \u2014 Ross, Oates and Kalyan \u2014 and handcuffed.\n\nThe officers escorted Cole to the police van, where the panel notes he was complaining of neck pain. They then transported Cole to Greyfriars police station, and he was found not breathing.\n\nRoss called an ambulance and paramedics administered CPR. He was taken to the hospital, where it was determined he had a spinal cord injury, then went into cardiac arrest.\n\nIn her records, Ross wrote Cole complained about his neck and she asked whether he could move his legs. The records make no mention about the tackle by the bouncer, which she later told investigators \"shocked\" her.\n\nThe panel found that Ross' account of that night was \"totally unconvincing.\" They surmised that if she was truly shocked by the takedown, there would be a mention in her records as to the reason why she asked Cole to move his legs.\n\nKaylan was also found to have lied when he stated that he heard Ross ask Cole if he could move his legs, and that he moved them in response, according to the panel's report.\n\nOates also claimed that Cole walked to the police van during his arrest, which the panel says he knew was not true.\n\nThe panel cleared Ross of accusations that she used excessive force when she handcuffed Cole.\n\nThe panel contends the three \"did not ask any basic questions concerning his welfare.\" However, the panel added this was \"unlikely to have changed the outcome.\"\n\nThe Cole family says the hearing was never about the cause of his injuries. Family attorney Rachel Harger said in an emailed statement the panel's findings are inconclusive on how he was paralyzed and said they would call on the IOPC to re-open their investigation.\n\n\"There is no closure for us and there is no question of justice until we at least know the truth about what happened,\" Claudia wrote in 2015.\n\nThree years later, the family says, those questions remain unanswered.", "Tuesday is Election Day. Here's how you can follow the results, understand the stakes, and know which races CBS News is looking at.\n\nThe Stakes\n\nTuesday is Democrats' last, best chance to stifle President Trump's agenda before he completes his first term. At stake is control of the House and Senate, not to mention numerous statewide races, including a number of crucial governorships.\n\nDemocrats are likely to win the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2010. Under President Obama, the GOP used the chamber to investigate the White House and block Democratic priorities. Now Democrats are hoping to return the favor by flipping seats in the suburbs and some GOP-dominated rural areas.\n\nShould Democrats win one or both chambers of Congress, it will be exceedingly difficult for Mr. Trump and the Republicans to pass major legislative priorities.\n\nOn the other hand, if Republicans maintain control of the House and Senate, they will have bucked history and delivered a major blow to the Democratic Party. The party in the White House very rarely keeps control of Congress in the first midterm after a presidential election; the last time it happened was 2002, when President George W. Bush was still massively popular in the wake on the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Polls\n\nIt may not be easy for Democrats to take the House majority, since they will have to win a string of districts in Republican territory and get strong turnout, but they head into Tuesday in position to do so \u2014 even if narrowly. CBS News' current estimate is for Democrats to win 225 seats -- just beyond the 218 needed for a majority -- while Republicans win 210.\n\nHowever, there is a margin of error of plus-or-minus 13 seats on each, keeping the possibility open that Republicans retain control.\n\nThe House\n\nDemocrats need to win a net total of 23 seats to retake the House of Representatives.\n\nA Democratic House would likely launch numerous investigations into Mr. Trump and his associates, and might even explore impeachment proceedings down the line. A Democratic House would also present a major roadblock to the administration's domestic agenda, likely blocking big-ticket items like Mr. Trump's proposed border wall and any attempts to privatize federal programs.\n\nThe Senate\n\nThe GOP currently has 51 Senate seats compared to the Democrats' 49. But despite that slim Republican majority, 10 Democratic senators are fighting for reelection in states Mr. Trump won in 2016, meaning the odds are stacked in favor of the GOP.\n\nStill, Democrats have a narrow chance of taking the U.S. Senate, which would potentially give them complete control of Congress if they take the House as well. Such a result could bring the government to a standstill \u2013 or it might drag Mr. Trump, an avowed fan of big deals, to the middle if he looks for common ground.\n\nBig races to watch on CBSNews.com\n\nRepublican Sen.

On Friday night, after an alleged attempt to tranquilize the animal, a bullet from the gun of a controversial hunter killed the big cat.\n\nThe 6-year-old tigress, officially named T1 but dubbed \"Avni\" (which means Earth in Hindi) by conservationists, was linked to at least 13 human deaths over the last two years. But the killing of what is a revered and protected animal in India, and the fate of her two 10-month-old cubs, has become a huge controversy.\n\nAvni's latest victims were three people in the Yavatmal district of Maharashtra state. Thousands of people in about 20 villages around the forest had lived in a state of fear for months. Government advisories warning local residents to return early from the fields every day and not to venture out alone had crippled daily life.\n\nUnder pressure from locals to kill the tigress, the state's forestry authorities issued a \"shoot on sight\" order in early September against the tigress. That order was challenged in the courts and eventually reached India's Supreme Court. The top court declined to overturn the shooting order, but said an attempt must first be made to tranquilize the tigress.\n\nTigress lured and killed by controversial hunter\n\nTigers are an endangered species, protected under Indian law. They can be killed only if a state government determines the animal is dangerous to human life. Maharashstra state's forestry department branding Avni a man-eater cleared the way for a hunt.\n\nOn Friday, a patrol team lured Avni using as bait a live goat, the urine of another tigress, and a Calvin Klein perfume that contains a pheromone shown draw big cats. The perfume includes the pheromone civetone, which comes from the scent glands of the cat-like civet. As CBS News partner network BBC News reported, an experiment at New York's Bronx Zoo showed that jaguars were drawn to the perfume.\n\nAccording to a government statement, when a forest patrol team spotted the tigress, a tranquilliser dart was first fired at the animal. But the statement says the tigress charged at the patrol's vehicle, forcing sharpshooter Asghar Ali Khan to kill it in \"self-defence.\"\n\nAsghar Ali Khan told the India Today news outlet that just as his \"tranquilizer dart hit her, she charged at our open vehicle and to save life I had to shoot her.\"\n\nActivists say killing broke the rules\n\nActivists have challenged that official narrative, however, questioning whether there was really any effort to tranquilize the animal before it was shot. Wildlife activist Dr. Jerryl Banait, who had petitioned the Supreme Court against the hunting order, claims there was no such effort, and that the operation was not carried out according to the rules.\n\n\"Avni's killing must be investigated as there are clear violations of Standard Operating Procedures,\" Neha Sinha, another wildlife conservationist, told CBS News. \"There were no veterinarians or representatives of the state in the hunting team as required by the rules.\"\n\nIndia Today Group\n\nQuestions are also being raised as to why the government brought in controversial big game hunters Ali Khan and his father Shafat Ali Khan.\n\n\"Shafat Ali Khan has killed three tigers, at least 10 leopards, a few elephants and 300 wild boar in Chandrapur, Maharashtra. He is a criminal known for supplying guns to anti-nationals and for a suspected case of murder in Hyderabad,\" Maneka Gandhi, a government minister and known animal rights activist, said on Twitter.\n\nHis son was not authorised to kill. This is patently illegal. Despite the forest officials being committed to tranquilise, capture and qurantine the tigress, the trigger-happy shooter has killed her on his own under orders of Sh @SMungantiwar. \u2014 Maneka Gandhi (@Manekagandhibjp) November 4, 2018\n\nCalling it a \"ghastly murder,\" Gandhi added that the younger Ali Khan \"was not authorized to kill. This is patently illegal. Despite the forest officials being committed to tranquilize, capture and quarantine the tigress, the trigger-happy shooter has killed her on his own.\"\n\nEven the darting of a wild animal is prohibited at night, between sunset and sunrise, according to rules established by India's National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).\n\nPETA India has called for investigation into what it's calling a \"wildlife crime.\" In a statement, the organization said, \"Avni was killed illegally, satisfying a hunter's lust for blood ... (in an) apparent violation of the Wildlife Protection Act and the guidelines of National Tiger Conservation Authority.\"\n\n\"The whole hunting operation was shrouded in secrecy. There were protests already going on; the government should have been extra careful, yet they seem to have done it in a very non-transparent manner,\" conservationist Neha Sinha told CBS News.\n\nIndia is home to 60 percent of the world's tiger population. A 2014 census put India's tiger population at 2,226, down from around 40,000 in the 1940s. The last couple of decades have seen the population increase due to protection laws.\n\nWhile some of the villagers in Maharashtra's Yavatmal district celebrated Avni's death with firecrackers, the forest officials are out on a new mission: to try to find Avni's two young cubs, and save them.", "", "", "MCALLEN, Texas \u2014 Federal authorities have awarded a $145 million contract to a Texas company to build 6 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said Friday that SLSCO will begin construction of an 18-foot reinforced concrete levee wall in February in the agency's McAllen Station region. The company will also increase the height of existing fences.\n\nIt will be the first section of President Trump's border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.\n\nThe government recently completed construction of a 2-mile, 30-foot tall section of fencing along the border in California.\n\nMr. Trump has been ramping up anti-immigration rhetoric heading into Tuesday's midterm elections and has ordered troops to the border to meet a caravan of Central American migrants slowly traveling through Mexico.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Mr. Trump's plan to send troops to the southern border, dismissing criticism that the move is motivated by politics ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\"We've made clear to them they need to undertake every effort they can to stop this illegal migration from entering the United States, and the president's made very clear they will not be permitted to enter our country unlawfully,\" Pompeo said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\n\nHe disputed that Mr. Trump's emphasis on hardening his immigration policies in recent weeks was aimed at rallying his base.\n\n\"I've been involved in scores of conversations about stopping illegal immigration from Mexico and never once has there been a discussion of the political impact in U.S. domestic politics,\" Pompeo said. \"It has always been about securing the safety of the American people and securing our southern border.\"", "YAOUNDE, Cameroon -- Armed separatists have kidnapped at least 78 students and their principal from a Presbyterian school in Cameroon, officials said Monday. A governor said the abductions occurred late Sunday in Nkwen village in Cameroon's restive northwest region. The kidnappers struck near Bamenda, the capital of the troubled English-speaking region, according to Governor Deben Tchoffo.\n\nA video purportedly of the kidnapped children has been released on social media via men who call themselves Amba boys, a reference to the state of Ambazonia which armed separatists are trying to establish in Cameroon's northwest and southwest regions.\n\nIn the video, the kidnappers force several of the young male students to give their names and the names of their parents. The children say they were kidnapped late Sunday by the Amba boys, and they don't know where they are being held.\n\nThe men who identify themselves as the kidnappers say they will only release the children when they achieve what they want.\n\n\"We shall only release you after the struggle. You will be going to school now here,\" say the men who identified themselves as Amba boys. While the video could not be independently verified, parents have been reacting on social media saying they recognize their children in the video.\n\nHundreds have been killed in Cameroon's Anglophone regions in the past year, where violence between armed separatists and the military has increased since a government crackdown against protesters in the northwest and southwest regions, who claim that as the English-speaking minority they are marginalized by the French-speaking government.\n\nLast week separatist militants attacked workers on a state-run rubber plantation in restive southwestern Cameroon, chopping off their fingers because the men had defied an order to stay away from the farms.\n\nAn American missionary also died in the northwest region around Bamenda after he was shot in the head amid fighting between armed separatists and soldiers.\n\nThe turmoil in Cameroon comes as President Paul Biya, who has held his office since 1982, easily won a seventh term last month in an election that the United States says was marked by irregularities. The government did away with presidential term limits several years ago, part of a trend in Africa that has dismayed many.", "NEW YORK -- Security was tight Monday as jury selection started in the federal trial of notorious accused drug kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman in New York City. Special security procedures are also expected to be in place for jurors, once they are seated, CBS New York reports.\n\nGuzman is accused of having a hand in dozens of murders, of using his drug cartel to smuggle more than 200 tons of cocaine into the United States, even pulling off running the massive operation from behind bars. That's when he wasn't busy escaping from jail \u2014 twice.\n\nThe almost-mythical criminal pedigree of the Mexican drug lord, who was extradited in 2017 to face U.S. drug conspiracy charges, has sparked security concerns for the trial that at times have drawn as much attention as the case's sensational allegations.\n\nA look at those concerns:\n\nWitnesses in the crosshairs\n\nProsecutors say Guzman was in the habit of ordering the killings of anyone who got in his way during his heyday in Mexico as boss of the Sinaloa cartel.\n\nCourtesy of Jane Rosenberg\n\nIn his way now is a lineup of government witnesses who survived the wave of violence and are expected to give details about the ruthless way he kept power for 20 years in the cutthroat world of international drug trafficking. The defense says the witnesses are the true bad guys whose testimony shouldn't be trusted.\n\nThe names of the witnesses have been blacked out on court documents with prosecutors saying their identities need to be protected because their cooperation could put them in the crosshairs of a vengeful cartel. According to court papers, some are being held in special jail units for their protection, while others are in witness protection programs.\n\nThe list of people who could turn up on the witness stand is long. Two standout possibilities are twin brothers Pedro and Margarito Flores, former Chicago-based narcotics wholesalers who did business with Guzman before their arrest in 2008. They agreed to cooperate and record phone conversations with Guzman about the size of shipments smuggled on boats and airplanes.\n\nIn one, a voice identified as Guzman's asks, \"How much can you get rid of in a month?\"\n\nThe now imprisoned brothers paid a steep price for flipping: Prosecutors say in 2009 their father was murdered in Mexico by a cartel hit team.\n\nFortifying the courthouse\n\nThe Eastern District of New York federal court in Brooklyn is taking unprecedented measures to protect the potential jurors with police and U.S. marshals are stationed outside the courthouse, the station reports.\n\nReuters/Henry Romero\n\nThe judge also agreed with prosecutors that the jury for the case should be kept anonymous, a measure typical in terrorism or mob cases where jury intimidation is a concern.\n\nNo one's hiding the ominous nature of the case from potential jurors. Questions for them on an initial screening form ask if they've ever heard of \"El Chapo\" along with, \"Have you, or has anyone close to you, ever felt fearful of or threatened by people who you thought were associated with drug crimes?\"\n\nJurors also will be escorted to and from the courthouse by federal officers and sequestered from the public while inside. As a reason, the judge cited prosecutors' contention that Guzman's cartel \"employs 'sicarios,' or hit men, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults and kidnappings.\"\n\nGuzman's defense attorneys have argued the level of security creates a public spectacle that's prejudicial to jurors, CBS New York reports.\n\nKeeping an eye on El Chapo\n\nAfter Guzman was brought to New York, authorities here decided he should be housed in solitary confinement in a high-security wing of a federal jail in Manhattan that has held notorious terrorists and mobsters.\n\nCentral to that calculation was Guzman's history of giving directions to his lieutenants from Mexican jails and credentials as a two-time escapee there. The second time was via a mile-long tunnel dug to the shower in his cell.\n\nThe logistical problem for his keepers: The case is being prosecuted across the East River in federal court in Brooklyn. Before dawn Monday, the 61-year-old was driven in a heavily armed motorcade from a Manhattan correction facility to Brooklyn, shutting down part of the Brooklyn Bridge, as was the procedure during pre-trial hearings, CBS New York reported.\n\nThe judge indicated he thinks the time and expense involved with the transport would add up to a logistical nightmare \u2014 and an inconvenience for New Yorkers who rely on the bridge to commute \u2014 for a trial expected to last as long as four months. He said there would be adjustments, but didn't elaborate.\n\nGuzman has pleaded not guilty to international drug trafficking, money laundering, kidnapping and murder. If convicted, he faces life behind bars. Opening statements are likely to begin Nov. 13.", "The U.S. is moving to hit Iran economically with what U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin calls a \"maximum pressure\" campaign against the country's energy and banking sectors.\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday said it is re-imposing sanctions on the Iranian regime's energy, shipping and financial sectors, targeting over 700 entities. Many of these companies initially were targeted by sanctions under President Barack Obama, but the restrictions were subsequently lifted when the U.S. struck a deal with Iran in 2015 over its nuclear ambitions. Three hundred of the entities are new targets.\n\nIn a press conference with Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Mnuchin said the sanctions are Treasury's \"largest single-day action ever targeting Iran.\" The Trump administration is providing waivers to eight countries, allowing them to continue to import oil from Iran, which Pompeo said was necessary \"to ensure a well-supplied oil market.\"\n\nThe countries receiving waivers are China, Greece, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, and will be able to continue to purchase Iranian oil as long as they work to reduce imports to zero.\n\nThe sanctions target Iran's energy, financial and shipping sectors and are aimed at damaging the country's economy following President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. The measures taking effect Monday restore all the sanctions that had previously been lifted under the accord, which had given Iran billions of dollars in sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.\n\nMr. Trump said Monday that the measures are the \"toughest sanctions ever imposed\" on Iran, telling reporters at Joint Base Andrews that Iranian oil prices can go \"down to zero.\"\n\n\"The Iranian regime has a choice: It can either do a 180-degree turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country, or it can see its economy crumble,\" Pompeo said at the press conference.\n\nThe sanctions target 50 Iranian banks and their foreign and domestic subsidiaries, as well as more than 200 people and vessels in Iran's shipping and energy sectors, Treasury said in a statement. It also covers an Iranian airline, Iran Air, and more than 65 of its aircraft.\n\n\"We are intent on making sure the Iranian regime stops siphoning its hard currency reserves into corrupt investments and the hands of terrorists,\" Mnuchin said in a statement.\n\n-- With reporting from the Associated Press.", "British Airways passengers bound for the U.K. lived through a \"journey of hell\" after being stuck in the U.S. for three days, many of them documenting their ire against the airline on social media. The trip originated in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday evening, but following a myriad of issues and a detour to New York, they finally arrived in London Gatwick airport Sunday.\n\nThe airline said in a statement to CBS News that BA Flight 2036 had \"minor technical issue,\" which forced the plane to sit on a runway for hours Thursday before it was ultimately canceled, leaving passengers to stay at a hotel overnight followed by an entire day of waiting Friday.\n\nThe flight to London Gatwick didn't leave until Saturday early morning \u2014 and shortly after takeoff, it was diverted to New York as a \"precaution,\" a British Airways spokesperson said. According to BA, a relief aircraft was sent to New York to get customers back on their way to London as \"quickly as possible.\" Customers who were supposed to leave on Thursday at 7:25 p.m. didn't finally land in London until Sunday at 6:49 a.m.\n\nDuring the three-day ordeal, passengers on social media unleashed their fury on the airline, as many complained about lack of communication and overall, \"disgusting\" customer service.\n\nFinally back at LGW after the worst 3 days.

The term is called \"overbiffing\" because the scammers overstate a person's \"balance in full,\" which is sometimes shortened to BIF.\n\nSlapping a temporary restraining order on a half-dozen companies affiliated with a Buffalo debt collector named Robert Heidenreich, also known as \"Bobby Rich,\" regulators maintain that Heindenreich's bill collectors chronicled just how much they \"overbiffed\" by using forms showing the actual balance due as well as the inflated amount that they told consumers was owed.\n\nIn many cases, this false \"balance given\" was hundreds, even thousands, of dollars more than the consumer actually owed.\n\n\"This is really egregious,\" says John Heath, directing attorney at Lexington Law, a credit repair firm. \"Unfortunately this is something that happened enough that the FTC had to involve itself in filing an action.\"\n\nIn addition to artificially inflating debt balances, Heidenreich directed his employees to mislead debtors about who was calling \u2014 encouraging his debt collectors to pose as lawyers or members of law enforcement, according to complaints filed by the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General's office.\n\nThe debt collectors would warn the consumer had committed a crime and was about to be arrested, sued or served with legal papers because of a failure to pay an alleged debt. When the frantic consumer would ask how to stop the legal proceedings, the debt collectors would direct them to \"attorneys\" \u2014 actually just additional debt collectors \u2014 who would allow them to pay over the phone with a debit card.\n\nWhen consumers balked at paying the bill, the debt collectors turned abusive, according to the complaint, engaging in threatening expletive-filled rants, sometimes threatening to call the debtor's employer or relatives.\n\nHeidenreich's attorney failed to return calls for comment.\n\nIllegal behavior\n\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act prohibits all of these actions. Debt collectors are not allowed to use abusive language, or contact anyone other than the debtor in their attempt to collect. Misrepresenting who collectors are, lying about the consequences of not repaying a debt and fabricating debt amounts are also prohibited under FDCPA, as well as other fraud statutes.\n\nAnyone who is contacted by a debt collector has the right to demand that the collector \"validate\" the debt in writing, showing how much is owed and to whom. Consumers should be able to verify these numbers against the numbers on their own credit reports, which they can get for free at www.annualcreditreport.com.\n\nIf a debt collector is abusive or is harassing you with multiple phone calls, you also have the right to bar them from further telephone communication, says Heath. The collector would then be forced to only contact you in writing.\n\nIf a collector violates these rules, you can report the abuse to your state attorney general's consumer affairs division or to the FTC.\n\nA federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Heidenreich and his companies and employees on Thursday, barring them from further violations of the law, as well as from destroying documents or moving company assets.", "NEW YORK \u2014 Never mind the critics. \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" starring Rami Malek as late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, shrugged off production troubles and mediocre reviews to debut with $50 million in weekend ticket sales in U.S. and Canada, and another $72.5 million internationally, according to studio estimates Sunday. That was well beyond expectations, which had pegged the film closer to $35-40 million in its opening weekend. \"Rhapsody\" currently holds only a 60 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nBut audiences rushed to theaters to see the widely praised performance by Malek, the \"Mr. Robot\" star, and to hear Queen's foot-stomping anthems like \"We are the Champions,\" \u2033Another One Bites the Dust\" and the operatic title song. The movie, which Bryan Singer directed before being replaced by Dexter Fletcher, at times has an almost concert-like feel, including a lengthy re-creation of the band's 1985 Live Aid performance. Singer admitted that he and Malek initially clashed, but later claimed that that they got past their differences. When a report stated that Singer was being \"unprofessional\" and had been absent from the set during filming, he responded that he had to return to the U.S. to deal with \"pressing health matters\" concerning one of his parents, leading to his firing.\n\nIn soaring to No. 1, the Fox release trounced one from Disney, which will soon own the studio. The Walt Disney Co.'s lavish, big-budget \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms\" opened with just $20 million, despite a production budget of $125 million. Disney is set to merge with Fox in the coming months, effectively ending the 103-year-old Fox, one of Hollywood's six major studios.\n\n\"We were hoping for a stronger start, but we do think it's a film that people will find as we head into the holidays,\" said Cathleen Taff, head of theatrical distribution for Disney.\n\nThough Disney's record of success is the envy of Hollywood, \"The Nutcracker and the Four Realms\" marks the studio's third misfire this year following the underperforming \"A Wrinkle in Time\" and \"Solo.\" The studio's CGI-stuffed resurrection of E.T.A. Hoffmann story was positioned as an early holiday season release, but flopped with critics (34 percent \"fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes) and sparked only modest interest from audiences. It grossed $38.5 million overseas.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" made for $52 million, was largely dismissed by critics as an overly conventional rock biopic. But the film proved more popular with moviegoers, who gave the PG-13 release an \"A\" CinemaScore and 4 1/2 stars out of five on Comscore's PostTrak audience survey.\n\n\"Even in the negativity that came out of critics, there was always a 'but,' almost universally: 'But Rami is great,'\" noted Aronson. \"I'm very happy for [producer] Graham [King] and Rami and the entire filmmaking team. And I'm happy for the home team. This is a big win for Fox.\"\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, praised Fox's rollout of the film as \"pitch perfect.\" Dergarabedian also cited Malek's breakout big-screen performance and the sustained interest in all things musical at the box office. Musically based films have lately been major draws in theaters, from Fox's own \"The Greatest Showman\" earlier in the year to Warner Bros.' Oscar favorite \"A Star Is Born,\" which collected another $11.1 million in its fifth weekend for $165.6 million overall.\n\n\"It seems that audiences can't get enough of movies that have music baked into their DNA,\" Dergarabedian said. \"That's proving to be a very successful formula.\"\n\nAnother winning formula \u2014 Tiffany Haddish plus anything \u2014 came up short over the weekend.\n\n\"Nobody's Fool,\" which paired Haddish with another box-office force in writer-director-producer Tyler Perry, opened in third with a so-so $14 million. While far from disastrous for a movie that cost $19 million to make, the muted performance of \"Nobody's Fool\" seemed likely a result of oversaturation. Two films starring Haddish \u2014 \"Night School\" and \"The Oath\" \u2014 have opened in the past six weeks, and \"Night School\" is still No. 12 at the box office.\n\nIn limited release, Joel Edgerton's acclaimed gay conversion therapy drama \"Boy Erased,\" starring Lucas Hedges, opened with a strong per-theater average of $44,000 in five theaters.\n\nMatthew Heineman's \"A Private War,\" starring Rosamund Pike as war correspondent Marie Colvin, opened in four theaters with a per-theater average of $18,000.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore.

But in opening a high-profile import expo in Shanghai he provided no response to U.S. and European complaints about technology policy and curbs on foreign business.\n\nThe China International Import Expo is part of official efforts to defuse trade tension while resisting pressure to roll back industry plans that Washington, Europe, Japan and other governments say violate its market-opening obligations.\n\n\"It is our sincere commitment to open the Chinese market,\" Xi said in a speech to a VIP audience that included Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Xi promised to \"stimulate the potential to increase imports,\" including by cutting costs for importers and improving consumer spending power.\n\nXi also took swipes at President Donald Trump, although he didn't mention the U.S. president by name, according to Bloomberg News. Xi denounced the \"law of the jungle\" and \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" trade policies, the publication reported.\n\nSome 3,600 companies from 152 countries selling everything from Egyptian dates to German factory machinery are attending the five-day event at a Shanghai convention center that bills itself as one of the world's biggest buildings.\n\nFew specifics\n\nBusiness groups complain that while Beijing is expanding imports to serve its manufacturers and consumers, it blocks access to industries including finance and logistics. They say regulators are trying to squeeze foreign competitors out of promising fields such as information security.\n\nXi gave \"few specific solutions that address the concerns of the foreign business community,\" Kenneth Jarrett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, said in an email.\n\nJarrett noted that Xi promised better protection of foreign patents and other intellectual property, which companies complain are copied or improperly used by Chinese rivals. But he said companies need to see enforcement \"before we know if this commitment is real.\"\n\nPrime ministers and other senior officials of governments including Egypt, Hungary, Pakistan and Vietnam also were attending the fair.\n\nThe United States \u2014 China's biggest trading partner \u2014 had no plans to send a high-level envoy.\n\nThe expo is \"likely not a huge benefit or attraction for U.S. companies,\" said the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, William Zarit, in an email.\n\nAly Song / Reuters\n\n\"Many may be attending because they think it is politically smart,\" said Zarit. \"However, unless some of the protectionist trade barriers currently in place are changed, it won't make much difference either way.\"\n\nXi made no mention of Beijing's fight with Mr. Trump over Chinese plans for state-led development of technology industries. But in an indirect reference to Mr. Trump's \"America first\" policies and threats of import controls, he appealed to other governments to \"jointly safeguard free trade.\"\n\nMade in China 2025\n\nChina has cut tariffs and announced other measures this year to boost imports, which rose 15.9 percent in 2017 to $1.8 trillion. But none addresses U.S. complaints that prompted Mr. Trump to impose penalty tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese imports. Beijing has responded with tariff hikes on $110 billion of American goods.\n\nChinese leaders have rejected pressure to roll back plans such as \"Made in China 2025,\" which calls for state-led creation of global champions in robotics and other fields.\n\nLast week, Mr. Trump and Xi had what China's foreign ministry called an \"extremely positive\" phone conversation. They plan to meet during this month's Group of 20 gathering of major economist in Argentina, but private sector analysts say a breakthrough is unlikely.\n\nThe fight has added to challenges for communist leaders are who trying to shore up economic growth that slumped to a post-global crisis low of 6.5 percent over a year earlier in the three months ending in September. They also are struggling to revive confidence in a stock market that has tumbled 25 percent this year to become the world's worst performer.\n\nXi acknowledged some Chinese industries face \"growing risks\" but said efforts to shore up growth are already paying off. He said China's $12 trillion-a-year economy is \"a sea, not a small pond\" and can withstand shocks.\n\n\"A storm can overturn a small pond, but not a sea,\" he said. \"After more than 5,000 years of hardship, China is still here. Facing the future, China will always be here.\"\n\nThe expo fits in with Beijing's quest to develop a trading network centered on China and increase its influence in a Western-dominated global system.\n\nChina already is the No. 1 market for its Asian neighbors and is promoting its multibillion-dollar \"Belt and Road\" initiative to expand commerce by building ports, railways and other infrastructure across 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Europe and Africa.\n\nThe fair lets Beijing show it is \"making efforts to boost imports,\" said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Markit. But it is \"unlikely to have much impact\" on its politically sensitive trade balance with the United States.\n\nA deal with Washington \"will require significant measures by the Chinese authorities to reduce bilateral trade imbalances and to protect U.S. intellectual property rights,\" Biswas said.\n\nEurope, Japan and other trading partners have criticized Mr. Trump's tactics but echo U.S. complaints. European leaders are frustrated that Beijing bars foreign acquisitions of most Chinese assets while its own companies are on a global buying spree.\n\nLast week, the French and German ambassadors to Beijing appealed for changes including an end to requirements that foreign companies operate in joint ventures with state-owned partners.\n\nThe Shanghai expo also gives Beijing a chance to repair its image as a positive for global development following complaints \"Belt and Road\" leaves host countries with too much debt, while too little work goes to local companies.\n\nGovernments including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand have scrapped or scaled back projects.

An attorney named David Cross, who represents election security advocates, on Saturday contacted the secretary of state's office and the FBI to alert them to what he deemed a \"serious vulnerability\" in the voter registration system that potentially made information about individual voters accessible. He said that a private citizen had pointed out the flaw in the system, according to the Associated Press, which noted that the flaw would enable anyone who had access to a voter's personal information to change the voter's record.\n\nThe citizen, according to the AP also told the Georgia Democratic Party about the vulnerability, and its voter protection director, Sara Tindall Ghazal, contacted two computer security officials. \"If this report is accurate, it is a massive vulnerability,\" wrote Tindall Ghazal, according to the AP.\n\nAbrams accused Kemp's office of being slow to take any action on the alleged security flaw, which it had learned about Saturday but did not take action until Sunday. \"He failed to act,\" she said. The secretary of state's office has referred the matter to the FBI. Abrams said she has not yet been contacted by the bureau. The state Democratic Party has denied any involvement, saying that the \"scurrilous claims\" are \"100 percent false.\" Abrams called the accusation another example of Kemp's \"pattern of voter suppression.\"\n\nKemp was invited on \"CBS This Morning\" and declined to appear.\n\nIn a subsequent statement Sunday afternoon, the secretary of state's office said the investigation was prompted by \"information from our legal team about failed efforts to breach the online voter registration system and My Voter Page.\" It said it had referred the matter to the FBI and \"will release more information as it becomes available.\"\n\nAt at rally with President Trump on Sunday, Kemp did not reference the allegation, instead criticizing Abrams as part of the \"radical left\" who is seeking to make Georgia as liberal as California. \"They are energized, they are mobilized,\" he said Sunday.\n\nThe Georgia race is one of the most closely watched in tomorrow's midterm contests.

Gary Herbert said.\n\nTaylor's best friend Toby Mileski said his children have lost a role model and the country has lost a hero.\n\n\"He did what he did because he wanted to make sure there were no injustices,\" Mileski said.\n\nTaylor is being remembered as a man who wanted to make the world a better place.\n\nCity administrator Jon Call worked with him. \"My heart bleeds for those kids. I just can't imagine what they're going to go through,\" Call said.\n\nLess than a week before his death, Taylor wrote what would be his final post on Facebook. He urged all Americans to vote regardless of party, saying it's important to remember that as Americans, we have far more that unites us than divides us.", "MULTAN, Pakistan -- The husband of a Christian woman acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy, but not released after countrywide protests, appealed on Sunday to U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May to help the family leave Pakistan. Asia Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, in a brief video message said they were in danger in Pakistan.\n\n\"Please help us, we are in trouble in Pakistan,\" Masih appealed to Mr. Trump and May. Masih had previously told The Associated Press by phone that he and his wife feared for their lives. \"We are now living under an increased sense of fear.\"\n\nBibi's lawyer Saiful Malook has already fled the country for safety.\n\nBibi was arrested in 2009 after she was accused of blasphemy following a quarrel with two fellow female farm workers who refused to drink from a water container used by a Christian. A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam's prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction. Bibi's family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet.\n\nInsulting Islam is punishable by death in Pakistan, and the mere rumor of doing so can incite lynchings.\n\nPakistan's top court acquitted Bibi on Wednesday of the charges carrying the death penalty, infuriating hard-line Islamists who held three days of nationwide protests demanding her execution. The enraged protesters torched scores of vehicles, blocked highways and attacked government and public property; a radical cleric also threatened to kill the three judges who acquitted Bibi. According to the Reuters news agency, Cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, who leads the Islamist Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) party, had his Twitter account suspended on Monday for inciting violence.\n\nReuters\n\nThe protests ended after the government agreed to impose a travel ban on Bibi and allow her case to be reviewed. A review petition was filed in the Supreme Court.\n\n\"There will be a war if they send Asia out of country,\" Rizvi warned after the deal was reached, according to Reuters.\n\nEarlier in the day, police said over 150 people were arrested on charges of arson, vandalism and violence during the protests.\n\nSenior police officer Nayab Haider said that police were using video clips to identify those involved in assaults, torching property and vehicles, and blocking highways.\n\nDefending the police's actions, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the government cannot spare those involved in violence. He said that the government cleared blocked cities without any bloodshed.\n\nGetty\n\n\"No government can tolerate a rebellion against the state,\" Chaudhry said.\n\nHuman Rights Minister Shireen Mazari tweeted that \"appeasement to 'avoid bloodshed' sends a dangerous message to non-state actors and undermines the concept of democratic peaceful protest.\"\n\n\"The State has to enforce Rule of Law, Constitution and stand by state institutions especially when they are targeted\" Mazari added.\n\nAlso Sunday, some two thousands supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami party held a protest march in southern port city of Karachi against the acquittal of Bibi but they remained peaceful.", "CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis. -- There is unspeakable sadness in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. The community gathered Sunday night to remember four lives taken suddenly in a hit-and-run crash, reports CBS Minnesota.\n\nThree young Girl Scouts and a mother were killed Saturday while cleaning garbage out of a ditch in Lake Hallie, Wisconsin.\n\nPolice said 21-year-old Colten Treu was driving a pick-up truck that left the road and hit the troop.

Sokup said it wasn't \"an unsafe area.\"\n\nBut Cecily Spallees, a personal care attendant at a group home near the crash site, said drivers often go too fast there. The speed limit changes quickly from a 55-mph to a 35-mph zone.\n\n\"I'm always telling one of my residents that he shouldn't walk this strip at night,\" Spallees told the newspaper. \"It's not safe.\"\n\nIt wasn't clear whether Treu somehow got distracted, Sokup said.\n\nGirl Scouts of the USA CEO Sylvia Acevedo issued a statement saying, \"Our hearts are broken for the girls and families of the Girl Scouts of the Northwestern Great Lakes.

It hits me especially hard since I have two children of my own,\" Chippewa Falls resident Jill Schafer told CBS Minnesota.\n\nSchafer was one of hundreds who gathered for a vigil outside Halmstad Elementary School in Chippewa Falls to pray for the vitcims.\n\n\"I have one son here that's in Scouts and he's wearing his Scout uniform to help represent the scouting community,\" Schafer said.\n\nInvestigators said the Girl Scouts, mostly fourth graders and parent volunteers, were cleaning trash along a county road when the pickup Treu was driving veered into the ditch, hitting several of them before driving off. Two girls and a parent died at the scene. A third girl died at a hospital.\n\n\"I was in tears this morning. I will be weeping often this morning, I know that,\" Pastor Jim Woldhuis said.\n\nWoldhuis said the mother and daughter who died attended Chippewa Valley Bible Church, where he presides.\n\n\"Just a fun-loving girl, Girl Scout. Just your typical little fourth grade girl skipping through life,\" Woldhuis observed.\n\nAnd her mother \"had faith, she had purpose and invested herself in her children,\" Woldhuis added.\n\nMonday morning, counselors, psychologists, therapy dogs and faith leaders will again be at the two elementary schools where the victims were students.\n\nLake Hallie Police were also expected to release the victims' names.", "GARY, Ind. -- Former President Obama praised Indiana Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly Sunday for being willing to break with his party, telling a roaring crowd at a rally in the state that \"you don't want just a yes man.\"\n\nDonnelly has sounded more like President Trump while trying to persuade voters in the conservative Midwestern state to grant him a second term. He's angered some Democrats by tacking to the right in recent weeks and embracing some of Mr. Trump's pet priorities, such as building a border wall with Mexico.\n\nBut Mr. Obama told voters during the rally in Gary that Donnelly \"tries to do right by people\" - not just his party - and noted he supported the Affordable Care Act, the health care overhaul passed under Mr. Obama.\n\n\"Joe Donnelly and I didn't agree all the time. But Joe always let me know where he stood and I knew what he believed in and that he always was focused on: 'What's the best thing for the Hoosiers that he served?\"' Mr. Obama said. \"He was honest and he was direct. So you can count on that. That's what you want. You don't want just a yes man all the time.\"\n\nMr. Obama's stop was sandwiched between his successor's trips to the state Friday and Monday on behalf of GOP Senate candidate Mike Braun.\n\nIt was also part of a series of appearances as the two presidents hit the campaign trail hard appearances in the days leading to Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\nFor Braun, a businessman who has campaigned as a steadfast Trump ally, the current president's appearances in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne are no-brainers in a state he won two years ago by 19 points.\n\nBut for Donnelly, who frequently touts how often he votes with Mr. Trump, the Obama rally was a little more complicated.\n\n\"If he does need to inoculate himself from some of his firmer conservative rhetoric, it's a pretty effective way to do it,\" said Christina Hale, a former state lawmaker and the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2016.\n\nMr. Obama has proven a polarizing figure with independent and Republican voters and is credited with some of Indiana's rightward political shift, even though he won the state in 2008. To win in Tuesday's election, Donnelly not only needs high turnout from his party's base but also must peel off some moderate Republicans and independents.\n\nThat's why Sunday's rally in Gary, a heavily African-American city that has more in common with the Democratic stronghold of nearby Chicago than deep red parts of the state, could prove strategic. The northwest Indiana region supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, and driving turnout there on Tuesday will be critical for Donnelly.\n\nA spokesman for Braun, Josh Kelley, said Donnelly was \"doubling down on the liberal resistance movement\" by campaigning with Mr. Obama.\n\nMr. Obama criticized Republicans for passing a tax bill that benefited the wealthy and for trying to end protections for pre-existing conditions provided through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd without mentioning Mr. Trump's name, he told the crowd they could return the country to a kinder, less divisive kind of politics.\n\n\"On Tuesday you can vote for politics that is decent and honest and lawful and tries to do right by people like Joe Donnelly does,\" he said, adding at one point that his voice was growing hoarse from all his campaigning in recent days.\n\nMr. Trump was keenly aware of Mr. Obama's visit, which he mentioned Friday during an event at an Indianapolis-area high school.\n\n\"It's no surprise that Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this weekend with Barack H. Mr. Obama,\" Mr. Trump said as the crowd jeered. He later added: \"We don't want to go back to the Mr. Obama days.\"\n\nAs a red-state Democrat, Donnelly has had a target on his back ever since he unexpectedly defeated Republican Richard Mourdock in 2012, when the former state treasurer said a woman who gets pregnant from her rapist is carrying a \"gift from God.\"\n\nDonnelly has walked a delicate line since then, often frustrating his own party and Republicans alike with the votes he takes.\n\nMr. Trump was having none of it on Friday, tying Donnelly to \"radical left\" figures in the party who are widely reviled by the GOP base.", "Editor's Note: The National Transportation Safety Board held a press briefing Monday with new details.

Love, Hitler\" were stuffed in his locker at school.\n\nMahler now works as a trauma nurse and was at Allegheny General Hospital when Bowers was wheeled into the emergency room, yelling, \"Death to all Jews.\" It was moments after Bowers' shooting rampage Oct. 27 where he killed 11 people.\n\n\"To be honest, I didn't see evil when I looked into Robert Bowers' eyes. All I saw was a clear lack of depth, intelligence and palpable amounts of confusion,\" Mahler wrote.\n\nMahler says Bowers thanked him for saving him, showing him kindness and treating him the same way he would treat any other patient.\n\n\"This was the same Robert Bowers that just committed mass homicide. The Robert Bowers who instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival,\" Mahler wrote.\n\nI am The Jewish Nurse. Yes, that Jewish Nurse. The same one that people are talking about in the Pittsburgh shooting... Posted by Ari Mahler on Saturday, November 3, 2018\n\nMahler says he doesn't think Bowers knew he was Jewish and he chose not to say anything and to show him empathy because he wanted Bowers to feel compassion.\n\n\"I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong,\" Mahler said.\n\nMahler ended his post by saying his actions came from love.\n\n\"Love. That's why I did it ... Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope,\" Mahler wrote. \"It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we're all here. ...

The mega online retailer announced it will offer free shipping on all holiday orders in time for Christmas, doing away with a minimum purchase price \u2014 even if you aren't a Prime member.\n\nThe company had previously set a threshold of $25 for orders to qualify for free shipping, but Amazon will waive that requirement starting Monday, according to the company. Hundreds of millions of items will therefore become eligible for free shipping.\n\nPrime members, who are already entitled to free two-day shipping, will also receive a new perk: More than 3 million items will be available for same-day delivery during the holiday season.\n\nThe move comes after Amazon's recent earnings report where revenue rose 29 percent to $56.58 billion, but was below the $57.05 billion analysts expected. Sales were $43.7 billion in the year-earlier period.\n\nFor the current quarter ending in December, Amazon said it expects revenue in the range of $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had expected revenue of $73.87 billion.\n\nRetailers can expect a robust holiday shopping spree this year.

Will Republicans count narrowly losing the House but adding to their Senate majority a \"loss?\"\n\nNonsense, says pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, co-founder of Echelon Insights. \"A 'good night' as a measure of seats beyond those needed for a majority is purely about results compared to expectations, which I think is silly. If you pick up a chamber, even by a seat, you pick up the powers to investigate, block bills you dislike, set the agenda, and such. That's a good night,\" Anderson says.\n\nLongtime Democratic strategist Bob Shrum is expecting \"something north of 30 seats, maybe 40.\"\n\nBut is that what the grassroots activists and Democratic base are expecting? Or do they believe the #BlueWave is on its way, and anything less will be a letdown?\n\nOn the substance, Anderson is right. It cannot be overstated how significant is it, from a governance standpoint, if the Democrats win the House by even a single vote. Just ask Senate Republicans who were serving in 2001 when Vermont Republican Jim Jeffords switched parties and handed control of the upper chamber to the Democrats.\n\nWinning the majority, however slim, means controlling committees who can hold hearings and issue subpoenas. For example, Massachusetts liberal Richie Neal would take over the House Ways and Means Committee, which has oversight of the IRS; while Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland would lead the House Oversight Committee, which can investigate pretty much anyone. The current over/under on how long it'll take Democrats in Congress to access Donald Trump's tax returns and dump them on the desk of the New York Times is 45 minutes.\n\nAssuming they hit traffic.\n\nSo in that sense, expectations are irrelevant. Nancy Pelosi doesn't need enthusiasm to become speaker, just votes.\n\nBut what about the millions of progressive activists who've poured their passion\u2014and some $1 billion --into the #BlueWave? They've been reading Peter Hamby in Vanity Fair (\"The Blue Wave is Real\u2014And It's a Monster!\"). They've been hearing talk about 40, 50\u2026.99 congressional seats in play! And Beto's about to win in Texas, yeehaw!\n\nSo what happens if, as CBS News' poll predicts, Democrats pick up just 25 seats? Or fewer\u2014a real possibility? And worse\u2014thanks to likely pick-ups in the Senate, nominating the next Brett Kavanaugh just got easier? Does that sound like a big win?\n\nJim Geraghty, who's tracking the elections at the conservative National Review, says \"a scenario of Democrats winning, say, 33 seats giving them a ten-seat majority would be on paper a good night (and I think that scenario's pretty plausible). But I suspect a lot of Democrats would feel disappointed with that, given the pro-Democratic hype in the media.\"\n\nPoll analyst Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics takes a similar view: \"I think a good night for Democrats will be if they pick up 30 seats and hold Republicans to their current majority, or maybe even a Republican pick up of just one,\" Trende says.\n\nWhen asked if simply taking the majority by a single seat shouldn't count as a win, Trende said \"It's a bit of an under-performance. Plus, trying to get Reps.Ocasio-Cortez (progressive of Massachusetts) and Colin Peterson (Minnesota moderate) on board for anything.\"\n\nAnd then there are the Democrats still suffering political PTSD from Trump's 2016 victory and who cannot allow themselves to imagine a Democratic victory for fear of another disappointment. Politico quotes a September AP/MTV poll that found 61 percent of Democrats under 35 report \"feeling anxious\" over the midterms, while others are literally traumatized.\n\n\"We're kind of just in the bed-wetting phase now,\" Democratic pollster John Anzalone told Politico.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican activists are starting to tell themselves another story: That a narrow win for the Democrats is really a loss. Look at Obama's first midterm\u2014he lost 63 seats. Or Clinton's: Down 52. If Trump only loses half that, and picks up Senate seats, that's far better than Democratic presidents have done.\n\nAnd Republicans have added another talking point: Speaker Pelosi is Trump's ticket to re-election. She's one of the few politicians (other than Hillary Clinton) who polls as badly as he does. She's the perfect foil for Trump to use to eke out another win.\n\nOf course, Democrats really could catch a wave, and Republicans could wake up devastated. They could lose Nevada, Arizona and Tennessee in the U.S. Senate and, theoretically, control of the entire Congress.\n\nBut if Democrats take the House, and all of your liberal friends are in a lousier mood about it than your Republican ones\u2014don't be surprised.", "On Monday, the Trump administration will reimpose sanctions on the Iranian regime's energy, shipping and financial sectors, targeting over 700 entities. Many of these companies were initially hit by Obama-era sanctions that were subsequently lifted when the U.S. entered the Iran nuclear deal in 2015. Three hundred of the entities are new targets.\n\nMonday's action will be the most significant move resulting from President Trump's decision in May to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. The U.S. was not able to force Iranian oil exports to zero \u2014 which was its stated goal. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking with reporters on Friday, credited the intense pressure from the administration with driving down those exports substantially. So far, the decrease includes a significant reduction in the imports by China, by 200,000 barrels a day, according to a GAO report on Iran sanctions.\n\n\"Starting today, Iran will have zero oil revenue to spend on any of these things,\" Pompeo said, in reference to Iran's support for terrorism, military involvement in Syria, ballistic missile development and cyber hacking activities. \"Zero.\"\n\nAdministration officials say that Iran is already feeling the impact of the sanctions snapback. Iranian oil imports have cascaded downward in the last few months, since many companies and countries had anticipated the return of these sanctions.\n\n\"We will, we expect, have reduced Iranian crude oil exports by more than 1 million barrels even before these sanctions go into effect,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, which means slashing their current export numbers almost in half.\n\nEight countries will get sanction waivers, though the U.S. will not reveal the list of countries until Monday. Afghanistan, Iraq and South Korea are three countries on the list of waiver recipients, according to diplomatic sources, CBS News has confirmed. Other officials have said the list would include U.S. allies such as Turkey, Italy, India, Japan and South Korea, had made efforts to eliminate their imports but could not complete the task by Monday.\n\nThe Iranian regime will still be able to import humanitarian goods and other goods and services from the countries that are continuing to import their oil and have been given the exemption from the US. The countries will proactively push their imports down, and they will not be paying for what they are getting in cash, preventing the flow of funds to Iranian proxies in the Middle East, including Hezbollah.\n\n\"Some of these will take a few months to get to zero,\" Pompeo said. \"We will give them a little longer to wind down. Weeks.\"\n\nSWIFT, a financial messaging service at the heart of enabling Iranian business, will be subject to US sanctions if it continues to facilitate Iranian oil exports, but it is not among the 700 targets of Monday's sanctions snap-back.\n\n\"We have advised SWIFT the Treasury will aggressively use its authorities as necessary to continue intense economic pressure on the Iranian regime, and that SWIFT would be subject to U.S. sanctions if it provides financial messaging services to certain designated Iranian financial institutions,\" said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.\n\nCritics said the Trump administration is now using the very same strategy the Obama administration used: hard-charging sanctions to force Iran to the table for a deal. But ironically Mr. Trump ditched the deal that was in place. Administration officials claimed that Trump is pushing much harder on sanctions and will get a better deal in the end, by not focusing solely on Iran's nuclear program. They also say their approach is much tougher, citing as an example the eight \"temporary\" waivers, compared the the Obama administration's 20 waivers, according to Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran.\n\nThere has not yet been any significant tangible impact of these sanctions on the destabilizing \"death and destruction\" of the Iranian regime's proxies. The administration expects to see an impact eventually, though they won't put a time frame on it.\n\n\"We don't expect to start seeing these effects come into effect until later. Our sanctions don't go into effect until Monday,\" Hook, the US special representative for Iran, told CBS News. \"We expect to see more progress as our sanctions start to bite.\"\n\nThere are expected to be three phases in the Trump administration's approach here, according to Mark Dubowitz from the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, which is in regular contact with the Trump administration.\n\nPhase one was the maximalist demand of getting Iranian oil exports to as close to zero as possible ahead of November 5 without spiking oil prices. Phase 2 will be denying oil revenue to Iran by locking up these revenues in restricted accounts. Phase 3 would be later in 2019 when the administration assesses oil markets will be more fluid, and global demand is predicted to decrease which might allow the U.S. to move to cut the Iranian oil exports even further.\n\n\"They don't want all the Iranian oil off the market November 5, because that would spike the price and send additional revenues to Iran,\" explained Dubowitz. Hook said the U.S. had planned carefully in an effort to avoid causing such a spike.\n\nThere are other complicating factors in driving down the Iranian oil imports of some countries. A diplomat from one country noted that its systems are build for Iranian crude and importing oil from other countries would pose a challenge because it would mean a costly restructuring of the whole oil processing system.", "CHICAGO \u2014 The Coast Guard has suspended the search for a 52-year-old woman who went missing during a water event on Lake Michigan, CBS Chicago reported.
