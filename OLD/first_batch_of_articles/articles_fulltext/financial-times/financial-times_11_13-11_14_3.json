In the governor's race, you had Ron DeSantis, the Republican, leading by 84,000 votes on Wednesday after election day. And that lead evaporated to 44,000 on Saturday. And on the Senate race, you have Bill Nelson, the current Democratic senator. He is now behind Rick Scott, the Republican, by about 12,000 votes compared to 40,000 votes when polls closed on Tuesday.\n\nSo basically what the Democrats are trying to do right now, especially Bill Nelson, is to make sure this recount process goes on as long as possible and that they get any ballots that aren't counted, counted. So one issue of concern is Broward County, you saw about 20,000 voters or more not vote in the Senate race, but vote in the governor's race. And the Democrats are saying that maybe this was a problem with the ballot design and it wasn't very clear to those voters where the Senate race question was on the ballot.\n\nYou also have Democrats saying that there are certain issues with mail in ballots and do the signatures need to match? And basically, all this is doing is creating this kind of drawn out process in Florida, which, as we all know, was home to the 2000 recount efforts, and caused a lot of headaches for the rest of the country. Rick Scott, the Republican Senate candidate, was in Washington DC this week, along with all the other new freshman senators.\n\nSo Republicans feel pretty confident that he is going to win, but this is a process that could still drag on. The machine recount for the Senate race was supposed to have finished on Thursday. But there is a hand recount as well because it's expected to be lower than a quarter of a percentage point difference between the two candidates. So we could be seeing this going on for a couple of weeks into the future.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

These documents were the result of thousands of hours of hard negotiation by UK officials and many, many meetings which I and other ministers held with our EU counterparts.\n\nI firmly believe that the Draft Withdrawal Agreement was the best that could be negotiated. And it was for the cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks. The choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop. But the collective decision of cabinet was that the government should agree the Draft Withdrawal Agreement and the outlying political declaration.\n\nThis is a decisive step, which enables us to move on and finalise the deal in the days ahead. These decisions were not taken lightly, but I believe it is a decision that is firmly in the national interest. When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear. This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum - which brings about control of our money, laws, and orders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security, and our union - or leave with no deal or no Brexit at all.\n\nI know that there will be difficult days ahead. This is a decision which will come under intense scrutiny. And that is entirely as it should be and entirely understandable. But the choice was this deal - which enables us to take back control and to build a brighter future for our country - or going back to square one with more division and more uncertainty and a failure to deliver on the referendum.\n\nIt's my job as prime minister to explain the decisions that the government has taken. And I stand ready to do that, beginning tomorrow with a statement in parliament. But if I may end by just saying this. I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest. And I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThe \u20ac1m world title match at Holborn, London, was locked at 2-2 after four games (of 12) in mid-week. Earlier, Norway\u2019s global No1 Magnus Carlsen missed good chances to take an immediate lead with the black pieces against his US challenger Fabiano Caruana.\n\nThe next three games were drawn, so with more halves in prospect Carlsen\u2019s errors could prove expensive.\n\nCarlsen won the toss at the opening ceremony and chose Black in game one. His thinking was that at the mid-point, Friday\u2019s game six and Sunday\u2019s seven, the colours switch so that with two Whites in a row he can maximise the pressure.\n\nCaruana began game one solidly against the Sicilian, then made some passive decisions. Stage fright, probably, like Tigran Petrosian and Bobby Fischer in their 1963 and 1972 debuts.\n\nCarlsen dominated the middle game, computer evaluations rose to -2 and -3 indicating Black was winning, Caruana became acutely short of time, but there was no finishing punch. Frustrated, Carlsen played on for seven hours to move 115, the third longest game in championship history, before conceding the draw.\n\nThe tension will build this weekend and as the match moves into its closing games next week.

And Mr Speaker, I will come back to the House to update it on the outcome.\n\nIt breaches the prime minister's own red lines. It doesn't deliver a strong economic deal that supports jobs and industry. And we know they haven't prepared seriously for no deal. So does the prime minister still intend to put a false choice to parliament between her botched deal or no deal?\n\nThere needs to be a backstop as an insurance policy, but neither side actually wants us to be in that backstop, because we want to bring the future relationship into place at the end of December, 2020. And I'm aware of the concerns that there are, that we don't want to be in a position where the European Union would find it comfortable to keep the United Kingdom in the backstop permanently. And that's why any backstop has to be temporary.\n\nWe will not rerun the referendum. We will not renege on the decision of the British people. We will leave the customs union. We will leave the Common Fisheries Policy. We will leave the Common Agricultural Policy. And we will take back control of our money, laws and borders. We will deliver Brexit and the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on the 29th of March 2019.\n\nMr Peter Bone.\n\nThank you, Mr Speaker. Is the prime minister aware that if the media reports about the EU agreement are in any way accurate, you are not delivering the Brexit people voted for. And today, you will lose the support of many Conservative MPs and millions of voters across the country.\n\nCan I say to, can I say to my honourable friend, that what we have been negotiating is a deal that does deliver on the vote of the British people. In the list that I set out earlier, I left out one of the things that the British people are very keen to see from this deal, which is an end to free movement. And we will ensure that we are delivering on that, as well as those other elements that I have set out. What we're doing is a deal that delivers on that vote. But in doing so, protects jobs, protects the integrity of our United Kingdom, and protects the security of people in this country.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

That translates to 800 million jobs lost globally. School education is the first step to equipping future generations for this jobs revolution. Singapore is often at the top of the OECD's ranking that tests 15-year-olds' abilities in science, reading, maths, and problem solving. But experts argue that soft skills such as adaptability, agility, and an openness to change are essential to deal with the jobs of tomorrow.\n\nSingapore's minister for education, Ong Ye Kung, says the city-state's emphasis on academic excellence may have deprived students of the innovative spirit, entrepreneurial zest, and survival instincts needed in the real world. But now, the city-state is bringing the world of work closer to schools. Mr Ong is exploring ways to apply features of the Swiss education system, classroom study combined with apprenticeships, to Singapore. And by 2023, all Singaporean primary schools will have an Applied Learning Programme aimed at nurturing creativity and innovation to prepare Singapore's children for the future.\n\nUnder the SkillsFuture Initiative, all Singaporeans aged 25 and above are given about $400 to choose among 18,000 courses aimed at improving work skills. As of December 2016, more than 120,000 people, 4% of eligible Singaporeans, had signed up, with more than 60% being over 40 years of age. If successful, Singapore will have an education revolution to match the job revolution that is just around the corner.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.
