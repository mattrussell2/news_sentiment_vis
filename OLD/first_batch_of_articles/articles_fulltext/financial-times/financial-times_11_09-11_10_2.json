I think if you think the last two years have been interesting - that first half of Trump's term - then you ain't seen nothing yet. This is going to be the mother of all tussles between the White House and the Democratic House.\n\nIt's really interesting that the first thing he did after the defeat in the House was hold the longest press conference he has ever held - just under an hour and a half, in which he repeated what he'd said on Twitter, which was, if you investigate me - \"you\" meaning the Democrats in the House - then I will investigate you from the Senate - from the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nSo it's kind of a B-movie threat there, that, OK, I can do to you what you can do to me. I think it's kind of a hollow, B-movie threat though, because it's just not the case that there's nearly as many rich investigative potentials from the Senate as there are investigating Trump from the House. It's going to be a golden age of subpoenas, investigations, televised hearings. And that's not going to put Trump in a good mood.\n\nThe House itself is not the most significant player in foreign policy. Easily, the White House and Trump have the most influence over foreign policy. Then you have the Senate. So the House is in a bit of a funny position, because they're going to find it quite hard to push legislative initiatives on their own or even in concert with the Senate.\n\nBut what they do have is the right to subpoena senior administration officials, to claim a lot more oversight, to demand explanations. And already we've got a flavour that they are going to ask the Trump administration:\n\nWhat exactly is going on with North Korea? Why can't we see all the information? What is your relationship with Vladimir Putin? Can we know a little bit more about so-called election interference on the part of the Russians? Maybe they're not satisfied with what the Republicans have done so far.\n\nAlthough there are tensions over how much the House is going to exact from the Trump administration, there's also a sense that people want to keep things rolling. And even with really quite divergent views, many of these committee chairmen have worked with each other in the past - have a history of compromise.\n\nSo, one doesn't expect to see too much change in the direction of foreign policy. But certainly in terms of the rhetoric, in terms of supporting alliances, bolstering Nato - all of these elements that people have been so frustrated by when it comes to Trump's own policies - we're likely to see a much greater push to support some of these initiatives.\n\nSo 2018 was called the \"Year of the Woman.\" And I think it lived up to that name on Tuesday night here. You had a record number of women being elected to Congress. So there now will be more than 100 women in the US House of Representatives next year, compared to just 84, currently.\n\nSo that's a huge milestone. I mean, it's still, obviously, a fraction of the overall House. But people are seeing this as a big achievement. And in the end, we saw a lot of firsts. We saw the first two native American women be elected to Congress. We saw the first two Muslim women be elected to Congress.\n\nAnd obviously, there were some losses across the board. Stacey Abrams, who would be the first African-American woman to be the governor of Georgia, is locked in a recount in her state. But I think overall, you saw really impressive numbers for women.\n\nAnd arguably, the women candidates were the candidates who helped bring the Democrats over the finish line in the House. And so I think they're hugely responsible for the Democrats taking back the House.\n\nDemocrats are in an ambiguous situation, because they have made inroads, but not as deep as they would have expected earlier this year or this time last year when Donald Trump's approval rating was at a particular low. They also have this pretty epic dilemma now of which way they go when it comes to handing out the presidential election nomination for 2020.\n\nThe progressives, the left of the party, have felt pretty confident in recent months that they represent the future of the party. But they suffered a bit of a setback on Tuesday, simply because some of their favoured candidates - in Florida, Andrew Gillum, and Stacey Abrams in Georgia - both fell short. Beto O'Rourke in Texas did much better, but, again, did not win.\n\nAnd as a result, the progressive end of the party has fewer successes, fewer potential future stars to point to than they thought they might do a while ago. And the mainstream or the centre or the Clintonian bit of the party - however you want to term it - I think might feel a little bit emboldened because of those results, and therefore will be able to stage a serious fight for the Democratic ticket in 2020.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nSouth Korean president Moon Jae-in on Friday replaced two key economic officials, including the finance minister, as pressure mounts on his administration to kick-start growth in Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy.\n\nEconomic issues have moved to the forefront of South Korean politics in recent months as slowing growth and weakening jobs data weigh on the president\u2019s approval rating.\n\nThe issue is particularly important for Mr Moon, who was elected last year on the back of populist pledges to create jobs and reduce inequality in a nation that has for decades been dominated by a handful of wealthy conglomerates.\n\nHowever, his efforts, which included raising the minimum wage in a bid to spur consumption, have fallen flat.\n\nThe Bank of Korea had cut its gross domestic product growth forecast for this year from 3 per cent to 2.7 per cent, as global trade tensions weigh on the export-dominated economy.\n\nUnemployment has also been ticking up as traditional manufacturing industries, such as shipbuilding and automobiles, shed jobs amid increasing competition from lower cost Chinese rivals.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Moon moved to revitalise his economic team by replacing Kim Dong-yeon, finance minister, and Jang Ha-sung, presidential chief of staff for policy.\n\nThe two officials had themselves clashed in recent weeks, with Mr Kim pushing to depart from Mr Moon\u2019s trademark \u201cincome-led growth\u201d policy that seeks to create a virtuous cycle of increased incomes, consumption and employment.\n\nMr Jang, considered the architect of the trickle-up policy, publicly disagreed with Mr Kim.\n\nThe reshuffle sets the stage for new economic ideas in a nation that is struggling to transition away from its once-successful manufacturing model.\n\nHowever, Mr Moon on Friday doubled down on his commitment to a \u201cfair economy\u201d that does not only enrich the country\u2019s conglomerates, known as the chaebol.\n\n\u201cIn the past, our people worked day and night under the goal of building a well-off nation and became an economic power . . . in just half a century, but fairness was lost in the course of economic growth. Those jointly achieved results were claimed by the conglomerates,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRealising economic democracy through a fair economy is the way to make ordinary people, back-alley businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, and conglomerates well-off together.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric is a common refrain in South Korea, where the family-run chaebol turn immense profits, while small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ the majority of the population, struggle.\n\nCritics point out, however, that the Moon administration has done little to tackle the dominance of the conglomerates since it came to power. After an initial push, corporate reform efforts have stalled.\n\n\u201cIt appears the president is going to stick with the current income-led growth policy,\u201d said Yoon Chang-hyun, a former president of the Korea Institute of Finance. \u201cPeople will ask: \u2018Why change the officials if you don\u2019t intend to change the policies?
