You're not coming in. You're not coming in.\n\nThe US midterm elections are a referendum on Donald Trump. Over the past two months, the president has criss-crossed the nation to help the Republicans save their majorities in the House and Senate. In recent weeks, Trump has returned to the law and order theme that helped him win the White House in 2016. His closing argument has been to stoke fears about migrants and asylum seekers heading towards the US. Days before the poll, he said he would send troops to the border to prevent the migrants from entering the country.\n\nTo see how immigration is dividing American voters, we went to the frontier state of Texas and inland to Tennessee. In Texas, Beto O'Rourke, a former punk rocker, is challenging Republican Senator Ted Cruz in a way that nobody thought possible. The race pits an arch conservative against a charismatic liberal challenger who Cruz describes as a socialist and has nicknamed Comrade Beto.\n\nBeto has raised more money than any Senate candidate in history, taking in $38m in the last quarter from individual donors, and is chasing Cruz in the polls. But Texas has not elected a Democrat to statewide office in more than two decades. We followed Beto around Dallas, and then to Amarillo, a conservative cattle trading city that voted 80 per cent for Trump in 2016.\n\nAll right, we're going to hold just a sec to get...\n\nBefore his rally at the Six Car Pub, I asked Beto what he thought about Trump using immigration to whip up his white conservative base.\n\nI think we have the choice of all choices before us. It can be fear and paranoia and hatred and anxiety, or it can be confidence and strength and the kindheartedness by which Texas has so long distinguished itself. That's on the ballot right now. And I've got to tell you, everywhere we go, including in Amarillo, every single visit that we make to this community, I've seen the strength, the courage, the confidence of this state shine through.\n\nNancy and Abel Bosquez, are Texans, but with deep Mexican roots. For them, Trump's anti-Mexican rhetoric is personal.\n\nThese people are coming here for seeking asylum. And he's making it look like they're criminals, and they're not.\n\nBut Texas is still a red state, and you don't have to go too far to find someone who supports Trump and Cruz. I meet Jason Harlow, a cattle trader from Dallas, who fears that the Democrats would introduce socialism and liberal values.\n\nI'm definitely a Cruz supporter. And I like Donald Trump, as well. And I feel - I understand maybe not everybody likes those two guys' personalities, but at this point in our country, I don't think personality should be what we're really worried about if there is a move toward socialism.\n\nWhile the migrant caravan remains far from the US, Trump is hoping that the images of thousands of people heading towards the border will stoke fear and turn out voters on November 6. Texas is right on the frontier of the immigration debate. But 1,700km inland, on the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in Tennessee, some Republicans are just as fearful about illegal immigrants, even in areas that are overwhelmingly white.\n\nHere, Marsha Blackburn, a Tea Party Republican, is using the caravan issue to attack Phil Bredesen, a former Democratic governor who is challenging her for an open Senate seat. We managed to track down Bredesen at a rally outside a polling station.\n\nVoters at early polling stations in Chattanooga were fired up about the events happening thousands of kilometres away in Mexico.\n\nI don't feel like our money should be going to support immigrants that are coming here illegally. And all of these people that are on welfare and food stamps that are able-bodied and able to work should be doing so. We did this. We worked all of our lives. And right now, we're having to pinch pennies to get by.\n\nTrump has ramped up the rhetoric much as he did in the final weeks of the presidential election. At rallies, he's geed up his supporters by painting Democrats as a mob of socialists who are weak on crime and border security. To make sure nobody misses his closing argument, Trump shared a video on Twitter showing an illegal immigrant from Mexico bragging in court about killing American police officers. Critics have described the ad as racist, and accused Trump of using a dog whistle to spread fear.\n\nWe will build a great wall along the southern border.\n\nIn some ways, Trump may be trying to make up for the fact that he's not been able to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, despite the fanfare during his 2016 campaign. But our travels around Texas and Tennessee reveal the stark divide over immigration in a country of immigrants, a battle that will return to the fore in just a few weeks, as the first Democrats launch their campaigns for the 2020 presidential race.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nThe Financial Times is pleased to announce the launch of the submission process for the 2019 Innovative Lawyers report and awards for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nFT Innovative Lawyers is a unique programme that assesses lawyers on their innovation for clients and in their own businesses. The programme consists of rankings and awards, based on independent research from RSG Consulting and robust journalism from the FT. The results are announced at an awards event, and the rankings are published in both print and online as an FT special report.\n\nLaw firms and in-house legal teams are invited to submit to four broad sections: legal expertise, the business of law/operations, access to justice and rule of law, and innovative individuals. This year we have again deliberately left the categories broad, allowing firms and companies more freedom to choose initiatives from any practice area or part of the business.\n\nThe 2019 Asia-Pacific Innovative Lawyers report will provide a comparison of how in-house and private practice lawyers are innovating. Each category will include two ranking tables and two awards. We will also continue to investigate efforts to uphold the rule of law and access to justice across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nWhy innovation?\n\nSince it was established, the FT report has sought to break with the usual criteria of measuring lawyers by revenues, profits or deal sizes. Instead, it aims to uncover the real value that lawyers deliver to business and reward the lawyers consistently furthering the interests of their clients, their own firms or companies and the profession itself.\n\nHow are the report and the awards assessed?\n\n\n\nThe rankings will be based primarily on submissions received but will also include fresh research, surveys and other qualitative research methods to uncover legal innovation in the region.\n\nThe FT Innovative Lawyers programme was established in Europe in 2006, launched in the US and North America in 2010, and in Asia-Pacific in 2014. Over the past 12 years it has covered legal industry innovation in 50 countries from more than 400 law firms and more than 465 company in-house legal departments. The submission deadline is Friday January 11, 2019. The research process will run from January to April. The report will be published with the Financial Times newspaper on Friday May 3, 2019 and launched at the awards event at the Asia Society, Hong Kong on the evening of Thursday May 2, 2019. The awards event will recognise the standout innovators across all categories of the report. There is no cost for submitting entries but the project will be subject to the terms and conditions outlined in detail below. The research partner for the FT Innovative Lawyers programme is RSG Consulting, a specialist research and consulting company with decades of experience analysing the legal industry. The FT Innovative Lawyers programme is supported globally by lead partner, Elevate, and partner QuisLex.\n\nCategories 2019\n\n\u25a0 Legal expertise\n\nSubmissions invited from: private practice law firms and company in-house legal teams.\n\nSubmission limit: A maximum of five submissions may be made to the legal expertise section by any one firm or company in-house legal team.\n\nThis section will look at lawyers\u2019 work for clients, including in-house lawyers\u2019 work for their internal business clients, and will recognise lawyers who have developed new structures and products, new legal strategies or new law to meet their clients\u2019 business challenges.

The chancellor\u2019s late start and long-winded speech on Monday meant that by the time he finished, the FT had less than three hours to write, edit and produce a 20-page Budget special.\n\nThere were no scary financial shocks for the wealthy \u2014 although there was one for me. With less than an hour to deadline, one of my teeth fell out.\n\nA troublesome crown came loose as I was chewing over the impact of income tax changes. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this now,\u201d I thought. So I just pretended it hadn\u2019t happened. I popped the tooth on my keyboard and carried on typing.\n\nI then emailed my dentist, and by 10.30am the next morning I had a gleaming temporary gnasher. It was as if it had never happened.\n\nLooking back at the Budget, I get the same sense of disbelief. For the chancellor to spend money he may well not have on a feel-good income tax cut is a massive gamble \u2014 and shows how much the Conservatives fear a general election.\n\nNo Brexit deal has been done, the rosy forecasts could evaporate as quickly as they appeared and the promise to \u201cend austerity\u201d has a hollow ring when billions of pounds of welfare cuts are still working their way through the system.\n\nFighting the rising tide of plastic waste was another issue that came to the fore in the Budget. I know readers care deeply about the environment, both in your personal lives and investment choices. The rise of \u201cESG\u201d investing \u2014 standing for environmental, social and governance \u2014 has been a huge story this year.\n\nA consultation into a \u201cplastic tax\u201d has been launched, which would impose a levy on all packaging that does not include at least 30 per cent recycled material by 2022, but the chancellor stopped short of a \u201clatte levy\u201d on disposable takeaway cups.\n\nOne of my most-read columns this year calculated the return on investment on a reusable coffee cup. My drip-free reusable KeepCup has more than paid for itself since then. It cost nearly \u00a313, but nets me a 50p discount in some coffee chains.\n\nIt has also solved another minor middle class annoyance. As a Waitrose & Partners loyalty card holder, I\u2019m entitled to a daily free coffee. However, the queue in the branch near the FT office has often been enormous. Not any more! Now that the supermarket has decreed that customers have to bring their own reusable cup, it\u2019s easy peasy.\n\nThis is part of a wider pledge to cut packaging waste and find alternatives to black plastic \u2014 commonly used for posh ready meals and premium fruit and veg \u2014 which is notoriously hard to recycle. That\u2019s good. But even if you pride yourself on faithfully rinsing out cans, trays and yoghurt pots, I have some bad news \u2014 recycling is no longer the answer.\n\nOnce collected, our recycling is shipped around the world. China had been the centre of the global recycling trade, but a year ago, decided to stop taking most of it. Experts say this has created a \u201cglobal crisis\u201d in plastic waste. As the FT reported a few weeks ago, collection bags emblazoned with the names of London councils have been found dumped in Malaysia. We simply cannot carry on as we are.\n\n\u201cZero waste\u201d campaigners say rather than rely on recycling, we should look to the other Rs \u2014 refuse, reduce, reuse and rot.\n\nMany environmentally sustainable ideas are also pleasingly thrifty and old fashioned. Buying loose fruit and veg in a paper bag; brewing loose leaf tea instead of using tea bags (which contain plastic); putting scraps on the compost heap and taking the bottles back to the shop to get the deposit.\n\n\u201cMake do and mend\u201d was the money-saving mantra of my grandparents. I support the grassroots movement of consumers fighting for the \u201cright to repair\u201d items such as iPhones and washing machines rather than chuck them away and buy new ones.\n\nPrevious generations had no choice. Their thriftiness was driven by a lack of cash. I find that my worst excesses are driven by the need for convenience.\n\nI am cash rich but time poor. I can order my shopping online and it will arrive the next day swaddled in packaging, having been driven to my door in a Diesel van. Even worse? Takeaway food, which is either covered in mounds of plastic, or greasy cardboard that cannot be recycled. I am trying to mend my ways.\n\nEven if I haven\u2019t got a lot of money, I could buy a \u00a35 dress online \u2014 the subject of a furious debate in Parliament this week on the sustainability of fast fashion. Our disposable attitude towards cheap clothing means that 400,000 tons ends up in landfill every year, and washing all those man-made fibres means plastic is leaching into waste water.\n\nDo sustainable choices have to be expensive? Natural fibres cost a lot more. But by buying fewer, more sustainable items and keeping them for longer (with the odd darn) we could be better off and so could the planet.\n\nI am fascinated by the rise of zero-waste shops. One of London\u2019s biggest \u2014 Bulk Market \u2014 is set to reopen in new premises in Hackney this month, after crowdfunding more than \u00a320,000 from supporters. Shoppers bring their own jars and containers, then weigh and fill them with all kinds of items from dried goods to olive oil and even craft beer and gin. Back in the day, the Body Shop used to do this for dewberry bubble bath.\n\nSlapping a tax on plastic is one way of addressing the problem. But if, in his next public outing, Mr Hammond can come up with a way of encouraging good behaviour as well as penalising bad, we could see such schemes proliferate \u2014 along with the investment opportunities that go with them.\n\nClaer Barrett is the editor of FT Money.

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nWealthy readers could be forgiven for thinking that they don\u2019t need to make changes to their financial plans following Monday\u2019s Budget.\n\nWith no end in sight to the Brexit negotiations, the prime minister\u2019s pledge to end austerity meant that advisers were braced for tax rises. However, due to better than expected forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), chancellor Philip Hammond did no such thing.\n\n\u201cUsually, we are deluged with calls from clients following the Budget as they seek advice about the impact of any changes,\u201d says Michael Martin, relationship manager at Seven Investment Management. \u201cThis year, it\u2019s like the Budget never happened.\u201d\n\nHowever, advisers stress the risk of the chancellor being forced to raise taxes if Brexit negotiations go awry. Mr Hammond himself said at the despatch box that he was \u201cconfident, but not complacent\u201d about a deal being secured, and that the Spring Statement next March could be upgraded to a \u201cfull fiscal event\u201d if necessary.\n\nHere, FT Money presents the main areas where readers should consider taking action.\n\nPay into your pension\n\nPensions tax relief was untouched in this week\u2019s Budget, providing some breathing space for higher earners who have endured a dozen reductions to their savings allowances in the past decade.\n\nBefore the chancellor was handed his Budget windfall from the OBR, he had described the \u00a325bn annual cost of pension tax relief as \u201c eye wateringly expensive\u201d. Experts warn there is no certainty how long current savings limits will last, and advise clients to make the most of their full tax allowances while they can.\n\nCurrently, the annual pension savings limit is \u00a340,000 before tax charges apply. For those with total incomes of \u00a3150,000 or more, the annual allowance taper introduced in 2016 gradually reduces this to \u00a310,000 for those earning more than \u00a3210,000.\n\nHowever, it is possible for unused annual allowance from the three previous tax years to be carried forward and added to the annual allowance for the current tax year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to get tax relief on pension contributions up to the amount you earn, but there\u2019s a cap of \u00a340,000 every year for most people, says Nathan Long, senior analyst with Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nThose who are affected by the annual allowance taper might find that it is possible to pay contributions above the cap by capitalising on unused contributions from the previous three years.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have enough spare cash from income to boost your contributions today, consider tapping into savings and investments to mop up unused tax relief, suggests Mr Long.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to involve selling any investments and making a contribution in cash,\u201d he says. \u201cThe money will be locked up until your mid-50s, so you\u2019d need to be sure that you wouldn\u2019t need it until later life, but it could allow you to maximise a tax advantage now.\u201d\n\nBut while pensions are very tax efficient, they are also inflexible for younger people, who won\u2019t be able to access their money until at least the age of 55.\n\n\u201cFor many people the best approach for long-term investing is therefore a combination of pensions and Isas and so maximising pension contributions might not be the most suitable choice,\u201d says Patrick Connolly, chartered financial planner with Chase de Vere.\n\nSpeak to your employer and check whether you can make your pension contributions using \u201csalary sacrifice\u201d, which is another tax efficient way to save for retirement.\n\nThis method means you don\u2019t pay national insurance on the value of the contribution, saving higher and additional rate taxpayers 2 per cent and basic rate taxpayers 12 per cent, says Mr Long. However, be aware that salary sacrifice arrangements can impact how much you can borrow from a mortgage lender, or the level of maternity pay you will receive.\n\nEven if you have used up all of your tax allowances, don\u2019t neglect those that your spouse may have. It is possible to fund their pensions contributions so long as you have sufficient earnings to generate the tax relief, says Christine Ross, head of wealth advice with Handelsbanken Wealth Management.\n\nIf one partner does not work it is still worth them contributing up to \u00a33,600 each year. The contribution attracts tax relief at the basic rate even if the member is a non-taxpayer, making a net cost of \u00a32,880.\n\n\u201cIf a partner is unlikely to have any other income of their own in retirement the pension will use up some or all of that individual\u2019s personal allowance, providing tax-free income,\u201d says Ms Ross. \u201cUnder current rules, a quarter of the fund can also be taken tax free.\u201d\n\nThe same \u00a33,600 allowance may be used to fund pensions for children. In all cases the funds cannot be accessed until after the age of 55 although there are proposals to increase this.\n\nWatch your marginal tax rate\n\nMost people will pay less income tax from next April after the personal allowance and higher rate tax thresholds were unexpectedly increased in the Budget \u2014 but higher earners will see part of that gain cancelled out by linked increases to national insurance.\n\nAccelerating the changes planned for 2020 was the \u201cstar bunny\u201d that Mr Hammond pulled from his hat. Although this was a Conservative manifesto pledge, many expected it to be scrapped to fund increased spending on public services.\n\nThe personal allowance threshold, after which basic rate income tax applies, will rise to \u00a312,500 from April 2019, from its current level of \u00a311,850. The higher rate threshold \u2014 after which income tax of 40 per cent applies \u2014 will also rise to \u00a350,000 from the current level of \u00a346,350.\n\nThe changes mean that in the next tax year, basic rate taxpayers can expect to pay \u00a3130 less income tax, rising to \u00a3860 for higher rate taxpayers earning up to \u00a3100,000.\n\nHowever, these calculations fail to take account of linked increases to the upper earnings limit for national insurance contributions. Sir Steve Webb, director of policy of Royal London, calculates the difference to net take home pay for higher earners would only be about \u00a3500.\n\n\u201cThe chancellor should have come clean and mentioned this in the Budget speech, rather than leave it in the Budget small print,\u201d Sir Steve says.\n\nReaders in Scotland will have to wait until the Scottish Budget on December 12 to see if Scotland\u2019s higher-rate tax threshold \u2014 currently \u00a343,430 \u2014 will also rise. However, national insurance rates are not devolved, so next April\u2019s changes will apply across the UK.\n\nAssuming Scottish tax thresholds are unchanged, this means someone in Scotland earning \u00a350,000 will pay an extra \u00a330.41 per month in national insurance contributions without saving anything in income tax, says Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon.\n\nThe enlarged personal allowance will also complicate matters for those earning more than \u00a3100,000. Once you earn more than this amount, the \u00a312,500 personal allowance is withdrawn at the rate of \u00a31 for every \u00a32 of income. This effectively creates a marginal tax rate of 60 per cent on the slice of earnings between \u00a3100,000 and \u00a3125,000.\n\nThis \u201ccliff edge\u201d existed before the Budget, but it now covers a slightly larger band of income.\n\nNimesh Shah, partner at Blick Rothenberg, says those who are approaching these thresholds may be able to reduce their taxable income by making higher pension contributions, claiming Gift Aid on charitable donations or controlling the timings of other income, for example dividend payments from family companies.\n\n\u201cFor future years, income may be reduced by replacing taxable income streams with tax-free returns by investing through an individual savings account (Isa) or investing for capital growth rather than income,\u201d he says. \u201cIn addition, individuals can benefit from tax relief by making certain tax-efficient investments in a Venture Capital Trust or shares in an Enterprise Investment Scheme.\u201d\n\nIf dividend income or savings interest takes your annual earnings into six figures, you could also consider transferring assets to a lower-earning spouse.\n\nGiven the anxiety over future pensions tax changes, increasing contributions to your retirement fund could prove doubly attractive to taxpayers within this bracket.\n\nEven if an employee is already making the maximum contribution that is matched by their company, additional voluntary pension contributions (AVCs) can be made tax-free so long as that individual has not breached their annual or lifetime allowances.\n\nHowever, Lucy Brennan, partner at Saffery Champness, an accountancy group, says taxpayers should not regard this route as a panacea. \u201cOn pensions contributions, for example, it feels like you are putting money away for less but the tax payment is really just being deferred \u2014 depending on your circumstances in retirement \u2014 and, in the meantime, the money is locked away,\u201d she says.\n\nWill you still count as self-employed?\n\nIT contractors, consultants and TV presenters are among self-employed workers in the private sector facing a steep rise in taxes and a potential drop in income following changes announced at the Budget.\n\nThe government wants to crack down on freelances who hire themselves out via personal service companies, but are effectively employed.\n\nSelf-employed workers pay lower rates of income tax and national insurance than those on the payroll. The companies who employ them also benefit as they don\u2019t have to pay employer national insurance contributions (NICs), pensions, or sick pay.\n\nFrom April 2020, reforms to the \u201coff-payroll\u201d working rules will mean private sector companies who cannot prove their workers are self-employed will become liable for paying employer NICs and deducting higher taxes from their workers\u2019 pay.\n\nThe change will not affect all companies according to HM Revenue & Customs \u2014 the 1.5m smallest businesses in the country will be exempt \u2014 but medium and large businesses have until April 2020 to implement the changes.\n\nThe measure was the biggest revenue raiser in the Budget, forecast to generate \u00a33.1bn in the four years after its introduction, and is an extension of the rules introduced last year for self-employed workers in the public sector. According to the Treasury, these changes have resulted in an extra 58,000 individuals paying higher income tax and national insurance contributions in any given month.\n\nWorkers affected by the new regime could see their take-home pay drop significantly. Bookkeeping software company Pandle calculates that a self-employed contractor currently earning \u00a350,000 per year could see their net annual pay fall by almost \u00a36,000 after becoming an employee on the company payroll with extra tax and national insurance costs. A contractor on \u00a390,000 could see their net pay reduce by more than \u00a310,000.\n\nFinancial planners say the first step for anyone affected is to work out whether they are genuinely self-employed or not. HMRC\u2019s definition of self-employment hinges on the extent to which workers are taking financial risk, whether they have several contracts or rely on just one, and whether they can set their own working rules and the price they charge for their labour. But the definition is not clear cut.\n\nDawn Register, tax disputes partner at BDO, says the definition of what constitutes self employment is highly subjective. \u201cThe criteria is not clear cut,\u201d she says. \u201cThere have been a lot of cases [at tax tribunals] where one case is found to be self-employed, and another very similar one is found to be employed.\u201d\n\nA good starting point is HMRC\u2019s \u201cworking for yourself\u201d guide, which lists some definitions, and the HMRC online checker.\n\nThe next step is to check with the companies that hire you as to how they plan to approach the new rules. Come April 2020, the burden will rest with companies, and many of them might choose to err on the side of caution.\n\n\u201cSpeak to the companies you work for and test the water,\u201d says Ian Dyall, head of estate planning at Tilney, a wealth manager. \u201cThose workers on the ragged edge of being employed might choose to be employed instead of continue as a contractor, but there will be a financial impact.\u201d\n\nFaced with such a cut in income, it would be a wise move to clear debts and lock in a better mortgage deal in the run-up to the changes.\n\n\u201cYou should also negotiate a deal on your pension if you are going to become an employee,\u201d Mr Dyall says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the big advantages of being employed and a good way to mitigate tax, by paying more in.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Petronella West, chief executive of Investment Quorum, a wealth manager, adds: \u201cIt might be worth trying to look for other contracts so you can prove you aren\u2019t reliant on one source of income.\u201d\n\nGet ready for property changes\n\nBuy-to-let landlords have had little to cheer about in Budgets of the past few years, with a succession of tax crackdowns and new regulations choking off growth in the sector.\n\nNow so-called \u201caccidental landlords\u201d face a headache after Mr Hammond announced changes to the rules governing lettings relief. This tax break has been available to anyone who lets out a property that is \u2014 or has been \u2014 their primary residence. A maximum \u00a340,000 in lettings relief can be claimed against capital gains tax when the property is sold, rising to \u00a380,000 for a couple.\n\nFrom April 2020 \u2014 subject to a consultation \u2014 owners will only qualify for this relief if they occupy the home alongside the tenant. Scrapping the relief would bring in \u00a3150m by 2023-24, according to Treasury forecasts.\n\nUnder the current system, sellers receive CGT relief for the last 18 months that they own the property, but from 2020 this \u201cfinal period exemption\u201d could be halved to nine months.\n\nDavid Lawrenson, owner of property consultancy Letting Focus, says lettings relief has been ripe to be picked off by the Treasury. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively little known apart from by accountants and smart landlords and therefore quite a clever move by the chancellor. People will think: \u2018why did they get it anyway?\u2019 But it\u2019s quite a significant hit for amateur landlords.\u201d\n\nOnline interactive tax calculator Check your personal tax calculator for 2019-20\n\nConventional buy-to-let landlords will be little affected, since the relief is only available when a person\u2019s primary residence is rented out. But the changes would hit those who have been unable to sell their homes, and have decided to let their properties instead. As sales have slowed across swaths of the south in recent years, more owners have chosen this option.\n\nThe Budget was not devoid of good news for landlord investors, however, as the rise in personal income tax allowances \u2014 to \u00a312,500 for basic rate and \u00a350,000 for higher rate payers \u2014 could see some landlords at the margin become basic rate payers from April 2019, and thereby qualify for cheaper mortgage financing.\n\nAndrew Turner, chief executive at buy-to-let mortgage broker Commercial Trust Ltd, says: \u201cIf these landlords suddenly find themselves in the lower tax bracket from next April, they might benefit from more generous borrowing calculations on some buy-to-let products. This is because some lenders apply less strenuous rates in their income calculation ratio (ICR) assessments for non-tax payers and basic rate taxpayers.\u201d\n\nReporting by Josephine Cumbo, James Pickford, Kate Beioley, Lucy Warwick-Ching and Claer Barrett", "Alphaville is completely free.\n\nAll you have to do is register.\n\nReady to subscribe, View our subscription options", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "I am announcing that a grand jury in San Francisco has returned an indictment alleging economic espionage on the part of a Chinese state owned, government-owned company, a Taiwan company and three Taiwan individuals for an alleged scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, an Idaho-based semiconductor company.

Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nIndia has become the unexpected front line in the debate over the how much personal data governments and companies should be allowed to collect.\n\nThe country has seen a dramatic explosion in the amount of information generated by its citizens over the past decade.\n\nIndian consumers are flocking to digital services such as online shopping and movie downloads thanks to plunging data costs, while the government has built what has become the world\u2019s largest biometric identification system.\n\nOver the past 10 years more than 99 per cent of Indian adults \u2014 well over 1bn people \u2014 have been enrolled into the Aadhaar database, which contains their personal information as well as iris and fingerprint scans.\n\nThe government says this has revolutionised the efficiency of benefit claims and other state services while reducing fraud \u2014 although critics point to cases where some of the poorest Indians have been deprived of vital rations due to problems with the system.\n\nMeanwhile, a host of companies have made enthusiastic use of access to the high-tech system to sign up customers far more quickly and cheaply than in the past \u2014 from financial companies focused on low-income rural Indians, to Reliance Jio, a disruptive telecom operator that has signed up more than 200m users in its first two years.\n\nBut the system has been condemned by activists concerned that India is creating a surveillance state.\n\nA Bangalore-based retired judge challenged the Aadhaar system in court, arguing that it represented an intrusion to privacy and should be abolished.\n\nThe case went to India\u2019s supreme court, which ruled in September that companies were not permitted to use the Aadhaar system to verify customer identities, warning that this would \u201cenable commercial exploitation of . . . individual biometric and demographic information\u201d.\n\nCompanies in telecom and other sectors immediately started rushing to find other ways to verify customer identities. \u201cTo all intents and purposes, Aadhaar is now dead to us,\u201d says Rajan Mathews, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India.\n\nAdvocates of the Aadhaar system portray the court ruling as a temporary hiccup, however, and have urged the government to push through a new law that will permit private companies to regain access to the database. The government has not said whether it will do so, but finance minister Arun Jaitley underscored its commitment to Aadhaar after the court\u2019s ruling, saying: \u201cEveryone who has been criticising Aadhaar should understand that they cannot defy technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regulatory framework will now fall into place,\u201d asserts Sharad Sharma, co-founder of iSPIRT, a think-tank that has been a major cheerleader for Aadhaar. \u201cThere will be confusion for a month or two but then clarity for the next 10 to 15 years.\u201d\n\nThe permanent loss of private sector access to the data would damp the furious pace of growth in parts of India\u2019s digital economy, by pushing up the costs of customer addition, warns Jayanth Kolla, co-founder of consultancy Convergence Catalyst.\n\nThe supreme court ruling was part of a flurry of data security-related interventions this year by Indian institutions. In April, the Reserve Bank of India infuriated Visa and Mastercard by ordering that foreign payments companies would need to stop storing Indian customer data offshore.\n\nThe move \u201cis something that we haven\u2019t really seen anywhere else\u201d, says Porush Singh, south Asia president at Mastercard.\n\nA recent draft policy on ecommerce included a proposal to put similar restrictions on Amazon and other foreign online retailers. This came alongside a far more wide-reaching set of proposals delivered by a committee under a retired senior judge that recommended India lay down a set of individual rights around personal data, along similar lines to those mandated by the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nSome critics have warned, however, that these protections could be misused by corrupt officials trying to conceal wrongdoing. Others believe tighter rules are needed to ensure the government\u2019s collection of citizens\u2019 data does not enable creeping authoritarianism.\n\nRaman Jit Singh Chima, a lawyer and policy director at digital rights group Access Now, voices concern about the state\u2019s \u201cincreasing drive to track all types of data\u201d, while little is done to strengthen the controls around such activities.\n\nWhile fears of an emerging police state seem overblown, there are increasing concerns that personal data could be used by politicians to exploit caste or religious divisions in India\u2019s diverse society, says Sivarama Krishnan, India cyber security head for PwC.\n\nAmid all the fierce debate about data policy, he adds that a series of serious reported data breaches from public bodies and private companies makes clear the need for higher standards in general.\n\nMr Krishnan says: \u201cIndia needs to worry about the security of its technology infrastructure, inside or outside the government.\u201d\n\nRanjana Sonawne (centre) receiving the first Aadhaar card to be issued, in 2010", "What was mispronounced? Optional: help us by adding the time\n\nLondon was the obvious choice for Ian McGill to start his business, Spend Network. The subscription service, launched in 2010, collects public sector spending records of more than 300 bodies. Subscribers and the company\u2019s own researchers use this data to analyse the activities of government suppliers to help secure better deals in procurement.\n\nThe UK pioneered the movement to make such data more freely available. In 2010, in an effort to boost public trust in politics, the then prime minister David Cameron wrote to government departments asking them to open up their data to \u201cenable the public to hold politicians and public bodies to account\u201d.\n\nYet Mr McGill struggles to hide his frustration at the data\u2019s patchy quality. Public bodies in the UK are required to publish details of procurement contracts awarded but, he adds \u201cwe have seen only an handful of those contracts\u201d. Data is often incomplete, not standardised or has other serious quality flaws, says McGill.\n\nBehind the push for open data is a desire to make governments more transparent, accountable and efficient \u2014 but also to allow businesses to create products and services that spark economic development. The global annual opportunity cost of failing to do this effectively is about $5tn, according to one estimate from McKinsey, the consultancy.\n\nThe UK is not the only country falling short, says the Open Data Barometer, which monitors the status of government data across the world. Among the 30 leading governments \u2014 those that have championed the open data movement and have made progress over five years \u2014 \u201cless than a quarter of the data with the biggest potential for social and economic impact\u201d is truly open.\n\nThis goal of transparency, it seems, has not proved sufficient for \u201ccreating value\u201d \u2014 the movement\u2019s latest focus.\n\nIn 2015, nearly a decade after advocates first discussed the principles of open government data, 62 countries adopted the six Open Data Charter principles \u2014 which called for data to be open by default, usable and comparable.\n\nYet Carlos Iglesias, senior research manager at the Web Foundation, which campaigns for the provision of internet access as a basic right and runs the ODB, says global government data \u201cis usually incomplete, out of date, of low quality and fragmented\u201d.\n\nWhile most databases are easy to find and free to use, only half are available in a machine-readable format, the barometer\u2019s 2018 global report found. Of those, only one in four can be downloaded in bulk to be reused.\n\n1/4 Less than a quarter of the data among the initiative\u2019s 30 leading governments is truly open, according to the ODB\n\nThe new mantra among supporters of the initiative is \u201cpublish with a purpose\u201d, says Barbara Ubaldi, economist at the OECD, the Paris-based club of mostly rich nations.\n\nPrivate companies have a role to play here, too. Theresa May, the UK prime minister, proposed last month that certain companies disclose the pay gap between staff of different ethnicities \u2014 in a similar vein to the requirement to report gender pay, which came into effect in earlier this year.\n\nAnia Calderon, executive director at the Open Data Charter, says: \u201cSometimes the most valuable data is held by private companies and where there is the potential to create public value there is a role in government to play in legislating how that data should be made open.\u201d\n\nThe use of open data has already bore fruit for some countries. In 2015, Japan\u2019s ministry of land, infrastructure and transport set up an open data site aimed at disabled and elderly people. The 7,000 data points published are downloadable and the service can be used to generate a map that shows which passenger terminals on train, bus and ferry networksprovide barrier-free access.\n\nIn the US, The Climate Corporation, a digital agriculture company, combined 30 years of weather data and 60 years of crop yield data to help farmers increase their productivity. And in the UK, subscription service Land Insight merges different sources of land data to help individuals and developers compare property information, forecast selling prices, contact land owners and track planning applications.\n\nThe European Commission estimated the market value of open data in the EU in 2016 at close to \u20ac200bn \u2014 with a projection of up to \u20ac285bn by 2020.\n\nVarious monitors are trying to assess impact in different ways. The OECD tracks government efforts in supporting the reuse of data among individuals, NGOs and private companies, explains Ms Ubaldi. Both the ODB and the European Commission trackers, meanwhile, measure apps and services created using government data, and their political, social and economic value.\n\nNew seams of data are helping to create new businesses, with some countries performing better than others.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s data policy has helped the nation create an active business ecosystem. Ms Calderon says it is \u201cfocused exclusively on companies developing services . . . [using] data that they produce\u201d.\n\nOpen Data 500, an international network of organisations that studies the use and impact of open data, reveals that private companies in South Korea are using government agency data, with technology, advertising and business services among the biggest users.\n\nIt shows, for example, that Archidraw, a four-year-old Seoul-based company that provides 3D visualisation tools for interior design and property remodelling, has used mapping data from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.\n\nGermany lags behind on most assessments as the move towards open data was carried out at state level with little national co-ordination, but it has pushed ahead with legislation. The country\u2019s open data law came into effect last summer, but the requirement to publish data within two years applies only to public authorities subject to the federal government, and excludes Germany\u2019s regional authorities.\n\nSuch legislation is something the UK lacks, says Jeni Tennison, chief executive of the Open Data Institute, co-founded by inventor of the internet Sir Tim Berners-Lee to promote the use of open data worldwide. \u201cThere is no legislation that forces a public sector department to update their open data or to produce it to a certain quality.\u201d\n\nMr McGill agrees: \u201cThe regulation is there but not the checks. It\u2019s like having a speed limit, but no police on the road and no monitoring.\u201d\n\nBetter-quality open data could help unlock an annual $3.2tn-$5.4tn in economic value globally across seven sectors, according to a study by McKinsey, and includes transportation, consumer finance and healthcare.\n\nThe UK is among those that could do much more to bridge this gap, Mr McGill believes. \u201cThere are large potentials in the UK [from better open government data] that are simply not met,\u201d he says.\n\nWith open data\u2019s leading governments treating the initiative as a \u201cside project\u201d, in the words of the ODB, it will be some while yet before its full economic potential is realised.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more."]
