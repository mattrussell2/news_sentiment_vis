Faux American bollocks,\u201d said Catherine McGregor, a former military officer, on social media.\n\nMany former soldiers agreed and criticised Virgin Australia\u2019s plan to provide veterans with priority boarding and US-style onboard salutes, whereby former or current members of the military are acknowledged on flights.\n\nThe proposal, which is now being reviewed by Virgin, follows a campaign by media group News Corp Australia under the hashtag #ThanksForServing, which aims to encourage Australians to honour servicemen and women. It is supported by Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, who launched a lapel pin and veterans\u2019 card last week that provides discounts on various goods and services for veterans.\n\n\u201cI think we are in danger of reaching peak veteran,\u201d said Rodger Shanahan, a former military officer who is now an analyst at the Lowy Institute, a think-tank.\n\nHe criticises what he views as importing US traditions, arguing that many Australian veterans consider these plans as trite, embarrassing and putting them on an impossibly high pedestal. It ignores other essential services, including police, healthcare workers and other emergency service personnel, he added.\n\nFor some Australians, such idolising of veterans cuts across the country\u2019s egalitarian culture and mantra of providing everyone with a \u201cfair go\u201d. For others, the offer of priority flights and public salutes smacks of tokenism when discounts on flights or more money spent on mental health services for veterans would be more welcome.\n\nWartime commemoration is important in Australia, where the deaths of so many young soldiers shortly after the country became independent in 1901 helped forge a national identity. But by the 1970s, the \u201cAnzac spirit\u201d had lost its lustre following Australia\u2019s participation in the Vietnam war. Peter Weir\u2019s 1981 movie Gallipoli and various other campaigns have over the past three decades again placed veterans at the centre of the country\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cThe first world war has long been seen as the baptismal font of Australian nationalism. It\u2019s a guilt-free myth about Australian fortitude and courage, which doesn\u2019t raise questions about European foundation of Australian settlement,\u201d said James Curran, professor of history at University of Sydney.\n\nHe warns that dewy-eyed sentimentalism and pumped-up patriotism risk becoming a national sedative, which obscures other more complicated aspects of Australian history, including European settlement.\n\nSince coming to power in 2013 the conservative Liberal-National government has enthusiastically embraced the four-year long centenary of the first world war, spending an estimated A$600m on commemorative events, museums and memorials at home and abroad. This is at least three times more than any other nation, according to Honest History, a group founded to re-evaluate the Anzac myth as the spiritual birth of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe problem with such relentless commemoration is that children start to see war and military service as an inevitable part of being Australian,\u201d said David Stephens, secretary of Honest History.\n\nThe recent announcement of an extra A$500m over 10 years to expand the war memorial in Canberra has prompted renewed questions about whether the money could be better spent.\n\n\u201cThe A$500m funding to the war memorial came as a surprise to veterans\u2019 groups,\u201d said James Brown, president of the Returned and Services League in New South Wales. \u201cThere is no doubt it does great work but it points to an imbalance in funding towards commemoration, especially when you consider 85 veterans committed suicide last year.\u201d\n\nHe wants more funding directed to mental health support and warns against companies and politicians using veterans as a \u201cprop\u201d for their own interests.\n\nThe government has rejected these complaints, arguing that the annual spending on the memorial was less than 1 per cent of the department of veteran\u2019s affairs\u2019 A$11bn annual budget.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that commemorative activities can help with recovery for some veterans experiencing mental health issues and I would argue that we took too long as a nation to properly recognise Vietnam veterans,\u201d said Darren Chester, Australia\u2019s minister for veterans\u2019 affairs.", "New to the Financial Times?\n\nEnjoy 7 days of free access with a Guest Pass", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "We use cookies for a number of reasons, such as keeping FT Sites reliable and secure, personalising content and ads, providing social media features and to analyse how our Sites are used.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

I am comparing tech to any other addictive substance, be it tobacco, alcohol. One NYU professor has looked and found that about 41% of adults in America are suffering from addictive behaviours having to do with their phone. Literally we are swiping and unswiping our iPhones 130 times a day. There's a Harvard-trained psychologist that's done some research showing that voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, which are even more persuasive than, say, looking at your phone, can shift people's purchasing decisions and even their voting patterns by up to 80%.\n\nTechidemic, I'm going to coin a new word. I think that this is an epidemic. So if you just look at a standard iPhone here, I can very quickly check my email. I can open up the weather app. I can open up Google Maps. I can open up and buy music on demand. But there is nothing that is transparently easy for me to shut down. And that's the whole point, because technology firms by and large are trying to monetize your attention.\n\nOne of the interesting side effects, and possibly quite a profitable side effect of all of this is that certain companies, companies like Apple, for example, or IBM, are starting to see privacy, thoughtfulness, control as a competitive advantage that they can leverage in their own products. So Apple, for example, recently announced some changes to its system and to its handsets that allow you more control over your own settings. This would mean a change in the business model so that companies would no longer be attention merchants, let's say, but they would be facilitators. And I think that as people become more aware of the addictive properties of technology, the companies that do that are going to see their sales increase.\n\nThere is a conversation in the US going on right now about whether we should have a kind of a Food and Drug Administration of technology. In Europe, you see a very robust conversation around privacy. And I think the next beat in that will be about control over technology, and we need to take back control.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

But the president of France is looking to the future as well as the past. Mr Macron issued invitations to more than 60 world leaders to mark the centenary in Paris. France has used the commemoration to launch a Paris peace forum under the slogan, \"peace is linked with global governance.\"\n\nBut this mild message is unlikely to sit well with Donald Trump, who is an avowed enemy of global governance. The US president recently told the UN:\n\nWe will never surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy.\n\nMr Macron and Mr Trump represent two different traditions of thought about international politics, which clashed 100 years ago in Paris. Mr Macron's the heir to the high minded internationalism of Woodrow Wilson, the US president who personally represented America at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. It was Wilson who set up 14 points to frame a new world order, and who wanted a League of Nations.\n\nThe League was to be a new form of global governance to end all wars. But Wilson's ambitious plans were shot down at home. The US Senate refused to approve American membership of the League of Nations, which went ahead without US participation. The opposition was led by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, who explained, \"I must think of the United States first,\" and said \"internationalism is to me repulsive.\"\n\nA hundred years later, the US now has a president who stands firmly in the tradition of Lodge, proclaiming America first, and proudly calling himself a nationalist.\n\nWe reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.\n\nThe peace efforts of 1918 and '19 failed, and war returned to Europe 20 years later. But internationalists like Mr Macron and nationalists such as Mr Trump drew very different lessons from that failure. For nationalists, the failure of the League of Nations has become a byword for the futility of global governance. In the 1930s, the league was totally unable to act as an effective check on the ambitions of imperial Japan, Mussolini's Italy, and Nazi Germany. In the end, it took the armies of nation states to stop the dictators.\n\nBut the internationalist response was that the really serious mistake was made by the likes of Senator Lodge. By snubbing the league and retreating into America-first isolationism, the US arguably created the conditions for international anarchy to flourish. So there it is. Trump v Macron, nationalism v internationalism. This is a debate that's even more about the future than the past. Which of these two ideologies will prevail? Come back to Paris in 100 years' time, and perhaps we'll learn.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "With an unmatched number of scoops, Brexit has become our most read and commented-on topic since the referendum.

Will Mrs May survive?", "Lionel, we had a momentous evening. The Democrats won the House. The Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate. Donald Trump today said it was a tremendous success. How should we view what happened in America?\n\nIt's a tremendous exercise in American democracy. We had a vote. People turned out in great numbers, in many states.\n\nAnd the Democrats, as you say, took control of the House of Representatives. They hoped for more. I think they were always stretching a bit, to think they could get a majority in the Senate. They took a bit of a bloody nose, there, and they missed out some big races.\n\nBut, overall, I think that it's a sort of half-and-half. It's neither a great success for the Republicans nor for Mr Trump or the Democrats.\n\nLooking at the results, did you have a sense of what this means for 2020? Do we think Donald Trump is going to be in a stronger or weaker position? Or did we learn anything that will give us a sense of how he might try and capture the White House again in 2020?\n\nHe will have been encouraged by the way in which the Republicans took Florida. That was a very - they thought Florida would be competitive, the Democrats, but, in the end, a Republican candidate won. And also an important win for Ted Cruz - no fan, no friend of Mr Trump, but he won. He retained his seat against Beta O'Rourke, who's the new, big coming force Democrat in Texas.\n\nIn the Midwest, I think there was more encouraging signs for the Democrats in Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan. Which is interesting, because that's the sort of industrial heartland which Mr Trump sees as his base.\n\nNow, we also had a lot of women who were successful. We had some first two female Muslim members of Congress. We've new groups who are entering Congress, and some very, very young people, for the first time. How do you think the complexion of Congress is going to change?\n\nWell, I think the women factor is a big one. I mean, there may not have been a blue wave, but there was a women's wave. And that will change. And I think that's maybe also a bit of the kind of MeToo movement, the fact that women feel that they should be taking the highest office. They didn't get the presidency, but in Congress they're much better representatives. It's more diverse.\n\nSo really the question is, how much change? Nancy Pelosi wants to rerun again as Speaker of the House of Representatives. She's got a lot of experienced veterans around her, so not so much change there.\n\nOn the other hand, the Republicans have got a bigger majority in the Senate. Some new figures, some interesting figures, there.\n\nSo let me just ask you one last question. Around the world, a lot of people will be looking at the results of the election and asking, will anything change in the Trump administration, in terms of how the president deals with the rest of the world, based on what happened in the midterm elections? Do you think we're going to see anything different?\n\nWell, I don't see a kind of 1986, which is when I first came to Washington and Reagan lost. He lost control of the Senate in '86. But they managed to do - they'd just done a tax bill, big tax-reform bill.\n\nI don't see that kind of bipartisanship in Washington. What I do see is Mr Trump, probably when faced with the House, possibly an aggressive House looking to subpoena his tax records, still got the Russian investigation to come, he's going to turn increasingly to foreign policy. And I think that's a very aggressive policy on Iran, quite confrontational with China, and a lot of aggressive bilateralism. So - the same, but a bit more, from Mr Trump.\n\nIf I could just ask you, just on China, we've spent some time talking to China experts and officials around Washington. What do you think the Chinese should expect, in terms of Donald Trump, from here on in? And is it possible for the US and China to come a little bit closer together on some of these contentious issues, whether it's trade or national security issues?\n\nWell, my sense is Mr Trump, President Trump, thinks he's really got the hang of this office, the office of the presidency. He's quite good at it. He can take a bit of advice but not too much advice. He thinks he's got China's number.\n\nIt's been striking, Demetri, as we've had our conversations, the way in which there's a sort of spring in the step of senior officials who think, you know, we're on the right side of history. Actually, they're going to call out the Chinese on intellectual property theft. We're going to call them out on their missile programme. We're going to put them under pressure. And they're a little bit rattled, and no problem with that.\n\nNow, it's not anywhere near as aggressive as on Iran, but I think you're going to get more of the same, plus, on China policy. Because they're going to make China sweat a bit in order to extract more concessions.\n\nAnd make China drink a little bit of its own medicine, maybe.\n\nA little bit. I mean, they definitely - it's going to be hard bargaining. But I think the other point is, this isn't just a trade issue. This is about a rising power which is expanding, expanding its influence. We've heard a lot about expansion, aggressive expansion, of soft power, co-opting academics. And then the hard power, which you're seeing projection of power in the Pacific - the East China Sea, South China Sea.

That battle is expected to come to an end soon, despite a delay announced by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBoth these villagers and Palestinian leaders expect Israeli bulldozers to demolish these few dozen huts. That would bring an end to a nearly half-century standoff between Jewish settlers and Arab villagers in the West Bank.\n\nThis tiny, dusty village has catapulted onto the global stage because of one simple fact, its location. Planted between two illegal Israeli settlements, Kfar Adumin, and Ma'ale Adumin, its very existence jeopardises expansion of Israeli infrastructure in the West Bank. Full Israeli control of this land would separate Ramallah and Bethlehem, the two largest Palestinian cities. If successful, it would dash the hopes of a viable Palestinian nation. Life here has always been difficult, even before the bulldozers. We visited in late August, when the villagers waited for a final Israeli Supreme Court ruling.\n\nResidents described the decades spent in anticipation and fear.\n\nThe root of the problem is exactly 25 years old. In September, 1993, Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords. They were designed to transfer the powers and responsibilities of the Israeli military occupation to the Palestinian authorities. But until that happens, some two-thirds of the West Bank are administered fully by the Israeli military. And some 99 per cent of building requests by Arabs are rejected. Meanwhile, some 400,000 Jews have been given permission to build vast, sprawling settlements. Under international law, the settlements are illegal. Under Israeli law, Khan al Ahmar is illegal.\n\nThe conversion of this area into a suburb of Jerusalem requires these two settlements, Kfar Adumin and Ma'ale Adumin, to continue growing. With the village demolished, the development plans will eventually allow these two areas to merge together. And if Israel annexes the land, it will also encircle the remaining Arab parts of East Jerusalem.\n\nThe settlers at Kfar Adumin were helped in their quest for expansion by Regavim, an NGO that took the case all the way to the Supreme Court with a very simple argument, the village was built without permission, and thus it should be demolished.\n\nThis one small patch actually sits on a junction that will bisect the country, north-south, east-west - it's right in a critical spot. When the Oslo Accords actually stated that the final decisions about this area should be reached through negotiation between the two sides. And the activity that we've seen by the Palestinian Authority has actually emptied those accords of all content, because they have, without negotiation, illegally, and in contravention of the Oslo Accords, built without building permits and without any planning. And this is state land. And the state of Israel, either as an occupier or as a sovereign, is the only authority who can and should issue building permits in this area.\n\nThe Bedouin villagers have fought back against this with help from their European partners, who helped build them a school for their children. Which meant they didn't have to brave the highway to catch buses to schools far away. And to make sure the school didn't need a building permit, they built it out of rubber tyres.\n\nThe Bedouin villagers tried, and eventually failed, to get an Israeli court to back them. Their lawyer for nearly a decade, Shlomo Lecker, says Israeli politics ended up trumping the human rights of the Arab villagers.\n\nPeople should have the same rights. And there's absolutely no reason why they are mistreated the way they are, to live in the way they live now, in shacks without infrastructure, without the right to build schools, and to make choices in their life. What does it matter, 30 families, to the whole picture? But it became a symbol, and an important symbol, to the intentions of both sides. And what will happen there may have an effect on reality.\n\nKhan al Ahmar is a first Bedouin village to be demolished in years. Settlers intend to use this ruling as a precedent for Palestinians who are now facing the most hostile US and Israeli administration in generations. Losing that land to settlers would mean only one thing, losing a viable Palestinian nation.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "New to the Financial Times?\n\nEnjoy 7 days of free access with a Guest Pass", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.", "Gain access to global coverage from local journalists on the ground in 50+ countries working around the clock to break news, analyze, spot risks and opportunities.\n\nJoin over 300,000 Finance professionals who already subscribe to the FT.", "The next governor of Colorado.\n\nAnd I pledge to serve all Coloradans no matter your party, no matter where you live, no matter your race, or no matter your gender.
