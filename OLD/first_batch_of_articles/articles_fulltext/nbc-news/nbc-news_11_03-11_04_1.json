I graduated as a computer technician and not even with a degree have I been able to find work,\" he said of life in his home country.\n\nIn his desperation to flee, Chavez was one of the many people who crossed a river from Guatemala into Mexico, defying authorities deployed to patrol that country's southern frontier.\n\nIt remained to be seen if the main group will now continue directly north through Veracruz to the closest U.S. border, or veer slightly westward and make a stop in the country's capital.\n\nThe capital could serve as a better launching pad for reaching a broader array of destinations along the U.S. border. They could also receive additional support, although Mexican officials have appeared conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journeys.\n\nMexico now faces the unprecedented situation of having three caravans stretched over 300 miles (500 kilometers) of highway in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca and Veracruz, with a total of more than 6,000 migrants.\n\nOn Friday, a caravan from El Salvador waded over the Suchiate River into Mexico, bringing 1,000 to 1,500 people who want to reach the U.S. border.\n\nThat caravan initially tried to cross the bridge between Guatemala and Mexico, but Mexican authorities told them they would have to show passports and visas and enter in groups of 50 for processing.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 to 1,500 people, entered Mexico earlier this week and is now in Chiapas. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nThe first, largest group of mainly Honduran migrants entered Mexico on Oct.19.\n\nImmigration agents and police have at times detained migrants in the smaller caravans. But several mayors have rolled out the welcome mat for migrants who reached their towns \u2014 arranging for food and camp sites.\n\nMexico's Interior Department says nearly 3,000 of the migrants in the first caravan have applied for refuge in Mexico and hundreds more have returned home.\n\nWith or without the government's help, uncertainty awaits.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans. More than 7,000 active duty troops have been told to deploy to Texas, Arizona and California ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHe plans to sign an order next week that could lead to the large-scale detention of migrants crossing the southern border and bar anyone caught crossing illegally from claiming asylum.", "Meet the Press: November 4, 2018 copied!\n\nA special 2018 midterm edition of Meet the Press with Sen.

He was unable to provide any additional details.\n\nSusan Jane Westwood turned herself into police a week after she was recorded on tape harassing two black women in a North Carolina apartment complex.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Ben Kamisar\n\nWith Election Day just two days away, both the candidates and major party committees are gearing up for a historic midterm that will provide the first major referendum on President Donald Trump's first two years in office.\n\nDemocrats appear to poised to make big gains in the House, challenging in many GOP-held seats. But it's unclear whether they will be able to win the 23 seats they need to take control of the House.\n\nRepublicans are hoping a favorable map in the Senate can help weather the storm and give their party something to crow about when the dust settles.\n\nAnd both sides are competing furiously in governors races, where more than half are up for grabs.\n\nHistoric levels of enthusiasm on both sides of the aisle, confirmed by a brand new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, are complicating the forecasting, leaving both sides anxiously awaiting Tuesday's results.\n\nIn the final \"Meet the Press\" before Tuesday, anchor Chuck Todd peppered politicians and analysts about how they see the election shaking out.\n\nHere's a glimpse at their thoughts on the three major battlefields.\n\nThe House\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report's list of competitive races paints the picture of a historically large battlefield in the House, with dozens of Republican incumbents playing serious defense.\n\nThe new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Democrats heading into the final weekend with a clear edge among likely voters, but what's unclear is how that edge will play out in individual races.\n\nDemocrats have a 7-point edge in the generic ballot, as 50 percent of likely voters said they'd prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress. Forty-three percent of those voters said they'd prefer a Republican majority in Congress.\n\nDemocrats are performing best with minorities, young voters, college-educated voters and women. Republicans score best with white voters without a college degree, men and white voters.\n\nThe stark differences among voting blocs underscores the importance of the mobilization efforts done by the parties to bring their most reliable voters to the polls.\n\nDemocrats have spent tens of millions of dollars looking to boost minority turnout, while President Donald Trump and his allies have crisscrossed the country to juice enthusiasm among the voters that helped him win the White House in 2016.\n\nDemocratic pollster Cornell Belcher, a guest on the \"Meet the Press\" panel, said that while Republicans have historically been better at turning out their base during midterm elections, that the president's calculus may not ultimately pay off thanks to how voters view him.\n\nBelcher pointed to the NBC/Wall Street Journal's finding that more voters want to send a message that Trump and the GOP need a \"check and balance\" in Congress, than those who want to give Trump more allies in Congress.\n\n\"The president's job disapproval right now really means something,\" Belcher added.\n\nBut to Hugh Hewitt, the GOP conservative pundit and Salem Radio Network host, the new polling shows a bright spot for Republicans \u2014 the economy.\n\n\"Seventy four percent of people think their own personal economics are good. That is a remarkable thing,\" Hewitt said. \"Do you vote to keep the economy humming or do you vote against President Trump?\"\n\nThe Senate\n\nUnlike the House, where Republicans are playing defense in districts where Trump isn't too popular, the Senate map runs right through states Trump won easily, and sometimes overwhelmingly, in 2016.\n\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, admitted on \"Meet the Press\" that \"it's a very different sort of political battlefield in Senate races than House races.\"\n\nBut he praised his candidates for building their own personal brands in their home states and said there's still a \"narrow path\" for a Democratic Senate majority.\n\nEven as polls show North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp trailing Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer in the wake of her decision to vote against Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, Van Hollen cautioned that \"no one should ever count Heidi Heitkamp out.\" He also called Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, locked in a tight race against Republican Attorney General Josh Hawley, as a \"fighter.\"\n\nThe weakness of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, whose bribery charges ended with a hung jury, has inserted uncertainty into the Democrats already difficult map. But Van Hollen said he's \"confident Bob Menendez will win,\" criticizing Republican Bob Hugin's past as a pharmaceutical company head.\n\nOne surprising battleground has been Tennessee, where popular former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen remains better-liked than Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn but still trails at the polls.\n\nVan Hollen said Bredesen is \"pragmatic\" and willing to work with Trump to help Tennessee. But Tennessee Republican Gov. Phil Haslam, the head of the Republican Governors Association, espoused confidence about Blackburn's campaign and argued that Tennessee voters have been mobilized to vote for Republicans after the Kavanaugh confirmation.\n\n\"Marsha Blackburn has run a really good race,\" he said. \"The color of the jersey you're wearing up there is really important. And I don't know exactly. But I think the Kavanaugh hearings had a 5 or 6-point swing in Tennessee. I personally think Marsha will by at least that much.\"\n\nGovernors\n\nThe gubernatorial races could prove to be true wildcards.\n\nRepublican incumbents are poised to cruise in blue states like Vermont, Maryland and Massachusetts. But Democrats are giving conservative Republicans tough challenges in red states like Oklahoma, Georgia and Kansas.\n\nHaslam credited that uncertainty to an electorate that looks at these elections through a less partisan lens than through which they view federal elections.\n\n\"People look at the practical aspects of electing a governor,\" he said.\n\n\"Who's going to create jobs here? Who's going to produce the best schools? And who's going to run our state's budget in a way that works? And so it's a lot different decision voting for your governor than it is for your senator, and definitely than it is for your House member.\"\n\nAlong those lines, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Stacey Abrams argued that her background will help her become the first Democratic governor since 2003.\n\nPushing back against Trump's recent criticism of her qualifications, Abrams said she is the \"most qualified candidate\" in her race against Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp.\n\n\"I am a business owner, a tax attorney who trained at Yale Law School. I am a civic leader who helped register more than 200,000 Georgians. I am a very accomplished political leader who worked across the aisle to improve access to education, transportation, and I blocked the single largest tax increase in Georgia history,\" she said.\n\n\"There is no one more qualified standing for this office in Georgia.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The song transformed the debate over Drake from a musical into a moral one, threatening to obliterate a self-actualization narrative that Drake had been building for more than a decade.\n\nBut while \u201cThe Story of Adidon\u201d could have been the asteroid that pushed Drake\u2019s career into a nosedive, he turned it into a footnote. This year, Drake has racked up three Billboard No. 1 hits and a platinum album, \u201cScorpion,\u201d starred in unforgettable music videos, dropped pristine guest verses and ignited viral dance crazes.\n\nDrake has racked up three Billboard number-one hits and a platinum album, \u201cScorpion,\u201d starred in unforgettable music videos, dropped pristine guest verses and ignited viral dance crazes.\n\nThe artist\u2019s banner year has been cemented this fall by \u201cMia,\u201d Drake\u2019s Spanish-language collaboration with Bad Bunny that cruised into the Billboard Hot 100's top five this week. The song shows him to be a chameleon with Godzilla proportions \u2014 a man who mimics, absorbs and then shifts the pop paradigm in one fell swoop. And if you still cling to the perception that Drake is nothing more than a toothless cornball, you need to pay more attention. \u201cMia\u201d is the cherry on top of one of the greatest individual years in pop music of all time.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to prove Drake\u2019s 2018 dominance by the numbers. When Drake\u2019s fifth album \u201cScorpion\u201d was released in June, he broke single-day streaming records on Apple Music and Spotify and was the first artist to have their album pass 1 billion streams in its first week. He broke the record for most songs simultaneously in the top 10 of Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 (seven) and the top 100 (27). And \u201cMia\u201d is his 12th song to crack the top 10 this year, pushing him past the Beatles for the most in a single year.\n\n\u201cScorpion\u201d received far less love from critics, who felt that the album fell short in the context of several expectations: that Drake would use it to respond to Pusha, evolve sonically, and create a conceptually cohesive project following the wandering bloat of 2016\u2019s \u201cViews\u201d and 2017\u2019s \u201cMore Life.\u201d That he failed to achieve any of the three made the album easy to dismiss for some reviewers.\n\nThe whole may have been a bit scattershot, but many of the individual songs were clinically brilliant. It\u2019s likely that someone told you that they only loved their bed and their mama this summer. It\u2019s even more likely you heard the springy bounce of \u201cIn My Feelings\u201d relentlessly blasting from moving cars, boomboxes and stadium sound systems. B-side tracks like \u201cNonstop\u201d and \u201cMob Ties\u201d stormed charts across the world before even getting released as singles, with LeBron James gushing over the latter in a recent episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Shop.\u201d And \u201cNice For What,\u201d the album\u2019s crown jewel, may be one of the best Drake songs of all time, with even Lauryn Hill signaling her approval by flipping back her own sample in concert.\n\nDrake knew that many critics wanted a certain structure and narrative, but he ignored them: \u201cN----- want a classic, that\u2019s just ten of these,\u201d he rapped on \u201cSandra\u2019s Rose.\u201d He was right. \u201cScorpion\u201d thrives precisely because it doesn\u2019t conform to the platonic ideal of the album, which was originally conceptualized because of physical constraints. \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d captivated audiences in 1973 in part because of the listener\u2019s forced captivity \u2014 there\u2019s no skip button on a vinyl record.\n\n\u201cScorpion,\u201d on the other hand, isn\u2019t really meant to be listened all at once. Drake understands that the modern structure is more fungible, and that people will listen in bunches or on shuffle; as part of playlists, videos, memes, workouts or barbecues. In its flexibility and ambivalent attitude toward itself, \u201cScorpion\u201d feels like the first masterwork of the streaming era.\n\nOther artists on Drake\u2019s level, like Adele, Taylor Swift and Beyonce, operate on strict album cycles, in which they descend from the heavens once every few years to bestow a neatly packaged product before vanishing again. But Drake has done the exact opposite, making cameos in a dizzying array of musical contexts.\n\nHe took victory lap verses with fellow rap royalty on 2 Chainz and Quavo's \u201cBetter Than You\u201d and Quavo\u2019s \u201cFlip The Switch,\u201d and supercharges Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cSicko Mode,\u201d one of the most formally inventive songs of the year. On Lil Baby and Gunna\u2019s \u201cNever Recover\u201d and Blocboy JB\u2019s \u201cLook Alive,\u201d Drake reinforces his hunger to help facilitate rap\u2019s future by treating three of the genre\u2019s fastest rising stars as his equals. He sounds invigorated by their youth while asserting his own supremacy through unrelenting volleys of syllables.\n\nDrake understands that in 2018, rap\u2019s outer blade is just pop\u2019s next doughy center; he wields the power to both predict a young superstar\u2019s rise while simultaneously helping to propel it. This ability is especially meaningful when it comes to \u201cMia,\u201d his collaboration with Bad Bunny. Drake is far from the first Western star to turn his eyes to Latin America; Justin Bieber, Demi Lovato and others have already walked that path.\n\nBut while some of those have felt like interlopers, Drake\u2019s presence on \u201cMia\u201d feels natural \u2014 his gliding syllables fit the beat snugly, and the lilting melody is so, well, Drake-ian. And while Bad Bunny doesn\u2019t need much of a lift \u2014 he already went No. 1 this year on Cardi B and J Balvin's \u201cI Like It\u201d \u2014 \u201cMia\u201d is irrevocable proof of Latin trap\u2019s ascendance into the American mainstream.\n\nWhile some might be cynical about these forays into foreign territory, Drake has time and time again proved his commitment to the idea that modern pop music is inherently global. He sang in Spanish with Romeo Santos in 2014 and has constantly drawn from Caribbean rhythms in songs like \u201cPassionfruit\u201d and \u201cOne Dance;\" he\u2019s a Toronto emcee that has diligently worked to become fluent in London grime, Jamaican dancehall and Houston chopped and screwed tempos. This year, Drake broke records, rewrote structural norms and united the edges of music across the globe. In the process, he's become the North Star in the pop constellation.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Benjy Sarlin\n\nAPEX, N.C. \u2014 The top of the blue wave approached a friendly suburban town on a beautiful afternoon as Democratic candidate Linda Coleman, 69, campaigned for Congress last week at a community college by a row of fresh pastel townhouses.\n\n\"I hope you'll vote for me, Linda Coleman,\" she said to voter after voter in a melodious drawl as they lined up at an early voting site.\n\nIf they stopped to talk, Coleman, a former state legislator, county commissioner and two-time nominee for lieutenant governor, would keep her pitch tight: \"Health care, education, jobs\" is her motto. She deliberately avoids bringing up President Donald Trump, who she said was a \"non-factor.\" Nearby signs for her opponent, three-term GOP Rep. George Holding, simply read \"conservative.\"\n\nChances are high you haven't heard much about this race. Neither of the candidates is a charismatic viral sensation or a fiery ideologue raising huge cash from small donors.\n\nColeman is an experienced politician, but she is more excited to talk about her career overseeing human resources at state agencies. Holding is a self-described \"boring tax lawyer\" and former federal prosecutor with a passion for fiscal policy. When they debated last week, the local newspaper's headline was about how mild-mannered each was. Holding even defended Coleman from an outside group's attack ad.\n\n\"The fact that he's a generic Republican is probably what stands out about him,\" Jonathan Kappler, a political analyst for state businesses at the North Carolina Free Enterprise Foundation, told NBC News. \"When she was the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in 2012 and 2016, she kind of performed like a generic Democrat.\"\n\nRep. George Holding, R-N.C., at a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Cabinet Room of the White House on July 17. Andrew Harnik / AP\n\nIn other words, it's an utterly unremarkable race \u2014 which makes it a fascinating test of the 2018 Democratic wave.\n\nThat's because, in this district, the \"generic Democrat\" facing the \"generic Republican\" shouldn't be able to win this seat.\n\nNorth Carolina's 2nd Congressional District was drawn by Republican lawmakers in one of the most notoriously gerrymandered states to favor their side in good times and bad. The lines changed in 2016 after courts ruled that they had discriminated against black voters, but Trump still won the district by almost 10 points, and Holding won by more than 13 points.\n\nYet, somehow, despite lacking any of the excitement or intrigue of other races, it's become a premier contest, albeit a quiet one. Outside groups on both sides, including the Congressional Leadership Fund, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Women Vote, have poured in over $3 million to influence the outcome, according to OpenSecrets, the database of political contributions maintained by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThis is what can happen in a potential wave: Seats that aren't on anyone's radar suddenly become a race. In addition to this district, Republican-allied groups have thrown late cash into seats like Georgia's 6th, South Carolina's 1st and Michigan's 6th, all of which were once expected to be safe. The Democratic map has expanded to encompass about 100 plausible targets, easily the most for either party since the 2010 Republican tsunami.\n\nBut if the map is wide, it's also shallow. There are few seats Democrats have clearly put away and lots of seats like Holding's where they have an outside shot at victory if the wave is big enough. If the national vote breaks from current polls by just two or three points in either direction, dozens of seats could break with it.\n\n\"We're a really good weather vane for how good a night the Democrats will have nationally,\" said former Democratic strategist Mac McCorkle, a public policy professor at Duke University.\n\nAs is the case for many Democrats, Coleman's path to victory runs through upscale suburbs like Apex, a booming community near Raleigh that was named the nicest place to live in America by Money Magazine three years ago. It's towns like this where voters, especially women, have turned the strongest against Republicans in recent elections.\n\n\"In previous years, I leaned more Republican, but we may need more of a change this time,\" Dulce Garcia, 21, said as she waited in line to vote, where she was still undecided. \"I just don't agree with what's been going on.\u201d\n\nPolitical observers say the area has also seen a flood of newcomers from blue states, which may make the race more competitive this year. Terry Kaufman, 61, said she and her husband, both \"born and bred Democrats\" who are voting for Coleman, arrived recently from California.\n\n\"We moved here sight unseen,\" Kaufman said. \"My husband just went online and decided the Raleigh area was the place to live.\"\n\nLinda Coleman discusses her campaign during an interview in Apex, N.C., on Oct. 30. Caitlin Penna / for NBC News\n\nBut there's still a strong local split between liberals and conservatives, and several voters said they were reluctant to bring up politics for fear of offending co-workers and neighbors.\n\n\"The Democrats, not so much at the state level but nationally, are ludicrous,\" said Michael Meade, 74. \"I don't want to live in a socialist country.\"\n\nEven in a potentially tough cycle for Republicans, Holding was considered safe compared to two other GOP-held seats, in the 9th and 13th districts. But Holding announced to his supporters in late August that he was losing in an internal poll. Coleman said her own polls showed a similar race, and a public survey sponsored by the Civitas Institute, a conservative group based in the state, soon found Holding down by 1, as well. That prompted alarm bells from Republicans, who worried that Holding hadn't taken the race seriously enough.\n\n\"The old saying goes, you run two ways: scared or unopposed,\" Civitas President Donald Bryson said. \"Holding wasn't running scared, and he wasn't running unopposed.\"\n\nSoon outside money was swooping in to fund attacks against both sides.\n\nThe topics are similar to those in other races, which makes the district a good test of party messaging. Coleman and her allies are going after Holding for his votes to repeal President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act and weaken its protections for pre-existing conditions and for not holding town halls. Holding and his supporters have attacked Coleman for supporting \"sanctuary cities,\" where local authorities have a policy of not cooperating with immigration authorities in some circumstances, and for voting to raise taxes in the state Legislature.\n\nColeman told NBC News that the immigration attacks were \"fear-mongering,\" but they may have taken a toll. A new Civitas poll last week found Holding back up by 9 points despite trailing the previous month.\n\nBoth sides have made some nods to moderates.

He said the commercial was \"a good example of broken politics.\"\n\nColeman hasn't signed on to Democratic proposals for single-payer health care and said she wants to focus on bipartisan negotiations, instead, because \"I don\u2019t think that any one group will have all the answers.\"\n\nAs Coleman elaborated on her positions from a bench outside the polling site, Garcia, the Republican-leaning voter who had been torn between candidates, stopped by to say that she had made up her mind, but she wanted to keep her vote secret.\n\nThat was encouraging enough for Coleman, who said she has received surprising interest from Republican and independent voters who might not have considered her in previous elections.\n\n\"This is a very strange year,\" she said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Allan Smith\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate for governor, said Sunday that he was investigating the state Democratic Party for an attempted hack of the voter registration system \u2014 a claim met with a swift response from Democrats charging him with a shameless \"political stunt\" two days before Election Day.\n\nKemp, who is in a neck-and-neck race with Stacey Abrams, alleged that the state Democratic Party made a \"failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system\" and announced that his office was opening an investigation into the party. Kemp said his office alerted the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, but he offered no evidence to back up his allegation.\n\n\"While we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes,\" Candice Broce, press secretary for the secretary of state, said in a statement. \"We can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.\"\n\nBroce told NBC News that the office will release additional information \"as soon as we can.\"\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Kemp's office released a new statement saying the secretary of state opened the investigation \"after receiving information from our legal team about failed efforts to breach the online voter registration system and My Voter Page.\"\n\n\"We are working with our private sector vendors and investigators to review data logs,\" Kemp's office said. \"We have contacted our federal partners and formally requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate these possible cyber crimes.\"\n\nDemocrats blasted the announcement, which comes amid the backdrop of one of the nation's most fiercely contested races ahead of Election Day on Tuesday.\n\nRebecca DeHart, executive director of the state's Democratic Party, said in a statement that the investigation was \"yet another example of abuse of power by an unethical Secretary of State.\"\n\n\"To be very clear, Brian Kemp's scurrilous claims are 100 percent false, and this so-called investigation was unknown to the Democratic Party of Georgia until a campaign operative in Kemp's official office released a statement this morning,\" DeHart said. \"This political stunt from Kemp just days before the election is yet another example of why he cannot be trusted and should not be overseeing an election in which he is also a candidate for governor.\"\n\nDeHart later added that Georgians \"of all political stripes are very concerned about election security and the security of Georgians' personal information.\"\n\n\"The Democratic Party of Georgia shares that concern,\" she said, \"but we did not create, discover, or attempt to take advantage of the deeply vulnerable system used by the Secretary of State's office.\"\n\nDuring an interview Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Abrams called Kemp's announcement \"a desperate attempt on the part of my opponent to distract people\" from judicial rulings that had gone against decisions he made as secretary of state, the office that oversees voting in the state.\n\nIn one such battle, a federal judge ruled against Kemp on Friday and decided that the state must make it easier for some people flagged under Georgia's \"exact match\" law to vote.\n\n\"He is desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures, from his refusal to honor his commitments and from the fact that he's part of a nationwide system of voter suppression that will not work in this election because we're going to outwork him, we're going to out vote him ... and we're going to win,\" Abrams said.\n\nThe race's most prominent back-and-forth involves Kemp's role as the state's top election official. The controversy centers on Kemp's having purged tens of thousands of voters, most of whom are black, from voter rolls. Kemp has denied that he is trying to suppress the black vote, saying he is simply following the law.\n\nAbrams has accused Kemp of undermining confidence in democracy and creating \"an atmosphere of fear\" for voters through his actions as secretary of state \u2014 allegations that Kemp has called \"a farce.\"\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter, a Georgian, recently called for Kemp to resign.\n\nAlso Sunday, Kemp tweeted a photo of five people he said were dressed as members of the New Black Panther Party and were holding signs in support of Abrams. That group is described by the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center as \"a virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews and law enforcement officers.\"\n\nLast month, Kemp came under fire after he posed for a photo with an anti-Muslim extremist.\n\nAbigail Collazo, a spokeswoman for the Abrams campaign, said in a statement that Kemp \"is the only candidate in this race who has posed for pictures with supporters wearing racist, hate-filled T-shirts and refused to denounce them, while Abrams continues to condemn any racist, anti-Semitic, or otherwise discriminatory words and actions.\"\n\nPolling has shown the race to be tight. An October NBC News/Marist poll found that the race was essentially tied, with likely voters favoring Kemp by 49 percent to 47 percent, a spread within the poll's margin of error. Among registered voters, the two candidates are tied at 47 percent.\n\nIf she wins, Abrams would become the nation's first black female governor.", "Full Panel: Midterm enthusiasm turnout approaches 'presidential' levels copied!\n\nTom Brokaw, Savannah Guthrie, Kasie Hunt, Cornell Belcher and Hugh Hewitt discuss the record levels of turnout and enthusiasm, and ask what it might mean on election night.\n\nRead More", "Haslam: 'Kavanaugh hearings did change things' in Tennessee copied!\n\nGov.

If you are watching closely, however, you can probably get a good idea of the way things are going early in the evening by keeping your eye on three states: Indiana, Kentucky and Virginia.\n\nResults in key races in those states will likely offer strong clues about the fate of House and Senate control in 2019.\n\nIndiana Senate \u2014 6 p.m. ET poll close\n\nThe race here between Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly and Republican businessman Mike Braun is listed as a tossup by the Cook Political Report and it\u2019s worth watching for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, Donnelly is an incumbent Democrat trying to win reelection in a state Republican Donald Trump won by 19 points in 2016. So the result may offer a larger clue about similar races in other Democrat/Trump states, such as Missouri and Montana. Second, in a broader sense, the outcome here could have a big impact on who ultimately controls the Senate. Republicans already have a 51-49 edge in the upper chamber, if they win here, they\u2019ll be feeling good about growing that margin.\n\nRepublicans already have a 51-49 edge in the upper chamber, if they win here, they\u2019ll be feeling good about growing that margin.\n\nNot all polls close at 6 p.m. ET in Indiana \u2014 the northwestern and southwestern corners of the state close an hour later. On the early side, keep an eye on the vote in blue-collar Madison County, north and east of Indianapolis. Donnelly won it with 52 percent of the vote in 2012, but Trump won it with 59 percent in 2016.\n\nKentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District \u2014 6 p.m. ET close\n\nIn this district, which holds Lexington and much of the surrounding area, incumbent Republican Rep. Andy Barr is facing off against former Marine Corps pilot Amy McGrath. The race is currently rated a tossup by Cook.\n\nKentucky 6 will test a few important points Tuesday. The district sits in \u201cred\u201d Kentucky, but it\u2019s home to two entities that could make it tough turf for Barr: The University of Kentucky, which is home to many younger, left-leaning voters, and the state capital of Frankfurt, the kind of place that tends to hold a lot of establishment Republicans who are not enamored with Trump.\n\nThe 6th also is known for producing a lot of bourbon \u2014 Woodford Reserve, Wild Turkey are based in the district \u2014 a liquor that was hit hard by Trump tariffs earlier this year.\n\nIf Barr loses here, it may be a sign of struggles for the GOP in other university/state capital districts around the country \u2014 Ohio 12, Pennsylvania 10, Michigan 8, Iowa 3 and Virginia 7. And rural agricultural counties hit by tariffs.\n\nVirginia\u2019s 2nd, 5th, 7th and 10th Congressional Districts \u2014 7 p.m. ET close\n\nOf all the early close states, Virginia is likely to tell us the most about the direction of the evening, at least where the House of Representatives is concerned. It is home to four Republican incumbent races that sit along different parts of the \u201cpossible flip\u201d continuum.\n\nVirginia 10 is the seat most likely to flip Democratic. Located in the Washington, D.C. suburbs, it\u2019s currently held by Rep. Barbara Comstock, but rated \u201clean Democrat\u201d by Cook. If the race is close, or if Comstock wins, that would be a good sign for House Republicans.\n\nIf the GOP loses here, it may be time for a blue wave watch.\n\nVirginia 2 and 7 are both rated tossups by Cook. Both are above the national average for college degrees and home to smaller-city suburban populations \u2014 around Norfolk/Virginia Beach and Richmond respectively. If Democrats win in these districts, they might start measuring the drapes in the House Speaker\u2019s office.\n\nVirginia 5 is rated \u201clean Republican\u201d and most years it would be the kind of seat the GOP wins easily. It\u2019s rural and has voted for the Republican candidate in each of the past three presidential elections by comfortable margins. If the GOP loses here, it may be time for a blue wave watch.\n\nThese races won\u2019t tell us everything, of course. Every contest is unique and, as any good campaign operative will tell you, candidates matter. The one big lesson out of 2016 is that surprises happen and there will probably be a few, or more than a few, in the 470 House and Senate elections Tuesday night \u2014 and don\u2019t forget the gubernatorial and state house campaigns.\n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for an early read on the evening, these three states should at least give a sense of which party has the upper hand going into the late-night hours.", "Full Stacey Abrams: \u2018We have seen unprecedented turnout in this race\u2019 copied!\n\nDemocratic Candidate for Georgia Governor, Stacey Abrams, says that threats of voter suppression have motivated voters, during an interview with Meet the Press.\n\nRead More", "Get the Better newsletter.\n\nBy Amanda Loudin\n\nAsk a runner what his or her favorite season is and odds are it is fall.

It\u2019s no wonder some of the most popular marathons take place in October and November.\n\nAs much as runners love fall, however, it is inevitable that getting the clothing right on those first few cooler runs takes some trial and error. Was it the long-sleeved zip tee or the short-sleeve with arm warmer combo that works best when it\u2019s 50 degrees? Capris or shorts?\n\nExperienced runners like Colorado-based Amanda Brooks, author of \"Run to the Finish\", and New England-based Allie Burdick, freelance writer and author of \"VitaTrainForLife\", know the drill well.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Brandi Vincent\n\nAt a recent panel on modernizing Social Security numbers, Candace Worley, vice president and chief technical strategist for cybersecurity firm McAfee, laid out the core problem with the national identity system that has been in place since 1936.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have 80 percent of your numbers compromised and continue to consider it a secure form of identity,\u201d Worley said.\n\nSocial Security Numbers, or SSNs, remain an integral part of how Americans and U.S. residents are identified for everything from opening bank accounts and applying for loans to enrolling in Medicare and filing taxes. But a series of major data breaches in the past decade have exposed the Social Security numbers of almost 158 million Americans, opening a large majority of the country to the risk of identity theft.\n\nThose breaches have pushed privacy advocates and politicians to call for a new system.\n\n\u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, chairman of the House Social Security Subcommittee, said. \u201cWe must promptly evaluate options and begin putting in place those that will best protect Americans from identity theft.\u201d\n\nThe problem is well-recognized, but the solution is not. Experts and politicians have warned that the SSN system is badly in need of an update, but there is little consensus on just what should be done. Most solutions are either technologically untested, expensive to implement \u2014 or both.\n\nGet smart\n\nOne of the most common suggestions for updating SSNs is moving the U.S. to a \u201csmart card\u201d system, like the one suggested in a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, a nonprofit research organization that aims to provide solutions for current and emerging foreign policy and national security issues.\n\n\u201cThe simplest approach to modernization would be for the U.S. to transform the venerable Social Security Card into a \u2018smart card,\u2019\u201d which would be a plastic card with a readable chip, similar to modern credit cards, the report states. Under that system, Americans would use two numbers \u2014 an encrypted SSN and a \u201cproxy\u201d number that would link the smart card and could be changed if compromised.\n\nJames A. Lewis, senior vice president at CSIS and author of the report, said that smart cards offer the most attractive approach for the immediate future because they build on existing technology and involve a widely adopted embedded chip that people are already comfortable using in credit cards. They would also enable an incremental approach to modernization that could curtail inevitable hiccups along the way.\n\nOthers aren\u2019t optimistic about smart cards. Paul Grassi, an identity and cybersecurity expert who served as senior standards and technology advisor at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a non-regulatory agency that develops technical standards, said smart cards aren\u2019t a good solution.\n\n\u201cGiving me a smart card does nothing unless the entire global infrastructure of global institutions is changed to be able to interact with a smartcard,\u201d Grassi said. \u201cIt\u2019ll never happen. The cost would be too astronomical.\u201d\n\nJoe Stuntz, principal of cybersecurity at One World Identity, a digital strategy consultancy focused on trust and the data economy, also said the smart card plan was too expensive.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see a budget environment where this gets prioritization over some of the other things that need to be funded in terms of cybersecurity or identity,\u201d Stuntz said.\n\nSSN reform is also running short on champions in the U.S. government. Johnson is retiring at the end of his term, and Rob Joyce, the White House cybersecurity coordinator who called for ideas for SSN replacements, left the administration in May \u2014 and his position was eliminated.\n\nTo the future and beyond\n\nThe identity and verification needs filled by SSNs are also problems that a variety of nascent technologies including biometrics and blockchain theoretically solve, leading some to hope that the best solution for national identity is yet to come.\n\nBut Stuntz, who previously ran smartcard programs for the federal government, said a cheaper, more viable solution could be found in something most Americans use daily: smartphones, which already have authentication and verification apps for private services.\n\n\u201cWhen smartphones have secure environments that could hold this type of information and be more accessible, I don\u2019t think the cost of a smart card is justified in that report,\u201d Stuntz said.\n\nAs for biometrics and blockchain, Grassi said that both need to answer major questions before they could be used to upgrade or replace the SSN system, including making sure they\u2019re secure and easy to use.\n\nAnd the U.S. national identity system, Lewis said, is not a place to test out new technology.\n\n\u201cThis will eventually change,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut making the SSN the testbed for a deployment involving hundreds of millions of individuals would create the risk of turmoil in the U.S. economy.\u201d", "Three races to watch on election night copied!\n\nResults in key races in these states will likely offer strong clues about the fate of House and Senate control in 2019.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Gen. Ben Hodges said at the Warsaw Security Forum in Poland.\n\nHis comments echoed those of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who said in 2016: \"We're going to war in the South China Sea in five to 10 years, there's no doubt about that.\"\n\nBannon pointed to a network of military bases Beijing has built on artificially enlarged coral reefs in the hotly contested body of water. The militarized outposts feature runways, sea ports and multi-story buildings, and there have even been reports of missile deployments.\n\nChinese dredging vessels in the waters around Fiery Cross Reef in the South China Sea in 2015.

But most believe the world is a considerable ways away from a war between its two largest economies.\n\n\"There's clearly been a sharpening of the rhetoric between the two countries, and we're currently seeing a real push in a worrying direction,\" says Raffaello Pantucci, director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \"There's a genuine concern it might end up somewhere horrible.\"\n\nXi didn't mention any enemy by name when he made the comments, but they came up during a tour at the Southern Theater Command, in Guangdong province, which is responsible for monitoring Taiwan and the South China Sea.\n\nChina claims a huge chunk of this sea as its own, giving it control over a crucial, oil-rich choke-point through which $5.3 trillion of trade passes every year.\n\nIt was there in September that a Chinese warship came within 45 feet of colliding with the USS Decatur. The near-collision was during one of the fairly regular voyages by U.S. ships and planes into the waters, an attempt by Washington to show Beijing that it can't restrict freedom of passage.\n\nThe USS Decatur in the South China Sea in 2016.

John Richardson, the chief of U.S. Naval Operations, said at an event in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Tuesday.\n\nHodges said September's maritime near-collision was only one example of \"an increasingly tense relationship.\"\n\nOther points of friction, Hodges said, are China's vast infrastructure projects in Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as its \"constant stealing of technology.\"\n\nThen there's Taiwan. China considers the island a runaway province; the United States has sold it $25 billion of arms since 2007. When the Trump administration approved the sale of $330 million of F-16 parts in September, Beijing said it lodged \"stern representations\" against the move.\n\nWhile it's not in U.S. or Chinese interests to start a war, one way that might happen is through a misunderstanding or bad communication, especially if animosity over the trade war means the sides stop speaking with each other.\n\n\"The Chinese might think, 'We're going to build a base here,' and the Americans decide, 'That one is too far,'\" Pantucci said. \"Or two boats bump into each other, or something happens with Taiwan.\"\n\nWhile such scenarios are worrying, Pantucci said they're not quite the precursor to the all-out combat imagined by more hawkish types.\n\n\"Are we going to see a conflict soon, like Steve Bannon's doomsday proclamation? I tend to be a little less apocalyptic than that. I tend to think that cooler heads will eventually prevail,\" Pantucci added.\n\nOne thing to remember, according to experts, is that China is not Russia.\n\nRussia has a relatively small economy and is less powerful than it was 30 years ago. It punches above its weight by sowing chaos and using hard power in places like Syria, Ukraine and Georgia, not to mention the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\n\"That is not China's game; China's game is to become the world's biggest power,\" Pantucci said. \"It doesn't want a nuclear war, because nuclear war is not conducive to growth.\"\n\nThose seeking reassurance can also look to the trade war that is starting to bite on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nShare markets soared Friday after a phone call between Trump and Xi resulted in a positive tweet from the American president.\n\nJust had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China.

Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for International and Strategic Studies\n\nThe United States and China \"have a couple things going for them that no other two great powers ever have,\" he said.\n\n\"They are economically intertwined in a way that raises the costs of conflict for both,\" he added, \"and they are operating in an international web of institutions and norms that help blunt their worst impulses and offer avenues for peaceful contestation.\"\n\nMost Americans don't seem too bothered. In a poll in October by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, fewer than 4 in 10 people said the development of China was a critical threat to U.S. interests.\n\nPoling recognized that the South China Sea and Taiwan were \"potential triggers\" for a conflict, but for now, will he be losing sleep over it?\n\n\"Not tonight, no,\" he said.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 4, 2018, 5:30 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated when the Trump administration approved the sale of $330 million of F-16 parts to Taiwan.

They've developed a specialized fluid that absorbs a bit of sunlight's energy, holds it for months or even years and then releases it when needed. If this so-called solar thermal fuel can be perfected, it might drive another nail in the coffin of fossil fuels \u2014 and help solve our global-warming crisis.\n\nUnlike oil, coal and natural gas, solar thermal fuels are reusable and environmentally friendly. They release energy without spewing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\n\"A solar thermal fuel is like a rechargeable battery, but instead of electricity, you put sunlight in and get heat out, triggered on demand,\" says Jeffrey Grossman, who leads a lab at MIT that works on such materials.\n\nA molecular Jekyll and Hyde\n\nOn the roof of the physics building at Chalmers University of Technology in the Swedish city of Gothenburg, Kasper Moth-Poulsen has built a prototype system to test the new solar thermal fuels his research group has created.\n\nAs a pump cycles the fluid through transparent tubes, ultraviolet light from the sun excites its molecules into an energized state, a bit like Dr. Jekyll transforming into Mr. Hyde. The light rearranges bonds among the carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen atoms in the fuel, converting a compound known as norbornadiene into another called quadricyclane \u2014 the energetic Mr. Hyde version. Because the energy is trapped in strong chemical bonds, the quadricyclane retains the captured solar power even when it cools down.\n\nThe energy system works in a circular manner. First, the liquid captures energy from sunlight, in a solar thermal collector on the roof of a building. Then it is stored at room temperature. When the energy is needed, it can be drawn through the catalyst so that the liquid heats up. Yen Strandqvist\n\nTo extract that stored energy, Moth-Poulsen passes the activated fuel over a cobalt-based catalyst. The Hyde-like quadricyclane molecules then shapeshift back into their Jekyll form, norbornadiene. The transformation releases copious amounts of heat \u2014 enough to raise the fuel's temperature by 63 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nIf the fuel starts at room temperature (about 21 degrees C, or 70 degrees F), it quickly warms to around 84 degrees C (183 degrees F) \u2014 easily hot enough to heat a house or office.\n\n\"You could use that thermal energy for your water heater, your dishwasher or your clothes dryer,\" Grossman says. \"There could be lots of industrial applications as well.\" Low-temperature heat used for cooking, sterilization, bleaching, distillation and other commercial operations accounts for 7 percent of all energy consumption in the European Union, Moth-Poulsen says.\n\nA solar thermal fuel could be stored in uninsulated tanks inside houses or factories \u2014 or perhaps piped or trucked between solar farms and cities. Very little of the fuel or the catalyst is damaged by the reactions, so the system can operate in a closed loop, picking up solar energy and dropping off heat again and again. \"We've run it though 125 cycles without any significant degradation,\" Moth-Poulsen says.\n\nHeat without fire\n\nMoth-Poulsen has calculated that the best variant of his fuel can store up to 250 watt-hours of energy per kilogram. Pound for pound, that's roughly twice the energy capacity of the Tesla Powerwall batteries that some homeowners and utilities now use to store electricity generated by solar panels.\n\n\"I'm very excited by what Kasper is doing,\" Grossman says of the research. After a burst of work on norbornadiene fuels in the 1970s, he says, chemists were stymied. The fuels kept breaking down after a few cycles. They didn't hold their energy very long, and they had to be mixed with toxic solvents that diluted the energy-grabbing fuel. Moth-Poulsen \"has gone back to that molecule and is using state-of-the-art tools to fix it,\" Grossman says.\n\nThe new results, published in a series of scientific papers over the past year, have caught the attention of investors. Moth-Poulsen says numerous companies have contacted him to discuss the potential for commercialization.\n\nFrom prototype to product\n\nFor all the promise of solar thermal fuels, years of development lie ahead. \"We've made a lot of progress,\" Moth-Poulsen says, \"but there is still a lot to figure out.\"\n\nA crucial next step will be to develop a single fuel that combines the best characteristics of the many fuel variants the Chalmers team has developed \u2014 including long shelf life, high energy density and good recyclability.\n\nWei Feng, who leads a research group working on solar thermal fuels at China's Tianjin University, points to solvent-free operation as another \"big challenge for future commercialization.\"\n\nMoth-Poulsen's prototype fuels are made via common industrial processes and from widely available industrial agents, including derivatives of acetylene. But it's unclear how much a commercial version of the fuel would cost.\n\nOne important factor in the cost will be the fuel's efficiency, which currently is quite low. The prototype fuels respond only to the shortest wavelengths of sunlight, including ultraviolet and blue, which account for just 5 percent of the solar energy available. Moth-Poulsen says he's working to extend the fuel's sensitivity to include more of the spectrum.\n\nHe's also aiming to break his own record of a 63-degree C temperature increase. When that heat is added to water that has been preheated to 40 degrees C or more by conventional solar collectors, he says, \"That's just enough to boil water into steam.\" The steam could then drive turbines to make electricity. But with more tweaks to the chemical structure, he says, \"I think we could push [the temperature increase] to 80 degrees C or higher.\" For electricity generation, hotter is better.\n\n\"When I started, there was really only one research group working on these kinds of systems,\" the 40-year-old Moth-Poulsen recalls. But progress has drawn others to the challenge. \"Now there are teams in the U.S., in China, in Germany \u2014 about 15 around the world,\" he says.\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT CLEAN ENERGY?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Rev. William J. Barber, II and Eddie S. Glaude, Jr.\n\nPresident Donald Trump didn\u2019t create our crisis of confidence in one another; he capitalized on it. And now he is appealing to what he assumes are Americans' crass selfishness and greed as he touts the state of the economy and the gains in the stock market at small-scale reenactments of his 2016 MAGA rallies. He is aiming to stoke fears and anxieties among his base with his talk of crime and the so-called ominous \u201ccaravan\u201d of criminals and terrorists threatening our border \u2014 an old conservative trope, that the supposed barbarians are at the gates.\n\nOver the last two years, we have been inundated with Trump\u2019s antics and Republican policies, and the 24-hour news cycle and social media keep him in front of our faces daily. In the political theater he has created, he now plays the race card with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d message, hoping that it can help Republicans keep control of Congress\n\nBut voters across the country must hold a firm grip on reality because, for the first time since Donald Trump took control of the executive branch and the Republican Party, Americans across the country have an opportunity to make their voices heard at the ballot box. And they need to remember, now and after this election, that it wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s message that worked in 2016. It was voter suppression, gerrymandering and the Electoral College.\n\nThe president who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million and has never broken a 45 percent approval rating for his entire presidency (and is, more often than not, under 40 percent) does not have the structural advantage in the midterms that he did in 2016. District-by-district, state-by-state, he and his fellow Republicans have to try to convince everyday Americans that a political agenda which serves the wealthiest Americans while hurting poor and working people (as well as the environment) is somehow good for them.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard case to make, but the GOP has been preparing a playbook for 50 years that makes Trump\u2019s con game possible.\n\nFirst off is engaging their base, a coalition that depends on racial fears and religious sentiment. \u201cJobs Not Mobs\u201d is the slogan Republicans have chosen this year, casting the unprecedented numbers of nonviolent protests since Trump\u2019s inauguration as a threat to our common life. The Southern Strategy wing of the GOP adopted this tactic directly from the segregationists of the 1950s and 60s, who regularly derided the protests of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and others as the threat of \u201cmob rule.\u201d\n\nThe proposed alternative to this imagined threat, then, is the leadership of Republican politicians who use the religious language of \u201cvalues.\u201d Like the Southern preachers who defended slavery and preached against the \u201cimmorality\u201d of Reconstruction, or those addressed by Dr. King in the \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail,\u201d various evangelicals have joined Trump and Republicans on the campaign trail, praying their god\u2019s blessing over candidates who promise to prop up the president\u2019s agenda.\n\nRepublican strategists, however, know that effectiveness of their openly racist tactics are dwindling as their older and whiter crowd is shrinking in numbers. In response to that clear fact, they have taken another page from the segregationist\u2019s playbook: Voter suppression.\n\nMuch more sophisticated than the poll taxes and literacy tests of the Jim Crow era, today\u2019s voter suppression tactics are built on complex data sets that tell Republicans in power exactly whose votes they need to suppress to hold onto power. Since the 2010 census, dozens of congressional districts have been gerrymandered to \u201cstack and pack\u201d voters who oppose Republicans in a small number of districts so that the majority of districts aren\u2019t competitive.\n\nIn addition, Republicans have also touted the myth of voter fraud to implement voter ID laws, cross-check systems and voter roll purges designed to suppress the votes of young people, poor people, and African Americans. Journalist Ari Berman has documented how, before Trump won Wisconsin by 30,000 votes in 2016, Republicans had suppressed as many as 250,000 votes through these tactics. The same tactics are being deployed to sway tight races in Georgia, North Carolina, Kansas and elsewhere this year.\n\nGiven these attacks on our democracy, the \u201cblue wave\u201d that many pundits and pollsters have forecast is far from certain. It is entirely possible that a majority of Americans could vote for Democrats in this election, and both houses of Congress would nonetheless remain in control of the party that Trump now owns.\n\nIf this happens, it will make it even more difficult to reconstruct the basic infrastructure of American democracy.\n\nThe time to fight for the heart of our democracy is now. We must all vote like we never have before, turning out even in the places where we\u2019ve not expected to win for generations. We now know our real power; we saw it in Alabama when African Americans \u2014 particularly African American women \u2014 turned out in record numbers. We saw young voters and African American voters in the Florida primary turn the tide and propel Andrew Gillum to an unexpected win.\n\nWe know what grassroots organizing can do. We see it in the Poor People\u2019s campaign, in the Women\u2019s March and in those local efforts across the country to shift the assumptions about who actually matters in this democracy.\n\nWe must continue to build coalitions between young people, African Americans, Latinos and poor and working-white people who have not benefited from the 20 percent stock market growth. And we must commit to work together for years to come.\n\nNeither the Democratic National Committee, people inside the Washington beltway nor political pundits can create this change. It must come from everyday people who finally decide they have had enough of being poorly represented \u2014 ordinary folk who will muster the spiritual wherewithal to fight for our democracy before it gives way.\n\nNow is the time to come together and commit to becoming the multi-ethnic democracy we\u2019ve never yet been.

I sent United States military to our border. And I looked at those young, great people and I looked at those generals giving the orders, and I looked at the way they worked and I watched that barbed wire being put down. Barbed wire,\" Trump told a crowd in Pensacola, where he was revving up voters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nThe remarks referenced the arrival of the first wave of the up to 15,000 troops Trump said he has dispatched to help secure the southern border. The troops began putting up chain-link fencing topped with barbed wire earlier in the day Saturday.\n\nTrump, who was visiting the Sunshine State to campaign for GOP gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis and GOP Senate candidate Rick Scott, hammered away at Democrats on illegal immigration, a favorite topic and one he\u2019s doubled down on in the days before Tuesday\u2019s elections.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Diamond Naga Siu\n\nVoters in Washington state on Tuesday could approve a measure that would lower one of the nation's toughest barriers to prosecuting police for use of deadly force.\n\nSpearheaded by De-Escalate Washington, a coalition of activist groups co-chaired by Andre Taylor, whose brother was fatally shot by Seattle police in 2016, ballot initiative 940 would remove the state's unique malice requirement, which says prosecutors must prove an officer acted with \"evil intent\" when bringing criminal charges for killing in the line of duty.\n\nThe initiative would also create a two-part good-faith test to determine when use of deadly force is justifiable and expand de-escalation, first aid and mental health crisis training requirements for officers.\n\nOpponents, including some Republican state lawmakers and the Coalition for a Safer Washington, which is made up of multiple law enforcement organizations, say the proposal would put officers at risk and waste taxpayer dollars. The initiative's backers, like some progressive state lawmakers and the ACLU of Washington, say the reforms would make communities safer and save lives.\n\n\"We think we're going to be the first state that sets the precedent of police accountability around the nation,\" Taylor told NBC News. \"It's just like the first time that law enforcement has had to listen.\"\n\nAccording to an Amnesty International analysis, Washington has the highest bar for prosecuting law enforcement officers. A statewide investigation conducted by The Seattle Times in 2015 found that fatal killings had surged over the past decade, while only one officer was charged. The ACLU of Washington, which partnered with De-Escalate to help advance the initiative, called the state's current use of force standard \"out of date.\"\n\nAlexis Dunlap, wearing a #Justice4Chance shirt, shares her story of losing her 17-year-old son during a press conference hosted by De-Escalate Washington and Not This Time, another activist organization. Her son was shot by police outside their apartment last January. Andre Taylor\n\nDe-Escalate Washington organizers raised at least $1 million in support and collected more than 350,000 voter signatures to get the initiative on the ballot in December 2017. A poll commissioned by the group and conducted by outside research firm EMC Research in February 2018 found that a majority of likely Washington voters supported it.\n\nIn March, however, the state legislature narrowly passed a bill amending the initiative prior to allowing Washingtonians to vote on it. That bill included input from De-Escalate and was supported by law enforcement groups like the Fraternal Order of Police, an influential union, and the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, according to The News Tribune. The Tacoma newspaper reported that under the bill, the malice clause would still be removed, but good faith was defined as asking whether a \"reasonable\" officer would have taken the same actions.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Jay Inslee signed the law, praising activists, police, and politicians in a statement at the time for their efforts at compromise. But after a challenge, the state's Supreme Court ruled that the original version of I-940 had to appear on November's ballot and that the legislature had erred in tweaking a citizen initiative before voters had a chance to approve or reject it, according to The Seattle New Times.\n\nTeresa Taylor, executive director of the Washington Council of Police and Sheriffs, said the organization is against I-940 because she thinks it will not effect the change De-Escalate wants to bring about.\n\n\u201cWe represent about 4,500 rank and file police officers throughout the state of Washington, and we cannot sit quietly by and not let voters know that the language in the current initiative is language that we cannot suggest they vote for,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\nCoalition for a Safer Washington said in October that while I-940 is \"camouflaged as a training initiative, its real goal is to make it easier to prosecute a police officer who takes a life while facing threats protecting his or her community.\"\n\nBut not all members of state law enforcement are against the ballot measure as it stands. In a Video Voters' guide, King County Sheriff Mitzi Johanknecht said she supported a \"yes\" vote on I-940.\n\n\"I know and love the law enforcement profession,\" she said in the video. \"I also know how important trust is for building safe communities. And I believe 'yes' on 940 will increase trust and be a win-win for communities and police.\"\n\nOn Friday, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan offered her city's support to the ballot measure, as well, saying that she sees it as a \"really important mechanism to make sure that the gains we have in Seattle can be shared statewide as quickly as possible.\"\n\nRepublican state Sen. Doug Ericksen told The News Tribune in March that changes to the legal standard, such as removing the malice clause, could impede the work of police officers in dangerous situations.\n\n\"We need to stand up against this and be very clear that we support people who are in law enforcement in our state,\" Ericksen said.\n\nTaylor defended his group's initiative, saying, \"We're not against law enforcement.\" He also said that regardless of the outcome in November, De-Escalate and law enforcement groups have committed to working together on compromise legislation. Some lawmakers, including Democratic state Sen. Rebecca Salda\u00f1a, have said they're committed to seeing compromise legislation become law.\n\n\u201cThere are law enforcement officers that support what we\u2019re doing, and they wouldn\u2019t support it if they think we\u2019re against them,\" Taylor said. \"It's just that we have a law that is impossible to hold an officer accountable, and that's called de facto immunity.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Abrams would be the first black female governor in U.S. history. Kemp, who oversees elections as Georgia's secretary of state, vehemently denies charges that he's used his office to make it harder for minorities to vote.\n\nAbrams and Kemp are both condemning an automated telephone call filled with racist and anti-Semitic statements. The call, sent to an unknown number of Georgians, impersonates Oprah Winfrey, the billionaire media titan who came to Georgia on Thursday to support Abrams.\n\nThe robocall says it was paid for by The Road to Power, a group organized by Scott Rhodes of Idaho. He has been linked to several other racist robocalls, including a recent effort in Florida, where Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum would become the first black governor in his state's history.\n\nKemp issued a statement calling the tactic \"vile\" and \"contrary to the highest ideals of our state and country,\" and condemning \"any person or organization that peddles this type of unbridled hate and unapologetic bigotry.\"\n\nThe Abrams camp likewise blasted the move but took a shot at Kemp and his highest profile supporter, President Donald Trump, who is coming to Georgia to campaign Sunday. A top Abrams aide said both Kemp and Trump have contributed to a poisonous atmosphere, and that Kemp has been silent on previous racially loaded attacks on Abrams.\n\n\"These automated calls are being sent into homes just days before President Trump arrives, reminding voters exactly who is promoting a political climate that celebrates this kind of vile, poisonous thinking,\" said Abrams' spokeswoman Abigail Collazo.\n\nAbrams sidestepped the issue Saturday in brief public remarks as she greeted voters at an Atlanta shopping complex along with her local congressman, civil rights icon John Lewis.\n\n\"Georgia has long been on a path of change and evolution,\" Abrams said. But she also said the election is about issues like expanding Medicaid insurance and focusing state spending on public education, job training and small business startups.\n\n\"I'm the only candidate with a plan to get that done and to do that without vitriol, without vilifying people,\" she added.\n\nLewis, the 78-year-old congressman who as a young man was severely beaten by police as he fought for voting rights in the Jim Crow South, put Georgia's choice in the broadest context: \"This young lady is playing a major role in helping liberate all of us, liberate the state of Georgia, liberate the South, liberate America.\"\n\nKemp did not address the robocalls at his only scheduled campaign stop Saturday at a Cuban restaurant in a diverse north-Atlanta suburb.\n\nKemp told the packed crowd of supporters that the race for governor was a simple choice: one between continued economic prosperity under Republican leadership, or a turn to \"socialism\" under Democrats.\n\nKemp said the election was about \"this generation and generations to come and the kind of state that we leave them.\" He then blasted Abrams' policy pitches on health care and education.\n\nThe Kemp event was also hit by a number of protesters. Two men protesting Kemp's immigration policy while Kemp was onstage were forcibly removed from the restaurant.\n\nAs a TV crew from MSNBC tried to film the hecklers being removed, a Kemp supporter physically blocked their path and the view of their lens.\n\nAnd someone out front was wearing a giant chicken suit holding a sign that reads \"too chicken to debate,\" alluding to Kemp withdrawing from a debate scheduled Sunday in favor of appearing in Macon with President Donald Trump.\n\nMuch of the final stretch of the race was consumed by a bitter battle over race and access to the polls.\n\nTensions grew after an Associated Press report in early October that more than 53,000 voter applications \u2014 nearly 70 percent of them from black applicants \u2014 were on hold with Kemp's office ahead of the election.\n\nMany of the applications were flagged for failing to pass the state's \"exact match\" verification process, which requires that identification information on voter registration applications precisely match information already on file.\n\nKemp's office says that eligible voters on the \"pending\" list can still vote if they bring a proper ID that substantially matches their registration information. He called the controversy \"manufactured.\"\n\nBut critics say county officials aren't always trained to make the proper determination and the system can be particularly hard to navigate for recently naturalized citizens.\n\nIn response to a lawsuit brought by civil rights groups, a judge on Friday ruled the state unfairly burdens about 3,100 possible voters whose registration was flagged for citizenship issues.\n\nShe ruled that Georgia must immediately start allowing poll managers \u2014 not just deputy registrars \u2014 to clear flagged voters who show proof of citizenship.\n\nIn a statement, Kemp said the lawsuit forced the state \"to waste time and taxpayer dollars for the judge to tell us to do something that we already do.\"", "Democratic Rep.

He had been scheduled to perform in New Jersey Saturday night.\n\n\"The Great Roy Hargrove: He is literally the one man horn section I hear in my head when I think about music,\" wrote Questlove in an Instagram post. \"I know I've spoken (of) every aspect of Soulquarian era recording techniques but even I can't properly document how crucial and spot on Roy was with his craft, man. We NEVER gave him instructions: just played the song and watched him go.\"\n\nQuestlove wrote about how you can hear him and other band members screaming and laughing during a Hargrove solo on the Common track \"Cold Blooded\" because \"that's us MIND BLOWN... We were just reacting in real time to greatness... And a beautiful cat, man. Love to the immortal timeless genius that will forever be Roy Hargrove, y'all.\"\n\nSaid another key young trumpeter, Keyon Harrold, \"My heart again is broken by news of the trumpeter jazz king Roy Hargrove passing on... I was captivated by Roy's soul,\" Harrold wrote on Instagram. \"The spirit that radiated from the bell of his horn was always a force of youth enthralled with the wisdom of old. A jazz future to a jazz legend in the eyes of many. One of the people I watched as a benchmark of what I could be as trumpet player musically. The epitome of a soloist. Amazing arranger and composer. A jazz historian... Roy, thank you. You were always the inspiration. You are already missed though you live forever!!!\"\n\nHargrove was nominated for six Grammy Awards and won two \u2014 the first in 1998 for \"Habana,\" an album of Afro-Cuban music he recorded with his band Crisol, and the second in 2002 for \"Directions in Music: Live at Massey Hall,\" a tribute to Miles Davis and John Coltrane on which he collaborated with Herbie Hancock and Michael Brecker.\n\nA Texas native, Hargrove was discovered by Wynton Marsalis when that jazz great was visiting his performing arts high school in Dallas. Hargrove always cited as his primary inspiration David \"Fathead\" Newman, appreciating his improvisational prowess and saying he felt Newman was \"was so soulful and singing through his horn.\"\n\nHis first solo album, \"Diamond in the Rough,\" appeared in 1990 on Novus, for whom he made eight albums in four years. His career really took off with the 10 albums he recorded for Verve starting in 1994, including several with the RH Factor, a funkier band he formed to meld different styles into jazz.\n\nAs a guest musician, Hargrove played on recordings by John Mayer (\"Continuum\"), Sonny Rollins, Oscar Peterson, Jimmy Smith, Shirley Horn, Marcus Miller, Angelique Kidjo, Ray Brown and dozens of others. Most recently, he was featured on the sophomore album by Blue Note singer/pianist Kandace Springs, released in September.\n\nAlthough his output as a recording artist in his own right had come to a halt in the 2010s, Hargrove continued to be a prolific live performer through the end of his life.\n\nReviewing a two-week residency in Chicago in January, Downbeat magazine wrote, \"Hargrove fosters something of a Miles Davis vibe as relates to fashion, attitude and stagecraft. He avoids announcing tunes, but is less aloof and austere than Davis, sporadically singing and dancing, which Davis never would have countenanced... His dynamic spontaneity tied to a tight focus on the music is why Hargrove is revered; his horns don't shine like the custom models of Christian Scott and Tunde Adjuah. They are tarnished, well worn.\"\n\nHaving spoken with Hargrove's manager, Larry Clothier, NPR reported that Hargrove \"had been admitted to the hospital for reasons related to kidney function; he was on dialysis for many years.\"\n\nHargrove advocated for a bigger audience for jazz, even when he was drawing what most in the medium would consider sizable crowds. Downbeat reported that the trumpeter refused to take accolades for filling the house during his two-week residency in January, saying: \"You talk as though that's a big deal. Back in the day, they used to play for much longer periods of time, which really helped to solidify the way the band sounded. It should be a month -- it should be more. It's not enough. Everywhere it's not enough. But we can't get people to really support jazz like that.

They are conducting drills and putting up chain-link fencing topped with barbed wire.\n\nAbout 160 active-duty soldiers \u2014 mostly engineers and military police from various units \u2014 are now in the McAllen area, said U.S. Army Sgt. Maj. Faith Laughter.\n\nIn total, including members of the National Guard who have been at the border since April, Trump's military deployment to the border could cost more than $200 million, according to The Washington Post.\n\nHidalgo resident Josemaria Vasquez said she strongly opposes Trump's decision.\n\n\"There's better use of that money,\u201d Vasquez said. \u201cThis is not an invasion.\"\n\nMcAllen resident Marianna Trevino Wright said she\u2019s a Republican who voted for Trump, which she regrets.\n\n\"An enormous fraud is being perpetrated on the American people,\" she said, adding she believes Trump ordered troops to the border to energize Republican voters in the midterm elections Tuesday.\n\nBut some border patrol agents are grateful for help from the troops Trump has sent.\n\nChris Cabrera, border patrol agent and spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, said agents like him have needed help \"for some time.\" Still, he said that he feels lawmakers need to enact change to actually fix the issue of migrants crossing the border.\n\n\"You can put them shoulder to shoulder from Brownsville to San Diego,\" Cabrera said of the troops at the border. \"All they got to do is put one foot on land and say I need asylum and we're still in the same position.\"\n\nCabrera said that although the troops cannot actually apprehend undocumented immigrants, they will act as extra eyes and ears for Border Patrol.\n\nMigrants, part of a caravan traveling from Central America en route to the United States walk by the road that links Ciudad Hidalgo with Tapachula, Mexico on Nov. 2, 2018.

He added that Border Patrol will still continue to operate as it has with or without extra support.\n\n\"As far as border patrol agents, I think we're going to continue doing what we do,\" Cabrera said. \"Obviously if we can get some more manpower, that'll help out but we are going to continue to operate like we do because we're used to doing more with less.\"\n\nEstimates of the sizes of the three caravans making their way to the border vary widely. But according to Mexican and Salvadorean officials, about 8,000 people are making their way toward the United States.\n\nMany in the caravans are women and children who say they are fleeing rampant gang violence in Central America. But the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a statement Thursday that said about half are single men and at least 270 have criminal histories. It is not clear how they made that determination or how they arrived at that number.\n\nOn Friday, the governor of the Mexican state of Veracruz, Miguel Angel Yunes, said that his government would provide 100 buses to transport the migrants to Mexico City or \u201cany other place they want\u201d as early as Saturday.\n\nHowever, hours later, he suddenly pulled the offer, saying the migrants should not head to Mexico City because of ongoing water maintenance there, which was expected to leave millions without water for several days.

People who visit the databases online can see videos and images from the ads, as well as spending data and, in theory, who is behind each of the ads.\n\nThe companies acted under threats of federal regulation after reports that Russian operatives bought politically divisive social media ads under fake names in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut huge loopholes in the databases remain, lawmakers and researchers say.\n\nJaap Arriens / NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe flaws suggest that the companies\u2019 efforts, while producing vast amounts of data, may not be enough to stave off action by Congress, state lawmakers or election regulators.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a much better place now in terms of transparency than we were two years ago, but there is a long way to go,\u201d said Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington nonprofit that advocates for stricter campaign finance laws.\n\nOn Friday, two senators said they had sent a letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, urging him to address loopholes in the social network\u2019s archive of political ads.\n\n\u201cFree and fair elections require both transparency and accountability which give the public a right to know the true sources of funding for political advertisements in order to make informed political choices and hold elected officials accountable,\u201d Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Mark Warner, D-Va., wrote in the letter.\n\nThe senators sent a separate letter to Larry Page, CEO of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, in April urging him to be more transparent about political ads.\n\nKlobuchar and Warner are sponsors of legislation known as the Honest Ads Act that would require sellers of online ads to meet some of the same political ad requirements as radio and television companies. Facebook and Twitter have backed the bill.\n\nSome of the problems with political ads may be beyond the control of tech companies. Political organizations raise and spend millions of dollars each election in so-called \u201cdark money\u201d \u2014 or money whose origin isn\u2019t publicly known, sometimes because it runs through a limited liability company. Those groups buy ads online and offline.\n\n\u201cFacebook and Google are not going to be able to disclose the sources of money behind a dark-money organization,\u201d Fischer said. \u201cThat is the responsibility of Congress and the FEC,\u201d or Federal Election Commission, he said.\n\nAmong the transparency tools that the tech companies have rolled out this year, news organizations have discovered vulnerabilities.\n\nVice News reported last month that it was able to deceive Facebook\u2019s system into approving ads with the label that they were \u201cpaid for\u201d by sitting U.S. senators, though the ads had not been. It earlier won approval to run ads \u201cpaid for\u201d by Vice President Mike Pence and by the Islamic State, though they were not involved.\n\nProPublica reported on Thursday that the oil industry has been able to run Facebook ads under the name \u201cpaid for by Energy4US,\u201d a name that the news organization said appeared to be a front for the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, an industry trade group.\n\n\u201cThere are some major loopholes,\u201d said Daniel Kreiss, who researches political ads as a professor of media and journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cIf people can buy ads and have them approved coming from sources that are misleading or false or invented, that\u2019s a major problem.\u201d\n\nFacebook says it supports making political ads more transparent and that it is working to eliminate attempts at deception, such as inaccurate \u201cpaid for by\u201d labels.\n\nIn order to run ads with political content on Facebook, advertisers are required by the company to verify their identity and location, a demand that led to concern Facebook was being too strict with some ad buyers, such as Spanish-language advertisers.\n\nRob Leathern, Facebook\u2019s director of product management, said in a statement on Friday: \u201cThis publicly-available ad archive is valuable for news organizations, regulators, watchdog groups, and the public, and it\u2019s a way we\u2019re also held accountable \u2014 even if it means our mistakes are on display. We\u2019re exploring additional checks to help prevent abuse and will respond to requests from law enforcement and election officials now and in the future if new requirements arise.\u201d\n\nGoogle acknowledged when it launched its ad library in August that it had some shortcomings, such as the lack of information about issue ads, state and local election ads and ads in other countries. \u201cWe know there is more work to be done,\u201d the company said at the timethen. Google on Friday reiterated that statement but declined to say what progress it had made since August.\n\nThe company, owner of the world\u2019s No. 1 search engine, this year decided not to sell certain political ads at all rather than risk not complying with state regulations about advertising disclosures. It is not selling ads related to ballot measures or to state or local candidates in Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey or Washington state.\n\nTwitter, which is smaller than Google or Facebook both in ad sales and engineering resources, also has pledged to improve its political ad database. Like Google, Twitter on Friday declined to give a timeline for further changes.\n\nTravis Ridout, a Washington State University government professor, said the tech companies\u2019 databases are better than what existed before, \u201cwhich was nothing,\u201d he said. But their efforts aren\u2019t everything that advocates for transparency hoped for.\n\n\u201cThey sort of have a bargain right now: that government will not intervene if the companies take some responsibility,\u201d Ridout said.

Joe Donnelly. The candidates are running neck-and-neck, according to a new NBC News/Marist poll of the state. Donnelly gets support from 48 percent of likely voters, while Braun gets 46 percent; 7 percent are undecided or prefer someone else.\n\nIn his pitch to voters, Giuliani said Democrats want to impeach Trump and Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh if they get majorities in the House and Senate.\n\n\"So if you make a mistake...and you don\u2019t vote for (Braun), that's what you're voting for,\" he said.\n\nNBC chance encounter with Sessions\n\nAs Trump prepared to speak to supporters in Bozeman, Montana, NBC News spotted Attorney General Jeff Sessions making a personal visit to the White House.\n\nNBC News White House correspondent Geoff Bennett encountered Sessions with his family in the White House briefing room.

To travel between the mainland of Puerto Rico and Vieques, people have to take a ferry or a flight.\n\nBut being \u201can island off an island,\u201d as some describe it, has disproportionately slowed down recovery efforts for the roughly 9,000 Puerto Ricans living in Vieques.\n\nWhile it took the power authority 11 months to restore full power in Puerto Rico, families living in Vieques continue to wait. The power authority has no current plans to restore the underwater cable that transmitted electricity from the Puerto Rico mainland to Vieques before Maria hit, instead aiming to put in place a new system using microgrids and renewable energy that could prove more resilient ahead of future storms.\n\nBut for now, the small island is running entirely on generators.\n\nIbia Santos is one of the many Vieques residents still reeling from the ripple effects of the storm as if it happened yesterday, struggling to rebuild and making up for economic losses. Santos owns a small business renting beach chairs and selling food to beachgoers.\n\nFor over a year, Santos has lacked a secure home since Maria brought down her house of nearly 20 years. The first few months, Santos tried to live among the home's debris. But unprecedented rashes, allergies and a rat infestation led Santos to set a camping tent near the beach. Since then, the tent has become her new temporary home.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was living in Jumanji,\u201d recalled Santos, referring to the movie where children brave a jungle full of animals and danger. \u201cAt least here in the beach I was able to feel better, in terms of my rash and my sinuses.\u201d\n\nAfter heavy rains, Santos needs to clean her tent\u2019s walls with chlorine. The rains leave \u201ca weird fungus-like thing\u201d around the tent, she explained.\n\nPeople like Vickie Michaud are trying to help Vieques residents like Santos through Hope Builders, a nonprofit organization that works to rebuild homes. So far, Hope Builders has a waiting list of about 300 people hoping to get the resources needed to reconstruct their destroyed houses.\n\n\u201cI think being an island off an island makes things extremely difficult. I've heard people refer to Vieques as the heck island, which just boggles my mind,\u201d Michaud said. \u201cThere's so many people in dire need of a home that's not leaking, not raining on them, that has windows.\u201d\n\nSix months after Hurricane Maria hit the island of Vieques, Ibia Santos left her rotting home to camp on the beach. She's been there ever since, slowly building up the campsite. Brock Stoneham / NBC News\n\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), more than 166,000 homes in Puerto Rico still need to be rebuilt. They don\u2019t know how many are waiting for repairs in Vieques specifically.\n\nHaronid Cruz Felix, director of communications for the municipality of Vieques, told NBC News that one of the main reasons why Vieques\u2019 recovery has been so slow is due to the low estimates FEMA came up with while assessing how much it would cost to repair post-hurricane damages.\n\nFEMA approved a little over $8 million in recovery funds for Vieques \u2014 which is essentially what the municipality lost in sales and the tax revenue known as IVU, as well as in damages to the public community health center, known by its Spanish initials, CDT. This is despite the fact that the federal agency stated that the small island had close to $400 million in total damages.\n\nVieques needs at least $65 million to repair homes in at least four different communities and other public infrastructure, according to municipal documents submitted to Puerto Rico\u2019s Housing Department as part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Development Block Grant-Disaster Recovery Program focused on home reparations and reconstruction, including vouchers and individual housing assistance.\n\nOfficials in Vieques are still waiting to hear back from federal authorities for the approval and disbursement of HUD and FEMA funds.\n\nFEMA financed a $2.9 million mobile dialysis center that was installed by the Puerto Rican government in early October. The center, which is set to start operating before the end of the year, would serve approximately 12 patients in need of such treatment who currently live in Vieques and have to travel multiple times a week to the mainland of Puerto Rico to receive treatment.\n\nCruz Felix said that before the hurricane at least two dozen dialysis patients lived in Vieques but \u201cmany died or moved to the U.S.\u201d after Hurricane Maria.\n\nIn the meantime, Puerto Rican public officials have thrown around the idea of prioritizing places like Vieques for new renewable energy installations, hoping to make Vieques and other parts of Puerto Rico more resilient and self-sufficient.\n\nCarlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, said in a press release, \u201cOur goal is that in five years 40 percent of our energy is generated from renewable sources, such as wind and solar.\u201d\n\nHowever, few details are outlined in Puerto Rico's plan to privatize the island power authority on how the government expects to do the transition.\n\nWhile Vieques\u2019 slow recovery continues without a clear end date, residents like Santos are clinging their hopes to the small improvements they see in their daily lives. For Santos, it\u2019s a small uptick in tourism.\n\n\u201cVieques is a tourist goldmine and that\u2019s because business owners like myself have done their part to do so,\u201d she said. \"Last time I checked the stats, like 10,000 people are expected to come during the winter.\u201d\n\nCruz Felix agreed with Santos that there has been tentative progress.\n\n\"It's true, it's starting to recover. But it's still too slow, \" said Cruz Felix about Vieques' tourism. \"The W Hotels and other hostelry still remain closed.\"\n\nIbia Santos' house was destroyed when Hurricane Maria hit the island of Vieques in 2017. Six months after the storm, suffering from skin and respiratory ailments, she decided to leave her home and has been camping on the beach ever since. Brock Stoneman / NBC News\n\nSantos said she has been able to gain back most of the extra money she spent in unexpected post-hurricane expenses, such as fuel to operate her generator and ice to keep food and provisions refrigerated.\n\nBut Santos still hasn\u2019t been able to put together enough money to rebuild her destroyed home.\n\nWith the help of Hope Builders, she\u2019s been able to fund raise $1,000, though that\u2019s still not enough for repairs, Santos said.\n\nAfter FEMA closed her case and she was unable to get housing repair aid, Santos \u201cdecided to not beg anymore and concentrate in my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I start to do good, and I know I will,\" said Santos, \"I\u2019m gonna start building my house (cement) block by block, little by little.\u201d\n\nNicole Acevedo reported from New York and Puerto Rico, and Nirma Hasty, Brock Stoneham and John Makely reported from Vieques.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Dan De Luce, Ken Dilanian and Robert Windrem\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Ritz-Carlton in Saudi Arabia's capital bills itself as an \"elegant oasis\" that \"completely envelops its discerning guests in majestic surroundings.\"\n\nBut a year ago Sunday, on Nov. 4, 2017, the ultra-luxurious Riyadh hotel \u2014 with its marble floors and vast indoor swimming pool \u2014 became a gilded prison, when hundreds of Saudi royals, billionaires and senior government officials were detained in an extraordinary power play by the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe involuntary guests were told they had to sign away large chunks of their assets to be released. The detention involved both psychological abuse and \u2014 in some cases \u2014 torture, current and former U.S. officials say.\n\nThe move, described by Saudi authorities as a crackdown on rampant corruption, allowed the crown prince to tighten his grip and sent a shock wave through the kingdom's elites.\n\n\"This was a shakedown operation and a power consolidation operation,\" said one former senior U.S. official who was in office at the time.\n\nThe Ritz detentions were designed \"to remind people going forward that their wealth and their well-being would depend on the crown prince and not anything else, which is why it was so upsetting for many in the royal family,\" said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nA year later, the event has taken on even more importance in the wake of the death of the Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Bin Salman is suspected of ordering Khashoggi's death, and is struggling to defuse the crisis that has put the country's international standing in jeopardy.\n\nIf bin Salman survives the fallout over the killing of Khashoggi, it will be in part due to the roundup at the Ritz, when he crushed his rivals and potential opponents. Some of those targeted included royals or officials linked to the late King Abdullah, who died in 2015. His relatives and associates are distrusted by the circle around King Salman, who now holds the throne.\n\nBut the crackdown generated deep resentment in the House of Saud and numerous enemies, experts and former officials said, and the crown prince could face more resistance from his internal adversaries. Bin Salman, keenly aware that Saudi Arabia's King Faisal was murdered by a disgruntled nephew in 1975, devotes elaborate attention to his personal security, one former U.S. intelligence officer told NBC News.\n\nThe details of exactly what happened to those detained at the Ritz have remained shrouded in secrecy, and the fate of those still held also remains unclear. A second hotel, the Courtyard by Marriott, located just across the street from the Ritz, was also used as a high-end detention center when space ran out at the Ritz. Both hotels were closed to the public during the operation. The Ritz did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA U.S. intelligence official and two former senior U.S. government officials told NBC News that the detainees were coerced, abused and tortured. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to divulge details, which were contained in classified intelligence reports.\n\nThe detainees were deprived of sleep, beaten and interrogated with their heads covered. Seventeen were hospitalized, according to the New York Times.\n\nOne detainee, a Saudi military officer, Maj. Gen. Ali al-Qahtani, died in custody. The Saudi authorities have yet to offer an official explanation in the case. He was a top aide to Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a son of the late King Abdullah.\n\nSaudi Arabia has denied that any abuse or torture took place during the detentions. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the time, President Donald Trump endorsed the crackdown in a tweet: \"I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing. Some of those they are harshly treating have been 'milking' their country for years!\"\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet came on Nov. 6, two days after the crackdown came to light. The next day the State Department said it would like to see prosecution of corruption in a \u201cfair and transparent manner.\u201d\n\nI have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2017\n\nTrump's apparent approval of the operation raises the question of whether Washington missed an opportunity to make clear to the crown prince last year that he needed to ease off of authoritarian measures or else risk a U.S. backlash, said a former senior government official with experience in the region:\n\n\"It should have been a warning to us where this was going,\" said the former official.\n\nAmong the nearly 400 detainees was Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a high-profile tycoon with investments in Citigroup and Apple, estimated to be worth more than $17 billion.\n\nAlwaleed was summoned to the royal court in the early morning hours of Nov. 4, having no inkling the crown prince had launched a sweeping roundup of the country's most powerful and wealthy figures.\n\nAlan Bender, a Canadian businessman with ties to the Saudi royal family, told NBC News he represented an ex-wife of Alwaleed, who had alleged she was mistreated by the billionaire. Before the November roundup, Bender had been pressing Alwaleed's lawyers to pay his client a financial settlement. After Alwaleed was detained, Bender was flown to Riyadh to \"testify\" against the prince. Bender said he did so via video-conference, reading a script of allegations while Alwaleed sat in an undisclosed location on the other end of the video chat.\n\nBender said it appeared that Alwaleed was in a room that resembled a jail cell, rather than a hotel suite. He also said al-Waleed seemed to be in rough shape, fatigued, unshaven and twitching.\n\n\"He looked like he hadn't slept,\" Bender said.\n\nWhile in Riyadh, Bender said, he learned more about the Ritz operation.\n\nBender said that a top adviser to the crown prince named Saud Al Qahtani \"bragged to me that they slapped and hung some detainees upside down.\" That same adviser has since been sacked, along with other top officials, after the killing of the Saudi dissident Khashoggi.\n\nAlwaleed was finally released after 83 days, looking underweight. In an interview with Bloomberg Television, Alwaleed insisted he was not mistreated and that he and the Saudi government had come to a \"confidential\" understanding. The prince did not respond to requests for comment by NBC News.\n\nLast month, Alwaleed appeared at an investment summit in Riyadh, with footage showing him sitting just a few seats away from the crown prince.\n\nSaudi businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, left, with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, second right, at the Saudi Arabia's investment conference, in Riyadh on Oct. 23, 2018. Fares Ghaith / EPA\n\nAfter the Ritz crackdown wound down, most remaining detainees were moved to Al Hayer jail, former U.S. officials said.\n\nSome of the former detainees have been placed under house arrest, are required to wear ankle monitors or are banned from travelling abroad, the former officials said.\n\nThe Saudi attorney general's office said in a statement in January that 381 individuals had been \"subpoenaed\" in corruption cases and 56 would remain in custody, because they \"refused to settle\" or they were subject to other pending criminal cases.\n\nSaudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, son of the late King Abdullah and head of the National Guard, a powerful 100,000-strong security force charged with protecting the royals, was released after three weeks in detention and after he reportedly agreed to pay more than $1 billion in a settlement.\n\nHis brother, Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province, remains under detention, the former officials said.\n\nThe Saudi government portrayed the whole clampdown as a successful effort to clean up corruption. Saudi authorities said in January that the government had reached settlements worth $106 billion. It's not clear how much of that is in the form of cash, and how much in real estate or other holdings, which could take months or years to transfer.\n\nThe government reportedly seized the management of some firms, including Saudi Binladin Group, the giant construction company founded by Osama bin Laden's father. The chairman, Bakr bin Laden, was among those detained last year. The company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEven before the Ritz detentions, the crown prince's impulsive ways had sparked jitters among foreign investors and the country's wealthy elite. Foreign direct investment has plunged in the past two years and Saudis have moved cash and assets out of the country at a dramatic rate.\n\nThe Ritz detentions only reinforced concerns for businesses looking at the Saudi market.\n\n\"The takeaway was if you get on the wrong side of this guy, then your investments and your deal could be at risk. That's a chilling message,\" said Phillip Cornell, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and former adviser to the kingdom's state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco.", "Get the Better newsletter.\n\nBy Vivian Manning-Schaffel\n\nFor the 100th year, we get to turn our clocks back an hour, alleviating the gloom of dark mornings but robbing us of daylit evenings.\n\nAccording to a recently added section of The Indoor Generation, a survey from YouGov and Velux, many of us feel less productive as the clocks roll back \u2014 74 percent of Americans say a lack of daylight affects their productivity, and 34 percent of Americans say a lack of daylight affects their productivity significantly.\n\nKevin Van Den Wymelenberg, Ph.D., associate professor and director of the Institute for Health in the Built Environment at the University of Oregon, says the human need for daylight is unconscious, but fundamental. \u201cThe rhythms of light and dark are a fundamental part of the ecological system that nearly every species on earth evolved within,\u201d he says. \u201cShould we really expect anything but an erosion of productivity if this natural system is severely disrupted?\u201d\n\nJohn Sharp, M.D., psychiatrist on faculty at Harvard Medical School and the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and author of \"The Emotional Calendar: Understanding Seasonal Influences and Milestones to Become Happier, More Fulfilled, and in Control of Your Life,\u201d also says less light in your day can cause things to slow down. \u201cThe interesting thing is, without light, our sleep wake cycle would be much longer than it is now. But it\u2019s the absence of light that sets us into our sleep-wake patterns,\u201d says Sharp. \u201cWhen that gets shifted, it really affects us and can cause people to be irritable, sleepy, and want to quit the day earlier. It\u2019s easier just to shut it all down at 5 p.m.\u201d\n\nA few countries in the European Union have led a hearty discussion in hopes of abolishing daylight saving all together. Some Northernmost countries, where it can be either light or dark for days on end depending on the time of year, cited health issues caused by the phenomenon \u2014 such as an eight percent increase in the risk of stroke and 24 percent increased risk of heart attack the Monday following spring forward. The only good news about turning the clock backward is, according to that same study, that extra hour of sleep coincides with a reduced risk of heart attack the following Monday by 21 percent.\n\nSo how can we better get ahead of the havoc daylight saving wreaks on our lives?\n\nEase into the sleep shift\n\nSharp says dialing back your bedtime by 15 minute increments can help you ease the transition. \u201cThink back to when you want to wake up and how much sleep you normally need, then gradually adjust your bedtime toward your sleep goal,\u201d he says.\n\nAvoid alcohol and refined carbs and sugar before bed\n\nAt least 20 percent of American adults rely on alcohol to help them fall asleep says Dr. Sanam Hafeez, clinical psychologist and teaching faculty member at Columbia University Teacher\u2019s College. Yet, she says imbibing the night before the clocks roll back is much more likely to hinder your sleep than help it. \u201cAlcohol disrupts circadian functioning, directly interfering with the ability of the master biological clock to synchronize itself,\u201d she explains. \u201cBecause circadian rhythms have such a powerful, dominating influence over the way our bodies function, the disruptive effects of alcohol can be widespread, affecting sleep and other systems, including liver function,\u201d she explains.\n\nSharp says though booze and carb-rich meals and snacks might be comforting come shorter days, there\u2019s a price to pay for overindulging \u2014 especially that night. \u201cEven if it relaxes you, you won\u2019t get the quality of sleep that makes you feel better during the day if you drink. And carbs sap energy because they metabolize into sugar and screw up your baseline metabolism and glucose production in a way that effects your energy and outlook,\u201d he says. So you might be better off saving the booze and sweets for the \u2018hygge\u2019 or \u2018c\u00f2sagach\u2019 inspired hibernation spells to come.\n\nGet out in the daylight\n\nHafeez says light suppresses the secretion of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin \u2014 and dark induces it. To better adjust to daylight saving time in fall, Hafeez advises exposing yourself to as much light as you can during the day. Even if it\u2019s chilly, a long walk outside can elevate your serotonin levels (and your mood), give you a dose of vitamin D \u2014 even boost your immune system, as we\u2019ve previously reported. Conversely, when night falls, Hafeez recommends avoiding bright light so you can fall asleep faster. \u201cFor example, if you get up at night to go to the bathroom, don\u2019t turn on the light,\u201d she explains.\n\nTo help recalibrate your circadian rhythms the Monday after the clocks roll back, Wymelenberg recommends, if at all possible, having your first morning meeting outside as a walk-and-talk. If not, try to take your laptop to a spot in your building by a sunny window.\n\nDon\u2019t sleep with your smartphone\n\nHafeez says your phone might mess with your sleep patterns more than you think \u2014 one study revealed that 68 percent of smartphone owners sleep either holding their smartphone, having it in bed with them, or on their nightstand. Says Hafeez: \u201cSo many people use their smartphones as their alarm clocks \u2014 it makes sense to want your phones within an arm\u2019s reach. But the temptation to check social media sites, work email or news headlines is often too strong to resist. As a result, you might feel energized from interacting with others, or stressed out by something that you read when you should actually be relaxing, which partly explains why people who consume electronic media in bed are at higher risk for insomnia.\u201d To quell the culprit, simply keep your phone in another room and set an old school alarm to wake up instead.\n\nAll these easy little tweaks can add up to make a big difference in terms of how your body adjusts to turning the clocks back, says Sharp. And if you can\u2019t make it to bed 15 minutes earlier, at least consider keeping your hands out of the cookie jar tonight.\n\nREADY TO GET MORE ZZZ\u2019S?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Adam Edelman\n\nLess than five months ago, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, promising a bold progressive agenda \u2014 including calls to abolish ICE \u2014 won a stunning upset in a House Democratic primary. Days later, fellow New York Democrats Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio joined her, demanding an end to the federal agency tasked with immigration enforcement. Others quickly linked themselves to the movement.\n\nBut now? With just days to go before the midterm elections, the \"Abolish ICE\" issue has all but vanished from the radar.\n\nThe topic, which had initially been forecast by some politicos as a hot new issue for Democrats, and a possible litmus test for candidates seeking support from the progressive wing of the party for 2020, is largely gone from rallies and speeches. That's due to what experts say is its failure to resonate with mainstream Democratic voters, a misplacing of blame for the nation's immigration crisis and a successful counter-attack from Republicans, including President Donald Trump.\n\nThe biggest factor in the Democrats' abandonment of the issue, Democratic strategists said, was that it deflected blame from those who they believe are responsible for creating a wave of new, harsh and divisive immigration policies. That includes the speeding up of deportation proceedings, an increasing number of arrests by ICE agents of undocumented immigrants, and the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy, which had resulted in the separation of families at the U.S. border.\n\nDemocratic Congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks at a rally against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh outside an expected speech by U.S. Representative Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in Boston, Massachusettes on October 1, 2018. Brian Snyder / Reuters file\n\n\"It let off the hook those who are truly responsible for the nation's immigration policies: President Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen,\" Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist at Rokk Solutions, told NBC News. \"A lot of voters just kind of understand that ICE officers are following new orders.\"\n\nMatt Angle, director of the progressive PAC the Lone Star Project, said: \"Democratic voters realized that ICE itself was not the problem. The problem was the policy and the officials behind it.\"\n\nIn June, as reports emerged that families were being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border, progressive Democrats began widely calling to \"abolish\" U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (known as ICE) \u2014 a 15-year-old federal agency under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security that was given broader authority by the Trump administration to arrest and deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nOne of the first was Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old Democratic Socialist who knocked off Rep. Joe Crowley, D-Queens, the No. 4 Democrat in the House, in a June Democratic primary. She was quickly followed by Gillibrand, de Blasio, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Reps. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., Jim McGovern, D-Mass., Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., Mike Capuano, D-Mass. and others.\n\nBut, amid attacks from Trump and crafty dares from congressional Republicans, most sprinted away from what had been initially seen as a robust rallying cry.\n\nTrump quickly went on the offense, tweeting over several summer days that \"the radical left Dems\" wanted to get rid of ICE. \"We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement,\" the president said. \"If you get rid of ICE, you're going to have a country that you\u2019re going to be afraid to walk out of your house.\"\n\nIt had an effect.\n\nPocan, for his part, initially said he'd planned to introduce a House bill that would abolish the agency within one year. But when GOP leaders, predicting the legislation would be a disaster for Democrats, threatened to schedule an immediate vote on it, Pocan and others supporting the bill retreated, saying they would have voted against their own legislation.\n\nGillibrand \u2014 who in June told CNN that Congress should \"get rid of\" ICE and \"start over\" \u2014 said at a debate against her Republican opponent Chele Farley in October that she only wanted to \"fix the broken system\" of ICE. Warren, who in late June had called for ICE to be abolished, echoed that in a debate against her own general election opponent last month, saying only, \"I want to see this agency reformed.\"\n\nA spokesman for Gillibrand said the senator's position on the issue \"hasn't changed.\" A spokeswoman for Warren said her position \"has remained consistent.\"\n\nEven Ocasio-Cortez, despite making \"Abolish ICE\" a major part of her campaign over the summer, has tweeted about the topic just twice since Sept. 1.

After their son and daughter went off to college, the empty nesters realized they wanted more from life than being in debt.\n\n\u201cWe knew we needed to do something because it wasn\u2019t going to get better,\u201d Tammy tells NBC News BETTER.\n\nThe Pennsylvania couple say they tried different techniques, but nothing worked. \u201cWe could never stay disciplined,\u201d says Dennis, a pastor at a church in Kingston, PA.\n\nThe couple eliminated their debt through what they call \u201cvisualization.\u201d\n\nThey combined the envelope system, a method of using visualization to stow away extra cash, with the debt snowball method, where you pay more than your minimum payment on your credit cards.\n\nThe couple also made moves to reduce their spending. They began eating less expensive meals, and cut back on things they didn\u2019t need, like cable. They say switching to an antenna, which provided 20 channels for free, saved them a big chunk of cash each month.\n\nHow the envelope system works\n\nFigure out the categories where you tend to spend the most. For example: Mortgage, savings, car payment, bills, credit cards. Designate an envelope for each category.\n\nEvery time you have extra cash, you\u2019ll put a percentage in each envelope. How much will depend on your unique needs.\n\nFor example,\n\nMortgage: 50 percent\n\nSavings: 10 percent\n\nCar payment: 10 percent\n\nBills: 10 percent;\n\nCredit cards: 20 percent\n\nTammy, a missionary, says the envelope system allowed them to see what steps they needed to take to get out of debt.\n\n\u201cIt just became very clear how to make the money work,\u201d she says.\n\nTammy says using an electronic version of the system allowed her to automate money from her paychecks directly into each category.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to think about it, once you designate that\u2019s how you want to break it down,\u201d she says.\n\nCombining the snowball method\n\nAfter sitting down with a financial coach, the Grays say they were shocked to see how much money they were paying in interest on credit card debt.\n\n\u201cI remember crying,\u201d says Tammy.\n\n\u201cWhat opened up our eyes was how much interest we paid on the credit card alone, not counting the principal,\u201d adds Dennis. \u201cThat really motivated us to pay it off quickly.\u201d\n\nThe Grays began to apply the \u201csnowball method\u201d to paying down their massive credit card debt.\n\nThe method requires you to pay more than what you owe on your minimum monthly credit card payments. How much you contribute will depend on your unique needs and circumstances. The key is to continue paying it off at the same amount or more, even as the amount you owe decreases.\n\nOver time, the Grays\u2019 credit card debt began to go down, which means they could increase the amount they contributed to paying off their debt.\n\nAfter five years, they made their last credit card payment in September.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an amazing feeling,\u201d says Tammy.\n\nNow that their credit card debt is eliminated, the couple is focused on paying off their home loan. Since they no longer have to pay off credit cards, they can afford to double the monthly payments to their their mortgage.\n\nThe couple say their son and his wife, recently married, plan to use the same system to manage their own money.\n\n\u201cMy heart is very emotional that they won\u2019t go through what we did,\u201d Tammy says.\n\nMORE SAVINGS HACKS\n\nWant more tips like these?

Three weeks before each election, all of Oregon's nearly 2.7 million registered voters are sent a ballot by the U.S. Postal Service. Then they mark and sign their ballots and send them in.\n\nYou don't have to ask for the ballot, it just arrives. There are no forms to fill out, no voter i.d., no technology except paper and stamps. If you don't want to pay for a stamp, you can drop your ballot in a box at one of the state's hundreds of collection sites.\n\nIt's a system that consistently produces some of the highest voter participation rates in the country. In 2016, 68 percent of the state's registered voters voted, eight percent above the national average. The Oregon way is also endorsed across party lines. Current Secretary of State Dennis Richardson, a Republican, and one of his predecessors, Phil Keisling, a Democrat, agree that it gets people to vote and is cheaper and more secure than machines and polling places.\n\n\"You can't hack paper,\" said Richardson.\n\n\"Isn't that amazing in its simplicity?\" said Keisling. \"Give everyone their ballot and then let them decide where they want to mark it, whether they want to mark it at all.\"\n\nFilled-out Oregon paper ballots being sorted by election workers. NBC News\n\nKeisling, who pushed for voting by mail as secretary of state in the 1990s, says that in-person voting can actually discourage people from voting, especially now that 32 states have some kind of voter i.d. requirement.\n\n\"I think polling places have become the single biggest voter suppression device in American politics,\" said Keisling.\n\nRichardson said the Oregon way removes the \"pressure of being in a voting booth.\"\n\nWashington and Colorado also have mail-only elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Twenty-two states promote some elections as \"all-mail,\" but they don't preclude in-person voting, the conference says.\n\nOregonians instituted vote-by-mail in a 1998 ballot measure that passed by more than two-to-one, and since then opinion polls have consistently shown overwhelming public support for the system from all voters, regardless of party.\n\nCurrent Oregon Secretary of State Dennis Richardson, a Republican, and one of his predecessors, Phil Keisling, a Democrat. NBC News\n\nYoung people, the demographic of registered voters least likely to show up on Election Day, apparently like vote by mail as well. In the 2014 election, says Keisling, records showed that 45 percent of registered voters 34 and under marked a ballot \u2014 twice the level of many other states.\n\nBut what about security? You can't hack paper, but you can steal ballots. Couldn't someone swipe a ballot from a neighbor's mailbox, or from someone who has moved or died?\n\nKeisling acknowledges this could happen, but says it would be \"one of the stupidest ways to try to steal an election.\"\n\n\"They'd be committing a felony, vote by vote.\"\n\n\"A clerk once asked me to think about this,\" recalled Keisling, \"He said, 'Phil, have you wondered why crooks don't counterfeit pennies? They go for the twenties and the hundreds if they're going to risk the jail time.\"\n\n'Throw them on the scrap pile'\n\nIn order to make sure voter rolls are up to date, Oregon election officials rigorously comb death notices, change of address forms, even track social security records.\n\nBallots can be returned by mail, but the majority of marked ballots are returned via the state's hundreds of secure drop sites. According to election officials, younger voters say they don't like to use the post office.\n\nOnce they've been collected and brought to one of 36 county election offices around the state, all ballots are checked for authenticity. Each signature is verified against voter registration cards. The authenticated ballots then go to the vote tallying room to be counted.\n\nAs a final security feature, a voter can ask for a text confirming that his or her ballot was counted.\n\nThe tally from each county election office is sent to the secretary of state's office in the state capital of Salem.\n\nKeisling says other states now dealing with aging voting technology should not replace those machines, but \"throw them on the scrap pile.\"\n\n\"Go back to paper ballots,\" he said. \"Then think hard \u2026 You ought to be looking at abolishing the polling place and moving to a system that puts the voter first.\"", "Get the Mach newsletter.\n\nBy Tom Metcalfe\n\nSolar eclipses are among the most dramatic astronomical events around \u2014 just ask anyone who\u2019s seen one. For a few minutes, a black disk seems to move across the sun, and daylight slowly gives way to an eerie darkness as the temperature falls.\n\nThe awesome spectacle affects wildlife as well as humans, changing the behavior of birds, cows, insects and other animals. But then, as quickly as it came, the darkness lifts and the sun shines again with its usual strength.\n\nSolar eclipses, or eclipses of the sun, are rare events in part because each is visible only from a limited area of Earth\u2019s surface. Parts of the U.S. saw a total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017 \u2014 and the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. won\u2019t come until 2024.\n\nWhat causes a solar eclipse?\n\nSolar eclipses occur when the moon comes between Earth and the sun, blocking sunlight from our host star.\n\n\u201cIt's when the moon's orbit brings it directly between us and the sun, so it casts a shadow on us,\u201d says astronomer Caleb Scharf, director of Columbia University's Astrobiology Center in New York City. \u201cSince the moon is much smaller than Earth, the shadow is only about 100 miles across, but it sweeps over the Earth's surface.\u201d\n\nPeople near the center of the moon\u2019s shadow \u2014 what\u2019s called the umbra \u2014 see a total solar eclipse, in which almost all of the sun\u2019s light is blocked. People near the edges of the shadow, in a region called the penumbra, see a partial solar eclipse, meaning that the sun is only partly obscured.\n\nDuring so-called annular eclipses, a ring of sunlight appears around the dark disk of the moon.\n\nA lucky coincidence\n\nSolar eclipses occur only because of a celestial coincidence: though the sun\u2019s diameter is about 400 times that of the moon, the sun also lies about 400 times further away. \u201cThe moon appears almost the same size in the sky as the sun, so Earth experiences nearly perfect solar eclipses,\u201d Scharf says.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case in Earth\u2019s distant past, which stretches back more than 4 billion years. In our planet\u2019s early days, the moon was much closer than it is now. Millions of years from now, as the moon\u2019s orbit gradually widens, our satellite will be farther away. That means eclipses won\u2019t be quite the same.\n\n\u201cIt'll look smaller,\u201d Scharf says of the moon, \u201cand so eclipses will never be total again.\u201d\n\nHow often do solar eclipses occur?\n\nOn average, there are two total solar eclipses somewhere on Earth every three years. But some years there are no total solar eclipses, and the average time between total solar eclipses in one place is more than 300 years. That\u2019s because the moon\u2019s orbit around Earth is slightly tilted compared to Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun. \u201cIt's either too high or too low compared to Earth's orbital plane,\u201d Scharf says. \u201cSo we have to wait for those times when it does just line up right.\u201d\n\nA related phenomenon occurs when Earth\u2019s shadow falls on the surface of the moon. Because our planet\u2019s shadow is much bigger than the moon\u2019s, lunar eclipses occur more frequently than solar eclipses \u2014 usually two times a year.\n\nSolar eclipses in history\n\nThe first successful prediction of a solar eclipse is attributed to the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus in 585 B.C. The eclipse was visible in Asia Minor \u2014 roughly the region occupied by Turkey on today\u2019s maps \u2014 and was said to occur during a battle between the Medes and Lydians, who were so awed by the spectacle that they agreed to a truce after years of war.\n\nIn ancient times, solar eclipses were often interpreted as bad omens for royal dynasties. In Assyria, a substitute king and queen would be installed for the day of an eclipse. The unfortunate pair would be executed after the eclipse.\n\nSolar eclipses have also served to advance scientific research. One of the most notable instances came in 1919, when English astronomer Arthur Eddington used the apparent locations of stars near the eclipsed sun to test Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity.\n\n\u201cEddington was just able to measure how the distant stars seemed to shift their positions because of the mass of the sun distorting space,\u201d Scharf says. \u201cIt was one of the things that made relativity famous.\u201d\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT ASTRONOMY?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Yes, all those negative campaign ads will soon be going away.\n\nWith just days to go, there has already been more than $2.7 billion spent to flood the airwaves with ads in battles for the House, Senate and governor's mansions this cycle.\n\nIn such a flood of television ads, especially in states filled with competitive races up and down the ballot, it's not easy for candidates to stand out on the airwaves. But this cycle, we've seen a few candidates and political groups stand out, either with unique ways of sharing their message or with biting attacks that prompted a second look.\n\nHere are 14 of the most interesting ads of campaign 2018:\n\nJoe Manchin shoots the GOP healthcare lawsuit\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's September spot is a perfect example of how the campaign messaging has changed on health care, even in GOP-leaning states. For years, many Democrats ran as far away from the Affordable Care Act as they could, while Republicans won seats away from red-state Democrats. But the calculus is different now, and Democrats like Manchin are turning the issue into a chance to play offense.\n\nIn this ad, Manchin returns to his famous 2010 spot where he took on his own party's cap-and-trade bill by shooting it. But this time, he's taking literal aim at a popular target for Democrats \u2014 a GOP-backed lawsuit that wants to strike down key provisions of the ACA.\n\nRon DeSantis teaches his child to \"build the wall\"\n\nWhile dozens of GOP races revolved around candidates jockeying to be seen as the best embodiment and supporter of President Donald Trump, perhaps nothing exemplified that trend better than the Florida gubernatorial primary.\n\nRepublican Rep. Ron DeSantis skyrocketed to the top of the polls on the strength of Trump's support alone, stepping over the beaten-down campaign of Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner, who was long seen as the party's \"anointed one.\"\n\nIn this spot, which came out weeks before the primary, DeSantis's campaign jokes about the lengths to which DeSantis had gone to bear-hug Trump.\n\nElissa Slotkin shares story of mother's pre-existing condition struggles\n\nDemocrats aren't just weaponizing the health care battle \u2014 they've also sought to connect with would-be constituents with personal stories about their own struggles with illness or insurance.\n\nMichigan Democrat Elissa Slotkin's spot does just that, telling the heart-wrenching story of her mother, who lost her health care and subsequently died from ovarian cancer. The spot includes footage of her dying mother toasting Slotkin and her new husband at their wedding, which she says they rushed because of her condition.\n\nBrian Kemp is \"so conservative\"\n\nGeorgia Republican Brian Kemp mounted his own come-from-behind victory in Georgia's GOP gubernatorial primary thanks to an ardent conservative message and an embrace of Trump.\n\nHis ads unabashedly pushed the envelope, including this one, which features him triggering an explosion, showing off his gun collection, and telling viewers he can help deport undocumented immigrants in his truck. The hard-right primary strategy paid off in the primary, but it's set up an interesting dynamic for his general-election fight against Stacey Abrams, the Democrat.\n\nAmy McGrath makes waves with first ad\n\nKentucky Democrat Amy McGrath caught fire as one of the handful of first-time Democratic candidates who turned viral campaign ads into serious fundraising hauls that legitimized their candidacies quickly.\n\nIn this spot, McGrath introduces voters to the story of her push to become a combat fighter pilot, arguing she'll take that same intensity to Congress. That biography helped her edge out a better-known Democrat in the primary, and kept her race against Republican Andy Barr well within her sights.\n\nThe ad initially gained traction on social media, a path also taken by Democrats like Randy Bryce, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and MJ Hegar.\n\nThe NRCC warns of \"government-run\" health care\n\nRepublicans have gone all-out to hold Democrats accountable for the party's flirtation with single-payer-health care or \"Medicare for All,\" which is becoming more and more popular on the left. In doing so, they've hit candidates whether or not they openly embrace the issue.\n\nThis ad is a great example \u2014 it targets New Mexico Democrat Xochitl Torres Small, who has said she wants to make \"affordable health care accessible to everyone\" but doesn't endorse single-payer. Even so, the NRCC is airing a tough spot that shows a mother calling her doctor for an emergency with a sick child, only to be told that their doctor doesn't accept her health care thanks to the new government-run system. The group is rolling that spot out to other races as well to make a similar point.\n\nConor Lamb distances himself from Pelosi\n\nPennsylvania Democrat Conor Lamb made it cool for Democratic candidates to break with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a longtime villain in GOP campaign ads.\n\nLamb neutralized the Pelosi argument early by coming out for new Democratic leadership if elected, and he continued to reinforce that position throughout his victorious effort in last spring's special election campaign. Now, we've seen more than 50 Democratic candidates say they wouldn't back Pelosi for speaker, although Republicans have pushed back on the claim by questioning what these candidates would do if Pelosi is the party's choice for speaker on the House floor next year.\n\nNRSC tries to nationalize Tennessee Senate race\n\nThe Tennessee Senate race has proven tough for Republicans to put away despite the state's GOP tilt. Democrat Phil Bredesen, the state's former governor, led GOP Rep.

I would lose. If it's, 'Do you want to send Phil Bredesen or Marsha Blackburn to Washington?' I think I can win that.\"\n\nIt seems like Republicans are getting the message, as the attacks have already started warning Republicans about the dangers of him being elected.\n\nJoe Donnelly touts praise from President Trump\n\nRed-state Democratic senators like Indiana's Joe Donnelly have been trying to walk a thin line in mobilizing the Democratic base to turn out for them in November while navigating the fact that Trump won their states by a landslide.\n\nDonnelly has tried to do that in a variety of ways this cycle, including an ad touting support for Trump's immigration policies and his border bill, as well as this spot that includes video of Trump thanking him for his work on a new law that opens up experimental drugs to those with serious illnesses.\n\nDuncan Hunter evokes opponent's terrorist grandfather\n\nIn arguably the most divisive ad from any major candidate this cycle, California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter references his \"Palestinian Mexican millennial Democrat\" opponent, former Department of Labor official Ammar Campa Najjar, who the ad claims is trying to \"infiltrate\" Congress.\n\nIt also brings up his opponent's grandfather, one of the terrorists who attacked the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Campa-Najjar's grandfather died before he was born.\n\nThe spot drew a harsh rebuke from Campa-Najjar, whose campaign also pointed out that Hunter was recently indicted for misusing more than $250,000 in campaign dollars.\n\nPaul Gosar's family begs Arizonans to vote him out\n\nNot getting along with a family member is common.

Martha McSally and her allies launched a tough line of attack on Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, effectively questioning her patriotism.\n\nMcSally's campaign effectively made a meme out of the pink tutu that Sinema wore while protesting the Iraq War, unveiling it in this ad as it sought to rally conservatives and veterans to help her keep Arizona's Senate seat red.\n\nHeidi Heitkamp defends Kavanaugh \"no\" vote in deep-red state\n\nThe fallout related to Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation and the accusations of sexual assault levied against him may be resonating the strongest in North Dakota, where Republicans are confident Heitkamp's vote will make it easier for them to dethrone her.\n\nThe Democrats campaign is trying to inoculate her with a direct-to-camera spot justifying her vote, which typifies how the Kavanaugh vote has set up a tough set of circumstances for Heitkamp and her fellow red-state Democrats who voted against the new justice.\n\nPresident Trump's re-election campaign makes sale to suburban voters\n\nThe president isn't officially on the ballot, but even he's well aware that the midterms will be seen, in part as a referendum on his presidency. That's why his re-election campaign launched an unusual $6 million television buy across the country that frames the election as a choice between prosperity and uncertainty.\n\nThe spot is running in states with key races up and down the ballot, like California, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee, Minnesota, North Dakota and Iowa.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Karamo Brown, culture expert/resident therapist on \"Queer Eye\"\n\nAs a child, I rarely saw my father go to the doctor. No matter how sick he was, there was always a tendency to wait it out or use basic remedies, like over the counter medicines that often could not address more serious complications.\n\nWhen I was in college, I made similar mistakes when it came to not seeking the best care that I needed. As a student, I turned to alcohol and drugs to cope with the stress many teenagers face in their day-to-day lives. For me, it was a normal thing to get drunk and use drugs \u2014 as long as I was getting my work done, things seemed like they were OK. This trend continued for years until, one day, things got serious enough that an intervention was warranted.\n\nConcerned for my safety and well-being, a close friend and college roommate got in touch with my mother and sounded the alarm bells; I was in a vulnerable mental space which required the care of loved ones and the guidance of professionals.\n\nFor me and my father, it wasn't (just) a reflection of a certain kind of tough-it-out masculinity that kept us from seeking the care we needed. Going to the doctor meant engaging with the bureaucracy that controls most Americans' access to health care. I witnessed what my parents went through with insurance agencies while trying to receive government assistance: Long phone calls, countless rejection letters, skyrocketing bills and sleepless nights wondering how we were going to access critical treatment.\n\nAnd so, for most of my early childhood and adult life, I embraced the same approach regardless of the severity of my mental or physical illness. I can recall many moments when I lay in bed sick, literally unable to carry out basic tasks because I opted to stay home instead of visiting the doctor to seek care. I didn\u2019t believe access to quality, affordable health care was something to which I was entitled, let alone anything I could achieve.\n\nLike millions of Americans across the country, I struggled with gaining access to quality, affordable health care because I didn't know my rights, what I deserved or even how to go about getting it. It wasn\u2019t until I was in my mid-to-late 20s that I even obtained a primary care doctor, and only then because I realized that access to health care was my right, not a privilege. As I got older, I knew that I had to more fully embrace my responsibility of understanding the state of my health care because I was determined to shape my own future.\n\nIn August, I revealed that I once attempted suicide, back in 2006; I was in a place that wasn\u2019t healthy and I suffered silently and alone. This episode was serious enough that I took the necessary steps to seek the professional help and treatment that I needed. My advocacy around mental health support is very much rooted in my own personal story.\n\nMental health and general wellness are often overlooked because they aren't something you can necessarily see, the way you can a broken bone or a case of the flu. I had to seek the treatment I needed to get better and, once I got through it, it inspired me to do more to help other Americans improve the quality of their lives as well.\n\nMy health care story isn\u2019t that unique, but it is very much a part of who I am. Getting involved in promoting access to health care is so important to me because it is personal. So many Americans struggle with the fear and stigma associated with seeking health care, whether mental health care or wellness care, particularly in the Black LGBTQ+ community. Studies show that \"sexual minority women and LGBTQ people of color report worse health status, more unmet healthcare needs, and perceived and actual discrimination or substandard care than sexual minority men and White, LGBTQ people.\" Other studies show that a significant proportion of LGBTQ+ people rely on community health centers for their medical care, but 13 states lack such centers.\n\nRecent studies show there is currently a shortage of primary care doctors and that number is only exacerbated when you consider key factors that impact communities of color disproportionately. Studies show that African Americans are less likely to access primary care because of socioeconomic factors, like access to health insurance, and residential segregation, which can make primary care physicians more difficult to access.\n\nAs a father, a mental health professional and an openly gay Black man, I\u2019ve used my platform to uplift issues that impact folks like me every single day, including HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention and mental health and wellness advocacy. I am dedicated to using my platform to bring awareness to issues that are often omitted in conversations about access to quality health care and ongoing health disparities in the LGBTQ+ community and in communities of color.\n\nFor instance, in 2016, I co-founded 6in10, an organization dedicated to ending the disparities in new HIV diagnosis rates among Black gay and bisexual men \u2014 six in 10 of whom were once expected to be diagnosed as positive by the age of 40 \u2014 by providing tailored mental health support through viral campaigns and community engagement. (This organization has now been absorbed by a larger agency with more resources.)\n\nThese are issues that I believe need to be at the forefront in the debate to protect access to quality, affordable health care, but neither can improve without that access. That is why I have joined the Health Care Voter campaign as a new co-chair to help mobilize voters for November 6.\n\nI\u2019m a proud father of two sons who are the joys of my life, and I believe we must all continue to do our part to make this world a better place for the next generation. This November, please join me in holding our lawmakers accountable in protecting our right to health care. So many lives depend on it.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Ani Bundel\n\nOne day, someone will make the biopic Freddie Mercury deserves. Today is not that day.\n\nOn paper, \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d seems like it should be a fantastic film. It has a complex and wildly talented genius, cut down before his time by a plague the homophobic Western world refused to take seriously. It has the music of Queen, which is still as fresh and thrilling as when it was first written. It has casting that ranged from impeccable to inspired in the case of Rami Malek.\n\nSo what went wrong? How could the story of one of the most fascinating figures in rock music descend into a color-by-numbers tale more suitable for VH1 than the Academy Awards?\n\nThe answer has a lot to do with the film\u2019s origins. The project spent nearly a decade kicking around Hollywood, with Sacha Baron Cohen attached to play the singer back in 2010. Already recognized for his singing talent in \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d and at the time getting ready to co-star in the film adaptation of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d he seemed a perfect fit. But after three years and little progress, Cohen walked away from the part.\n\nThe problem, as he explained it, stemmed from the keepers of Queen\u2019s musical rights, Brian May and Roger Taylor. May and Taylor \u2014 Queen's guitarist and drummer, respectively \u2014 had a very different movie in mind, one where they were the main stars and Freddie\u2019s ordeal was something they\u2019d overcome on the way to even more greatness. The film then languished until Rami Malek was hired to take on the part of Mercury. But Malek clashed with the director Bryan Singer; one day Singer too walked off the set and never came back.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" reduces Mercury to just another fallen rock and roller, with no grasp of what makes his story so triumphant and also so tragic.\n\nThe movie was completed by the assistant directors, and thankfully it did not end up being totally filtered through the hazy memories of Mercury\u2019s remaining bandmates. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a great film, or even a good one. In the end, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" reduces Mercury to just another fallen rock and roller, with no grasp of what makes his story so triumphant and also so tragic.\n\nTake for instance the opening vignette, where Brian May and Roger Taylor are portrayed as two dudes in a perfectly good band who take on Mercury on of necessity. In subsequent scene after scene, with managers, lawyers and record executives, Taylor and May are seen politely sitting on the couch, sipping tea, while Mercury is portrayed as a difficult diva. Not that May and Taylor disagreed with Mercury's music \u2014 they knew enough to go along with his genius. (So did bassist John Deacon, who, unlike May and Taylor, is not listed as an executive producer of the film, perhaps explaining why he winds up as an afterthought in many scenes.) The result is a movie that feels desperate to portray Taylor and May as the steady, responsible musicians who tried (and failed) to save their friend from himself.\n\nQueen onstage during a live concert performance at Ahoy Hall in Rotterdam, Netherlands in April 1978. Fin Costello / Redferns/Getty Images\n\nThis is tragic, because Malek is so good as Mercury. Like, career-defining good. Moreover, the rest of the cast does a great job in support of Malek. You will believe Gwilym Lee is Brian May\u2019s younger self and Ben Hardy does a great job as Taylor\u2019s egotistic counterpart to Mercury. Only Joseph Mazzello as Deacon doesn\u2019t always come off as believable; once he loses the early 1970s wig, though, he improves enormously. And then of course, there\u2019s the genius stunt casting of Mike Myers as the EMI record exec who insists long-haired hooligan teens won\u2019t rock out to the song \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d in their cars, a perfect homage to 1992\u2019s \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d use of the song.\n\nBut the acting can\u2019t hide the film\u2019s substantial plot flaws. As Mercury descends into drugs and debauchery, the other band members are shown looking uncomfortable and confused. They are heterosexual foils to his free-loving free spirit.\n\nSpeaking of which, the film\u2019s issues with Mercury's sexuality are glaring. Early on, Mercury is shown to be madly in love with a woman, Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton). She is portrayed as a stabilizing influence, and during their relationship Mercury's music is great. But once Mercury starts exploring his sexuality, he starts to slip. High and in the thrall of manager Paul Prenter (Allen Leech, playing very against his best known \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d role), Mercury makes a series of bad decisions culminating in Queen nearly missing out on the opportunity to perform at Live Aid. In other words, the film seems to suggest that gay clubs can lead to drugs which can lead to increasingly poor choices and, eventually, AIDS. Nancy Reagan would give this film the D.A.R.E. seal of approval.\n\nEven worse, the film leads with this plotline. Mercury is shown telling the band he has HIV one week before their Live Aid performance. Even for this genre, the historical revisionism feels particularly egregious, inserted to make the other bandmates seem compassionate, yet stoic. Live Aid happened in 1985, but Mercury was not believed to have been diagnosed until 1987. The movie attempts to insist his scene-stealing performance at Live Aid was a final hurrah of glory in the face of certain death. In truth, it was just Freddie being Freddie, doing his thing on stage.\n\nThat the people behind this movie are too unimaginative to understand this simple fact encapsulates so many of the problems with the film. In re-staging the Live Aid performance in full (it takes up the final 20 minutes, the movie captures what made Mercury such an electric performer. But it also throws into sharp relief how little the rest of the film understood about what made him so special.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

We cannot help laughing at such a foolish idea,\" it said. The ministry described the lifting of U.S.-led sanctions as corresponding action to the North's \"proactive and good-will measures,\" apparently referring to its unilateral suspension of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and closure of a nuclear testing ground.\n\nFollowing a series of provocative nuclear and missile tests last year, Kim shifted to diplomacy when he met with Trump between three summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who lobbied hard to revive nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Seoul.\n\nHowever, the North has been playing hardball since the summit. It's insisting that sanctions should be lifted before any progress in nuclear talks, which fueled doubts on whether Kim would ever deal away a nuclear program he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival.\n\nMoon has described inter-Korean engagement as crucial to resolving the nuclear standoff.\n\nBut South Korea's enthusiasm for engagement with its rival has also created discomfort in the United States amid growing concerns that the North is dragging its feet with its promise to denuclearize.\n\nStill, Friday's statement should not be taken as a sign that the promise will indeed be broken, experts said.\n\n\"North Korea is not going to break the promise at this point,\" said Dr. Koh Yu Whan, a professor of North Korea studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.\n\nPyongyang \"has been complaining that their efforts made so far regarding denuclearization efforts have not been appreciated,\" Dr. Koh said, and so wants \"to vent their complaints out loud.\"\n\n\"I don't think that the threats to resume developing nuclear and missiles at this point and juncture are serious,\" he added.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Reuters polling found that in October only 25 percent of people aged 18 to 29 said they were certain to vote in the election, the lowest percentage of any age bracket.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt on Friday added their voices to the campaign to get out the vote.\n\n\"This election might be the most consequential of our lifetime,\" DiCaprio said in a video message with Pitt released on social media, mentioning issues like gun control, the environment and immigration, without referencing any political party.\n\nWhile the organizers of Monday's event say it is a nonpartisan effort, increased turnout among young voters could help Democrats. Forty percent of people in that age group identified as Democrats, while 22 percent called themselves Republicans.\n\nJane Fonda, Charlize Theron, Judd Apatow and others will participate in the telethon. Created by comedian Ben Gleib, the telethon will be streamed live from a YouTube production space outside Los Angeles on YouTube, Facebook Live and Comedy Central's website.\n\nViewers will be directed to information about how and where to vote in the elections.\n\nThe elections, widely viewed as a referendum on Republican President Donald Trump, represent a chance for Democrats to break his party's hold on Congress. Opinion polls show Democrats with a good shot at picking up the net 23 seats they need for a majority in the House of Representatives, but only a slim chance of winning back the Senate.\n\nThe telethon could add momentum to a trend already underway: there has been a surge in early voting this year by young voters. Initial estimates modeled from survey responses, voter registrations and other data show huge increases in early turnout of voters ages 18 to 29 compared with the last midterm elections in 2014.\n\nWhile Hollywood is known for backing liberal causes, and many celebrities are fierce critics of Trump, organizers said the telethon is not supporting any party.\n\nHandler, a registered independent who is supporting Democrats in this election, said she will not take jabs at Trump during the event.\n\n\"This is about unification,\" Handler said. \"This is about encouraging everyone to vote. Listen, I want Republicans to vote, too.\"\n\nThe telethon is backed by When We All Vote, a nonpartisan campaign launched by former first lady Michelle Obama to encourage voting.\n\nIt is unclear how much celebrities influence voting, but there is evidence of sway in some cases. Website Vote.org said 413,000 new voters registered in the first four days after pop superstar Taylor Swift in early October urged fans to register, up from 190,000 in the month of September.\n\nFonda, who is 80 and was famous in her youth for her anti-Vietnam War activism, said she hopes young people will recognize what is at stake.\n\n\"More than any other election that I can remember, this particular election is going to determine whether we can continue to call ourselves a democracy, whether we're going to be able to live in a country of people that are different from each other and truly get along and love each other,\" she said.\n\nHandler said she will encourage people to make a plan for voting and to bring friends and make it fun.\n\n\"We just have to get people revved up to be part of the cool kids,\" she added. \"It's cool to vote.\"", "How to make your small business a community staple copied!\n\nAnn Cantrell, founder of Annie\u2019s Blue Ribbon General Store in Brooklyn, New York, shares her tips for building a successful small business and getting involved in the community.\n\nRead More", "Two taken to Oregon hospital after eating Halloween candy laced with meth copied!\n\nTwo Oregon parents were taken to a hospital Thursday after unknowingly eating methamphetamine-laced gummy candy their children received while trick-or-treating.
