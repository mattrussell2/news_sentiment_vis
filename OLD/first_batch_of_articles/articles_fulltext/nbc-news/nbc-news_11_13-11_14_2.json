At the time, it was in the throes of a financial crisis, owing billions to creditors without the cash to pay off the debt.\n\nSome 3,000 people are estimated to have died from the hurricane and its aftermath. The hurricane destroyed Puerto Rico's electrical grid and infrastructure and forced some businesses to close for months or shut down completely, wreaking more havoc on the island's already gasping economy.\n\nTrump\u2019s request was first reported by Axios, which said he had apparently misread an article in The Wall Street Journal and believed the island's government would improperly use relief funds to pay down its debt.\n\nThe president had also claimed in an October tweet that the island was using restructuring and recovery money to pay its debt.\n\nBut neither Puerto Rican officials nor the fiscal board overseeing its financial recovery have ever publicly said they plan to use federal money to directly pay bondholders, and any such plan would have to be approved by Congress.\n\nTrump's plan has drawn angry rebukes, with critics saying his charge about the debt is not based on any evidence, while others have scoffed at his understanding of the government process.\n\n\u201cThis may be a constitutional lesson for the president, but it\u2019s Congress that allocates funding and through oversight power can make sure (Puerto Rico\u2019s) using it for disaster relief,\u201d said Rep. Darren Soto, D.-Fla.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said he wasn\u2019t going to comment on \u201crumors,\u201d the Puerto Rico newspaper El Vocero reported Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf there is something concrete to say about Puerto Rico then he can say it,\u201d Rossell\u00f3 told the newspaper. \u201cIf not, we keep working.\u201d\n\nRossell\u00f3\u2019s office did not respond to an NBC request for comment.\n\nThe White House, responding to NBC's request for comment, said it had allocated $91 billion in aid to Puerto Rico, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. There was no comment on whether the president requested an end to spending on Puerto Rico.\n\nA congressional aide for the House Appropriations Committee said the committee had not received any \"such instruction or information.\" The aide said the committee is working \"to determine what may be needed for all disasters and emergencies, to determine if and when more funding is necessary.\"\n\nDemocrats on the House and Senate Appropriations committees said they had not been informed of such a request from Trump beyond what had been reported by Axios.\n\nTrump has stumbled a few times when it comes to Puerto Rico. His administration has been criticized for its slow response to the island after the hurricane. Trump was ridiculed for throwing paper towels to Puerto Ricans during a visit to the island and for denying the death toll was 3,000.\n\nPuerto Rico experts said the president appears to be confused about what is happening with Puerto Rico\u2019s attempt to restructure its debt and the role played by the federal investment in the island\u2019s reconstruction.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he really understands what is going on. I think he is mixing two different things,\u201d said Federico de Jes\u00fas, a consultant at FDJ Solutions who has worked on Puerto Rico issues. \u201cHe\u2019s engaging in the same victim blaming. Either he doesn\u2019t know the need or doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nDavid Ferreira, a consultant at Ferreira Strategies, said that the money Congress appropriated for Puerto Rico's reconstruction could only be diverted by Puerto Rican officials for something else with the approval of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.\n\nFurthermore, Ferreira said, if Republicans decided to comply with Trump's request to withhold money from Puerto Rico, it would \"come \"at a great cost\" because Democrats will control the House in January.\n\n\"Is hurting Puerto Rico really a priority for the Republicans in Congress? I don't think it is,\" Ferreira said.\n\nTo help Puerto Rico out of its financial crisis, Congress set up a fiscal control board in 2017 to deal with the island's debt, implement spending cuts and oversee its budget.\n\nPresident Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on Oct. 3, 2017. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters file\n\nThe board's fiscal plan, updated after Maria, assumes what some say is an overly rosy picture of how much money Puerto Rico will have to cover debt service and has made a deal with bondholders based on the assumptions.\n\nThe board\u2019s projection, which was lower before Hurricane Maria, takes into account the expected economic effect on Puerto Rico\u2019s economy of the investment of the federal restructuring and relief money, according to Hector Cordero-Guzm\u00e1n, a professor at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York system.\n\n\u201cYou take a dollar and use it to buy equipment and supplies and to hire personnel, that person has to pay payroll tax, that goes to the Puerto Rico treasury,\u201d Cordero-Guzman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not, take a dollar and give it to a bondholder.

In an affidavit, the bureau said it found a posting showing that Clark called the Pittsburgh attack \u201ca dry run for things to come.\u201d Clark, 30, was arrested on gun charges on Tuesday, and a federal complaint explored potential connections between Clark and Bowers on the social network Gab, where white supremacists have made a home in the last two years after being banned by more mainstream sites.\n\nBut according to an NBC News analysis of Clark\u2019s social media posts, the claim that Clark had insider knowledge of the shootings is incorrect. A look at Clark\u2019s posting history shows that he was referring to a different alleged terrorist \u2014 the man accused of sending pipe bombs to Trump critics \u2014 and that Clark posted the comment about a \u201cdry run\u201d before the Pittsburgh shooting took place.\n\nClark\u2019s profile has been removed from Gab. The archives of his posts were viewed by NBC News via pushshift.io, a social media analysis tool operated by data scientist Jason Baumgartner.\n\nThe claim of a connection between Clark and Bowers came in an affidavit in which FBI Special Agent Michael Bauknight wrote that Clark\u2019s account \u201cshows a picture of Robert Bowers, armed with a gun, splattered in what appears to be blood, followed by the following post by Clark: \u2018Nah he was BASED! Get used to it libtards. This was a dry run for things to come.\u2019\u201d (Based is a term of approval and praise among extremists on the far right.)\n\n\u201cThis statement implies that Jeffery Clark did know more about the attack in the Tree-of-Life synagogue, and that there was more to come,\u201d Bauknight wrote.\n\nBut Clark made the post referred to in the FBI affidavit on Oct. 26, a day before the Pittsburgh shooting, NBC News found. In the post, Clark was replying to another Gab user complaining about Cesar Sayoc, the Florida man who allegedly mailed pipe bombs to prominent Democrats. \u201cThis Sayoc guy is a f---ing idiot. How tiresome. We have to get saddled with this s--- and blamed for it? F---ing hell,\u201d user \u201cArthur Frayn\u201d wrote.\n\nClark replied by praising Sayoc as \"based\u201d and suggesting \"libtards\" get used to the violence.\n\nAnd the photo that the FBI claims Clark shared of Robert Bowers, splattered with blood, is actually an alt-right meme, which was posted on an article about the attempted pipe bombings on a popular neo-Nazi website one day before Clark\u2019s post, and two days before Bowers\u2019 shooting.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office\n\nIn the meme, a bearded man in a fisherman\u2019s hat is holding a gun. Along with splattered blood, the words, \u201cThey cut off our social security so we cut off their heads,\u201d covers the main image and a stamp reading \u201cBoomerwaffen Division\u201d is fixed to the bottom, a portmanteau of a term for older Americans and the Atomwaffen Division, a national socialist terrorist organization.\n\nNBC News found the image through a reverse image search on the Russian search engine Yandex of Clark\u2019s post, which was provided to NBC News by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office. During Clark\u2019s hearing Tuesday, prosecutors acknowledged they were looking into questions about the FBI\u2019s analysis of Clark\u2019s posts in the charging documents. Clark\u2019s lawyer, the FBI and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nClark was charged on Tuesday with transporting a firearm across state lines and possession of illegal, high-capacity magazines.\n\nHe was a prolific user of Gab, which briefly shut down in October after its web host and support services abandoned the site following reports that Bowers had posted anti-Semitic comments there before the shooting.\n\nClark and Bowers both followed each other on the site, according to an archive of Bowers\u2019 removed account, viewed by NBC News. They were among each other\u2019s hundreds of followers, but a review of their thousands of posts shows no actual conversation between the two.\n\nUnder the username @PureWhiteEvil, Clark posted over 3,700 times to Gab. Clark explained in August that he had moved to the site after multiple failed attempts to evade Twitter's ban on his neo-Nazi content. \"I used to be DC Stormer, DC Death Squad, then DC Bowl Patrol (which preceeded BOWL GANG) before giving up on being able to stay on Twitter after which I retired here.\"\n\nOn Gab, Clark idolized Dylann Roof, the man who shot and killed nine black people at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, and obsessed over \"cultural marxism\" and baseless conspiracies involving vast pedophelia rings. He also posted hate speech and threats, including over 60 calls to throw Jewish and black people, journalists and perceived political enemies \"feet first into a woodchipper.\"\n\nFollowing the Pittsburgh shootings, Clark posted defensively against outrage over the killings and railed against calls for Gab to self-censor users. Clark also praised Bowers in a Gab post after the shootings, where he wrote, \u201cf---ing k---- that got shot by the hero #RobertBowers were all active supporters of pedophilia\u2026 and every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse,\u201d according to the FBI\u2019s affidavit.\n\nThat post was not available via the archive accessed by NBC News and a representative from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to share a copy or say if they had one. Gab may have removed it before it could be captured by the archive.\n\nIn one of his final posts, Clark \"dared\" Gab CEO Andrew Torba to ban him. Torba \"can ban me if he wants but he knows as well as anyone else that banning me for this would take away any reason people still have to post here,\" Clark said.", "By Julie Compton\n\nSurrounded by the skyscrapers that tower over Times Square, a new billboard went up this week that in large black letters reads: \u201cNO GAYS ALLOWED.\u201d Just below, a smaller message states: \u201cSTOP Alliance Defending Freedom. Learn more at NoGays.org.\u201d\n\nThe billboard is part of a new campaign that aims to draw attention to the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, or ADF, which has been labeled an anti-LGBTQ \u201chate group\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a designation the group disputes. Since its founding nearly 25 years ago, ADF has been linked to efforts seeking to criminalize homosexuality, restrict transgender people\u2019s access to sex-segregated facilities and permit businesses to deny service to LGBTQ people.\n\nCaleb Cade, a spokesman for Citizens for Transparency, the advocacy group behind the campaign, said the powerful nonprofit law group has fought for years to undermine lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer rights, often behind the scenes.\n\n\u201cWe want to remind people that there are still really insidious forces at work against our community,\u201d Cade told NBC News. \u201cADF has been leading that war for a long time, with tens of millions of dollars to do it.\u201d\n\nThe Times Square billboard, which went up Tuesday and is expected to remain through February, directs viewers to the campaign\u2019s website, which provides information about ADF\u2019s past works and links to news articles about its efforts to \u201cmake LGBT people second-class citizens.\u201d\n\nIn response to the newly launched campaign, ADF\u2019s senior counsel, Jeremy Tedesco, shot back at Citizens for Transparency, calling it \u201can anonymous group that simply copies and pastes false claims\" of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\u201cADF is one the nation\u2019s most respected and successful Supreme Court advocates, working to preserve our fundamental freedoms of speech, religion and conscience,\u201d Tedesco wrote in an email to NBC News. \u201cADF is not litigating any cases, pursuing any legislation, nor supporting the passage of any laws domestically or internationally that criminalize sodomy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRELENTLESSLY EXTREME\u201d\n\nADF was founded in 1994 by a group of influential Christian leaders, including Alan Sears, co-author of the 2003 book \"The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Freedom Today,\u201d and James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family and author of the 2004 book \u201cMarriage Under Fire,\u201d which claimed same-sex marriage would \u201cdestroy the fundamental principles of marriage, parenthood and gender.\u201d\n\nHeidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, said her organization first became aware of ADF in 2013, when it discovered the nonprofit was advising anti-LGBTQ organizations overseas \u2014 in places including Belize and Jamaica \u2014 on how to keep anti-sodomy laws on their books.\n\n\"If there\u2019s an outrageous and ill-founded lawsuit happening against trans people, it\u2019s usually the ADF.\"\n\nTheir efforts to criminalize same-sex sexual activity, however, go back much further than 2013. In the landmark Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down the remaining anti-sodomy laws in the U.S., ADF (then known as the Alliance Defense Fund) submitted a friend of the court brief in support of keeping the laws on the books.\n\n\u201cThere is no fundamental right \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and traditions\u2019 to engage in same-sex sodomy,\u201d the brief concluded.\n\nADF also contributed to friend of the court briefs against expanding gay rights in other landmark Supreme Court cases, including same-sex marriage cases Obergefell v. Hodges and United States v. Windsor.\n\n\u201cThe majority of their work lately,\u201d according to Beirich, \u201chas revolved around religious freedom cases to basically allow certain businesses not to have to serve the LGBTQ population.\u201d\n\nIn one of its most recent and high-profile cases, ADF successfully argued a Supreme Court case on behalf of Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips, the Colorado baker who refused to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding because he said it would violate his religious beliefs.\n\nIn a case filed last week, ADF is representing a professor who is suing officials at his small public university in Ohio after receiving a warning for violating its nondiscrimination policy by not addressing a transgender student by her preferred gender terms.\n\nIn what could be another high-profile case, ADF is urging the Supreme Court to consider a case out of Michigan in which a funeral home fired a transgender employee due to the owner\u2019s religious beliefs. The 6th U.S. Circuit of Appeals sided with the worker, ruling that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects transgender workers. The funeral home appealed.\n\nMara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, called ADF \u201cthe most relentlessly extreme anti-trans law group.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an outrageous and ill-founded lawsuit happening against trans people, it\u2019s usually the ADF,\u201d Keisling told NBC News.\n\nIn addition to its work in the courts, ADF has also been linked to so-called transgender bathroom bills that have been introduced in recent years in state legislatures across the U.S. aimed at restricting trans people\u2019s access to sex-segregated facilities.\n\nAccording to an in-depth NBC News report published in April 2017, many of these \u201cbathroom bills\u201d filed across multiple states resemble one another \u2014 and that\u2019s because they used language strongly similar to the model legislation called the Student Physical Privacy Act, which was drafted by ADF.\n\nADF operates on a budget of over $50 million, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ rights group. Like any 501c3 nonprofit, ADF is not required to disclose its donors, and many of its 3,200 allied attorneys do not publicize the pro bono work they do on behalf of the organization, which makes the group\u2019s efforts difficult to track, according to Beirich.\n\nFRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES\n\nDespite what many would consider its \u201cextreme\u201d views, ADF has not been relegated to the margins. In fact, Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, spoke at an ADF event this summer.\n\nDuring the speech, he thanked the group \u201con behalf of the president\u201d for its \u201cwork and commitment to religious freedom.\u201d He also defended the organization against the Souther Poverty Law Center\u2019s \u201chate group\u201d label.\n\n\u201cYou and I may not agree on everything \u2014 but I wanted to come back here tonight partly because I wanted to say this: You are not a hate group.\u201d\n\nBeirich said many people don\u2019t realize the influence the ADF wields. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t understand that this is the legal arm of the social conservative movement,\u201d she explained.\n\nCITIZENS FOR TRANSPARENCY\n\nWhile the No Gays Allowed campaign is dedicated to shining a spotlight on ADF, details about Citizens for Transparency itself is not very transparent. The group does not have a website, and when asked about the people behind it, Cade, its spokesman, simply described them as \u201ca group of concerned queer folks that want to fight back against ADF and what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nCade said the organization is a \u201c501c3 operating under a fiscal agent\u201d and added that the billboard was paid for with $90,000 raised from individual donations.\n\nA statement released about the campaign lists a number of prominent LGBTQ activists that Cade described as \u201callies\u201d of No Gays Allowed. They include Evan Wolfson, founder of Freedom to Marry; Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights; Eliza Byard, executive director of GLSEN (formerly the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network); and Christine Quinn, the former speaker of the New York City Council.\n\nQuinn, an out lesbian, told NBC News she hopes the billboard and broader campaign will spur awareness around ADF\u2019s efforts to curtail LGBTQ rights and the challenges the community still faces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to lead people to ask questions,\u201d Quinn said of the campaign. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really important, to start a conversation, and to have that conversation be in response to this billboard, not the messaging of the ADF.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Claire Atkinson\n\nThe head of Liberty Media, one of the biggest long-term investors in the media business, has sounded the alarm about Silicon Valley money that has flooded the entertainment industry \u2014 and warned that even Netflix could eventually be subsumed by the likes of Google, Amazon and Apple.\n\n\"No traditional media player would find it possible to play on these terms,\" said Greg Maffei, CEO of Liberty Media, speaking at the company's investor meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe comments reflect growing concern from traditional media companies about looming threats from tech giants that have been slowly entering into the realm of content production without necessarily needing to make much money off it.\n\n\"The people who are paying don't need to have it pay for itself,\" said Maffei, who suggested that Apple could afford $20 million for a 30 minute \"Carpool Karaoke\" episode by selling a few more devices.\n\nAmazon could justify a \"mind blowing content budget,\" Maffei said, thanks to its 100 million Prime subscribers.\n\nMaffei, a former chief financial officer of Microsoft, now oversees a company that is in the midst of digital shifts in a variety of entertainment businesses. Liberty Media has stakes in music, sports and entertainment companies, and its assets include music streaming company Pandora, satellite radio company SiriusXM, ticketing company Live Nation, Formula One racing and the Atlanta Braves. It also owns stakes in Viacom, food-focused digital media company Tastemade and AT&T, as well as a position in iHeart Radio's debt.\n\nMaffei was joined by John Malone, the Liberty Media Chairman who is considered the architect of the modern cable industry. Malone personally holds stakes in companies including as Discovery Communications, Lionsgate and Starz.\n\nMalone said that as tech companies crowded out traditional media players, others companies could find opportunities in being purely content suppliers.\n\n\"Not everybody is going to be able to do a global direct-to-consumer platform, so many will be trying to move into that space as a supplier, in some cases branded and in other cases as part of the food chain.\"\n\nMaffei also noted that money from tech companies had not just meant pricier productions \u2014 it also meant more content and places to consume it, highlighting in a slideshow presentation that online content has grown 680 percent since 2012, while the number of over-the-top services has shot up to around 200.\n\nJust about every major media company either has or is working on its own streaming subscription service, with a wide variety of smaller niche offerings catering to particular consumers tastes.\n\nMaffei said he did not expect them all to survive.\n\n\"I have a full expectation that we will see an RIP for video platforms,\" he said ominously, when drawing a comparison to streaming music startups that were winnowed in recent years to a few players.\n\nMaffei said that most people will pay just $38 per month for streaming services, which he said would be fine for deep-pocketed tech companies but could be a problem for the current pay-TV ecosystem that relies on consumers paying in excess of $100 per month in long-term contracts. Maffei also noted that piracy and discounting is rampant in the streaming world.\n\nMaffei praised Netflix for becoming the \"king\" but questioned how long its run of success could continue.\n\n\"What does winning look like?\" Maffei said. \"You have to ask a few questions. They're going to burn $3 billion of free cash flow this year,\" adding that the company had just raised $2 billion in debt to fund content \u2014 its third debt raise this year.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most common medical emergencies \u2013 an inflamed or ruptured appendix. It usually ends with a trip to the operating room and the removal of the organ.\n\nBut some patients can do just fine with infusions of antibiotics, and more doctors have considered non-surgical treatment of what\u2019s called uncomplicated appendicitis: an inflammation of the appendix that\u2019s not immediately life-threatening. The thinking has been that it must be safer and cheaper if the skin isn\u2019t cut open and a piece of the body removed.\n\nA new study out Wednesday contradicts this idea. People who got antibiotics instead of surgery did not fare better, and they ended up racking up higher medical bills. They were twice as likely to have to come back with a flare-up, a team at Stanford University found.\n\n\u201cPeople treated with antibiotics alone have a higher chance of coming back needing further treatment for appendicitis-related problems, such as abdominal abscesses,\u201d said Dr. Lindsay Sceats, who led the study team.\n\nSceats and colleagues studied the issue because patients often prefer skipping the scalpel if they can. \u201cMore and more patients in the Stanford emergency room have been asking about whether they can just take antibiotics when they come in with appendicitis instead of having surgery,\u201d Sceats, a surgeon at Stanford Hospital, said in a statement.\n\nThey looked at the medical records of more than 58,000 people with uncomplicated appendicitis. Most had their appendix removed, but just under 5 percent of them, about 2,600, opted for infusions of antibiotics instead.\n\nMost patients in both groups did fine but those who got antibiotics alone were twice as likely to have to come back and 42 percent more likely to develop an abscess, the team reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association\u2019s JAMA Surgery.\n\nMost of the patients treated with antibiotics alone were cured. Only 4 percent needed appendectomies later, the researchers found. But their risk of a new flare-up of appendicitis lasted for as long as four years, the team found.\n\n\u201cEven if the initial hospitalization is cheaper, when you look at long-term cost, which our study did, it ends up being more expensive,\u201d Sceats said.\n\nAppendectomies are very common. An estimated 5 percent of the U.S. population will suffer acute appendicitis at some time in their lives.\n\n\u201cDue to sheer volume, appendectomy is the sixth leading cause of morbidity and mortality owing to emergency general surgery in the United States,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nAn inflamed appendix can rupture and cause gangrene. \u201cAs such, urgent appendectomy has historically been considered the mainstay of treatment,\u201d the researchers wrote. Any kind of surgery can cause problems and appendectomies are no exception. Up to 23 percent of patients have some sort of postoperative complication.\n\nBut using antibiotics alone did not reduce the rate of problems.\n\n\u201cPeople treated with antibiotics are more likely to come back and be hospitalized for any sort of belly pain,\u201d Sceats said. \u201cDoctors may also be more cautious when the appendix isn\u2019t removed.\u201d That may mean patients get hospitalized fast, just in case it is a new flare-up of appendicitis.\n\n\u201cThese results tell us that, in most cases, surgery is still the best strategy,\u201d Sceats said. \u201cFor your average, healthy 30-year-old, the alternative treatment is no cheaper, and it\u2019s easier to have the surgery. You also no longer have an appendix, so you\u2019re no longer at risk of having appendicitis again.\u201d\n\nThe appendix is a small pouch found near where the large and small intestines meet. For decades it was considered to be of no use at all, but doctors now believe it\u2019s important to the immune system and may serve as a reservoir for \u201cgood\u201d bacteria.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy David Ingram\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ever since Facebook disclosed last year that Russian operatives had covertly run a disinformation campaign on its network, tech companies have pledged to work together to root out examples of government-sponsored information warfare.\n\nIn one episode this summer, it didn\u2019t work that way.\n\nFacebook and Google disclosed in August that they had spent two months investigating a network of accounts they found were tied to Iranian state media. The companies took down the accounts, pages and groups, which numbered in the hundreds and pushed divisive political messages in the U.S., Britain and elsewhere.\n\nOther tech companies were behind on the news. On services including Twitter, Reddit and Pinterest, researchers found posts similar to what Facebook and Google reported, but those companies didn\u2019t have the luxury of a two-month head start.\n\nThe difference, according to interviews with people at those companies and in the industry, was that Facebook and Google were clients of a cybersecurity company named FireEye, which found some of the accounts and tipped them off.\n\nThe divide between threat-intelligence haves and have-nots has caused some grumbling in Silicon Valley. An executive at one tech company said it was \u201cfrustrating\u201d not to receive a warning about a significant threat when FireEye, Facebook and Google knew about it for months. The executive, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize professional relationships, said it would be better if companies collaborated.\n\nThe episode illustrates how little-known security firms originally built to detect computer viruses and respond to hacking attempts are now taking on a growing role in the hunt for disinformation on social media at a time when tech companies are trying to work together to address foreign influence campaigns.\n\nHaves and have nots\n\nFireEye is just one of many threat intelligence firms offering similar services, making it a challenge for tech companies that may not want to pay a variety of companies to keep on the lookout for disinformation campaigns.\n\nThe annual cost of threat intelligence services generally varies from $50,000 to $250,000, according to the research firm Forrester. Sometimes it is sold as a supplement to other services, and some clients have special projects that can push the cost higher, Josh Zelonis, Forrester senior analyst, said.\n\nCompanies generally try to avoid overlap in security vendors, so if they\u2019ve already hired one that does research into, for example, threats on the internet\u2019s dark web, they are unlikely to hire another with seemingly similar capabilities.\n\n\u201cAny organization is generally going to prefer a single-vendor solution,\u201d Zelonis said.\n\nA FireEye information analyst works in front of a screen showing a near real-time map tracking cyber threats at the FireEye office in Milpitas, California, in 2014. Beck Diefenbach / Reuters file\n\nFireEye, which is based in the San Francisco Bay Area and employs around 3,000 people, declined to disclose how much it charges for its threat-intelligence services, but said it is aware of the frustrations of non-clients.\n\nSandra Joyce, FireEye\u2019s vice president for global intelligence operations, said that the company was testing a new product for smaller clients to buy \u201cexpertise on demand,\u201d a potentially more affordable option for companies that do not have the security budget of Facebook or Google.\n\nToo big to surveil\n\nTech companies like Facebook and Google are relying on FireEye and other vendors in part because they grew so quickly over the past decade that they did not anticipate how people might misuse their services \u2014 or they did not act on warnings. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Congress in April that the company hadn\u2019t taken \u201ca broad enough view of our responsibility.\u201d\n\nSiva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, said that companies like FireEye have an advantage because they focus on hiring people with language and cultural expertise in contrast to Silicon Valley\u2019s approach of trying to solve problems with large-scale software.\n\nThe headquarters of FireEye in Milpitas, California. Kris Tripplaar / Sipa USA\n\n\u201cThey seem to be two steps ahead of Facebook,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d think that Facebook, one of the highest capitalized companies in the world, would have enough people in-house imagining all the worst scenarios, but Facebook has a habit of outsourcing some of its most important work.\u201d\n\nFacebook said in a blog post that it has contracts with \u201cvarious\u201d cybersecurity research firms and academic institutions. \u201cWe\u2019ll often turn to these groups when we suspect a threat from a certain actor or region,\u201d the social network said. \u201cAt other times, these groups identify suspicious activity on their own, without guidance from us.\u201d\n\nFireEye said it has an advantage because it can see threats across industries, not just against one company, and its analysts speak more than 30 languages.\n\nThe company does make some threat intelligence public. After tech firms beginning with Facebook disclosed their takedowns of accounts they linked to Iran, FireEye posted a 38-page report on its website, detailing its work.\n\n\u201cWhen we put something out publicly like this, it\u2019s certainly to warn and equip the security community, but also the public,\u201d Joyce said.\n\nIn the spotlight\n\nFacebook and Google, in their public statements about the takedowns, shared credit with FireEye, fueling a publicity bonanza for the firm. Joyce said FireEye had \u201cdefinitely seen a pick-up\u201d in its intelligence business since August, though she declined to say by how much. FireEye isn\u2019t profitable due to slowing growth in other services it offers. It reported a net loss of $304 million last year.\n\nFireEye said its employees have drawn on experience looking into \u201chacktivists\u201d \u2014 ideologically driven hackers such as the group Anonymous whose tactics, the company said, foreshadowed what Russians did in the United States during the 2016 presidential election when they disseminated stolen emails through online personas such as DC Leaks.\n\nBesides Facebook and Google, FireEye serves an array of clients with services often unrelated to information warfare, such as investigating breaches. The Defense Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are clients. Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2014 that the CIA had been a client, and one of FireEye\u2019s early investors was In-Q-Tel, an investment firm whose partners include the CIA and other intelligence agencies.\n\nFireEye\u2019s work on the broader rise of private intelligence services have caused concern among some privacy advocates, who say these companies could turn their methods on domestic American subjects, quelling dissent on behalf of powerful clients while escaping strict oversight.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no accountability there, except to the company and its shareholders,\u201d said Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nFireEye said its focus is the subterfuge carried out by governments, not local protests.\n\n\u201cWe specialize in identifying inauthentic accounts and online behavior, tied to nation-states, that is intended to surreptitiously manipulate target audiences for geopolitical purposes,\u201d the company said in a statement.", "Get the Mach newsletter.\n\nBy Mike Wall, Space.com\n\nThe nearest single star to the sun apparently hosts a big, icy planet.\n\nAstronomers have found strong evidence of a frigid alien world about 3.2 times more massive than Earth circling Barnard's Star, a dim red dwarf that lies just 6 light-years from the sun.

[Gallery: The Strangest Alien Planets]\n\nThis unparalleled apparent motion is a consequence of the proximity of Barnard's Star and its high (but not record-setting) velocity of 310,000 mph (500,000 km/h) relative to the sun.\n\nAnd Barnard's Star is getting closer to us every day: In about 10,000 years, the red dwarf will take over the nearest-star mantle from the Alpha Centauri system. At that time, just 3.8 light-years will separate Barnard's Star from the sun.\n\nBarnard's Star is about twice as old as Earth's sun, one-sixth as massive and just 3 percent as luminous. Because Barnard's Star is so dim, its \"habitable zone\" \u2014 the range of distances where liquid water may be possible on a world's surface \u2014 lies extremely close-in. Indeed, researchers estimate that zone to be a sliver that lies 0.06 AU to 0.10 AU from the star. (One AU, or astronomical unit, is the Earth-sun distance \u2014 about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers.)\n\nThe habitable-zone concept is a tricky one, of course. Gauging a world's true habitability requires a strong working knowledge of its atmospheric composition and thickness, among other characteristics. And such information is hard to come by for exoplanets.\n\nA long search\n\nBarnard's Star has long been a target of exoplanet hunters, but their searches have always come up empty \u2014 until now.\n\nAnd the new detection wasn't easy: Ribas and his team analyzed huge amounts of data, both archival and newly gathered, before finally digging up Barnard's Star b.\n\nThey used the \"radial velocity\" method, which looks for changes in starlight caused by the gravitational tug of an orbiting planet. Such tugs cause a star to wobble slightly, shifting its light toward red wavelengths at times and toward the blue end of the spectrum at others, as seen from Earth. [7 Ways to Discovery Alien Planets]\n\n\"We used observations from seven different instruments, spanning 20 years of measurements, making this one of the largest and most extensive datasets ever used for precise radial-velocity studies,\" Ribas said in the same statement. \"The combination of all data led to a total of 771 measurements \u2014 a huge amount of information!\"\n\nNever before had the radial velocity method been used to find such a small planet in such a distant orbit, study team members said. (Big, close-in planets tug their host stars more powerfully and therefore cause more dramatic, and more easily detectable, light shifts.)\n\nThose seven instruments were the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), at the European Southern Observatory's (ESO) La Silla Observatory in Chile; the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope, at ESO's Paranal Observatory in Chile; HARPS-North, at the Galileo National Telescope in the Canary Islands; the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer, at the Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii; the Carnegie Institute's Planet Finder Spectrograph, at the Magellan 6.5-m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile; the Automated Planet Finder at the 2.4-m telescope at the University of California's Lick Observatory; and& CARMENES, at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.\n\nThe researchers also detected hints of another possible planet in the system, orbiting farther out than Barnard's Star b \u2014 way farther out, with an orbital period of 6,600 Earth days. But this second signal is too weak to be deemed a planet candidate, Teske said.\n\n\"There's not enough data,\" she told Space.com.\n\nA frigid super-Earth\n\nBarnard's Star b is at least 3.2 times more massive than our own planet, making it a \"super-Earth\" \u2014 the class of worlds that are significantly larger than Earth but smaller than \"ice giants\" such as Neptune and Uranus.\n\nThe newfound planet candidate lies 0.4 AU from its host star and completes one orbit every 233 Earth days, according to the new study.\n\nThis orbital distance is similar to that of radiation-blasted Mercury in our own solar system. But, because Barnard's Star is so dim, the potential planet lies right around the system's \"snow line\" \u2014 the region where volatile materials such as water can condense into solid ices.\n\n\"Until now, only giant planets had been detected at such a distance from their stars,\" Rodrigo Diaz, of the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics at the National Council of Scientific and Technical Research and the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, said in an accompanying \"News and Views\" article that was also published today in Nature.\n\n\"The authors' discovery of a low-mass planet near the snow line places strong constraints on formation models for this type of planet,\" added Diaz, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nBarnard's Star b, if it does indeed exist, is not a very promising abode for life as we know it, at least not on the surface. The potential planet is likely very cold, with an estimated surface temperature of about minus 275 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 170 degrees Fahrenheit), study team members said.\n\nConfirmation of Barnard's Star b is unlikely to come from additional radial-velocity measurements, Diaz wrote. But super-precise measurements of star positions, such as those now being made by the European Space Agency's Gaia spacecraft, may do the job in the next few years, he added.\n\n\"Even more excitingly, the next generation of ground-based instrumentation, also coming into operation in the 2020s, should be able to directly image the reported planet, and measure its light spectrum,\" Diaz wrote.\n\n\"Using this spectrum, the characteristics of the planet\u2019s atmosphere \u2014 such as its winds and rotation rate \u2014 could be inferred,\" he added. \"This remarkable planet therefore gives us a key piece in the puzzle of planetary formation and evolution, and might be among the first low-mass exoplanets whose atmospheres are probed in detail.\"\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT EXOPLANETS?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "By Agnes Constante\n\nThe dean of the Berkeley School of Law on Tuesday said he would recommend de-naming a wing of the school's building that honors a lawyer who held anti-Chinese views.\n\nThe wing, known as Boalt Hall, was named after John Boalt, a Nevada lawyer whose wife, Elizabeth Josselyn Boalt, donated $100,000 to build Boalt Memorial Hall of Law in 1911.\n\nWhile Boalt Hall refers to a wing of the building, the law school, part of the University of California, was often referred to by that name, and some alumni call themselves \u201cBoalties.\u201d\n\nKnowledge of Boalt's views became more widely known after The San Francisco Chronicle last year published an opinion article by Charles Reichmann, an attorney and lecturer at Berkeley Law, who argued that that wing of the building should be renamed because of Boalt's anti-Chinese racism.\n\nReichmann, who also wrote about the issue in an article published in the Asian American Law Journal published at Berkeley Law, noted that Boalt advocated for the end of Chinese immigration, referring to a paper Boalt read at the Berkeley Club in 1877 titled \u201cThe Chinese Question,\u201d which was influential in building support in California for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.\n\nIn response to Boalt's views being brought to light, Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky created a committee to research the issue in September 2017. The committee received comments from more than 2,000 individuals \u2014 nearly half in favor of eliminating the use of the name Boalt \u2014 and held a town hall earlier this year before issuing recommendations that Chemerinsky released in September.\n\nChemerinsky received more than 600 messages in response to the committee's report, he noted in a public letter on the school\u2019s website. About 60 percent were in favor of dropping the name.\n\nIn the public letter, Chemerinsky wrote that he changed his mind on the issue several times.\n\n\u201cI find this a very difficult question,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am reassured, though, that ultimately this is about a symbol, not the substance of the law school. Berkeley Law is a terrific, very special place whether we officially use the name Boalt or not.\u201d\n\nChemerinsky also encouraged organizations within the law school to stop using the name. Lecturer positions named for the Boalts will also be renamed after recent deans.\n\nThe law school will next submit a formal request to de-name Boalt Hall. The decision to drop the name is ultimately up to UC Berkeley's chancellor.\n\nCharles Cannon, senior assistant dean and chief administrative officer at Berkeley Law, said he expects it would take until summer 2019 before the chancellor makes a decision.\n\nReichmann in an email said he was happy with Chemerinsky's decision.\n\n\u201cWhen racism or other objectionable behavior is discovered in a namesake, it is necessary to weigh and evaluate the entirety of the namesake's career,\u201d he said. \u201cJohn Boalt's greatest public 'accomplishment' was to promote the exclusion of Chinese people from the United States, and he didn't attend or teach at the law school that bears his name.

They\u2019re opening up on 44th Road. My barber shop is on 44th Road,\u201d said Shawn Dixon, the owner of Otis & Finn, which has been in the neighborhood for the past four years. \u201cThe rent goes up, and it\u2019s only going to get worse.\u201d\n\nDixon held a sign that read, \u201cWelcome Amazon! But first: Fund schools and infrastructure, pass small business protections, local businesses on the Amazon campus. Or stay the helipad out!\u201d\n\nThe warning is a reference to the helipad Amazon allegedly asked for \u2014 in addition to the $1.7 billion in performance-based tax incentives the retail giant procured from the state of New York. Amazon has also said it will apply for a subsidy program that would give property tax abatements for up to 25 years, along with other tax incentive programs for which it may be eligible.\n\nProtesters gathered Wednesday in Gordan Triangle near Amazon\u2019s future headquarters listened to local politicians who said they weren\u2019t given a seat at the table during negotiations and demanded transparency and a say before Amazon breaks ground in Long Island City.\n\n\u201cWhy can Google bring 20,000 jobs here without any public subsidies but Amazon needs $3 billion?\u201d asked state Senator Mike Gianaris. \u201cWhat is so special about Amazon?\u201d\n\nCongresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district is in Queens, was at freshman orientation in Washington but sent a representative to the protest, who said Ocasio-Cortez opposes the current Amazon deal.\n\nFor more than an hour, several local politicians and community activists spoke to a crowd holding signs and offering a chorus of boos every time the helipad and billions of dollars were mentioned.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even have heat and hot water in Queensbridge!\u201d one protester shouted.

In one of Hartford\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, a three-month investigation by NBC News found that HUD failed to comply with federal laws requiring prompt action against the owner of a property that authorities knew was unsafe, unhealthy and in disrepair, according to documents released through the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\u201cWe can't say that it's acceptable, just because somebody's poor, that their kid lays in bed at night with mice,\u201d said Cori Mackey, executive director of the Christian Activities Council, a social justice group in Hartford that has helped the Infill tenants organize. \u201cEverything that's being done is a Band-Aid.\u201d\n\nHUD says that it is making an aggressive effort to go after delinquent landlords. \u201cThe department is under new marching orders from Secretary Carson to redouble our enforcement against those who violate our rules,\u201d said HUD spokesman Jereon Brown.\n\nAshley Matos doesn't allow her children to enter the basement of their apartment because of a mold infestation. Hannah Rappleye / NBC News\n\nBut tenants here say they feel trapped in decrepit homes with nowhere else to go. Their rental assistance is tied to the property, so they can\u2019t take their subsidy elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI have no control over it, and talking about it to the people in charge \u2014 it's useless,\u201d said Erica Pierre, 31, a single mother whose Infill apartment is infested with mold and rodents. \u201cIf I could leave, I would.\u201d\n\n\u2018We need these landlords\u2019\n\nThe Infill buildings are scattered across Hartford\u2019s North End, a predominantly black neighborhood where nearly half of the residents live below the poverty line.\n\nUnder the Obama administration, HUD singled out the neighborhood for federal help, citing the North End\u2019s \u201calarmingly high rates of unemployment, violent crime and food insecurity\u201d in 2015. Low-slung houses, corner stores and abandoned lots still surround the Infill apartments, where residents live in two-story units covered in brick and white siding.\n\nOn paper, they are the kind of privately owned, publicly subsidized properties that Carson has championed as the solution to the country\u2019s affordable housing crisis. Under the Section 8 affordable housing program, tenants typically pay 30 percent of their income toward rent, and taxpayers make up the rest. Infill\u2019s landlord is guaranteed over $700,000 in rent for the entire property each year, according to documents released through the Freedom of Information Act and obtained by NBC News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the private-public partnerships that work because there\u2019s almost unlimited money in the private sector,\" Carson said in April 2017, shortly after becoming HUD secretary. \"There\u2019s very limited money in the government.\u201d\n\nBut relying on private landlords still requires HUD resources and staff to ensure owners are delivering what they promised to taxpayers. And HUD officials have acknowledged that even when these buildings fail physical inspections, HUD is slow to cancel contracts or impose fines on delinquent landlords \u2014 reluctant to force tenants out of their homes and fearing that landlords will pull out of the Section 8 program altogether. Instead, HUD generally tries to accommodate landlords who promise to make fixes, even if they are slow in coming.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t pull levers to send shockwaves into the landlord communities. We need housing \u2014 we need the units out there,\u201d said a HUD official, who asked not to be identified to speak frankly about the department. \u201cWe need these landlords.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Infill, though, HUD acknowledged that the landlord failed to deliver. \u201cThe owner provided certain assurances to our field folks that, in the end, did not happen,\u201d Sullivan said in an email. That hasn't stopped the federal subsidies. \"It's a flow of money that continues to come,\" said AJ Johnson, a local pastor who has helped the tenants organize.\n\nLong delays, little action\n\nLiving conditions at the Infill apartments deteriorated after new owner Blima Isaacson and manager Eli Fish took over the HUD-subsidized buildings in the summer of 2016, more than a dozen tenants told NBC News.\n\nErica Pierre's 9-year-old daughter has asthma that is triggered by mold and mice. Hannah Rappleye / NBC News\n\nPierre, who works full-time for Hartford\u2019s education department, said she tries hard to make a home for herself and her 9-year-old daughter, filling the space with family photographs and houseplants. Upstairs, her daughter\u2019s room is decorated in pink and purple, matching her favorite toy \u2014 a Barbie dream house. But, Pierre said, she feels powerless against the mold that grows in the basement and across the ceiling of her bathroom.\n\nThe previous landlord had kept the mold at bay by spraying the walls with bleach, Pierre said. That\u2019s what her daughter\u2019s medical provider had recommended after determining that the girl's asthma was triggered by mold and mice, medical records show.\n\nBut Fish, the new property manager, has neglected the problem, Pierre said. \u201cThere's been times when I've done a half day at work and waited for him to come,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one showed up.\u201d\n\nThe property dropped from 91 points in a November 2014 inspection to 27 points this year, according to HUD records. This should have set off a tight timeline of responses under legislation Congress passed in 2017 and renewed in March, prompted by grim conditions in other Section 8 buildings.\n\nInstead, HUD and the landlord missed one deadline after another. HUD began the process by issuing a failed inspection report to Infill\u2019s owner on Feb. 2, according to records released through the Freedom of Information Act and obtained by NBC News. HUD was then required to follow up within 15 days to notify Infill\u2019s landlord that he was in default of the contract and give him a deadline for correcting all problems. But HUD didn\u2019t issue that notice until early May \u2014 96 days later.\n\nWhen it finally sent the notice, which was addressed to Fish, HUD informed him that he had 60 days to \u201ccorrect all physical deficiencies\u201d at Infill, or else face further action by HUD. But Fish took more than twice as long \u2014 131 days \u2014 to certify that he had fixed all problems, according to HUD documents obtained by NBC News.\n\nHUD says Infill\u2019s owner moved more quickly to fix exposed wires, missing smoke detectors and other serious violations, according to a HUD visit in mid-February. But in June, July and August, city inspectors found rampant infestations of bed bugs and mice, according to inspection reports obtained by NBC News that detailed dozens of violations. The city also cited Infill for missing smoke detectors and electrical hazards \u2014 the types of urgent safety violations that HUD claimed had been fixed months earlier.\n\nFish finally told HUD the buildings had been fully repaired in mid-September, which should have prompted HUD to follow up with a top-to-bottom inspection \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d according to the department\u2019s latest guidance. But HUD only came in to re-inspect the Infill apartments after weeks of questioning by NBC News. The department declined to release the new inspection score or report from its Nov. 6 visit and told NBC News to file a Freedom of Information Act request. (HUD said the score was not final and the department needed to give the owner time to appeal if he chose to do so.)\n\nHUD characterized the delays as typical. But they fly in the face of legislation that Congress passed to speed up and toughen HUD\u2019s response to failing properties \u2014 changes that HUD has inserted in its official guidance. The worst cases are handled by HUD\u2019s Departmental Enforcement Center, which can use everything from monetary penalties to the replacement of property managers to get delinquent landlords in line.\n\nWhen pressed to explain the protracted delays, HUD said that cases like Infill\u2019s can often take more time, not less. \u201cAs always, when the DEC becomes involved, more time is needed to determine an enforcement approach,\u201d said Sullivan, the HUD spokesman, referring to the Departmental Enforcement Center.\n\nIn the meantime, tenants say they\u2019ve been left with damaged windows, vermin, mold and faulty heat. One tenant said she had been complaining about a leaky kitchen ceiling \u201cfor months\u201d to Fish before it collapsed completely in July, terrifying her family. The landlord finally patched up the hole. But water continues to leak throughout the Infill properties, tenants say.\n\nDuring a recent downpour, Ashley Matos rushed into her son's bedroom to mop up the water that had leaked in through his window. She called the landlord but says it took weeks to get a response. \"We have to go chase him,\" Matos said.\n\nAt another Section 8 property in Hartford, Fish repeatedly failed to comply with HUD requests to clean up a building where a child under the age of 6 had tested positive for lead poisoning under a previous owner, according to documents obtained by NBC News.\n\nWhen approached by NBC News at one of his Infill buildings, Fish waved off questions and drove away in his car. Isaacson, who shares a Brooklyn home address with Fish according to public records, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u2018We just don\u2019t have the staff\u2019\n\nHUD officials have admitted that they don\u2019t have the resources to keep close tabs on the tens of thousands of subsidized properties they oversee.\n\nIn Hartford, just up the street from Infill, a Section 8 property run by another landlord passed inspection in February despite holes in the ceiling, rampant mold and other serious problems. Meeting privately with irate tenants in early October, HUD officials blamed an inspection process that can result in inflated scores from contract inspectors, despite recent reforms.\n\n\u201cThat's how you get a passing score with mold, vermin and a falling down bathroom ceiling \u2014 the system is broken,\u201d said one HUD official in a recording of the meeting with tenants provided to NBC News on the condition that the participants not be identified. (HUD verified that the recording was authentic.)\n\nWhen tenants asked at the meeting why HUD hadn\u2019t followed up sooner, the HUD official said the department didn\u2019t have the capacity. \u201cWe just don't have the staff for it,\u201d he said, according to the recording. \u201cThere are 432 properties in Connecticut alone and I have \u2014 I have five staff,\u201d his colleague added.\n\nSarah Wheeler cries in the living room of her home in Hartford's Infill buildings. Wheeler says both her landlord and the federal government have ignored her pleas for help in fixing the conditions in her family's apartment. \"We're tired of having to make phone calls,\" Wheeler said. \"We're tired of people coming out, like HUD and the city, and nothing is still getting done. Nothing.\" Hannah Rappleye / NBC News\n\nInstead, HUD says that it relies on the vigilance of outside advocates like Cori Mackey and AJ Johnson of the Christian Activities Council, as well as organized tenants and media reports to prompt action on properties that have fallen through the cracks. That\u2019s what led HUD to take the rare step of canceling its contract with another Hartford landlord, Emmanuel Ku, in May, for repeatedly failing to repair his Section 8 apartments. (Ku did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\u201cWhen something is brought to our attention through Cori or you all, we can say, \u2018Wait a minute, we need to take a look,\u2019\u201d the first HUD official told Hartford tenants, according to the recording.\n\nHUD\u2019s staffing shortfalls extend well beyond Connecticut. HUD has shed more than 480 staff members since the end of the Obama administration, according to government records, in part due to the hiring freeze Trump implemented when he took office.\n\nThe department\u2019s enforcement office has been losing staff for years, but it\u2019s reached a two-decade low of 90 employees under Carson, according to data provided to NBC News by the Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe watchdog also found that work completed by HUD's enforcement office dropped by 25 percent since 2016 and criticized HUD for failing to keep track of its caseload. When asked for enforcement data that HUD is required by law to provide to Congress \u2014 totaling the actions taken on failing properties \u2014 HUD said it could not provide reports before November 2017 because it had never compiled them.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s indifference or incompetence, the Trump administration\u2019s failures in Connecticut and around the country cannot be excused. Someone must be held accountable,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who led previous efforts to strengthen the HUD inspection process. \u201cSecretary Carson owes it to these families to present a concrete plan for how he will make this better, and how he\u2019ll make sure nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in HUD\u2019s regional offices \u2014 which are on the front lines of monitoring troubled properties \u2014 current and recently departed officials say that they have struggled to fill positions and that caseloads have spiked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge vacancy problem,\u201d said Ellen Lurie Hoffman, federal policy director at the National Housing Trust, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \u201cWe know from hearing from them that many of the field offices are overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nHUD admits that \u201cwe are leaner than we used to be\u201d but Sullivan, the spokesman, said the department is in the process of bringing on 77 staff members to the Office of Multifamily Housing, which oversees the contracts for multifamily rentals, and is recruiting for 48 vacant positions. The department added that it is conducting a \u201cwholesale re-examination\u201d of the inspection process and recently released new guidance meant to strengthen its oversight of HUD-subsidized apartments.\n\nBut HUD issued its first news release on the inspection overhaul and its new guidance only after weeks of questions by NBC News. Carson, meanwhile, has other priorities: He recently suggested rolling back inspection requirements, rather than strengthening them, to encourage more landlords to participate in the Section 8 voucher program and has stressed the need to encourage \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d by raising rents on all Section 8 tenants.\n\nThat includes Pierre, who pays $371 a month for her three-bedroom. (HUD covers the rest of the $1,120 rent.)\n\nPierre is grateful for a place that she can afford while she works as a speech therapist and earns her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology. Her plans for the future include getting a master\u2019s and, one day, owning a home. But she worries constantly about how the mice and mold will affect her daughter\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cI don't want her to think that this is OK,\u201d Pierre said, in tears. \u201cI don't want her to become an adult and live her life like this.\u201d\n\nInfill\u2019s owner, meanwhile, is set for years to come. In July 2017, just seven months before the failed inspection, HUD renewed its contract with Isaacson for 20 years \u2014 a deal worth over $14 million.\n\nDo you have a story or tip to share with NBC News?

And not only that, I am participating in a time-honored tradition of the newly engaged: bringing the families together. Yes, for the first time ever, my parents and brother will be meeting my fiance\u2019s mother and sister over Thanksgiving dinner \u2014 in the tiny two-bedroom apartment where we live in New York City.\n\nAs thrilled as I am to be hosting (and therefore not to have to deal with one of the busiest travel days of the year), I\u2019ll be honest: I\u2019m a little stressed out. Not because I think our families won\u2019t get along \u2014 they\u2019re all great people, it should be swell! \u2014 but because I\u2019ve never cooked a holiday meal, let alone one featuring a meeting of future in-laws. And as much as I know they will all love the meal regardless, I\u2019m starting to feel immense pressure to make sure it goes perfectly. I\u2019m doing everything I can to make sure my home looks the part, that we plan ahead for the food and that everything goes as smoothly as possible the day of the feast.\n\nBut, of course, I also don\u2019t want to go overboard when it comes to Thanksgiving Day spending. We have seven total people to feed, and on top of food and drink costs, we\u2019ve already found ourselves stopping at HomeGoods to check out the tablecloth and festive placemat situation. In order to plan ahead as much as possible, I decided to reach out to a few cooking and finance experts to get the best possible advice on budgeting for the holiday. Here\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n1. Think like a chef to plan how much meat you need\n\nThis seems like a no-brainer, but it\u2019s something I could definitely miscalculate: planning the right amount of food for the people you\u2019re hosting.\n\nRick Camac, the Institute of Culinary Education\u2019s Dean of Restaurant & Hospitality Management, says to be sure to consider people, portions, and yield, especially when it comes to getting your turkey:\n\nYield means what useable product you get after the bird is cooked down and ready to serve.\n\n[Assume you need] 8 ounces of protein per person. This is a lot, but who doesn\u2019t overeat for Thanksgiving, and who doesn\u2019t want leftovers? If you\u2019re serving more than one protein (such as a ham and a turkey) obviously cut numbers in half, meaning 4 ounces of turkey and 4 ounces of ham...Assume a 50% yield on average. You\u2019ll likely get a tad better, but this is a good estimate. So, for 10 people, being served 8 ounces each, you need 5 lbs. of yield. That would call for a 10-lb. turkey. Personally, I\u2019d order 12 lbs. to be sure but, that\u2019s me.\n\nBuying too much turkey isn\u2019t the end of the world, especially if you can use the leftovers to make something delicious (my favorite is turning it into a shepherd\u2019s pie). But over-buying also means you have a bigger chance of letting your turkey go to waste \u2014 and losing money because of it. Use Camac\u2019s yield rule to make sure you get the right amount.\n\n2. Don\u2019t supply every single side dish\n\nOf course, as the host, you probably won\u2019t be simply buying a turkey. But Cherie Lowe, a personal finance blogger at Queen of Free and author of the book Slaying the Debt Dragon, says the one of the keys to saving money on Thanksgiving is to avoid the \u201cside dish trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetermining a Thanksgiving menu plan is so difficult because there is oh-so-much to choose from,\u201d she says. \u201cEven when you do determine the dishes you\u2019ll be having, hitting the grocery store is still difficult because you remember how many other things you wish you were fixing. Tough Love: You shouldn\u2019t be eating or buying all of those foods.\u201d\n\nBut how do you go about deciding what to make? \u201cIf you are dining with extended family, have everyone bring a side,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cIf you are just feeding your immediate family, focus in on one side dish each family member loves. Don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew financially or physically.\u201d\n\nWhile you may feel pressure to please everyone \u2014 as I certainly do \u2014 try to let that feeling go as much as possible. Plus, taking care of sides potluck-style means everyone has a better chance of eating their favorite sides, and you get to save money on food costs.\n\nOf course, if you\u2019re like me and have family coming in from several states away, throwing a potluck Thanksgiving is easier said than done. But don\u2019t try to bite off more than you can (literally) chew.\n\n3. Plan ahead for Wednesday\u2019s meals, too\n\nHave you ever resorted to Chinese takeout the night before Thanksgiving? I certainly have \u2014 and now I know I\u2019m definitely not alone.\n\n\u201cI once read that pizza deliveries are the highest on the night before Thanksgiving,\u201d says Lowe. To avoid becoming a part of that expensive statistic, she suggests building Wednesday night\u2019s dinner into your Thanksgiving meal plan. Even if you\u2019ll be too busy prepping to cook anything for that night, you can still avoid an expensive delivery meal.\n\n\u201cBuy a deli pizza from the grocery store and throw it in the oven while you chop foods,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cOr make sandwiches with chips. Keep it simple and if at all possible light. Just don\u2019t let that Wednesday evening meal sneak up on you as you prepare for the big day and save the room in your tummy for the big feast.\u201d\n\n4. Order online as early as possible\n\nCamac suggests buying online, and buying early, is the best way to get the best price. \u201cYou should be able to order a good quality, organic turkey for $5-6.00 per pound,\u201d he says. And to keep costs down, he suggests to stick to simple sides that please a crowd \u2014 and stretch your dollar. \u201cPotatoes are ridiculously cheap, and string beans and salad reasonably priced as well. And, potatoes are more filler! Of course, add one or two pies for dessert. All in, you can feed 10 people less than $10 per person.\u201d\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ll probably stick with the online-ordering option at Whole Foods, which my family has done for years to great success. If you want to do a little cost comparison beforehand, poke around the internet for testimonials on mail-order turkeys.\n\n5. Plan ahead for that \u201cone last thing\u201d\n\nFinally, even if you\u2019ve never hosted your own Thanksgiving, you probably know you\u2019ll forget something. To avoid this, Lowe suggests doing your actual shopping as early as you can.\n\n\u201cIf at all possible,\u201d she says, \u201cpurchase your goods DAYS before you plan on cooking. You\u2019ll want to give items like your turkey plenty of time to dethaw. Plus, you do not want to be out in the hot mess that is last minute Thanksgiving shoppers. As the days draw nearer, the crowds grow thicker.\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget: grocery stores take full advantage of last-minute holiday shoppers. \u201cRunning out at the last minute will up your stress but more than likely cause more impulse buys, too,\u201d Lowe reminds us. \u201cHoliday items are marketed front and center to grab your attention and dollars from your bank account. The odds are, you\u2019ll also be more likely to visit a higher priced grocery or convenience store (due to hours) and end up paying more and buying more, too.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve taken away from all of this, it\u2019s to plan ahead for everything. With these tips, I\u2019m hopeful my first time hosting family for Thanksgiving will go wonderfully \u2014 and I\u2019m sure yours will, too.\n\nHoliday Survival Guide\n\nWant more tips like these?

At the end of the day, I\u2019ll be able to be sworn in the Arizona Legislature on January 14th,\u201d Ter\u00e1n told reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cI now have the opportunity to work for my constituents from District 30, for better schools, better jobs, instead of focusing on a baseless lawsuit.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent phone call with NBC News, Ter\u00e1n said she thought the lawsuit was part of a larger pattern of discrimination that other Hispanics in the state have experienced.\n\n\"Kids are going through this type of harassment in their schools, [and] playgrounds, and workers have to go through this with their bosses,\" she said. \"These are things you might experience as a candidate knocking on doors. Sometimes it's subtle, but sometimes it's as direct as this lawsuit challenging your status. It is important that we denounce this.\"\n\nThis was not the first time Novoa, who unsuccessfully ran for Arizona secretary of state as a Republican write-in candidate, sued Ter\u00e1n and challenged the state representative-elect's citizenship.\n\nNovoa filed a lawsuit in 2012 when Ter\u00e1n ran for the same state office seat. The judge in the case also dismissed that lawsuit.\n\n\"I was born in Douglas, Arizona. The courts know it. I had gone through this before. I had to prove it to the same person and she knows it because she was also at the court,\" Ter\u00e1n said during a press conference in Phoenix last week when the lawsuit was filed.\n\nThe challenge to Ter\u00e1n's citizenship is similar to the questioning of Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship before, during and after his presidency, which was initially pushed by fringe groups but gained traction after it was promoted by now President Donald Trump. In her recently published memoir, former First Lady Michelle Obama said she would never forgive Trump for endangering her family by pushing this conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cWhen we see this type of harassment, we can\u2019t stand on the sidelines,\u201d Ter\u00e1n said.\n\nTer\u00e1n ran on a progressive platform such as protecting women's reproductive rights, preserving the Affordable Care Act and investing more in public schools.\n\nFor over 12 years, Ter\u00e1n has been part of a group of community organizers and advocates that have worked to counter the state's recent history of hardline immigration policies.\n\nShe was part of the successful recall of Russell Pearce, who riled the anger of the Latino community with his sponsorship of the infamous \u201cshow me your papers\u201d bill, SB1070. Since the recall, politicians have laid off the anti-immigrant legislation, Ter\u00e1n said.\n\n\"As the anti-immigrant sentiment and the attacks kept coming out of the state Legislature, people were starting to become more conscientious about us needing to participate,\u201d Ter\u00e1n added.\n\nNicole Acevedo reported from New York and Stephen Nu\u00f1o reported from Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Abrams, who is black, said it amounted to voter suppression. In early November, a federal judge sided with the civil rights groups and ordered Kemp to allow more than 3,000 people whose voter registrations were put on hold over proof-of-citizenship issues access to a ballot.\n\nAfter the election and under pressure from Democrats, Kemp resigned as secretary of state and removed himself from any role in overseeing the vote count, which is ongoing.\n\nAbrams hopes to narrow Kemp's lead to force a mandatory recount or a runoff \u2014 the higher of the two hurdles.

I dress in typical ways, with no desire to stand out. I do my job, then drive home to my wife and kid. I\u2019m the last person you\u2019d expect to suddenly show up one day with shocking, neon blue hair.\n\nBut I had no choice. I\u2019d made a promise.\n\nI oversee a team of sales representatives at Outreach, a tech company based in Seattle. Thanks to new technologies, we\u2019ve found that we can hire people straight out of college or from other fields, and get them trained quickly.\n\nIn June, I had a team of five brand new recruits who had never been in tech sales. We also had an ambitious goal: to beat all previous first-month sales records.\n\nThis required some kind of special incentive. But I had no idea how to wrangle budgets to get prizes like trips or tickets. I needed to come up with something free, but still powerful enough to motivate them.\n\nAn idea popped into my mind, so I just went with it. I told them that if we beat the record, I\u2019d dye my hair blue \u2014 and not just for a day. Permanent dye to last until it grew out.\n\nMy team laughed, and asked whether I was serious. When I said yes, their eyes lit up.\n\nThey ended up blasting the previous record out of the water. And while there are many reasons \u2014 they worked hard and we built a great process \u2014 they made clear that getting me to look like an anime character or Stanley Tucci from The Hunger Games was part of what drove them.\n\nHumor relieves stress and builds teams\n\nThere are a few reasons this idea worked. First, injecting some humor and playfulness into the atmosphere of a high-stress job can be very helpful.\n\nSales in particular can be very tough, since it means facing constant rejection. It\u2019s one of the careers with high rates of depression. When things got tough for our team during that first month, someone would crack a joke about my future look. We\u2019d laugh, and the team would push forward.\n\nThe willingness to do silly things can also help build a sense of teamwork, that we\u2019re all in this together. Richard Branson discussed this in the book \"The Mind of the CEO\", saying that as the top executive, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to be the first into the swimming pool with your clothes on or whatever, the first to let your hair down, first to make a fool out of yourself on the stage singing karaoke, to break the ice so that everybody else knows how far they can go to have fun.\u201d\n\nRisking embarrassment can inspire\n\nThere\u2019s also something more to it. I wasn\u2019t just offering something fun, I was offering to humiliate myself in a way that would last months.\n\nThe desire to see people willing to make fools of themselves for a good cause is also the thinking behind the viral ice bucket challenge that helped raise money for ALS research.\n\nThat speaks to a philosophy I\u2019ve developed about work in general. I\u2019ve found that many people are willing to work hard, but few are willing to risk personal embarrassment to achieve a goal. When someone is willing, other people admire that as a form of courage. And they want to see it play out.\n\nThis helps explain why a United Way chapter and SignUpGenius have recommended fundraiser incentives like \u201cGet the Boss\u201d or \u201cEmbarrass the Boss.\u201d Options include dunking them in a tank of water, getting them to shave their head or doing an old fashioned pie-in-the-face. The desire to see people willing to make fools of themselves for a good cause is also the thinking behind the viral ice bucket challenge that helped raise money for ALS research.\n\nPulling through\n\nWhen our sales results came in, our team celebrated. No one brought up my hair, and some of them weren\u2019t sure whether I would do it.\n\nBut that weekend, I found a stylist who spent hours putting together a concoction. He bleached my brown hair bright white to get rid of any color, then used a unique mixture to make it the most obnoxious, bright blue he could muster. It took hours and cost $250.\n\nHeading to work that Monday, I was self-conscious and very nervous. But I decided to own it. Everyone who saw me laughed \u2014 but also loved it.\n\nI also posted about it on LinkedIn. Soon, my new photo and post explaining the hair got thousands of views. It\u2019s a kind of attention I wasn\u2019t used to getting, but have found it to be a good opportunity to share ideas. In fact, I\u2019ve decided to keep my hair crazy blue for the time being.\n\nI wear it as a badge of honor. As a sign to my employees that I will pull through for them, no matter what, if they give it their all. And as a message to everyone: It isn\u2019t easy to make a fool of yourself. But if you can cross that line, one very few people are willing to cross, there is a lot of opportunity on the other side.\n\nTAKE YOUR CAREER TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Josh Lederman\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The former U.N. diplomat accused of helping steal and distribute Republican fundraiser Elliot Broidy's emails is entitled to diplomatic immunity, the U.S. government tells NBC News.\n\nIt's the latest blow to Broidy's legal campaign against Qatar and the individuals he says hacked him on its behalf. Several other defendants in lawsuits filed by Broidy including Qatar itself have already convinced the court to dismiss them from the case, which criss-crosses the murky worlds of cybercrime, the Persian Gulf diplomatic crisis and pay-to-play politics in Trump era.\n\nBroidy, the Republican National Committee's former deputy finance chair, is suing Jamal Benomar, a British citizen born in Morocco. Broidy accuses Benomar of being a \"key player\" in a Qatari scheme to hack Broidy's emails and distribute them to U.S. journalists. The stolen emails exposed how Broidy tried to parlay his access to President Donald Trump into lucrative contracts for his private security company with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Qatar's chief rivals. Qatar denies involvement in the hacking.\n\nThe complex civil case took an unexpected turn earlier this year when Benomar, who left the U.N. before the alleged hack, claimed that he is now a Moroccan diplomat, posted to the North African nation's mission to the U.N. Benomar's lawyers argued that he therefore has diplomatic immunity, and sought to have the case dismissed.\n\nBut Broidy's lawyers have said Benomar's immunity claims are \"without merit.\" They argued that Benomar only claimed to be a diplomat after Broidy sued him \u2014 and that even if he is, his immunity would only cover \"official acts\" as a diplomat, not unrelated hacking of an American citizen.\n\nNow the State Department is weighing in \u2014 and recognizing Benomar's claim to immunity.\n\nA spokesman for U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, whose office oversees recognition of U.N. diplomats, says it reviewed Morroco's accreditation of Benomar and its request for immunity to ensure it met requirements in U.S. and international law.\n\nThe U.N. secretary-general's special adviser, Jamal Benomar, at a news conference on Oct 13, 2016. Albin Lohr-Jones / Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images file\n\n\"Based on this information, we have registered Benomar with diplomatic privileges and immunities,\" Haley's office, known as the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said in a written statement.\n\nThat determination about Benomar's immunity was also conveyed in writing Wednesday to lawyers on both sides of the case.\n\nA U.S. official, describing the official U.S. position, tells NBC News that Benomar's immunity is not limited to his \"official acts\" as a diplomat. Rather, the official says the U.S. is recognizing Benomar as having \"status immunity\" \u2014 which means he's protected from civil suits even for conduct unrelated to his service as a Moroccan diplomat. That's because the Moroccans have now accredited Benomar at the rank of \"minister plenipotentiary\" \u2014 a high-level title just below that of an ambassador.\n\nIt's unclear whether Benomar has had that rank since becoming a Moroccan diplomat sometime this year, or whether the Moroccans upgraded his status more recently to ensure he'd have full immunity. In court filings, lawyers for Benomar and Broidy have wrangled over his exact rank and when exactly it took effect. The U.S. government says it registered Benomar with diplomatic immunity as of Tuesday.\n\nThe Moroccan Mission to the U.N. did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBenomar's attorney, Abbe Lowell, provided the court Wednesday with emails from Haley's office showing that with his new accreditation in hand, he'll be getting a new diplomatic passport and diplomatic ID card within the next few days.\n\n\"The case must be dismissed,\" wrote Lowell, who frequently represents high-profile clients including Jared Kushner.\n\nElliott Broidy and Robin Broidy in 2012 Alex J. Berliner / ABImages via AP Images file\n\nBut Broidy's lawyer, former Ambassador Lee Wolosky, has provided documentation to the court alleging that Benomar, at the same time as he claimed to be a Moroccan diplomat, was also performing \"for-profit work for Qatar.\" Broidy's lawyers say that allegation, along with Benomar being a permanent resident of the U.S., make him ineligible for legal immunity regardless of what the State Department says.\n\n\"The record before the court, and not the statements of spokespeople, will determine how the court will rule,\" Wolosky tells NBC News. \"The record demonstrates that Mr. Benomar, who is alleged to have participated in a hacking conspiracy against a U.S. citizen, is not entitled to status immunity.\"\n\nBut for months, Broidy's lawyers had argued before the court that the State Department's assessment of his immunity would be the final word. His lawyers cited multiple past cases in which courts ruled that \"a person's diplomatic status is established when it is recognized by the Department of State\" and that \"a determination of the Department of State is binding upon the court.\"\n\nJulian Ku, who teaches international law at Hofstra University and isn't involved in the case, says that ultimately, it's up to the judge in the civil case to determine whether the immunity claim is legally valid. But he says that because diplomatic immunity claims are so rare, the courts generally follow the lead of the U.S. government.\n\nJamal Benomar, then the U.N. envoy to Yemen, in 2011. Benomar is being sued by Elliott Broidy, a former RNC deputy finance chair. Mohammed Huwais / AFP/Getty Images file\n\n\"Most courts will defer to the State Department's views on a question like this,\" Ku says. \"It's not binding, but it's super persuasive.\"\n\nThe U.S. Mission to the U.N., which is part of the State Department, wouldn't comment on Broidy's civil case. But it said that before making its immunity determination, it checked with the Justice Department and is \"not aware of any pending criminal charges against Mr. Benomar.\" In the statement, the mission also said that Haley, who is stepping down as U.N. ambassador later this year, \"played no part in reviewing this case.\"\n\nThe U.S. government has little discretion in deciding who should or shouldn't get immunity, but merely reviews the law and documents submitted by the foreign country to see whether the criteria are met. The U.S. generally has to defer to foreign countries to accredit whoever they want as U.N. diplomats because of the United States' obligations as the host country for the U.N. headquarters in New York.\n\nBenomar's claim to be a Moroccan diplomat was particularly surprising given that decades ago, after voicing opposition to Morocco's government, he was arrested there and tortured. He later became a U.N. diplomat who rose through the ranks to become the U.N. special envoy for Yemen.\n\nAlthough Qatar denies involvement in hacking Broidy's emails, it had an obvious potential motive for trying to embarrass him. At the same time that Broidy and Lebanese-American businessman George Nader were seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts from the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Broidy was orchestrating an extensive lobbying and public relations campaign against Qatar in the United States, emails later published by various U.S. news outlets showed.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE accuse Qatar of funding terrorism and fomenting dissent throughout the region and have been boycotting the tiny gas-rich nation since last year, in a diplomatic crisis that has roiled the Persian Gulf.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

CNN had sought the order to recover Acosta's \"hard pass,\" which granted him access to the White House.\n\nJustice Department lawyers including Joseph Hunt, the assistant attorney general in charge of the department's civil division, submitted the filing Wednesday morning, hours before a 3:30 p.m. ET hearing on the lawsuits.\n\n\"The President and White House possess the same broad discretion to regulate access to the White House for journalists (and other members of the public) that they possess to select which journalists receive interviews, or which journalists they acknowledge at press conferences,\" the filing says.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearing, Judge Timothy J. Kelly did not issue a decision on the restraining order and said he would return at 3 p.m. ET on Thursday with a ruling.\n\nAcosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, was denied access to the White House on Nov. 7, hours after Trump verbally berated him as a \"rude, terrible person.\" Acosta at a news conference had questioned Trump about a group of migrants traveling north toward the U.S.-Mexico border and entered into a contentious exchange with the president and refused to give up a microphone when the president tried to move to a different reporter.\n\nCNN sued, saying that Acosta's rights had been violated and that the network wanted to \"ensure that the press remains free to question the government and to report the business of the nation to the American people.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's filing, the Justice Department argued that Acosta's actions provided the White House with a clear reason to revoke his hard pass.\n\n\"The stated rationale for the revocation of Mr. Acosta\u2019s pass \u2014 that he was disrupting press proceedings \u2014 is evident from the video he has proffered, is entirely viewpoint- and content-neutral,\" the filing says.\n\nThe Justice Department also argued that Acosta was still able to do his job and that CNN has \"roughly 50 other employees who retain hard passes and who are more than capable of covering the White House complex.\"\n\nMedia outlets have broadly supported CNN's lawsuit.

But the eruption from my physician colleagues on social media was startling. Responding to the NRA\u2019s central point \u2014 that doctors should \u201cstay in their lane\u201d on the topic of guns \u2014 medical professionals created a viral hashtag, #ThisISMyLane (also #ThisISOurLane), sharing vivid stories of their clinical experiences with gunshot wound victims, arguing that, despite what the NRA might believe, the issue falls unavoidably into the laps of medical practitioners.\n\nPhysicians appeared on NBC and CNN, wrote editorial after editorial, and crafted an open letter to the NRA which read, in part: \u201cphysicians, nurses, therapists, medical professionals, and other concerned community members want to tell you that we are absolutely \u2018in our lane\u2019 when we propose solutions to prevent death and disability from gun violence.\u201d As of this writing, the letter \u2014 which concludes with an invitation for the NRA to \u201ccollaborate with us to find workable, effective strategies to diminish the death toll\u201d \u2014 has been signed by over 30,000 health professionals, an uncommon display of solidarity.\n\nWhy was the response so impassioned? Because the medical community has been censored on this issue before, and it was to our shame and regret.\n\nOver the past 30 years, physicians \u2014 working in concert with epidemiologists, social workers, basic and clinical scientists as well as a wide variety of health workers, communities and industries \u2014 have helped achieve major public health victories, including reductions in cigarette smoking and motor vehicle accidents, as well as life-saving treatments for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.\n\nBut we have stood by helplessly on firearm safety as politicians and lobbyists blocked us from applying standard scientific approaches to gun violence. We weren\u2019t admonished to stay in our lane, exactly \u2014 instead we were told to ignore a health crisis unfolding right in front of us, squarely in our lane. And for the most part, we did.\n\nHealth professionals have realized we can no more neglect searching for solutions to gun violence than we can decline to resuscitate a patient dying of sepsis or heart failure in front of us.\n\nUltimately, however, health professionals have realized we can no more neglect searching for solutions to gun violence than we can decline to resuscitate a patient dying of sepsis or heart failure in front of us \u2014 or to refuse to work toward preventing the next case. We don\u2019t stand at bedsides categorizing health problems as \u201cpolitically acceptable\u201d or \u201ctoo hot to handle.\u201d We care about them all, and this is never truer than when harm is preventable, as with most injuries. The healthy toddler who fell out of an unsecured window, or into a pool with a gate left ajar. The suicide in which the most accessible means of self-harm was a particularly effective and irreversible one.\n\nWhile doctors want to prevent harm as a general concept, the trauma of gun violence is accompanied by a specific experience. As signified in the #ThisIsOurLane hashtag, caring for trauma victims does not allow us to forget our responsibility to mitigate suffering. And now the country is witnessing what happens when the burden of this cumulative horror is borne by a new generation of physician-advocates increasingly uncomfortable with inaction.\n\nToday, the notion that physicians should be restricted to bedside caregiving is hopelessly antiquated. Advocacy training is now a standard component of residency curricula. The roles of physician and public health advocate grow more intertwined with each passing year. Many of our healthcare leaders have been outspoken about the necessity of physicians to advance health through advocacy.\n\n\u201cIt is chilling to see the great institutions of health care, hospitals, physician groups, scientific bodies assume that the seat of bystander is available. That seat is gone,\u201d wrote Dr. Donald Berwick, the former director of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in a 2017 commentary in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \u201cTo try to avoid the political fray through silence is impossible, because silence is now political. Either engage, or assist the harm. There is no third choice.\u201d\n\nSitting in silence while we treat gunshot wound after gunshot wound is no longer possible, unless we wish to be complicit in perpetuating the problem.\n\nThe rising generation of physicians is more wired to this message than any before, and it is their voices that moved me most this week. Sitting in silence while we treat gunshot wound after gunshot wound is no longer possible, unless we wish to be complicit in perpetuating the problem.\n\nIs it difficult to fight the status quo? It is. But those who have been in a trauma room, soaked to the skin in the blood of a child who was healthy an hour ago, watching his eyes dilate to black and knowing all is lost \u2014 well, we have received a clear, strong directive.\n\nFew physicians can tell you how a carburetor works. But we can tell you, with impressive accuracy, how every beer you consume affects the possibility that you will be in an accident if you drive afterwards. There is a tremendous amount of literature on this topic. And note: We don\u2019t argue for universal abstinence from either drinking or driving. We can be both deeply interested in mitigating the established harms of alcohol, while still at peace with the six-packs of beer in the fridge and the cars in the driveway of homes across the country (including our own).\n\nThe same goes for firearms. Like swimming pools, hang-gliders and airway-sized chunks of hotdog, guns are not going away any time soon, and we hope to coexist with them while minimizing their potential to rip away the lives of our loved ones.\n\nDoctors and other healthcare workers are not looking to be extreme in our approach to firearm injuries. We only wish to consider gun safety using the same bland, unexciting, methodical, scientific framework we apply to any other threat to the public\u2019s health.\n\nStay in our lane? Doctors are comfortably in their lane, and that lane includes an imperative to reduce firearm injuries and deaths. It always has.

Three years ago she settled down in Chile, where most of her family has also relocated.\n\n\u201cI represent the new Chile,\u201d the 26-year-old said as she was training at a local gym in Santiago for the upcoming competition. \u201cThis is an inclusive country where immigrants come in search of opportunities.\u201d\n\nAs thousands of people leave Venezuela each day to escape food shortages and an inflation rate that is expected to surpass 1 million percent, dozens of would-be beauty queens are also taking flight and finding work as models and media personalities overseas.\n\nSome are even representing their adopted homelands in international beauty pageants.\n\nNext month, Portugal will be represented at the Miss World competition in China by a former Miss Venezuela participant. And the recently concluded Miss Earth Contest, held in the Philippines, featured two Venezuelan models who competed on behalf of Peru and Spain.\n\n\u201cMy dream of being a beauty queen was not going to stop just because I arrived in a new country,\u201d said Jessica Russo, who represented Peru in Miss Earth, just a year after moving to that country.\n\nShe failed to make it into the finals but said she will now train for more pageants, where she hopes to win a crown for Peru, the country where her mother was born.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still young,\u201d said the 22-year-old. \u201cAnd I want to be a global spokeswoman for good causes.\u201d\n\nBeauty pageants are followed almost as closely as baseball in Venezuela, which has long been obsessed with glamour and good looks. The South American country is a world leader in international pageants, with seven Miss Universe crowns and six Miss World titles.\n\nWhile critics have described the pageants as misogynous and antiquated, they are defended by many Venezuelans who say the events have helped hundreds of women from all social classes launch careers as models, actresses, TV hosts and news presenters. One former Miss Venezuela winner even served as a mayor of a district in Caracas and ran \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 for the country\u2019s presidency.\n\nIn this Oct. 11, 2018 photo, Venezuelan born Jessica Russo, representing Peru in the Miss Earth 2018 beauty pageant, parades during the media presentation in the Miss Earth 2018 Beauty pageant in Manila, Philippines. Bullit Marquez / AP\n\nBut as Venezuela\u2019s economy plunges, the country\u2019s many pageants no longer offer a direct path to employment. Live fashion shows have ground to a halt, TV productions have slowed down and companies such as fashion brands increasingly refrain from spending money on advertisements.\n\nGiselle Reyes runs four modeling schools for young women in Venezuela that she touts as the \u201cuniversity of beauty.\u201d She estimates around 70 percent of her graduates have left the country over the past decade to seek modeling jobs in Mexico, Colombia, the United States and other countries.\n\n\u201cI even have a tough time finding modeling instructors now,\u201d Reyes said at a studio in Caracas that is lined with photos of celebrity Venezuelan pageant winners. \u201cPeople always tell me they will work for me for a few months while they find a way to leave the country.\u201d\n\nEven Venezuela\u2019s most competitive beauty pageant no longer seems to guarantee its graduates a job in their own country.\n\nThe nationally televised Miss Venezuela contest chooses 24 participants each year and puts them through a grueling six-month academy that includes daily gym routines, modeling lessons and pep talks from instructors who sometimes coax their pupils into having plastic surgery.\n\nBut at least 17 members of the Miss Venezuela class of 2015 appear to be working abroad in Mexico, Colombia, Turkey and even as far away as India, according to a web search of their social media profiles. The number of 2014 contestants working overseas is similar.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201990s, participating in Miss Venezuela virtually guaranteed you work in modeling or in TV,\u201d said Rafael Briceno, a Caracas-based radio host who has given public speaking classes to dozens of Miss Venezuela participants. \u201cNow the local market for models is very small.\u201d\n\nMany of the Venezuelan beauty queens who have gone abroad credit their rigid preparation in Venezuela with helping them to succeed. But they also are relieved to be free of the demanding, cookie-cutter beauty standards imposed by pageant organizers at home.\n\nDiaz said that while she was still living in Venezuela, she went to a skin cleansing session that went wrong and left small scars and reddish blotches on both her cheeks. Modeling agencies in Venezuela then started to reject her.\n\nIn Chile, Diaz was able to win the national beauty contest despite the rashes, which can be easily hidden with makeup. She was able to participate because her father is Chilean.\n\n\u201cChile accepted me as I am and helped me to regain the confidence I had lost,\u201d Diaz said.\n\nNow, as she readies for the Miss Universe pageant next month in Thailand, the model hopes that the jury doesn\u2019t just focus on her physical attributes but sees her as a cosmopolitan woman who has moved around the world in pursuit of her goals. She says that she dreams of becoming a motivational speaker working with youth on self-esteem issues.\n\n\u201cA beautiful woman is not just a woman with perfect skin,\u201d Diaz said, \u201cbut someone with a heart, with ideas and a sense of purpose.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The annual report showed there were 7,175 bias crimes in 2017 involving 8,828 victims. Victims targeted due to their sexual orientation or gender identity comprised 1,470 \u2014 or nearly 17 percent \u2014 of all victims.\n\nThe 1,470 victims were involved in 1,249 separate bias incidents. Nearly 60 percent of these incidents targeted gay men, 25 percent targeted a mix of LGBTQ people, 12 percent targeted lesbians, 3 percent targeted heterosexuals, 2 percent targeted bisexuals and 1 percent targeted transgender and gender-nonconforming people.\n\nThe number of hate crimes motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias has remained relatively steady, from a high of 1,256 in 2010 to a low of 1,097 in 2014. Since 2014, the total number has increased every year. But what has also remained constant is the portion of overall hate crimes that are motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias: between 17 and 21 percent. (Note: data on trans and gender nonconforming-related bias incidents starts in 2013.)\n\nThe lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is estimated by Gallup to comprise 4.5 percent of the U.S. population, yet according to the FBI\u2019s newly released report, they make up more than 16 percent of federally reported hate crime victims (subtracting those targeted due to their heterosexuality from the 17 percent figure above). The Jewish and black communities also shoulder a disproportionate percentage of federally reported hate crimes: Jewish people comprise an estimated 2 percent of the U.S. population but make up 11.5 percent of hate crime victims, and the black community is an estimated 13.4 percent of the U.S. population but makes up 28 percent of hate crime victims.\n\nFrank Pezzella, a criminology professor at New York\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the increase in this year\u2019s number of federally reported hate crimes is alarming \u2014 but still likely a gross undercount of the total number of bias incidents, because many \u2014 perhaps most \u2014 hate crimes go unreported.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge difference between the annual [FBI] hate crime report and the 252,000 hate crime victimizations that are reported each year,\u201d Pezzella explained, referring to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).\n\nThe annual FBI hate crimes report is based on \u201cUniform Crime Reports,\u201d which are statistics reported to the FBI by state and local law enforcement agencies. However, Pezzella said only 75 percent of the approximately 18,5000 police agencies participate in hate crime reporting, and of those who do participate, nearly 90 percent \u201creport zero hate crimes every year.\u201d\n\nFor a better overview of the scale of bias crimes, Pezzella pointed the NCVS, which is administered by the U.S. Census Bureau and asks victims directly about their exposure to crime. Pezzella said the NCVS is a better gauge of bias victimization, in part, because it allows victims who are part of marginalized groups \u2014 like undocumented hispanics, blacks and LGBTQ people \u2014 to bypass law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe LGBT community,\u201d Pezella explained, \u201cdo not report hate crimes, and we argue because of the strained relationship with the police,\u201d he said. He also added that the most common answers to the NCVS question about why respondents don\u2019t report crime are \u201cpolice apathetic, police bias\u201d and police ineffective.\u201d\n\nDespite what Pezzella perceives as flaws in the FBI\u2019s hate crimes data, which has been published in some form since 1990, he said it still provides useful information.\n\n\u201cThere are obvious holes in the data,\u201d he lamented. However, he added, \u201cit does provide us 30 years of baseline figures.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Most money goes to three exclusive drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and other autoimmune diseases, the analysis shows.\n\nFederal health officials and the health insurance industry have been encouraging doctors to prescribe more generic drugs in the hope of saving money, and they are. But new data from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association shows that its insurance company members are paying out more than ever for specialty name-brand drugs.\n\n\u201cExpensive branded prescription drugs accounted for only 17 percent of total prescriptions filled, but 79 percent of total prescription drug spending ($79.5 billion),\u201d Blue Cross Blue Shield said in its report.\n\n\u201cMore expensive branded prescription drug spending is up 4 percent since 2016.\u201d\n\nDrug prices are a major target of patient groups and Congress. Although drug spending makes up only 10 percent of the $3.3 trillion spent on U.S. healthcare in a year, the sometimes eye-watering prices charged for new cancer, hepatitis and immune therapy treatments regularly attract criticism.\n\nMost Americans get their health insurance coverage, including coverage for prescription drugs, from an employer\u2019s provision of private health insurance. Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s analysis looks at drug spending from the perspective of a major private insurer.\n\nThe company\u2019s researchers analyzed medical claims from 41 million clients, and extrapolated them to the 88 million people covered by BCBS.\n\nThe company shells out $100 billion for prescription drugs, or 20 percent of all its spending.\n\n\u201cTotal prescription drug spending increased 10 percent annually since 2010,\u201d the report found. And most prescriptions \u2014 82 percent \u2014 were for cheaper, generic drugs.\n\nBut most of the spending went for brand-name prescription drugs. \u201cExpensive branded drugs accounted for only 18 percent of total prescriptions filled, but 78 percent of total spending,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cCosts for single-source drugs with no generic alternatives increased at more than double the rate of average annual drug spending.\n\nAlthough new cancer immunotherapies and hepatitis drugs grab the headlines with their $100,000-plus price tags, the biggest costs came from three top rheumatoid arthritis drugs: Humira, Remicade and Enbrel, the analysis showed.\n\nA quick-acting insulin, Novolog, was the fourth-leading cost-driver and Neulasta, an immune-boosting product for cancer patients, came in fifth.\n\nHumira, an anti-inflammatory drug that tamps down the immune system, is currently the best-selling drug in the world. It costs about $38,000 a year, according to SSR Health. The spending is high in part because rheumatoid arthritis is so common, affecting 1.3 million to 1.8 million Americans.\n\nThe analysis does not include the effects of drug rebates, which companies often cite as a way to reduce the costs for their products.\n\n\u201cSteady annual increases in branded patent-protected prescription costs drive the majority of spending in the branded drug space, growing 5 percent in the past year alone,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nIn 2017, the independent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review found that targeted treatments for rheumatoid arthritis were highly effective but probably cost more than they were worth.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It had electric lights and a hydraulic system to lift away flooring that was covered by a pool table. Inside the tunnel, there were carts that were used to speed along tons of cocaine across the border.\n\nThe prosecution says Mexican Drug Lord Joaquin Guzman, \"El Chapo\" used tunnels to speed drug deliveries to America.

Zambada remains on the loose in Mexico, Lichtman claimed, because of bribes that \"go up to the very top,\" including hundreds of millions of dollars paid to the current and former presidents of Mexico.\n\nIn a court filing overnight, prosecutors urged Judge Brian Cogan to throw out Lichtman's statement, saying he made wild allegations he could not prove.\n\nThe judge didn't go that far, but he did admonish Lichtman for having gone \"far afield of direct or circumstantial proof.\" He said he would instruct the jury to focus on the evidence.\n\n\"Your opening statement handed out a promissory note that your case is not going to cash,\" the judge said, calling Lichtman's opening misleading.\n\nLichtman said his client was not the real leader of the cartel - he was just someone who enjoyed having an oversized reputation.\n\nJeffrey Lichtman, attorney for Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, arrives at the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse on Nov. 14, 2018.

The judge has yet to act on the state's request for expedited consideration of its motion.\n\nPresident Donald Trump named Whitaker acting attorney general under a law known as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which allows a president to fill a vacant cabinet position with a senior employee of the affected agency. Whitaker had been the chief of staff to Jeff Sessions, who was forced to resign as attorney general last week.\n\nBut Maryland said a separate federal law governs what happens when the office of attorney general is vacant. It provides that the deputy attorney general takes over, which would be Rod Rosenstein.\n\nWednesday's Justice Department legal guidance said courts have previously held that the president has the option of either using the Vacancies Reform Act to fill a vacant cabinet-level job or allowing the deputy to take over.\n\nThe Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has weighed in before on the president's legal authority to use the Vacancy Act to bypass the department's normal order of succession and pick someone not in line to move up. But that opinion, written in 2007 after the resignation of Alberto Gonzales as attorney general, assumed that the president's pick already held a Senate-confirmed job.\n\nMaryland also argued that the appointment of Whitaker violates a provision of the Constitution that specifies that top positions in the government can be filled only by someone who has been confirmed by the Senate. Whitaker's appointment bypassed that process.\n\nBut Engel's opinion said the Justice Department has identified over 160 times throughout U.S. history when presidents appointed non-Senate confirmed government officials to serve in high level positions. In recent years, the opinion said, such appointments were made by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nThe opinion said that while courts have held that the Constitution requires principal officers to be confirmed by the Senate, \"it does not follow that Acting Attorney General should be understood to be one,\" because the person appointed to serve in that capacity is not in a \"continuing and permanent\" position.\n\nMaryland's motion came in a lawsuit over the future of Obamacare, seeking a ruling that the Affordable Care Act remains enforceable despite attempts by the Trump administration to shut it down. It named several defendants, including Sessions, who was attorney general when the case was filed in September. With Sessions gone, Maryland said, the judge overseeing the lawsuit should declare that the attorney general defendant cannot be Whitaker.\n\nHarvard law professor Laurence Tribe called the Maryland lawsuit entirely legitimate.\n\n\"They're saying that since Jeff Sessions is no longer the attorney general, they can't be expected to engage in this battle against a kind of cloud that might just go pop the moment someone concludes, as they should, that Matt Whitaker is not constitutionally qualified to play that role,\" Tribe said.\n\n\"If they're right about that, and I think they are, this is the way to have it declared.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

On the one hand, she remains incredibly unpopular \u2014 her fav/unfav rating in last week\u2019s national exit poll was 31 percent positive, 56 percent negative (-25).\n\nOn the other hand, top Democrats are adamant that she\u2019s the only House Democrat who could do the job. \u201cWe need the strongest general that we have. We need the best tactician. We need the best organizer,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d last Sunday. \u201cAnd that's her.\u201d\n\nAnother problem for Pelosi as speaker: Twelve incoming Democratic freshmen who won last week say they won\u2019t support her for speaker. That number could jump to 16 if Gil Cisneros (in CA-39), Jared Golden (in ME-2), Andy Kim (in NJ-3) and Ben McAdams in (UT-4) eventually win their races. If Democrats end up flipping 38 House seats, they can afford only 15 defections to keep their majority. And we\u2019re not even mentioning the current members of Congress who\u2019ve said they won\u2019t support Pelosi.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem for Pelosi\u2019s opponents: There is currently no other House Democrat stepping forward to take her on. \u201cAsked about how the Pelosi defectors could beat somebody with nobody, [Rep.

For one thing, some new and old members might vote against Pelosi in the closed-door caucus meeting on Nov. 28 \u2014 where she needs only a simple majority from her own party \u2014 and still vote for her on the floor on Jan. 3, when she needs a majority of ALL members to become speaker.\n\nAlso on Jan. 3, Pelosi opponents could vote \u201cpresent,\u201d reducing the magic number she needs to capture a majority.\n\nStill, none of this is easy for Democrats.\n\n12 incoming House Democrats who say they won\u2019t support Pelosi\n\nCO-6: Democrat Jason Crow to the Denver Post in July: \u201cI won\u2019t be supporting Nancy Pelosi \u2026 I want new leadership to set up and move this country forward.\u201d\n\nCT-5: Democrat Jahana Hayes in an August debate: \"I would not vote for Nancy Pelosi.\"\n\nMI-8: Democrat Elissa Slotkin, to the Washington Post in May: \u201cI think it\u2019s clear that on both sides of the aisle, people are seeking new leadership, and I\u2019m going to be looking for someone who best represents my district and what we care about here.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Leigh Ann Caldwell and Alex Moe\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans in Congress elected a new slate of leaders Wednesday as the party braces for the new reality of divided government.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy of California overcame a conservative challenge by Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio to become the House minority leader while Senate Republicans re-elected Sen. Mitch McConnell as their leader.\n\nSoon to be in the minority, House Republicans will head into the next congressional session with a smaller, more conservative and less diverse caucus. And they will find themselves with much less power, a new experience for House GOP members who have been in the majority since 2010.\n\n\"Let\u2019s face it, when you are in the minority, your job is just to vote no on what goes on,\" said Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., who was re-elected last week despite facing federal charges of insider trading. \"You don\u2019t control the hearings, you don\u2019t control the legislation. So it is going to be a different world for all of us.\"\n\nWith Speaker Paul Ryan leaving Congress after not seeking re-election, McCarthy, who is his deputy, will take the top spot against a Democratic majority intent on investigating the president and maintaining their grip on power beyond the 2020 elections. House Democrats will hold their leadership elections on November 28.\n\nMcCarthy beat Jordan with a vote of 159-43. Jordan is a founding member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose bid for leadership represents a show of conservative force. McCarthy has been the heir apparent, however, since Ryan announced his resignation last year.\n\nMcCarthy told reporters after a GOP conference meeting Tuesday night that his goal is to \"continue to move America forward.\"\n\nHe said GOP members talked about the Democrats' agenda that he said centers on \"trying to impeach the president\" and investigating the administration. \"I just think America is too great for such a small vision, so we will continue to work to make America move forward, and our second goal is to make sure we win the majority back,\" McCarthy said.\n\nOne demand from members of the new leader is to come up with an alternative to the Democrats' online fundraising platform, Act Blue, and to commit to raising more money than they did last cycle where Democrats vastly outraised them, even with a $30 million cash infusion from GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.\n\nMcCarthy is set to lead a more conservative conference after many of their more moderate, suburban members lost their seats in the midterm elections.\n\nAnd it will be a less racially and gender diverse conference. Fewer Republican women will serve in the next Congress despite record-breaking numbers of female Democrats who will serve. All but one of the 31 Republican freshman, whose races have been decided so far, are white men, resulting in a conference that is nearly 90 percent white and male. That is a stark comparison to House Democrats, where fewer than 40 percent of their House members are white men.\n\nThe GOP leadership ranks will still have one woman, however, after Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming was unanimously elected to become the GOP conference chair. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, who currently holds that position, did not see it again.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s always good to have as many women as possible to have as much diversity as possible represented, but I think at the end of the day what really matters is our policies,\" Cheney said. \"I\u2019m really looking forward to having the chance of being able to talk about why those Republican policies are the right ones for both women and men.\"\n\nHer father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, attended the closed-door leadership election.\n\nSenate Republicans, who retained their majority, are also holding leadership elections on Wednesday. The GOP caucus will see far fewer changes in leadership structure and will have at least one more seat as a result of the midterm elections, perhaps two depending on the final outcome in Florida.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky ran unopposed for majority leader and was re-elected Wednesday morning, extending his record-breaking rein as the longest-serving Senate Republican leader.\n\nBut there has been a shake-up down the ranks as all the other leadership spots are subject to term limits.\n\nSen. John Thune of South Dakota was elected as party whip, the second-ranking leadership post. He replaces Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., was elected to Republican conference chair. And Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., will be chair of the Republican Policy Committee chair.\n\nThe fifth-highest spot in the caucus, vice chair, was the only contested position. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa beat out Sens. Deb Fischer of Nebraska Ernst is the first woman to serve in the GOP leadership since Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska left that post in 2010.\n\nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., will be the new chair of the Senate's campaign committee, the NRSC.\n\nSenate Democrats also held their leadership elections Wednesday with no changes. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will continue as leader with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., as whip. Assistant Democratic Leader Patty Murray of Washington remains in her position.\n\nThe Democrats maintained a large leadership group to encompass all voices, ranging from moderate West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and liberal Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nOne thing that could get complicated for Democrats, however, is as many as three members of leadership are considering running for president, which often pits senators running for re-election against those with presidential ambitions.\n\nHere is the rest of the Democratic leadership:\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.: Chair of Policy and Communications Committee\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass: Vice Chair of Conference\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va.: Vice Chair of Conference\n\nSen.

White\n\nAlthough growth in the housing market is slowing, the number of million-dollar homes in the United States is on the rise, creating pockets of affluence in a housing market experts say is becoming increasingly unaffordable.\n\nNew research from real estate site Trulia found that roughly 3 million homes across the country today are worth $1 million or more. This amounts to around 3.6 percent of the entire housing market; just six years ago, only 1.5 percent of all homes had million-dollar price tags.\n\nTrulia found that the number of seven-figure homes and the highest rate of increases are overwhelmingly concentrated in California. In San Francisco alone, four out of five homes crack the million-dollar threshold. Outside of the Golden State, Honolulu, Seattle and Long Island, N.Y., also saw major increases in homes worth $1 million or more.\n\nAt just over 14 percent, San Jose had the highest year-over-year increase in million-dollar homes, according to Trulia\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cThe areas I\u2019m concerned about are the areas that aren\u2019t responding where prices are still accelerating, like San Jose,\u201d said Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at Attom Data Solutions. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign that these areas have such constrained inventory that there are hardly any properties just sitting vacant. That\u2019s continuing to put upward pressure on prices,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\nThese kinds of increases aren\u2019t sustainable, Blomquist suggested. \u201cThat seems to defy reason a little bit and those are\u2026 red flags there.\u201d\n\nIn the rest of the country, it\u2019s another story. \u201cThe tax law changed the benefit of various deductions for housing \u2014 that\u2019s hurting certain markets,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.\n\nThe average home price in August rose by an annualized 5.8 percent, the fifth month in a row in which price appreciation slowed, and dropping below the 6 percent threshold for the first time in a year, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index.\n\nPrice gains are slowing, but this isn\u2019t making houses any more affordable \u2014 because mortgage rates are rising, which is cooling demand for homes. \u201cThe survey's 30-year fixed-rate, at 5.15 percent, was the highest since April 2010,\" said Joel Kan, associate vice president of economic and industry forecasts for the Mortgage Bankers Association, in a recent report. The MBA\u2019s weekly survey found that mortgage applications for both purchases and refinancings fell by 4 percent for the week ending Nov. 2, a nearly four-year low.\n\nZandi also said Trump\u2019s tax policies were acting as a brake on the market. \u201cHousing is already being affected because of all the fiscal stimulus,\u201d he said, because the massive amount of short-term stimulus injected into the economy by the deficit-funded tax cuts is pushing up borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cIn the last year the benchmark 30-year, fixed mortgage rate has climbed more than one percentage point,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cThere is a very pronounced impact on affordability. A year ago, for somebody who was approved for a maximum loan of $250,000, at today\u2019s rates \u2014 all else being equal \u2014 they\u2019d only be approved for a loan of $220,000,\u201d he said.\n\nBut although mortgage rates overall are rising, the richest homebuyers are insulated to a greater degree than other borrowers. That\u2019s because so-called jumbo loans \u2014 those above $453,100 in most of the U.S., or above $679,650 in high-priced areas like New York City \u2014 are generally held in-house by banks rather than packaged into securities and sold off to investors. \u201cJumbo mortgages are not dependent on the secondary market,\u201d Bankrate\u2019s McBride said. \u201cIndividual lenders have a lot more flexibility on pricing.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Instead, researchers led by Olivier Sulpis, a graduate student at McGill University in Montreal, simulated seafloor conditions in a laboratory. The simulations showed that the mineral, a form of calcium carbonate known as calcite, is being replaced by murky brown sediments.\n\nCalcite is made of the skeletons and shells of marine organisms laid down over millions of years, and its loss would represent more than an aesthetic matter. The mineral acts as a chemical buffer, neutralizing the carbonic acid that forms when carbon dioxide seeps from the atmosphere into the ocean. The reaction helps prevent runaway acidification of seawater.\n\nBut with cars and factories spewing so much carbon dioxide spewing into the atmosphere, the scientists say, the calcite can't keep up. As a result, the oceans are becoming more acidic.\n\nOcean acidification is bad news for sea creatures. Roughly 250 million years ago, during the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event, unusually acidic oceans drove more than 90 percent of marine species to extinction. \u201cIt seems that we are at the dawn of one of these catastrophic events, and we don\u2019t need to look far to find the cause of it,\u201d Sulpis told NBC News MACH in an email.\n\nNot everyone is particularly worried about the depletion of calcite.\n\nWallace Broecker, a Columbia University climate scientist who was not involved in the new study, said in an email that it \u201cgreatly overplays\u201d the calcite problem. The dissolving of calcite \u201coccurs naturally on a large scale in the deep sea,\u201d he said. \u201cA tiny bit more will have no consequence.\u201d\n\nSulpis said the slow depletion of calcite matters, in part because it's unlikely to end anytime soon. Even if emissions of carbon dioxide ended today, he said, it would take centuries for the excess CO2 to stop dissolving the seafloor.\n\nThen there's the stark realization that humanity's effect on our environment is disturbingly pervasive. As Sulpis put it, \"Even at places on our planet where we have never set foot, or that have never been seen by human eyes, such as the deep sea, there is a trace of human activity.\"\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Often called \u201cESG investing\u201d (environmental, social and governance), \u201cSRI\u201d (socially responsible investing), \u201cCSR investing\u201d (corporate social responsibility) or simply \u201cimpact investing,\u201d the concept has been around for years, but millennials are charting new territory when it comes to doing good with their money.\n\nToday, 43 percent of millennials are more likely to consider making impact investments versus only a third of Generation Xers and a quarter of Boomers. When those surveyed were asked what\u2019s more important \u2014 making money or making an impact \u2014 the majority of all investors (67 percent) said they would prioritize having an impact. \u201cThey aren\u2019t saying, \u2018I\u2019m willing to lose money,\u2019 but they are saying, \u2018Even if I have to get a slightly lower return, I\u2019m okay with that to improve social issues and company governance,\u2019\u201d says Lule Demmissie, managing director of investment at TD Ameritrade.\n\nThe Global Impact Investing Network reported that nearly $140 billion was invested in impact investment strategies, up from just $10.6 billion in 2014 \u2014 a staggering increase.\n\nExcept that, they often don\u2019t. Impact investments have outperformed the benchmark for eight out of the last 10 years, according to the MSCI ESG Leaders Index. During the same period, impact investments also showed they were better protected from the downside in the market. That\u2019s why even people who aren\u2019t so passionate about saving the world may want to get on the bandwagon (and why the bandwagon is turning into quite the parade.) In May, the Global Impact Investing Network reported that nearly $140 billion was invested in impact investment strategies, up from just $10.6 billion in 2014 \u2014 a staggering increase. Additionally, impact investment network Toniic reports that its members now have $2.8 billion total in impact investments, up more than $1 billion since 2016.\n\n\u201cAs the industry continues to grow and mature, we believe that over time, there will be no 'impact' investing \u2014 it will simply be investing,\u201d says Michael Tiedemann, CEO/CIO of Tiedemann Advisors.\n\nHuman Rights Is Leading The Way\n\nSo, where are people putting their money? Human rights was the most popular cause category for investors, followed by the environment and diversity, according to the survey. Millennials favored environmental impact and human rights, women tended to opt for gender equality, while men leaned toward diversity. Nearly half of millennials \u2014 47 percent \u2014 felt so strongly about impact investing they said they would move their brokerage account to gain broader access to socially responsible investments.\n\nOf course these conscious choices aren\u2019t just impacting portfolios \u2014 publicly traded companies are starting to realize that it\u2019s good for their business to give a more critical look at which suppliers they\u2019re using, or how much of an environmental impact their operations may make. \u201cIn some cases, companies are changing their behavior, and you can give investors the credit for the rapid momentum of those changes,\u201d Demmissie says.\n\nA Contributing Factor in the Disappearance of Straws\n\nCompanies seeking to ensure long-term success may need to take a hard look at some of their policies, says Jordan Farris, Head of ETF Product Development at investment services firm Nuveen. \u201cStarbucks is a good example of a company adjusting its business model,\u201d he says. \u201cAs concern regarding the increase in ocean plastic has grown, Starbucks has made the decision to eliminate single-use plastic straws by 2020.\u201d\n\nFor investors looking to ensure their money supports the \u201cbest\u201d companies, Farris cautions that the definition of what makes a company responsible can vary widely. Overall, it\u2019s any company that is incorporating \u201cpositive environmental, social and governance practices into its core business model,\u201d he says. But investors can also have an impact simply by choosing not to invest in companies that are involved in major controversies, that pollute, or that manufacture tobacco or firearms, etc.\n\nHow Do You Do Well By Doing Good?\n\nInvestors looking to do their due diligence on a company before they invest need look no further than the internet, explains Nick Kovacevich, CEO of KushCo Holdings, the parent company of several cannabis industry firms. \u201cInformation is so ever-present today, and it\u2019s not difficult for someone to do 30 minutes of research on a company and come to a determination if they are socially and environmentally conscious.\u201d\n\nIf millennials have proven nothing else over the last decade, it\u2019s that they\u2019re willing to push boundaries, even when \u2014 perhaps especially when \u2014 it means a break with convention, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing with impact investing, Tiedemann explains. \u201cThey\u2019re questioning the traditional view of making investments to create wealth, and then once they've made money, donating it to their charity of choice.\u201d They\u2019ve decided they want to get the double investment benefit of a social and a financial return, and they\u2019re demanding that the marketplace provide it.\n\nAnd while it may be the millennials leading this charge now, they\u2019re really just the thin end of the wedge, Kovacevich says. \u201cMillennials are going to teach their children the same ethics and values that they have,\u201d he says, and the impact investment train is only going to build momentum as it chugs along. Tomorrow\u2019s companies will either choose to hop aboard, or find themselves left at the station.\n\nWith Kathryn Tuggle\n\nHOW TO SAVE MORE MONEY\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By James Rainey\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Belated warnings from public officials and the reluctance of residents who had survived previous fires to leave home were among the factors that contributed to the delayed and chaotic evacuation in what has become the deadliest wildfire in California history, survivors said.\n\nSome of those who escaped from the massive Camp Fire last week questioned why Butte County leaders did not do more to warn residents of Paradise and neighboring mountain communities as a fire whipped with fearsome speed through the mountainous region north of Sacramento.\n\nMost of the attention following the wildfire has focused on the search for dozens of people still missing and the possibility that power equipment belonging to the electric utility PG&E may have sparked the fire. But a few residents have begun to ask why notice did not get out to more people about the fire, which has killed 48 and destroyed an estimated 7,600 single-family homes, both records for California.\n\nWe were trying to move tens of thousands of people out of an area very rapidly with the fire coming very rapidly. And no matter what your plan is to do that, no plan will ever work 100 percent when you are dealing with that much chaos.\"\n\n\"They definitely didn't do enough,\" said Christina Taft, whose 67-year-old mother has been missing since the fire. \"She didn't expect it to be that bad. She expected someone would be calling, or something, if it got bad. But they didn't.\"\n\n\"They were negligent. They just let them go,\" said Taft, who has had no word from her mother, Victoria, since last Thursday. \"There is a reason all these people are dead.\"\n\nA resident of Magalia, about 8 miles west of the fire\u2019s starting point, confronted Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea and other officials Monday about why he and his neighbors could not find any information about the dangerous blaze, a full three hours after fire crews first responded to the ignition point, near Highway 70 in Plumas National Forest.\n\n\u201cWe use the emergency broadcast system for a tornado warning. But this is a deadly fire,\u201d said the man, who was not identified by county officials whom he addressed at the meeting in Oroville. \u201cI don\u2019t remember any alert coming over my radio. ... People in the community are freaking out, you need to get some information up here.\u201d\n\nThe Butte County sheriff's office said it did deliver notifications about the fire danger: 5,227 by email, 25,643 via phone (to both land lines and cellular devices) and 5,445 by text message.\n\n\"I wish we had the opportunity to get more alerts out, more of a warning out, but unfortunately we didn\u2019t,\" Sheriff Honea told the public meeting on Monday.\n\nAt a news conference Tuesday evening, Honea stressed that the fire\u2019s unusually swift progress south and west into Magalia, Paradise and other mountain communities made timely notification difficult.\n\n\"You have to keep in mind that this was an extraordinarily chaotic and rapidly moving situation. The fire started in a remote area. It takes awhile for our fire resources to get there and from that point, trying to determine the path of travel and whether or not that\u2019s going to effect populated areas, that takes time,\" Honea said.\n\nHe added that it's possible some people were warned and didn't immediately act to get out of harm's way. \"We were trying to move tens of thousands of people out of an area very rapidly with the fire coming very rapidly. And no matter what your plan is to do that, no plan will ever work 100 percent when you are dealing with that much chaos.\"\n\nHonea, who took office four years ago, also suggested that emergency officials have to be concerned not to over-burden people with excessive or unneeded evacuation orders. He said the region had already lived through evacuations from earlier fires and last year\u2019s threatened collapse of the Oroville Dam, which caused nearly 200,000 people to flee.\n\n\u201cSo that takes a toll on people,\u201d Honea said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ever get into situation where people begin to stop paying attention because they feel like we are ordering evacuations for no cause or for very little cause.\u201d\n\nLike other counties, Butte has a system that allows residents to sign up for \u201creverse 911\u201d telephone alerts in times of emergency.\n\nSavannah Rauscher told The Sacramento Bee that by the time she got the 911 alert at 8:30 a.m., embers and dust were already flying around her family\u2019s Edgewood Lane home.\n\n\"We saw a wall of fire,\" she told the newspaper. \"Trees were glowing 50 yards away and it was probably moving like 10 yards every couple minutes. ... I had no idea it could be that fast.\"\n\nRausher and her husband soon found themselves in a long and unmoving line of cars. Her husband pulled into what normally would have been the oncoming traffic lane to escape, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to die like this.\u201d Rausher said she waved other cars to follow along to safety.\n\nHigh on the ridges above the Sacramento Valley, many homes do not have easy cellphone service, or access to WiFi. It\u2019s unknown how much that isolation may have prevented residents from getting word of the fire.\n\nRisa Johnson, a reporter for The Chico Enterprise-Record, said people in her newsroom also wondered how many residents might not sign up for the reverse 911 warnings because of concern about giving the government their personal information. The Sierra Nevada foothills are home to some who moved there precisely because they wanted to get away from intrusion by public officials.\n\nBut even signing up for the warnings was no guarantee they came through. Johnson said her aunt, Peg, applied for the 911 alerts, but received no notice at her Paradise home of the Camp Fire. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t get anything,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was friends and family calling, or neighbors coming by. That\u2019s how many people found out.\u201d\n\nTaft said she argued fiercely with her mother for more than an hour, trying to convince her to flee. But there were no sheriff\u2019s deputies demanding the neighborhood evacuate. Fire crews, busy on the front lines of the blaze, did not stop by. No one she talked to in her neighborhood was ordered out.\n\nShe said that when she reluctantly left her mother, the elder Taft was on the phone, talking to another elderly woman, both of them persuaded this fire would pass by, like all the others.\n\n\"Seniors expect an authority to tell them to leave,\" said Christina Taft, a business student at California State University, Chico. \"And they did not get the authorities to tell them this time.\"\n\nSheriff Honea was greeted warmly by much of the crowd at Monday's public hearing. And some fire victims said it was wrong to blame the government for the fire's toll.\n\n\"This was an act of God, if you asked me,\" said Bill Husa, 55, a long-time photographer for the Chico Enterprise Record. \"None of these officials have control over 50-mile-an-hour winds and a raging wildland fire. There is no way they had time to get everyone notified.\"\n\nQuestions about emergency notifications are becoming a more routine reality for emergency management officials nationwide, given storms, floods and wildfires made more potent as a result of global warming, said Rob Lewin, director of the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management.\n\n\"Nationwide we are all feeling the trauma of climate change and the number of disasters we are facing over and over again,\" said Lewin. \"We have to build an emergency management system that is ready to handle the new situation we are dealing with.\"\n\nAfter firestorms last year devastated broad swaths of Sonoma and Napa counties and blackened a record number of acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, many people reported they did not receive emergency warnings.\n\nPatients were being evacuated from the Feather River Hospital as it burned down during the Camp Fire in Paradise on Nov. 8. Josh Edelson / AFP - Getty Images\n\nLewin said his county has beefed up its notification system as a result \u2014 sending word of evacuations over land lines, cellphones, social media and traditional news outlets. Still, the system is not foolproof. Just 12 percent of the county's residents have signed up to receive so-called reverse 911 notifications in emergencies, despite last year's fires and a subsequent debris flow that killed 21 people. Even a system designed to push warnings to all cellphones, tested recently by the Trump administration, did not reach everyone.\n\nLewin said he had two cellphones side by side during that test, both serviced by the same phone company, and only one received the emergency alert. \"And we don't know the reason why,\" he said.\n\nAn exacerbating factor in Butte County may have been the advanced age of many residents. Paradise and its environs are popular with retirees, some of whom are reluctant to leave home because of mobility problems. Feather River Hospital had to rely on private cars and trucks to get out many of its patients, just ahead of the flames.\n\nCourtney Wright, a medical assistant, said her 54-year-old father was not compelled to leave his Magalia home even as the threat seemed to escalate. \"We have had so many fires up there that it's kind of like it's nothing,\" said Wright. \"It's just on to the next.\" When the house behind his caught on fire, its propane tank exploding, Wright's father finally decided it was time to move on.\n\nResidents did not find an easy path to safety. The narrow mountain roads out of the communities quickly jammed, forcing some people to leave their cars and run for their lives. The incinerated corpses of others, still in their cars, provided ample evidence that the alarm wasn't raised in time.\n\nAs Honea was pressed for more answers at Monday\u2019s meeting, he acknowledged that thoughts of those who could not escape troubled him. \u201cI understand it was absolutely chaotic,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cI will probably never be able to give you an answer that satisfies you.\u201d", "Oprah interviews former first lady Michelle Obama copied!\n\nTo kick off her book tour, former first lady Michelle Obama was interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in Chicago.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nThe number of infections carried by ticks has hit a record high in the United States, according to a new report.\n\nNearly 60,000 people were diagnosed with a tickborne infection, mostly Lyme disease, in 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. And that\u2019s almost certainly just a fraction of the true count.\n\n\u201cThe true number of cases is probably 10 times that,\u201d said Dr. John Aucott, director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Research Center and chair of the federal Tick-Borne Disease Working Group.\n\nThe working group issued a report Wednesday saying states and the federal government need to spend more to track, prevent and treat these infections as they affect more and more people.\n\n\u201cThere are more cases. Every year, the geographic distribution expands,\u201d Aucott told NBC News.\n\nCongress told the Health and Human Services Department to set up the working group as part of the 2016 21st Century Cures Act. This is the group\u2019s first report.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that ticks are infecting more people as the bugs themselves spread, Aucott said. It\u2019s also clear that much more work is needed to keep track of these infections and to help people suffering from them.\n\n\u201cThere are so many questions out there that haven\u2019t been answered,\u201d Aucott said.\n\n\u201cWe heard comments from hundreds and hundreds of patients. It is obvious that this is a real problem, that people are really suffering.\u201d\n\nThe CDC said it\u2019s not entirely clear why the number of reported cases is on the rise. \u201cA number of factors can affect tick numbers each year, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, and host populations such as mice and other animals,\u201d the agency said in its report on the number of new cases.\n\n\u201cTick densities in any year vary by region, state, and county. Numbers of reported tickborne disease cases are also affected by healthcare provider awareness, testing, and reporting practices. Finally, during any given year, people may or may not notice changes in tick populations depending on the amount of time they or their pets spend outdoors.\u201d\n\nLyme disease infected 42,743 people in 2017, the CDC said. That compares to 36,000 cases in 2016.\n\nOther diseases commonly spread by ticks include: Ehrlichiosis, spread by the Lone Star tick, which affected 7,700 people last year; Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which affected 6,200 people; babesiosis, which affected 2,300; tularemia, which affected 239 people and Powassan virus, which affected 33.\n\nLyme is by far the most common tickborne infection and most cases probably are not even ever diagnosed. It likely infects 300,000 people a year, the working group said. \u201cThe number of U.S. counties now considered to be of high incidence for Lyme disease has increased by more than 300 percent in the Northeastern states and by approximately 250 percent in the North-Central states,\u201d the report reads.\n\nTests for Lyme are not very good, the report notes. \u201cThis leaves physicians without the tools needed to diagnose; and without an accurate diagnosis, it is challenging for physicians to provide early treatment,\u2019 the report said.\n\n\u201cPersistent symptoms after treatment of Lyme disease can be severe, yet their cause(s) remains unknown and debated. There are currently no uniformly accepted or validated treatment options for patients with these chronic symptoms.\u201d\n\nThis big gap in knowledge makes it possible for people to argue about how to treat patients, Aucott said. \u201cOne of the sticking points was how to even name it,\u201d he said.\n\nPatients with what they describe as chronic Lyme disease have been critical of medical groups such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which are skeptical of the idea that long-term antibiotic treatment can cure people of their symptoms.\n\n\u201cIf we knew more, maybe these controversies would go away,\u201d Aucott said.\n\n\u201cAmericans need help, yet progress has been hampered by a lack of attention at the federal level and by divisions within the field,\u201d the report says.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Chop Suey, an oil on canvas painted in 1929, is believed by experts to be inspired by Chinese restaurants Hopper visited, both in New York and on his travels.\n\nIt was considered the greatest Hopper in private hands.\n\nA uniquely American place in the early 20th century, the chop suey joint personified the spirit of the modern melting pot. Hopper\u2019s painting portrays two women in conversation and, according to some art scholars, one striking detail is that its female subject is facing her doppelg\u00e4nger. While they are seated across from each other, they don't appear to be talking to each other. The brilliant effects of light on the canvas are uniquely Hopper.\n\nWillem de Kooning's \"Woman as Landscape\" Christie's\n\nA Willem de Kooning work, his tour de force, \u201cWoman as Landscape,\u201d set a record for the artist, selling for $68,937,500.\n\nOther artists setting records included Alexander Calder, for his standing sculpture woodwork, \u201cHen,\u201d which sold for $8,412,500,\n\nOther records went to artists Arshile Gorky, Francis Criss, Joseph Stella and George Tooker, for his \u201cA Game of Chess,\u201d which sold for $432,000. All the evening\u2019s sales were to anonymous buyers.\n\nMarc Porter, Christie's chairman, said Tuesday's auction was special for its irony. The reason Barney Ebsworth began collecting American paintings was because he was told European paintings were too expensive. Ebsworth\u2019s collection ended up as one of the top five collections ever sold at auction.\n\n\"There has been a groundswell of interest in American Modernism. One of the most interesting of this collection is that it explored all elements of American painting and sculpture in the 20th century from magic realism to abstract expressionism and beyond,\" Porter said.\n\nEighty percent of the works sold went to American buyers, according to Christie\u2019s. Porter said despite the high prices the market isn't overheated, \"it's exactly the right temperature.\"\n\nEric Widing, deputy chairman of Christie's, knew Ebsworth for decades. \"He was passionate about art, he was a student, he knew artists in depth. He bought low at times and he also bought high at times and sold high as we saw tonight,\" Widing said.\n\nA statement from the Ebsworth family read: \"We are delighted with the results tonight at Christie's which paid tribute to my father\u2019s eye and focused on quality. The works that gave him so much pleasure will now do the same for their new owners.\"\n\nEbsworth purchased a small travel company in 1959, which would grow into INTRAV, an international travel company. As an early pioneer in the cruise industry he founded and was chairman for Royal Cruise Line and Clipper Cruise Line. Ebsworth was named one of the World's 200 Greatest Collectors by Art News Magazine in 2012.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 14, 2018, 8:56 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the first name of the private collector whose paintings were sold at Christie\u2019s.

Clark Jr. with transportation of a firearm across state lines and possession of illegal, high capacity magazines intended for use with AR-15 weapons.\n\nThe case against Clark Jr., 30, was filed Friday but unsealed Tuesday. The Metropolitan Police Department assisted in the arrest in the Bloomingdale neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and described Clark in its public incident report as a \"white supremacist\" involved in a \"suspected hate crime\" investigation.\n\nThe FBI affidavit, filed in support of the U.S. Attorney's criminal complaint, alleges that two family members called the FBI after becoming concerned about Clark's behavior, which they described as \"really riled up\" and \"agitated.\"\n\nThey believed he was \"heavily involved\" in the alt-right movement, according to the FBI.\n\nAgents said that Clark and his younger brother attended the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year. The gathering of white nationalists and alt-right supporters ended in one death and much violence.\n\nFamily members told the FBI they believe the brothers had photos from the event with James Alex Fields, the man prosecutors say drove a car into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring 19 other protesters, the filing states.\n\nThe witnesses also told agents that the pair \"admired\" Timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski, and Charles Manson,\" the affidavit staes. The two believed a race war was coming, \"and they wanted to expedite it,\" according to the FBI's account of what relatives said.\n\nThe bureau alleged that Clark once said he and his late brother fantasized about killing \"Jews and blacks.\"\n\nAdditionally, the FBI stated, Clark's adult younger brother committed suicide within three hours of the synagogue attack, which claimed the lives of 11 worshipers. After his sibling's death Clark told family members he believed Bowers was a friend on conservative social media platform Gab, according to the filing.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Bowers was a self-proclaimed white supremacist upset that a Jewish organization, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, or HIAS, has long supported Central American refugees.\n\nThe violence came at the height of President Donald Trump's midterm election campaigning, during which he often raised the specter of an \"invasion\" of Central Americans participating in a migrant caravan headed for the southern border.\n\nThe legal document lists what prosecutors say are some of Clark's postings and musings, including a Gab rant that stated the victims of the synagogue attack, which federal prosecutors allege was a hate crime, \"were all active supporters of pedophilia \u2026 and every last one of them deserved exactly what happened to them and so much worse.\"\n\nClark said that the synagogue violence was justified because, he believed, \"a homosexual Jewish couple was having an adopted baby circumcised that week,\" according to the court filing.\n\nHe called Bowers a \"hero,\" according to the FBI.\n\nClark's family thought he was smoking marijuana and possibly methamphetamine. On Gab, the Washington resident described himself as a \"Meth-Smoking, Pipe Bomb making, mailman-murding,#Fed,#DemoKKKrat, Che Guevara of the altright,\" according to the affidavit.\n\nConcerned that he could be a danger to himself or others, the family members made a failed attempt to take Clark's firearms sometime before alerting authorities, the filing said.\n\nDuring a search of Clark's home Friday, agents seized a shotgun, a rifle and a handgun \u2014 all registered to Clark and his brother \u2014 as well as an unregistered Colt .38 Special that a relative handed over, according to the allegations.\n\n\"In addition,\" the FBI affidavit states, \"agents recovered four high-capacity AR-15 magazines capable of holding up to 30 rounds of ammunition.\"\n\nWashington, D.C. outlawed such magazines.\n\nClark lives in Washington with his father and sister, the affidavit states.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Benjy Sarlin\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Indivisible, the grassroots movement at the center of opposition to President Donald Trump, taught its activists how to influence lawmakers from outside of power with an online guide in late 2016 based on the tea party's tactics under Barack Obama.\n\nNow the \"resistance\" group is looking to prepare its members for life under divided government.\n\nIndivisible's approach two years ago went viral, local chapters popped up around the country and its members helped fuel a Democratic takeover of the House in the midterms. The updated sequel, a guide to \"Indivisible On Offense,\" looks to instruct progressive members on the power that comes with Democratic control of the House and how they can maximize it.\n\n\"I was calling Indivisible leaders around the country to thank them this week and the dominant theme was 'Okay, but what are we doing next?'\" Leah Greenberg, a co-founder of Indivisible, told NBC News at a gathering in Washington for newly elected progressives.\n\nThe the new guide includes detailed advice on pressuring members to investigate Trump, but also on how to potentially confront Democratic leaders to secure concessions in what Indivisible calls \"must-pass bills.\"\n\n\"A small group of progressives willing to vote no on must-pass bills that Democratic leadership needs to pass gives them leverage, if they're willing to use it,\" the authors write.\n\nIn a preview of how the emboldened grassroots wing might operate, Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., joined climate protesters in occupying Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office on Tuesday. The two exchanged kind words on Twitter, but Ocasio-Cortez's demands were more than symbolic: She pushed for a plan to combat climate change by 2020 drafted without input from Democrats who take donations from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, congresswoman-elect from New York, speaks to activists with the Sunrise Movement protesting in the offices of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on Capitol Hill on Nov. 13, 2018. Sarah Silbiger / The New York Times - Redux Pictures\n\nIndivisible's goal, according to the book, is to \"pave the way to the post-Trump era\" both by stymieing the Republican agenda and by laying the groundwork for a more robust progressive platform if they defeat Trump in 2020.\n\n\"In 2017, they organized against Trumpcare, they made the Republican tax scam a liability,\" Ezra Levin, a co-founder of Indivisible, said in an interview. \"In 2018, they registered voters, endorsed candidates and got out the vote. In 2019, they're going to be holding those same representatives accountable.\"\n\nThe tea party movement and its legislative bastion, the House Freedom Caucus, again figure prominently in the guide. The hope is to replicate their success in influencing legislation while avoiding some of the movement's stumbles after their own wave election in 2010.\n\nPart of that approach could mean standing up to Democratic leaders, but it also means managing expectations. The tea party frequently battled Republican leadership, sometimes forcing them to negotiate with Democrat members on spending bills, in part because activists became convinced they could repeal Obamacare with a Democratic president and Senate. Those tensions peaked in 2013 when conservatives forced a government shutdown in an unsuccessful attempt to defund the Democratic health law.\n\nThe new guidebook doesn't dwell on how high activists should aim, but it devotes a lot of space to distinctions between \"messaging bills,\" which are designed to build support for future policy goals and put Republicans on record opposing them, and must-pass bills like spending legislation, where members can withhold votes to force more modest policy changes.\n\n\"We talk to people realistically about what's going on, what we think is possible now, and what we think will take time to accomplish, and that's a core philosophy that animates the guide,\" Greenberg said.\n\nThere's plenty of material on the Democrats' new power to investigate the White House through subpoenas and hearings, which leaders say is likely to be a big driver of activist engagement. The authors write that members should \"demand nothing less than Democrats using their oversight authority on Day One to obtain Trump\u2019s tax returns,\" while also pressuring lawmakers to investigate potential cabinet-level scandals in the relevant committees.\n\nOnce again, there are some notes of caution, with a section on impeachment warning that it's likely out of bounds unless Trump's political support collapses and investigations producer stronger evidence. While the guide says Indivisible supports opening impeachment proceedings on principle, it adds \"we also recognize that impeachment is not a matter of whether someone objectively deserves to be impeached; it's a matter of whether the votes are there.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Honea said that he's requested 100 National Guard troops to work in conjunction with those searching for human remains in the fire, which as of Tuesday night has burned around 130,000 acres and was 35 percent contained.\n\n\"We want to be able to cover as much ground as quickly as we possibly can,\" Honea said, adding that even after a search is done and people are allowed to return to the community, it\u2019s possible more remains may be found.\n\n\"I know that that's a very difficult thing to think about, but that's the difficult situation that we find ourselves in today,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Camp Fire is one of two deadly wildfires burning at opposite ends of California.\n\nIn Southern California near Los Angeles, the Woolsey Fire that broke out Thursday afternoon has killed two people near Malibu, burned more than 97,100 acres \u2014 an area around the size of the city of Denver \u2014 and destroyed an estimated at least 435 homes and other structures. A fire official said the number of destroyed structures is expected to rise significantly as assessments are done. The fire was 40 percent contained Tuesday night.\n\nThe Camp Fire broke out at around 6:33 a.m. on Thursday in Butte County, north of Sacramento, according to officials. An estimated 7,600 single-family homes and 260 commercial structures have been destroyed, and the town of Paradise, population around 26,000, was devastated by the blaze.\n\nThe Camp Fire is the deadliest in state history, surpassing the 1933 Griffith Park Fire that killed 29 people, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.\n\nAs the fire overtook Paradise as people were evacuating Thursday, Cal Fire Division Chief David Hawks, who is also the fire chief for the town, saw one of two ambulances transporting patients from a hospital to safety catch fire, and directed everyone inside that vehicle and in another ambulance to a cul-de-sac.\n\nWith embers raining down in what Hawks likened to snowflakes in a blizzard, they sought shelter in a house and prepared to ride it out. One of the four paramedics was able to get in the home\u2019s garage through a doggie door and unlock the door, and the four patients were moved inside, he said. There were also three nurses.\n\n\"What I told everyone: \u2018We\u2019re going to ride the fire out here and we need to protect this home,\u2019 Hawks said Tuesday. \"You know, this is our Fort Knox, basically.\"\n\nParamedics began clearing pine needles from around the home and from the gutter of the roof. If the house ended up catching fire, Hawk said they were prepared to enter the cul-de-sac which was an open area to ride out the fire.\n\n\"A couple of them were on phones with family members, talking with family members and what have you. And basically they asked me if I thought they were going to die here, or one of them did,\u201d Hawks recalled.\n\n\"And I told them, I don\u2019t believe that we are going to die here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very serious situation but I think if we follow my direction, we\u2019ll ride the fire out here.\"\n\nThey were joined by two members of search and rescue teams, who also took shelter in the house. The road eventually cleared enough for those seeking shelter to make it back to Feather River Hospital, which although was near flames also had a large parking lot which would have been a better place to shelter until they could escape the town.\n\nHawks, who joined Cal Fire right out of high school in 1984, said he doesn\u2019t consider his actions exceptional.\n\n\"I was doing my job,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of lives saved by a lot of people that day \u2014 not only myself, but by a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThree of the dead in the Camp Fire have been identified and the next of kin notified, the Butte County Sheriff\u2019s Department said. They are: Ernest Foss, 65, of Paradise; Jesus Fernandez, 48, of Concow; and Carl Wiley, 77, of Magalia.\n\nThere have also been several arrests for suspected looting in the evacuation zone, Honea said.\n\nTwo men were arrested on Monday inside a home in Butte Creek Canyon, one of whom had a handgun registered to a home under evacuation in Paradise; two men were arrested Tuesday in an area under evacuation and they allegedly had a laptop that didn\u2019t belong to them; and a man and a woman were arrested in a stolen motorhome in Chico on Tuesday, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nWhile the Woolsey Fire is still burning, officials said the tide is turning.\n\n\"The risk has diminished significantly,\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby told reporters midday in Thousand Oaks. \"When you think about this fire several days ago, it burned from Bell Canyon to the ocean which is approximately 30 miles. So our firefighters have gotten the upper hand.\u201d\n\nAnother fire burning in Southern California, the Hill Fire in Ventura County, was 90 percent contained Tuesday after burning more than 4,500 acres since it broke out on Thursday, according to Cal Fire.

When seeking other sources of funding to finance their business growth, many owners either avoid taking on debt or are unable to meet the requirements to get a business loan.\n\nIn order to overcome the financial barriers, Latino business owners disproportionately rely on their credit cards and other financial methods to increase cash flow, including some that come with high interest rates but require less collateral.\n\nLatinos who take out a business loan are much more likely than non-Latino white business owners to use personal guarantees such as cash, real estate, and other assets to secure the loan. On average, Latinos have low credit scores or limited credit histories, hurting their chances of getting a business loan approved.\n\nRegardless of ethnicity, small business owners reported greater success at small banks when getting approved for a loan, line of credit or a cash advance.\n\n\u201cThis pattern appears to be even more pronounced for Latino-owned businesses, with 60 percent of applicants reporting credit success at small banks, compared to 34 percent of applicants at large banks,\u201d the report reads.\n\nJoel S\u00e1nchez, president of Premier Cleaning, a janitorial services company in Dallas and Tony Batista, president of Floors2Luv, a construction company in Houston, are part of that 60 percent.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, who was interviewed for the report alongside Batista, has a line of credit that was approved by a small, local bank that helped him finance his company\u2019s payroll needs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very accessible, more personal, something that I can trust,\u201d S\u00e1nchez stated in the report. He said he has a good, working relationship with the small bank.\n\nIn Batista\u2019s case, several large banks denied his attempt to refinance the mortgage on the building where he operates his business. But he got the refinancing after developing a relationship with a small bank.\n\nThe study recommended replicating S\u00e1nchez and Batista\u2019s experience nationwide.\n\nFor the most part, Latino business owners tend to be much younger than non-Latino business owners and they are outpacing other demographic groups when it comes to starting new businesses, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThat, in turn, matters as Latinos are the fastest growing demographic in our nation and Latino-owned businesses are growing in number and importance,\u201d Gutt said. \u201cOn top of that, the Latino population is among the youngest of all demographic groups and its entrepreneurial class is equally young.\u201d\n\nEntrepreneurs and business owners featured in the report emphasized a need for more, stronger business networks to share each others' experiences taking advantage of available business support programs and to foster mentoring opportunities with Latinos running successful businesses in cities such as Miami, Chicago and San Diego.\n\nThe report said the networks and mentoring could help close the business knowledge gap that some owners reported in the study, while fostering a new generation of more financially knowledgeable Latino business owners.\n\nAlthough the report did not include recommendations for large banks, the authors said they plan another study on how to get large banks to lend more to Latino business owners and create partnerships for them with financial technology providers such as PayPal.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Four girls fight through cancer with friendship copied!\n\nA few months ago, Lauren, Chloe, Ava, and McKinley posed for a now-viral photo to mark their remission.

A lot of this is due to the tireless standard-bearer of this cultural revolution, Marvel Comics, and its colorful chairman emeritus, Stan Lee. Lee, who passed away this week at the age of 95, is rightly credited as a comics visionary. But he was also devious and problematic, qualities mostly hidden by his talent for self-promotion. While complicated, however, Lee inarguably changed the face of our entertainment landscape, both in the niche world of comics and in the mainstream world of movie and television entertainment.\n\nBorn in 1922, Lee spent his life in the comic and magazine world, but his breakthrough didn\u2019t come until the 1960s, when he was already nearly 40 years old. It was then that, along with the late Jack Kirby, Lee co-created \u201cThe Fantastic Four.\u201d Together, Lee and Kirby would go on to create many comic titles still popular today, including \u201cThe X-Men,\u201d \u201cIron Man,\u201d \u201cHulk\u201d and \u201cThor.\u201d Lee also collaborated with comic artists like Bill Everett and Steve Ditko \u2014 Lee and Ditko created what is arguably Marvels\u2019 most popular character, \u201cSpider-Man.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s biggest achievement wasn\u2019t so much the comic characters themselves as it was the concept of fandom.\n\nBut Lee\u2019s biggest achievement wasn\u2019t so much the comic characters themselves as it was the concept of fandom. He put out regular newsletters (called the Marvel Bullpen Bulletin) advertising what stories and characters the publishing house was working on. He created an entirely new way of crediting comic artists, known today as \u201cthe Marvel method,\u201d that promoted the writers and creators. He pushed the boundaries for what his writers could talk about in their stories. In fact, his refusal to tone down frank depictions of drug addiction ultimately forced the strict Comics Code Authority to update its standards, allowing more comic books to include adult themes in their stories.\n\nLee did much to promote comics; he also used comics to promote himself. While often associated with the birth of Marvel, for example, Lee did not create the franchise \u2014 that was Martin Goodman. Lee exploited his \u201cMarvel method,\u201d where anyone who added the smallest amount to a project would be listed as part of the team who created it, to give himself credit for stories he barely worked on.\n\nMoreover, as Lee rose in the company from writer to editor to editor-in-chief and finally publisher, he did so at the expense of those he once collaborated with. Ditko left Marvel in 1966 without explanation, but most assume it was over the rights to Spider-Man, something Lee for a while insisted was his creation alone. (Lee eventually backtracked on that claim.) Kirby stayed on for decades, still writing and drawing long after Lee stopped. But by the late 1980s he had become embittered and angry over the raw deal he got. Kirby referred to Marvel as a group of \u201cthugs\u201d who screwed him out of royalties for his creations, while Lee was making millions playing what was perhaps his best character creation: Marvel\u2019s \"Stan the Man.\u201d\n\nLee was also a problematic figure when it came to diversity. Like many men of his era, he talked the talk, overseeing the creations of characters like Black Panther and Luke Cage in the 1960s and 1970s, and regularly used his Marvel soapbox to comment on social issues like racial bigotry. But walking the walk was harder. As late as 2015, he still insisted Spider-Man films should only cast the character as straight, white and male, because that\u2019s the way Lee imagined him. The idea that his characters could be recast or reimagined as women, or as people of color, didn\u2019t sit well with him.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Marvel has struggled to find a female superhero to match DC Comics\u2019 Wonder Woman, and it\u2019s a simple one.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Marvel has struggled to find a female superhero to match DC Comics\u2019 Wonder Woman, and it\u2019s a simple one: There aren\u2019t any. Lee never took female superheroes seriously, thinking them more suited for Playboy than Marvel \u2018s imprint. Look at his vision for Jessica Jones, for instance, who was originally a far bubblier and feminine character than the version portrayed on Netflix. Captain Marvel, who is being played by Brie Larson in the upcoming blockbuster, was a man during Lee\u2019s time as editor and was only gender-flipped decades later. (There are also some dark but unresolved allegations about Lee\u2019s real-life behavior, including that he abused employees and groped nurses in his final decade of life.)\n\nBut despite a messy history, Stan Lee\u2019s idea of putting his comics on the big and small screen inarguably changed the entertainment landscape in radical ways. Marvel\u2019s decision to lean into Lee and Kirby\u2019s interconnected universe concept \u2014 best exemplified by \u201cThe Avengers\u201d \u2014 played a huge role in this impact. Before \u201cThe Avengers,\u201d there were stand-alone superhero trilogies than focused on one character or set of characters. After \u201cThe Avengers,\u201d though, it seemed like every tentpole franchise, both superhero and otherwise, was trying to figure out how to create crossover stoylines.\n\nLee also laid the groundwork for the sort of online interactions between consumer and artist that fans take for granted today. His comic book creations, even if they were not his alone, came down from their pedestals to show human and relatable sides; many of Lee\u2019s superheroes were portrayed as flawed people who just wanted to do the right thing, not demigods. This in turn enabled a film like \u201cIron Man\u201d to flourish, even as two-dimensional idealists like Superman are having a harder time getting off the ground.\n\nLee may have been mortal, but his ideas, like his superheroes, will never die.", "Monica Lewinsky speaking out on Clinton impeachment trial 20 years later copied!\n\nIn a docu-series airing on A&E, Lewinsky describes her encounters with President Bill Clinton and discusses the day FBI agents questioned her in more detail than she ever has.\n\nRead More", "Photographer behind photo appearing to show students giving Nazi salute speaks out copied!\n\nPeter Gust says the photo taken at a high school prom was taken out of context, claiming the students were waving goodbye to their parents.\n\nRead More", "Search continues in Mexico for missing North Carolina teacher copied!\n\nSpanish teacher Patrick Braxton-Andrew was last seen two weeks ago in Urique, a small village popular with hikers.

Even if the decision to part ways is clearly the best (or only) one, the resulting separation can be traumatizing for children. Research shows that the best way to avoid risking the well-being of kids going through this difficult process, is to keep it as low-conflict and amicable as possible.\n\nHow do you do that? For some divorcing or divorced parents, the answer is \u2018nesting\u2019 (also called 'birdnesting'). This means to keep the family residence intact as a home where both parents rotate living with their children, while otherwise dwelling in separate residences.\n\nOne apartment in rotation, and the family home for all stays with kids\n\nSherri Sharma, partner at Aronson, Mayefsky & Sloan, LLP, a matrimonial law firm in NYC typically sees divorcing parents who take a nesting approach by keeping the main house and then sharing a separate apartment, which they individually occupy when not \u201cat home\u201d with the children.\n\n\u201cThe way I've seen nesting done is not people having three homes, as most people, even quite wealthy clients, don't find that feasible,\u201d Sharma tells NBC News BETTER. \u201cUsually the parents have a studio apartment they share and rotate, and then keep the marital home where the children stay put.\u201d\n\nThe motivating concept behind nesting, as Sharma puts it, is \u201cthere's little disruption for the kids. They're not being affected [environmentally] by the fact that their parents are separating.\u201d\n\nShort-term nesting is the healthiest way to do it\n\nSharma has seen nesting work out well for clients who are parting amicably, but only if it\u2019s done in the short-term.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen \u2018nesting\u2019 go on forever,\u201d says Sharma. \u201cA few months is okay but for longer periods (beyond six months), I think the uncertainty of not knowing what it will really be like to have separate homes can be confusing or anxiety-[inducing] for children.\u201d\n\nDr. Fran Walfish, a family and relationship psychotherapist and the author of \u201cThe Self-Aware Parent: Resolving Conflict and Building a Better Bond with Your Child\u201d concurs with Sharma on a short-term nesting plan, and actually finds this method to be beneficial to children. She caps it at three months.\n\n\u2018The shock of the painful news to the children is softened by a brief transitional period in which the kids\u2019 environmental surroundings remain the same and the only change is the presence of one parent or the other, versus both [parents] at the same time,\u201d says Walfish. \u201cAny longer than a period of three months of nesting risks giving your children an inaccurate message that [the parents] are working on reconciliation. All children of divorce fantasize and wish for their parents to work things out and return to being a complete family unit.\u201d\n\nSome of the biggest perks are practical\n\nCeleste Viciere, a licensed mental health clinician finds that nesting can benefit children both socially, and when it comes to practical everyday stuff.\n\n\u201cHaving the children live in the same house that is familiar to them can be beneficial because it's easier to stay in the same school and keep the same friend group. Often when kids have to bounce between different households, it tends to affect their social lives due to the location,\u201d says Viciere. \u201cAnother upside to nesting is that kids don't have to lug their belongings back and forth between two places. It allows the kids to come to terms with the divorce without being separated from the environment they have always known.\u201d\n\nBut Viciere, too, sees the downsides of nesting.\n\n\u201c[Nesting] may feel confusing to a child,\u201d she says, echoing Walfish\u2019s concerns. \u201cChildren may struggle with having amazing family memories in the house but feel unable to share them together anymore. It could also lead to a false sense of reality where they become hopeful that their parents could get back together.\u201d\n\nTo make it work, parents need to be on the best terms\n\nShelley A. Senterfitt, a family lawyer-turned-therapist specializing in family law issues and relationships, does not recommend nesting as she finds that it can create opportunity for the very kind of conflict divorcing parents are trying to avoid.\n\nSenterfitt offers the following hypothetical conflict that could arise: \u201cImagine if it\u2019s mom\u2019s week with the kids in the marital residence. She decides to make a big pot of chili and uses the last of the chili powder. She doesn\u2019t go to the store to replace the empty spice container. When dad moves back into the marital residence for his week with the kids, he decides to make a dish that calls for chili powder. When he expresses frustration that there is no more chili powder, the kids casually mention that mom made a big pot of chili the previous week. Dad then calls up mom and tells her how self-centered she is for having used up the last of the chili powder and not replacing it.\u201d\n\nSenterfitt notes that this is \u201ca pretty benign example,\u201d but adds, \u201cImagine if the issue were even more charged? What if dad\u2019s girlfriend spent time at the house and left her bra there? How is mom likely to respond when she finds the unmentionables of her ex\u2019s new squeeze? Sharing a residence creates too many opportunities for parents to trigger one another which will not benefit the children.\u201d\n\nAll that said, Senterfitt still does see nesting sometimes pan out successfully for the very short-term.\n\n\u201cThe only instances I am aware of in which parents have made nesting work is when it is done on a very time-limited basis (e.g. for the remainder of a child\u2019s senior year in high school) and when the parents have had a very amicable divorce (e.g. they both wanted to end the marriage and are committed to putting the children\u2019s interests ahead of their own),\u201d Senterfitt says. \u201c[But] this describes a very small portion of divorcing couples.\u201d\n\nNesting not an option? You can still do right by your kids in divorce\n\nEven if you do want to give nesting a try, it\u2019s not always a feasible plan. Money is key (along with figuring out who will maintain the costs of the familial home as well as that additional rotating apartment), as is a supremely calm and committed attitude which calls to mind the \u201cconscious uncoupling\u201d method made famous by Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin in their apparently gracious divorce and co-parenting system.\n\nNesting or not, consider what you should do to put your children\u2019s well-being and mental health first if divorcing.\n\n\u201cRegardless of how you choose to divorce, being mindful of the potential effects to your kids is crucial,\u201d says Viciere. \u201cSome parents struggle with having difficult but realistic conversations with their kids in an effort to 'protect' them. Contrary to popular belief, you aren't truly protecting your children by avoiding having these conversations. Rather, it hurts them when you aren't being honest about what\u2019s taking place. Kids tend to already have an idea of what\u2019s going on and are quite perceptive of their environments. It's expected that kids will have a hard time with divorce, but if you can be upfront with them about what's happening, and allow them to ask questions and have conversations around how they feel about what\u2019s taking place, it will help in navigating them through the situation.\u201d\n\nDr. Walfish adds the following tips for the newly divorced or divorcing parents:\n\n\"Keep structure and routine the same in both homes. Maintain the same bedtime, mealtimes, wakeup time, homework schedule and extracurricular activities. The more stable your child's life and routine, the less separation anxiety they will suffer.\n\nMaintain the same bedtime, mealtimes, wakeup time, homework schedule and extracurricular activities.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Source: Associated Press By Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Shortly after 9/11, the CIA considered using a drug it thought might work like a truth serum and force terror suspects to give up information about potential attacks.\n\nAfter months of research, the agency decided that a drug called Versed, a sedative often prescribed to reduce anxiety, was \"possibly worth a try.\" But in the end, the CIA decided not to ask government lawyers to approve its use.\n\nThe existence of the drug research program \u2014 dubbed \"Project Medication\" \u2014 is disclosed in a once-classified report that was provided to the American Civil Liberties Union under a judge's order and was released by the organization Tuesday.\n\nThe 90-page CIA report, which was provided in advance to The Associated Press, is a window into the internal struggle that medical personnel working in the agency's detention and harsh interrogation program faced in reconciling their professional ethics with the chance to save lives by preventing future attacks.\n\n\"This document tells an essential part of the story of how it was that the CIA came to torture prisoners against the law and helps prevent it from happening again,\" said ACLU attorney Dror Ladin.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2007, CIA doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and nurses were directly involved in the interrogation program, the report said. They evaluated, monitored and cared for 97 detainees in 10 secret CIA facilities abroad and accompanied detainees on more than 100 flights.\n\nThe CIA ultimately decided against asking the Justice Department to approve drug-assisted interrogations, sparing CIA doctors \"some significant ethical concerns,\" the report said. It had taken months for the Justice Department to sign off on brutal interrogation tactics, including sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces and the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding. The CIA's counterterrorism team \"did not want to raise another issue with the Department of Justice,\" the report said.\n\nBefore settling on Versed, the report said researchers studied records of old Soviet drug experiments as well as the CIA's discredited MK-Ultra program from the 1950s and 1960s that involved human experimentation with LSD and other mind-altering drugs on unwitting individuals as part of a long search for some form of truth serum. These experiments were widely criticized and, even today, some experts doubt an effective substance exists.\n\n\"But decades later, the agency was considering experimenting on humans again to test pseudo-scientific theories of learned helplessness on its prisoners,\" Ladin said.\n\nVersed is a brand name for the sedative midazolam, used since the late 1970s and today sold commonly as a generic. It causes drowsiness and relieves anxiety and agitation. It also can temporarily impair memory, and often is used for minor surgery or medical procedures such as colonoscopies that require sedation but not full-blown anesthesia. It's in a class of anti-anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines that work by affecting a brain chemical that calms the activity of nerve cells.\n\n\"Versed was considered possibly worth a trial if unequivocal legal sanction first were obtained,\" the report said. \"There were at least two legal obstacles: a prohibition against medical experimentation on prisoners and a ban on interrogational use of 'mind-altering drugs' or those which 'profoundly altered the senses.'\"\n\nThose questions became moot after the CIA decided against asking the Justice Department to give it a green light. \"At the beginning of 2003, the Office of Medical Services' review, informally termed 'Project Medication' was shelved, never to be reactivated,\" the report said.\n\nThe CIA had no comment on the report's release, but government lawyers emphasized in a court filing in the case early last year that the report, expressly marked \"draft,\" was just one agency officer's impressions of the detention and interrogation program. The document is not the CIA's or the Office of Medical Service's \"final official history, or assessment, of the program,\" the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe ACLU spent more than two years in court trying to get the report released. In September 2017, a federal judge in New York ordered the CIA to release it. Government lawyers tried three more times to keep information contained in the report under wraps, but the ACLU received the bulk of the report in August. The government is still fighting to keep portions secret. They are to file briefs in a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday, arguing that the judge ordered too much released.\n\nWhile the CIA's harsh interrogation program ended in 2007, the ACLU believes it's important to continue seeking the release of documents about it, especially since President Donald Trump declared during his campaign that he would approve interrogating terror suspects with waterboarding, which is now banned by U.S. law, and a \"hell of a lot worse.\"\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who was involved in supervising a secret CIA detention site in Thailand where detainees were waterboarded, told the Senate during her confirmation hearing that she does \"not support use of enhanced interrogation techniques for any purpose.\"\n\nThe report cites many instances where medical personal expressed concern or protected the health of the detainees. Those who were thrown up against walls \u2014 a practice called \"walling\" \u2014 had their necks protected from whiplash by rolled towels around their necks, the report said. When one detainee, who had been wounded during capture, was confined to a box, care was taken not to force his legs into a position that \"would compromise wound healing.\" Physician assistants overruled using duct tape over the mouths of detainees during flights because air sickness could lead to vomiting and possible aspiration.\n\n\"That doesn't mean that the doctors were sadistic or anything like that,\" Ladin said. \"But it means they were complicit because this pseudo-scientific torture could not have happened without the doctors' participation.\"\n\nAt the same time, the medical office's report said waterboarding was not \"intrinsically painful.\" It said there was \"physical discomfort from the occasional associated retching,\" but that two detainees who endured the most extensive waterboarding sessions complained only \"of the pain of the restraining straps.\"\n\nThat contrasts with the Senate's 2014 report on the CIA's interrogation program, which stated that a prisoner known as Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al-Qaida operative who was waterboarded more than 80 times, \"cried, begged, pleaded, vomited, and required medical resuscitation after being waterboarded.\"\n\nSome CIA medical personnel called waterboarding \"little more than an amateurish experiment\" and others worried that the practice would trigger spasms of the vocal cords, which could, at least temporarily, make it hard to speak or breathe.\n\nAt the same time, other medical personnel contended waterboarding actually \"provided periodic relief\" to a prisoner because it was a break from being forced to stand for long periods of time. The agency medical personnel also said the harsh interrogation program was \"reassuringly free of enduring physical or psychological effects.\"\n\nDr. Sondra Crosby, who has treated victims of torture, including two who were held at CIA secret sites, disagreed.\n\n\"The enduring pain and suffering experienced by the survivors of the CIA program is immense, and includes severe, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, physical ailments, and psychosocial dysfunction,\" said Crosby, of Boston University's School of Medicine and Public Health. \"At least one detainee was tortured to death. Their physical and psychological scars will last a lifetime.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But Mueller is facing pressure to wrap up his inquiry, and he may want to avoid a lengthy court fight.\n\n\"I can\u2019t imagine that a prosecutor as good as Bob Mueller would think that written answers to written questions\u2026 are sufficient,\" former federal prosecutor Chuck Rosenberg said on MSNBC. \"I imagine that the Mueller team is still going to want to sit down with the president.\"\n\nMueller has the option of issuing a grand jury subpoena to seek to compel the president to answer questions under oath and in person, but that could lead to months of litigation. The courts have ruled that the president is not exempt from giving evidence in a criminal investigation, but they have not ruled on the exact question of whether the president can be compelled to testify.\n\nWhen President Bill Clinton testified before a grand jury in 1998 as part of special counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s investigation, he did so voluntarily.\n\nTrump\u2019s move to answer questions comes as Mueller appears to be tightening the legal noose around some of his associates who are suspected of having advanced knowledge about hacked emails during the campaign.\n\nOne of them, Jerome Corsi, says he expects to be charged with perjury, and another, Roger Stone, has also said he expects to be indicted.", "Schumer, Nelson urge Trump to 'stop bullying' Florida election officials copied!\n\nSenators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Bill Nelson (D-FL) held a joint news conference urging President Trump and Gov.

The actress said \"out of fear and depression\" she decided to get drunk in order to confront him on Dec. 23, 2010, the suit stated.\n\nDue to how intoxicated she was, de la Huerta could not \"consent to any disputed sexual encounter.\" Weinstein was allegedly waiting for de la Huerta in the lobby of her building when she got home, the papers charged.\n\nDe la Huerta said she told the producer to leave and he \"hushed her\" and said he wanted to speak in her apartment to resolve things. The suit stated Weinstein forced his way into the apartment and allegedly raped de la Huerta a second time.\n\n\"Weinstein left immediately after he raped de la Huerta, leaving de la Huerta in a state of absolute shock, humiliation, embarrassment, and pain,\" the suit stated.\n\nAccording to the complaint, de la Huerta said she did not see Weinstein again until January 2011 when she was in Beverly Hills for an event. The suit stated Weinstein had a room at the Four Seasons hotel and invited de la Huerta to have drinks in the lobby.\n\nShe decided she would use the opportunity to try and confront Weinstein again and tell him to leave her alone, the suit stated.\n\nWhen de la Huerta got to his hotel room, Weinstein allegedly opened the door in a bathrobe, exposing himself to the actress. He also allegedly asked her to have a threesome with him and another woman in the room who was naked.\n\nDe la Huerta said she refused, told Weinstein to leave her alone and fled the hotel room.\n\nShe said in the suit that she believes Weinstein retaliated by having her fired from \"Boardwalk Empire\" after two seasons, which cost her $55 million in earnings over the course of her career.\n\nWeinstein's lawyer dismissed de la Huerta's claims in a statement to NBC News.\n\n\"It is our understanding that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office carefully reviewed Ms. De la Huerta's claims of sexual assault by Mr Weinstein many months ago and made a conscious decision to reject her as a complainant for obvious reasons,\" Benjamin Brafman said.\n\n\"We also believe that her newly minted version of events including her new California claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination.\"\n\nThe former Hollywood produce has been accused of wrongdoing by dozens of women.

Marc Dennis was in charge of calibrating the devices, and authorities have alleged that he skipped a required step in the calibration process. Dennis has denied any wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to records tampering and other charges.\n\nThe court's decision means that as many as 20,667 DWI convictions could now be challenged, according to state authorities and the lawyer for the now-dead plaintiff who brought the case that the court ruled on.\n\nThe accusations against Dennis called into question any test result involving a machine he handled, including devices used by local police in Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset, and Union counties between 2008 and 2016.\n\nState authorities have maintained that the step Dennis allegedly skipped was one of several redundancies and fail-safes meant to ensure the readings are accurate. They claim that omitting that one step didn't invalidate the results, noting New Jersey is the only state that requires the step.\n\nThe Supreme Court, though, sided with Judge Joseph Lisa, who was appointed as a special master to handle the issue. He found the step omission raised substantial doubts about the reliability of the machines.\n\nAs part of their decision, the justices ordered state authorities to notify anyone whose case involved results from machines Dennis calibrated.

Will the retail giant collect on the full amount of initiatives from all locations?\n\nNo, said location consultant John Boyd. \"These packages will be reworked under this current [development] model,\" he said.\n\nA park in Long Island City in the Queens borough of New York, along the East River, on Nov. 7, 2018. Justin Lane / EPA\n\nBut still, the amount of assistance that Amazon will receive is enormous. The company will receive upwards of $2.8 billion in performance-based incentives from the three cities: $1.85 billion from New York, $819 million from Virginia, and $102 million from Nashville. Amazon said it will apply for additional funding from other government sources.\n\nThe staggering sums raise what has becoming an increasingly popular question: Are incentives a smart investment?\n\nAmazon temptation\n\nAmazon said it intended to invest a total of $5 billion in buildings, infrastructure, and operational expenses. Another $8.3 billion in eventual annual compensation for 55,000 employees would offer income tax opportunities for the winning location.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is expected to build, purchase, and occupy 9 million square feet in building use, with a possibility of up to another 8 million \u2014 not to mention hundreds of thousands of annual hotel nights, and tens of millions of dollars in local transportation.\n\nPedrestrians cross Crystal Drive in the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia, on Nov. 13, 2018. Mark Wilson / Getty Images\n\nThat's why cities from Canada to Mexico competed for the business.\n\nWhile the initial packages from either Arlington or New York City aren't known, the latter offered $20 million in performance-based tax credits and $55 million to renovate an office space, based on 2,000 jobs in finance, sales, marketing, and IT.\n\nThe promise and reality\n\n\"Whether it's 100 or 20,000 employees, it's an invigoration of the immediate economy,\" said Jeffrey Citron, managing partner of New York law firm Davidoff Hutcher & Citron. \"It helps maintain the private sector and there's an ancillary benefit to other businesses.\"\n\n\"Not only does it grow the economy, there's a cachet and branding value that kick starts other investment,\" Boyd told NBC News.\n\nBut the reality can be tough to measure. Jobs may open for people in the local area or, depending on the size of the city, might attract new residents.\n\n\"If it's 50,000 jobs [in a large city], how many of them will be people moving from existing jobs to new jobs?\" said Amihai Glazer, a professor of economics at the University of California, Irvine. The previous employers may not hire replacements immediately, dampening the impact.\n\nPlus, promises are often broken. In 2016, Boston and Massachusetts offered GE $1 million in customized training, $25 million in property tax reductions over 20 years, and a reported $250 million in infrastructure investments for the company's new headquarters and 800 jobs that were to follow. But GE fell on harder times: Two years later, the number of positions has only reached about 235.\n\nResentment sets in\n\nCritics question the general value that states and cities receive. \"There's a reasonable amount of evidence that tax incentives don't much benefit the locality that offers them,\" Glazer said.\n\nThe jobs measure is important because that becomes the draw politicians present to their constituencies. But in general, tracking down the economic effect is tricky, making the measurement of success potentially flawed.\n\nIt's \"money for the 'haves,' who have the least need for this but are being paid in essence a ransom or bribe to come or stay here,\" said David Lewis, a human resources consultant in Norwalk, Connecticut.\n\nAccording to Ryan McMaken, an economist and senior editor at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, the attempt to attract big businesses may be misplaced. \"Had these policymakers simply adopted policies that benefited local small business owners and entrepreneurs, they may very well have had at least as much job growth,\" he said. \"But that job growth would be harder to calculate and attribute to a single new policy or to certain businesses.\" And harder to take credit for.\n\n\"The public and many lawmakers are growing skeptical,\" Boyd said. \"You have candidates running against the idea of corporate welfare.\"\n\nMaybe Amazon will be a last hurrah.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Alastair Jamieson\n\nLONDON \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday evening that her cabinet had agreed to accept a fragile draft Brexit deal with the European Union.\n\nMay had been planning to confront a divided Cabinet to discuss her proposed agreement on divorce terms, including a plan to resolve the key issue of the Irish land border.\n\n\"I firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement was the best that could be negotiated and it was for the cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks,\" May said on Wednesday evening, adding that the collective decision of the cabinet was that the government should agree to the draft agreement.\n\nShe said she would make a full statement at Parliament in the morning.\n\nWith only 135 days until Britain leaves the European Union, the agreement is May\u2019s last chance to exit the trading bloc with some kind of deal on customs and trade arrangements. Without it, Britain could face chaos at ports and border posts \u2014 a scenario that has already prompted the stockpiling of food and medicines.\n\nThe Wednesday meeting was the first of many hurdles for May's draft agreement.

Kyrsten Sinema was declared the apparent winner of Arizona\u2019s nail-biter of a Senate race. In addition to a win for Democrats, Sinema\u2019s hard-fought victory also adds to the spoils of the so-called rainbow wave that ushered in a record number of LGBTQ political candidates this year.\n\nSinema\u2019s high-profile win is particularly historic. She is the first out bisexual person ever elected to the U.S. Senate and only the second openly LGBTQ person, behind Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., who is a lesbian. Sinema is also the Grand Canyon State\u2019s first female senator and its first Democratic senator since 1995.\n\nRobyn Ochs, a bisexual advocate and editor of Bi Women Quarterly, said Sinema\u2019s victory is a sign of progress for both the bisexual community and society at large.\n\n\u201cTo have out bisexual officials be elected to public office signifies that we have made progress in our understanding and acceptance of bisexual people,\u201d Ochs told NBC News. \u201cOur cultural mainstream understanding and acceptance of lesbian and gay people has progressed much more than our understanding of bi and trans people, and this election cycle has been really important.\u201d\n\nSinema is no stranger to making history though. When she joined the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, she became the first openly bisexual member of either body of Congress. However, Ochs said historic candidates like Sinema are often navigating a delicate balancing act.\n\n\u201cOut LGBT politicians in general have to walk that tightrope of not having their identity center on their sexual orientation, but rather on their competency and professionalism, and at the same time recognizing that they\u2019re possibility models for people,\u201d Ochs explained. \u201c[Sinema\u2019s] obviously navigating that tightrope quite successfully, but I don't think there's an easy way to navigate it \u2014 it\u2019s a challenge, because there are tremendous stereotypes about LGBTQ people in general.\u201d\n\n'A stunning victory'\n\nOn election night, it appeared as if Sinema\u2019s Republican opponent, Rep. Martha McSally, had won the Senate seat being vacated by Jeff Flake, but due to Arizona\u2019s notoriously slow vote-counting process, Sinema slowly chipped away at McSally\u2019s lead.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, Sinema had 1,097,321 votes (49.7 percent) compared to McSally\u2019s 1,059,124 votes (48.0 percent), with 92 percent of the precincts reporting.\n\nMcSally, a retired U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, posted a concession video to her Twitter account late on Monday.\n\nSinema\u2019s historic win bolsters Democrats\u2019 outlook in the Senate, where Republicans increased their majority by one seat overall. While Democrats lost three seats in the upper chamber \u2014 North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana \u2014 they gained two: Nevada and Arizona, emphasizing the party\u2019s growing strength in Sun Belt states (Florida, another Sun Belt state, will determine winners for senator and governor in a recount currently underway).\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called Sinema\u2019s win \u201ca stunning victory,\u201d and noted its historic relevance.\n\n\u201cArizonans went to the polls last Tuesday looking for bold new leadership, and that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re going to get with their first-ever female senator and our nation\u2019s second openly LGBTQ senator,\u201d Perez said in a statement shared with NBC News.\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Jessica Levinson, professor at Loyola Law School\n\nWhen Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer, plead guilty in open court in August 2018 to violating campaign finance laws, he also implicated Trump. At the time, these accusations were tantalizing but largely unproven. And of course there were the president\u2019s vehement denials that he was aware of the payments that gave rise to Cohen\u2019s guilty plea.\n\nBut the evidence keeps mounting. Based on legal documents and dozens of interviews, the Wall Street Journal has published an article demonstrating Trump\u2019s pivotal role in the payments that Cohen made or facilitated. The Journal\u2019s report makes it increasingly difficult for Trump to believably claim he knew nothing of the payments made to silence adult film star Stephanie Clifford (popularly known as Stormy Daniels) and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claim to have had affairs with him.\n\nAs Cohen admitted under oath in open court, he made or facilitated payments to buy both women\u2019s silence at Trump\u2019s direction. Cohen says he paid directly paid Stormy Daniels $130,000 in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nThe second payment involves McDougal. According to the Journal\u2019s reporting, Trump made an explicit agreement with his friend, David Pecker, the chairman of America Media (AMI), that Pecker would \u201ccatch and kill\u201d stories by women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump. (AMI is the parent company of the National Inquirer.) \u201cCatch and kill\u201d is a practice by which certain media corporations will pay for exclusive access to stories and then not publish them, ensuring that those stories never become known to the public. Cohen says he helped facilitate the $150,000 payment by AMI to McDougal in exchange for her story and modeling opportunities.\n\nThe threshold legal question is whether the payments were made to keep Trump\u2019s marriage together (for personal reasons) or to keep the campaign together (for political reasons).\n\nThe threshold legal question is whether the payments were made to keep Trump\u2019s marriage together (for personal reasons) or to keep the campaign together (for political reasons). Payments made \u201cfor the purpose of influencing\u201d a federal election are covered by federal campaign finance law. Payments made for personal reasons are not.\n\nAccording to Cohen, both of these payments were made to influence the election; he told us so in open court.\n\nBut we don\u2019t even have to believe Cohen. There is plenty of other evidence to suggest that these payments were made to keep Trump\u2019s political aspirations alive. For one thing, Cohen made the payment to Stormy Daniels mere weeks before the election. Trump\u2019s current personal attorney, Rudy Guilianni, made the implications of this payment and its timing clear on national television. \u201cImagine if that [the allegation] came out on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton,\u201d he told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in May.\n\nSimilarly, it appears the payment to McDougal is covered by federal campaign finance law because it was made to help Trump\u2019s presidential run. The Journal\u2019s reporting indicates that Trump and Pecker agreed that payments would be made to \u201ccatch and kill\u201d stories in order to help Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nOnce it is established that both payments were made to try to get Trump elected, the next question is how exactly each payment violates campaign finance law.\n\nThe federal limit for contributions to federal candidates is $2,700. If the $130,000 payment made by Cohen to Stormy Daniels is viewed as an indirect contribution to the Trump campaign \u2014 which I believe it should \u2014 the contribution is $127,300 over the limit. Cohen detailed this in his guilty plea. Cohen also says he was later repaid, with interest and a bonus, for the payment to Daniels. This raises the secondary question of whether the payment could also be viewed as an improper loan to the Trump campaign that was not reported.\n\nMeanwhile, it can be argued that the $150,000 payment AMI made to McDougal was an illegal in-kind corporate contribution to Trump\u2019s campaign. Federal law prohibits corporations from contributing to campaigns.\n\nThere are two reasons why we should view the payment from AMI to McDougal as an illegal corporate contribution. First, per the explicit agreement between Pecker and Trump, the payment was made for the purposes of influencing the election. The fact that, according to the Journal, AMI told McDougal its payment was made both to catch and kill her story and to secure her modeling services does not save AMI from liability. AMI\u2019s actions and the Journal\u2019s reporting make it pretty clear that AMI\u2019s alleged payment for modeling services was really just a pretext for purchasing and killing the story.\n\nThere is a so-called \u201cpress exemption\u201d or \u201cmedia exemption\u201d in federal law that allows media corporations broad latitude in deciding which stories to publish and which candidates to endorse, as long as they are performing a \u201clegitimate press function.\u201d If a right-wing media corporation decided not to report on stories critical of Trump, for example, that would be perfectly legal. But I do not believe AMI was acting as media corporation in this case and therefore should not be eligible for the protections afforded to medial corporations. It did not merely decide to steer clear of coverage critical of Trump. Instead, it explicitly agreed to buy up stories critical of Trump and prevent other media corporations from obtaining that information and reporting it. The fact that Cohen was involved at all adds even more evidence to the argument that AMI was working on behalf of the Trump campaign.\n\nCohen pled guilty and AMI is now cooperating with federal prosecutors in exchange for a grant of immunity. But do Cohen and AMI\u2019s legal problems impact Trump? They certainly won't help him. Some legal experts who have examined Cohen\u2019s guilty plea, like former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman, believe Cohen implicated Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator. Cohen\u2019s lawyer Lanny Davis certainly shares this view, telling the press, \u201cDonald Trump directed [Cohen] to commit a crime by paying payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election.\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, has continued to deny any wrongdoing or knowledge of the payments. But those denials are becoming harder and harder to believe.\n\nHowever, for Trump to be criminally liable for campaign finance violations, he must have knowingly and willfully violated those laws. This is important. If Trump can believably claim he did not know what he was doing was illegal, he should not be charged with criminally violating federal campaign finance laws. And therefore the question boils down to, as it always does, what did the president know and when did he know it.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It didn't help.\n\n\u201cThe bombing was so loud and my daughters didn\u2019t stop crying,\u201d said Al Hatoum, who is 33 and lives with his family in western Gaza.\n\nThe government employee not only heard the explosions, he smelled and felt them.\n\n\u201cI felt the entire building shaking,\u201d he told NBC News, describing the effect as like a magnitude 7 earthquake.\n\nViolence is nothing new for civilians inside the crowded and desperately-poor strip that has been run by Hamas militants since 2007, nor is it new to those in Israeli communities nearby. Israel has fought three wars in the enclave during the last decade and fears are growing that a new conflict is on the way.\n\nChildren from Nirim climb on a tank near the the Gaza Strip. Menahem Kahana / AFP/Getty Images file\n\nSince Monday, Hamas and other armed factions fired over 400 rockets or mortars across the fenced border \u2014 the most intense rocket fire on Israel since the 2014 war \u2014 the Israeli military said. This came after militants carried out a missile attack on a bus that wounded an Israeli soldier.\n\nThis follows months of fires caused by hundreds of incendiary kites and explosive balloons sent from Gaza. The blazes have burned thousands of acres of nature reserves and farm lands.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin visited the border community of Netivot telling Israeli citizens to \u201ctake good care of themselves\u201d and to follow the order of the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs issued a statement saying they had told the Israeli military to \u201ccontinue its operations if necessary.\u201d\n\nThe recent fighting appeared to have been set off by a botched Israeli special forces raid in Gaza Sunday that left seven Palestinians dead, including a local Hamas commander, as well as an Israeli army officer.

He is not hopeful for the future.\n\n\u201cThere will be an escalation in Gaza, there will be no calm after this,\u201d he said.\n\nIsraelis are also scared.\n\nHila Fenlon, who is a farmer in the small Israeli village of Netiv Haasara a few yards from the dividing fence, said her family is shaken by both Israeli and Palestinian fire.\n\nShe said she turned her children\u2019s bedroom into a missile shelter so they could get to safety in time before the rockets fell.\n\n\u201cWhenever I hear the sirens, my heart skips a beat,\u201d she said, explaining it was hard to persuade her children to stay in or near the shelter at all times.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re in war all the time, not just the last couple of days,\u201d she said. \u201cMy children are exposed to rockets, incendiary balloons and burnt land.\u201d\n\nFenlon said she hoped for peace. \u201cI wish we can go back to being neighbors like we used to,\u201d she said.\n\nEven before the exchange of fire of the last few days, fear reigned in what is known as the Gaza envelop \u2014 the area of Israel surrounding the Gaza Strip.\n\nAdele Raemer, a 63-year-old ESL teacher who lives in the community of Nirim also on the border with Gaza, said there was little they could do.\n\nAdele Raemer with her granddaughters, 6-month-old Raz and and 3-year-old Ziv, in June. Dusan Vranic / for NBC News\n\n\"We are used to riding this roller coaster,\" Raemer said. \"Nobody likes the roller coaster, but we are on it. And the thing is \u2014 you never know when you are going to get on it and you never know when this ride is over.\"\n\nIn Gaza, which can be seen from Nirim, desperation is a way of life.\n\nSome 70 percent of Gaza's population are refugees or descendants of refugees, and a similar proportion depends on humanitarian aid. Those living there cannot leave without permission and the blockade has made life intolerable for many of Gaza\u2019s 2 million residents.\n\nAlmost none of the water is clean, raw sewage is pumped straight into the sea and worsening power shortages mean Gazans have electricity for only around four hours a day on average. Unemployment rates are close to 50 percent \u2014 more than 65 percent among those under 30.\n\nSince March, thousands of Palestinian protesters have marched towards the fence which separates Israel from the Gaza Strip demanding the right to enter Israel and reclaim homes their family left after the country was founded in 1948. Some 220 have been shot dead and around 24,000 wounded, according to Gazan health officials. Israel maintains many of those hurt and killed on the fence are in fact militants masquerading as peaceful protesters.\n\nDespite regular violence, Ma\u2019amoun Shawaf, a 23-year-old owner of a coffee shop in Khan Younis, knew Sunday night was \u201csomething big.\u201d\n\nOn hearing gunfire and people shouting \u201cIsraeli forces, go back, go back,\u201d Shawaf said he raced to the scene. \u201cI started telling my friends that the war will start tonight.\u201d\n\nLawahez Jabari reported from Tel Aviv.

He controlled Sicarios [hitmen] and ordered them to kill, and sometimes he did the killings himself,\" Fels said.\n\nHe recounted Guzman's rise from low-level marijuana dealer to alleged cocaine kingpin.\n\nGuzman made his mark by slashing delivery time, using tunnels and a few planes to make swift deliveries while building up relationships with the Colombian cartels, the prosecutor said.\n\n\"He played a critical role in the supply chain,\" Fels continued. \"Soon he was using more tunnels, planes,trains, cars, fishing boats and even submarines.\n\nHe escaped jail twice and his mystique grew.

He sent his killers to wipe out his rivals and he used sophisticated methods of communications including encrypted cell phones and apps, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Little did he know the U.S. government was listening,\" Fels said. \"You will hear him in his own words and text messages running his drug empire, drug deals, his corruption and murders.\"\n\nProsecutors are also expected to use testimony from a dozen cooperating witnesses to prove their allegations that Guzman is the murderous head \"of the largest drug drug trafficking organization in the world.\"\n\nGuzman, 61, is standing trial on a 17-count indictment charging him with drug trafficking, murder conspiracy and money laundering.\n\nHis lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, focused on the cooperating witnesses in his opening statement \u2014 calling them \"people who will make your skin crawl.\"\n\n\"Imagine a group of witnesses who have lied every day of their lives. They are killers, thieves, drug dealers,\" Lichtman said. \"Why is the government using gutter human beings?\"\n\nHe said the case will show that \"government officials at the highest levels can be bribed and American law enforcement officials can be corrupt.\"\n\nAs for his client, Lichtman said he's been framed.\n\n\"Biggest drug dealer in the world! It's false. It's not true,\" he said,\n\n\"Why is he public enemy #1? Because 25 years ago a Mexican cardinal was shot by mistake at an airport and Guzman was the intended target.

Elena had struggled with her weight for almost 30 years, beginning with her first pregnancy, when bedrest and a battle with depression sent her weight shooting up from 120 to more than 200 pounds. She gained and lost weight over the years, ultimately peaking at 237 pounds.\n\nFor Bill, a creeping sedentary lifestyle coupled with poor eating habits drove his weight gain. \u201cWe\u2019re empty nesters. Once the kids got out of the house we started eating out more. Not that we were eating badly, but we shouldn\u2019t have had such big portions,\u201d he says. \u201cAs you get older your system starts slowing down, and with that your weight starts going up. It\u2019s such a gradual thing you don\u2019t really notice it. Then you see a picture of yourself and think, \u2018Wow, my face really filled in.\u2019\u201d\n\nBill Rodriguez, before and after weight loss Courtesy of Bill Rodriguez\n\nWhen Bill spotted a coworker who had lost a lot of weight, he asked how he did it. It turned out he had joined the Profile by Sanford program.\n\nElena was dubious at first. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just another weight-loss plan. I\u2019ve tried them all.\u2019 If there was a diet I tried it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m 48 and my goal was to lose weight by the age of 40. That never happened \u2014 I had let myself down. Everything else had failed. I was at the last straw. I felt like if this doesn\u2019t work, nothing will,\u201d she says.\n\nElena Rodriguez, before and after weight loss Courtesy of Elena Rodriguez\n\nIn April 2017 they decided to give it a shot, together. The plan cost them each $150 for a year. For Elena, the price motivated her to stick with it. She committed to following the plan without cheating \u2014 that way, she figured, if she didn\u2019t lose weight she could ask for her money back.\n\nA HARD LOOK AT FOOD CHOICES\n\nBill and Elena changed their diets in the first three to four months on Profile, and stuck with those changes. Fatty, fried, and junk foods were out, replaced by Profile\u2019s shakes, bars, and soups, lots of raw and steamed vegetables, and tons of water.\n\n\u201cThey give you a shopping list of items to go look for to make your meals. It really just teaches you to eat better,\u201d Bill says. The couple cooked together and encouraged each other. While Profile supports a range of food choices, Bill and Elena eventually moved to a vegetarian, then vegan, diet. \u201cWe looked into different reasons we gain weight, and even foods that are considered to be good foods drive weight gain,\u201d Bill says.\n\nCONNECTING WITH SUPPORT\n\nFor Elena, what made the difference this time was accountability. First, they committed to losing weight as a couple. \u201cI think the fact that we did it together was a key factor, and that the things we changed really fit well with us,\u201d Bill says. Elena notes that trying to lose weight together with Bill brought out her competitive side.\n\nSecond, the plan includes a smart scale that measures and records weight, body fat, hydration, muscle and bone.\n\nAnd third, the plan includes coaching. \u201cI felt pretty high-class having a coach,\u201d Elena says. Profile\u2019s coaches connect with members regularly in person or via Skype or phone to talk about how they\u2019re doing. \u201cIf you\u2019re really craving something, or if you were starving or felt a specific way, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, try eating this or doing this.\u2019 You can make these simple little adjustments to fill that void you\u2019re feeling,\u201d Bill says.\n\nElena worked with a few coaches, and says that while they were all great, she clicked with Ashleigh Ackley. \u201cIt felt like she knew me. She knew my story, my struggles, my anxieties. I felt like I could tell her everything and she always had a solution. She would say, \u2018Try this and see if this works,\u2019 and if I wasn\u2019t ready to do something that was OK. It was like I had a teammate who wasn\u2019t going to let me fail. She built me up and that\u2019s much of the reason this is still working. She really ingrained in me opportunities and options. She showed me how to rely on things that worked. A lot of the weight situation is really emotional for me, and she kept building me up, pumping into my head that it\u2019s OK and it\u2019s going to work,\u201d she says.\n\nAckley calls coaching the backbone of the program. \u201cEveryone is different, but there are always outside temptations and challenges,\u201d she says. \u201cWe guide members. We don\u2019t tell them what to do. We help them have success.\u201d\n\nMost coaching sessions start with a review of the previous week \u2014 looking back at what went well and what was challenging. They then look forward to the upcoming week to spot challenges. For example, there might be travel planned, or sports events with tempting concessions, or weeknights at home fighting a snacking habit.\n\nAckley recalls helping Elena plan for a work event. They talked about Elena\u2019s goals \u2014 did she want to indulge there, or make healthier choices from what was available, or bring her own foods? What foods will they have, and what are their serving sizes? Planning ahead of time helps people enjoy the events in their lives without sabotaging their weight-loss goals.\n\nSEEING HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS\n\nBill and Elena want to be around to watch their four grandchildren grow up. Elena\u2019s father was only 66 when he passed away after a stroke, and he had had high blood pressure and diabetes. \u201cI have grandchildren now. I don\u2019t want to be old and miserable. I want to enjoy my life. I don\u2019t want to put my kids through loss, and I don\u2019t want to enhance the possibility of dying,\u201d she says.\n\nTheir weight loss has led to improvements in their health. While they both battled high blood pressure, they have healthy levels now, and Elena no longer needs medication to control hers. She\u2019s also seen improvement in vitiligo, a skin condition that causes loss of pigment. They expect that their healthier diets will reduce their likelihood of developing diabetes.\n\nTheir weight loss has brought a financial benefit as well. They get a discount on their health insurance if they meet certain criteria for body mass index, blood pressure and other health markers. \u201cNot only are we healthier, now we qualify for that discount,\u201d Bill says.\n\nA BOOST IN ACTIVITY\n\nIn the past, Elena and Bill walked a local 5K event. This year, they ran it together for the first time. Bill has added strength training to his routine. \u201cGiven my age, I have to start working on building more muscle. When you\u2019re building muscle, you tend to burn fat more efficiently,\u201d he says. \u201cWith a sedentary lifestyle you get that muscle atrophy.\u201d\n\nOutside of workouts, their grandchildren keep them active, biking alongside them while they run. Bill has even joined them skateboarding. \u201cThat\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t have considered doing, as heavy as I was,\u201d he says. They also paddleboard most weekends when the weather is good.\n\nMAINTAINING SUCCESS\n\nElena and Bill met their weight-loss goals and also learned how to cope with temporary setbacks. For example, Elena tends to gain a few pounds when she travels. And when they remodeled their house they couldn\u2019t cook at home. \u201cAshley taught me that this is OK, and this is what we need to do to get back on track,\u201d Elena says.\n\nElena says, \u201cI feel better from the ground up. Even our sex life is better. Profile has redefined who I am \u2014 my body and my spirit.\u201d\n\nBill and Elena's Typical Day\n\nBreakfast: A nectarine and an apple with a protein shake, or oatmeal with Stevia and maybe a banana\n\nLunch: Salad with salsa for dressing, pasta, or stir-fried or steamed vegetables, with quinoa, edamame, almonds or beans for protein\n\nDinner: Bean soup with avocado or a vegan pizza\n\nSnacks: Dairy-free yogurt with a piece of fruit, chopped veggies, sometimes homemade popcorn\n\n\u201c70 percent of what we eat is vegetable-driven,\u201d Bill says. \u201cIn the morning, we plan out our meals for the day and cut up all kinds of vegetables \u2014 cucumbers, carrots, radishes, snap peas\u2014sometimes 10 different vegetables.\u201d\n\nMORE WEIGHT-LOSS SUCCESS STORIES\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Pete Williams\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Maryland's attorney general on Tuesday challenged the appointment of what he called an \"unqualified\" partisan as acting attorney general and charged the president did it to protect himself from any accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nIn a lawsuit, Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh urged a federal judge to declare that Rod Rosenstein is the acting U.S. attorney general \u2014 not Matt Whitaker, who was named to that position last week after the forced resignation of Jeff Sessions.\n\nWhitaker's appointment has been widely criticized because he now oversees the special counsel's investigation of Russian election meddling. While serving as a conservative commentator, he questioned the scope of the investigation and said there was no Trump campaign collusion with the Russians. For that reason, several congressional Democrats have urged him to recuse himself from overseeing Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"It is troubling, to say the least, that the president is attempting to fill a 'vacancy' he created himself with a 'temporary' appointment that might last for many months or years,\" Frosh said, \"especially when, as there, the temporary appointee has not been confirmed by the Senate.\"\n\nFrosh said federal law and the Constitution \"protect the country against exactly what President Trump has attempted to do here \u2014 pluck an unqualified and unconfirmed partisan to be the nation's chief law enforcement officer in order to protect himself rather than the rule of law.\"\n\nIf the judge does as Maryland asks, ruling that Whitaker cannot serve as attorney general, it would be a blow to President Trump, who bypassed Rosenstein in favor of someone who has repeatedly criticized Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian election meddling.\n\nThe Justice Department would immediately appeal any such ruling, and the case could be on a fast track to the U.S. Supreme Court. Maryland asked the judge to put its motion on a fast track, but there was no indication of when the judge might act.\n\nTrump named Whitaker acting attorney general under a law known as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. It allows a president to fill a vacant cabinet position with a senior employee of the affected agency. Whitaker fits in that category, because he had been the chief of staff to Sessions.\n\nBut Maryland urged the judge to rule that a separate federal law actually governs what happens when the office of attorney general is vacant. It provides that the deputy attorney general takes over, which would be Rosenstein. As the state sees it, the Vacancies Reform Act is more general law, which must give way whenever a specific law provides for filling a cabinet-level vacancy.\n\nThe state also argued that the appointment of Whitaker violates a provision of the Constitution which specifies that top positions in the government can be filled only through presidential nomination and confirmation by the Senate. Because Whitaker's nomination bypassed that process, the state says, he cannot serve as acting attorney general.\n\nMaryland's legal papers said Whitaker's appointment marks the first time since 1868, when Congress passed a succession law for the Justice Department, that someone named to be acting attorney general was not already serving in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nThe state's motion came in a lawsuit over the future of Obamacare, seeking a ruling that the Affordable Care Act remains enforceable despite attempts by the Trump administration to shut it down. The case is the mirror image of a lawsuit filed by Texas and 17 other states. It asks a different federal judge to declare that the health care law is no longer enforceable.\n\nMaryland's Obamacare lawsuit named several defendants, including Sessions, who was attorney general when the case was filed in September.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It has a seat for one rider and four horizontally mounted electric propellers controlled by a pair of joysticks.\n\nThe sub-250-pound craft is designed to skim over the landscape at the company-specified \u201csafe altitude\" of about 16 feet and at speeds of up to 60 miles an hour. Its lithium-manganese-nickel batteries allow airborne jaunts of up to 25 minutes, according to the manufacturer, San Jose-based Hoversurf.\n\nNo license is needed to fly the carbon-fiber craft, as its low weight and low speed exempt it from FAA regulations. But with those fast-spinning propellers so close, you might need an extra measure of self-confidence.\n\n\u201cI think it's a good idea assuming that it can be made safe, which is questionable in my mind,\u201d said Richard Anderson, a professor of aerospace engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. \u201cI assume if you ran into somebody it would chop them up.\u201d\n\nHoversurf\u2019s chief operating officer, Joseph Segura-Conn, said the vehicle has numerous safety features, including a computer-controlled system for stabilizing the craft and laser scanners for detecting and avoiding obstacles. To help ensure the safety of the rider and of anyone who might get in the way, the company plans to offer extensive training to customers \u2014 and future models will be carried aloft not by propellers but by enclosed fans.\n\n\u201cIt looks frightening at the beginning, and you\u2019re unsure,\u201d said Segura-Conn, who is one of a handful of people who have flown one of the hoverbikes. \u201cBut as soon as you get up in the air, there\u2019s no experience like it.\u201d He said the first deliveries would be next May or June.\n\nHoversurf isn\u2019t the only company developing hoverbikes or similar piloted drones.\n\nThe Kitty Hawk Corporation of Mountain View, Calif. is developing a one-person electric flying vehicle called the Flyer; the company has been taking pre-orders but hasn\u2019t said when its craft will be commercially available.\n\nThe British company Malloy Aeronautics is working with the U.S. Department of Defense on a hoverbike that could move soldiers and equipment around a battlefield.\n\nAnd Israel-based Tactical Robotics is developing an autonomous flying vehicle dubbed \u201cCormorant\u201d to be used to as a sort of air ambulance that can quickly get into and out of dangerous areas to whisk injured soldiers to safety.\n\nFor now, hoverbikes are likely to be a niche product \u2014 in part because of their high cost. But Anderson thinks that as prices fall they could find a wider audience. \u201cI think for a recreational vehicle it's a great idea, or if you want to get around and not go too far,\u201d he said: \u201cI\u2019d like to fly it.\u201d\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT HIGH-TECH TRANSPORTATION?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Lee, Kristen Welker, Hallie Jackson and Courtney Kube\n\n\u00ad WASHINGTON \u2014 John Kelly, mired in conflicts with a widening array of officials from the National Security Council to the office of the first lady, may soon depart the Trump administration, according to seven people familiar with the discussions.\n\nNick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, is among those being considered for the job, three of the people said, though President Donald Trump has mused about other possible candidates.\n\nMelania Trump has ensured the departure of one White House official, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel, after she had a series of run-ins with the first lady\u2019s office.\n\nStephanie Grisham, the first lady\u2019s communications director, issued a pointed statement on Tuesday saying as much. \u201cIt is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\u201d Grisham said.\n\nIt\u2019s an extraordinary, if not unprecedented, move for the first lady\u2019s office to publicly call for the firing of a NSC official. Ricardel was seen at an official White House event with the president as Grisham's statement was was issued.\n\nKelly\u2019s time as chief of staff for most of the past year has been clouded by controversy and disagreements with Trump and various West Wing staff. But questions about his future in the White House recently became more serious after his repeated clashes with national security adviser John Bolton and his deputy, Ricardel.\n\nKelly has also gotten on the wrong side of Melania Trump over staffing issues and travel requests. Some of the disputes with the East Wing have escalated to the president, the seven people familiar with the clashes said.\n\nSIGN UP FOR NBC BREAKING NEWS EMAILS\n\n\"There have been instances where the East Wing staff were not treated as equals to the male-dominated decision makers in Chief Kelly\u2019s office,\" one White House official said. \"Promotions were denied then finally granted after months of requests,\" the official said.\n\nMelania Trump raised concerns with her husband earlier this year, amid the height of the controversy over his alleged affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels, that Kelly had repeatedly denied her requests to promote some of her aides, two White House officials told NBC News.\n\nThe requests languished for months as Kelly insisted there weren\u2019t enough available positions for the first lady\u2019s aides to have senior titles, these people said. During this same period however, West Wing officials working for Kelly received promotions, the White House officials said.\n\nHaving learned of the dispute, the president was furious and told Kelly to give the first lady, who has a smaller East Wing staff than her recent predecessors, what she wanted, these people said. \"I don't need this shit,\" Trump told Kelly, according to one person familiar with the conversation.\n\nKelly wouldn\u2019t be the first chief-of-staff to upset a first lady but history has shown that such disputes are tough to overcome.\n\nNancy Reagan was at odds with President Ronald Reagan\u2019s chief of staff, Donald Regan, which ultimately helped orchestrate his departure. And Hillary Clinton was at odds with President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff over her large role in policy decisions.\n\nTrump was especially annoyed, according to people familiar with his thinking, that he had to get involved in disputes involving his wife. His message to Kelly, according to one of them, repeatedly has been: \"Deal with it.\"\n\nThe promotions of the first lady\u2019s communications director, Grisham, and White House social secretary, Rickie Niceta, from special assistants to the president to deputy assistants to the president were ultimately cleared and announced in June.\n\nKelly has also sparred with the East Wing over travel arrangements for the first lady\u2019s staff, people familiar with the issue said. He often wouldn\u2019t reserve space for Melania Trump\u2019s two aides on Air Force One or on helicopters. They would find themselves without hotel rooms and not listed for motorcade movements. The omissions have caused last-minute logistical issues that the first lady viewed as a slight, these people said.\n\nThe White House declined to comment for this story.\n\n\"The East Wing is very focused on the First Lady\u2019s initiatives and works independently,\" Grisham said in a statement to NBC news. \"However, we do collaborate on a variety of projects and work alongside many departments within the west wing. We have a very positive working relationship,\" she said.\n\nThe first lady also took issue with Kelly over the ousting in March of her director of operations, Justin Caporale, and of John McEntee, the president\u2019s personal aide who had become close with the Trump family since working for him during the 2016 campaign, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe first lady liked and trusted both of them, according to current and former White House officials, and viewed forcing them out \"as personal affronts.\"\n\nSome people close to the president believe Kelly\u2019s handling of the East Wing at times is a significant threat to him maintaining his job.\n\n\"There\u2019s one problem John Kelly has that\u2019ll do him in, and that\u2019s the first lady,\" one of them said.\n\nA White House official said the first lady has not pushed for his departure, noting that she likes Kelly personally and gets along with him. But tensions with her office, on top of his intensifying power struggle with Bolton, have reignited speculation that Trump will replace him before the end of the year.\n\nLast month, Kelly got into a heated argument with Bolton on immigration, ultimately storming out of the White House on Oct. 18, NBC News reported last month after learning that Bolton had criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as doing a terrible job on border security,\u00ad an issue of top concern to the president.\n\nNielsen is a close Kelly confidante, and Kelly viewed Bolton\u2019s move as the latest example of the national security adviser circumventing his authority as chief of staff. Trump has been unhappy with Nielsen for months and she has not denied reports that the president has yelled at her in private settings. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that she may also be asked to depart the administration soon.\n\nKelly and Bolton also have clashed over Ricardel, the deputy national security adviser, four people familiar with the issue said. Bolton recently learned that Kelly has quietly mounted an effort to oust Ricardel, these people said, and was furious.\n\nRicardel was among Bolton\u2019s first hires when he became national security adviser in March. She previously worked for him during the administration of former president George W. Bush.\n\nBut at the NSC, Ricardel has gotten into several disputes with the East Wing, also over the First Lady\u2019s trip to Africa in October. One White House official said that in that instance, Kelly intervened on behalf of the East Wing to smooth over the issues.\n\nSome current and former White House officials and other people close to the president said it\u2019s the accumulation of incidents in recent months, on top of Kelly\u2019s tensions with first daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, that has led to a desire by the president to seek out a new chief of staff.\n\nKelly is Trump\u2019s second chief of staff, having replaced Reince Priebus just seven months into the presidency. Kelly left his position as Secretary for Homeland Security in August, 2017 and joined the White House to bring structure to a freewheeling West Wing. He curtailed access to the president and he cut back on the number of staff allowed in meetings. The efforts quickly won him enemies among the president\u2019s confidants.\n\nJohn Kelly speaks to President Donald Trump as he departs the Oval Office on July 18, 2018. Tasos Katopodis / AFP - Getty Images\n\nA retired Marine general, Kelly maintained his job despite a steady flow of reports that he\u2019s lost the confidence of much of the White House staff and has disparaged the president behind his back, NBC has reported.\n\nAs conflicts have arisen, Trump has for months mused on and off about possible replacements for Kelly and vented his frustrations with his handling of the job. The president also arranged for some of his new hires this past spring, including Bolton, to report directly to him rather than his chief of staff.\n\nThe White House has tried to quell speculation about Kelly\u2019s exit, even issuing a statement in July that he would remain in the job through 2020. But few expressed confidence that would be the case.\n\nAyers, who has worked to develop a relationship with Trump as the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, is not the only candidate under consideration in what the three people familiar with the outreach describe as active discussions in the White House about replacing Kelly, possibly by the end of the year. The vice president\u2019s office had no comment on the possibility of the appointment. One White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity said \"personnel decisions don\u2019t mean anything until formally announced by the,\" president. \"Regardless, Nick and those close to him have never lobbied for this.\"\n\nMelania Trump has kept a low profile as first lady and has surrounded herself with a smaller group of aides compared to her predecessors. In a rare, wide-ranging interview with ABC News during her Africa trip, she signaled, however, that she doesn\u2019t hold back in private about her views on her husband\u2019s aides.\n\nThere currently are members of her husband\u2019s staff she does not trust, she said, which makes it \"harder to govern.\"\n\n\"You always need to watch your back,\" she said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Alyssa Newcomb\n\nThe backlash has already begun against Amazon after the e-commerce giant announced Tuesday it will split its second headquarters between New York City and a suburb of Washington, D.C.\n\nCongresswoman-Elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she has received concerned calls from residents in her Queens district, which is adjacent to where the Amazon offices will be located. She characterized the general sentiment about Amazon moving into the area as \u201coutrage.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here,\u201d she tweeted on Monday.\n\nAmazon made the surprise decision to split the second headquarters between two locations after a year-long bidding frenzy that started with proposals from 238 cities. Amazon has said the HQ2 project will include a $5 billion investment and could create as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs, which will be split between the two locations.\n\nWhile city and state leaders rolled out the red carpet to entice Amazon with perks, little is known about the actual incentives that led Amazon to decide to set up a second headquarters in the country\u2019s financial and political capitals.\n\n\u201cNew York and Washington are like other big cities, facing housing poor and rent poor populations,\u201d said Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a national policy group promoting corporate and government accountability in economic development. \"People are spending bigger chunks of their income renting and this is going to only make pressure for housing affordability worse.\"\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to drop 25,000 people making more than $100,000 a year in a hot housing market, it is inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIf local officials are not very intentional about attaching strings to this deal, including affordable housing safeguards and transit improvements, it is going to be very hard\u201d for residents already trying to get by in those cities, he said.\n\nTori Marra, who has been a Long Island City resident for the past seven and a half years, told NBC News she\u2019s cautiously watching the effect Amazon might have on her neighborhood.\n\n\u201cI moved in mid-2011 when Long Island City was very reasonable for rent and still an ideal location,\u201d said Marra. \u201cThis announcement definitely worries me about my future in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nGreg Willett, chief economist at RealPage, a property management software company, said rental prices in Long Island City had been relatively stable but that he expected prices to rise with Amazon's entry.\n\n\"The most immediate impact of Amazon\u2019s announcement likely with be an increase in rent growth, since apartment owners and operators know that sizable future demand is on the way,\" Willett said. \"Neighborhoods within easy commutes of the Amazon locations also should see prices rise.\"\n\nIn addition to traffic congestion and a New York City subway system in dire need of repairs, questions have been raised about the lack of details surrounding the package of incentives that influenced Amazon\u2019s split decision. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo even joked earlier this month that he would be willing to change his name to \"Amazon Cuomo\" if New York won HQ2.\n\nWhile winning investment from one of the world's biggest companies is undoubtedly a feather in the cap for politicians, a coalition of community groups in Northern Virginia has called for transparency and for the process to be slowed down.\n\n\u201cWe oppose a massive state gift to a company headed by the world\u2019s richest person,\u201d the groups said in a joint statement. They also called on local leaders to \u201cfully disclose all of the tax incentives, infrastructure improvements and other subsidies that have been offered for HQ2.\u201d\n\nIn New York, City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer is promoting a \u201cNo to Amazon HQ2 in Long Island City\u201d protest on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe were not elected to serve as Amazon drones,\u201d he said in a joint statement with State Sen. Michael Gianaris. \u201cIt is incumbent upon us to stand up on behalf of the people we represent and that is what we intend to do.\u201d\n\nBut there is an upside of having Amazon come to town.\n\nThe company's investments in Seattle from 2010 to 2016 added $38 billion to the city's economy, according to data provided by Amazon. It\u2019s also great news for property owners. In Seattle and the surrounding area, the housing market has boomed, largely thanks to Amazon employing more than 40,000 high-paid workers in the city.\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the former Governor of Virginia, said he\u2019s \u201creally excited about the potential Amazon offers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've seen that major investments like these can bring not only thousands of direct jobs but also lead to job growth in other industries,\u201d he said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAs we welcome Amazon's new investment in Virginia, we must commit to implementing this announcement in a way that will benefit the whole region and all of the Commonwealth.\u201d", "/ Source: Reuters By Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of international students entering U.S. colleges and universities has fallen for the second year in a row, a nonprofit group said on Tuesday, amid efforts by the Trump administration to tighten restrictions on foreigners studying in the United States.\n\nNew enrollments for the 2017-18 school year slumped 6.6 percent compared with the previous year, according to an annual survey released by the Institute of International Education. That follows a 3.3 percent decline in new international students tallied in the 2016-17 academic year.\n\nSeveral factors are driving the decrease. Visa and immigration policy changes by the Trump administration have deterred some international students from enrolling, college administrators and immigration analysts said.\n\nA strong dollar has made U.S. college tuition relatively more expensive, Canadian and European universities are competing fiercely for the same students and headlines about mass shootings also may have deterred some students, said Allan Goodman, president of IIE.\n\n\"Everything matters from safety, to cost, to perhaps perceptions of visa policy,\" Goodman said. \"We're not hearing that students feel they can't come here. We're hearing that they have choices. We're hearing that there's competition from other countries.\"\n\nInternational students have become an important funding source for American colleges as traditional revenue sources, such as state funding, come under pressure. Most undergraduate foreign students do not qualify for need-based financial aid and must pay close to full tuition and fees to attend U.S. schools.\n\nSimilar to previous years, the largest numbers of students came from China, India and South Korea, which together made up 56.1 percent of all international students.\n\nIIE did not track new international student numbers before the 2004-05 school year, but Goodman said the recent declines in new enrollments were comparable to the period after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The annual survey of foreign-student enrollment is funded by the U.S. State Department.\n\nSome immigration policy experts and college administrators attribute the decline to the Trump administration's drive to restrict immigration and an overall sense of a U.S. political climate that is hostile to immigrants and foreigners.\n\n\"It is not a welcoming environment,\" said Doug Rand, a former White House official working on immigration issues during the Obama administration.\n\nHe noted that Trump has moved to restrict the issuance of skilled-worker visas and permanent residency, which many incoming students may apply for in the future.\n\n\"It's an act of willful ignorance to suggest that our immigration policies aren't having a direct impact on foreign student enrollment,\" Rand said.\n\nCaroline Casagrande, a State Department official, said the \"flattening\" in international student enrollments began with the 2015-2016 year, prior to the start of the Trump administration. That year, new enrollments still increased by 2.4 percent compared with the prior year.\n\n\"The U.S. Department of State is committed to facilitating the legitimate travel to the United States of individuals who want to study in U.S. academic institutions,\" Casagrande said during a phone call with reporters. \"It's quite frankly unwarranted to say that it is completely the result of a political environment.\"\n\nCary Jensen, assistant vice provost for international advocacy and engagement at the University of Rochester in New York, said international students had been receiving more scrutiny from the U.S. government since the Sept. 11 attacks, but that \"this last year and a half has just taken it to another level.\"\n\nJensen said a major issue facing American universities was the lack of clarity surrounding the Trump administration's policies, in part due to lengthy court battles over policies like Trump's travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\"That has kind of been the worst part of this, is the uncertainty,\" Jensen said. \"That breeds fear and people tend to overreact.\"\n\nThe administration is pursuing concrete steps to restrict visa policy regarding international students. Last month, it said it would seek to establish a fixed maximum period of stay for international students. Students currently can stay for an indefinite duration of study, and exchange advocates worry such a change would make it harder to recruit students and limit their flexibility once they are in the country.\n\nIn August, the administration changed the way international and exchange visitors are found to accrue \"unlawful presence,\" a violation that could result in being barred from the country for up to 10 years. Several colleges sued over the change, arguing it would cause the \"banishment of untold numbers of international students and exchange visitors acting in good faith.\"\n\nThe total number of new international students in the United States in 2017-2018 grew by 1.5 percent to a record high of nearly 1.1 million, but it was the smallest year-over-year increase since 2005. The growth in total enrollment was driven by a nearly 16 percent increase in the number of students opting to remain in the United States after finishing their studies for short-term work known as \"optional practical training.\"\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr.", "DATELINE WEEKEND MYSTERY PREVIEW: The Face of Evil copied!\n\nWhen 21-year-old student is found murdered along a Texas road, detectives begin to hunt for her killer.

North Korea \"has never signed any agreement, any negotiation that makes shutting down missile bases mandatory.\"\n\nThe 13 undeclared North Korean missile operating bases were identified Monday by Beyond Parallel, a program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS. The researchers at the Washington think tank said they believe there are at least another seven they haven't yet found.\n\nThese are not launch sites, but rather mostly mountainous locations where missiles, warheads, launchers and personnel are stationed, ready to be deployed elsewhere in the event of an attack.\n\nLater Monday, U.S. officials told NBC News that the North is continuing development of its weapons program.\n\nThe controversy is not over the CSIS report itself but how it has been characterized in the media.\n\nAlthough the South Korean spokesman said there was \"nothing new\" in the research, he went on to suggest it was \"more detailed\" than information obtained by his own government and even Washington.\n\nMany experts say the research is valuable in that it confirms unverified reports that had been long circulated among analysts. They also say that it definitively debunks Trump's claims that \"total denuclearization ... has already started,\" as the president put it last Thursday.\n\nThe bases show \"how far the reality ... diverges from the claim that the negotiations have already succeeded,\" Sue Mi Terry, a senior fellow at CSIS, tweeted.\n\nThe CSIS report drew few if any political conclusions, noting only that the missile sites would likely have to be dismantled as part of any Kim-Trump deal.\n\nA Digital Globe satellite image taken on March 29, 2018 shows what the Washington, D.C.-based CSIS reports is an undeclared missile operating base at Sakkanmol, North Korea. CSIS/Beyond Parallel/DigitalGlobe 2018 via Reuters\n\nHowever, there was criticism of the way the report had been portrayed in the news, namely the New York Times' assertion that the findings showed a \"great deception\" by North Korea.\n\n\"There is a phrase, 'great deception,' used in articles, but North Korea has never promised to shut down this missile base,\" said Kim, the South Korean spokesman, referring to one of the facilities, Sakkanmol, mentioned by CSIS. \"It has never signed any agreement, any negotiation that makes shutting down missile bases mandatory.\"\n\nNot only has North Korea never pledged to abandon these sites described in the report, it has never pledged to acknowledge they exist, the spokesman reminded.\n\nIn June, Trump and Kim signed an agreement that pledged to \"work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nExperts said this was very vague, with no detail on how \"denuclearization\" should happen or what the word even means (the U.S. and North Korea have different ideas).\n\n\"There were no specifics or written commitments for detailed scheduling over what to do with North Korea's weapons of mass destruction,\" said Go Myong Hyun, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, a think tank in Seoul, South Korea. \"It was a loosely worded joint agreement.\"\n\nSince then, negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea have stuttered.\n\nMany observers, including the CIA, believe that Kim has no intention of ever giving up his nuclear weapons. His negotiators, the argument goes, are continuing talks with the U.S. and South Korea in the hope of getting other concessions along the way.\n\nTrump has often taken credit for North Korea halting tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\n\nIn his new-year's address this January, the young dictator Kim offered a different explanation. He said that North Korea had done all the the testing it needs; now was the time to build up its arsenal.\n\n\"The nuclear weapons research sector and the rocket industry should mass-produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles, the power and reliability of which have already been proved to the full,\" he said.\n\nIn this sense, North Korea continuing production at a network of secret bases should come as little surprise. It's exactly what Kim said he would do.\n\nStella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea; Alexander Smith reported from London.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Bill Nelson, who trails Republican Rick Scott, in the Senate contest.\n\nSnipes told reporters, \"I don't have a treasure trove for going out digging on the beach or somewhere to find any votes.\"\n\nSnipes, who has been at the center of controversy over her handling of the close Senate and governor's contests, insisted the heavily Democratic county will complete its recount by the Thursday deadline, despite several delays.\n\n\"There\u2019s never been a deadline that we have missed,\" Snipes told reporters.\n\nAnd Snipes, who is African-American, noted that her office has faced more scrutiny than others, even though Broward is not the only place in Florida with election issues.\n\n\"It\u2019s sort of hard to rule out race, but I won't say, 'Oh, I'm a black woman and that's why.' I'm not saying that,\" she said.\n\nSnipes has defiantly weathered plenty of criticism in her 15 years on the job, but suggested she may not be long for it \u2014 even though she just won reelection to another four-year term in 2016.\n\n\"It is time to move on, to let someone else,\" she said. \"I think I have served the purpose that I came her for.\"\n\nAsked to clarify if that meant she would resign or not run for reelection, Snipes said she would complete the recount and then figure out her next move. \"I haven't finalized that. I\u2019ll just check with my family \u2014 they\u2019ll tell me what I\u2019m doing,\" she said.\n\nWhen county elections officials start drawing national attention, it's generally because something has gone very wrong.\n\nThat's the situation for Snipes, who has faced angry protests outside her office from Trump supporters baring signs demanding her imprisonment.\n\nIt's not the first time Snipes has found herself at the center of controversy or faced accusations of incompetence and wrongdoing, but the stakes have never been so high.\n\nSnipes spent most of her career as a public school teacher and principal and only got into election administration after her the previous officeholder was ousted following a botched 2002 gubernatorial primary, which followed the disastrous 2000 presidential recount.\n\nSnipes was appointed to clean up the county's election system in 2003 by a Republican, former Gov. Jeb Bush, who was sensitive to the politics of removing her black Democratic predecessor in the heavily Democratic county.\n\nSnipes went on to win reelection four times, including most recently in 2016, always by wide margins.\n\nNow, Bush has now joined other Republicans in calling for Snipes' removal from office, saying on Twitter that she \"failed to comply with Florida law on multiple counts, undermining Floridians' confidence in our electoral process.\"\n\nBush is hardly alone in his criticism, and it's not just coming from Republicans. Florida media outlets have uncovered numerous election administration issues over many years and the editorial board of the Sun Sentinel, the largest newspaper in Broward County, called on her to resign.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., told Politico that Broward County is \"not just the most troubled elections office in the state, it's the most troubled elections office in the nation.\"\n\nEven some Democrats here say privately that while they admire Snipes' decades of dedication to her community, her competence at the nitty gritty work of election administration leaves something to be desired. A Democrat even ran against her in a primary 2016, citing her office's past issues, but he lost badly.\n\nA judge earlier this year ruled that Snipes' office had broken the law by not preserving ballots as long as they were required following the 2016 election.\n\nThat year, her office left a referendum on medical marijuana off some ballots. And before that, it accidentally posted the results of the presidential primary before polls closed \u2014 a big no no since early returns becoming public can influence voters who have yet to cast their ballots. And in 2012, nearly 1,000 uncounted ballots were discovered a week after the election.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened in Broward,\" Broward County Commissioner Ilene Lieberman said at the time.\n\nDuring this year's recount, Snipes has been criticized for not giving up-to-date information on how many ballots remain uncounted and for processing 22 voided ballots that were accidentally mixed in with valid ones.\n\nBroward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, right, shows a ballot box that was found in a rental car after the elections and turned out to only contain election day supplies, as election employees sort ballots and prepare to count them on Nov. 12, 2018, in Lauderhill, Florida. Wilfredo Lee / AP\n\nBut most critically for the recount, a poorly designed ballot has put Snipes' office at the center of the recount controversy.\n\nNelson's only hope to make up his roughly 12,500-vote deficit behind Scott could rest with that ballot, which Democrats' hope was misread by machines on election night.\n\nAdd to that the fact that Broward is one of Florida\u2019s most populous and most heavily Democratic counties, and it's easy to see why Republicans have focused so much attention on Snipes.\n\nStill, their most explosive claims against her have fizzled. For instance, empty boxes that some on social media said contained uncounted ballots turned out to hold nothing but supplies like clipboards and \"Vote Here\" signs.\n\nA Broward County judge on Monday reiterated that he had seen no evidence of voter fraud, as Trump and others had claimed, asking attorneys to present some evidence before continuing their rhetoric about it.\n\nAnd Snipes has plenty of defenders, as evident by her easy victories.\n\n\"She's a woman full of integrity, and I'm sure that's why Jeb Bush appointed her,\" said Grace Carrington, a Democratic Committee National committeewoman who knows her. \"He's a Republican, so if he didn't have confidence in her, I don\u2019t believe he would have done that.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Amazon already had sizable offices in both cities.\n\nAmazon said it will hire more than 25,000 employees in each location, and open an \"Operations Center of Excellence\" in Nashville that will include more than 5,000 jobs.\n\nThe three developments include sizable tax incentives for Amazon, which the company projected could hit $2.2 billion.\n\nThe announcement came after an intense pitch process in which an initial list of bids from more than 230 cities was whittled down to 20 finalists in January. Amazon had previously said it would choose one location for \"HQ2,\" as the project came to be known.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to build new headquarters in New York City and Northern Virginia,\u201d Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive officer of Amazon, said in the company's announcement. \u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come. The team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities.\u201d\n\nWhile the project was initially greeted with a wave of optimism from politicians and city officials who hoped to attract Amazon's investment, the decision to split the headquarters between two of the country's richest cities has resulted in growing skepticism around Amazon and the entire HQ2 process.\n\n\u201cAmazon extracting highly favorable terms, only to halve its promise and expect those same terms, is an exercise of bargaining power that will be familiar to many of the millions of merchants reliant on Amazon\u2019s platform,\u201d tweeted Lina Khan, a senior fellow with the Open Markets Institute, a think tank that studies monopoly power.\n\nIn Long Island City, Amazon said it expects to receive $1.5 billion in tax incentives for the 4 million square feet of office space and thousands of employees the company projects for its new headquarters. The company said the economic impact of the office will generate more than $10 billion in tax revenue over the next 20 years.\n\nIn Arlington, Amazon said it expects to receive $573 million in incentives for the same investment. The company said that office would generate $3.2 billion in tax revenue in the same time period.\n\nAmazon said hiring for the new offices is scheduled to begin in 2019.\n\nBill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, touted Amazon's investment but also said the state of New York and the city \"are working closely together to make sure Amazon\u2019s expansion is planned smartly, and to ensure this fast growing neighborhood has the transportation, schools, and infrastructure it needs.\u201d\n\nGov. Ralph Northam of Virginia said Amazon's investment was a \"big win\" and that its partnership with Amazon would include \"investments in our education and transportation infrastructure that will bolster the features that make Virginia so attractive: a strong and talented workforce, a stable and competitive business climate, and a world-class higher education system.\u201d\n\nThe smaller Nashville office will include an investment of $230 million and use 1 million square feet of office space, which Amazon said would create tax revenue of $1 billion over the next 10 years. Amazon said the city agreed to tax incentives of up to $102 million.\n\nAmazon started the well-publicized search for its second headquarters in September 2017, announcing that it was on the hunt for a location outside of its Seattle home to accommodate 50,000 workers. The company listed a variety of conditions for prospective host cities including a business-friendly tax environment, a growing workforce and proximity to a major airport.\n\nCompetition for the new campus was fierce, driven by hopes of enjoying the economic benefits of having one of the world's most valuable companies set up shop in town. According to data provided by Amazon, the company's investments in Seattle from 2010 to 2016 added $38 billion to the city's economy.\n\nAmazon said its second headquarters would include an investment of up to $5 billion.\n\nThe decision to pick Washington was applauded by Steve Case, the co-founder of AOL who now runs venture capital firm Revolution, though he also noted that smaller cities that were not chosen by Amazon should not be discouraged.\n\n\"I hope those cities will view this not as the end, but as a new beginning,\" Case wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. \"The coalitions they formed and the plans they made in creating a bid for Amazon's HQ2 can be repurposed to strengthen the startup sector in their cities.\"", "By Associated Press\n\nMATIAS ROMERO, Mexico \u2014 Dozens of transgender women and gay men in the caravan moving through Mexico with hopes of seeking asylum in the United States have banded together for protection \u2014 not from the uncertainty of a journey fraught with danger from the gangs who prey on migrants but from their fellow travelers.\n\nFleeing violence and discrimination back home because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, these LGBTQ migrants have found the journey north to be just as threatening amid catcalls and even physical abuse.\n\n\"Sweet little thing!\" ''Baby, where you going?\" ''How much do you charge?\" These all-too-familiar jeers are spewed at them as they make their way with the caravan of several thousand.\n\nTwo transgender women apply makeup at a shelter in Cordoba, Mexico on Nov. 4, 2018.

Rodrigo Abd / AP\n\nReports are common in much of Central America of LGBTQ people being murdered, assaulted and discriminated against, due to their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nBut getting U.S. asylum is difficult even with proof someone has been the victim of persecution for being transgender, said Lynly Egyes, director of litigation at the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, California.\n\nIt often takes days or weeks for transgender immigrants to get a hearing before an asylum officer. If they are allowed to move forward in the process, many are traumatized and struggle to tell their story, Egyes said. They are also much less likely to be granted asylum without a lawyer.\n\n\"It is a horrifying process, and not everybody makes it through,\" she said.\n\nIn this Nov. 2, 2018 photo, members of the LGBTQ community who are traveling with the Central American migrants caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, wait on the side of the road for a ride to Donaji, Mexico.

The 50 or so LGBTQ migrants traveling together, most of them in their 20s but some as young as 17 or as old as 60, say they, too, banded together for safety \u2014 a sort of caravan within the caravan.\n\nSticking out in their bright-colored clothing and makeup, the group has suffered verbal harassment, especially from men, and has been the victim of robbery and other aggressions. One recent day as they walked in a row on the highway to Isla, in the Mexican Gulf coast state of Veracruz, a group of fellow migrants passed by on a flatbed truck and showered them with water, oranges, rinds and other refuse.\n\nFearful of being attacked more violently or sexually assaulted, they stick by each other's sides 24 hours a day, walking and sleeping in a group and even using the buddy system for going to the bathroom.\n\nIn this Nov. 1, 2018 photo, Valentina Guerrero, of El Salvador, right, and Sinai Cortez, from Nicaragua, center, part of about 50 LGBTQ migrants who are traveling with the caravan hoping to reach the U.S. border, wait their turn to use a portable toilet at a temporary shelter in Donaji, Mexico.

There isn't one for us.\"\n\nFlotte was accompanying the migrants to provide support and information about making asylum claims.\n\nThe U.S. \"should take into account their condition of vulnerability and violence,\" she said.\n\nIn this Nov. 3, 2018 photo, Mexican transgender and activist Nakai Flotte, center front holding a flower print backpack, listens to caravan leaders during a morning meeting, in Sayula, Mexico.

It's unclear how many will make it.

Rodrigo Abd / AP\n\nMuch of the trek has been on foot, but hitching rides in pickup trucks, minibuses and tractor-trailers has been crucial lately, especially on days when they travel 100 miles or more. For the LGBTQ group, it's been tougher to find those rides.\n\n\"A taxi driver kicked us out of his car,\" said Lady Perez, a 23-year-old from Honduras, adding that sometimes truck drivers who often transport migrants for a small fee have doubled or tripled the price for her group.\n\nLady began identifying as transgender at age 5, and her father ultimately disowned her. She was subjected to insults and beatings, her boyfriend was killed and she was warned to leave Honduras or else.\n\n\"In our country the rights of the LGBTQ community are not respected, and anti-social groups take advantage of that,\" Lady said.\n\nA member of the group looks at polaroid photos documenting their journey on the road to Sayula, Mexico, on Nov. 3, 2018.

Secret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown,\" the president said on Twitter, while also complaining people didn't report on his Sunday speech during the rain.\n\nTrump's rainy Sunday speech was widely reported, but his attacks on France \u2014 including a tweet that proposed modifying wine tariffs \u2014 come after the president faced international criticism for both his self-declared nationalism and Saturday's cancelled cemetery visit. Tuesday also marks the anniversary of the devastating terror attacks across Paris three years ago.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel traveled a similar distance by car to another commemorative event, and White House chief of staff John Kelly and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did make the roughly 50-mile long drive that Trump now says the Secret Service barred him from joining.\n\nIn his tweets, the president continued to upbraid Macron for calling for a \"true European army\" in a radio interview prior to Trump's arrival in Paris Friday, and pushed back on Macron's declaration that \"nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism.\"He alsosuggested Macron's remarks were an attempt to distract from his low approval ratings in the country.\n\nSpeaking steps from Trump and 80 other world leaders on Sunday, Macron said: \u201cBy saying, \u2018Our interests first, who cares about the others,\u2019 we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what gives it grace and what is essential: its moral values.\"\n\nHis speech was interpreted by many as a rebuke to Trump, who proudly declared himself a \"nationalist\" on the campaign trail in October.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the French president's office said it refuses to comment on Trump's tweets criticizing France and Macron.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly two years in office, President Trump has remade the Republican Party in his own image. Case in point is in Arizona, where Trump\u2019s rhetoric, hard anti-immigration policies and his tweets forced Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., to announce he wouldn\u2019t seek re-election a year ago. \u201cThere may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party,\u201d Flake said back then. Trump also made no bones about his dislike for the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\n\nWhat happened last night? Well, the Senate seat that Flake gave up is now in Democratic hands, with NBC News declaring Kyrsten Sinema the apparent winner over Republican Martha McSally in the race to succeed Flake. The call for Sinema came after she extended her lead over McSally by more than 38,000 votes.\n\nSinema becomes the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate race in Arizona since 1988.\n\nAnd Arizona isn\u2019t the only place where Trump\u2019s beefs with other Republicans ended up costing his party. In June, the president attacked Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C. and endorsed his primary opponent Katie Arrington \u2013 which helped defeat Sanford. What happened last week? Democrat Joe Cunningham beat Arrington, flipping that Charleston-area congressional seat to the Democrats.\n\nAnd in August, Trump endorsed Kris Kobach over incumbent GOP Gov. Jeff Colyer \u2014 and Kobach narrowly won that primary. What happened last week? Well, Democrat Laura Kelly beat Kobach, giving Dems one of their most impressive wins in a red state. (And Kobach now could become Trump\u2019s new Homeland Security secretary; more on that below.)\n\nTo be sure, Trump\u2019s spat with retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., didn\u2019t cost the GOP; Republican Marsha Blackburn easily won that Senate race. And two of the president\u2019s other high-profile endorsements \u2014 Ron DeSantis in Florida and Brian Kemp in Georgia \u2014 won or lead in their marquee gubernatorial races, though NBC News has yet to call the GA-GOV contest. But does anyone else think that the other Republicans in those races (Adam Putnam in Florida, Casey Cagle in Georgia) might have had an easier path in winning?\n\nTrump made it clear that there was no place for Republicans like Jeff Flake, John McCain, Mark Sanford and even Jeff Colyer in his Republican Party. And that ended up costing the GOP races in Arizona, South Carolina and Kansas.\n\n\u201cSo after all of Trump\u2019s gleefulness about how he personally hounded Jeff Flake out of office, Republicans ended up losing Flake\u2019s seat,\u201d the Toronto Star\u2019s Daniel Dale tweeted.\n\nWho made the smarter bet: Democrats playing to the middle or Republicans focused on the base?\n\nWe found our answer in Arizona: We used the Arizona Senate race as the chief example in posing this question: Which party made the smarter bet \u2014 Democrats focused on the middle of the electorate, or Trump/Republicans playing to the base? Well, we have our answer in Arizona.\n\nSinema\u2019s message was aimed squarely at independents and disaffected Republicans (remember when she wouldn\u2019t say if she was a \u201cproud Democrat\u201d), while McSally stayed to the right during the three-way GOP primary and pretty much stayed there for the general election against Sinema.\n\nAnother way to look at it: Sinema (who focused on the middle) won the Senate race in Arizona, while fellow Dem David Garcia (who focused on a progressive message) lost by double digits in the gubernatorial contest.\n\nThe uncalled Senate races (1)\n\n-- AZ-SEN (Sinema declared the apparent winner)\n\nFL-SEN (Scott leads Nelson by 12,562 votes as the contest heads to a manual recount)\n\n(MS-SEN goes to runoff)\n\nThe uncalled GOV races (1)\n\nGA-GOV (GOPer Brian Kemp remains at 50.3 percent)\n\nThe uncalled House races (10)\n\nCA-10 (Dem Josh Harder leads Republican Jeff Denham, 51 percent to 49 percent)\n\nCA-39 (GOPer Young Kim leads Dem Gil Cisernos, 51 percent to 49 percent)\n\nCA-45 (GOPer Mimi Walters leads Dem Katie Porter, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent)\n\nCA-48 (Dem Harley Rouda has declared victory; he leads, 52 percent to 48 percent)\n\n-- CA-49 (Dem Mike Levin is the apparent winner)\n\nGA-7 (GOPer Rob Woodall is ahead, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent)\n\nME-2 (it appears the race is headed to ranked choice to determine the winner)\n\nNM-2 (NBC News retracted its earlier call in favor of the Republicans; Dem Xochitl Torres Small is ahead, 51 percent to 49 percent)\n\nNC-9 (GOPer Mark Harris is ahead, 49.4 percent to 48.8 percent)\n\nNJ-3 (Dem Andy Kim is ahead, 49.9 percent to 48.8 percent)\n\nUT-4 (Dem Ben McAdams is ahead, 51.2 percent to 48.8 percent)\n\nWaPo: Nielsen might be out as Homeland Security secretary\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has told advisers he has decided to remove Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, and her departure from the administration is likely to occur in the coming weeks, if not sooner, according to five current and former White House officials,\u201d the Washington Post writes. \u201cTrump canceled a planned trip with Nielsen this week to visit U.S. troops at the border in South Texas and told aides over the weekend that he wants her out as soon as possible, these officials said. The president has grumbled for months about what he views as Nielsen\u2019s lackluster performance on immigration enforcement and is believed to be looking for a replacement who will implement his policy ideas with more alacrity.\u201d\n\nWho might replace Nielsen? Trump \u201ccould name one of the agency\u2019s other Senate-confirmed principals, such as Kevin Mc\u00adAleenan, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or David P. Pekoske, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration and a former vice commandant of the Coast Guard\u2026 Kris Kobach\u2019s loss in the Kansas governor\u2019s race has generated speculation that Trump could attempt to nominate him as a replacement for Nielsen, but Kobach, Kansas\u2019s secretary of state, remains a polarizing figure whose hard-line views \u2014 especially on immigration \u2014 are considered by many observers to be too extreme to win Senate confirmation.\u201d\n\nMaryland asks judge to declare Rosenstein acting attorney general\n\nNBC\u2019s Pete Williams: \u201cThe state of Maryland plans to ask a federal judge on Tuesday for an order declaring that Rod Rosenstein is the acting attorney general \u2014 not Matt Whitaker, who was appointed to that position last week after the forced resignation of Jeff Sessions. If the judge does as Maryland asks, ruling that Whitaker cannot serve as attorney general, it would be a blow to President Donald Trump, who bypassed Rosenstein in favor of someone who has repeatedly criticized Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian election meddling.

And, for counties with 100 or more provisional ballots, she ordered the secretary of state's office to review, or have county election officials review, the eligibility of voters who had to cast a provisional ballot because of registration issues.\n\nTotenberg also ruled that Georgia must not certify the election results before Friday at 5 p.m., which falls before the Nov. 20 deadline set by state law.\n\nState elections director Chris Harvey testified at a hearing last week that the state had planned to certify the election results on Wednesday, a day after the deadline for counties to certify their results. He said that would allow preparations to begin for any necessary runoff contests, including one already projected in the race for the next secretary of state.\n\nCurrent unofficial returns show Republican Brian Kemp leading by a margin that would make him the governor-elect. But Democrat Stacey Abrams insists that enough outstanding votes remain to be counted that could pull Kemp below the majority threshold and force a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nTotenberg acted in response to a lawsuit filed Nov. 5 by Common Cause Georgia. The suit accuses Kemp, the state's top elections official until he resigned as secretary of state last week, of acting recklessly after a vulnerability in Georgia's voter registration database was exposed shortly before the election.\n\nKemp's actions increased the risk that eligible voters could be illegally removed from the voter registration database or have registration information illegally altered, the lawsuit says.\n\nSara Henderson, executive director of Common Cause Georgia, said in an emailed statement that the ruling helps increase voter confidence in elections.\n\nThe secretary of state's office was reviewing the order and considering its options, spokeswoman Candice Broce said in an email.\n\nTotenberg's order doesn't change the Tuesday deadline for counties to certify their results. But Abrams' campaign filed a lawsuit Sunday asking a federal court to push that deadline to Wednesday, while also requiring that elections authorities count certain provisional and absentee ballots that have been or would be rejected for \"arbitrary reasons.\"\n\n\"I am fighting to make sure our democracy works for and represents everyone who has ever put their faith in it. I am fighting for every Georgian who cast a ballot with the promise that their vote would count,\" Abrams said in a statement explaining her refusal to end her bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history.\n\nKemp's campaign retorted that Abrams' latest effort is \"a disgrace to democracy\" and ignores mathematical realities.\n\n\"Clearly, Stacey Abrams isn't ready for her 15 minutes of fame to end,\" said Kemp spokesman Ryan Mahoney.\n\nAs of Monday evening, a hearing had not been scheduled for arguments in the case, but Abrams' campaign was expecting a federal court in Atlanta to set a Tuesday hearing, given the time sensitivity.\n\nUnofficial returns show Kemp with a lead of about 60,000 votes out of more than 3.9 million cast; Abrams would need a net gain of about 21,000 votes to force a Dec. 4 runoff. NBC has rated the race too close to call at this time.\n\nThe Georgia race, along with Florida's gubernatorial and Senate matchups that are requiring recounts, are among the final measures of a midterm election cycle that already has allowed Democrats to deal serious blows to President Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats already have won the House, flipped seven governor's seats and reclaimed more than 300 state legislative seats in statehouses around the country. The GOP maintained its Senate majority, and could still expand it. But it's looking to hold the governor's mansions in Florida and Georgia to deny Democrats important gains in presidential battlegrounds ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nRepublicans have been governor in Georgia since 2003 and in Florida since 1999, and Trump has put a premium on the two states, endorsing both Kemp and Florida's GOP nominee Ron DeSantis when they were in competitive GOP primaries and then campaigning in person for them ahead of the Nov. 6 election.\n\nGeorgia's interim Secretary of State Robyn Crittenden on Monday directed county officials to count some provisional ballots that had been rejected because of voters' failure to provide their year of birth, provided the voter's identity and eligibility was still established.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the State Election Board asked Crittenden to send a letter instructing county election officials how to handle absentee ballots.\n\nRepublican Gov. Nathan Deal appointed Crittenden to replace Kemp, who resigned last week after declaring victory in the governor's race. He called his margin \u2014 50.3 percent of the vote \u2014 \"clear and convincing,\" but said he wanted Georgians to have confidence in the certification process.\n\nCrittenden's directive was in line with one form of relief sought by the Abrams campaign lawsuit but rejected another.\n\nWhen casting absentee ballots, voters have to sign an oath and have to write their address and year of birth. The lawsuit asked the judge to order that county election officials accept any absentee ballots on which there was missing or insufficient oath information as long as that doesn't \"substantially obstruct\" officials from verifying the absentee voter's identity.\n\nThe lawsuit says that at least 1,095 qualified voters who cast absentee ballots in Gwinnett County had them \"arbitrarily and unlawfully rejected\" because of missing or insufficient information.\n\nUnder Georgia law, any issues causing a voter to cast a provisional ballot must be remedied within three days of the election \u2014 Nov. 9 for this election. The lawsuit asks that county election officials be required to consider evidence proving eligibility through Wednesday at 5 p.m.\n\nCrittenden's guidance to the counties noted that the Nov. 9 deadline for verifying the eligibility of provisional ballots was set by state law.\n\nThe lawsuit also asked that provisional ballots cast by a voter registered in another county be counted as if the voter had shown up at the wrong precinct. The lawsuit says that of the 1,556 provisional ballots Fulton County reported having rejected by Nov. 9, nearly 1,000 were disqualified because they were cast by voters whose registration records showed them registered in another county.\n\nFurther, the Abrams' campaign is asking that any of the court's orders in the case be applied retroactively to counties that already have certified their returns, meaning those counties would have to reopen their counting process using any new standards and then submit updated returns to the state.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It had looked set to derail international efforts to broker a long-term truce and head off another major conflict in the impoverished and blockaded enclave where some 70 percent of Gaza's population are refugees or descendants of refugees, and a similar proportion depends on humanitarian aid.\n\nThe recent uptick in violence followed months of fires caused by hundreds of incendiary kites and explosive balloons sent from Gaza, as well as often violent protests by Palestinians along the fence with Israel. Israeli officials have struggled to deal with blazes set by incendiary devices that have burned thousands of acres of nature reserves and farm lands.\n\nThe Israeli raid into Gaza Sunday left seven militants dead, including a local Hamas commander. An Israeli army officer was also killed during the incursion by Israeli special forces.\n\nPalestinian militants have launched 460 rockets or mortar bombs across the border after carrying out a surprise guided-missile attack Monday on an Israeli bus that wounded a soldier, the Israeli military said.\n\nHamas \u2014 which has controlled Gaza since 2007 and is considered a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. \u2014 and other armed factions fired rockets at the Israeli city of Ashkelon, some eight miles from the Gaza border, as well as at other border communities.\n\nA 40-year-old man was killed when a rocket hit a residential building in Ashkelon, according to Magen David Adom, Israel\u2019s national emergency service.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Force said that as of 6 p.m. (11 a.m. ET), more than 160 targets in Gaza had been hit, among them Hamas government buildings and its television station.\n\nOvernight, the Israeli Defense Forces claimed responsibility for an airstrike that destroyed the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV station in Gaza.

He added both sides' displays of strength also served to appease factions within their own constituencies who were not happy about truce talks.\n\nAs for whether the violence would continue, Mekelberg said it would depend on unpredictable factors such as numbers of casualties and what targets were hit.\n\nHe said the international community should intervene but criticized Greenblatt\u2019s tweets blaming Hamas. \u201cAt this point the most important thing is to put every effort to stop the vicious cycle of violence,\u201d he said.\n\nPalestinians gather near the remains of a building that was completely destroyed by an Israeli air strike, in Gaza City on Tuesday.

Restaurants are seizing on the increases to promote hamburgers instead of chicken, while grocery stores have featured pork.\n\nThe shift is set to end an unprecedented streak of 27 profitable quarters for chicken producers such as Tyson Foods, which reports results on Tuesday, and Sanderson Farms, said Bill Roenigk, an agricultural economist and consultant for the National Chicken Council trade group. He said the chicken sector would generally lose money or break even in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nThe pain for chicken producers and the increased appetite for pork are ripple effects of Trump's trade disputes, which have also reduced shipments of U.S. soybeans and sorghum to China.\n\n\"With all that pork on the market,\" Roenigk said, \"it has spilled over to affecting consumers' demand for chicken.\"\n\nPork prices have fallen as retaliatory duties of 62 percent in China and up to 20 percent in Mexico have curtailed U.S. exports to those countries.\n\nKraft Heinz Co, which owns the Oscar Mayer brand, has cut prices for bacon after pork belly prices declined. Ahold Delhaize's Food Lion and Stop & Shop grocery stores have offered deals and launched marketing campaigns for pork, said Jarrod Sutton, a vice president for the National Pork Board, a trade group. Food Lion said it offers promotions based on product availability.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture projects per capita chicken consumption will rise only about 1.2 percent next year, compared to gains of 4.3 percent for pork and 2.6 percent for beef.\n\nPromotions at restaurants such as Wendy's, which is featuring a \"S'Awesome\" hamburger with three strips of bacon, are helping to fuel pork and beef demand, according to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, an industry group.\n\nWendy's said it generally does not adjust marketing based on short-term changes in commodity prices.\n\nYet, quick-service restaurant chains released 54 new hamburgers through September this year, up about a third from last year, according to a survey of about 75 chains by Datassential, which analyzes menu trends. Releases of chicken products fell 14 percent, said Datassential, which also reported a decline in new pork dishes.\n\nThe slowdown in chicken consumption is a turnaround for meat companies. Tyson is building a $300 million plant to process 1.25 million more birds a week after struggling to keep up with chicken demand last year. In July, the company, which also sells beef and pork, cut its 2018 profit forecast, citing uncertainty in trade policies.\n\nMexico slapped tariffs on imports of U.S. pork after Washington implemented duties on imports of aluminum and steel. Both sides maintain their tariffs despite a recent trade deal by the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n\nImplementation of those trade agreements should help boost pork exports and push Americans back to chicken, said Bill Lovette, chief executive of Pilgrim's Pride Corp. The chicken company, owned mostly by JBS, reported third-quarter net sales fell 3.4 percent to $2.7 billion.\n\nSanderson Farms, the third-biggest U.S. poultry producer, reports earnings in December.\n\n\"The shift from chicken to beef and pork has been far more pronounced than anyone had imagined,\" said Heather Jones, managing director for investment firm Vertical Group.\n\nLower demand this month pushed prices for U.S. chicken breasts to their lowest weekly average on record, according to an index from food-service company ArrowStream.\n\nChicken supplies in cold storage facilities reached a record at more than 959 million pounds at the end of September, according to USDA data. Beef and pork supplies in cold storage were about 2 percent and 10 percent below records set in 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\nRefrigerated storage company Lineage Logistics said meat was backing up near major U.S. ports due to tariffs, and it projected that rising meat supplies would create a shortage of storage space.\n\nKerry Wilson, a Florida mom, is taking advantage of the increase in beef and pork supplies. She said she grew tired of chicken after preparing it for up to four nights a week and finds pork has more flavor.\n\n\"I can't gussy it up enough anymore,\" she said of chicken. \"It just seems to be the same taste.\"", "By Nicole Acevedo\n\nAuthor and History Channel host Brad Meltzer features the first Latinx icon in his New York Times bestselling series titled Ordinary People Change the World, which highlights about a dozen historical figures and the personality traits kids can emulate if they aspire to live heroic lives.\n\nMeltzer penned \u201cI Am Sonia Sotomayor,\u201d a nonfiction picture book that details the life of the first Latina Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was born in the Bronx to a Puerto Rican mother.\n\n\u201cOur No. 1 request these days is \u2018When are you doing a Hispanic hero?\u2019 Well, here you go,\u201d announced Meltzer on his Facebook page ahead of the book\u2019s release on Tuesday.\n\nIn the book, readers get a glimpse of Sotomayor in every stage of her life \u2014 from the little girl who grew up in a bicultural household, speaking Spanish with her \u2018abuela' and reading Nancy Drew detective books and the Encyclopedia Britannica, to the young woman who later attended Yale Law School on a full scholarship and was ultimately nominated and confirmed as the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.\n\n\u201cI wanted someone who you could look up to regardless of color, especially now,\u201d Meltzer told NBC News. \u201cThe reason why I write these stories is because we all know how it is to feel like an outsider.\u201d\n\nSneak peek at \"I am Sonia Sotomayor,\" a picture book written by Brad Meltzer.

Presidential Press Service / AP\n\nPrince Mohammed won support on Tuesday from U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, who said he did not think recordings of the killing shared by Turkey implicated the young crown prince.\n\nErdogan told reporters on his plane returning from a weekend visit to France that he discussed the Saudi journalist's killing with the U.S., French and German leaders at dinner in Paris.\n\n\"We played the recordings regarding this murder to everyone who wanted them from us. Our intelligence organization did not hide anything. We played them to all who wanted them including the Saudis, the USA, France, Canada, Germany, Britain,\" he said.\n\n\"The recordings are really appalling. Indeed when the Saudi intelligence officer listened to the recordings he was so shocked he said: 'This one must have taken heroin, only someone who takes heroin would do this,'\" he added.\n\nKhashoggi's killing has provoked global outrage but little concrete action by world powers against Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and a supporter of Washington's plans to contain Iranian influence across the Middle East.\n\nBolton said he did not think that people who heard the recordings concluded that the crown prince was linked to the killing. \"And certainly that is not the position of the Saudi government,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nAsked again if the audio tape provided by Turkey did not link Prince Mohammed to the killing in any way, Bolton said: \"I haven\u2019t listened to the tape myself but in the assessment of those who have listened to it, that is right.\"\n\nBolton shares with Saudi Arabia a hawkish stance against Riyadh's biggest Middle East rival Iran, and he championed Washington's resumption of sanctions on the Islamic Republic.\n\nOn the plane, Erdogan said it was clear the murder was planned and that the order came from the top level of Saudi authorities but that he could not think such a thing of King Salman, for whom he has \"limitless respect.\"\n\n\"The crown prince says 'I will clarify the matter, I will do what is necessary.' We are waiting patiently,\" Erdogan said, adding that the perpetrators of the killing were among 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"It must be revealed who gave them the order to murder.\"\n\nTurkey's pro-government newspaper Sabah reported on Tuesday that the luggage of the Saudi team which was sent to Istanbul at the time of Khashoggi's killing contained syringes, large scissors, staple guns, walkie-talkies, electric shock devices and a signal jammer.\n\nIt published photos of X-rays of bags taken as the Saudis passed through security checks at the airport when they left. Reuters could not immediately verify the Sabah report.\n\nErdogan has not given details of the contents of the tapes but two sources with knowledge of the issue have told Reuters that Turkey has several audio recordings.\n\nThey include the killing itself and conversations before the operation which Turkey subsequently uncovered, the sources said. These had led Ankara to conclude from an early stage that the killing was premeditated, despite Saudi Arabia's initial denials of any knowledge or involvement.\n\nSaudi Arabia's prosecutor Saud al-Mojeb has since said Khashoggi's killing was planned in advance, although another Saudi official said Prince Mohammed had no knowledge of the specific operation.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

In the United States, American, United and Southwest use the Boeing model.\n\nDennis Tajer, a 737 captain and spokesman for Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents American Airlines Group Inc. pilots, said his union was informed after the crash about a new system Boeing had installed on 737 MAX jets that could command the plane's nose down in certain situations to prevent a stall.\n\n\"It is information that we were not privy to in training or in any other manuals or materials,\" he said.\n\nBoeing said it was taking \"every measure\" to fully understand all aspects of the incident and working closely with the investigating team and all regulatory authorities involved.\n\nSoerjanto Tjahjono, head of Indonesia's transportation safety committee of crash investigators (KNKT), said on Monday that Indonesian regulators would tighten training requirements as a result of the findings of the investigation so far.\n\nThe comments focus attention on the contents of aircraft manuals and a conversion course allowing pilots of the previous generation of Boeing jet, the 737NG, to upgrade to the MAX.\n\nThe Oct. 29 crash was the first accident involving the 737 MAX, an updated version of Boeing's workhorse narrowbody jet that entered service last year.\n\nInformation recovered from the jet's flight data recorder last week led the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to issue an emergency airworthiness directive urging airlines to update their flight manuals.\n\nThe directive warned pilots that a computer on the Boeing 737 MAX could lead to the plane being forced to descend sharply for up to 10 seconds even in manual flight, leading to potential difficulties in controlling the plane.\n\nPilots could stop this automated response by pressing two buttons if the system behaved unexpectedly, but questions have been raised about how well prepared they were for such an automatic reaction and how much time they had to respond.\n\nBoeing's first 737 MAX 9, pictured in Seattle before delivery to Lion Air. Elaine Thompson / AP file\n\nCapt. Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Union, told NBC News, \"There is a fix: Simply flipping a switch should have turned the automatic system off.\"\n\n\"Once we know the system exists, and once we know the system can trigger for the right reasons or if we are made aware there may be a problem with it triggering for the wrong reasons, we are fully prepared to deal with either of those situations,\" Weaks said. \"But we really need to know what\u2019s on our airplane.\"\n\nEven though investigators say this problem was not covered in the operating manual, pilots did have access to a checklist designed to turn off errant systems when the plane started nosing downwards at the wrong time, said Soejono, a Lion Air instructor who like many Indonesians goes by one name.\n\nExperts say investigators will be examining whether the crew examined this checklist and if so whether they had time to cut off the automated nose-down system while flying at a relatively low altitude of 5,000 feet. Pilots on a previous flight are reported to have overcome a similar sensor problem.\n\nTo answer that question fully, investigators may need access to cockpit voice recordings thought to be hidden in the seabed.\n\n\"A failure like this on a modern jet airplane is very rare, and so something has happened here and the investigators, Boeing, the FAA, are are all looking very carefully at it,\" said Capt.

If so, you\u2019ve probably been asked at the checkout counter something like this: \u201cWould you like to apply for our credit card and get a big discount on today\u2019s purchase?\u201d\n\nFor retailers, this is not only prime-time sales, it\u2019s the peak season for generating new customers. Getting you to carry their credit card in your wallet is a perfect way to start a relationship and build brand loyalty.\n\n\u201cRetailers push their store credit cards because they know that if they get somebody to sign up for one of those cards, they're more likely to come back, and that's what it's really all about for them,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at the website CompareCards, a credit card comparison website.\n\nSome of the offers are mighty enticing:\n\nKohl\u2019s Charge card: 35 percent off your first purchase in store or online, plus another 15 percent discount when your card arrives in the mail.\n\nREI Co-op Mastercard: A $100 gift card when you make a purchase within the first 60 days of getting the card.\n\nThe Home Depot Consumer Credit Card: A $100 discount on a purchase of $1,000 or more within the first 30 days.\n\nAmazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card: A $70 Amazon gift card immediately upon approval.\n\nKeep in mind: Interest rates on most store cards are significantly higher than other credit cards. A recent study by CompareCards looked at credit cards from 50 of the nation\u2019s largest retailers and found that:\n\nThe average annual percentage rate (APR) for a store credit card is nearly 25 percent (24.97 percent), more than eight percentage points higher than the average APR Americans pay on other credit card debt \u2014 currently 16.46 percent, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nStore cards that can only be used at that specific retailer or family of stores had an average APR of 26.93 percent. Co-branded cards (with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover logo) that can be used anywhere had a slightly lower average APR (23.20 percent).\n\nRetailers say there\u2019s a reason why the interest rates on their credit cards are higher \u2014 it has to do with increased risk.\n\n\u201cStores are more willing to give a card to someone with untested credit than a bank, often on an instant-credit basis,\u201d said Craig Shearman, vice president for public relations at the National Retail Federation. \u201cThat means they are taking a larger risk and need to charge more interest to account for that.\u201d\n\nWEIGHING THE PROS & THE CONS\n\nA store card is clearly good for the retailer, but what about you? It all depends. And it\u2019s not easy to weigh the pros and cons when you\u2019re in a rush.\n\nThat could explain why nearly half (47 percent) of the people surveyed by CompareCards who have opened a store card, eventually regretted getting it. Those most likely to have regrets:\n\nParents with children under 18\n\nGeneration X\n\nThose with household incomes of $100,000 or higher\n\n\u201cA lot of times when you get these cards, you're doing it in a pressure situation at checkout and you don't have a whole lot of time to decide or to look at details, and sometimes you end up making a decision that you regret,\u201d Schulz said.\n\nIf you\u2019re offered a sizable discount on a significant purchase you\u2019re about to make \u2014 and you know you can pay off the balance when the statement arrives \u2014 it may be worth applying for the card at the register. I did that once and saved a bundle on an expensive winter coat, but I knew I could pay the bill in full when it arrived.\n\nYou don't have to be an accountant to understand that it doesn't make any sense to pay 25 percent in interest to save 20 percent on a purchase.\n\nAnd there may be other perks, such as special cardholder offers, early access to sales and ongoing rewards.\n\n\u201cThe most lucrative is a higher percentage of cash back,\u201d said Jill Gonzalez, an analyst with WalletHub, a personal finance website. \u201cRight now, that tends to be 5 percent. Target has a good card like that and so does Amazon.\u201d\n\nBecause retailers tend to have a much easier approval process, a store card can be a good option for someone who can\u2019t get a credit card because of no credit or poor credit.\n\n\u201cBy applying for a store credit card, you might be able to start building your credit,\u201d said Bill Hardekopf, CEO of lowcards.com, a card comparison website. \u201cIf you start slowly building your credit and show the credit bureaus that you are a good risk, either once again or for the first time, store credit cards can offer you that advantage.\u201d\n\nDEFERRED INTEREST OFFERS\n\nMany store cards offer \u201cspecial financing\u201d for that initial purchase: No interest for a specified promotional period, typically between 6 to 24 months.\n\nThese \u201cdeferred interest\u201d offers can be a real money-saver, but there\u2019s a big catch you need to know about: Fail to pay off the balance in full by the end of the promotional period or make just one late payment and you\u2019ll get hit with accrued interest on the full purchase price at the store\u2019s sky-high interest rate.\n\n\u201cA single late payment, even if it's late by a day, can trigger that interest charge for the entire period of the deferred interest offer \u2014 even if you're just a couple months into that deferred interest period \u2014 which can really set you back,\u201d said John Ganotis, founder of Credit Card Insider.\n\nLet\u2019s say you buy a TV for $1,000 and you don\u2019t pay off the entire balance by the end of the 12-month interest-free period or miss a payment. Assuming the interest rate on that card is 24.97 percent (the average APR for store cards right now) you\u2019ll be charged nearly $250 in accrued interest.\n\nNote: You will never pay off the balance by the end of the promotional period, if you only make the minimum monthly payment.\n\nSTUDY THE FINE PRINT AT HOME\n\nSo what do you do when you\u2019re offered an instant discount if you apply for the store\u2019s credit card?\n\nThe smart move is to get a brochure, take it home and review the terms and conditions. The checkout line isn't the place to make financial decisions.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re going to get a significant discount on a sizable purchase or you regularly shop at that store \u2014 and you know you will absolutely pay the bill in full when the statement comes \u2014 saying yes might make sense.\n\nIf you plan to carry a balance, don\u2019t even think about applying for that card.\n\n\u201cYou don't have to be an accountant to understand that it doesn't make any sense to pay 25 percent in interest to save 20 percent on a purchase,\u201d CompareCards Schulz said. \u201cAs good as that offer might sound, if you can\u2019t pay, stay away.\u201d\n\nYou can compare store credit cards at CompareCards, CreditCardInsider, and WalletHub.\n\nMORE FROM BETTER\n\nWant more tips like these?

It's not clear how Amazon will split its estimated $5 billion in spending to build a campus comparable to its original Seattle home base.\n\nThe company also said that it expects construction and operation of the so-called HQ2 to create \"tens of thousands of additional jobs and tens of billions of dollars in additional investment in the surrounding community.\"\n\nSteve Case, the former chief executive officer of AOL applauded the choice on Instagram, saying \"Amazon's announcement is a win not just for VA, but for the entire greater DC region.\"\n\nBut immediate praise was not universal.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected House representative for the Bronx-Queens area, tweeted that she's been getting calls from area residents who are outraged.\n\n\"Amazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nShe added in that the promise of bringing jobs to the community needs to be closely examined. \"Has the company promised to hire in the existing community? - What's the quality of jobs + how many are promised? Are these jobs low-wage or high wage? Are there benefits? Can people collectively bargain?\" she wrote in another tweet.\n\nAfter announcing that it was looking a new location for its second headquarters in September 2017, Amazon received applications from 238 cities. It narrowed the list to 20 finalists in January.\n\nThe two cities faced tough competition but managed to beat out contenders like Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles to win the highly coveted bid.", "Death toll in California Camp Fire rises to 42 copied!\n\nAuthorities announced the remains of 13 bodies were found in Northern California, which brings the fire\u2019s death toll to 42.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

William Love, who is based in Albany, New York, highlights lingering opposition three weeks before a resolution goes into effect setting rules for same-sex marriages in Episcopal churches nationwide. Love's letter sent Saturday said the policy going into effect Dec. 2 \"turns upside down over 2000 years of Church teaching\" about marriage.\n\n\"The Episcopal Church and Western Society have been hijacked by the 'Gay Rights Agenda,' which is very well organized, very strategic, very well financed, and very powerful,\" Love wrote in the eight-page letter.\n\nRev William Love Episcopal Church\n\nHe added: \"Satan is having a heyday bringing division into the Church over these issues.\"\n\nChurch leaders in July overwhelmingly passed the same-sex marriage resolution, which gives bishops with theological objections to same-sex marriages the option to have other clergy perform services. Eight dioceses had previously refused to comply with an earlier 2015 resolution allowing same-sex marriage in the church.\n\nLove is the only U.S. bishop refusing to comply with the new resolution, according to The Rev. Susan Russell, an activist for an inclusive church based in the Los Angeles diocese.\n\nEpiscopal Church Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said in a prepared statement Monday he's \"assessing the implications\" of Love's letter and will soon decide on \"appropriate actions.\"\n\n\"We are committed to the principle of full and equal access to, and inclusion in, the sacraments for all of the baptized children of God, including our LGBTQ siblings,\" he said.\n\nCurry said those who have taken vows to obey church doctrine must act in ways that uphold decisions of church.\n\nThe Times Union reported some parishioners gathered outside St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Albany on Sunday to ceremonially burn Love's letter announcing the directive.\n\nOther congregants said the directive doesn't fit the teachings of the church.\n\n\"You come to a church looking for comfort and love and you're told that you're acting in concert with Satan?\" said Nadya Lawson, an Albany resident who said she felt welcome at St. Andrew's as a lesbian. \"Anybody who doesn't fit in with his vision of how things should be is unsafe because of his letter and his actions.\"", "Trump on Scalia's nine children: 'I always knew I liked him'", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Ani Bundel\n\nYou never know what will hit big in the television landscape. If someone told HBO in 2008 that ten years down the line, a show about dragons would be the biggest series they ever created, chances are they wouldn\u2019t have believed you. Did anyone at Fox know that in 1986, a little cartoon about about a dingbat nuclear safety inspector and his family would not only put them on the map, but still be running in the next century? This year, the surprise breakout hit no one saw coming is on NBC. It\u2019s called \u201cManifest,\u201d a show that is basically a conglomerate of several other popular shows past and present, with dialogue so wooden it\u2019s a wonder the actors don\u2019t get splinters in their mouths while talking.\n\nAnd yet, as of this writing, it is one of the top five most watched broadcast shows for fall 2018, the fourth most popular scripted broadcast show on TV currently and the most popular new scripted series this season, according to Nielsen\u2019s household ratings metric. It\u2019s also better than it has any right to be on paper, which may account for why so many are tuning in.\n\nThis year, the surprise breakout hit no one saw coming is on NBC. It\u2019s called \u201cManifest,\u201d a show that is basically a conglomerate of several other popular shows past and present.\n\nMuch like \u201cLost,\u201d which ran on neighboring ABC from 2004-2010, the show\u2019s plot has to do with a plane (Flight 828) that disappears and then reappears five years later. Except instead of spending five seasons on an abandoned island, the pilot episode shows the airplane taking off in April of 2013 and landing three hours later in November of 2018 in the first ten minutes. The passengers, who were all assumed to be dead, cannot account for their missing years.\n\nThe result is a premise that seems to have been pitched as \u201cwhat if \u2018Lost,\u2019 but \u2018Found?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s not a bad idea. \u201cLost\u201d wasn\u2019t concerned with what would happen to its characters if they ever did get return to civilization. But by starting the series with the characters arriving back home, the mystery of what happened to the plane in \"Manifest\" is bolstered by the complicated mini-dramas of families and friends dealing with reunions after years apart and the general aftermath of lives that disappeared in the space of a single airplane ride.\n\nSo far, the show has mostly focused on one extended family, the Stones. Ben Stone (Josh Dallas) and his son Cal (Jack Messina) were bumped back to Flight 828 but his wife Grace (Athena Karkanis) and daughter Olive (Luna Blaise) were on the original flight which left just hours before. Their struggle to figure out how and if they can be a family again creates a \u201cThis Is Us\u201d-style drama \u2014 tears included. Meanwhile, Ben\u2019s sister Michaela (Melissa Roxburgh), who was also bumped back to Flight 828, works for the NYPD. She returns to find her fianc\u00e9 Jared (J.R. Ramirez) has married her best friend after Michaela was declared dead. Michaela goes back to work, only to find her crime solving skills aided by mysterious abilities she gained while on Flight 828, leading to interludes that echo \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d\n\nAnother passenger, Dr. Saanvi Bahl (Parveen Kaur) was researching cancer cures but in the intervening five years said research was discovered to be a breakthrough cure. The Stones\u2019 son Cal has exactly the kind of cancer Saanvi has figured out to cure (natch!), giving the series leave to turn also into a better version of \u201cNew Amsterdam\u201d for scenes at a time.\n\nIn all, \u201cManifest\u201d is five shows in one: a \u201cLost\u201d mystery, a police procedural, a family drama, a medical hero show and a government conspiracy story, all tucked into a neat 44 minutes of runtime.\n\nOverlaid on top of all of this is the mystery of what happened to Flight 828, and why some of the passengers are having psychic episodes, an investigation spearheaded by NSA Director Vance (Daryl Edwards) and his Deputy Powell (Tim Moriarty). Whether this is all an inside government plot remains to be seen, a wrinkle that produces a real \u201cX-Files\u201d vibe and has spawned obsessive Reddit threads. (My own personal theory is that the plane must have traveled to an alternative reality 2018, because not a single person has mentioned Trump being president yet, which seems like an impossible writer oversight.)\n\nAll in all, \u201cManifest\u201d is five shows in one: a \u201cLost\u201d mystery, a police procedural, a family drama, a medical hero show and a government conspiracy story, all tucked into a neat 44 minutes of runtime on Monday nights.\n\nSpeaking of Trump and politics, the one truly sour note of the show is its refusal to deal with America\u2019s changed political and cultural landscape of the last five years. It is not an exaggeration to say society has changed drastically since April of 2013, when, for example, gay marriage was still illegal in many states and social media was still considered fun and good. But \u201cManifest\u201d isn\u2019t interested in delving into anything that relevant. It clearly believes itself to be an escapist show and has therefore banned politics from the proceedings.\n\nTo be fair, one could do that on \u201cLost\u201d and get away with it. Everyone was, after all, on an island. But to have 191 passengers, most of whom are New York City residents, appear unfazed by the sociopolitical landscape they are dropped back into is perhaps the most unbelievable plot point of all.\n\nInstead, \u201cManifest\u201d wants to be all shows to all people. In doing so, it has no time to dig deep into any of its many plot points. One could argue its success is proof this is what the people want. At least, until a few mysteries start getting solved. But if \u201cManifest\u201d can follow in the footsteps of \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and successfully reveal its answers without losing audience interest, NBC might have another hit to take the network through the end of the decade.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Kyrsten Sinema is the apparent winner in the Arizona Senate race, narrowly defeating Republican Rep. Martha McSally, according to NBC News.\n\nAs of Monday night, Sinema had 1,097,321 votes, or 49.68 percent, while McSally had 1,059,124 votes, or 47.96 percent.\n\nSinema, who in 2013 became first openly bisexual person to be seated in the House of Representatives, is now also the first openly bisexual U.S. Senator. She is the first Democratic senator elected in Arizona in 30 years, since former Sen. Dennis DeConcini retired in 1995, and the first female Arizona Senator in the state's history.\n\nSinema gave a victory speech on Monday evening, honoring late Arizona Sen. John McCain and rejected divisive political rhetoric. Sinema referenced McCain's final address to Congress before his death and his call for civility in bipartisanship.\n\n\"It won\u2019t be easy, and it won\u2019t happen overnight, but we can work together to meet the challenges our country faces,\u201d Sinema said in her speech. \"We can do this differently. For our country, for our future, for Senator McCain, and for each other I think we must.\"\n\nMcSally conceded the race in a video statement on her Twitter account Monday evening.\n\n\"I just called Kyrsten Sinema and congratulated her on being Arizona's first female senator after a hard fight battle,\" McSally said. \"I wish her all success as she represents Arizona in the senate.\"\n\nThe race had been too close to call on election night and since then has been mired in a nail-biting process of counting outstanding mail-in ballots. A large portion of the voting population in Arizona votes by mail, and each of those ballots had to go through a signature verification process, which typically lasts several days after Election Day.\n\nThis process, however, came under intense scrutiny in recent days after President Donald Trump and other Republicans stoked unfounded claims that Sinema's growing lead was because of voter fraud.\n\nOver the weekend, Sinema's lead expanded by more than 32,000 votes as mail-in ballots were counted, driving her campaign to declare that her advantage was \"insurmountable.\" It also came after Arizona Republicans won a lawsuit to force equity in how mail-in ballot signatures were being verified in each county.\n\nSinema will replace GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, who did not seek a second term.\n\nAs a congresswoman, Sinema represented a district based in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe. She is a former Green Party activist who transformed herself into a centrist Democrat with one of the most conservative voting records among Democrats in Congress.\n\nNewly-elected U.S. Sen.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Claire Atkinson\n\nA cable industry trade group wants the U.S. Justice Department to look into alleged antitrust practices at Comcast \u2014 and the call has gotten the attention of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe American Cable Association, or ACA, which represents small to mid-sized cable systems across the U.S., sent a letter to the Justice Department on Monday asking it to scrutinize Comcast's business practices. Comcast said the allegations were without merit.\n\nComcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.\n\nThe letter suggests that Comcast has concentrated power given its ownership of a broadcast network, local TV stations, cable channels and regional sports networks in addition to being the largest U.S. cable TV provider.\n\nTrump tweeted about the letter after Charlie Gasparino, senior correspondent at Fox Business Network, covered it.\n\nTrump's constant attacks on journalists and media organizations have led to speculation that the president had targeted companies for their news operations. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is expected to to become the new House Intelligence Committee chair in January, told Axios that he plans to investigate whether the president had tried to use \"instruments of state power\" to put pressure on companies that own media outlets \u2014 many of which the president has routinely criticized in public.\n\nThe cable association members want to share instances of alleged antitrust practices involving Comcast, which, through NBCUniversal, sells bundles of channels to cable operators to distribute to consumers. But the group said they want the confidentiality attached to a formal process.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond for comment.\n\nThe ACA would not cite instances of antitrust practices to NBC News, but the letter to the Justice Department raises the risk that Comcast could restrict competitors from offering streaming service Hulu to its customers.\n\n\"Comcast-NBCU may restrict, if it is not already restricting, their ability to access Hulu and make it available to their customers as an alternative to their cable offerings,\" the ACA said in its letter.\n\nThe ACA declined to elaborate on this potential issue.\n\nThe letter comes shortly after restrictions placed on Comcast related to its 2011 acquisition of NBCUniversal expired, most notably conditions from the Justice Department that prevented NBCUniversal from withholding programming from competitors and also forced NBCUniversal to be a silent partner at Hulu, the streaming video company.\n\nAllen Grunes, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer, said that the Justice Department has the power to investigate even if it ultimately decides to take no action.\n\n\"The DOJ is always able to look at anticompetitive conduct if it is taking place,\" Grunes said. \"In that respect, it really doesn't matter whether there was or wasn't a prior merger or consent decree.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has already said it would be keeping a close watch on Comcast's business practices even after the consent decree ended.\n\nComcast said in a statement that the ACA letter was meant to give cable operators more power in negotiations and that the TV industry had become more competitive thanks to more options for consumers.\n\n\"We believe that ACA\u2019s letter is without merit and constitutes an inappropriate attempt to gain leverage in the commercial marketplace,\" Comcast said in a statement.\n\nThe company pointed out that Comcast Cable has brought Netflix and YouTube to its X1 TV platform while NBCUniversal has sold shows to Hulu, Netflix and other online services."]
