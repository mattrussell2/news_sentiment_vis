And he never got in trouble,\u201d Vicki told Dateline. \u201cHe was just your average, good kid.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating high school in his hometown of Ponte Vedra, Florida, Josh enrolled in Flagler College just 45 minutes down the Florida coast in St. Augustine. During his third year, though, Josh dropped out of school and moved home with his parents.\n\nVicki told Dateline it was partly because he was having a tough time. \u201cHe just had a mental breakdown one night,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was saying words that didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nBut he also moved back because he was considering becoming a police officer.\n\nVicki told Dateline she remembers Josh\u2019s 23rd birthday well. It was November 4, 2000. She and her husband Ed, Josh\u2019s father, spent the day together. Vicki says Ed and Josh went for a jog on the beach before Josh went to work his usual shift at Lulu\u2019s Restaurant around 5:30 p.m.\n\nVicki told Dateline that she expected Josh to finish his shift that night and return home around 11:00 p.m. But 11:00 p.m. came and went. Josh never came home.\n\n\u201cAround 11:30 p.m. we started to think, \u2018Well, that\u2019s odd,\u2019 because he\u2019s dependable,\u201d Vicki told Dateline, adding that Josh would always call to let them know if he was going to be late.\n\nKeeping Josh\u2019s recent mental health struggles in mind, Vicki says she and Ed started to panic and immediately began searching for their son. They drove around Ponte Vedra until around 5:00 a.m., when Vicki returned home and reported Josh missing to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office.\n\nWhile Vicki returned home and called authorities, Ed kept searching by car. He eventually found Josh\u2019s car parked by The Lodge & Club, a beach club in town. According to St. Johns County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesperson Chuck Mulligan, the car was locked and Josh\u2019s wallet was inside. Ed then found Josh\u2019s shoes on the beach, just a short distance from the car.\n\n\u201cIt was as if he had kicked [his shoes] off and walked off,\u201d Vicki said.\n\nOfficer Mulligan told Dateline that police employed vehicles, search dogs, and helicopters on the beach that morning looking for Josh. Authorities found no evidence leading them to his whereabouts. Officer Mulligan says that subsequent interviews with Josh\u2019s coworkers did bring some information to light.\n\n\u201cThere was some sort of disturbance between Josh and the person managing the restaurant,\u201d Officer Mulligan told Dateline. Co-workers told authorities that, following the disagreement, Josh left the restaurant around 7:30 p.m. Officer Mulligan says police do not have a clear idea of what happened that night.\n\nIn the months that followed their son\u2019s disappearance, Vicki and Ed contacted homeless shelters and handed out flyers, hoping to drum up leads on Josh\u2019s whereabouts.\n\n\u201cWe searched as best we could,\u201d Vicki told Dateline. Vicki and Ed left Josh\u2019s car at the beach for a few months in case he decided to come back for it. He never did.\n\nOver the years, authorities at the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office have followed up on many leads, investigating tips from as far as California. However, after 18 years and with no new leads on which to follow up, Officer Mulligan says the case is currently inactive.\n\nVicki says a small piece of her holds on to the hope that Josh will return. She told Dateline if he is alive, she would want to tell him: \u201cIt's been long enough Joshua. We are destroyed without you, and every one of us needs you in our lives. If you're there, just let us know that you are OK.\u201d\n\nToday, the 18th anniversary of his disappearance, is Josh\u2019s 41st birthday. As she does every year on his birthday, Vicki will go to the spot on the beach where her son\u2019s shoes were found. She will leave him a letter, flowers, and balloons.\n\nJosh is described as being 5\u2019 10\u201d and weighing 150 lbs., with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing baggy brown swim shorts and a black t-shirt. If you have any information surrounding his disappearance, please call the St. Johns County Sheriff\u2019s Office at (904) 824-8304 and ask for the Major Crimes Unit.", "Remembering the lives lost in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting copied!\n\nCantor Azi Schwartz of the Park Avenue Synagogue recites the Jewish Kaddish as a tribute to the 11 victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting.\n\nRead More", "Organization behind Hollywood film rating system opens up about process copied!\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America, the group responsible for rating films for audiences, turns 50 this year.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Lauren Egan\n\nHUNTINGTON, W.Va. \u2014 Heading into the final weekend before Election Day, President Donald Trump stuck to a dark, familiar script at two campaign rallies Friday, equating a vote for Democrats with chaos and crime.\n\n\"A blue wave would equal a crime wave, very simple,\" Trump told the crowd at his second rally of the day, in Indianapolis. \"And a red wave equals jobs and security.\"\n\nEarlier, in West Virginia, he suggested again that that blue wave could prevail \u2014 adding that if they did, he would still be alright.\n\n\u201cIt could happen, could happen,\" Trump told the crowd of rally-goers in a Huntington airport hangar, with Air Force One in the background. \"We are doing very well, and we are doing really well in the Senate, but it could happen.\u201d\n\nBut if it did, said Trump, he'd be okay. \"And you know what you do? My whole life, you know what I say? 'Don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll just figure it out.' Does that make sense? I\u2019ll just figure it out,\" he said.\n\nAt both Friday rallies, Trump looked to appeal to women voters, a pivotal demographic in the midterms, by framing immigration as a \"women's issue.\"\n\n\"[Women] want safe communities, and they want criminals thrown in jail, or thrown the hell out of our country,\" Trump said in Indianapolis. \"...I love women! Love them more than men.\"\n\n\"The Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan, and you see we have all these caravans forming, you see them there. Gee, I wonder how that happens. I wonder how,\" he added, appearing to imply again, without offering evidence, that Democrats had provided support. \"I think they overplayed their hand on this one, folks.\"\n\nIn West Virginia, Trump also repeated another recent message: that there's only so much he can do to help the GOP hold on to both chambers of Congress. There are a lot of competitive House races around the country, he said, and \"I can't go everywhere,\" meaning that Democrats could \"squeak it by.\"\n\nBut both of his Friday stops were focused on the upper chamber. In Huntington, Trump campaigned for West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin.\n\n\u201cI have to say, I like Joe. The problem is, I am just not going to get his vote,\" Trump said before introducing Morrisey.\n\nAcknowledging one potential flaw with that argument \u2014 he did get Manchin's vote just last month to approve his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 Trump said that vote was not proof his loyalty.\n\n\u201cSo I said Joe, I need the vote, like, today,\u201d Trump said, suggesting that Manchin took too long to commit his support. But after Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, announced her support for the nomination, \"we had all the votes, so we didn't need Joe's vote. And he pressed that button. ... I said 'Joe, Joe that doesn't count. It doesn't count.'\"\n\nWest Virginia has been a bedrock for President Trump. Only one other state went for him over Hillary Clinton by a greater margin in 2016, and it was one of only two states where every single county voted for the president. And contrary to national trends, Trump\u2019s high approval rating in West Virginia has remained steady throughout his presidency.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s continued popularity, Manchin has managed to hold an edge over Trump-allied Morrisey in polls of the closely watched Senate race.\n\nMichelle Williams, 42, a caregiver from Wayne County and a registered Republican, said at the rally that she hadn\u2019t decided who she would support for Senate on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI am not sure. I just don\u2019t know. I will probably vote Republican because I support the president but I just haven\u2019t decided. I\u2019ll go with my gut on Election Day,\u201d she said.\n\nJennifer Douglas, 48, who works at the Huntington airport where Trump held his rally, said she voted for Trump in 2016, and has voted for Manchin in the past \u2014 but wouldn\u2019t do so this time.\n\n\u201cI am going to vote straight Republican. I am just going to try something different. I won\u2019t say that I would never support Manchin again, but not this time,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Indianapolis later Friday evening, Trump headlined a rally for Republican Mike Braun, an Indiana businessman and state representative who is challenging Democratic incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly. A recent NBC poll suggests Donnelly has an edge of just two points, well within the poll\u2019s margin of error.\n\nTrump went after Donnelly for opposing Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination after he supported Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\n\"He joined the Democratic mob to vote against Justice Brett Kavanaugh,\" Trump said. The same NBC poll shows that 40 percent of voters in Indiana say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supported Kavanaugh compared to 33 percent who say they prefer someone who did not support him.\n\nTrump also criticized Donnelly for planning to campaign with former President Barack Obama in northwest Indiana this Sunday. Obama won the state in 2008 but lost in 2012.\n\n\"It is no surprise that Joe Donnelly is holding a rally this week with Barack H. Obama,\u201d Trump said, using his finger to draw the \"H,\" which stands for \"Hussein,\" in the air as he spoke.\n\nTrump plans to campaign throughout the weekend, appearing with Republican candidates in Montana, Florida, Georgia and Tennessee.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He said they had been directed to park at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach and a shuttle would take them and at least 20 others to Dark Harbor.\n\nThe ride usually takes 10 minutes, but Piatelli said he quickly realized something was wrong when he looked at a map on his phone and saw the shuttle was going in the opposite direction.\n\nPassengers then started begging the driver to pull over, but he refused, telling them to \"shut up and sit down,\" Piatelli said.\n\n\"We all were really scared,\" he said. \"We didn't know where he was taking us.\"\n\nPassengers began to call the police for help.\n\nAt one point, the driver slowed down, and Piatelli and others attempted to climb out the windows, he said.\n\n\"Everyone was trying to get off the bus, and he was trying to move the bus,\" he said.\n\nThe driver pushed one passenger who confronted him about where they were going, Piatelli said.\n\n\"When he pushed that guy, things started to go downhill and it snowballed,\" he said.\n\nThe driver eventually stopped the bus in Carson, which is about 20 minutes from their destination. Piatelli said he escaped by climbing out the window because the driver would not open the door.\n\nVideo taken by Piatelli shows him and other passengers standing in front of the bus and demanding the driver let the other passengers out.\n\n\"That was kidnapping what he did. All we wanted to do was go to Dark Harbor,\" he said, adding that he plans on getting a lawyer and will be contacting Queen Mary and the company that owns the shuttle.\n\n\"This is not OK,\" he said. \"This is all really unsettling.\"\n\nLos Angeles police responded and arrested the driver, identified as 60-year-old James Lee, just after 8 p.m.\n\nThe Long Beach Police Department said in a statement Friday that Lee told them he became disoriented because of road closures in the area and got lost.\n\nThey said in a tweet Friday that the incident was not kidnapping and they were investigating it as battery between the driver and a passenger.\n\nLee was booked and later released pending the outcome of the investigation, police said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Three of the Supreme Court's conservatives, Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have blocked the trial from proceeding until the issue of questioning Ross was resolved.\n\nThe census, conducted every 10 years, is required by the Constitution. The results determine the size of each state's delegation in the House of Representatives. Census figures are also used in calculating a state's share of funds under many federal grant programs.\n\nThe government said that questions about citizenship were included in nearly every census through 1950. For the 2020 census, the Trump administration said, the Justice Department asked that the question be added to provide more accurate information about the voting-age population.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in July, said immigrant communities will resist cooperating with the census because of concern about how the federal government will use citizenship information.\n\n\"These concerns have been amplified by the anti-immigrant policies, actions, and rhetoric targeting immigrant communities of President Trump and this administration,\" the legal complaint said.\n\nPostponing the trial would have reduced the chances of resolving the legal battle before printing of the census forms was to begin next year.", "By Suzanne Gamboa\n\nGustavo Navas in Miami has already voted for this election and voted Republican because he supports President Donald Trump.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Suzy Khimm\n\nThe Trump administration is rolling back a child labor rule for thousands of teenagers working in nursing homes and hospitals, eliciting a backlash from worker safety advocates.\n\nThe regulation targeted by the Labor Department, which was first implemented by the Obama administration, prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from independently operating power-driven patient lifts, which are commonly used in nursing homes and hospitals to move patients with mobility challenges.\n\nThe administration took its first formal step toward undoing the regulation in late September, releasing a proposed rollback that cites an employer survey and letters from industry groups as evidence that the regulation is hurting job opportunities for young people in a field already facing major labor shortages.\n\nBut worker safety advocates and several Congressional Democrats contend that the Labor Department is relying on flimsy evidence, which they say undermines the legal basis for the department\u2019s deregulatory push.\n\nThey say that the some of the administration\u2019s justifications for the plan \u2014 revealed through a public records request and obtained by NBC News \u2014 do not support the administration\u2019s own arguments. And they warn that the rollback will endanger young workers in an industry that already has a high injury rate, pointing to government research concluding that many 16- and 17-year olds \u201ccannot safely operate power-driven hoists to lift and transfer patients by themselves.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Department denied that its proposal would undermine worker safety, saying the change could add more than 23,000 young workers to the health care industry \u201cand enhance their future career skills and their earning potential.\u201d\n\nBig device, fear of risks\n\nThe large lift devices include a boom that extends over the patient, who is placed inside a sling to be transported from a bed to a bathroom, for example. Accidents involving power lifts have resulted in serious injuries and deaths of patients, according to Food and Drug Administration records.\n\nPenelope Shaw, 75, who lives in a nursing home in Massachusetts, lobbied the Trump administration to keep the existing protections, describing the risks of being transferred between her bed, a chair and the shower.\n\n\u201cI personally have had probably 300 incidents where the battery has failed, while I'm up in the air.... I doubt that 16- and 17-year olds have encountered lift emergencies, and could resolve them,\u201d Shaw told the Office of Management and Budget by phone in August, according to her prepared remarks. \u201cI'm also fearful teenagers would not respond to my direction in critical situations, putting me at risk of harm.\u201d\n\nAbout 56,000 teenagers ages 16 to 19 work as nursing, psychiatric or home health aides in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\u201cIt makes it a lot more stressful when you have to work with machinery, and it involves putting somebody else in danger,\u201d said Ariel LaRacuente, 17, who works as a youth labor advocate in Massachusetts and supports the existing protections for teenager workers. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect somebody who\u2019s so young to be able to take care of somebody and keep [them] from being hurt while using a power-driven lift.\u201d\n\nA question of evidence\n\nThe 2010 regulation originally prohibited all 16- and 17-year-olds from operating power lifts, but the following year, the Obama administration modified its guidance to allow the teens to operate the lifts if they work with a caregiver who is at least 18 years old, following recommendations from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nIn the recent proposed change, the Labor Department said that a 2012 survey of Massachusetts vocational schools had found that \u201cnearly 60 percent of respondents\u201d said employers had told them that the safety rule was increasing burdens on their staff. Nearly a quarter of the vocational schools responding to the survey said that \u201cstudents had to change jobs as a result\u201d of the regulation, the administration added.\n\nBut the survey about the regulation had just 22 respondents, nearly half of whom had not seen or were not aware of the Labor Department\u2019s 2011 memo describing the revised rule allowing teens to use the lifts under supervision, according to records obtained from the state of Massachusetts by the National Employment Law Project (NELP), a research and advocacy group.\n\nOnly five schools reported that students \u201chad to change job duties\u201d as a result of the regulation, according to a summary of the survey, which was conducted using SurveyMonkey, an online survey tool.\n\n\u201cThe results are basically anecdotal,\u201d said Debbie Berkowitz, director of NELP\u2019s worker health and safety program and a former Obama Labor official. \u201cThere is no technical data that it will increase jobs but there is plenty of evidence that it will hurt young workers.\u201d\n\nCritics in Congress\n\nSeveral House Democrats told Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta in a letter on Tuesday that they had serious concerns about the administration\u2019s reliance on the survey to justify its regulatory rollback.\n\n\u201cThe [Labor] Department\u2019s reliance on this nonscientific survey may violate the Department\u2019s data quality guidelines,\u201d Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., wrote in the letter, which was co-signed by three other House Democrats. The letter asked Acosta to post the survey \u201cand any other studies or data\u201d that the Department was relying on.\n\nUnder federal law, agencies are prohibited from \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d policy changes, which must be based on reasoned analysis or face a potential legal challenge based on the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\nThe Labor Department said it had followed all the proper procedures in proposing its regulatory rollback, saying that it would \u201csafely promote workforce development opportunities for youth, while still maintaining worker and patient safety,\u201d according to Labor Department spokeswoman Megan Sweeney, who cited bipartisan support for the administration\u2019s move.\n\nSweeney referred to complaints from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, as well as industry groups, that the Obama-era regulation would make nursing home and hospital staffing shortages worse and actually pose a greater threat to teen worker safety by forcing them to lift patients manually.\n\nTo support its proposal, the administration included letters signed by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., former Rep. Michael Michaud, D-Me., and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., raising concerns about the restrictions and citing health care worker shortages.\n\nBut the American Industrial Hygiene Association, which represents occupational safety professionals, said in a letter sent on Thursday to the Labor Department that the evidence presented was inadequate.\n\n\u201cIt would be irresponsible to place young workers at greater risk in an industry with one of the highest rates of injuries based upon a handful of letters and tangential anecdotes,\u201d the group wrote, raising concerns that the Labor Department provided \u201cno scientific evidence\u201d for its proposed rollback.\n\nThe administration is accepting public comments on its proposal through Nov. 26. The Labor Department must respond to the comments before proceeding with the policy change.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He was indicted by a county grand jury this week on two counts of murder, one count of criminal attempted murder and two counts of wanton endangerment.\n\nBush allegedly opened fire in a Kroger supermarket in Jeffersontown, just east of Louisville, on Oct. 24, fatally shooting Maurice Stallard, 69, from behind and then fatally shooting Vickie Lee Jones, 67, in the parking lot. Several police officers surrounded Bush in the courtroom Friday, and he did not speak.\n\nBush\u2019s public defender, Angela Elleman, expressed condolences to the victims' families but said Bush is entitled to due process.\n\n\"It's particularly in times of loss and tragedy that our constitution and our laws are particularly tested,\" attorney Angela Elleman said. \"Mr. Bush of course has the right to due process and a fair trial that we all are honored to have.\"\n\nThe families of Stallard and Jones declined to speak to reporters after the brief hearing, according to the Associated Press.

Wine, commonwealth attorney for the 30th judicial district, told reporters on Wednesday that it was too early to tell whether his office will seek the death penalty in the case.\n\nWine said at the time that, in Kentucky, the hate crimes statute is not a separate charge and only comes up at sentencing, when a judge can determine a hate crime was committed based on preponderance of evidence \u2014 but lawmakers have said that it does not apply in murder cases.\n\nA federal prosecutor said on Wednesday that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Kentucky, the Justice Department's civil rights division, and the FBI have an open and active federal hate crimes investigation into the killings.\n\nWine said Wednesday that he believes the killings were a hate crime, and that \"I believe there is no explanation for what happened \u2014 he did not know either of these individuals\" who were killed.\n\nThe person who exchanged gunfire with Bush, Dominiic Rozier, said he and Bush shot at each other from around a car\u2019s length away.\n\nRozier told WAVE that \"I was doing it to protect me and my wife,\" and that even though no one was hit by their gunfire he was sorry that anyone else may have been put in harm's way.\n\nHis wife, Kiera Dozier, told the station that she saw Jones on the phone saying that people were shooting and she needed to get home before Bush shot her in the parking lot.\n\n\"I heard her say she's trying to get home. She said 'these people are shooting, they\u2019re crazy, I just want to get home; Lord let me get home,'\" Kiera Dozier said. \"He [Bush] looked at her, and he kind of grinned and he just shot her.\"\n\nKiera Dozier said right after that Dominiic Dozier had drawn his gun and \"my husband said, 'don't do this. ... and before he could even say it the guy had the gun pointed at me, and there was another lady who was not too far from me.\u201d\n\nA funeral was held for Stallard on Tuesday, and Jones will be laid to rest on Saturday, WAVE reported.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Under that reading, financial benefits from an office holder's private business dealings would be exempt.\n\nIn his order Friday, Messitte said the government cannot appeal the case piecemeal and must wait for a final ruling after a trial. He also declined to put a hold on the case, which would have blocked the challengers from seeking evidence about his hotel business through the legal process known as discovery.\n\nHe ordered lawyers for Maryland and Washington, D.C., to submit a schedule for discovery within 20 days. That order can be appealed.\n\n\"This is another major win for us in this historic case,\" said Karl Racine, Washington's attorney general. \"We will soon provide the court a new schedule to begin the process of getting information about how President Trump is profiting from the presidency.\"\n\nThe Justice Department, which is representing Trump, had no comment on Friday's ruling.\n\nBrian Frosh, the attorney general of Maryland, told NBC News that he hopes to begin the discovery process soon, but expects it to be three to four months until they get documents. He added that his office might need to depose Trump employees and potentially Trump himself.\n\nHe added that his wishlist of documents includes \"financial records of the hotel, who stays there, what they paid.\"\n\n\"We know foreign governments stay there as well as state governments,\" he said. \"It's not a very high bar to prove the president has taken emoluments in violation of the constitution.\"\n\n\"No other president has stepped anywhere near the line and Trump has blown across it,\" he said. \"He should only get his salary and nothing else.\"", "/ Source: Reuters By Reuters\n\nPHNOM PENH - From a dress inspired by the plume of a peacock and fashioned out of bottle caps and cement sacks, to a black and orange tiger outfit made of plastic bags, one group of LGBTQ fashion designers in Cambodia crafts beauty from trash to battle discrimination.\n\nViolent attacks on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community are common in the conservative Southeast Asian nation, even though attitudes toward same-sex relationships have improved in recent years.\n\n\u201cJust five or 10 years ago, Cambodians saw the LGBT community as social trash,\u201d said Ith Sovannareach, founder of La Chhouk Recycled & Creative Fashion. \u201cPeople saw them as unnatural strangers.\"\n\n\u201cBut now there is less discrimination, as we\u2019ve seen more coverage on television and in newspapers about their capabilities,\" Sovannareach added\n\nModels wear clothes made out of recycled materials during a show organized by LGBTQ fashion designers on Oct. 24, 2018, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to battle discrimination.

Timm\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in his midterm pitch to voters, has repeatedly sought to brand the Democratic Party as the \"party of crime,\" painting for his supporters a dim, dystopian portrait of his political opponents.\n\n\"I have said it, and I will say it as many times as you want to hear it, and it is because of their policy. The Democrats are truly the party of crime,\" Trump said earlier this month at a campaign rally.\n\nLet's take a look at the claims Trump uses to back up this argument in two different speeches \u2014 an October 1 rally in Tennessee and a Virginia rally on October 13 \u2014 and the facts behind them.\n\nClaim: \"The Democrats to want to open our borders to a flood of deadly drugs and ruthless gangs,\" Trump said in Virginia.\n\nDemocrats do not support open borders.\n\nThe party opposed the border wall Trump campaigned on\u2014 arguing that it is an expensive and ineffective way to secure borders \u2014 but many Democrats voted to fund border fencing and other security initiatives in the past. The party\u2019s 2016 official platform vows to \u201ctackle the rise of drugs, transnational crime, and corruption.\u201d\n\nClaim: Democrats \"want to abolish ICE, immigration enforcement entirely,\" Trump said in Tennessee.\n\nSome Democrats have advocated for eliminating the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and rethinking immigration enforcement, but none have advocated for completely ending all immigration enforcement.\n\nICE has only existed for 15 years; immigration enforcement existed long before the agency.\n\nClaim: Democrats \"want to turn America into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and MS-13 thugs. And don\u2019t kid yourself, that's what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump said in the Virginia rally.\n\nTrump is kidding himself: Democrats have not expressed or even hinted at a desire to encourage and support crime or gang members.\n\nClaim: \"They support sanctuary cities that allow violent crime, MS-13,\" Trump said in Tennessee.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that sanctuary cities encourage rampant crime and gang activity is unsubstantiated.\n\nThere's no evidence sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, foster crime or gangs, or are more crime-ridden than other cities without sanctuary policies.\n\nAn immigration violation is considered a civil offense. Advocates and police say keeping civil immigration enforcement and criminal police enforcement separate helps police fight crime, because immigrants aren\u2019t afraid to talk to police and report crime.\n\nClaim: \"The only immigration policy Democrats support is catch and release. How about that one, you catch a criminal thug, you take the name, and then you release them and say please show up in five years to court. Number one it\u2019s ridiculous, number two they never show up. What a mess,\" Trump said in Virginia.\n\nThis is false on several levels. There is no current or proposed policy known as \"catch and release,\" though Trump frequently uses the term to decry protections afforded to children and families seeking asylum in the U.S., which includes releasing some undocumented immigrants pending immigration court proceedings.\n\nU.S. courts do not allow children to be detained for long periods of time, which is why they are typically released \u2014 though the Trump administration separated thousands of children from their parents this spring in an effort to prosecute those adults instead of releasing them. Democrats have supported a bill that would bar such family separations. Trump has falsely described that bill as an \"open borders bill.\"\n\nSome immigrants released into the U.S. pending immigration court appearances do skip court appearances, but not all. Women and children have extremely high compliance rates with court appearances if they are able to obtain legal counsel, advocates add.\n\nClaim: Democrats \"want to give health care to illegal aliens,\" Trump said in Tennessee.\n\nIt's true that California Democrats have pushed for a bill that extends universal health care to include undocumented immigrants in the state. Some argue that the state already pays for immigrant health care through emergency room services, which cannot deny care based on immigration status.\n\nNational Democrats have not advanced such legislation, but the nation's largest blue state is often a testing ground for progressive ideas.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Completed in 1925, it was built to commemorate 49 servicemen from the county who died in World War I.\n\nIn 2012, the American Humanist Association filed a lawsuit, claiming that its presence on public land violates the Constitution, amount to a government establishment of religion. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia agreed, saying it could not ignore that \"for thousands of years the Latin cross has represented Christianity.\"\n\nBecause the government owns the land on which the cross sits and has spent public money to maintain the memorial, the government improperly entangled itself with a particular religion, the appeals court said. A reasonable observer would conclude that the government \"either places Christianity above other faiths, views being American and Christian as one in the same, or both.\"\n\nDefending the cross, the American Legion argues that the memorial was designed to mirror the cross-shaped markers on the graves of American servicemen overseas. In the aftermath of World War I, the group says, crosses became the cultural symbol of the fallen, so the government \"may use a cross when commemorating a secular, historical event.\"\n\nA Supreme Court decision upholding the lower court ruling against the cross would cast doubt on hundreds of similar monuments nationwide that use crosses to commemorate lives lost in war, the American Legion warns.\n\nThe case will be argued early next year.", "By Saleah Blancaflor\n\nAfter previously serving as the editor-in-chief for Lucky Magazine and health and beauty director at Teen Vogue, Eva Chen can now add \"published children's book author\" to her bio.\n\n\"My whole life I wanted to write children\u2019s books for as long as I can remember,\" Chen, the current director of fashion partnerships at Instagram, said. \"Around my daughter\u2019s age \u2014 she\u2019s 4 \u2014 I would walk around with a notebook.

With each pair of shoes, she gets one step closer to understanding what it means to be in her own shoes.\n\nBefore revealing her tips on how to take the perfect Instagram selfie, Chen spoke with NBC Asian America about what her inspired \"Juno Valentine,\" the women who inspired the book, and what it means for her children to grow up in a world where they can be heard and seen.\n\nWhat was your main inspiration behind writing \u201cJuno Valentine and the Magical Shoes\u201d?\n\nJuno Valentine is a fairytale \u2014 a fashion fairytale \u2014 and it is a girl\u2019s guide to empowerment as well. I wrote it because I think in this juncture in time, history, and politics, with everything going on, girls cannot be told enough that 1) they matter; and 2) they have to have a voice and to be themselves. I wrote this book to encapsulate all those messages, which are heavy messages, and even at the age of 3, 4, or 5, it\u2019s good to start hearing that and having that in your life.\n\nThis book features a lot of iconic women from the present including Lady Gaga to Serena Williams and women from the past as well, such as Frida Kahlo and Cleopatra. How did you go about choosing which women to include in this book? Were they ones you felt made an impact in your life in some way?\n\nLady Gaga, I wish I could say she is my life coach! While I was approaching the book, which is basically about a little girl who loses her pair of shoes and goes on a caper and this adventure of time and space to find a new pair of shoes...she ends up trying the shoes of all these iconic women. When I was choosing the women, it was a mix of a lot of factors. Of course, someone like Frida Kahlo, when you read her story and how she was such a trailblazer and had her own voice so long ago, to Cleopatra, who is iconic and has a very strong fashion point-of-view, I really wanted it to be a mix of women. Yayoi Kusama, the artist, is in the book as well and is incredibly inspiring and a trailblazer in her own way. Really, I was just looking for that: female trailblazers that, as a 3-year-old, you won\u2019t be like, \"Oh, I know exactly who Gloria Steinem is!\" But it\u2019s subliminal messaging that hopefully seeps into the subconscious and helps them set the stage to appreciate these women.\n\nI wanted to make a book that was fun for parents to read too. If you\u2019re a fashion fan, you\u2019ll recognize the Vivienne Westwood heel that Naomi Campbell wore and tripped on famously over a decade ago. You\u2019ll see shoutouts to Gigi Hadid and the blogger Chiara Ferragni, you\u2019ll see famous pairs of shoes from Chanel, and accelerant to pop culture moments \u2014 like the Lady Gaga and Alexander McQueen hologram and the armadillo heel. So, that\u2019s for parents, and kids will like it too because it\u2019s fun and sparkly.\n\nAs you said, the book is fun and sparkly and the pictures are very colorful and vibrant. How did you go about collaborating with illustrator Derek Desierto to create the vision you wanted for the drawings in this book?\n\nIt\u2019s funny, because I work at Instagram and that\u2019s my day job and the whole book came together on Instagram. I had written this book, and at first I didn\u2019t have a book deal. My book agent started going to all these different publishing houses and I\u2019m a huge bookworm. I love to read and always have loved to read. Every time you go to a book publishing house, the first thing you see is a huge bookshelf. You know that scene in \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d \u2014 and of course I\u2019m referencing a vintage Disney movie \u2014 and Belle is on the ladder and she\u2019s swinging and totally enraptured? That\u2019s me anytime I\u2019m around a stack of books and I was just really excited. I was going to these book publishing houses and hugging the book shelves and a woman who I worked with named Allison \u2014 we were Instagram friends and I used to work with her when I was a magazine editor \u2014 she DMed me and she was like, \"What\u2019s going on? Are you just hanging out at book publishing houses? Are you selling a book? Tell me!\" And I was like, \"I\u2019m selling a book! But I think you guys might\u2019ve passed on the book.\" And she said, \"Hold, please.\" So if it wasn\u2019t for that fateful DM at the right moment, that\u2019s how my book deal came about.\n\nDerek, actually, he\u2019s amazingly talented and he tagged me in a photo illustration he did two years before I started writing the book, and I saved that Instagram post because I loved his style since it was so quirky and fun. I remember thinking, \"If I ever write a children\u2019s book...maybe I should talk to Derek.\" Two years later, when I finished the book, I DMed him out of the blue and asked him if he wanted to do a children\u2019s book together. We did the book over the course of seven or eight weeks and we did it all through DM, FaceTime, texting. We actually didn\u2019t meet in person until quite recently so it\u2019s kind of this Instagram fairytale and has helped me get closer to these people.\n\nHow important is it that your own daughter and son, and other children as well, have a book like this \u2014 one with an Asian-American child as the main character \u2014 growing up?\n\nIt\u2019s so important. I think representation and diversity begins at a very young age. You might not be conscious of it completely until you see more people that look like you. When my daughter first saw the book, she kept asking me, \"Is that me, Mommy? Is that me?\" Juno is meant to be mixed race so it was definitely inspired by my daughter all around. I think Asian American representation still has a long way to go, and I\u2019m not talking just about children\u2019s books and book publishing, but we\u2019re at this place right now with \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d and \u201cTo All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before.\" When the success of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d happened, I didn\u2019t know a lot of the cast members, but literally me clapping my hands and screaming and being excited about it matters. Having a voice, being open, and talking about it is the first step.\n\nFor me growing up, I remember the ideals of beauty and they all didn\u2019t look like us. It was more like blonde hair, blue eyes, \"all-American.\" It\u2019s almost 2019 and the realization that there\u2019s billions of people on the planet and everyone looks different, but finding your own beauty is the most important thing you can do \u2014 and it\u2019s one of the messages in the book: that being yourself is the most important thing, and knowing that it might take time for you to accept that. For me, it\u2019s taken me until my mid-30s and it\u2019s taken some time for me to own who I am, and because of books like \u201cJuno Valentine and the Magical Shoes\u201d and because of platforms like Instagram, people can reach those goals faster of becoming more comfortable in their own skin.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Shea revealed that neither sister had lived with their parents since Nov. 30, 2017, when they ran away.\n\nHe said there were abuse allegations involving other family members, which were not corroborated. But the pair were removed from the home, and placed in a \"shelter-type\" facility in Virginia similar to one for domestic violence victims, he said.\n\nThey remained there until Aug. 23 or 24, when they vanished.\n\nPolice have been able to largely retrace their steps through detective work, but still \"do have some gaps to fill,\" Shea said.\n\nThe older sister's credit card records show they headed to Washington, D.C., after leaving Fairfax, and then made their way to Philadelphia. They arrived in New York on Sept. 1 \u2014 11 days before they were reported missing.\n\nShea said the sisters stayed at a number of \"high-end hotels\" in Manhattan, and used the credit card to go shopping and order their meals together.\n\nDetectives are also investigating claims they applied for asylum to remain in the United States. Detectives were told the sisters had previously made statements \"they would rather inflict harm on themselves, commit suicide, than return to Saudi Arabia,\" Shea said.\n\nDeportation was \"a fear of theirs,\" he added.\n\nIn video police have been able to obtain of the pair from about a week before their deaths, they did not appear to be in distress, and looked \"to be in good health and alone.\"\n\nBut that might have changed in the days that followed \u2014 Shea said \"there was a strong possibility money was running out\" because the older sister had maxed out her credit card.\n\nPolice said a witness said he saw the pair in a playground near the river in Manhattan's Riverside Park on the morning their bodies were found. They were sitting about 30 feet away from each other with their hands in their heads. They appeared to be praying.\n\nShea said the witness, who appeared to be credible, described the scene as \"haunting.\"'\n\nShea noted \"you could walk right into the water\" from near the area they were seen.\n\nNYPD investigators said on Thursday that the sisters appear to have been alive when they entered the river, because their lungs were filled with water and there were no obvious signs of trauma. The medical examiner's office is investigating the cause of death. A law enforcement official told NBC News that suicide remains \u201ca leading theory.\"\n\nThe pair had arrived in the United States with their mother and brothers \u2014 all citizens of Saudi Arabia \u2014 in 2015, according to police.\n\n\"The citizens were students accompanying their brother in Washington,\" the Saudi Consulate General said in a statement earlier this week.\n\nAdding to the mystery, the Associated Press reported that their mother told detectives that on the day before the bodies were discovered, she received a call from an official at the Saudi Arabian Embassy, ordering the family to leave the U.S. because the daughters had applied for political asylum.\n\nShea said Friday he could not confirm that report, and that he's not sure of the parents' present whereabouts.\n\nThe Saudi's Consulate General in New York said in their statement earlier in the week that it had \"appointed an attorney to follow the case closely.\"", "Trump: Fake news 'creating violence by not writing the truth' copied!\n\nPresident Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of the news media and said \"a lot of the reporters are creating violence by not writing the truth.\"\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Trump responded, \"That's because black people are too stupid to vote for me.\"\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Cohen was once one of Trump's most loyal defenders. But Cohen has publicly distanced himself from the president after pleading guilty to eight felony counts of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations in August.\n\nThe charges were related to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Cohen pledged to cooperate. He is to be sentenced in December.\n\nCohen, who previously said he'd be willing to \"take a bullet\" for Trump, told the magazine he knew that the president's private remarks were more disparaging than his public comments and he wanted to give voters a glimpse into Trump\u2019s character before the midterm elections.\n\n\"I should have been a bigger person, and I should have left,\" Cohen told Vanity Fair, adding that he thought the presidency would change Trump. \"I truly thought the office would change him.\"\n\nCohen recalled to the magazine another conversation he had with Trump in the late 2000s while traveling to Chicago for a meeting in which he disparaged African Americans again.\n\n\"We were going from the airport to the hotel, and we drove through what looked like a rougher neighborhood. Trump made a comment to me, saying that only the blacks could live like this,\" Cohen said.\n\nCohen also recounted when Trump talked after Nelson Mandela's death and criticized areas run by blacks.\n\n\"(Trump) said to me, 'Name one country run by a black person that's not a shithole,' and then he added, 'Name one city,'\" Cohen said.\n\nTrump also disparaged a black contestant on his reality TV show The Apprentice. Cohen said he and Trump were discussing the show's first season, which had Bill Rancic, who is white, going against Kwame Jackson, who is black, in the finale.\n\n\"Trump was explaining his back-and-forth about not picking Jackson,\" Cohen said. \"He said, 'There's no way I can let this black f-g win.'\"\n\nVanity Fair said Jackson confirmed that he had heard that the president made such a remark.\n\nA source inside the Trump Organization slammed Cohen's allegations saying they were false and characterized them as \"more lies from a serial liar.\"\n\n\"This is a guy who told the Daily Beast it\u2019s not illegal to rape your wife and tweeted threatening comments about members of the media, but now has suddenly found God,\" the source said, referring to a threat Cohen made to a reporter who was writing a story on sexual assault allegations against Trump.\n\n\"The only person to blame for Michael's situation is Michael.\"\n\nTrump has also distanced himself from Cohen. He previously derided Cohen, who worked for Trump for a decade, as \"a PR person who did small legal work,\" and said it was \"very sad\" that Cohen had struck a deal to \"achieve a lighter sentence.\"\n\nTrump previously faced similar accusations when former Apprentice contestant and White House adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman claimed in August, without evidence, she had heard a tape of Trump using the N-word.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved a powerful new opioid Friday, despite strong criticism and accusations that it bypassed its own advisory process to do it.\n\nThe new drug, Dsuvia, is a tablet that goes under the tongue. It is designed for use in the battlefield and in other emergency situations to treat intense, acute pain.\n\nKnown generically as sufentanil, it\u2019s a new formulation of a drug currently given intravenously. Critics say it will be incredibly easy for health workers to pocket and divert the drug to the illicit drug market and because it is so small and concentrated, it will likely kill people who overdose on it.\n\n\u201cThis is a dangerous, reckless move,\u201d said Dr. Sidney Wolfe senior adviser of Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group. He questions whether there\u2019s need for yet another synthetic opioid when the U.S. is in the throes of an opioid overdose crisis.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb defended the decision in a lengthy statement.\n\n\u201cWe understand the concerns about the availability of a high potency formulation of sufentanil and the associated risks,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThere are very tight restrictions being placed on the distribution and use of this product. We\u2019ve learned much from the harmful impact that other oral opioid products can have in the context of the opioid crisis,\u201d Gottlieb added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve applied those hard lessons as part of the steps we\u2019re taking to address safety concerns for Dsuvia.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. Raeford Brown, chair of the FDA\u2019s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee and a professor of anesthesiology and pediatrics at the University of Kentucky, said he did not think the FDA had taken enough care.\n\n\u201cI am very disappointed with the decision of the agency to approve Dsuvia,\u201d Brown said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis action is inconsistent with the charter of the agency. As I discussed with representatives of the agency today, neither the lack of efficacy data, nor the sponsor\u2019s response to safety concerns, have been answered,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cClearly the issue of the safety of the public is not important to the commissioner, despite his attempts to obfuscate and misdirect.\u201d\n\nBrown, who has issued statements critical of FDA in tandem with Public Citizen, said he was left out of the advisory process for Dsuvia. He was not present when his committee voted to recommend approval on October 12.\n\n\u201cIt is certain that Dsuvia will worsen the opioid epidemic and kill people needlessly,\u201d Wolfe said. \u201cIt will be taken by medical personnel and others for whom it has not been prescribed. And many of those will overdose and die.\u201d\n\nOpioids, including prescription opioids and heroin, killed 42,000 people in 2016, the CDC says. Provisional numbers for 2017 indicate they killed 49,000. Opioid overdose deaths are so bad that they have helped lower U.S. life expectancy.\n\nSynthetic opioids alone killed 27,000 people in 2017, the CDC says.\n\nGottlieb said the FDA considered the risks carefully. He noted that opioids require special care, both because of the overdose epidemic and because Congress has told the FDA to take special considerations into account when approving opioid products.\n\nThey include a plan to control their use, called a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. \"It can\u2019t be dispensed to patients for home use and should not be used for more than 72 hours. And it should only be administered by a health care provider using a single-dose applicator. That means it won\u2019t be available at retail pharmacies for patients to take home,\" Gottlieb said.\n\n\u201cI believe that the unique aspects of Dsuvia, including those that make this drug a high priority for the Pentagon, differentiate this new formulation of sufentanil from other sufentanil products in a way that is consistent with population-based considerations for how it fits into the overall drug armamentarium,\u201d Gottlieb added.\n\nThe military had asked for the drug to be made available, he said.\n\n\u201cThe FDA has made it a high priority to make sure our soldiers have access to treatments that meet the unique needs of the battlefield, including when intravenous administration is not possible for the treatment of acute pain related to battlefield wounds,\u201d he added.\n\nWolfe disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible decision,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FDA has been accused of doing too little to control opioid prescriptions before. A team of Johns Hopkins University researchers, including a former FDA official, published what they said was evidence the FDA did little to stop doctors who were over-prescribing opioids.", "Selfie 101 with Instagram's Eva Chen copied!\n\nEva Chen, director of fashion partnerships at Instagram, shares her tips and tricks on taking the perfect selfie.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Josh Lederman, Carol E. Lee and Dan De Luce\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's latest move on Iran is exposing tensions among his top national security advisers over how far to take his \"maximum pressure\" campaign.\n\nSince pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal in May, Trump has publicly projected an uncompromising approach toward ramping up pressure on Tehran, even tweeting Friday a photo of himself stylized as a movie poster with the title \"Sanctions Are Coming.\" So Iran hawks both within and outside of his administration were taken aback to learn that the administration's new sanctions fall notably short of a zero-tolerance policy, five individuals familiar with the deliberations said.\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump's national security adviser, and those in his hawkish camp have wanted as few exceptions as possible to reimposed U.S. sanctions targeting Iran's lucrative oil sector, a key point of leverage as the country struggles economically. The Trump administration has been saying for months that all countries need to completely eliminate all oil imports from Iran or face U.S. sanctions.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks during the United Against Nuclear Iran Summit on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 25, 2018. Darren Ornitz / Reuters file\n\n\"Maximum pressure means maximum pressure,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday.\n\nNevertheless, Pompeo said the administration will grant waivers to eight nations that have significantly reduced their imports, allowing them to keep importing some oil from Iran. Pompeo said two of the eight will soon get to zero imports but just need more time. Pompeo declined to name any of the countries getting waivers, but two people briefed on the waivers tell NBC News that major Asian buyers of Iranian oil \u2014 including U.S. allies India and South Korea \u2014 will get waivers.\n\nAnd despite insisting for months that Iran must be kicked off of SWIFT, the dominant global financial messaging service, the Trump administration stopped short of threatening sanctions unless Iran is totally forced off the system. Instead, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration was developing a list of some Iranian banks that must be removed. But he acknowledged some financial transactions with Iran through the system will be allowed to continue.\n\nEven in the hours before Pompeo and Mnuchin announced the moves Friday, White House officials were still not fully aware of the specifics of what will be allowed regarding oil waivers and SWIFT, several individuals briefed on the discussions said. Indeed, Pompeo told reporters that negotiations with some countries about the waivers were still ongoing ahead of Monday's deadline.\n\nA senior administration official pushed back on the notion that there was disagreement between the White House, the State Department and Treasury, saying that Trump and his National Security Council had been fully briefed.\n\nA National Security Council spokesman wouldn't discuss Bolton's views about the sanctions, telling NBC News: \"We don't comment on internal deliberations.\" Treasury declined to comment.\n\nAny public impression that Trump is walking back his aggressive posture toward Iran would be expected to irk the president.\n\nTrump has made his tough stance toward Iran a hallmark of his foreign policy. He and Bolton have generally brushed off the pleas from allies like France, Germany and the U.K. to allow Iran to continue conducting business with foreign countries that had been permitted under the nuclear deal struck by former President Barack Obama and world powers.\n\n\"I don't think this case is closed yet,\" said Richard Goldberg of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank that advocates hawkish policies toward Iran. \"When the president discovers how weak this made him look, he may order Treasury to 'take the hill,' so to speak.\"\n\nInitially, Bolton had been scheduled to issue a public statement on-camera on Friday announcing the new round of sanctions. But his appearance was later canceled. Instead, Mnuchin and Pompeo made the announcement. It was unclear whether the change in plans for the roll-out was related to Bolton's misgivings about the forthcoming policy.\n\nThe perception that the Trump administration is easing up on its \"maximum pressure\" campaign has also irked the president's traditional allies in Congress. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a vocal Iran critic, said Friday that the U.S. must \"stay strong against the Iranian regime.\"\n\n\"I share the concerns expressed by my colleagues regarding the potential 'softness' of Iran sanctions,\" Graham said in a statement.\n\nIn August, 16 Republican senators wrote to Mnuchin demanding Iran be totally cut off from the SWIFT system. And Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas recently introduced legislation that would require the Trump administration to impose sanctions on SWIFT members if the messaging system fails to suspend Iran.\n\nThe sanctions against Iran's crude oil exports mark the second phase of Trump's decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions that had been lifted under its terms. The first set of sanctions that were reimposed on Iran targeted the country's automotive industry, civil aviation sector and the trade of gold and other metals.\n\nThe administration gave countries several months to prepare for the more biting oil sanctions. During that time, the countries set to receive waivers made their case to senior Trump administration officials, arguing that too precipitous a reduction would destabilize global energy markets and drive up the price of oil.\n\nAlthough the U.S. can't force SWIFT, based in Belgium, to kick off Iranian banks, it could threaten to impose sanctions on members of SWIFT's board \u2014 including major U.S. bank chiefs \u2014 if it doesn't acquiesce. The Trump administration wants Iranian banks removed from the system to make it harder for Iran to transfer funds into the country and shore up its beleaguered currency.\n\nBut European countries and other supporters of the Iran deal say it would be even harder to track money-laundering and terror financing if Iran weren't on the system. The Europeans have even threatened to create their own alternative payment mechanism to continue business with Iran that would bypass the U.S. and the threat of American sanctions.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Seventy percent of those registrations belonged to African-Americans.\n\nThe \"exact match\" protocol requires information on voter registration applications to precisely match information on file with the state's Department of Motor Vehicles or the Social Security Administration. An individual can obtain a driver's license in Georgia even if they are not a citizen. However, if that person then becomes a naturalized citizen and registers to vote, the state's \"exact match\" process could erroneously flag them if their citizenship status is not updated.\n\nThough the October lawsuit seeks redress for all alleged violations, the groups asked for \"targeted relief\" in the form of a preliminary injunction for the \"approximately 3,141 individuals\" who were flagged by the state as noncitizens.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, only a deputy registrar can verify proof of citizenship at a polling place, which the groups argued amounted to an undue burden. The judge's ruling says Kemp must implement a process for election workers to verify proof of citizenship.\n\nRoss also said Kemp must also update the secretary of state\u2019s website with guidance for voters flagged as noncitizens, including contact information for voters to call with questions.\n\nIn addition, Kemp was ordered to issue a press release to \"accurately\" show how an individual who has been flagged over citizenship issues may vote in the upcoming election. He was also told to direct election officials to post a list of acceptable documentation to prove citizenship at polling places on Election Day.\n\nKemp's opponent, Democrat Stacey Abrams, and civil liberties groups have accused Kemp of voter suppression because of the racial disparity in the pending applications. But Kemp has rejected those accusations, saying the registrations were sloppily filled out and he is simply following Georgia state law.\n\nThe ruling Friday only deals with a portion of the 53,000 people whose voter registrations are pending.\n\nRoss, however, also detailed in her court order how voters who were flagged by the \"exact match\" process for a reason other than citizenship can still cast a ballot. Voters who were flagged and still pending can still vote if they show official forms of identification at the polls, such as a valid or expired Georgia driver's license, a valid Georgia voter identification card, a valid student photo ID card issued by a Georgia school or a passport.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

His lawyers pointed to probation sentences received by retired Gen. David Petraeus and former National Security Adviser Sandy Berger in their high-profile document retention cases.\n\nEven prosecutors were not insisting on jail time. They said they would be satisfied with a sentence within federal sentencing guidelines, which called for zero to six months in prison.\n\nU.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady expressed some frustration about the lack of answers on motive and imposed a 90-day sentence. He said he felt the guidelines were not sufficiently severe for this type of crime.\n\nRegis apologized for his actions but offered no reason for his crime. He worked as a government contractor assigned to the CIA between 2006 and 2016. He admitted copying classified information into dozens of personal notebooks and conducting unauthorized searches of classified databases.\n\nAccording to court documents, FBI agents found 60 notebooks containing classified information when they searched his home.\n\nRegis' defense lawyer, Cary Citronberg, said after Friday's hearing that his client \"had no nefarious purpose. It was just a mistake.\"\n\nCitronberg said he was disappointed in the sentence, especially given the comparison to Petraeus and Berger.\n\nDuring the hearing, prosecutor Danya Atiyeh took issue with the notion that high-profile defendants get special consideration.\n\n\"The government sees a lot of these cases and we go where the facts take us,\" Atiyeh said.\n\nShe declined to speculate on Regis' motive after O'Grady indicated it was \"the 64-dollar question\" that remained unanswered.\n\n\"I'm not sure I can fairly speculate as to what was going on in the defendant's head,\" she said.", "By Reynaldo Leanos, Jr.\n\nQUEENS, New York \u2014 It\u2019s early evening and Catalina Cruz, the Democratic nominee running for the 39th Assembly District, opens the door at an apartment complex.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see if they\u2019re home,\u201d she says to a member of her campaign, as she darts up a flight of stairs in her tennis shoes and arrives at another door and knocks.\n\nCruz, 35, and her team have knocked on more than 30,000 doors across the 39th district, which encompasses the neighborhoods of Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst in Queens, a borough of New York City and one of the country's most diverse areas.\n\nCatalina Cruz, democratic candidate running for assembly in New York.

The term Dreamer refers to young people who immigrated to the U.S. as children but do not have legal status. Cruz immigrated from Colombia with her family and grew up undocumented; she eventually gained citizenship after she married her high school sweetheart.\n\n\u201cHello, how are you?\u201d Cruz said in Spanish to a woman who answers the door with a young boy by her side. \u201cAnthony, how have you been? Do you remember me?\u201d\n\nCruz first met the family several weeks ago when she was out knocking on doors to better know members of the community. At the time, the family wasn\u2019t sure where Cruz stood on the issue of children with special needs, a topic important to them because their son, Anthony, has Down Syndrome.\n\n\u201cWhen I went upstairs I explained to this gentleman my own story and how I have a commitment to parents to make sure children with special needs get the resources they need from our state,\u201d Cruz told NBC News, recalling the first conversation she had with them. She shared with them that she has a younger brother with Down Syndrome in Colombia.\n\nThe decision to run wasn\u2019t easy. Cruz remembers sitting in the kitchen watching her mom wash dishes, when she asked her mother if she should consider running for office. One of the factors that spurred her into action was President Donald Trump's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, an Obama-era program that grants and allows undocumented young people who qualify the opportunity to work and study without fear of deportation.\n\n\u201cShe turns off the water, turns and looks at me and said to me, \u2018Do you think I went through all I went through for you to decide to be mediocre now?\u2019\u201d said Cruz. Her mother's response caught her off guard.\n\n\"'The conversation should not be about whether you should do this,'\" Cruz recalls her mother saying. \"'The conversation should be you informing me you\u2019re going to do this and asking me for help.\u201d\n\nEven though Cruz\u2019s mom was supportive, she also worried about what people would think about her daughter once they found out she had grown up undocumented.\n\nYet for Dreamer Monica Sibri, who works in Cruz's campaign, it was the candidate's life story that made her want to join her quest for office.\n\nCatalina Cruz helps pack candy for the Halloween parade in Jackson Heights, Queens. Reynaldo Leanos Jr. / NBC News\n\n\u201cI think using the terminology of Dreamer was showing people that no one gets to decide what your identity is and at the end of the day, she\u2019s not doing it just for herself, but for 11 million other undocumented immigrants\u201d Sibri said. \u201cThis campaign has allowed me to see the future.\u201d\n\nCruz said she has struggled with the fact she was formally undocumented and has often felt guilty that she's now a citizen. She's aware of the experiences she represents, and the opportunity that citizenship has given her.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who have the hopes and the dreams and are probably more qualified than I am to do this job, but they don\u2019t get to do it because they don\u2019t have a piece of paper,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nCruz wraps up her conversation with Anthony's family, but before she leaves their apartment, Anthony's father, Antonio, said they\u2019re going to watching to see if Cruz keeps her promises.\n\n\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t, then we\u2019re going to have to give her a little push,\u201d Antonio said jokingly.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

And the increases are seen in minority children, in particular.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why, but the researchers say their findings are startling. They are seeing the same pattern across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening. Community resources for mental health, especially for youth, are incredibly scarce,\u201d said Dr. Anna Abrams, a pediatrician and researcher at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking, really.\u201d\n\nAbrams is a pediatric emergency health physician studying disparities in health care at Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI started to see, in my clinical practice, increasing rates of mental health presentations,\u201d she told NBC News.\n\nShe decided to see if the same thing was happening nationally. She looked at data from 45 children\u2019s hospitals across the country from 2012 to 2016.\n\n\u201cWe saw about a 55 percent increase over the entire period in mental health presentations,\u201d Abrams said.\n\n\u201cAmong white children, it was a similar number, about 48 percent. Then when we looked at non-Hispanic black population, the five year increase was 64 percent and among the Hispanic population, that five-year increase was 77 percent,\u201d she added. \u201cThere were huge differences.\u201d\n\nAbrams and colleagues are presenting their findings to a meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics that starts Friday.\n\nIn 2012, they found, 50.4 emergency department visits per 100,000 visits by children were for mental health-related concerns. By 2016, mental health was the cause for 78.5 emergency department visits per 100,000 children.\n\n\u201cWhen stratified by race and ethnicity, mental health-related visits to the nation\u2019s emergency departments rose for non-Latino black children and adolescents at almost double the rate seen for non-Latino white children and adolescents,\u201d said Dr. Monika Goyal, director of research in emergency medicine at Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAccess to mental health services among children can be difficult, and data suggest that it can be even more challenging for minority children compared with non-minority youths.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also noted a rise in mental health problems, especially major depression, across the country as a whole and among teenagers in particular.\n\nThe CDC says one in five children ages 3 through 17 \u2014 about 15 million \u2014 have a diagnosable mental, emotional or behavioral disorder in a given year. But only 20 percent of them get diagnosed or receive care.\n\nThe average age of children being brought in for acute mental health crises was 13, the team found.\n\n\u201cOne of our other analyses showed that during our study period, a non-Hispanic black child was 1.5 times more likely to present to an emergency department with a mental health complaint than a white child. The numbers are just staggering,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nAbrams said a combination of factors is likely causing the increases.\n\n\u201cWe can speculate, but we can\u2019t say for sure what is happening,\u201d she said. In part, it could be due to the scarcity of mental health professionals who can help children. There\u2019s also clearly a real increase in some mental health issues.\n\nPeople are also talking more openly about depression, anxiety and other common mental health problems and that may make parents feel more comfortable about seeking help for their children, Abrams said. But it can be difficult to find specialized care.\n\n\u201cLarge numbers of children never see a specialty healthcare provider,\u201d she said. \u201cMany, many times these kids need specialty mental health care that goes beyond the capability of a general pediatrician.\u201d", "Fact check: Are Dems the 'party of crime' as Trump claims? copied!\n\nDonald Trump casts Democrats as the \u201cparty of crime,\" embracing wide-open borders, providing safe harbor for MS-13 and ending all immigration enforcement.

The county is home to about 3,000 people who live in the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and are eligible to vote; so far, more than 200 absentee ballots from there have been filled out and returned, the group said.\n\nThat number already outpaces the most recent statewide elections, when more than 120 absentee ballots were returned in Sioux County in 2016 and 59 were returned in 2014, election results show.\n\nAccording to the state, there are currently six precincts in Sioux County, boundaries that went into effect with the 2012 election. In the 2010 election, a 2010 Census map shows seven precincts, although the Sioux County auditor said there were actually eight at the time.\n\nOJ Semans, the co-executive director of Four Directions, said he's wary because while the state and county verify the six precincts, the group has not been provided any \"legal descriptions or any memoranda adopted by official action\" to support how those precincts were mapped by the county auditor.\n\n\"The Auditor has told us she has no such documents and your office has told us that you have no such documents,\" Semans wrote to Jaeger.\n\nJaeger referred him to \"appropriate county officials\" because the state \"has no jurisdictional oversight.\"\n\nFour Directions said it did receive photocopied maps from Sioux County Auditor Barbara Hettich showing precincts that were hand-drawn. \"If you've ever seen anything unofficial, it looks like that,\" Semans said Friday.\n\nHettich said that the county does not have the capability to use maps that aren't hand-drawn, but invited residents to verify their precincts at the auditor's office.\n\n\"We have maps on the wall and they can see,\" she said.\n\nSemans said his group just wants peace of mind that a person is voting in the correct place or an absentee ballot will not have to be tossed because they were in the wrong precinct caused by boundary discrepancies.\n\nVoting rights groups have gotten mixed messages from local election officials on other issues as well, including what color pen people who fill out absentee ballots must use. (The state has confirmed that both black and blue are acceptable.)\n\nThe number is part of a wider voter outreach effort that has gained national attention and is critical in a state where incumbent Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp won by fewer than 3,000 votes in 2012. Native Americans, who largely vote Democratic, helped to tip that race in her favor. Recent polls, however, have given Heitkamp's GOP challenger, Rep. Kevin Cramer, a double-digit lead \u2014 and his win would help Republicans to cement their slim majority in the Senate.\n\nThis election comes amid a change early last month in the state's voter ID law requiring residents to have a street address on their state-issued IDs. Residents who live on tribal reservations are allowed to use their federally recognized tribal IDs to vote \u2014 but many Native Americans have post office boxes, not street addresses, listed on them.\n\nThat has forced potentially 5,000 people without qualifying IDs to get new ones in time for Tuesday's election. Voter rights groups have been scrambling to help tribal citizens figure out their street addresses \u2014 in some cases a haphazard process \u2014 and the tribes have been offering IDs for free through Election Day.\n\nAt least 2,000 people have gotten new IDs since the law was changed, according to tribal officials across North Dakota.\n\nOn Thursday, a district court judge denied a last-minute emergency request by the Spirit Lake Tribe to put a halt to the street address requirement.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Those without voter ID can sign a form attesting that they do not have photo ID or do not have it with them, the ACLU told local outlets.\n\nThe spate of new laws, which were placed on the books almost exclusively in red states, come despite the lack of proof that voter impersonation is anything more than a minuscule problem.\n\nJustin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School and former Department of Justice official who has been studying the issue for years, said he found just 45 credible cases of voter impersonation between 2000 and 2018, a period during which more than a billion votes were cast.\n\nSo why the insistence on new voter ID requirements?\n\n\"Some of it might be perceived political advantage (as an issue), some of it might be perceived electoral advantage, some of it might be animus toward populations without the required kind of ID,\" Levitt said in an email to NBC News. \"Some of it might be lack of understanding of the injuries caused by requirements that are difficult for real eligible voters to meet, and some of it might be lack of empathy for those injuries.

The policies hit minorities hard: the AP investigation found that 70 percent of the people put in limbo were African-American.\n\nCivil rights groups sued Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, the Republican candidate in the state's hotly contested gubernatorial race and the state's top elections official, over the exact match policy. A federal judge also barred Georgia officials from tossing absentee ballots where the voter's signature doesn\u2019t match exactly. Voters must be given a chance to rectify the discrepancy, a judge said.\n\nOn Friday, a federal judge also ruled against Kemp in a suit over some 3,000 voters flagged as potential noncitizens, telling the state to establish procedures that guarantee those voters a ballot if they can prove their citizenship.\n\nBig purges in four states\n\nWest Virginia, Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina are purging voters aggressively, the Brennan Center has reported, raising concerns that eligible voters could be accidentally purged. While purging out-of-date registrations from the polls is a normal part of election administration, voting rights advocates say purges must be done precisely.\n\nWest Virginia's secretary of state announced in September that it had purged more than 100,000 voters from its voter rolls, which now has 1.27 million voters.\n\nPurged voters given the right to vote in Ohio\n\nAfter the Supreme Court gave the all-clear to Ohio's voter purge process \u2014 which boots voters who don\u2019t cast ballots for three federal elections and ignore a confirmation notice from election officials \u2014 voting rights advocates took the state to court over purge confirmation notices, which they argued were too vague. A judge ruled this week that purged voters could still vote, while advocates continued to challenge the wording of the confirmation notice.\n\nMeanwhile in Gotham\n\nThe New York City Campaign Finance Board may have unwittingly sabotaged its own get out the vote drive by stating falsely \u2014 in a midterm elections guide sent to millions of residents \u2014 that paroled felons are barred from voting.\n\nThe board apologized for the mistake and quickly made the fix online.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Leigh Ann Caldwell and Laura Strickler\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats are seeking more information about President Donald Trump\u2019s involvement in the decision to scrap plans to move the FBI\u2019s headquarters to the Washington suburbs, pointing to new documents that show keeping the headquarters in its current location will cost taxpayers millions of dollars.\n\nIn the letter, sent to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly on Friday, Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are asking for all documents between Trump officials, the Trump Organization and related government agencies about the decision not to relocate the FBI\u2019s headquarters, a move that had been long-discussed.\n\nFive House Democrats, led by ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings, charge that Trump did not want to move the location of the FBI headquarters from downtown Washington, D.C. to the suburbs, because the empty land could become a business or hotel that could compete with the Trump Hotel across the street. Trump, before he was president, was interested in developing the FBI property.\n\nIn the letter, Democrats point to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019 assessment that \"the president wanted to save the government money, and also the FBI leadership did not want to move its headquarters.\"\n\nBut documents obtained by the committee show that White House officials knew that keeping the headquarters in its current location would cost taxpayers \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars.\n\nIn an email obtained by the committee dated February 13, 2018, a Deputy Associate Director at the Office of Management and Budget concedes the new plan to rebuild the FBI headquarters downtown as opposed to the suburbs is both more costly and less secure.\n\nIn his email, Andrew Abrams appears to be preparing the FBI and GSA for a tough Congressional hearing by suggesting the most difficult question they could face from members of Congress: \"Compared to the procurement plan that FBI and GSA terminated a year ago the current \u2026 plan proposes a less secure facility and has a higher cost per seat.\" the email reads.\n\nAn August report by the Inspector General notes that demolishing and rebuilding the FBI headquarters instead of building a new building in the suburbs would mean an additional cost of $64,834 per employee.\n\n\"These new documents raise serious questions about whether Ms. Sanders issued her statements with knowledge of these facts, or, alternatively, without taking basic steps to confirm their accuracy. Either way, the White House should not be issuing false claims to justify or conceal President Trump\u2019s conflicts of interest on this matter,\" Cummings writes.\n\nThe White House has not responded to a request for a response to the letter.\n\nLast January, days before the General Services Administration announced it was ditching the suburban plan and embracing a new plan to demolish the FBI building and build a new facility on the same location, President Trump met with the head of the GSA in the Oval Office according to a White House photograph.\n\nBut when Murphy testified before Congress about the decision to go with the downtown headquarters in April she was asked about White House involvement and did not disclose meeting with the President according to the IG report.\n\nThe new headquarters in the suburbs would have accommodated 10,606 FBI staff but the plan to stay downtown would only give enough space for 8,300 meaning other staff would have to be located elsewhere at additional cost according to the IG report. The new plan also sacrifices the revenue the government would have received from the lucrative sale of the downtown property to a developer.", "By Nicole Acevedo\n\nColombian-American award-winning poet and actor Carlos Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez, 36, is pretty open about his emotions and his active role as a father.\n\n\u201cI cry every day, I change my daughter's diapers,\u201d G\u00f3mez told NBC News.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t always like that.\n\nThe author of the memoir Man Up: Reimagining Modern Manhood and actor (he was in Spike Lee's \"Inside Man\") remembers growing up believing that in order to be a man he needed to be ready to fight at all times, objectify women and suppress his emotional self.\n\n\u201cI think of myself at 17, I remember feeling this pressure to conform to this one dimension of masculinity... be part of a culture that doesn\u2019t represent the person that I\u2019m inside,\u201d G\u00f3mez said.\n\nAfter making a life in New York with his wife and two little girls, G\u00f3mez decided to unlearn what he was taught about masculinity and embarked on a mission \u201cto dismantle the stereotype about what it means to be a man.\u201d\n\nG\u00f3mez\u2019s tipping point was years ago when he was a very young man. He accidentally bumped into another man at a club, immediately triggering a confrontation. But just when they were about to start fighting, G\u00f3mez experienced a sudden surge of emotions that brought him to tears. He was taken aback by how people reacted to his emotional display \u201cas if crying, or showing vulnerability, was the most insane thing.\u201d\n\nSince then, G\u00f3mez has been on a mission to promote positivity and self-expression, going around the country and spreading the message through spoken word, poetry, TEDx Talks and a book, challenging toxic masculinity behaviors that often fuel bullying and \u201clocker room talk.\u201d\n\nSome scholars have used the term toxic masculinity to refer to what are considered \u201cstereotypical masculine gender roles\u201d such as limiting the kinds of emotions boys and men are allowed to express and imposing social expectations that men seek to be dominant or aggressive.\n\nIn some parts of Latin America, aggressive concepts of masculine pride are perpetrated by what\u2019s known as machismo culture.\n\nIn one of G\u00f3mez\u2019s most recent efforts to eradicate these behaviors, he partnered with AXE and rapper KYLE for #SeniorOrientation, an initiative that Grammy-award winning artist John Legend launched last year to encourage high school seniors to foster an environment of inclusive masculinity.\n\nG\u00f3mez and KYLE visited high schools in California and Chicago during the month of October, which is considered to be National Bullying Prevention Month, to motivate high school seniors to encourage others to own the way they each express their masculinity setting an example by allowing themselves to be vulnerable and honest about their emotions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one way to be a man,\u201d G\u00f3mez said. \u201cEven though change is a scary thing, even if it's for the better, we can set that tone to act unapologetically.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Haq had regularly called Omar one of his best students.\n\n\u201cThey are my students. In our tradition, a teacher is like a father, like a spiritual leader,\u201d Haq told Reuters in 2013. \u201cAfghans should be allowed to fight for their freedom.

Bill Nelson's team, which is attempting to argue that all 588,000-plus ballots in Palm Beach County for the Senate race should be hand recounted. It's unclear how that ruling will come down, but it\u2019s being heard today.\n\nHere are the week\u2019s top cases, how they were ruled on and why it matters. These may change and more cases could be added but here is the current state of play:\n\nDemocratic Executive Committee of Florida vs. FL Secretary of State Ken Detzner\n\nThe issue: Signature matching on vote-by-mail, absentee, and provisional ballots.\n\nThe ruling: In favor of Democrats \u2014 signature matching deadline is extended until Saturday at 5 p.m. Republican lawyers filed an appeal in circuit court, which was then denied.\n\nWhat does it mean? About 4,000 voters whose ballots were rejected due to signature matching issues now have an opportunity to \u201ccure\u201d or rectify those issues so that their vote may be counted.\n\nVote Vets, DNC, DSCC vs. Detzner\n\nThe issue: Deadlines for vote-by mail ballots and whether they should be counted based on when they are received by counties OR when they are postmarked (current rule says when they are received).\n\nThe ruling: None yet.\n\nWhat does it mean? If a judge were to rule that ballots should be counted based on when they are post-marked, not when they are received, it would put thousands more votes into play statewide.\n\nDSCC v. Detzner\n\nThe issue: How voter intent is judged during a hand recount.\n\nThe ruling: Judge Mark Walker said rules about voter intent \u2014 consistency and \u201cmagic words\u201d \u2014 are Constitutional, a decision that went against the Democratic side.\n\nWhat does it mean? For voters who didn\u2019t fill out the ballot correctly, consistent use of X\u2019s, O\u2019s, stars, etc. throughout a ballot shows a clear voter intent, as does explicitly writing \u201cVote for [Candidate]\u201d.\n\nDSCC v. Detzner\n\nThe issue: Extending deadlines for counties to complete their machine recounts\n\nThe ruling: The judge denied Democrats' request for counties to get more time for their machine recounts. This case was filed and decided on before Thursday\u2019s 3 p.m. deadline for counties to finish their machine recounts.\n\nWhat does it mean? Counties, like Palm Beach, and others who didn\u2019t finish their machine recount by the 3 p.m. Thursday deadline were not given more time to do so by the court.\n\nLeague of Women Voters and Common Cause vs. Rick Scott\n\nThe issue: That GOP Gov. Rick Scott should recuse himself in his capacity as governor from anything having to do with the recount process. (Reminder: Scott did recuse himself on Wednesday, as he had done in his previous 2014 election, kind of rendering this case moot).\n\nThe ruling: Request rejected \u2014 but with some choice words for how Rick Scott has conducted himself during this process. Judge Walker described the governor as \u201ccareening perilously close to a due process violation\u201d because of his press conference held in front of the FL Gov\u2019s mansion on Nov.8th.\n\nWhat does it mean? Not much. Scott is an elected official who is running for office, so he can\u2019t do much about the fact that he\u2019s governor while running for Senate. And he already recused himself before this case was heard, so tangible action was kind of impossible from the court.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Ani Bundel\n\nWhen news broke of the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi from the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, international condemnation was (mostly) swift. Although U.S. President Donald Trump spent days twiddling his thumbs and protesting that the kingdom should be considered innocent until proven guilty, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared all deals between her country and Saudi Arabia were suspended for the time being. Companies like J.P. Morgan and Google pulled out of a global investor\u2019s conference dubbed the \u201cDavos in the Desert.\u201d Even U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, UK trade minister Liam Fox and World Bank president Jim Yong Kim eventually stayed away too.\n\nBut Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman still has some friends left. Despite the protests of both fans and WWE stars, Vince and Linda McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment are continuing their partnership with the kingdom as if nothing has happened. On Friday, the WWE presents a huge pay-per-view event live from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia called \u201cCrown Jewel.\u201d\n\nIt is now clear that Khashoggi was murdered and his body dismembered in October, a shockingly brazen act (and attempted cover-up) carried out by agents of Saudi Arabia on foreign soil. Besides causing an international incident, Saudi\u2019s brutality has undermined the young crown prince\u2019s perception as a reformer. Case in point, the government sponsored high-profile initiative known as Saudi Vision 2030. This \u201cvision\u201d was mainly a pivot away from oil and towards recreation and tourism. The country partnered with Disney, for instance, to run \u201cBlack Panther\u201d in theaters, the first American movie to break the country\u2019s cinema ban in 35 years.\n\nIn this context, a partnership with professional wrestling was not surprising. The wrestling franchise is incredibly lucrative, as highlighted by its recent, $1 billion, five-year deal to air \u201cSmackdown\u201d on the Fox broadcast network starting in October of 2019. The WWE Network, the company\u2019s standalone streaming channel, has been an overwhelming success. Having conquered most of the North American continent and the UK, the franchise has already launched other initiatives overseas, including in India and China. A foothold in the Middle East feels like a logical next step.\n\nBut this foothold comes with a steep moral price. Not only does the McMahon family have to overlook the Saudi government\u2019s glaring human rights abuses, it must also comply with Saudi \u201cdecency\u201d laws which are used most often to police women\u2019s bodies. To that end, the WWE agreed to bring zero women with them to Saudi Arabia to perform.\n\nNot only does the McMahon family have to overlook the Saudi government\u2019s glaring human rights abuses, it must also comply with Saudi \u201cdecency\u201d laws.\n\nThe WWE has long functioned like a weird traveling circus which holds up a funhouse mirror to our current society mores. Want to know who Middle America things the current enemies are? Turn on WWE\u2019s flagship show, \u201cRaw,\u201d on USA and see who is playing the obvious \u201cvillain\u201d character. (This is one of the many things Netflix\u2019s \u201cGLOW\u201d gets right about the business.) Thus, in 2016 and at the height of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the WWE made a forceful push of its own to bring gender equality to its shows.\n\nFor decades, women\u2019s matches were, to put it bluntly, beer breaks. Labeled as the \u201cDivas\u201d division from 2008-2016, female wrestlers like Michelle McCool and the Bella Twins competed over a \u201cButterfly Belt\u201d fit for a Barbie doll. (It was pink and purple and shaped like a butterfly.) More serious matches involved hair pulling. Nearly all the \u201cdivas\u201d pulled double duties as pin-ups and reality show stars.\n\nEvery so often, someone like Beth Phoenix or Chyna would gain some semblance of fame on their own, but the show never knew what to do with them, alternately presenting them as freaks or over-feminizing them for ridicule, putting them in outfits that didn\u2019t fit and having matches that revolved around their underwear. In short, almost no one took women\u2019s wrestling seriously in this testosterone-fueled business.\n\nBut that\u2019s changing. The WWE has added an impressive roster of real wrestlers, including MMA star Rhonda Rousey. The \u201cDivas\u201d label was technically discontinued in 2016. The belts women compete for are now comparable to the ones held by the men. Over the last year, women have also participated in matches once reserved only for men, like the Iron Man and Steel Cage matches.\n\nAnd on Oct. 28, 2018, the WWE held its first all-female pay-per-view special, \"WWE Evolution,\" proving that the franchise\u2019s female roster is now robust enough to support a four-hour extravaganza. WWE Evolution featured matches of a historical nature, where women like Charlotte Flair (daughter of WWE legend Ric Flair) fought their opponents using tables, ladders and chairs. It may sound ridiculous, but when Becky Lynch launched herself from the top of an 8-foot ladder, the crash you heard when the announcer\u2019s table collapsed was akin to wrestling\u2019s glass ceiling being shattered.\n\nThat the WWE would travel to Saudi Arabia leaving close to 50 percent of its roster behind is a serious step backwards. (As a result, the franchise was also forced to pull several male wrestlers out of retirement to fill out the card, even before some wrestlers began individually dropping out.)\n\nThe erasure of women during the WWE\u2019s first Saudi pay-per-view shot, \u201cThe Greatest Royal Rumble,\u201d held back in March, was downright creepy. One promo with a few seconds long shot of female wrestlers stayed in, causing a fuss in Saudi Arabia and prompting a promise that it would not happen again.\n\nThe WWE insists it plays along with the laws for now but hopes that it can help modernize the culture incrementally. In interviews, executives claimed the decision to not cancel \u201cCrown Jewel\u201d was a tough one. Given the circumstances, though, craven, money grubbing or just downright spineless feel like more apt descriptors.", "By Suzanne Gamboa\n\nAs President Donald Trump has called for an end birthright citizenship, the nation has been experiencing a steep drop in the number of babies born to undocumented immigrant parents, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nAbout 250,000 babies were born to undocumented immigrant parents in 2016, compared to 390,000 in 2007; a 36 percent drop, the center reported.\n\nIn 2016, babies born to undocumented parents represented about 6 percent of the 4 million births in the country; in 2007, they were 9 percent of total births.\n\nPew points out that it's important to keep in mind that the immigration status of parents can change over time. There may be parents who had legal permission to be in the U.S. when their child was born but later overstayed their visas, for example. Also, parents may have lacked legal documentation when the child was born but later obtained green cards and citizenship.\n\nPew estimates that about 5 million children under 18 who were born in the U.S. live with at least one parent who lacks legal status. But that number has \"leveled off,\" Pew notes, due to a decrease in the number of undocumented immigrants following the Great Recession as well as fewer births.\n\nThis past week Trump said he would sign an executive order to change birthright citizenship, which is the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and guarantees that any child born on U.S. soil (with the exception of a child born to diplomats) is a U.S. citizen. Trump said he had the legal power to do this, although most legal scholars disagree.\n\nAccording to a Sept. 2017 NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey, 65 percent of Americans said birthright citizenship should continue, while 30 percent said it should end.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., responded to his taunts of \u201cPocahontas\u201d by releasing genetic information, that episode was an outlier among Democrats the president has attacked by name \u2014 and one that many of them say provided proof for the theory that he shouldn\u2019t be fought on the ground he chooses.\n\nInstead, most of the party has pushed back \u2014 gently \u2014 without rushing to cameras to fight on cultural issues at a time when they believe they have the upper hand in the battle for control of the House and are still in the hunt for several Senate races within the margin of error in recent polling.\n\n\"It\u2019s clear that President Trump is engaged in a cynical political effort to distract voters in the final days of this election, but our candidates have remained focused on what voters care about most \u2014 pocketbook issues like the cost of health care and protections for people with pre-existing health conditions,\" Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said over email. \"While the President is reduced to scare tactics, Democrats are fighting to help the families they represent.\"\n\nIt's not a coordinated strategy so much as a collective assessment that it's smart to avoid obvious traps Trump is laying in what they believe to be an increasingly desperate attempt to knock Democrats off their message.\n\nIn other words, Democrats are in array.\n\n\"I'm elated that my side isn't taking the bait,\" said Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa. \"For me, it's not coming from any sort of top-down dictate. That's my own judgment and has been for a long time. But I will say Nancy and others are of exactly the same mind.\"\n\n\"Nancy,\" of course, is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a frequent target of Trump's criticism who earlier this year gave him a campaign-trail talking point when she lamented his use of the word \"animals\" to describe certain undocumented immigrants. While Trump said he was referring to MS-13 gang members, and others interpreted him to mean immigrants more broadly, Pelosi said the term shouldn't be applied to any human beings.\n\nTrump said Pelosi \"went crazy\" because she \"loves MS-13.\"\n\nSince then, Pelosi \u2014 who hopes to become House speaker again \u2014 has given Trump precious little to work with. A longtime advocate for the LGBTQ community, she chose not to engage with Trump on the rights of transgender students when he raised them late last month. An aide told NBC at the time that Pelosi supports a bill that would expand the Civil Rights Act to cover sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nAfter the delivery of pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and the murders of 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Pelosi sent her colleagues a letter reminding them to keep their eyes on the path to winning a House majority next week.\n\n\"While the GOP attempts to divide and distract the public from their tax scam for the rich and their assault on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and people with pre-existing conditions, Democrats across the country are focused on bringing people together,\" she wrote. \"In this all important final week, only by relentlessly driving home our For The People message of health, jobs and integrity in government will we win a better future for all Americans.\"\n\nDemocrats say that their low-key reactions are a data point demonstrating their ability to be a responsible governing party if voters give them control of the House. They see a president making the contrast obvious for them with his behavior over the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nWhen Trump abruptly changed the number of troops he planned to send to the border from 5,200 \u2014 the number announced by the Pentagon \u2014 to as many as 15,000, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., admonished fellow Democrats to take a deep breath.\n\n\"Dear Democratic candidates: this is a trap. Don\u2019t fall for it. We\u2019ll fight this after the election if it\u2019s actually a real thing,\" Murphy wrote on Twitter. \"For the next 6 days, focus on health care and tax cuts for billionaires and corporations.\"\n\nIn the closing days of the campaign, Trump's strategy has been to try to keep the spotlight on his blitz against his top targets.

The story follows its main character, Jared, to a conversion therapy program where young men and women \u2014 including Sivan\u2019s character, Gary \u2014 are forced to publicly confess their perceived impure thoughts and deviant acts while wearing drab uniforms reminiscent of prison garb. In one particularly haunting scene, a boy is repeatedly hit with a Bible in an effort to literally beat his homosexuality out of him.\n\nThe world portrayed in the film, however, could not be further from the one in which Sivan lives in real life. The confident, 23-year-old entertainer represents a new generation of gay male pop star \u2014 one that never had to \u201ccome out\u201d while famous, and as a result has been accepted since the beginning.\n\nPrior to signing a record deal, appearing on the cover of Rolling Stone, performing on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and selling out Radio City Music Hall, the internet-born star publicly came out on his own YouTube channel in 2013. The video has been viewed over 8 million times.\n\nSivan\u2019s flashy stage persona makes it jarring to see him as the quiet, inhibited Gary in \u201cBoy Erased,\u201d which hits theaters on Nov. 2 (\u201cBoy Erased\u201d is being released by Focus Features, which, like NBC News, is part of Comcast/NBCUniversal). The film was written and directed by Joel Edgerton and, along with Sivan, stars Oscar-nominee Lucas Hedges as Jared and Oscar winners Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe as Jared\u2019s concerned parents, who sent their son to so-called gay conversion therapy.\n\nSivan said filming \u201cBoy Erased\u201d was an emotional experience for him that \u201cdefinitely struck a chord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kept remembering how vulnerable I was at that time in my life, when I was first coming to terms with myself and coming out to my parents,\u201d Sivan told NBC News. \u201cHad I not been lucky enough to have the kind of family I had that was so supportive, I don't know where I'd be today, or who I would be today, or if I'd be here today.\u201d\n\nTroye Sivan performs on Today on May 28, 2018. Nathan Congleton / TODAY\n\nConversion therapy is an attempt to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity. It has been discredited by medical and mental-health associations, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., have laws banning the practice for minors, according to LGBTQ think thank Movement Advancement Project.\n\n\u201cThere's a really tangible result that we're all trying to achieve with this movie,\u201d Sivan said, \u201cwhich is first and foremost to start conversations and then hopefully end up where there's 50 laws in 50 states that prevent youth from going to conversion therapy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, approximately 700,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults have undergone conversion therapy at some point in their lives, including about 350,000 who received this treatment as adolescents.\n\nSivan, with his 9 million Instagram followers, said he isn\u2019t aiming to talk to his rabid fanbase with \u201cBoy Erased.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith my fans, it\u2019s sort of preaching to the choir. They are all on the same page as I am about this kind of thing,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe people that I'm really trying to communicate with [in] this film are parents and people who would disagree with me.\u201d\n\nThe stark contrast between the world of \u201cBoy Erased\u201d and his own life was not lost on Sivan while filming.\n\n\u201cThe craziest thing for me was I was about 70 percent done with [my album \u201cBloom\u201d] when I went to go shoot this movie. I put everything on pause and completely immersed myself in the film,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I got to come back to my real life, which I now realize couldn't be any further from the film and the story that we're telling. I just felt so lucky that at the end of the day, I got to go home and keep making my gay album.\u201d\n\nHis so-called gay album \u2014 which includes a track The New York Times described as a \"coded anal sex anthem\" \u2014 debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart, marking Sivan\u2019s best album sales to date and his fourth top 10 hit . It also features the folksy breakup tune \u201cThe Good Side,\u201d a song that director Edgerton chose to open the film.\n\nLucas Hedges, from left, Joel Edgerton, Troye Sivan and Nicole Kidman arrive at the Los Angeles premiere of \"Boy Erased\" on Oct. 29, 2018, at the Directors Guild of America. Jordan Strauss / Invision/AP\n\nWhen Sivan was cast, he immediately offered Edgerton his musical talents as well, offering to make any of his published songs available and to write original ones for the film. Sivan said he wrote six songs right off the bat, none of which felt right, until Edgerton shared with him a scene from the middle of the film where Jared, in the midst of grappling with his sexuality, shares a quiet, almost sacred moment with a young man he meets. Sivan\u2019s dreamlike ballad, \u201cRevelation,\u201d co-written with Icelandic musician J\u00f3nsi, is the result.\n\n\u201cIt's this moment of relief in the film that I was so touched by,\u201d Sivan said. \u201cYou get to breathe for the first time as an audience member as you're watching it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJared has this really sweet, pure, tender moment, and the sky doesn't fall down on him, and the world doesn't stop spinning,\u201d he continued. \u201c That\u2019s like a revelation for him. We ended up writing the song about that specific moment and how that moment shapes him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoy Erased\u201d marks Sivan\u2019s return to acting. His most notable past role was playing a young Hugh Jackman \u2014 a fellow Aussie \u2014 in 2009\u2019s \u201cX-Men Origins: Wolverine.\u201d He makes his big-screen return next to some of Australia\u2019s other acting titans: Kidman, Crowe and Edgerton. For this coincidence, Sivan has a simple explanation: \u201cThere actually is an Australian Illuminati, and we organize these things.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Two taken to Oregon hospital after eating Halloween candy laced with meth copied!\n\nTwo Oregon parents were taken to a hospital Thursday after unknowingly eating methamphetamine-laced gummy candy their children received while trick-or-treating.

In generations past, employees were taught to just suck it up and deal. You don\u2019t argue with the boss, you appease him. You don\u2019t tell her she\u2019s being unclear in an assignment, you try and clarify for yourself because you don\u2019t want her to doubt your ability to execute.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty lopsided system, and one that has put the onus to change on the employee. Fortunately, the tide is turning as millennials jump ship from companies (and managers) that are not treating them well.\n\n\u201cThat old-school system where the boss sits in an ivory tower and passed judgment on people or treat them like commodities is gone,\u201d says Phyllis Horner, PhD, founder, Thriving Work Life Design and author of \u201cPowerful Choices for Mid-Career Women: How to Create Your Personal Pathway to Meaning, Prosperity and Your Next Great Job.\u201d \u201cOlder generations are looking to the millennial mindset and realizing that they\u2019re right: we shouldn\u2019t have just stick it out and wait for things to get better. It\u2019s not good for a person of any age.\u201d\n\nSo bosses, it\u2019s now on you to own up to your aggravating behaviors and make real changes in your leadership tactics if you want to succeed.\n\nLinkedIn finds that unclear expectations, micromanaging top the list of complaints\n\nBosses should take heed of a new LinkedIn Learning Survey revealing employees\u2019 top complaints about their bosses. According to the near 3,000 polled, these are the most frustrating behaviors of managers that may lead to one quitting a job:\n\nHaving expectations that aren\u2019t clear or frequently change\n\nMicromanaging\n\nThey are unavailable or\n\nNot fostering professional development.\n\nIf you\u2019re a boss displaying any of these behaviors, how can you change your ways? Bosses and leadership experts weigh in with their best tips for improvement.\n\nEncourage questions and be honest about what you don\u2019t know\n\n\u201cWhen a good boss sets unclear expectations, it\u2019s often because what has been handed down to them, as an employee too, is vague, but they are required to pass it down, so they do,\u201d says Horner.\n\nBosses can be reluctant to admit their own lack of omniscience around a newly commissioned task, which can result in them expecting those under them to figure it out. Instead, they should be transparent and encourage questions that they can get answered, even if it means going back to their own boss or board.\n\n\u201cSay to your employees, \u2018Do you have any questions that would help us be successful with this?\u2019 I will then go back and find out the answers,\u201d Horner says. \u201cThen follow up and get back to your team. Leveling it that way makes people feel empowered and enabled because you're willing to be the go-between. Also, be sure to give credit by saying things like, \u2018that\u2019s a great question\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis approach may be helpful even if you do have a solid idea of the task at hand.\n\nImplement \u2018listening checks\u2019 in meeting\n\nA practical tool to use when communicating expectations is to give \u2018listening checks,\u2019 says Vanessa Ridley-Gray, VP, product operations at ZeroCater.\n\n\"I have learned that bosses and employees can both listen more effectively and seek clarity to ensure they are on the same page,\u201d says Ridley-Gray. \u201cWhen I am in a meeting, I say, \u2018Can I do a listening check?\u2019 I then repeat what I thought I heard and ask for confirmation. I encourage my team to do the same. This ensures we are clear [and] accountable to each other.\"\n\nMicromanaging? Check your own stress and have an open conversation about goals\n\nIf you\u2019re hovering a little too closely over how your employees are performing, you\u2019re probably under extra pressure yourself to perform well.\n\n\u201cI teach that, even in a crisis, when the pressure is on you as the boss and it's tricky to know how to respond to it because you feel out of control, how do you handle stress yourself without dropping it on employees? It\u2019s usually through micromanaging,\u201d notes Horner.\n\nYou may not even realize you\u2019re micromanaging, but your employees will, and it will likely upset them. So, in addition to taking the time and care to ease your own stress, make an effort to show your employees that you trust them.\n\n\u201cCommunicate to your employees that there\u2019s a bottom line that needs to happen, and explain to your employees the challenge and how you're committed to their success as well as the company\u2019s,\u201d says Horner. \u201cIf there\u2019s something you have to instruct them on, like if you\u2019re bringing in a new technology, let them know you\u2019re doing so not because you don\u2019t trust their ability, but because we\u2019re all learning. Have an open conversation that let\u2019s everyone know, \u2018together we will make this work.\u2019\u201d\n\nBe mindful that everyone is different. Some people will pick up a new skill more quickly than others. This doesn\u2019t mean the one that lags is less capable, nor does it mean that you have to helicopter-manage those struggling.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to read that someone knows how to do something, then ask then, can you teach the next person this? This is how you escape the trap of micromanaging,\u201d says Horner.\n\nEven ultra busy introverts have no excuse for being absent\n\nYou may truly value your team, but perhaps because you\u2019re so absorbed in your own work, or an introvert, your employees are mistaking you for being aloof, which can be a deal breaker for them, Horner notes. Or, you\u2019re just not all that available, which is also problematic, for obvious reasons.\n\nThe answer to handling these issues is simple, but not necessarily easy. You have to get out there and be real with your team in an approachable, genuine manner.\n\n\u201cAsk yourself, \u2018who am I role-modeling after? It\u2019s your responsibility to figure this out and right the ship,\u201d says Horner. \u201cI have counseled countless people to get out of their offices and walk around [the workspace].\u201d\n\nMerely the act of showing you\u2019re part of the team can be effective in revealing that you care and respect your employees and are on the same page as the are in terms of wanting success, but also being a human being. This may be uncomfortable for you if you\u2019re naturally withdrawn, but it\u2019s necessary and will likely be appreciated.\n\n\u201cI can't expect anyone else to get outside their comfort zone [and innovate] if I'm not first willing to get outside my own,\u201d says Mark Arsenault, executive director at Success Reentry, adding that this survey was a welcomed eye-opener for him. \u201cIt can be difficult to suppress one's ego for the sake of serving by example, but it's extremely important to do so.\u201d\n\nYour employees need to know they can grow at your company, invest in them\n\nHorner finds that many managers resist investing in developing their employees because there\u2019s a fear that they\u2019ll take the training, mentorship, education or whatever else they\u2019re learning to grow only to move companies a year later.\n\nThis may very well happen, but guess what? If you don\u2019t put those assets into growing your employee\u2019s marketable potential, you\u2019ve already lost them.\n\n\u201cAll the best companies today invest in inclusion and employee development,\u201d says Horner. \u201cThose companies who don\u2019t do the investing aren\u2019t [necessarily] short-sighted, they\u2019re thinking about dollars on the table. They\u2019re thinking that millennials won\u2019t stay and they\u2019ve just essentially given that [development] money to another company. But this is not just a financial relationship, it\u2019s a human one.\u201d\n\nNot investing in your workers\u2019 development will only cause them to seek out better opportunities, says Horner, and it could come back to hurt you later when you\u2019re looking to hire and word has spread on sites like Glassdoor that you don\u2019t value your talent enough to help them grow.\n\nIdeally, tackling your behavioral blind spots will help you focus more on these proactive measures, which can have a positive ripple effect throughout your team and company.\n\n\u201cMy weakness in communication flexibility made me realize that I needed to enable one of my team members, who is a far better communicator than me, to be the leader in our company from a daily-direction standpoint,\u201d says Josh Rubin, CEO of Post Modern Marketing. \u201cBringing her up to be a leader has already started paying off with our team, their attitude and productivity.\u201d\n\nTAKE YOUR CAREER TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nWant more tips like these?

The top line unemployment rate of 3.7 percent \u2014 unchanged from last month \u2014 was in line with expectations.\n\n\u201cThis is a really strong report. It\u2019s firing on all cylinders,\u201d said Josh Wright, chief economist at iCIMS, a hiring software company.\n\nFor the month, worker pay rose by 5 cents to $27.30, a 3.1 percent increase on an annualized basis and the biggest jump in wages since April 2009.\n\n\u201cWe're finally seeing wage growth pick up for more workers over the last few months and it's an upward trend I expect to see continue in the coming months if the economy remains on track,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor.\n\nChamberlain said that Glassdoor\u2019s Local Pay Reports indicated a 2.4 percent increase in October for workers across the board, but added that demand for high-tech talent in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Washington is driving gains that exceed the national average.\n\nWright said the strong growth in wages was even more remarkable in light of the fact that the average work week increased in October, as well. \u201cI\u2019m impressed they were able to maintain that strength,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that the hourly rate rose means it really was a strong pay month.\u201d\n\nOverall, labor market experts agreed that October\u2019s report marked a shift in the kind of metrics that have characterized much of the labor market recovery. \u201cThis is a very unique situation we\u2019re in,\u201d said Michael Stull, senior vice president of ManpowerGroup North America. \u201cTwo big pieces we look at \u2014 one is wage growth, the second is the participation rate \u2014 those really haven\u2019t moved in significant fashion the way we\u2019d expect them to move,\u201d he said.\n\nManpowerGroup\u2019s fourth-quarter Employment Outlook Survey found that 22 percent of companies surveyed expect to grow their head count, while 5 percent expect to shrink their workforce. \u201cWe still see hiring in general as remaining pretty positive. Certainly, this time of year it gets even tighter,\u201d Stull said.\n\nThat was borne out in positive results elsewhere, as well. ADP\u2019s private-sector jobs report published Wednesday also indicated positive momentum with a gain of 227,000 jobs.

Similarly, the state constitution of California, where Google\u2019s headquarters is located, provides, \u201cEvery person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of this right.\u201d\n\nGenerally, however, an infringement on speech or a protest can only be unconstitutional if it is fairly attributable to the government. Employees of private companies are often \u201cat will,\u201d which means they can be terminated for no cause. Sometimes workers have a written employment agreement with their employer which spells out acceptable conduct and terms of employment, but often this language favors the employer over the employee. Either way, a person's free speech rights under the federal and state constitutions are not infringed unless there is state action.\n\nThis does not mean the Google employees are completely unprotected or that they can be fired for their walkout.\n\nIn passing the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Congress intended to protect private employees when they organize collectively for their mutual aid and protection in the workplace. The NLRA provides that \u201cemployees shall have the right to ... engage in ... concerted activities for the purpose of \u2026 mutual aid or protection.\u201d\n\nGoogle employees stage a walkout over sexual harassment on Thursday in New York. Bryan R. Smith / AFP \u2014 Getty Images\n\nThe law makes it an unfair labor practice for the employer to interfere with or restrain employees in the exercise of these guaranteed rights. In fact, federal law \u201cexpressly foster[s]\u201d a \u201cfreewheeling use of the written and spoken word\u201d for employees in certain situations, according to the Supreme Court.\n\nBoth union and non-union employees have a right to act for the purpose of \"mutual aid or protection.\" This includes efforts to improve their conditions of employment, even if they use methods outside the immediate employee-employer relationship.\n\nFederal courts have acknowledged that employees who jointly participate in a walkout to present job-related grievances to management are engaged in protected concerted activity, regardless of whether or not the employees are members of a union.\n\nBut, if a walkout stops production and is only for the purpose of protesting over a supervisor, it might not be protected by the NLRA.\n\nIf Google employees had been only walking out to, say, protest the hiring of a particular supervisor, courts have indicated this might not be protected activity. The choice of supervisors is a management prerogative, one that employees don\u2019t automatically have a statutory right to \u201cbargain\u201d about.\n\nIn London, Google employees joined the walkout. Tolga Akmen / AFP \u2014 Getty Images\n\nOn the other hand, a walkout because that same supervisor's conduct is impairing the conditions of employment would be protected concerted activity.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the Google protests reacting to company action or inaction in dealing with supervisors are unprotected, depending on the specific reason for the walkout.\n\nThe law has to walk a line: protect employees\u2019 right to advocate for their protection while also preventing employees from going too far and vetoing any management decision just because it\u2019s unpopular. In the case of managers ignoring complaints or permitting sexual misconduct to occur, courts have suggested that this kind of conduct addresses workplace conditions.\n\nA walkout for this reason is likely protected by federal labor law, even if the First Amendment offers no protection.\n\nDanny Cevallos is an MSNBC legal analyst.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Erik Sherman\n\nThe White House announced Friday it is reimposing economic and trade sanctions on Iran, starting at midnight on Sunday. The move is intended to change the country's politics through economic pressure on its ability to sell oil. But the impact is likely to be small on world markets, and even possibly reduced, for now, on Iran itself.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump announced in May that the U.S. would pull out from the multi-party Iran nuclear deal and resume sanctions, global oil markets reacted quickly. Prices topped $85 a barrel, a four-year high. But the rally faded as markets digested the news and planned for the immediate future.\n\nFollowing Friday\u2019s announcement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, crude oil prices on Friday were actually down, not up. Brent crude oil was at around $72 a barrel and U.S. light crude was at just over $68, both down by around 18 percent since early October.\n\nThe reason is that Iranian production is a \"tertiary\" factor at best right now, according to Chirag Rathi, a consulting director with market research firm Frost & Sullivan.\n\nThe biggest issue affecting oil prices is the tension between the U.S. and China, which is causing a \"global trade war,\" said Rathi. When economic activity slows, there is less demand for oil, reducing price pressures \u2014 and the U.S. and China are the world's two largest oil consumers.\n\nThe second major factor is domestic oil production, which has continued to climb, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration figures. Also, U.S. stocks of crude oil have been climbing. The additional supply strengthens the effect of lowered demand on prices.\n\nFor now, possible little effect on Iran\n\nAlthough the intent of the sanctions is to hurt Iran economically, two factors may undermine the intent, at least in the short run. One is the list of eight countries that are reported to be on the exemptions list the administration has acknowledged.\n\nCountries such as China, India, South Korea, and Japan have all sought waivers and are rumored to have received them, with promises to limit imports. So, for now, exemptions have \"downgraded the effect of the sanctions,\" Rathi said.\n\nThe executive order of Aug. 6, 2018 that reimposed sanctions contained an exemption for natural gas, \"only if the financial transaction is solely for trade between the country with primary jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution and Iran, and any funds owed to Iran as a result of such trade are credited to an account located in the country with primary jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s 2013 executive order had identical language.\n\nIran produces much more natural gas than oil, noted Eric Anderson, a political scientist and former senior intelligence analyst for the CIA. \"There's a larger market for natural gas than straight raw oil product,\" Anderson told NBC News. \"The reason is natural gas is readily convertible into energy production of electricity.\"\n\nIt may be that the exception is a way to undercut Russian influence in Europe, as the country is also a significant exporter. But the results could help insulate Iran from some of the effects of the sanctions.", "Missouri mother claims son was lynched, despite police report copied!\n\nA Missouri mother and activist says she does not believe her son's death by hanging was a suicide, as ruled by police, and claims he was lynched instead.

It dictates how long and in what conditions the federal government can detain children. At the border, Customs and Border Protection is required to release children within 72 hours.\n\nThe facilities must \u201cprovide access to toilets and sinks, drinking water \u2026 adequate temperature control and ventilation, adequate supervision to protect minors from others, and contact with family,\u201d the agreement states.\n\n\u201cClearly President Trump cannot believe that his tents are facilities run by licensed programs as required by the Flores Agreements,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nThe suit also asks the court to \u201cnote that President Trump has begun hysterically asserting without any evidence that \u2018many criminals\u2019 and \u2018many gang members\u2019 are in this \u2018onslaught\u2019 of migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an effort to create fear and hysteria, Trump has gone so far as to call this \u201can invasion of our country,\u201d the suit says.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIf the Trump administration does detain and deport or block asylum seekers, it would also be in violation of international asylum law as well, said Scott Anderson, a David M.

Over glasses of wine and soft drinks, they diligently wrote postcards they would later mail to neighbors, requesting support for Felicia Stewart. Stewart, 41, is a businesswoman and a married lesbian mom of two working doggedly to unseat Republican incumbent David Faulkner, who represents the wealthiest state legislative district in Alabama.\n\nFifty-eight-year-old Barbara Saurer, who had just come in from an afternoon canvassing for Stewart, stood in the kitchen, recounting conversations she\u2019d had with residents, and talking about new friends she\u2019d made.\n\nVolunteers gather to write postcards supporting Felicia Stewart. Fergus Tuohy\n\n\u201cHi, Felicia!\u201d was the sassy slogan sported on Saurer\u2019s grey and blue T-shirt, the same catchphrase that appears on the countless yard signs that now blanket House District 46. Stewart\u2019s grassroots campaign has logged incalculable hours of canvassing, phone banking and letter-writing by a remarkably committed group of volunteers.\n\nSuch visible and enthusiastic support for a Democratic candidate is a new and astonishing phenomenon in this district, which winds through some of the most moneyed suburbs of Birmingham. It\u2019s been at least 16 years since a Democrat has run for this seat, and Donald Trump won the district's precincts by a margin of some 37 points. The prevalent conservative culture has long led progressives and moderates living here to keep their politics to themselves, often out of fear of social stigma.\n\n\"Hi, Felicia!\" is the sassy slogan sported on yard signs throughout District 46. Fergus Tuohy\n\nBut something has changed recently in these well-to-do suburbs. Since the 2016 election, large numbers of Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans have been coming out of the political closet to support Stewart and other Democratic candidates in a highly visible way. The forces behind this trend are varied, and locals report that this new visibility has raised the profiles of insurgent candidates in a manner that often makes them appealing to voters across the political aisle.\n\nTIPPING POINT\n\nMany observers point to Alabama\u2019s 2017 special election as the event that triggered this unusually visible and eager support for Democratic candidates. In the contest to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions upon his elevation to attorney general, Roy Moore won the GOP primary to become the Republican nominee.\n\nLong before the multiple accusations of sexual misconduct were leveled against him, Moore had been an unpopular figure among many Birmingham Republicans, who viewed him as a demagogue whose self-serving antics were harmful to the state\u2019s business interests and global image. By the time he ran for Senate, Moore had been twice removed from his position as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. The first time was in in 2003, for his refusal to comply with a federal court order to remove a monument to the Ten Commandments from his courtroom. The second was in 2016, for ordering probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Obergefell decision.\n\nFile photo: Roy Moore speaks during a campaign event at Jordan's Activity Barn on December 11, 2017 in Midland City, Alabama. Joe Raedle / Getty Images\n\nAlabamians of all political stripes were aghast at the prospect of Moore representing them in Washington and sought to elect his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, a former federal attorney, who had prosecuted two of the Klansmen responsible for the bombing at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, which killed four black girls.\n\nSome citizens regarded a public rejection of Moore as being on the right side of history, a position they sought to prove personally by placing Doug Jones signs in their yards.\n\nJones\u2019 campaign manager, Doug Turner, said his office had trouble keeping up with the demand for yard signs. He received reports that signs were being stolen from yards, not by the opposition, but by other Jones supporters eager to display them in their own yards.\n\nThis fervor was reflected in the vote totals, as Jones became the first Alabama Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate in 25 years. Jones carried the precincts in District 46 by about 15 points.\n\nSTEWART'S HOMECOMING\n\nThree years ago, Felicia Stewart moved back to her home state of Alabama with her wife of 16 years, Christy, and their 7-year-old twin daughters, Harper and Helen. Stewart, who holds an MBA and worked in the corporate world for many years, was intent on making positive change in the state, and believed nonprofit work would be the best avenue. Entering politics hadn\u2019t crossed her mind, but she was interested in certain issues such as education, poverty and health care, so she went to the state's capital, Montgomery, to observe how the political process affected them.\n\nFelicia Stewart with her wife, Christy (right), and her twin daughters Harper and Helen. Courtesy of Felicia Stewart\n\nBecause the Republican leaders of all three branches of state government were in varying degrees of trouble \u2014 Governor Robert Bentley was beginning to deal with a sex scandal that would ultimately lead to his resignation, House Speaker Mike Hubbard was facing jail for ethics violations, and Roy Moore was set to be removed from the bench for the second time \u2014 Stewart did not set high expectations for the state government.\n\nEven so, what she found disturbed her deeply. She claimed that several elected officials were absent from key information sessions and votes on important legislation. And she said many of the legislators who were present didn\u2019t seem well-informed or even inclined to be.\n\n\u201cI was just incensed by what was and was not happening in Montgomery, and how those activities were perpetuating all the things that are wrong here \u2014 and doing precious little to grow the things that are right,\u201d she said.\n\nStewart said she felt she could do better for her state and began discussing the possibility of running for office.\n\nShe launched her campaign at the same time as Doug Jones, and she was quickly swept up in the enthusiasm by citizens to support Democratic candidates publicly. Her supporters were energized and demanded she get them signs for their yards as soon as possible.\n\nFile photo: Supporters listen to Doug Jones speak at a rally at Old Car Heaven in Birmingham, Alabama on Dec. 11, 2017. Marvin Gentry / Reuters\n\nStewart, who had no opponent in the primary, said even though she was advised not to spend money on signs before the primaries, her campaign got them out in March.\n\n\u201cWe knew that it would take more time to make necessary connections and to build a viable brand,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re a good candidate, in some of these tight-knit communities, if they don\u2019t know you, regardless of your qualifications, you\u2019re not an option.\"\n\nIn the last two months, Stewart\u2019s campaign has held events nearly every day. Between meet and greets, canvassing, phone banking, postcard writing and yard sign placement, her volunteers have succeeded in elevating the profile of a candidacy that would have been unimaginable only a few years ago.\n\nWhile Stewart has told local news outlets that's she's \"proud\" of who she is, she has stressed that she's \"not running as a 'gay candidate'\" or even a \"female candidate\" but as a \"native Alabamian who expects more for her state.\" And while her sexuality has not been an issue in her quest to represent the 46th District, a 2017 Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) poll revealed Alabama to be the only state in the U.S. where a majority of residents opposed same-sex marriage. If she pulls off an election victory on Nov. 6, she will be just the second or third openly LGBTQ lawmaker in the state, behind state Rep. Patricia Todd (openly gay former Marine Neil Rafferty is running for the seat Todd is leaving).\n\nSigns decorate a home hosting a meet and greet for Felicia Stewart. Fergus Tuohy\n\nOne of Stewart\u2019s more ardent supporters is Laura Williams, a 57-year-old Homewood resident and the former campaign press secretary to longtime Alabama Senator Richard Shelby, who in 1994 switched to the Republican party after initially serving in the Senate as a Democrat. Williams hosted a meet and greet for Stewart in May. She said she assumed 90 percent of her neighbors were Republicans and was determined to have them meet the Democratic hopeful.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I met her, I honestly believed if you meet Felicia, and you talk with Felicia, you walk away voting for Felicia,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou walk away thinking, \u2018How could I not vote for her?\u2019\u201d\n\nOne of the neighbors in attendance was 73-year-old Kyle DeLoach, a retired auditor who considers himself a conservative. DeLoach said he was impressed by Stewart\u2019s engagement with the community and her handling of voters' questions.\n\n\u201cIt was nice meeting a candidate face to face for a change,\u201d he said. \u201cFelicia has gone out and made herself known and is willing to do the hard work.\"\n\n\"She\u2019s voiced her concerns with the state of Alabama and its political problems, of which we have many,\" he added. \"I definitely plan on voting for her.\"\n\nCROSSING THE AISLE\n\nWhile last year's special election may have served as the catalyst that allowed candidates like Stewart to make inroads in this deep-red state, Roy Moore is not on the ballot this time around. However, Democrats hope that voters will remain energized against the party that backed him.\n\nIf their energy is indeed sustainable, another candidate who may benefit is Judge Bob Vance, a Democrat running for Roy Moore's old job as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Vance nearly defeated Moore in the 2012 contest for that seat and has received bipartisan support this time around, which includes endorsements from Republican judges.\n\nNatalie Davis, professor emerita of political science at Birmingham Southern College, said last year's special election \"may have loosened some votes that otherwise would go Republican.\" However, she cautioned Democrats to temper their enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t have a sense that people all of a sudden in Mountain Brook are going to vote Democratic because they voted for Doug Jones,\" she said. \"But, on the other hand, appeals to women \u2014 to educated women, to young women \u2014 may very well help [Stewart].\u201d\n\nOne of those educated, young women is Annie Damsky, a 38-year-old Mountain Brook resident who hosted an event at her yoga studio earlier this year for Stewart and two other women running to unseat incumbent Republicans in adjacent districts.\n\n\u201cA lot of women crossed the aisle in the special election,\u201d Damsky told NBC News. \u201cAnd they probably aren\u2019t going back.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Cameron M.

While NRA membership overwhelmingly favors some reasonable reforms in federal and state laws relating to gun ownership, safety and availability, NRA leadership adamantly oppose any legislation that impacts the on-demand availability of deadly weapons of all kinds, which would slow down sales and bring down revenues for their constituent gun manufacturers.\n\nThe NRA has done a masterful job of conflating national pride, religious fervor and the concept of \u201cfreedom\u201d with gun ownership.

Wayne LaPierre, who makes a seven-figure salary, took a hefty $5,000,000 (including some deferred retirement funds) out of the NRA in 2016, yet he calls opponents of unfettered gun access varying versions of \u201cacademic elites, political elites, and media elites\u201d or elites of Hollywood and television, all of which are intended to evoke the perception that Jewish people \u201ccontrol\u201d academia, politics, the media and Hollywood.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s completely understandable that they use racist dog-whistles, lie to their membership and hustle in any and every way to keep their members actively donating and blindly voting for the NRA\u2019s preferred politicians so the NRA can afford its high-ticket nut \u2014 the massive salaries it pays its many executives.\n\nBut the NRA activity which most mocks and undermines our democracy is its payoffs to politicians in the form of direct campaign contributions, campaign \u201cassistance\u201d funneled through political action committees and other shady but arguably \u201clegal\u201d methods for \u201cinfluencing\u201d political action and inaction \u2014 which are no better than legal bribes.\n\nAnd, perhaps even worse, investigations are reportedly underway to determine whether the NRA used Russian money to support its efforts to elect President Trump. If true, that would be the worst and most unpatriotic advocacy imaginable.\n\nRegardless, 99 percent of politicians receiving NRA financial aid in 2016 were Republicans., and Republicans have blocked every effort to institute reasonable gun policy in this country. The CDC was legislatively prohibited from studying the effects of gun activity on our American populace from 1996 until this year. Would you believe that the ATF is legislatively prohibited from digitizing the gun-related paperwork dealers are required to submit, so that it cannot be easily searched? This is just some of the work of the NRA and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Republican Party.\n\nWhen you hear the Paul Ryans, Marco Rubios and Ted Cruzes sending thoughts and prayers, and saying it\u2019s \u201ctoo soon\u201d to talk about guns after a mass shooting, you\u2019re probably hearing the words which were cooked-up in the NRA\u2019s Virginia headquarters, laboratory tested and distributed to elected officials.\n\nPollsters have a way of delivering results that jibe with the worldview of the entity who commissioned any given poll but, that said, polls and surveys indicate time and time again that the majority of Americans \u2014 and sometimes the vast majority \u2014 are in favor of stricter gun laws, such as those requiring criminal background checks, some type of basic mental health review, a reasonable waiting period or some type of reasonable age restriction. Nonetheless, time and time again, any effort to promote legislation consistent with the will of the people gets the kibosh from \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the NRA.\n\nTake our home state of Florida, where an elected official whose county or municipality democratically passes any gun-related legislation (e.g. prohibiting firearms from a particular public park) is subject to removal from office by the governor and a personal fine of $5,000. Why? Because NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer said so. (Does that sound like democracy to you?)\n\nThe above examples merely scratch the surface of the NRA\u2019s influence in our political system: They regularly use strong-arm tactics to influence the behavior, talking points and voting of its bought-and-paid-for elected officials.\n\nThe solution is much less complicated than the problem: Vote them out. Vote against politicians that are funded by and supported by the NRA. No one is going to take away your Second Amendment rights; that\u2019s just crazy talk designed to stoke fear so that you vote for politicians who block the common sense reforms most of us want.\n\nWe didn\u2019t vote for Oliver North or Wayne LaPierre to represent us in Congress, so we must remove from office those who blindly do their bidding in exchange for cold, hard cash.\n\nAs has been clearly demonstrated time and time again, the lives of our loved ones depend on it.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 If there\u2019s been one constant over the last few days, it\u2019s how close all the polls have been, especially for the Senate and gubernatorial contests. It\u2019s tied in FL-SEN and FL-GOV, per CNN. It\u2019s a jump ball in GA-GOV (which is likely headed to a runoff). And our NBC/Marist polls of AZ-SEN and IN-SEN showed incredibly close races.\n\nSo how might these tight matchups break in the end? Our NBC/Marist polls of Arizona and Indiana looked at the \u201cpersuadable\u201d voters \u2014 that is, those who were either undecided or were leaning towards a particular candidate but said they might change their mind.\n\nOur Indiana poll \u2014 which had Dem Joe Donnelly leading Republican Mike Braun by 3 points \u2014 found 14 percent of likely voters being persuadable, and among these persuadable voters, Trump\u2019s approval rating is 42 percent-38 percent (versus 50 percent-42 percent among all likely voters). Donnelly\u2019s fav/unfav is 27 percent/25 percent (+2), versus Braun\u2019s fav/unfav at 14 percent/35 percent (-21). And congressional preference is even among these voters (when it was R+7 among all likely voters).\n\nBottom line: These persuadable voters in Indiana seem like true swing voters, and they\u2019re more negative on Braun than on Donnelly.\n\nIn Arizona \u2014 where Dem Kyrsten Sinema was ahead of Republican Martha McSally by 3 points in a three-way contest \u2014 10 percent of the likely voters are persuadable, and Trump\u2019s job rating is 25 percent-49 percent; Sinema\u2019s fav/unfav is 26 percent/44 percent (-18); McSally\u2019s fav/unfav is 16 percent/41 percent (-25); and congressional preference is D+3.\n\nBottom line: These voters in Arizona are really down on President Trump, and they don\u2019t like Sinema or McSally (but they like McSally even less).\n\nAnd we\u2019ll be watching these undecided/persuadable voters in our final NBC/Marist polls that we\u2019ll be releasing on Monday\u2026\n\nWatching the independent voters with four days to go\n\nFor all of the attention on the fired-up base voters (Trump supporters vs. urban/suburban women), it\u2019s also important to keep an eye on the middle of the electorate.\n\nIn our Arizona poll, Sinema was winning independents by 26 points (58 percent to 32 percent); just 33 percent of independents approved of Trump\u2019s job performance; and indies preferred a Dem-controlled Congress by 14 points (50 percent to 36 percent).\n\nIn our Indiana poll, Donnelly was winning independents by 23 points (54 percent to 31 percent); just 39 percent of indies approved of Trump\u2019s job; and independents preferred a Dem-controlled Congress by 9 points (47 percent to 38 percent).\n\nAnd in our Tennessee poll, Dem Phil Bredesen was winning indies by 24 points (59 percent to 35 percent); just 42 percent of indies approved of Trump\u2019s job; and indies preferred a Dem-controlled by 5 points (46 percent to 41 percent).\n\nRemembering how VA-GOV last year played out in the final days\n\nAnd with President Trump closing on a message of fear and immigration in these waning days, here\u2019s a reminder: This is exactly the same message that Ed Gillespie and the GOP used at the end of the 2017 gubernatorial race in Virginia.\n\nYesterday\u2019s split-screen day: Trump versus Oprah\n\nHere was President Trump talking about immigration: \u201cAt this very moment large well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. It's like an invasion. They have violently overrun the Mexican border.\u201d\n\nMore Trump: \u201cOnce they arrive, the Democrat Party's vision is to offer them free healthcare, free welfare, free education and even the right to vote. You and the hard working members of our country will be asked to pick up the entire tab.\u201d\n\nAnd this from Trump: \u201cI will tell you this. Anybody throwing stones, rocks, like they did to Mexico and the Mexican military and Mexican police, where they badly hurt police and soldiers of Mexico, we will consider that a firearm because there's not much difference.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, here was Oprah Winfrey campaigning for Democrat Stacey Abrams in Georgia, per NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker: \"I am not here because I am making some grand stand, because I'm thinking of running myself. I don't want to run. I am not trying to test any waters. Won\u2019t want to go into those waters.\"\n\nMore Winfrey: \"I'm here today because of the men and women who were lynched, discriminated, suppressed at the polls ...

Federal Bureau of Prisons\n\nThe prison announced Thursday that it has suspended inmate visitations until further notice. No other details were made available.\n\nBulger, who ran Boston\u2019s Irish mob while feeding tips to the FBI to weaken his rivals, arrived at the West Virginia prison the night before he was killed.\n\nHe was shipped north after receiving multiple infractions at the Coleman penitentiary in Florida.\n\nBulger was cited for masturbating in front of a male staffer in 2015 and threatening a nursing supervisor in February of this year, according to prison records.\n\n\u201cYour day of reckoning is coming,\u201d he told the worker, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nBulger was placed in solitary confinement and remained there until Oct. 23, when he was shipped to a transfer facility in Oklahoma.\n\nThe geriatric mobster arrived at Hazelton at 6:45 p.m. Monday night, according to prison records.\n\nA prison staffer told NBC News Bulger was seen rolling off a correctional bus in his wheelchair. Records show that he was placed in his cell at 9:53 p.m. The housing facility was already locked down at that time, according to a prison staffer.\n\nBut when a new inmate arrives at a housing area, the other inmates typically take notice, the staffer said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you see in the movies,\u201d the worker said.\n\nBulger agreed to be placed with the general population, according to law enforcement sources.\n\nBut the once-feared mob boss and FBI informant didn\u2019t last long there.\n\nThe overnight lockdown is lifted after the 5 a.m. prisoner count. Inmates are then let out of their cells to head to the dining hall, providing a window of opportunity for a prisoner seeking to attack a fellow inmate.\n\nBulger was found unresponsive in his cell after he didn\u2019t show up for breakfast, according to law enforcement sources.\n\nFederal investigators are looking into Bulger\u2019s medical classification when he was transferred to West Virginia, the law enforcement sources said. There are four Bureau of Prison medical care levels, with the higher figure representing a more dire health condition.\n\nDocuments obtained by NBC News show Bulger, who had been struggling with heart problems, was classified as a level two in West Virginia, a lower level than when he was in other medical facilities in the federal prison system. The documents also show a code indicating his medical treatment had been completed, allowing for referral to general population.\n\nPrison workers told NBC News that it was not unusual for an elderly or ailing inmate to be transferred to Hazelton due to its proximity to the J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital in nearby Morgantown.\n\nBut some prison staffers and union officials said they were surprised that Bulger wound up in the regular housing unit instead of an area where high-profile inmates are separated from the general population.\n\nHazelton prison is known as one of the most violent penitentiaries in the country, said Rick Heldreth, president of the AFGE local 420 prison workers union.\n\n\u201cI thought it was unusual that this specific inmate was placed in general population in our facility given the level of violence and the type of inmates housed there,\u201d Heldreth told NBC News.\n\n\u201cThat decision would have been far above us.\u201d\n\nHeldreth said Bulger\u2019s reputation as a mob turncoat would have made him particularly vulnerable to an attack.\n\n\u201cIn general population, you\u2019re in a housing unit with 120 inmates and they have full access to you,\u201d Heldreth said. \u201cI know how he\u2019s been labeled in the court system and that\u2019s not something that goes over well with our inmate population.\u201d\n\nThe prison has been suffering from a staff shortage set in motion in 2017 when the Trump administration ordered a federal hiring freeze, prison union officials said.\n\nSince then, staffers who left the facility through retirement or other reasons have not been replaced, leading a once-880 person staff to drop to 797 workers, according to the union.\n\nThe drop has forced the prison to occasionally shift prison plumbers, teachers and other staffers into officer roles to fill gaps, Heldreth said.\n\nMoney has been appropriated to fill more than 40 open correctional officer positions but no hires have been made, union officials said.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons said it's working to fill a total of 36 vacant correctional officer positions.\n\n\"Regarding the recent incidence of violence at FCC Hazelton, the BOP has sent a team of subject-matter experts to the complex to assess operational activities and correctional security practices and measures to determine any relevant facts that may have contributed to the incident,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The team will make recommendations to the BOP\u2019s senior leadership to assist in mitigating any identified risks.\"\n\nJust four days before Bulger\u2019s killing, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressing concern over the \u201cfailure to follow clear congressional directives to hire more full-time correctional officers\u201d at Hazelton and other facilities.\n\n\u201cLast month, another inmate was killed at the same West Virginia facility, marking the second homicide in that facility in just five months,\u201d Manchin wrote, referring to Hazelton. \u201cThis is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nJames \"Whitey\" Bulger walks around Castle Island in South Boston in 1994.

Prisons are inherently dangerous places,\u201d Heldreth said. \u201cBut the more staff you have, the better the chances of finding a weapon or stopping a fight or assault before it turns deadly.\u201d\n\nAnother union official, Justin Tarovisky, said the drop in correctional officers has compromised the safety of the workers and the inmates.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Astronomers in Hungary say they\u2019ve detected a pair of what some call \u201cghost moons\u201d orbiting our planet not far from the moon we all know.\n\nThe hazy clouds of dust \u2014 tens of thousands of miles across but too faint to be seen with the naked eye \u2014 were first detected almost 60 years ago by a Polish astronomer, Kazimierz Kordylewski. But the patches of light he found were too indistinct to convince some scientists that the clouds were really there, and the existence of the \"Kordylewski clouds\" has long been a matter of controversy.\n\nNow the astronomers, Gabor Horvath and Judit Sliz-Balogh of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest, have obtained clear evidence of the clouds using a specially equipped telescope in a private observatory in western Hungary.\n\nIn the new images, published Oct. 2 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the so-called Kordylewski clouds appear as indistinct patches of light against the darkness of space \u2014 though they show up clearly in an artist's rendering that greatly exaggerates their brightness.\n\nThey may not look like moons, but these dust clouds (pictured here at Lagrange point L5) orbit Earth at roughly the same distance. J. Sliz-Balogh / Royal Astronomical Society\n\n\u201cThink of them like the cloud of dust you get when a car drives down a dirt road,\u201d astronomer Phillip Plait, who writes the popular Bad Astronomy blog, told NBC News MACH in an email. \u201cSo they're not really 'moons' in the usual sense.\u201d\n\nThe Kordylewski clouds orbit Earth at roughly the same distance as the moon \u2014 about 250,000 miles away. One cloud orbits ahead of the moon and the other behind in specific regions of the sky where Earth's gravitational pull is canceled out by the moon's. Known as Lagrange points, these regions act as \u201cgravitational vacuum-cleaners,\u201d collecting dust and gas that can persist for decades, Horvath said in an email.\n\n\u201cThe idea here is that when you have a biggish object, like the Earth, orbited by a smaller one, like the moon, there are regions of space where the centrifugal force balances gravity,\u201d Plait said. \u201cPut a much smaller object there, and it'll stay there for a long time.\u201d\n\nJust how long remains uncertain. Though the clouds seem to have been in existence at least since 1961, when Kordylewski first detected them, some researchers say these dusty clouds could dissipate in coming years.

By sending messages as data over the internet, users could get around per-text message charges, making it a cheap, efficient and easy way to communicate. To sign up, all a user needed was a cellphone number.\n\nThe app now has more than 1.5 billion monthly users worldwide, making it the most popular messaging service in the world. The app is particularly favored in India, Brazil, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. And in some developing countries where mobile phones are the primary way people connect to the internet, WhatsApp accounts for a significant portion of overall internet use.\n\n\"There are vast differences in social media use in developing countries,\" Nahema Marchal, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, wrote in an email.\n\nMarchal said that group chats on WhatsApp are particularly prevalent and can serve as small versions of town squares, where fake news can easily be shared.\n\n\"The group chat function, in particular, is very popular to share media and messages with multiple people at a time,\u201d Marchal said. \u201cIn large public groups, limited to 256 members, users share both political and mundane content at very high speeds, which can facilitate the spread of misleading or polarizing information.\u201d\n\nThe use of groups also allows for certain dynamics to emerge. For instance, if some members of a group question its agenda or policies, they can be deleted by group leaders, shaping behavior and creating new norms.\n\n\u201cYou can have, for example, a family group, a friend group, a church group, a work group, a group for the causes you're active in,\u201d said Priscila Neri, a program manager with Witness, a nonprofit that trains citizens to record human rights issues through videos and smartphones.\n\n\u201cIt's really easy for you to forward something to many groups and reach thousands of people at once, and then those folks forward on to their many groups and so on and so forth,\u201d Neri said.\n\nScreenshot of a third-party app for finding WhatsApp groups to join without being invited.

For instance, the decade high for communal violence in India was 943 incidents in 2008 -- two years before WhatsApp was introduced in the country, according to Indian Ministry of Home data.\n\nHowever, after WhatsApp was introduced, a downward trend in communal violence started to reverse. Since 2010, violent incidents in India have risen 40 percent, going from 580 in 2011 to 822 in 2017, according to the ministry\u2019s data.\n\nIn some ways, WhatsApp and other messaging services are just a deadly game of \u201ctelephone,\u201d with information getting twisted at each hop along the way. But in several instances, investigators have found there are core groups of people dedicated to spreading falsehoods.\n\nIn India, after 60 villagers beat two men suspected of attempting to murder people and sell their organs, police joined several local groups to find three men responsible for circulating the messages and arrested them, Reuters reported.\n\nIndia also recently called for WhatsApp to hand over the locations and identities of people who used the app to spread misinformation that led to violence.\n\nWhatsApp has also been blamed for not doing enough to stop the spread of politically charged misinformation in Brazil, where activists and marketers figured out how to blast messages to hundreds of users and automatically add users to new groups without their consent by scraping users' phone numbers from sites including Facebook, a BBC investigation found.\n\nBefore Brazil\u2019s recent presidential election, won by Jair Bolsonaro, a hard-line populist, his supporters used organized WhatsApp groups to direct online attacks against people who posted online in support of the opposition.\n\nIn response to these concerns, WhatsApp has been taking action, adding barriers to \"spammy\" and abnormal behaviors, Carl Woog, a WhatsApp spokesperson, said in an email.\n\n\"For example, during the Brazil election we have proactively banned hundreds of thousands of accounts for spam,\" wrote Woog.\n\nThe service has started testing limitations on features such as the ability to forward messages to an entire contact list, he said. It also added a \"forward label\" to inform users whether a forwarded message wasn't created by the sender, and tweaked features of group conversations to limit who can send messages in groups.\n\nBut WhatsApp is limited in what it can police by some of its own features, particularly the encryption that is valued by privacy advocates. Because the messages are encrypted, not even WhatsApp employees are necessarily able to trace and shut down misinformation.\n\nIn some countries, fact-checking organizations have resorted to sending corrections on reported misinformation back to the users who flagged the reports and begging them to share those messages with the groups where they were initially found.\n\n\"The difficulty with these messaging services is that they are closed groups on encrypted services, so the disinformation tends to travel quickly and is both difficult to thwart and debunk,\" Donovan, of the Data & Society Research Institute, said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Cox decided to move the site to a new county Expo Center after learning that a construction project was planned for late October at the civic center \u2014 though work had not started as of Thursday.\n\nThe ACLU asked Crabtree to order Cox to open both the old and new polling sites for Tuesday for Election Day. The ACLU argues that moving the only polling site makes it more difficult for the city's mostly Hispanic population to vote.\n\nCrabtree said the court has not decided whether they will ultimately succeed on their constitutional claims, and said that the court has concluded that they have not shown that they are likely to prevail on their lawsuit.\n\nThe hearing ended with Crabtree questioning Cox and her attorneys about arrangements for voters who show up at the old polling site. They said the city has offered to take voters from their homes and jobs to the new polling place, and Cox said she reached out to the city again Thursday morning about moving voters between the old and new polling sites.\n\n\"They do have a limited number of buses, however,\" she said.\n\nCox's conflict with the ACLU over the single polling site stretches back to at least May, when Johnny Dunlap, the Ford County Democratic Party chairman and a volunteer for an ACLU voting rights project, asked her to open a second polling site for Dodge City, according to testimony. Both he and Cox testified that Dunlap and her office had further run-ins during the August primary, and in October, the ACLU asked Cox to publicize a hotline for its voting rights project on her office's website.\n\nShe forwarded that request to the Kansas secretary of state's office in an Oct. 22 email saying, \"LOL.\"\n\n\"What I really meant is, 'Here we go again. Where is it going to stop?'\" Cox testified.\n\nCrabtree wrote in his ruling he was troubled by Cox's reaction to the letter and questioned \"whether it manifests a disregard for the 'fundamental significance' that our Constitution places on the right to vote.\"\n\nThe southwest Kansas city, located 160 miles (257 kilometers) west of Wichita, once was a destination for cattle drives where cowboys and gunslingers tangled. In recent decades, meatpacking plants have drawn to the town thousands of Hispanics, who now make up a majority of the 27,000 population.\n\nCox is a Republican who has served as the elected county clerk since 2016. She sent a notice to voters on Sept. 28 that she was moving the location for the upcoming election outside the city limits to the new Expo Center, which she acknowledged in the mailing was inconvenient.\n\nThe ACLU sued on behalf of the League of United Latin American Citizens and Alejandro Rangel-Lopez, the 18-year-old son of Mexican immigrants who will be voting for the first time in November.\n\nRangel-Lopez testified by phone that his father, who became a U.S. citizen in 2004, has had to wait an hour and sometimes two hours to vote at the single polling place.\n\nAs for the new polling site, he said, \"It's just in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nDunlap said that in his opinion, the city's bus system \"does not have the capacity\" to move potentially several thousand voters.\n\nCox and Bryan Caskey, the state elections director in the Kansas secretary of state's office, questioned whether Ford County would have enough time to find and program equipment, find and train election workers and make other arrangements for a second polling site. Caskey noted Kansas law requires election officials to assign each voter to only one polling place on Election Day, a further complication.\n\n\"I don't like to use the word impossible because I don't work in impossibilities.

Claire McCaskill is so tight that neither has led by more than four points in a publicly released poll this year.\n\nWhile Trump trashed McCaskill \u2014 calling her a \"far left Democrat\" \u2014 and praised Hawley as \"a star,\" his focus remained on the caravans of migrants making their way from Central America toward the U.S.\n\n\"These are tough people,\" Trump said. \"These are not angels. These are not little angels. And we are not letting them into our country.\"\n\nHe reminded his supporters that he is sending up to 15,000 troops to the U.S. border, a policy that he had discussed at the White House earlier in the day, and that he intends to sign an executive order designed to deny birthright citizenship to the children of undocumented immigrants born in the U.S.\n\nOn Thursday night, Trump called the guarantee of citizenship to babies born inside U.S. borders a \u201ccrazy, lunatic policy.\u201d\n\nMany legal scholars believe the 14th Amendment, which stipulates that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,\" guarantees citizen status to those born inside American borders. Those who agree with Trump argue those children are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the federal government.\n\nHawley, who walked down the steps of Air Force One with Trump, was invited to the podium to make his case to the voters. He rapped McCaskill and lauded Trump, claiming that his victory of nearly 20 percentage points was the biggest ever. In just the last 50 years, presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson won Missouri by greater margins than Trump.\n\nBryan Mosher, 41, a computer technician and Marine Corps veteran, said he agrees with Trump's policies on immigration, from birthright citizenship to reinforcing the border with U.S. troops. And, he said, he's fine with Trump's formulation that American forces should treat any migrants who throw rocks as if they are firing guns.\n\n\"I think that you can't put somebody in harm's way and then handcuff them, tell them they can't defend themselves,\" Mosher said, though he clarified he believes Trump is sending troops as a deterrent rather than in anticipation that they will fire weapons.\n\nKathleen Pfaff, 66, of Chillicothe, said she believes troops should be allowed to fire their weapons without \"shooting to kill.\" Along with the economy and abortion, she said, securing the border is one of the most important issues to her.\n\n\"You can't just let everybody in without checking them out,\" she said. \"How many people did it take with the Twin Towers?

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, but, in the wake of the recent pipe bombs mailings and a massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue last Saturday, he was more restrained. Trump referred to the perpetrators of both acts to say that the events paused a Republican run.\n\n\u201cTwo maniacs stopped the momentum. But we don\u2019t care about momentum when it comes to safety.

In New York\u2019s 14th, Joe Crowley, one of the most powerful Democrats in the country and state of New York, was unseated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Then, in Massachusetts 7th, Ayanna Pressley beat 10-term incumbent Mike Capuano.\n\nDown-ballot progressives unseated even more centrists. In New York, seven state senators lost primaries, including the most powerful Democrat in the state senate. These two victories launched a thousand takes about the fate of liberalism. Were Democrats drifting to the left? Were Democratic Socialists taking over? But what has not broadly been understood is that this is only the beginning of young people remaking a new Democratic Party.\n\nIndeed, despite the increasingly popular narrative that millennials are apathetic, or unlikely to vote in these midterms, they are having an impact.\n\nThese two victories launched a thousand takes about the fate of liberalism. Were Democrats drifting to the left? Were Democratic Socialists taking over?\n\nData for Progress is a progressive think tank founded by myself, Colin McAuliffe and Jon Green. We analyzed the New York state voter file and found that young voters were overwhelmingly backing primary challengers in NY-09, NY-12 and NY-14 (where they were enough to put Ocasio-Cortez over the top.) Our analysis of Florida\u2019s gubernatorial Democratic primary suggest the same pattern, with young voters and black voters (and young black voters) putting Andrew Gillum over the top in a tight race. Young people are challenging the party on racial justice, with the Black Lives Matter and pro-immigration Dreamer movements questioning the assumption that the humanity of the Democratic base should be sacrificed for electoral gain.\n\nAnd an increasing body of polling research suggests there is very little limit to how far left young progressives are willing to go. Data for Progress has been polling a broad range of issues in partnership with YouGov Blue and Civis Analytics as part of our efforts to understand how progressive issues could reshape the electoral system. One of our most consistent findings is that young people are incredibly supportive of left policies, even those that are far outside of the mainstream. We found, for example, that individuals under 45 have net positive support (support minus opposition) for a 90 percent marginal tax on income over a million dollars, reparations for slavery, a universal basic income, universal basic wealth and abolishing ICE.\n\nAs part of our New Progressive Agenda Project with Civis Analytics, we found positive support nationally for employer governance, family leave, tuition free college, public housing and statehood for Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Among individuals aged 18-34, net support (support minus opposition) for all the policies was at least 22 percent. For individuals over 65, free college and housing both have net opposition.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that young people are supportive of a more left agenda. Why this might be true is also not a mystery. After coming of age in a brutal recession, many young people yearn for a better standard of living. Research suggests that experiencing a recession at a young ages permanently shapes your political attitudes and that these attitudes are sticky, meaning the recession could create a long-term progressive millennial generation.\n\nThe only problem is that for too long, it's true that there has been persistently low turnout among young voters. In the 2014 midterms, less than 20 percent of individuals between the ages of 18 and 29 voted. In 2016, about 46 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds voted, compared with over 70 percent of those 65 or older. There is even some evidence that millennials vote at a lower rate than their parents did at the same age.\n\nSo how can we change this? Finding and supporting young progressive candidates wouldn\u2019t hurt. Voter file analysis suggests that turnout among young people drove Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s surprise victory in NY-14, evidence that compelling candidates running on popular policies could bolster turnout.\n\nThere is also a persistent myth that young people are consistently more liberal than older people and that people become more conservative with age. This is not true. Take for instance, the 1984 New York Times headline, \u201cYounger Voters Tending to Give Reagan Support.\u201d Or the 1988 Times headline, \u201cPolitical Memo; GOP Makes Reagan Lure Of Young a Long-Term Asset.\u201d One does not need to go back very far to find young and old voters providing President George W. Bush with similar levels of support. Indeed, if anything the oldest voters were somewhat more supportive of Al Gore).\n\nThe growing liberalism of young people, combined with a political system that does not reflect their preferences, increasingly stretches democracy. The median American is almost 38 years old. However, the median voter is substantially older. And here are a few other numbers to ponder: The average age of members of the House of Representatives is 58 and the average senator is 62.\n\nIn the past, this was not a threat to democracy, but when the attitudes and partisanship of Americans seems increasingly divided by age, this gap reflects more than a pop culture clash. We are witness a lack of democratic responsiveness that threatens our core values. With less than a week left until one of the more consequential midterms in the past decade or so, young people can help push America back on track \u2014 if they show up.\n\nTo learn more about Sean McElwee's thoughts on the future of the Democratic Party, listen to his conversation with Chris Hayes on this episode of \"Why Is This Happening?\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The meetings, members have said, were the first time most of the group ever had the chance to meet other young people who identified as both LGBTQ and Muslim.\n\nThe council, which is made up of people age 16 to 24, is part of the larger nonprofit Advocates for Youth, which works to ensure that all young people have access to accurate and age-appropriate information about sexuality and sexual health. They began wondering how they could help build that sense of community for other young Muslims.\n\n\u201cWe often had to say \u2014 whether it was in our Muslim communities or in our LGBTQ communities \u2014 we\u2019d have to say, \u2018I\u2019m Muslim, but I\u2019m not homophobic\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m Muslim, but I can still be queer,\u2019\u201d said Khan. \u201cSo it\u2019s always \u2018I\u2019m Muslim but, but, but\u2026\u2019 instead of being able to say \u2018I\u2019m Muslim and these things.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe council developed the guide by imaging things that would have been helpful to teens like them who are currently in high school. Arzu Haider\n\nThose conversations inspired the council to create the #MuslimAnd social media campaign last fall as a way for young Muslims to share their stories.\n\nWhile information about LGBTQ Muslims is scarce, Pew Research found in 2017 that a majority of American Muslims now say that homosexuality should be accepted by society\n\nKhan and a colleague began developing the guide by interviewing fellow council members about their teenage experiences and asked them to look back and suggest things they felt would have been helpful to teens like them who are currently in high school.\n\n\u201cA lot of what we heard by asking was that they needed affirmation,\u201d she said. \u201cThey needed to know that other queer Muslims exist.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the new brochure features extensive quotes from LGBTQ Muslims in their teens and twenties. Topics covered include consent, finding the vocabulary to describe yourself and community resources.\n\n\u201cOften what we hear from young Muslims: First off, LGBTQ Muslims are thought to not exist,\u201d Khan said, adding that those messages often come from Muslim family members. Meanwhile, young Muslims also face Islamophobia or a misunderstanding of Islam and its tenants about sexuality from the larger LGBTQ community.\n\nNoor Pervez was one of the young Muslims who found the Council and a larger Muslim community through the #MuslimAnd campaign.\n\nTopics covered include consent, finding the vocabulary to describe yourself and community resources. Arzu Haider\n\n\u201cI was really enamoured with the idea that Muslim youth were coming together to combat media perceptions of this idea that Muslims can only be Muslims and that Muslims who are anything else are an anomaly,\u201d he said. \u201cI really latched on to that and used that hashtag pretty frequently.\u201d\n\nPervez\u2019s connection to the #MuslimAnd campaign also inspired him to help with the brochure. Growing up in Texas, \u201cMuslim representation for youth in general and queer youth in particular were almost nonexistent,\u201d he recalled. He hopes that the brochure will lead other young Muslims to find much needed information.\n\n\u201cThe main conversation that I am looking for is for LGBT youth and allies and people who want to be supportive but don\u2019t know how can see that we are not an abstract concept,\u201d Pervez, who identifies as non-binary and queer, said. \u201cWe are in the community with them and alongside them.\u201d\n\nOne way allies and educators can best support the LGBTQ Muslim community is to develop an understanding that aspects of the mainstream LGBTQ experience may not be always be feasible. Khan and her colleagues found that coming out to one's parents and community members does not always work for many young Muslims, who often grow up in environments where discussions about sexuality and relationships outside of marriage are highly discouraged.\n\n\u201cIt can often further isolate young Muslims when they they think, \u2018Oh, since I could never possibly come out to my parents right now that means that I can\u2019t be queer,\u2019 and that further invalidates their identity,\u201d Khan said.\n\n\u201cWe want that section to affirm young people that really if you don\u2019t tell anyone or if you tell the whole world, you are still queer and you are allowed to be that way,\u201d she added, referring to a section of the brochure about coming out.\n\nThat's why the new brochure features extensive quotes from LGBTQ Muslims in their teens and twenties. Arzu Haider\n\nBut Khan and other activists add that the progress the community has made with regards to LGBTQ issues should be acknowledged. Fellow activist Ameera Khan, who is trans, noted that she has seen the conversation move forward extensively in just the last few years.\n\n\u201cOne thing is that really radically different from when I was growing up was the conversation about trans people and gay people,\u201d Ameera Khan, who is unrelated to Khadija said, adding that many of the adults in the Muslim community she grew up around in St. Louis did not know what terms like transgender meant. \u201cThat normalization of folks that who are different but are equally valid in Islam, that\u2019s really something that I think young Muslims need to take a hold of that and run with it.\u201d\n\nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr.", "Man jumps into water with humpback whale to make daring rescue copied!\n\nVeteran fisherman Sam Synstelien climbed onto the back of a humpback whale off California\u2019s Central Coast and used a small knife to free the creature from a fishing line.\n\nRead More", "The difficult toll Alzheimer's takes on family caregivers copied!\n\nExperts say of the 16 million family caregivers, nearly 60 percent suffer from high emotional stress, 40 percent suffer from depression, and 250,000 are under 18 years old.\n\nRead More", "FDA to decide fate of e-cigs as use surges among teens copied!\n\nThe FDA is calling rise of e-cigs an epidemic, with three million high school students this year using e-cigarettes, up more than 75% from last year.\n\nRead More", "Google employees walk out to raise awareness about workplace sexual harassment copied!\n\nEmployees walked out of their offices from Dublin to Zurich, New York to Silicon Valley in a coordinated protest to raise awareness about workplace sexual harassment.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

They won't.\"\n\nTrump has said he would send as many as 15,000 troops to stop the migrant caravan.\n\nHowever, the caravan would not present a drastic increase in border crossings, as Trump has projected. Internal estimates by DHS obtained by NBC News estimates the first and largest group of migrants in the caravan to be around 3,500. Already, according to the latest border apprehension numbers, an average of 1,600 migrants are stopped or apprehended at the border each day.\n\nStatement 2: Trump also vowed to block asylum seekers from claiming asylum if they are caught crossing the border outside of legal ports of entry.\n\nFact: This proposal, expected to be codified in an executive action next week, is likely to face legal challenges in federal court. Under current law, immigrants are allowed to make a claim for asylum anywhere in the U.S., no matter how they entered.\n\nAnd the Trump administration would be in violation of international asylum law as well, said Scott Anderson, a David M. Rubenstein fellow in governance studies at The Brookings Institution.\n\n\"U.S. treaty obligations require the United States to extend asylum to individuals who qualify as refugees if they are found in the United States or at any U.S. border, regardless of whether they arrived there legally or not,\" said Anderson. \"The same treaties also prohibit the United States from expelling qualified individuals or returning them to their country of origin absent certain extraordinary circumstances.\"\n\nAdministration officials told NBC News on Thursday that they believe Trump has the power to restrict asylum applicants to making claims only at border entry points because of a section of immigration law that allows the president \"to impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem appropriate.\" The Trump administration used the same language to defend Trump's executive order limiting travel from certain countries.\n\nStatement 3: Trump vowed to hold undocumented immigrants in detention until they could be deported. He said immigrants are now released from detention solely because the government does not have enough space to detain them. To fix this, Trump vowed to vastly expand detention space with so-called tent cities at the border.\n\nFact: There are reasons besides lack of space that stop U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from detaining migrants indefinitely. A 2001 Supreme Court decision in a case known as Zadvydas limited the amount of time ICE can hold adult immigrants in administrative detention to six months. And a federal court decision that was upheld in 2015, known as Flores, limits the amount of time children can remain in ICE detention to 20 days.\n\nStatement 4: When it separated families, said Trump, his administration was continuing an Obama-era policy of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border.\n\nFact: The Obama administration only separated children from their parents if the parent was going to be charged with a crime -- not including charges of crossing the border illegally. Last spring, under \"zero tolerance,\" the Trump administration changed this policy to begin charging, and therefore separating, parents whose only crime was crossing the border illegally. This significantly increased the number of separated parents and children from roughly 100 a month to more than 1,300 a month.\n\nStatement 5: There are 20 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.\n\nFact: Although it is impossible to know exactly how many there are, the Department of Homeland Security estimates this number to be closer to 12 million.\n\nStatement 6: Construction on the border wall is underway.\n\nFact: While there has been some fence building and repairing of existing structures, no concrete has been poured on a new border wall.\n\nStatement 7: Democrats want the immigrants in the caravan to have the right to vote, education and healthcare.\n\nFact: Only U.S. citizens have the right to vote, per the Constitution. While Democrats, more than Republicans, have supported a path to citizenship for immigrants already living in the U.S. illegally, they have not suggested that immigrants who have recently crossed the border without documents be given the right to vote. Undocumented immigrants are already allowed to enroll in public school. Healthcare.gov outlines which immigrants may be able to purchase health insurance, but recently arrived undocumented immigrants are not included.\n\nCORRECTION: (Nov. 2, 2018, 10:15 a.m. ET) An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a fellowship in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Brandy Zadrozny\n\nJacob Wohl, a pro-Trump fan of conspiracy theories, and Jack Burkman, a conservative lobbyist and radio host, stood in front of a half-full room of reporters and activists at a D.C.-area Holiday Inn Thursday to detail their allegations of sexual misconduct against Robert Mueller, the special counsel probing Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe woman who they said has made those allegations, a Los Angeles native in her 30s, was slated to attend the news conference and give her own account. But, Wohl said, she feared for her life and on arriving in Washington, \"panicked and boarded a flight to another location.\" Burkman promised she would appear at another news conference in the near future.\n\nWohl and Burkman took turns speaking at the podium, detailing the allegations, complimenting each other, and defending their professional records against charges of conspiracy peddling and political bias.\n\nThe conference was streamed by several reporters in the room. A pickup truck parked in the lot outside by one of the activists in attendance carried a giant inflatable rat wearing a blond Trump toupee.\n\nEarlier this week, several journalists reported on Twitter that they had received suspicious emails from a woman claiming someone had offered to pay her for making sexual misconduct allegations against Mueller. The journalists said those offers had come from SureFire Intelligence, a company NBC News connected to Jacob Wohl through telephone and domain records. Their claims were later bolstered by a second woman who came forward with an email offering similar payments in exchange for smearing Mueller, signed by a SureFire agent.\n\nBurkman opened the news conference by addressing the controversy.\n\n\"None of this is true,\" Burkman said of the allegations he and Wohl had been involved in a plot.\n\n\"There were no offers of payment, there was no wrongdoing, there was no bribery, there was nothing illegal or untoward or unethical that took place here,\" Wohl said.\n\nThe special counsel's office asked the FBI to investigate the matter last week, after learning of the alleged plot to smear Mueller. Burkman and Wohl said they had not been contacted by the FBI. \"I don't think the bureau would embarrass itself by calling us, talking about people that don't exist,\" Burkman said.\n\nWohl told reporters the woman making allegations had contacted Wohl with claims Mueller had sexually assaulted her in a New York City hotel room in August of 2010.\n\nExplaining that his \"default position\" is \"to not believe\" women who come forward with allegations of sexual assault, Wohl told reporters that he found the woman now accusing Mueller credible. Wohl said that he met her after she hired his company SureFire Intelligence to handle \"an estate matter.\" She later came back to him with the allegations.\n\nJack Burkman, a lawyer and Republican operative, is followed by the media after a news conference called to address his allegations against Special Counsel Robert Mueller in Arlington, Virginia, on Nov. 1, 2018. Joshua Roberts / Reuters\n\nLittle is known about the woman allegedly making these allegations. After Wohl and Burkman went back and forth on the exact spelling of her name, Wohl described her as a fashion designer, who was \"well-educated and comes from a good family.\"\n\n\"She is a gal who has an illustrious background and she is not politically oriented,\" Wohl said.\n\n\"We went through every meticulous detail of her allegation, we cross-referenced it with public records, we joined historical societies to get some of those records,\" he said. Wohl said they were \"in the process\" of going to police with the woman's allegations and would file a report by the end of next week.\n\nBurkman then stepped in and said the decision would be \"up to my client,\" and the evidence-gathering process was mid-investigation. \"We have tentacles out in all directions gathering evidence,\" Burkman said.\n\nThey further claimed to have more victims whose stories they were currently vetting. \"Hundreds of people have contacted us\" this week, Wohl said.\n\nBurkman is well-known for peddling baseless conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Democratic aide Seth Rich and promoting bombshell information that never materializes. Last November \u2014 again at a Holiday Inn \u2014 Burkman sent reporters home without making good on what he had advertised as new allegations of sexual harassment against a member of Congress.\n\nLikewise, Wohl, a former hedge fund manager now banned from the financial industry, has amplified prominent conspiracy theories as a writer for The Gateway Pundit, an often-inaccurate right-wing website.\n\nWhen Wohl and Burkman opened the floor to questions, the assembled reporters were unrestrained.\n\nWohl was asked about his political bias, specifically for his tweets attacking Mueller, including one where he wrote the special counsel should be sent to Guantanamo Bay. Wohl said his personal opinion had no effect on his professional handling of the investigation.\n\nOther reporters questioned 20-year-old Wohl's experience in the intelligence gathering business and why he had lied to reporters days earlier when he denied having any part in the investigation. Burkman responded, calling Wohl \"a child prodigy who has eclipsed Mozart.\"\n\nAt one point, Will Sommer from The Daily Beast said, \"No one is discounting [the woman's] account. We didn't know her name until 20 minutes ago. We're questioning both you two very un-credible people.\"\n\nNBC News has elected not to publish the woman's name because she has not gone public, and because of concerns about Wohl and Burkman's credibility.\n\nWhen questioned about a Washington Post account of Mueller at jury duty in D.C. on the date of the alleged incident in New York, Wohl accused the paper of reporting the story to discredit the woman.\n\nWhen reporters laughed at Wohl's suggestion that \"sometimes people go to jury duty, but they're also somewhere else,\" Wohl admonished the audience. \"It's not funny. It's not a laughing matter,\" he said.\n\nAs the hour they had booked was almost up, Burkman announced he would take one more question. Someone from the back shouted, \"Are you both prepared for federal prison?\"\n\n\"No we are not,\" Burkman answered.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Their new model, he said, was to have content that people couldn't get anywhere else.\n\nHastings was the lead independent director of Microsoft until 2012, when he stepped down.\n\n\"I know the guy who runs Netflix well, he was my boss,\" Ballmer said.\n\nBut sports leagues may not need Netflix.

During his time at the State Department under George Bush, Bolton added Cuba to the countries that comprised the \u201cbeyond axis of evil.\u201d\n\nBolton said the administration \u201cwill no longer appease dictators and despots near our shores in this hemisphere.\u201d He referred to Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega, and Cuba\u2019s Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, as the \u201cthree stooges\u201d of socialism and called them Larry, Curly, and Moe.\n\nHe announced President Donald Trump signed a new executive order that will prohibit U.S. citizens from involvement in the gold export trade from Venezuela.\n\nThe U.S. government has already sanctioned dozens of top Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, in an attempt to pressure the South American country to return to democracy. Venezuela has been plagued with food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime, driving almost 2 million Venezuelans out of their country since 2015.\n\nAlthough Bolton did not announce any sweeping measures, his stern words are widely seen as an attempt to mobilize conservative Latino voters in Florida, where elections are typically won by thin margins. The state has a number of tight congressional races, as well as a hotly contested senate and gubernatorial race.\n\nBolton blamed Cuba for enabling Maduro\u2019s government and he urged leaders of the region to \u201clet the Cuban regime know that it will be held responsible for continued oppression in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nHe announced the State Department added over two-dozen entities owned or controlled by the Cuban military and intelligence services to a restricted list prohibited to Americans. It\u2019s part of the Trump administration\u2019s roll back of former President Barack Obama\u2019s policy of d\u00e9tente.\n\nDuring the speech, Bolton sent a strong message to Ortega of Nicaragua, where 300 people have been killed in recent months during protests calling for the leader\u2019s ouster.\n\n\u201cFree, fair, and early elections must be held in Nicaragua, and democracy must be restored to the Nicaraguan people,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil then, the Nicaraguan regime, like Venezuela and Cuba, will feel the full weight of America\u2019s robust sanctions regime.\u201d\n\nBolton also praised Brazil\u2019s recently elected far-right, nationalist president Jair Bolsonaro, calling him a \u201clike-minded\u201d partner. He said Bolsonaro, who has often been dubbed the \"Tropical Trump\" but who has drawn controversy over homophobic and racist comments, could be a partner in fighting against leftist leaders.\n\nWith the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly aggressive stance on immigration, Bolton, ironically, spoke from Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, known as the \u201cEllis Island of the South.\u201d It was once a reception center for thousands of Cuban refugees in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThe largest communities of Cuban, Venezuelan, and Nicaraguan exiles are in South Florida. The situation back home is a key issue for some of them when voting.\n\nMany have advocated for stronger positions against the leaders of their counties, and Bolton's message could be well received just five days before the mid-term elections.\n\n\u201cI am certain that most refugees from Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua welcomed the comments by Bolton,\u201d said Al Cardenas, former Chairman of the Florida Republican Party and former head of the American Conservative Union.\n\n\u201cIt was not the first time, nor will it be the last, that U.S. senior officials make similar remarks just prior to an election,\u201d he said.\n\nMaintaining a tough stance against these countries is not just a Republican issue, though.\n\nDemocratic congressional candidates in South Florida, like Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala, have taken a hard position on Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, as they told NBC News in recent interviews.\n\nThe Cuban-American electorate has diversified ideologically in the last few years, but Cuban-Americans are still strong GOP supporters, according to a recent Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy survey conducted for Telemundo.\n\nHistorically, Nicaraguans in South Florida have identified with the Republican Party since the 1980s when the Ronald Reagan administration supported the Contras against the Sandinistas, according to Florida International University professor Eduardo Gamarra.\n\nVenezuelans are more complex, but they have warmed up to Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Vice President Mike Pence and their hard line against Maduro.\n\nBut Gamarra warned, Republicans have turned the elections into a \"communism versus capitalism\" campaign. \u201cSo many Republicans have resuscitated the cold war. It makes people, like Nicaraguans, more likely to vote Republican when they are putting it in those dichotomous terms,\u201d Gamarra said.\n\nReferring to the policies outlined by Bolton, Cardenas said, \u201cmore often than not, it energizes the base. Will the remarks lead to regime changes? I hope so.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Source: Kaiser Health News By Julie Rovner, Kaiser Health News\n\nVoters this year have told pollsters in no uncertain terms that health care is important to them. In particular, maintaining insurance protections for pre-existing conditions is the top issue to many.\n\nBut the results of the midterm elections are likely to have a major impact on a broad array of other health issues that touch every single American. And how those issues are addressed will depend in large part on which party controls the House and Senate, governors\u2019 mansions and state legislatures around the country.\n\nAll politics is local, and no single race is likely to determine national or even state action. But some key contests can provide something of a barometer of what\u2019s likely to happen over the next two years.\n\nFor example, keep an eye on Kansas. The razor-tight race for governor could determine whether the state expands Medicaid to all people with low incomes, as allowed under the Affordable Care Act. The legislature in that deep red state passed a bill to accept expansion in 2017, but it could not override the veto of then-Gov. Sam Brownback. Of the candidates running for governor in 2018, Democrat Laura Kelly supports expansion, while Republican Kris Kobach does not.\n\nHere are three big health issues that could be drastically affected by Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\n\nProtections for pre-existing conditions are only a small part of the ACA. The law also made big changes to Medicare and Medicaid, employer-provided health plans and the generic drug approval process, among other things.\n\nRepublicans ran hard on promises to get rid of the law in every election since it passed in 2010.\n\nThis year has Democrats on the attack over the votes Republicans took last year on various unsuccessful proposals to remake the health law. Probably the most endangered Democrat in the Senate, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, has hammered her Republican opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer, over his votes in the House for the repeal-and-replace bills. Polls suggest If Heitkamp pulled off a surprise win, health care might well get some of the credit.\n\nIt is not just congressional action that has Republicans playing defense on the ACA. In February, 18 GOP attorneys general and two GOP governors filed a lawsuit seeking a judgment that the law is now unconstitutional because, in the 2017 tax bill, Congress repealed the penalty for not having insurance. Two of those attorneys general \u2014 Missouri\u2019s Josh Hawley and West Virginia\u2019s Patrick Morrisey \u2014 are running for the Senate.\n\nThe attorneys general are running against Democratic incumbents \u2014 Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. And both Republicans are being hotly criticized by their opponents for their participation in the lawsuit.\n\nBut in the end the fate of the ACA depends less on an individual race than on which party winds up in control of Congress.\n\n\u201cIf Democrats take the House \u2026 then any attempt at repeal-and-replace will be kaput,\u201d said John McDonough, a former Democratic Senate aide who helped write the ACA and now teaches at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nConservative health care strategist Chris Jacobs, who worked for Republicans on Capitol Hill, said a new repeal-and-replace effort might not happen even if Republicans are successful Tuesday.\n\n\u201cRepublicans, if they maintain the majority in the House, will have a margin of a half dozen seats \u2014 if they are lucky,\u201d he said. That likely would not allow the party to push through another controversial effort to change the law. Currently there are 42 more Republicans than Democrats in the House. Even so, the GOP barely got its health bill passed out of the House in 2017.\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2012 made it optional for states to expand Medicaid to cover all low-income Americans up to 138 percent of the poverty line ($16,753 for an individual in 2018). Most states have now expanded, particularly since the federal government is paying the vast majority of the cost: 94 percent in 2018, gradually dropping to 90 percent in 2020.\n\nStill, 17 states, all with GOP governors or state legislatures (or both), have yet to expand Medicaid.\n\nFour states \u2014 Nebraska, Idaho, Utah and Montana \u2014 have Medicaid expansion questions on their ballots. All but Montana have yet to expand the program. Montana\u2019s question would eliminate the 2019 sunset date included in its expansion in 2016. But it will be interesting to watch results because the measure has run into big-pocketed opposition: the tobacco industry. The initiative would increase taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products to fund the state\u2019s increased Medicaid costs.\n\nBut the issue is in play in other states, too. Several nonexpansion states have close or closer-than-expected races for governor where the Democrat has made Medicaid expansion a priority.\n\nIn Florida, one of the largest states not to have expanded Medicaid, the Republican candidate for governor is former Rep. Ron DeSantis, who opposes expansion. His Democratic opponent, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, supports it.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s candidates for governor, Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp, also are on opposite sides of the Medicaid expansion debate.\n\nHowever, the legislatures in both states have opposed the expansion.\n\nMedicare\n\nUntil recently, Republicans have remained relatively quiet about efforts to change the popular Medicare program for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nTheir new talking point is that proposals to expand the program \u2014 such as \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d \u2014 could threaten the existing program.\n\n\u201cMedicare is at significant risk of being cut if Democrats take over the House,\u201d Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., told the Lee Montana Newspapers. \u201cMedicare-for-all is Medicare for none. It will gut Medicare, end the VA as we know it, and force Montana seniors to the back of the line.\u201d\n\nGianforte\u2019s Democratic opponent, Kathleen Williams, is proposing another idea popular with Democrats: allowing people age 55 and over to \u201cbuy into\u201d Medicare coverage.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Michelle Lujan Grisham is favored in the polls against House colleague Republican Rep. Steve Pearce. If she does, she would be the first Latina Democratic governor in a state where 48 percent of the population is Hispanic, the largest statewide share in the country. Gov. Susana Martinez is exiting her office after serving as the first Latina Republican.\n\nIn very red Texas, Lupe Valdez remains in an uphill battle against the Republican incumbent, Gov. Greg Abbott. Arizona\u2019s shifting political landscape put David Garcia in position to offer incumbent Gov. Doug Ducey a tough challenge, but as the election nears, polls are showing Ducey leading.\n\nTheir races have not garnered as much attention as those of Stacey Abrams in Georgia, who would be the first African-American female governor in the country ,and Andrew Gillum, who has had to beat back racist attacks in Florida, where he could be its first African-American governor. There are no sitting African-American governors in the country.\n\nAs for Latino governors, there are currently two: Martinez in New Mexico and Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval in Nevada, who is also leaving office.\n\nU.S. Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham speaks to supporters in Albuquerque, M.M., Tuesday, June 5, 2018.

Yet New Mexico has one of the nation's highest poverty rates. She has campaigned on raising the minimum wage and increasing pay for teachers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of work to be done,\u201d Lujan Grisham told The Las Cruces Sun-News. \u201cGetting the economy moving and diversifying it is a top of priority.\u201d\n\nDallas Sheriff Lupe Valdez speaks during the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28, 2016. J. Scott Applewhite / AP file\n\nLUPE VALDEZ\n\nValdez offers several firsts for Texas. She's the first Latina and first openly gay candidate to run for governor. If she wins, she\u2019d also be the first Democrat to lead the state since Ann Richards left office in 1995.\n\nBut Valdez, 71, has had a tough time electrifying voters behind her campaign, although that has picked up to some degree since the primary.\n\nAbbott has held an overwhelming money advantage throughout the race, starting with $44 million and adding millions more. Valdez has had about $1.3 million for her entire campaign, a far cry from what is needed to get on television in a state with several major media markets.\n\nPolls have shown Abbott with double-digit leads throughout much of the campaign, although the most recent Emerson College poll of likely voters had Valdez down 8 percentage points, 51 percent to 43 percent, with 4 percent undecided.\n\nValdez has also had to wage her campaign in the shadow of Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democrat whose Senate bid has garnered national publicity and landed him on television talk shows, including with Ellen DeGeneres and Stephen Colbert. Though O'Rourke has created coattails for the state\u2019s Democratic candidates, they may not be long enough for Texas, a state where 30 percent of all eligible voters are Latinos and where more than 40 percent of those who turned out in the last gubernatorial election voted for Abbott.\n\nValdez, a native of San Antonio, was the first Latina sheriff of Dallas County. She has campaigned, in part, on her story of growing up in the Jim Crow era in San Antonio and how she overcame discrimination, racism and sexism to get a high school education that would prepare her for college, the military and later in criminal justice, despite being one of few women in her jobs.\n\nValdez has hammered on the themes of creating opportunities for those who may not be benefiting as much from Texas\u2019 healthy economy, as well as on increasing state funding of education, providing access to health care and opposing the state\u2019s SB4 law signed by Abbott, that gives law enforcement officers greater immigration enforcement powers.\n\n\u201cI will never, never stop working for the everyday person and you can bet, I will always, always, always, do what is best for the whole,\u201d said Valdez.\n\nMuch of the campaign, Valdez she has hopped around the state in her Toyota Tacoma pickup truck that has her portrait and name plastered on the tailgate. But in the waning days of the campaign, Valdez has been participating with other Democratic candidates on a bus tour around the state.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are coming out and they are not ashamed. We said, \u2018We are giving you permission to be OK with being Democrats in the rural areas,\u2019\u201d Valdez told NBC News at the tail end of a stop in San Antonio before heading to Houston.\n\nWin or lose, Valdez says the conversations she\u2019s had on the road with constituents, particularly with young Latinos, have had an impact and shown what is possible. Valdez relayed the story of a young Latina who overcame her nervousness to shake hands with her.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a Latina in such a high position,\u201d Valdez said the young woman told her, \u201cand I want to say, make sure it is not the last one you see.\u201d\n\nDemocrat David Garcia announces his run for Arizona governor at the state Capitol in Phoenix, on April 12, 2017. AP\n\nDAVID GARCIA\n\nGarcia has based his hopes in his campaign for governor of Arizona on three key areas; first-time voters mobilized by the current political climate, Latino voters\u2019 growing influence in the state and a progressive movement centered around education.\n\nBut a combination of incumbent Gov. Doug Ducey\u2019s message management and the state\u2019s internal politics has been effective in neutralizing Garcia\u2019s strategy.\n\nA former Army veteran turned professor of education at Arizona State University, Garcia told NBC News that reforming education in the state was a major motivator for running, and he has been campaigning against Arizona's extensive use of school vouchers.\n\nGarcia made early headlines against Ducey when the national #RedforEd education movement took hold, leading to teacher strikes and walkouts. But a recent decision by the Arizona Supreme Court removed a key state education tax measure, #InvestInEd, from the November ballot. The measure tried to impose a progressive taxing scheme based on a person's income to raise more money for schools.\n\nProponents of the measure, upset about the court's decision, are quick to point out that all five of the judges in the 5-2 ruling who voted against the measure were Ducey appointees, underscoring the home field advantage Ducey has against Garcia.\n\nWithout an education measure on the ballot, Garcia the \u201ceducation candidate\u201d faces a greater challenge getting registered Arizonans out to vote.\n\nDucey has largely kept President Donald Trump at arm's length. Whatever negative image the president may have with some Arizonans, it doesn\u2019t appear to have had much impact on Ducey.\n\nThe latest poll by NBC News/Marist shows Ducey with a 13-point lead over Garcia among likely voters. By contrast, Martha McSally, the state's Republican candidate for Senate, has embraced the president since winning the primary in July and she lags three points behind Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the same poll.\n\nArizona still has a strong Republican, conservative bent. Garcia chose to broaden his message in a progressive tone similar to others around the country, such as Gillum, Abrams and O\u2019Rourke.\n\n\"Our campaign is focused on giving people something to vote for. We have been organizing for over a year building a volunteer infrastructure that can talk to voters directly across the state and with a message that speaks to people\u2019s experience,\u201d Garcia told NBC News in an email.\n\nGarcia added his campaign is not \"beholden to corporations or lobbyists because we won\u2019t take their money, that means we can work for the people of Arizona,\" said Garcia.\n\nThe question is whether a candidate like Garcia could afford to exclude the establishment in a state where Latinos still are building political infrastructure. Ducey is outspending Garcia almost 2-to-1.\n\nImmigration can't be overlooked when running in a border state. Ducey pilloried Garcia for calling to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement and replacing it with a better enforcement system.\n\nGarcia defended his views on border security over the summer with a reminder of his military service: \"I've been called an open borders guy from some people, and I tell them, I protected those borders,\" Garcia said.\n\nThe growing number of Latino candidates across the state may be an important force in getting Latinos out to the ballot box.\n\nArizona\u2019s election process gives registered voters one month to submit their ballot, either by mail or at designated drop-off locations if they wish to vote early.\n\nArizona, you have a historic opportunity to elect David Garcia for Governor. @dg4az stands for workers.

That makes it more difficult for the Garcia campaign to win the votes of Latinos or others who did not request a ballot to submit early or take to a drop-off location.\n\nVoters still can show up on Election Day and ask for ballots at their polling places.\n\nWith just a few days to go, Garcia got a helping hand from filmmaker and activist Mark Ruffalo, who played Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk in Marvel's \"Avengers\" movies.\n\n\"You have the opportunity to elect your first Latino.

Toxicology tests showed the presence of Ativan along with barbiturates, caffeine, the anti-opioid drug naloxone, and a decongestant.\n\nBut the autopsy report said the drugs were not a cause of death.\n\nThe lawsuit says the doctor knew that Cornell had a serious history of substance abuse, and he failed to examine or consult with him as he was prescribing the drugs.\n\nThe \"unmonitored use of such excessive amounts of Lorazepam ... was known to increase the risk of suicide because it can severely impair judgment, thinking and impulse control and diminish the ability of a patient to think and act rationally,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nVicky Cornell, right, and family Toni, Christopher and Lilli Jean Cornell holds vigil on the anniversary of Chris Cornell's death at the Hollywood Forever Cemetary on May 18, 2018 in Hollywood, California.

And the terrorist who committed this crime, he was quoted as saying, 'They bring in baiters and then kill our people.

The manslaughter charge, a felony, is the more serious of the two and can carry jail time.\n\nCorine Mack, president of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg branch of the NAACP, said forcing Lee, who is black, to go through the criminal justice system for a death that no one is suggesting was intentional speaks to a larger problem facing people of color.\n\n\"We know that African-Americans are disproportionately charged and arrested in this country, and this is no different,\" Mack said. \"This mother was already traumatized because of the loss of her child. Now she's being traumatized again. They're doing more than making an example of her \u2014 they don't see her life as something that matters.\"\n\nJetton said he met with Lee and her family on Wednesday, but she has not announced legal representation and did not return a request for comment.\n\nWhile some details of what happened on the night of Sept. 16 remain murky, officials say Lee and her son, Kaiden, were overcome amid the chaotic Category 1 storm, which contributed to approximately 50 deaths across three states.\n\nThe Union County Sheriff's Office said it conducted an \"exhaustive investigation,\" and Sheriff Eddie Cathey noted in a statement that after \"taking all facts into consideration and applying the law, we feel that these charges are appropriate.\"\n\nCathey would not discuss what exactly prompted the charges, but told NBC News that \"charges are made a lot of times in accidents and other things in which a child's death has occurred. This is one of those cases,\" adding that the circumstances are \"heartbreaking.\"\n\nJetton said the Lee family has several questions of their own that need answers.\n\n\"Every tragedy does not equal a crime,\" he added. \"Just because someone is in your care and they die, doesn't mean a crime has been committed.\"\n\nPolice reports and interviews that Lee gave in the days after her son's death fill in some of what occurred: Lee said she was driving on Highway 218 in New Salem, a rural community about 35 miles east of Charlotte, and came upon a local creek that overflowed as Florence was raking the region. Authorities in Union County had placed barriers on portions of the highway that were impassable, officials said.\n\nLee was in the car with Kaiden, attempting to check on her great-grandmother, who lived another 20 miles away, after they lost communication.\n\nAt some point, her car was swept up in 10 feet of water and slammed a tree, Cathey said, according to NBC affiliate WCNC.\n\n\"When she was trying to get out of the water, she lost control of the child and then the rescue team rescued her, but the child was lost,\" the sheriff added.\n\nLee said she was able to get Kaiden out of his car seat, but lost his grip as they maneuvered through the waters. The following morning, the boy's body was found wedged between the car's bumper and the tree.\n\nLee's version of events and what officials say happen diverges here: Lee said she had seen other cars cross the road safely and she never knowingly drove around a barricade, which she believed other people may have moved. But Cathey in September was adamant there were barriers up: \"She did drive around the barricades and proceeded on 218,\" he said, according to WCNC.\n\nThe District Attorney's office in Union County said it does not comment on cases in which potential charges are pending.\n\nRobert DeCurtins, a criminal defense attorney in Charlotte, said authorities' logic in prosecuting Lee may hinge on that fact that she had a duty to ensure her son was being protected \u2014 which also meant she did not act recklessly.\n\n\"What will be interesting is, even though there was a death, the fact is she made a mistake,\" DeCurtins said. \"She didn't believe that there would be this type of outcome, or I'm sure she would have never done it. On the other hand, I don't know if she understood the environment, and just how bad it was.\"\n\nDeCurtins said there still remains a burden of proof for prosecutors in a case of involuntary manslaughter, which means a person acted criminally negligent when they unintentionally caused a death.\n\nJetton added that even if barriers were up as officials suggest, someone could have moved them or they could have swept away during the high winds and pouring rains \u2014 all factors that could play a part in whether Lee is culpable.\n\nIn a similar circumstance in South Carolina, two mental health patients being transported by Horry County Sheriff's deputies during Florence drowned when their van was overtaken by flooding. The deputies were fired last week, and state law enforcement is investigating possible charges against them. Officials said they believe the deputies drove around a barricade.\n\nLee is scheduled to appear in court on a criminal summons later this month.", "By Tim Fitzsimons\n\nPaul Makonda, governor of Tanzania's largest city, Dar es Salaam, vowed this week to begin mass arrests of \u201chomosexuals in our city,\u201d starting on Monday.\n\n\"I have received reports that there are so many homosexuals in our city, and these homosexuals are advertising and selling their services on the internet,\" Makonda said in a video posted to YouTube this past Monday.\n\n\"Therefore, I am announcing this to every citizen of Dar es Salaam: If you know any gays ... report them to me,\u201d he said in the clip, which was translated from Swahili by CNN.

The committee, according to the activist, will consist of police officers, psychologists, telecom regulators and film regulators. He said the committee will target suspected gay people through social media and other online forms of networking.\n\nThe Refugee Coalition of East Africa, a registered LGBTQ community organization in neighboring Kenya, called the committee \"an anti-LGBTQI surveillance squad\" and sent a message to sexual and gender minorities in Tanzania: \"We understand your plight and we have lived through your fear. If you choose to flee to Kenya, please know that we are here for you and we highly encourage you to reach out to any of our member organizations for support.\"\n\nHomosexuality is punishable in Tanzania by a prison sentence of 30 years to life, one of the harshest punishments in the world for same-sex intimacy, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe LGBTQ activist said Makonda\u2019s rise began shortly after he was elected to office in 2016. Makonda reportedly rounded up sex workers and gay men and performed \u201cforced anal exams,\u201d a debunked Victorian-era practice where doctors attempt to determine a person\u2019s homosexuality. The United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say the practice can amount to torture.\n\n\u201cFor now it is very difficult; everyone is afraid,\u201d the activist said. \u201cAs I am talking to you, most LGBT organizations have been shut down.\u201d The activist recounted a 2016 party hosted by a friend where the police raided and arrested 20 people. The police then performed forced anal examinations on them, which Human Rights Watch reports is the first documented instance of the practice\u2019s use in Tanzania.\n\nThe Citizen, a Tanzanian newspaper, reported from the Wednesday press conference that Makonda framed the crackdown as an attempt to regulate sex workers, who he accuses of advertising their services on social media. He warned locals that they had until Monday to \u201cmake sure that they have deleted pornographic pictures from their phones, because I wouldn\u2019t like to see a public figure arrested due to photos included in his or her phone.\u201d\n\nThe activist said Makonda has framed the anti-gay campaign as \u201cfor Tanzania, because those gay issues are against our norms, against God, against both beliefs, Islam and Christianity.\u201d\n\nTanzania has earned a reputation for homophobia, according to Neela Ghoshal, a senior LGBTQ rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, and Makonda is known for being one of the most outspoken homophobic officials in the country.\n\n\u201cHe is notorious for having essentially kicked off an ongoing two-year crackdown on LGBTQ people in Tanzania, starting in 2016,\u201d Ghoshal said. \u201cThere have been peaks and slower times in that crackdown, but it's been basically really bad.\u201d\n\nGhoshal said that unlike Tanzania\u2019s northern neighbors, Kenya and Uganda, Tanzania has few public and open LGBTQ figures who will speak their truth on television and in the media. Even in Uganda, whose president, Yoweri Museveni, in 2014 signed a law that increased the penalties for being gay, there are public figures who respond to homophobia in the media.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a chicken or egg environment,\" Ghoshal said. \"It is so hostile that people do not come out, so people don\u2019t have a basic understanding of the issue.\"\n\nTanzanians, she added, \"just absorb the hate speech of religious leaders and politicians,\" because \"there is no counter narrative.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

He added that Fox News critics are people who are most likely not watching it.\n\nFox News has been under fire for perpetuating conspiracy theories and has even taken criticism from Matt Drudge, who runs the popular conservative news aggregator the Drudge Report.

Typically, that is either highly rated entertainment content or live sports.\n\nFox agreed to sell its regional sports networks to Disney as part of the $71.3 billion deal, but Disney is now selling them as part of an agreement with government regulators for approval of the deal.\n\nIf Disney isn't able to command the price it wants within 90 days of the close of the Disney deal, Fox could be in line to buy them back.\n\nWhen asked about that interest, Murdoch told NBC News in a conversation after the interview that the sale process was ongoing.\n\n\"We're in the process now of helping Disney sell them,\" Murdoch said. \"We expect at the end of that process, once Disney has a sense of where they are, they'll make a decision.\"\n\nWhen asked if New Fox would make a bid if Disney hasn't sold the regional sports networks, he responded, \"Honestly, we don't know.\"", "By Associated Press\n\nST.

Officer Darren Wilson resigned and was never charged in the shooting.\n\nMcKinnies told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that her son was upbeat before his death, not suicidal. She said he didn't know how to tie the knots used in the ligature, and the sheet didn't match sheets from the family home.\n\nJones had packed an overnight bag found on the patio, suggesting that he trusted and had planned to leave the house with the person who killed him, McKinnies said.\n\nMcKinnies and other activists are urging police to take a harder look at the possibility that Jones was killed.\n\nThe St. Louis County medical examiner's determination of the cause of death could take several weeks.

Eighty-eight percent of young Democrats and 40 percent of young Republicans favor government-run health insurance, according to the poll. Roughly two-thirds of young independents are in favor.\n\nThe American Medical Association, which has supported Obama's health care law, said that it doesn't track the political leanings of its member doctors but that the number of female doctors overall reflects recent diversity in the field.\n\n\"As half of all medical school students today are women, it's no surprise that female physicians are increasingly politically active,\" Dr. Barbara L. McAneny, president of the group, said in a statement. \"The physician perspective is critical in the legislative process.\"\n\nThe other three female doctors running for Congress as Democrats are Hiral Tipirneni, an emergency room doctor in Arizona; Kyle Horton, a former Veterans Affairs doctor in North Carolina; and Danielle Mitchell, a family physician in Tennessee.\n\nIf one of them is elected, she would be the first Democratic female doctor in Congress.

With more than $25 million pouring in, it has already doubled the previous state record.\n\nIt's one of two dozen districts nationwide held by the GOP but whose voters chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. It's one of the tightest midterm races and a critical potential pickup for Democrats trying to take the House for the first time since 2010.\n\nRossi, the Republican candidate, has called Schrier a product of an anti-Trump movement who lacks leadership experience. He said he supports future efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal Obama's signature health care law, suggesting instead a \"high risk\" insurance pool for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nRossi, a 59-year-old real estate investor, paints Schrier's priority of expanding Medicare as a \"government takeover of health care\" that lacks funding details.\n\n\"Is there some other scheme that she has to pay for this?

We might expect to feel a bit sleepy or maybe even a little \u201coff.\u201d But springing forward or falling back an hour can have other surprising effects: It\u2019s linked to changes in our health, diet and even tendency to get into an accident.\n\n\u201cSleep is a kind of outward symbol of the timing processes of our body,\u201d explained Chris Winter, M.D., author of \u201cThe Sleep Solution\u201d and president of the Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine clinic in Virginia. \u201cOur bodies function on an internal schedule, from hormone release to body temperature to cognition \u2013 and sleep is linked to them all.\u201d\n\nAppetite\n\nBlame this one on the hormones. \u201cAppetite in general is often not the body requesting food; it\u2019s the body anticipating food,\u201d Dr. Winter explained. \u201cWhen your body knows you eat lunch around 12:30 p.m. or so every day, it anticipates and prepares for the meal.\u201d\n\nYour body receives those signals from hormones, like ghrelin, which increases our cravings so we\u2019re motivated to eat, and leptin, which affects feelings of satiety. \u201cThese two hormones are intimately associated with sleep, which is part of why when we\u2019re not sleeping well, we tend to overeat,\u201d Dr. Winter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tight hormonal balance and daylight-saving shifts can absolutely throw it off.\u201d\n\nAccidents\n\nSpeaking of being thrown off, you may find daylight saving time shifts make you feel mentally fuzzy or slow. Sleep disruptions can conversely affect cognitive performance.\n\nBack in 1999, Johns Hopkins and Stanford University researchers published a comprehensive study that analyzed 21 years\u2019 worth of fatal car crash data. They found a small but notable increase in car crash deaths on the Monday after the switch to daylight saving time in the spring: 83.5 deaths, compared with 78.2 deaths on the average Monday.\n\nAnd studies of workplace-specific accidents have uncovered similar links. Research published in 2009 showed the Monday after switching to daylight saving time saw a 5.7 percent jump in workplace injuries, and nearly 68 percent more workdays lost to injuries, meaning they were more severe. These conclusions were reached by analyzing U.S. Department of Labor and Mine Safety and Health Administration injury data from 1983 to 2006.\n\nMood\n\nHere again, disruptions in our normal sleep schedule can throw off hormonal balances. Lack of proper sleep can exacerbate depressive feelings, anxiety, irritability, and mental exhaustion.\n\nStudies show even partial sleep deprivation can have a negative effect on mood, and as Dr. Winter pointed out, this effect can snowball: When you feel stressed and anxious thanks to lack of sleep from the previous night, it\u2019s hard to settle down for that night\u2019s rest, too.\n\nIf you have teens in the house, take special note: \u201cThe effects of [daylight saving time] can have more impact on adolescents,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 U. Aguillon, M.D., assistant professor at the University of Toledo\u2019s medical school and program director of the university\u2019s Sleep Medicine Fellowship Program. \u201cNot only do they require more sleep than adults, but their habitual sleep-wake timing is typically delayed.\u201d\n\nThe spring forward has links to heart attack and certain strokes\n\n\u201cThe heart has a pretty significant circadian rhythm,\u201d said Winter, who has studied brain-blood flow during sleep. \u201cWe tend to see that disrupted sleep may make people more vulnerable when we wake up \u2013 not causing a heart attack but perhaps exacerbating underlying conditions.\u201d\n\nA 2014 U.S. study showed one hour of sleep during the \"spring forward\" to daylight saving time raised the risk of having a heart attack the following Monday by 24 percent compared to other Mondays during the year. By contrast, when \u201cfalling back\u201d later in the year to gain an extra hour of sleep, heart attack risk fell 21 percent on the following Tuesday after returning to standard time.\n\nSimilarly, a study presented at the American Academy of Neurology\u2019s 2016 conference showed daylight saving time transitions may be linked to an increased risk of ischemic stroke.\n\nTips to adjust: Do's and don\u2019ts\n\nDo get as much light as possible when you wake up. Sure, you may not feel like throwing open those curtains as soon as you open your eyes. But this is \u201cby far the most effective way to jumpstart the change,\u201d Dr. Winter said. \u201cYour body sets its rhythm in large part by light.\u201d\n\nDo exercise in the A.M. This gets you up and moving, as well as exposing you to light and raising your body temperature \u2013 all great ways to wake your body up.\n\nDo go to bed at your typical time Saturday night before the clocks change. \u201cAs we are a typically sleep-deprived society, we should take advantage of the extra hour of sleep,\u201d Dr. Aguillon said.\n\nDon\u2019t over-caffeinate. Enjoy your morning cup, or whatever your usual coffee habit may be. But don\u2019t alter your caffeine routine by, for example, chugging a cup or two in the afternoon because you feel a slump.\n\nDon\u2019t take a nap. \u201cThis is where people fall off the wagon,\u201d Dr. Winter said. \u201cThey\u2019re tired so they nap in the middle of the day, but then when it\u2019s time to go to bed that night or the next night they\u2019re not ready, which can have a bad snowball effect.\u201d\n\nFor more advice like this, sign up for the Know Your Value newsletter and follow Know Your Value on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that 42 percent of patients depleted 100 percent of their assets \u2014 an average loss of $92,000 \u2014 within two years of diagnosis.\n\nPrecision medicine involves running expensive tests called genomic sequencing, which scan the DNA of tumors to find mutations that might be susceptible to available drugs. Although the field is relatively new, hundreds of thousands of cancer patients have had their tumors sequenced to identify cancer-related mutations, according to testing companies.\n\nMedicare, the government insurance plan for people 65 and older, announced in March that it will pay for genomic testing for people with advanced cancers \u2014 a decision that could add $2.5 billion to federal health care costs, according to a May analysis in Health Affairs.\n\nFew private insurers cover the tests, leaving some patients with surprise medical bills.\n\nKristen Kilmer was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer at 38. Kristina Barker / for Kaiser Health News\n\nCarrie Wyman, who also has advanced breast cancer, discovered that her insurance plan doesn\u2019t cover genomic sequencing only after she received a $5,800 statement.\n\n\u201cI just assumed it would be covered,\u201d said Wyman, 50, a resident of La Plata, Md., who has six children and stepchildren. \u201cI was blindsided, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nLooking for Financial Assistance\n\nYet paying for that initial test is just the beginning. As Kilmer learned, finding the money for ongoing treatment is far more challenging.\n\nIn some cases, genomic tests match patients to experimental drugs available only in clinical trials. Although these trials sometimes provide free medications, many cancer patients can\u2019t afford to travel to participate in them. Kilmer drives 12 hours round-trip every month to participate in a clinical trial in Sioux Falls, S.D. The expenses add up quickly, she said.\n\nKilmer\u2019s genomic tests identified a rearrangement in the PALB2 gene. Preliminary studies suggest that tumors with this genetic rearrangement could be susceptible to the drug Lynparza, but those effects haven\u2019t been definitively proven in large-scale studies. The Food and Drug Administration has approved Lynparza only for breast cancer patients with a mutation called BRCA.\n\nLegally, doctors can prescribe Lynparza \u201coff label\u201d to anyone with cancer. But insurance programs are reluctant to cover off-label treatments, unless they\u2019re specifically recommended in expert guidelines.\n\nKilmer has spent much of the past three years battling insurance officials and begging drug companies for financial assistance. The drugmakers have been generous, allowing her to take a rotating cocktail of experimental drugs for free because of her modest income.\n\nIn September, however, AstraZeneca decided to end Kilmer\u2019s financial aid. Kilmer appealed the drug company\u2019s decision.\n\nPaying thousands of dollars a month is not an option, Kilmer said. Her family already carries significant credit card debt from earlier cancer treatments. She estimates that she has spent $80,600 out of pocket treating her illness, including $23,600 on her early breast cancer therapy and $57,000 treating metastatic disease.\n\nKilmer said she would rather stop taking Lynparza than financially burden her daughter and husband, a truck driver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not worth it,\u201d Kilmer said. \u201cI will not put my family into that kind of debt.\u201d\n\nUncertain Benefits\n\nInsurers say costs aren\u2019t their only concern. Evidence is lacking that the precision-medicine approach will work consistently, they argue.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said genetic sequencing remains unproven.\n\nCathryn Donaldson, the group\u2019s spokeswoman, described recent scientific advances as \u201cremarkable and noteworthy.\u201d But she said insurers \u201cneed a more definitive answer\u201d about whether the tests help the average patient live longer.\n\nThe South Dakota State Employee Health Plan \u2014 which runs Kilmer\u2019s insurance plan \u2014 said it bases its coverage decisions on science and reviews \u201cpublished, randomized data about the safety and efficacy of the requested drugs.\u201d\n\nAlthough genetic testing has become the standard of care for melanoma and a common type of lung cancer, no one knows if genomic sequencing will extend the lives of people with other types of cancer, said Dr. Carolyn Presley, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\nWithout insurance coverage, some cancer patients simply give up on treatment.\n\nA study of more than 1,000 women with advanced breast cancer \u2014 presented at a September meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology \u2014 found that 54 percent had stopped or refused treatment due to cost. The women in the study may have been more vulnerable than most, because 30 percent were uninsured, about twice the national rate.\n\nKristen Kilmer with her daughter and her husband, Chet Kilmer, outside their home. Kristina Barker / for Kaiser Health News\n\nIn an August study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that relatively few of those who hoped to benefit from precision medicine actually ended up on a medication. Just 15 percent of those who underwent genomic sequencing ended up taking a targeted therapy, according to the study. The study didn\u2019t ask participants why they failed to get a targeted drug, but Presley, the lead author, said some patients probably couldn\u2019t afford them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding the mutations, but patients aren\u2019t getting the drugs,\u201d Presley said. Without insurance, she said, \u201cyou and I would not be able to afford these medications. It\u2019s a huge barrier.\u201d\n\nWithin hours of the publication of this article, AstraZeneca called Kilmer to notify her that it would continue to provide financial aid. Her medication arrived in the mail the next day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge relief,\u201d Kilmer said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Pete Williams\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department revealed Thursday that a federal grand jury has charged companies in China and Taiwan with a scheme to steal trade secrets from Micron, the Idaho-based firm that controls up to a quarter of the dynamic random access memory industry.\n\nIn addition to the companies, three individual Taiwanese nationals were charged.\n\nJustice Department officials said it was the latest in a growing number of attempts by Chinese entities to pilfer American technology.\n\nChina is \"shamelessly bent on stealing its way up the ladder of economic development and doing so at American expense,\" said John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security.\n\nFederal prosecutors said one of the defendants served as president of a company acquired by Micron five years ago. The charges said he went to work for the Taiwan company, United Microelectronics Corporation, and orchestrated the theft of trade secrets from Micron worth nearly $9 billion.\n\nThat company, the charges said, then partnered with a Chinese state-owned business, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, so that China could steal the technology from the United States. The random-access technology involved was not possessed by the Chinese until very recently, the Justice Department said.\n\nAlex Tse, the U.S. attorney in San Francisco, where the charges were filed, said the Chinese have not yet begun making products using the American technology.\n\n\"We are going to do everything we can to prevent the further dissemination of the unlawful stolen property,\" he said.\n\nThis week, the Commerce Department took action to block the Chinese company from buying goods and services in the United States, to keep it from profiting from the technology it stole. And the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit, seeking a court order that would block the Chinese and Taiwan companies from transferring the stolen technology or exporting products to the U.S. based on it.\n\n\"We are not just reacting to crimes. We are acting to block the defendants from doing any more harm to Micron,\" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions in announcing the charges.\n\nSessions said he was setting up a task force in the Justice Department to devote more resources to fighting Chinese economic espionage.\n\n\"It is time for China to join the community of lawful nations. International trade has been good for China, but the cheating must stop,\" he said.\n\nDavid Bowdich, the FBI's deputy director, said nearly every one of its 56 field offices nationwide is investigating cases of economic espionage that lead back to China.", "Get the Better newsletter.\n\nBy Nicole Spector\n\nThe midterm elections are turning out to be nearly as stressful as the 2016 presidential election \u2014 especially for Democrats.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by YouGov and commissioned by the fitness site Daily Burn, Democrats are 50 percent more likely than Republicans to say they\u2019re \u201ceating their feelings\u201d as a result of the current political climate. They\u2019re also drinking more (a 2-to-1 ratio over their GOP counterparts).\n\nThe ostensibly good news is that these stressed out Democrats are also working out more, by as much as 40 percent; but even exercise can be overdone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing some people so stressed at the moment they're doing two, even three soul cycle classes at day,\u201d Dr. Navya Mysore, a primary care doctor, tells NBC News BETTER. \u201cExercise is good for you, but too much is not. You [risk] dehydration and your body needs time to rest and rejuvenate.\u201d\n\nBinging on de-stressors backfires\n\nWhat appears to be happening among many concerned voters, is that they\u2019re resorting excessively to the habits that help us de-stress, whether that\u2019s eating, drinking or exercising.\n\n\u201cDepending on how you\u2019re used to dealing with stress, people tend to gravitate toward that habit more,\u201d says Dr. Mysore. \u201cIf you had a hard day, you\u2019ll have a glass of wine, so maybe you\u2019re doing that more. Same for people who are stress eaters \u2014 they\u2019ll eat more. If you're more prone to sweat it out when stressed, then you'll do that more.\u201d\n\nBinging almost always leaves us feeling crummy, even if what we\u2019re binging on is as benign as Netflix (which Daily Burn\u2019s poll found both Democrats and Republicans are doing plenty of in reaction to the fraught political climate).\n\nHow do we stop the stress-induced madness?\n\nWe turned to health experts for practical tips on managing binge-y behavior when stressed.\n\nTurn off the news if you need to \u2014 it\u2019s firing up your limbic system\n\nThe first step in managing election-related stress is to disconnect, if only periodically, from the news.\n\n\u201cOn a practical level, try to limit the amount of news you consume on a daily basis,\u201d says Allison Abrams, a psychotherapist and licensed clinical social worker. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean not stay informed, rather, be informed but set boundaries for yourself.\u201d\n\nBoundaries with the news are necessary if we want to maintain our mental well being because the news is so often an emotionally negative experience. It can, as Loretta Brady, Ph.D, professor of psychology at Saint Anselm College puts it \u201cfire up our limbic system, the emotion center of our brain.\u201d\n\nEating and drinking start out great, but then\u2026\n\n\u201cThis activation leaves us physiologically reacting to stress even though our immediate circumstances may not be different,\u201d Brady notes. \u201cWe may be less aware of our response to this stress, mindlessly reaching for substances that calm the reactivity, substances like sweets and comfort food are plentiful at this time of year, between autumn chili cook-offs and Halloween candy. We do get mood boosts from consuming such food, but also some consequences we may not intend.\u201d\n\nAlcohol has a similarly euphoric effect \u2014 but things can quickly go downhill.\n\n\u201cIf you find you unwind with wine, which is normally what happens with a certain amount of alcohol, and then on top of that you enjoy the habit, serotonin will also be released,\u201d says Dr. Mysore. \u201cThose first sips or first bite of cake, you've filled that need and you feel better. \u2018It's so worth it,\u2019 is what first goes through your mind. But if you go overboard, you will lose that serotonin effect. You'll start to wind down a path where you'll get a serotonin dip, have sleep disruption, get a headache can add to anxiety or depression if you have a preexisting condition.\u201d\n\nYou should still exercise, but space out the tough workouts\n\nThough too much exercise can be hard on your body, working out is generally still a positive way to reduce stress.\n\nDr. Mysore recommends alternating high intensity workouts by at least every other day, and doing lighter workouts on the other days (these lighter ones can still be cardio, but go easy on the weights).\n\n\u201cI suggest no matter where you are in your level or capacity that you get in at least 150 minutes of moderate cardio per week,\u201d says Mysore. \u201cModerate means your heart rate is up and you're sweating. This helps prevent and reduce cardiovascular disease. I think doing this all in one day is too much. I will often tell people who want to do more to stick to no more than one workout a day. If you're doing body weight exercises, those space out every other day. Do a low impact workout the next day like yoga, pilates or some light cardio. Spacing it out will provide a great endorphin release but won\u2019t make your body burn out. Even working out for 10 minutes can help.\u201d\n\nKeep a food-mood journal to connect the dots\n\nIf you\u2019re emotionally eating, Jonathan Alpert, a psychotherapist, executive performance coach and author of \u201cBe Fearless: Change Your Life in 28 Days,\u201d recommends keeping a daily list of what you\u2019re eating along with how you\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cMake columns with the following headers: What type of food am I reaching for?; What\u2019s my emotional state?; What\u2019s going on in my life right now that\u2019s leading to this emotion?; What\u2019s an alternative behavior to eating [this if its unhealthy]?\u201d\n\nYou may still reach for those chips or ice cream after making your list, but at least you can connect the dots about why you\u2019re doing this and recognize if you\u2019re feeling more poorly than you realize. Ideally though you can take this pause as an opportunity to stop in your tracks and make a better food choice or pick up a book instead of a pint.\n\nDon\u2019t keep junk food or booze at home\n\nThe easier it is to access a vice, the more you\u2019re likely to access it. Keep the sweets and liquor outside of the house if you\u2019re trying to ease up on indulging.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re not at home, then you\u2019re less likely to eat them,\u201d says Alpert. \u201cInstead, keep healthy alternatives nearby such as fruit slices and vegetable sticks. You might also freeze grapes to provide a frozen treat, or eat Greek yogurt to simulate the texture of ice cream.\u201d\n\nIf keeping this stuff out of your home isn\u2019t an option (let\u2019s say this past weekend you held a World Series party), then just simply keeping them out of easy reach can be effective.\n\n\u201cMake [junk] foods hard to get to, such as keeping them on the top shelf of a rarely used cabinet,\u201d suggests Sari Chait, Ph.D, a clinical psychologist and owner of the Behavioral Health and Wellness Center in Newton, Massachusetts. \u201cIf you have to work hard to get to the potato chips, it gives you a minute to stop and reset. That built0in pause can be enough to help you remember that you don\u2019t want to eat that food and to instead do something like a breathing exercise or go for a walk to deal with your anxiety.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t engage in negative self-talk\n\nIf you\u2019re eating a tin of Pringles while you\u2019re reading this, resist thinking badly about yourself.\n\n\u201cSelf-talk can be your worst enemy or your best friend. Thinking, \u2018I\u2019m such an emotional mess and pig\u2019 will probably keep you stuck in unhealthy patterns,\u201d says Alpert. \u201cWhile thoughts such as \u2018I am going to take charge of my health and manage stress better\u2019 will lead to better behaviors and a healthier lifestyle.\u201d\n\nGet out of your head and out in the community\n\nEmotional eating, drinking your feelings and even excess workouts aren\u2019t productive ways of handling any amount of stress, and they certainly won\u2019t help shift the results of the election.\n\nRather than succumbing to this lonely feeling of powerlessness, get more involved with the political changes you want to see.\n\n\u201cFind a way to get involved in the process \u2014 go out and vote, volunteer for a cause you believe in and contribute to causes that you find important,\u201d says Dr. Helen Odessky is a licensed clinical psychologist and author of \u201cStop Anxiety From Stopping You: The Breakthrough Program for Conquering Panic and Social Anxiety.\u201d\n\nBy making a difference hands-on, even in small ways, you\u2019ll probably feel more inspired to get back on track to the things that help defeat stress on a daily level like gratitude, positivity and self-care.\n\nMORE STRESS-BUSTING TIPS\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Anne Thompson\n\nThe crisis in the Roman Catholic Church over its handling of allegations of sexual abuse by its clergy is engulfing the diocese in Buffalo, New York, where a former executive assistant to the bishop says she has talked to the FBI and turned over documents about an alleged cover-up of sexual abuse by priests.\n\nSiobahn O'Connor says that while working for Bishop Richard Malone, she took calls from frustrated victims who tried to use the diocese hotline for complaints but to no avail. O'Connor says she was upset by the perceived lack of help for victims and then disturbed by what she called the \"crafting\" of a list of accused priests made public by the diocese this past March.\n\nO'Connor tells NBC News there were over 100 priests on that original list but when it was published there were only 42.\n\n\"That was just appalling to me that they were creating this list that was woefully inaccurate, but it was also, it was a lie. We were lying to the people, while the bishop was also saying, \u2018We're being transparent.\u2019 And I knew that was not true.\"\n\nAs for the hotline that was supposedly established, O'Connor says it wasn't all that it should have been.\n\n\"Well, for something called a hotline, it was very cold. Because the calls were actually sent to an abandoned office that was then dialed into remotely from the victim assistance coordinator. So for the first three weeks, you actually couldn't have received a live response,\" she said.\n\nSiobhan O'Connor speaks to reporters regarding the Buffalo Catholic Diocese. WGRZ\n\nEarlier this month, the Diocese of Buffalo acknowledged receiving a subpoena from the local U.S. attorney's office for documents several months ago. The New York attorney general has also launched an investigation into every diocese in the state.\n\nAnd Buffalo and every diocese in the country have been asked by the U.S. Attorney in Pennsylvania to preserve documents on sexual abuse.\n\nSpecifically, the letter from the U.S. Attorney in Eastern Pennsylvania, obtained by NBC News, requests \u201call documents related to sexual conduct involving a minor.\u201d\n\nThe request includes documents from any their \"secret archives\" or \u201cconfidential files.\u201d It also includes documents relating to any incidents involving those alleged to have engaged in sexual conduct with a minor \"transporting any minor across any state or international border,\" among other records.\n\nO'Connor worked for Malone for three years before resigning in August. She said Wednesday that the FBI has reached out to her about what she may know about a potential cover-up.\n\n\"Well, they wanted to know more about what I witnessed,\" O'Connor told NBC News on Wednesday. \"And they assured me that they were going to take this very seriously, and that they were actively working on it. And they were grateful that I would assist them.\"\n\nMass at St. Joseph Cathedral in Buffalo, N.Y., on Feb. 13, 2013. David Duprey / AP file\n\nShe says Malone and his senior staff removed priests from a list of priests accused of abuse if there was only one allegation.\n\n\"I would always think, \u2018But that's one life. That's one victim.\u2019 If the diocese had determined that the claim wasn't substantiated \u2026 I would say, \u2018Well, by whose investigation was that determined?\u2019\n\nO'Connor has joined with Deacon Paul Snyder, an ordained minister in the diocese, for calling on the Bishop Malone to step down.\n\n\"He has betrayed his people,\" Snyder said of Malone. \"He has acted with cowardice, he has lied. He has been proven to lie. \"\n\nSnyder's pastor was removed from the ministry this summer. The pastor was not on the list originally and Snyder says the pastor was removed because of O'Connor's actions.\n\nA spokesperson for the Buffalo diocese said Malone said he has no intention of stepping down.\n\nIn a statement, Malone has acknowledged mistakes have been made in the past and he himself has made mistakes.\n\nThe bishop said he was \"stunned and dismayed\" by O'Connor's comments but the statement did not rebute her allegations. The statement released by the diocese included what they said were emails by O'Connor that say she missed working at the diocese and with Malone.\n\nIn response, O'Connor said it was never about her. \"This is about the survivors, our diocese, our community and our church.\"", "Boxers or briefs: It matters more than you might think 01:48", "By Charles Lam\n\nWhile Asian Americans make up 4.1 percent of of voting-age citizens in the U.S., they are the fastest growing racial group in the country, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nResearchers expect the voting bloc to double by 2040, and Asian-American voters could end up swinging 27 congressional races this year, according to AAPI Data, a research program at the University of California, Riverside.\n\nHere are 10 congressional races where Asian-American candidates or voters could have a particular impact.\n\nArizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District\n\nWhile Asian-Americans represent only 4.2 percent of residents in Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District, the race just northwest of Phoenix pits incumbent Republican Rep.

It pains me to see produce tied up in a garbage bag for multiple reasons: I\u2019m well aware of how many people don\u2019t have easy access to all of the produce I conveniently pick up on my walk home from work; I could have used those ingredients to create healthy meals; and I also see dollar signs going right into the garbage can along with my wilting kale and mushy zucchini.\n\nI\u2019m not alone: In the United States, 31 percent of the available food supply at the retail and consumer levels in 2010 went uneaten. And those of us who eat a healthy diet are some of the biggest culprits: A study published in the journal Plos One found that the healthiest Americans are the most wasteful, because of their high consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are frequently thrown out.\n\nWhile there are a confluence of factors that affect food waste, one that we have direct control over is how much we are throwing away in our own households. And I, for one, know that the organization of my fridge (or, the lack thereof) is largely to blame for my own waste. I bring home my grocery store haul and shove everything into drawers and stack them on shelves, without much rhyme or reason. And without fail on a weekly basis there is a slimy bag of greens or a half-eaten jar of tomato sauce with questionable coloring that was shoved into the back and forgotten and has to be tossed.\n\nCertainly taking the time to put a better system in place could make a huge difference, but if my closets are any indication, my home organization skills are wanting. So I called in reinforcements.\n\nGilat Tunit, founder of Project Neat, a professional home organization company, says that establishing an organization system in your refrigerator is as simple as investing in a few affordable products that will make your fridge more efficient by maximizing space.\n\nThe goal is to \u201ccontain items, categorize them and separate them,\u201d says Tunit. \u201cIt\u2019s really important in a fridge to be able to access things. What happens to most when [storing food is] you have to move one thing out of the way to get to the other things. How many times do you open your fridge and have to pull out the entire fridge just to reach the dressing all the way in the back? We are all guilty of that process, but it\u2019s not our fault! The options that the fridge comes with is the issue in itself. It\u2019s basically open shelving and no real direction as to what should go where.\u201d But what many people don\u2019t realize is that we\u2019re not stuck working with the structure our particular fridge allots us.\n\n\u201c[The fridge] is the last place one imagines a possibility for organization. We assume that our fridge will just always be messy because it\u2019s used on such a consistent basis.\u201d says Tunit. \u201c[People] also don\u2019t realize how inexpensive it can be to make it organized and much more functional. A lot of times the products we can use to keep a fridge organized are the same as what we would use in a different part of our home.\u201d\n\nReady to give your own fridge a makeover? Tunit shares her affordable, product picks that will make every fridge more efficient \u2014 and make it easier to stock up on healthy ingredients (without any of them ending up in the trash).\n\nBETTER editors, writers and experts take care to recommend items we really like and hope you\u2019ll enjoy!

In my fridge I use it for condiments. There\u2019s no rummaging, no moving things out of the way, you spin it and grab whatever you need. People think if they have a lot of stuff, they can\u2019t organize it, but that\u2019s not true. As long as you contain it and have everything categorized, you can have as much stuff as you want and it will still be organized.\u201d\n\n32-ounce Ball mason jars\n\nTarget\n\nPrice: $10.35 for set of 12 jars, Target\n\nWhat to store: Fruit (strawberries, grapes, blueberries, raspberries)\n\n\u201cI love mason jars for fruit such as strawberries, blueberries and grapes,\" says Tunit. \"First of all , they are tall and narrow which doesn\u2019t take shelf space. They also seal tight for lasting freshness and they are glass, which is preferable to plastic.\u201d\n\nBINO Organizer Bin with Built-in Handle\n\nAmazon\n\nPrice: $9.99 per bin, Amazon\n\nWhat to store: Produce like peppers, yellow squash, tomatoes, small cucumbers\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of things I love about these bins: They\u2019re clear so you can see through them; They\u2019re wide, which is great because you can fit a lot of stuff in there; And you\u2019re freeing up the [produce drawer],\" says Tunit. \"They have handles so it's super easy to take them in and out.\"\n\nSliding Greek Yogurt Refrigerator Organizer\n\nAmazon\n\nPrice: $12.99 for a 2-pack, Amazon\n\nWhat to store: Greek Yogurt\n\n\u201cThis is another way to take things off of your shelves,\" says Tunit. \"It\u2019s super easy to install \u2014 it\u2019s literally just two little sticky tabs, take them off, and place it wherever you want in your fridge. Then you take your Greek yogurt and slide it in, and it hangs, which is genius; completely off your shelving space, which frees it up.\u201d\n\nWhitmor Adjustable Drawer Dividers\n\nAmazon\n\n$12.99 for a 2-pack, Amazon\n\nWhat to store: Grab-and-go snack foods like string cheese, fruit cups, pudding, apples (slice and separate into Ziploc baggies)\n\n\u201cPeople mostly use these for dressers and random drawers in their home, but I love it for a fridge,\u201d says Tunit, who recommends placing them inside your produce drawer. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is creating separation inside of an otherwise open drawer. When it's open and you start throwing things in, you\u2019re going to have everything mixed together. I like when everything is separated and categorized; it makes your life much easier.\u201d She suggests using this as a snack drawer, which is especially great for those with children. \u201cWhen a child goes in and wants to pack up a lunch bag in the morning, this is an awesome way to do it.\u201d\n\nLarge PRO-MART SMART DESIGN Refrigerator Pull Out Bin\n\nAmazon\n\nPrice: $17.99 per bin, Amazon\n\nWhat to store: Deli meats; cheese\n\n\u201cWhat the pullout bin does is give you extra drawer space that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have,\u201d says Tunit. \u201cThey are easy to clip on and off and you can get however many you think will fit. What I love about them is that they don\u2019t take up actual shelf space; they hang. So you\u2019re creating extra space without taking away any space.\u201d\n\nmDesign Stackable Food Storage Container Bin\n\nAmazon\n\nPrice: $11.90 per bin, Amazon\n\nWhat to store: To-go avocado packs, hummus, dressing packets, veggie dip\n\nTunit suggests using stackable bins because \u201cthey\u2019re narrow, not bulky, which is a space saver. They also have lids, so you\u2019re able to stack them. You can go three, four, however many levels up you want to go based on the size of your fridge.\" While she loves to use them for snack-sized containers, they are also another great way to store deli meats and cheese.\n\nBonus: storage ideas using products around your house\n\nThese storage ideas don\u2019t require buying special products. Instead re-purpose things you likely already have lying around your house:\n\nEgg carton: \u201cThis costs zero dollars, other than the eggs that come with it,\u201d says Tunit. One you've eaten all your eggs, simply cut off the lid of the carton and place it in the door of your fridge. \"Take condiments that are more narrow on top and flip them upside down,\" says Tunit, who adds that this is also a great trick to prevent those last drops from getting stuck at the bottom of your ketchup or salad dressing bottle.\n\n\u201cThis costs zero dollars, other than the eggs that come with it,\u201d says Tunit.

Ziploc baggies: \"I love using freezer bags in the actual fridge for lots of things,\" says Tunit. \"For one, it\u2019s the easiest thing to store marinated meats in. People often use a bowl, but that\u2019s less efficient and also forces you to use a lot more sauces. I also love transferring produce, fruits, cheeses, etc. to bags because I feel they stay fresher longer as well as keeping everything separated.\" She recommends labeling each bag to make the storage trick even more efficient.\n\n\"I love using freezer bags in the actual fridge for lots of things,\" says Tunit. \"For one, it\u2019s the easiest thing to store marinated meats in.

Witnesses said at a press conference following the electrocution that Zagorski was grinning at times but grimaced just before officials fired up the electricity.\n\nHe had dined on a final meal of pickled pig knuckles and tails, according to prison officials.\n\nWhile Tennessee normally puts inmates to death with lethal injection, Zagorski wants to die in the electric chair, claiming that 1,750 volts will be less painful than receiving a deadly cocktail of IV drugs.\n\nState law allows condemned prisoners, who committed their crimes before January 1999, to opt for electrocution.\n\nDeath row inmate Edmund Zagorski, 63. Jose Romero / Tennessee Department of Corrections / AFP - Getty Images\n\nZagorski, who murdered two men in 1983 in a drug deal gone wrong, had been set to die by lethal injection on Oct. 11 and the killer opted for electrocution. State authorities originally denied Zagorski\u2019s preference for electrocution, saying his request came too late.\n\nBut hours before the scheduled execution, Gov. Bill Haslam ordered a 10-day delay so the state could prepare the electric chair for Zagroski\u2019s use.\n\nThe last time Tennessee used the chair was in 2007 when the state executed 45-year-old Daryl Keith Holton, a Gulf War veteran who murdered his four children.\n\nGov. Haslam said this week he\u2019s confident the electric chair will function properly on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cI have a great deal of confidence in our Department of Correction folks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken with them regularly and they\u2019ve assured us (the chair is ready).\u201d\n\nZagorski was moved to a special holding cell near the death chamber on Tuesday morning, ahead of Thursday night\u2019s execution.\n\nThat\u2019s when an execution team sat Zagorski in the electric chair and wrap sponges soaked in saltwater around his ankles and head, to better conduct electricity.\n\nIn legal filings, Zagorki said death at the end of a syringe probably lasts \u201c10-18 minutes... in utter terror and agony.\" He claimed electrocution would be a shorter, less painful experience.\n\nZagorski was sentenced to death for the 1983 slayings of John Dotson and Jimmy Porter \u2014 two 35-year-old men who were planning to buy 100 pounds of marijuana from him.\n\nZagorski was the 1,485th execution carried out in the United States since capital punishment was re-started in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington D.C.\n\nBut he was only the eighth death penalty carried out in the Volunteer State since 1976, although there has already been one this year.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Danny Cevallos\n\nPresident Donald Trump attacked House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Wednesday for his opposition to a presidential executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of parents not legally in the United States.\n\n\"Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump doesn't seem to know a whole lot more about executive orders and how they relate to constitutional rights.\n\nFirst, it appears likely that birthright citizenship is a constitutional right. There are opponents who claim that it is not, or at least that it's an open question. Still, it's hard to argue with what appears to be clear language of the 14th Amendment Citizenship Clause, the history of reliance on this \"right\" and Supreme Court cases which appear to endorse \"jus soli\" \u2014 constitutionally granted citizenship by virtue of birth on American soil.\n\nIf birthright citizenship for children of parents not legally on American soil is enshrined in the 14th Amendment, it cannot be extricated by means of an executive order.\n\nArticle II, Section I of the Constitution provides that \"(t)he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\" And that's mostly it, as far as the Constitution goes. That hazy language establishes the president as the head of the executive branch, and renders him the boss of the heads of government agencies. It\u2019s also the source of power for the executive order or \"EO.\"\n\nWhile nebulous at times, there have been generally two kinds of EOs since President George Washington's time: \"documents with written instructions \u2026 to executive branch officials\" and \"written statements that communicate a presidential decision\u2026\"\n\nThe president's power includes \"general administrative control of those executing the laws,\" within the Executive Branch. Seeing that the laws are faithfully executed vests in the president the power to provide guidance and supervision to his subordinates. There are recognized limits, however: \"The President's power (under Article II, \u00a7 3) to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker.\" The \"executive order\" must ultimately be subordinate to statutes enacted by Congress.\n\nThe federal judiciary is also empowered to review the constitutionality of EOs. Indeed, it is the recognized duty of federal courts to preserve the Constitution's safeguards. In the past, the courts have invalidated executive orders that exceeded presidential power.\n\nIn 1952, for instance, the Supreme Court held that President Harry Truman's executive order that authorized his secretary of commerce to take over the country's steel mills was unconstitutional because the president acted without constitutional or statutory authority.\n\nAnd in 1996, the D.C. Court of Appeals concluded that an EO issued by President Bill Clinton was unlawful. Clinton's EO prevented employers performing under federal contracts from hiring strike breakers. The D.C. Circuit concluded this EO interfered with employers' right to hire their chosen workers.\n\nIf the president cannot legislate by EO, and if he cannot overturn congressional legislation by EO, then it follows that he surely cannot overturn an established constitutional right, even if he really, really disagrees that such a right exists.\n\nEven if the White House has a good faith belief that birthright citizenship is based on the public's, and the Supreme Court's, misinterpretation of the constitution, it's pretty clear the rest of the country has operated for hundreds of years in reliance on birthright citizenship.\n\nThe right predates the United States itself, as it derives from the English common law. At a minimum, an EO removing birthright citizenship would require demonstrating to the reviewing court (in the case that would be filed 30 seconds after the EO was issued) that the Citizenship Clause of the Constitution has been misunderstood for centuries, and is therefore inferior to an EO.\n\nAnd then the court would have to consider whether executive orders \u2014 which are below both federal statutes and the constitution on the legal hierarchy \u2014 could deign to remove a right considered constitutional for so long. It's just not likely, though there are opponents of birthright citizenship who say it's possible.\n\nTrump is convinced that he has the power to remove birthright citizenship by EO; he may issue such an order because of this firmly held belief.\n\nHowever, \"the separation of powers does not depend on the views of individual Presidents\u2026\" It depends on what the federal courts ultimately say about a particular presidential act, and whether it exceeds his authority. That is the constitutionally designed safeguard against the historically uncertain power of the executive order.\n\nDanny Cevallos is an MSNBC legal analyst.

But the unique challenges facing gay and bisexual men with prostate cancer have largely gone unaddressed.\n\nMen who have sex with men (MSM) are less likely to get regular prostate cancer screenings, and those who are diagnosed are less likely to have familial and social support, according to research cited by the National Institutes of Health. And if their health care provider is not culturally competent, gay and bisexual men are much less likely to understand how treatment will impact their quality of life.\n\n\"Those in large metropolitan areas may have the option of searching for an LGBT-welcoming provider, but most Americans don\u2019t have a choice about who treats them.\"\n\n\u201cMany LGBT people enter their cancer treatment wary,\u201d Liz Margolies of the National LGBT Cancer Network told NBC News. \u201cThose in large metropolitan areas may have the option of searching for an LGBT-welcoming provider, but most Americans don\u2019t have a choice about who treats them.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Margolies added, many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender patients go back in the closet when they begin cancer treatment. Even if they don\u2019t, providers often don\u2019t ask about patients' sexual behavior or identity, forcing them to bring the subject up themselves \u2014 sometimes again and again with each new specialist.\n\nSHAME AND INHIBITION\n\nWriter Perry Brass was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 2016. Three months later he had a radical prostatectomy, removing his entire prostate. Brass, then 68, was lucky: He lives in New York City, home to top-notch doctors and a medical community more informed about LGBTQ health.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a gay activist \u2014 and been out \u2014 so long that I took it for granted I could talk openly to my doctors,\u201d he told NBC News. But even he was unprepared for the side effects.\n\n\"Your sex drive can take a nosedive,\" Brass said, adding that prostate cancer can also lead to erectile dysfunction. \"You\u2019re experiencing ED, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not experiencing sexual attraction,\" he said.\n\nAbout 20 percent of patients treated with radiation experience irradiated bowels, which can make receptive anal sex painful or even impossible. Treatment can also affect penis size, ability to ejaculate, experience of orgasm and urinary continence during sex. Brass\u2019 said his sexual function was relatively good, but instead he struggled with incontinence for weeks \u2014 using as many as nine \u201cpads\u201d a day and staying within yards of a bathroom at all times.\n\nIf you\u2019re gay and you go to a urologist who hasn\u2019t dealt with gay men, they\u2019ll tell you, 'Bring your wife with you.'\"\n\nHe joined a prostate cancer support group specifically for gay and bisexual men at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, one of several organized by the national advocacy organization MaleCare.\n\nBeing with other queer men \u201callowed us to be very open about our feelings \u2014 and our sexuality \u2014 and to be empathetic with each other,\u201d Brass said. \u201cToo often gay men are erased in these [support] groups. They don\u2019t want to hear other men be vulnerable, and they don\u2019t want to hear about gay sex.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true in the doctor\u2019s office, too, Brass added.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re gay and you go to a urologist who hasn\u2019t dealt with gay men, they\u2019ll tell you, \u2018Bring your wife with you,\u2019\" he said. \"If you bring another man, they don\u2019t know what to do. They can\u2019t even breathe the words \u2018anal sex.\u2019 Talking to a man about it is just impossible.\u201d\n\nThat discomfort can spread to gay patients. \u201cTo go into a urologist office, you walk in with all this shame and inhibition,\u201d Brass lamented.\n\n\"A NEGLECTED AREA\"\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how many gay men have been diagnosed prostate cancer, because questions about sexuality are rarely included in research studies. \u201cThe medical community say, \u2018We don\u2019t want to ask older heterosexual men questions that might upset them,\u2019\" Simon Rosser, an LGBTQ health specialist and co-author of \"Gay and Bisexual Men Living With Prostate Cancer,\" told NBC News.\n\nSimon Rosser, PhD, MPH, is a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. University of Minnesota\n\nA professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Rosser has received a $3 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to put together the first comprehensive rehabilitation program specifically for gay and bisexual men with prostate cancer. But he\u2019s not just a researcher \u2014 he\u2019s a survivor himself, diagnosed last year at age 59. And he\u2019s keenly aware of how little information is available for men like him.\n\n\u201cWhen my husband was diagnosed and had a radical prostatectomy, we reached out for help,\" Rosser said. \"We were amazed to see how little was out there. I realized there were no studies, no research. It was a neglected area.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t institutionalized homophobia, Rosser stressed. \u201cOur efforts were focused on battling HIV, keeping young men alive. Frankly the older guys were secondary.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to cancer, urologists and oncologists \u2014 even wives \u2014 are laser-focused on survival, according to Rosser. But he said when it comes to male patients, \"studies show again and again that quality of life is equally important.\" And, he added, \"a big part of quality of life is urinary continence and sexual function.\u201d\n\nDoctors may also make a number of assumptions about patients, including about their family support system, their sexual orientation and their sexual interests.\n\n\u201cYour doctor might tell you you\u2019ll have an erection strong enough for intercourse, but anal penetration requires 33 percent more rigidity,\u201d Rosser said. He\u2019s heard men say their doctors \u201cneutered\u201d them. Others have said they\u2019d rather be dead. In all, 15 percent of all men who\u2019ve had a radical prostatectomy exhibit some kind of \u201ctreatment regret.\u201d For gay men, so long ignored by medicine, Rosser believes those rates are much higher.\n\n\u201c[A heterosexual man] with a postmenopausal wife who doesn\u2019t want sex anyway might just accept having a low libido,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut if your partner is another man, and his drive isn\u2019t diminished, it can be a real problem.\u201d\n\nRosser said the silence and shame surrounding the topic allows ugly myths to flourish \u2014 like that gay sex somehow \u201ccaused\u201d their cancer. \u201cGuys can feel guilty,\u201d Rosser said. \u201cOr, their partners may think on some level, they can \u2018catch\u2019 it.\u201d\n\nHe had some of those thoughts himself: \u201cI\u2019m a cyclist \u2014 did being in the saddle too much cause it? Did enjoying receptive anal sex?\u201d\n\nWithout good data, researchers can\u2019t get to the truth, Rosser stressed.\n\nRAISING AWARENESS\n\nThe first step is raising awareness: Launching in January, Rosser\u2019s groundbreaking program is bringing together a multidisciplinary team of top urologists, medical doctors, clinicians and sex therapists working with 450 candidates flagged by MaleCare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to do better,\u201d he said. \u201cGay men have a lot to offer the subject of prostate cancer. And we have studies that show outcomes are different for gay men: We have worse mental health, we have greater urinary problems, but our sexual outcomes are reliably better.\u201d\n\n\"Knowing that a third of my friends died from AIDS, I felt like I owed it to them to do everything I could to stay alive.\"\n\nThis spring, after his prostate specific antigens (PSA) started rising, Perry Brass underwent radiation treatment. The testosterone-killing hormones he had to take led to a kind of \u201cmale menopause.\u201d But he\u2019s in remission, something he credits to both his medical team and his husband, Hugh.\n\nThe survival rate for early-stage prostate cancer is 99 percent. Getting the disease, ironically, is something of a luxury for a gay men of Brass\u2019 age: Too many had their lives cut short by the AIDS epidemic long before they\u2019d typically be diagnosed (the average age for a prostate cancer diagnosis is 66).\n\nAfter the advent of lifesaving antiretroviral drugs in the mid-1990s, though, gay men are finally reaching their golden years.\n\n\u201cI am grateful that I\u2019m alive when so many of my friends aren\u2019t,\u201d Brass said. \u201cIt actually got me through the diagnosis. Knowing that a third of my friends died from AIDS, I felt like I owed it to them to do everything I could to stay alive.\u201d\n\nIt stole a generation, but the AIDS epidemic also taught gay men how to fight disease, how to ask questions and how to demand better treatment.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot we can teach in fighting prostate cancer,\u201d Rosser said. \u201cAbout expanding your idea of sex and sexuality, about maintaining a fit lifestyle as you get older. And, I think, as gay men, we bring a deep feeling of compassion, empathy and humor. We can laugh at it sometimes \u2014 and I do.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Paul A. Eisenstein\n\nDriving while using your cellphone is about to take on a whole new meaning, as Tesla starts to roll out an enhanced \"Summon\" feature that essentially allows drivers to operate their car via a phone app.\n\nThe electric carmaker will begin rolling out new software that will let its cars park themselves, without having a driver behind the wheel, according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk late Wednesday. A further upgrade to the \"Summon\" feature will eventually enable cars to read and follow parking signs, find their own parking space, and pull into it, Musk wrote.\n\nLimited auto-parking systems are now widely available in new models offered by a variety of mainstream and luxury manufacturers. They typically allow a motorist to find an appropriate spot, tap a button, and let the car steer into the parking space \u2014 though the driver may have to still operate the throttle and brakes.\n\nTesla\u2019s system would allow the driver to step out of the vehicle entirely. The first update to the current \u201cSummon\u201d feature would let a motorist essentially operate the vehicle from outside by holding a button on a smartphone as they guide it into a space.\n\n\u201cCar will drive to your phone location and follow you like a pet if you hold down Summon button on Tesla app,\u201d Musk tweeted, noting that the feature \u201cwill work on all cars made in past 2 years.\u201d This includes the new Model 3 sedan, and also recent versions of the Models S and X outfitted with Tesla\u2019s latest version of its Autopilot hardware.\n\nThis more advanced version is expected to be available \u201cby next year,\u201d Musk added.\n\nHowever, it's unclear whether anyone will legally be able to use the new features. With Congress still working on new autonomous vehicle guidelines, state regulators now call the shots and generally require a driver to remain behind the wheel whenever a vehicle is in motion. Individual states and, in some cases, municipalities, set rules for how a vehicle can operate. More than half of the states now permit some testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads. But, in virtually all cases, a licensed motorist must remain behind the wheel ready to take control in an emergency.\n\nCalifornia is one of a handful of states set to permit testing of fully driverless vehicles, with no one behind the wheel \u2014 and perhaps no driver controls in the vehicle to begin with. But such vehicles must be registered in those states and get specific authorization, even unique license plates. So, it is not clear if a vehicle operating in a public space, even a parking lot, would be legally allowed to park using the Tesla software.\n\nThe California-based automaker isn\u2019t the only manufacturer experimenting with so-called \u201cvalet\u201d parking technology. Others include Volvo and BMW. The German automaker has introduced it on several models though it can only operate in a few places, including Great Britain, where regulators in June approved new rules permitting cars to park without a driver behind the wheel.\n\nThe U.S. Congress is currently moving ahead on autonomous vehicle legislation. A preliminary bill has been approved by the House, but the Senate version remains unfinished and it is unclear if or when it might pass. But there is strong support for a federal bill that would expand the ability to test autonomous and fully driverless technologies. The final measure might authorize the use of a feature like the one Tesla is introducing.", "Watch Milwaukee police rescue woman, child from fiery car crash scene copied!\n\nMilwaukee police have released dash cam footage showing an officer pulling a toddler and passenger from a burning car after a chase that started as an attempted traffic stop.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Dartunorro Clark and Allan Smith\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered an 11th-hour policy speech just days before the critical midterm elections in which he called for hard-line immigration measures, doubling down on his pre-election messaging focused on a migrant caravan traveling through Mexico toward the U.S. southern border.\n\n\"At this very moment, large, well-organized caravans of migrants are marching toward our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. It's like an invasion,\" he said at the White House Thursday.\n\n\"Under this plan, illegal aliens will no longer get a free pass into the country by lodging meritless claims in seeking asylum,\" he added. \"...We will not allow our generosity to be abused by those who would break our laws.\"\n\nMost prominently, Trump said he plans to block immigrants from claiming asylum at any location other than a legal port of entry, and to hold them in detention until they have an asylum hearing. He said his administration is ready to hold both adults and their children together in \"tent cities\" along the border until those hearings take place.\n\nTrump insisted that both of those measures would be legal, though he provided little detail as to how the proposed changes could be implemented. Under current asylum law, immigrants are able to claim asylum anywhere inside the U.S. Immigrants often enter away from ports of entry which can suffer from large backlogs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Zadvydas v. Davis court decision means that adult immigrants cannot be detained for longer than six months unless they've committed another crime aside from illegal entry. The Reno v. Flores court decision limits the time that children can be held to 20 days.\n\nTrump made a number of misleading or false statements during the speech, including about the total number of undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. and about the progress of his wall along the nation's southern border.\n\nAs he has made immigration the central focus of his end-of-campaign messaging, Trump claimed that the migrant caravan traveling through Mexico \u2014 consisting of several thousand members \u2014 was seeking to invade the country. The president repeatedly called the group of migrants \"an invasion,\" and claimed no one was questioning that assertion, though many are.\n\nTrump also seemed to lay out the conditions where the thousands of troops to be deployed to the border would be able to fire at migrants seeking entry. Trump said that should any migrants \"throw rocks at our military, our military fights back.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Trump announced that the Pentagon would deploy 5,200 troops to deter a caravan of largely Honduran migrants at the southern border. On Wednesday, he suggested he could send as many as 15,000.\n\nHe made the issue of birthright citizenship a campaign issue this week with his quickly-disputed claim he could unilaterally eliminate the constitutionally-rooted right. The president also released an ad on Wednesday in which he, without evidence, linked the issue of immigration to a case in which a man was given the death penalty for killing two California police officers in 2014 \u2014 an incident which he has used in previous campaign ads.\n\nNBC News previously reported that the Trump administration is drafting an executive action that would make it far more difficult for Central Americans seeking asylum to gain entry at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe speech was expected to be given earlier this week but was postponed after a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue this past weekend, which killed 11 people.\n\nAfter speaking, the president departed for Columbia, Missouri for an evening campaign rally.", "DATELINE WEEKEND MYSTERY SNEAK PEEK: Obsession copied!\n\nA young Wisconsin college student with a passion for music is mysteriously found dead in her bed, but it's another woman's unbelievable courage that ultimately leads police to her killer.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Maggie Fox\n\nThe federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program released its final report Thursday on whether cellphones cause cancer. The final verdict: cellphone radiation may sometimes cause tumors in rats at high, continuous doses, but not in people.\n\nThe report leaves open the possibility that the kind of radiation produced by cellphones might have the potential to cause cancer, but it does not answer the question of how that might happen. The findings are unlikely to satisfy many people.\n\n\"The National Toxicology Program concluded there is clear evidence that male rats exposed to high levels of radio frequency radiation like that used in 2G and 3G cell phones developed cancerous heart tumors,\" the National Institutes of Health, parent agency of the NTP, said in a statement.\n\nThe final report doesn\u2019t change much that the researchers said in a preliminary report released in February. It found there is evidence that bathing rats in certain types of cellphone radiation for their entire lives might raise the risk of certain cancers in some of the rats.\n\nThe findings do not apply to people, they said.\n\n\u201cThe exposures used in our studies are not directly comparable to the exposures that humans typically experience when using a cellphone,\u201d the National Toxicology Program\u2019s John Bucher told reporters.\n\nThe NTP team did not expose the rats to the 4G frequencies now in common use.\n\nThe NTP gave its February report to experts for review, and Thursday\u2019s report reflects their comments. In general, Bucher said, they advised the NTP to strengthen its confidence in what was found.\n\nThe two most significant findings: Male rats bombarded with high doses of cellphone radiation had a higher risk of a type of rare cancer called a schwannoma in the nerves surrounding the heart. In February, the NTP said there was some evidence this happened but now says the evidence is clear.\n\nAnd they said there was now equivocal, or unclear, evidence that some female rats may develop similar tumors.\n\n\"In the brain of males, there were increased incidences of malignant glioma,\" the report added.\n\nIn a seeming contradiction, male rats exposed to cellphone signals lived longer than rats not exposed. They were especially less prone to a type of inflammatory kidney disease.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear why either thing might happen. The type of radiation that comes from cellphones is very different from the radiation that comes from gamma rays or nuclear energy. It can make tissue warm, but the rats were not given high enough doses to warm their tissues.\n\n\u201cWe saw evidence of DNA damage in some tissue of some animals,\u201d Bucher said. This will help guide scientists in targeting their future research.\n\nRat studies often find cancer links that never show up in people. And mice were not as strongly affected as rats seemed to be.\n\n\u201cWe do believe that the tumor responses that we have seen in our studies is real and they are associated with radiofrequency radiation,\u201d Bucher said.\n\nBut the bottom line of the report is that people should not worry that they will get cancer from using their cellphones.\n\n\u201cExposure to radiofrequency radiation has long been thought to be of no health concern as long as the energy level was low and didn\u2019t cause heating of the tissues,\u201d Bucher said.\n\n\u201cBased on our results, we are planning further studies to confirm that the experimental evidence continues to support this.\u201d\n\nThe $30 million, decades-long study has involved 3,000 rats and mice, some of which were irradiated while pregnant and the pups then also exposed to the cellphone radiation.\n\n\u201cIn our studies, rats and mice received radio frequency radiation across their whole bodies,\u201d Bucher said.\n\n\u201cBy contrast, people are mostly exposed in specific local tissues close to where they hold the phone. In addition, the exposure levels and durations in our studies were greater than what people experience.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it concurs that the research doesn\u2019t indicate people have any risk of cancer from using cellphones.\n\n\u201cWe agree that these findings should not be applied to human cell phone usage,\u201d the FDA\u2019s Dr. Jeffrey Shuren said in a statement.\n\nHe said the data from the study was confusing and contradictory. As scientists often say, more study is needed.\n\n\u201cAs scientists, we welcome new studies,\u201d Shuren said.\n\n\u201cAnimal studies like this one contribute to our discussions on this topic, but we must remember the study was not designed to test the safety of cell phone use in humans, so we cannot draw conclusions about the risks of cell phone use from it.\u201d\n\nThe American Cancer Society, which tracks the incidence of cancer, has noted that there has not been a noticeable increase in cancer types that might be associated with cellphone use.\n\n\u201cBased on our ongoing evaluation of this issue, the totality of the available scientific evidence continues to not support adverse health effects in humans caused by exposures at or under the current radiofrequency energy exposure limits,\u201d Shuren said.\n\n\u201cWe believe the existing safety limits for cell phones remain acceptable for protecting the public health.\u201d\n\nPeople can be exposed to radiofrequency radiation from cellphone towers, the report notes, but it\u2019s much more diffuse than what people get from using a cellphone.\n\nAs for Bucher, he says he\u2019s not a heavy cellphone user himself.\n\n\u201cI have become, based on these studies, a little more aware of my use of cellphones and if I make a short call I have absolutely no hesitation at all in picking up the phone and using it in a traditional manner,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m on a conference call for an hour or two I tend to think about using earbuds or some other way of increasing the distance between the cellphone and my body.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jane C. Timm\n\nThis midterm season, it's all about the Benjamins for President Trump. Vote for Republicans and reap the rewards, Trump has said at campaign rallies across the country.\n\n\"The decision is so clear all over the country, all over the country. Republicans are for lower taxes, less regulations and more economic freedom. And that's a good thing,\" Trump said in Wisconsin last week. \"The Democrats are for higher taxes, more regulation and more top-down government control.\"\n\nHe's even started promising another tax cut for voters, aimed at the middle class, after the midterms to continue the success of the last. But did the tax cut he signed a year ago actually help his voters as he said it would?\n\nLet's take a look at Trump's midterm pitch, his tax cut promises and the facts.\n\n1. Claim: Tax cuts, GOP policies created lots of jobs\n\nPartially true. Trump routinely ties jobs to his tax cuts on the campaign trail, criticizing Democrats by arguing that the Republican Party is about \"jobs not mobs.\" And while the economy is certainly booming and unemployment is dropping, economists agree that started long before Trump's election; his policies, they say, have helped give it an added boost.\n\nThe Tax Foundation, an independent think tank, estimated the Trump/GOP tax bill created a relatively modest 215,000 jobs this year. Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, said similar gains are expected to continue for five to seven years.\n\nHoward Gleckman, a senior fellow at the independent think tank Tax Policy Center, said job gains were steady with the Obama administration's trends, but added that it's possible losses stemming from Trump's tariffs war could erase job gains from the tax cuts.\n\n2. Claim: The stock market boosted your retirement\n\nIf you've got a retirement plan, true. Trump has been quick to tout the stock market's gains as something that's good for his voters.\n\n\"Think of what will happen to your now beautiful 401-k's!\" Trump tweeted recently.\n\nBut nearly half of Americans may not have a retirement plan at all. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an estimated 54 percent of people have some kind of workplace retirement plan, like a 401(k) or a pension that are typically at least partially invested in the market.\n\nSome people are reaping the benefits of an elevated stock market, though the daily ups Trump tweets about \u2014 and the downs he often omits \u2014 aren't typically affecting most Americans, who may not have significant market holdings outside of their retirement plans. The vast majority of stock is held by a small number of people: 84 percent of all stock is owned by the 10 percent richest Americans, according to a 2017 study.\n\n3. Claim: Growth will pay for the tax cuts\n\nNope. As a candidate and later as president, Trump insisted that enormous growth would pay for the cuts. Already, growth has fallen short of the president's goals. The Office of Management and Budget said last month that they'd revised their forecasts to account for a deficit that's going to top a trillion dollars next year.\n\nThis is in part because corporations are spending a significant amount of their tax savings on buying back their own stock, benefiting shareholders.\n\n\"It wasn't a surprise to any of us,\" Gleckman said. \"Remember the context that businesses got this big tax cut, this windfall at a time when they were hanging on to an enormous amount of capital. Had they seen the need to make big long-term investments, they already had the money to do it.\"\n\nConservatives like Heritage Foundation Policy Analyst Adam Michel, however, argue the corporate buy backs are just temporary.\n\n\"Workers are going get the long-term benefit as companies adjust to the newer tax regime and invest,\" he told NBC News.\n\n4. Claim: 90 percent of Americans got a tax cut, bonuses for millions\n\nTrue. Immediately after the tax cut, Trump and his allies touted the millions of Americans who would see tax reductions, bonuses and other financial perks. And while year-end tax withholding data is not yet available, according to the Treasury, economists agree that the vast majority of Americans did receive tax cuts.\n\nMillions also got bonuses of some kind. A group that supported the tax cuts, Americans for Tax Reform, gathered 748 examples of \"good news\" stemming from the tax cuts and the group told NBC News this week that utility bill cuts affected at least 130 million accounts.\n\nStill, economists are quick to note, the bonuses are short-lived and argue they were publicity moves to curry presidential favor.\n\n\"That was more of a marketing thing and more of a communications thing from companies than the actual theoretical thing from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" Pomerleau said.\n\n5. Claim: Tax cuts helped working families\n\nNot as much as they helped corporations. \"We have eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations and passed a massive tax cut for working families,\" Trump said in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week.\n\nYes, working families likely did get a tax cut, but the biggest beneficiaries of the tax bill are corporations, who have lasting cuts while individual tax cuts expire in 2025.\n\n\"And we will soon follow up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle class,\u201d the president continued.\n\nIt's perhaps telling that Trump is promising another tax cut for middle-class voters, because while the majority of Americans did see a tax reduction, most don't feel like they did: A CNBC poll in March found that just 32 percent of the public felt like they were seeing more in their paychecks.\n\nFundamentally, economists say, the tax cuts were significant for corporations and modest for individuals. While conservatives hope those boons will trickle down to lower income Americans, that's yet to happen.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Phil Scott is \"a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\" who doesn't live up to the independent image he projects, citing his vetoes of bills to raise the minimum wage and enact paid family leave, and alleged outsourcing of political dirty work to others.\n\nThe only problem with that message may be getting her fellow Democrats to listen. In a state that voted for Hillary Clinton by an almost 2-to-1 margin, a recent poll shows the Republican incumbent leading Hallquist 42 percent to 28 percent, with 22 percent undecided.\n\n\"Phil is distancing himself from the Republican Party because he won't get elected if he gets tied to the Republican Party, but he's following the exact same tactics as the Republican Party,\" Hallquist said. \"That's what I keep telling folks \u2014 stop listening to his words and look what he\u2019s doing.\"\n\nEven if the \"blue wave\" materializes on Election Day, it appears unlikely to wash out popular GOP governors in some of the bluest states in the country. That's because they have effectively used both their overwhelmingly Democratic legislatures and President Donald Trump as foils.\n\nPolitical handicappers now give Democrats a better chance at winning governor's races in Oklahoma, South Dakota and Georgia than they do in states like Vermont, Massachusetts and Maryland.\n\n\"Republicans cracked the formula for winning in and successfully governing blue states,\" said Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the Cook Political Report.\n\nBut Vermont may end up with one of the oddest results anywhere Tuesday night by simultaneously re-electing its Republican governor and a self-described Democratic socialist senator in Bernie Sanders with many voters likely opting for both.\n\nAnd a state that prides itself on being the first to enact civil unions and gay marriage by legislation might miss a chance to make the next chapter of LGBTQ history after Hallquist struggled to even raise enough money to run a TV ad.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Allan Smith\n\nBillionaire media mogul Oprah Winfrey, in the first of several campaign stops to boost Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams on Thursday, knocked down rumors of a potential run for office and told the cheering crowd they are poised \"on the precipice of a historic election.\"\n\n\"I want to tell you...no one paid for me to come here. No one asked me to come here,\" Winfrey said at a rally in Marietta, adding that she is both an independent woman, and a registered political independent. \"I came for myself and I approve this message.\"\n\nWinfrey, who took the stage to booming applause, said she wanted to come to Georgia to support Abrams because she saw how Abrams is \"handling herself\" amid an onslaught of \"haters.\"\n\n\"You keep it coming on,\" Winfrey said, adding that Abrams keeps \"standing strong for the values that matter to me and the values that matter to Georgians all over this state.\"\n\nWinfrey added that \"if you're woke just a little bit, you know everyone is not treated equally.\" She praised Abrams as someone who will \"serve the underserved\" if elected as Georgia\u2019s first female African-American governor.\n\nWinfrey joined Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia state House, at a second rally in Decatur later in the day. She also went door to door as part of her visit, just days before one of the nation's tightest elections reaches the finish line.\n\nDuring the first campaign event, Winfrey addressed the rumors that she was interested in a possible 2020 presidential bid, saying she was there solely to boost Abrams and wasn't interested in a run for office herself.\n\n\"I'm not trying to test any waters,\" Winfrey said.\n\nSoon after Winfrey wrapped up speaking to the crowd, Abrams took the stage for a roundtable discussion. As the two were sitting down, the crowd started chanting: \"You get a vote! And you get a vote! And you get a vote!\"\n\nThe chant was a play on an iconic moment from her daytime TV show, where she told her audience: \"You get a car! You get a car!\"\n\nWhile Winfrey insisted the trip was not one where she intended to highlight any of her own political abilities, her speech was somewhat of a combination of a campaign speech and a trip to church. Though she did check her notes a couple of times, most of Winfrey's speech appeared off-the-cuff.\n\nIn announcing Winfrey's appearance on Wednesday, Abrams said the media mogul \"has inspired so many of us though the years with her unparalleled ability to form real connections and strengthen the bonds of family and community.\"\n\n\"I am honored to have Oprah join me for uplifting and honest conversations with voters about the clear choice before us in this election and the boundless potential of Georgians,\" Abrams told NBC News in a statement.\n\nAbrams is going toe-to-toe with Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp in one of the nation's most hotly contested races. Last week, an NBC News/Marist poll found that the race is essentially tied, with likely voters favoring Kemp by a 49 percent to 47 percent spread, a number within the poll's margin of error. Among registered voters, the two candidates are tied at 47 percent.\n\nThe battle between Abrams and Kemp has featured a number of controversies. The latest one bubbled to the surface on Wednesday after the secretary of state backed out of the final scheduled gubernatorial debate so that he could campaign alongside President Donald Trump on Sunday, who is paying Georgia a visit.\n\nAfter backing out of the WSB-TV debate, Kemp offered to debate at a new time \u2014 7:30 p.m. on Monday, just hours before Election Day, but Abrams did not agree to the new terms. That led to Kemp's campaign trying to shift blame to Abrams, accusing her of \"ducking Georgia voters.\"\n\nThe race's most prominent back-and-forth involves Kemp's current role as the state's top election official. That controversy centers on Kemp purging tens of thousands of voters, most of whom are black, from voter rolls ahead of next week's election.

Simon Dawson / Reuters file\n\nBanks, a pugnacious admirer and associate of President Donald Trump, was the main bankroller of Leave.EU, a grassroots entity separate from the official Vote Leave campaign.\n\nThe insurance magnate has faced questions over his personal wealth and has admitted repeated meetings with Russia\u2019s ambassador to Britain.\n\nThe Electoral Commission, which can impose civil sanctions for breaches of election rules, said it had \u201creasonable grounds to suspect a number of criminal offences\u201d and referred the matter to the NCA.\n\nIn particular, it said, there were reasonable grounds to suspect that Banks was not the true source of $10.3 million reported as loans to pro-Brexit campaign groups.\n\nBritish electoral campaigns are barred from taking money from overseas-based individuals or businesses.\n\nBanks has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He tweeted from a fishing vacation in Bermuda that he was \"pleased\" at the latest news, saying: \"I am confident that a full and frank investigation will finally put and end to the ludicrous allegations.\"\n\nIn the June 2016 referendum, 17.4 million votes, or 51.9 percent of votes cast, backed leaving the European Union while 16.1 million votes, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying, a result that defied opinion polls.\n\nBritain will leave the 28-nation customs and trading bloc on March 29, although the divorce process is mired in chaos amid stalled negotiations between London and Brussels.\n\nSuspicions that the referendum may have been illegally influenced have added weight to calls for a second vote or for Brexit to be abandoned altogether.\n\nBanks is a close ally of anti-immigration Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, and the pair were among the first foreign political figures to visit Trump after his 2016 election victory.\n\nThey are both reportedly of interest to special counsel Robert Mueller in his inquiry into links between Trump and Russia.\n\nBanks was in regular contact with Russian officials between 2015 and 2017 and was offered a business deal involving Russian gold mines, according to emails revealed earlier this year by the co-author of his book, \u201cThe Bad Boys of Brexit.\u201d\n\nBanks responded at the time: \"I had two boozy lunches with the Russian ambassador and another cup of tea with him.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The National Rifle Association \u2014 long seen as a kingmaker in Republican politics \u2014 is taking a lower profile in this year's high-stakes midterm campaign, a sign of the shifting dynamics of the gun debate as the GOP fights to maintain its grip on Congress.\n\nThe NRA has put $11 million into midterm races this year \u2014 less than half what it spent four years ago in an election that gave Republicans full control of Congress. This year's totals are also far below the $54 million the group spent in 2016 on both the presidential and congressional races.\n\nThe shift comes as spending to support tougher gun control measures has surged. Everytown for Gun Safety, a group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pledged $30 million for this year's election and has continued to put new money into competitive races in the final days. A political action committee formed by Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman wounded in a shooting, is spending nearly $5 million.\n\nIt's the first time under current campaign finance laws that the NRA might be outspent by gun control groups, though the organization often ramps up spending late in the campaign. That money won't show up in federal financial reports until after Election Day.\n\nIt all underscores a changing political landscape on guns after a series of election year mass shootings, including the February massacre at a Parkland, Florida, high school that left 17 people dead, and Saturday's deadly attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\n\"The politics of guns has changed,\" said Jim Kessler, the senior vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist think tank. \"The groups supporting more gun safety restrictions are smarter than in the past and have more resources, both in terms of people and money, than in the past.\"\n\nWith polls showing that the majority of Americans now support at least some tightening of gun laws, the issue is no longer taboo in swing districts, particularly the suburban areas that could determine which party controls the House next year. Everytown and Giffords' group are on the air in competitive districts in Texas, Virginia, Kansas and elsewhere.\n\nAfter the Pittsburgh shooting, a Bloomberg aide said Everytown bought another $700,000 in advertisements aimed at ousting Rep. Mike Coffman, a vulnerable Republican who represents a suburban Denver district \u2014 a significant sum to spend on a single House race in one week.\n\nThe group has also spent about $4 million in the Atlanta suburbs to back Democrat and gun control advocate Lucy McBath, whose son was shot and killed in 2012.\n\nDespite the public polling, there are no guarantees that sending more pro-gun-control lawmakers to Washington would result in tougher legislation. Modest measures have repeatedly been blocked in Congress, even as Americans have grown more supportive of steps like banning assault weapons and tightening background checks.\n\nBloomberg, who is weighing a run for president as a Democrat in 2020, promises to keep up the pressure on lawmakers and candidates he's backing if they end up on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"I've put an awful lot of my money and an awful lot of my time into this,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"I'm not going to forget it. I'm not going to walk away.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The nice thing about the House, it may be a stupidly designed system, but if they don't do what they said they were going to do, you get another crack at deciding to support them or somebody else two years from now.\"\n\nAn NRA spokeswoman would not comment on the group's election spending compared to organizations pushing for stricter gun laws.\n\nBloomberg, who is spending $120 million on the midterms, has helped pro-gun control groups level a playing field long dominated by the NRA.\n\nThe organization was riding high after the 2016 election, with a strong supporter in the White House and Republicans in charge of both the House and Senate.\n\nBut 2018 has proved to be a tumultuous year for the NRA. The group has faced boycotts from parts of corporate America in the wake of mass shootings, as well as an investigation into what federal authorities allege were covert Russian agents seeking to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump by courting NRA officials and funneling money through the group.\n\nPublicly, the NRA has portrayed itself as being in financial distress because of deep-pocketed liberal opposition to guns and what it calls the mainstream media \"spewing toxic lies\" about the group. Over the summer, the organization raised its annual dues fees from $40 to $45 \u2014 the second increase in two years.\n\nNRA watchers dismiss the notion that the organization is in trouble and say it's more of a ploy to energize its ardent supporters, which in turn could help bring in more donations.\n\n\"It's in the NRA's interests to exaggerate how much trouble it's in,\" said Robert J. Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland and an expert on guns and the Second Amendment.\n\nIndeed, the group's political fundraising is up this year compared to the last midterm election. According to data provided by an NRA official, the group's Political Victory Fund has raised more than $12 million this year compared to nearly $11 million at this same point in the 2014 midterms.\n\nWhile the NRA is not pumping the same levels of money into this year's elections, it still has much at its disposal to try to sway campaigns: its NRATV media arm, social media and an ability to mobilize its millions of members to get them to the polls.\n\nThe NRA's membership rolls and finances are not public, but the organization has said it has about 6 million in its ranks. Those who closely watch the group believe its membership is closer to 4 million.\n\nBoth the NRA and groups such as Everytown can also quietly influence elections with money that doesn't have to be reported in publicly available campaign finance reports.\n\nPane reported from Boise, Idaho.

A twin mattress starts at $129.99, while the thickest king mattress starts at $239.99. Earlier this week, TJI Research spotted a new, premium offering from Rivet, a millennial-focused furniture brand owned by Amazon.\n\nThose mattresses range from $449 to $624.99, and the site currently only list reviews from people who received a free product. Like its competitors, including Casper and Tuft & Needle, the Rivet mattresses come with a 100-night free trial.\n\nThe mattresses are also significantly cheaper. Casper\u2019s king mattress sells for $1,195 on Amazon. A king mattress from Tuft & Needle is listed for $750 on Amazon.\n\n\u201cLooking at what Amazon is doing. It's a terrifying prospect, given what they have done to other categories,\u201d said Matt Sargent, senior vice president of retail at Magid, a research firm.\n\n\"They can go into a category and be aggressively priced, because at the end of the day, they are looking for that full circle engagement,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cThey can afford to not make the margins the others are working on.\"\n\nThe global mattress market was valued at $27 billion last year and is predicted to be worth $43 billion by 2024, according to a report from Zion Market Research.\n\nWalmart, Amazon\u2019s chief competitor, launched its Allswell mattress brand earlier this year, with mattresses selling for between $195 and $745, according to its website.\n\nThe days of lying on a bed in a mattress store are dwindling, as more people turn to online reviews to make their purchasing decisions. Amazon\u2019s entry into the market comes as Mattress Firm, the largest brick-and-mortar mattress store, filed for bankruptcy last month.\n\n\"Amazon is a company with huge aspirations but at the same time realizes that its lifeblood is its brand name merchandise,\" said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \"Retailers have created house brands for years \u2014 so no one should be surprised.\"\n\nDespite the \u201cterrifying\u201d prospect of brands waking up to discover Amazon is now a competitor, Sargent said established online mattress companies have something Amazon doesn\u2019t: Specialization.\n\n\u201cWhen you get to an item like a mattress where there is very low frequency, it's heavily used, people tend to want to go with a brand that is specialized in that category,\u201d said Sargent. Casper and Tuft & Needle also both offer physical locations, where people who aren\u2019t sold by online reviews can come in and try out the product.\n\nPhilip Krim, CEO and co-founder of Casper, told NBC News in a statement that the company is \"as imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, we are certainly flattered.\"\n\n\"We appreciate Amazon helping more people realize that buying a bed online is a smart move, and Amazon will continue to be a great distribution partner for Casper,\" he said. \"Fortunately, Casper is often imitated but never duplicated.\"\n\nMattresses are just the latest private label product launched by Amazon.\n\nAmazon has launched more than 130 brands, according to TJI Research, ranging from furniture to pet food to lingerie. While Amazon\u2019s reputation as the \u201ceverything store\u201d has transformed it into a trillion-dollar global powerhouse, regulators have expressed concern about whether Amazon has an unfair advantage.\n\nIn September, the European Commission opened a preliminary investigation into whether the company uses merchant data to its advantage when selling against competitors on the site. Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said at a September news conference that the commission wanted to find out whether Amazon used data from merchants to decide \u201cWhat is the new big thing, what it is that people want, what kind of offers do they like to receive, what makes them buy things?\u201d\n\nEuropean regulators have been aggressively pursuing cases against American technology giants. Google was fined $5 billion earlier this year for promoting its own apps on its free Android platform. Last December, a European Commission investigation alleged Apple benefited from unfair tax loopholes in Ireland and ordered the world\u2019s most valuable company to pay Ireland the equivalent of $15.4 billion \u2014 even though Irish authorities said they would appeal.\n\nAmazon did not immediately return a request for comment.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Brandy Zadrozny\n\nJacob Wohl, a former hedge fund manager turned pro-Trump conspiracy peddler, was a small-time but persistent figure on the far-right for the past two years. Then came the revelation of his apparent involvement as a central character in a bizarre plot to smear special counsel Robert Mueller. Now the FBI has been asked to investigate the alleged scheme, and Wohl may achieve the notoriety he\u2019s been chasing for years.\n\nThe details of that plot to discredit Mueller were revealed on Tuesday, when journalists reported receiving suspicious emails from a woman claiming she had been offered money to fabricate accusations of sexual misconduct against the special prosecutor investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. NBC News traced a document outlining the Mueller allegations to a company whose website and telephone were registered to Wohl and his family.\n\nWohl, a self-described \u201cTrumpenomics expert,\u201d was perhaps best known on the internet for his dispatches from \u201chipster coffee shops\u201d where Democrats supposedly secretly disclosed their love for the president. But as a writer on conspiracy sites, with 178,000 Twitter followers along for the ride, Wohl also earned a place among President Donald Trump\u2019s most ardent and trolly online defenders. He was the first to tease that allegations were coming against Mueller, tweeting early Tuesday: \u201cSeveral media sources tell me that a scandalous story about Mueller is breaking tomorrow. Should be interesting. Stay tuned!\"\n\nThose allegations, called \u201cvery credible,\u201d by Wohl, were dropped hours later in a dossier on Gateway Pundit, a far-right, often inaccurate website for which Wohl writes. That dossier seems to have been written by Surefire Intelligence \u2014 the company tagline for the self-described \u201cprivate intel agency\u201d appears on the header of each page, and at least one woman has come forward with an email signed by an agent of Surefire, asking her for allegations against Mueller in exchange for money.\n\nWohl denied any connection to Surefire Intelligence, telling NBC News: \u201cI don't have any involvement in any investigations of any kind. I'm not quite that cool.\u201d But Surefire Intelligence is linked to Wohl in numerous ways, including domain records and a company phone that redirects to a number registered to Wohl\u2019s mother.\n\nAfter news hit of Wohl\u2019s apparent connection to Surefire, Gateway Pundit pulled the dossier and replaced the text with a statement that founder Jim Hoft would be investigating both the dossier and Wohl\u2019s involvement.\n\nWohl posted that he\u2019s appearing at a press conference Thursday at a Holiday Inn in Washington, where conspiracy theorists have pledged to reveal Mueller\u2019s supposed victims.\n\nFINANCIAL SCHEMES AND BIKINI MODELS\n\nWohl, 20, has a history of schemes. He was once billed as a teenage financial guru, but his penchant for lying \u2014 about his success and credentials \u2014 cut his investment career short and attracted investigations by government and industry regulators.\n\nWohl got his first taste of fame at 17, in a local news profile of his hedge fund. Calling him the \u201cWohl of Wall Street,\u201d the spot gave Wohl publicity for Wohl Capital, a fund that he claimed had grown to 20 investors \u2014 students, parents, grandparents and teachers \u2014 and offered returns of over 22 percent.\n\nBy 2016, Wohl had shut down the hedge fund, and instead of college, he was running two new projects from Los Angeles. One was Montgomery Assets, which Wohl claimed invested in equity, fixed income and commodity markets, and started with \u201cseed money from a Chinese family office.\u201d The other was NeX Capital Management, a commodity trading adviser.\n\nWohl ran his businesses in an unorthodox way, attracting clients in part with bikini models he had found on Craigslist and Backpage. An ex-employee described the practice to an investor news website and it was documented in real time with screenshots posted by Twitter users who made it a hobby to follow Wohl\u2019s activities.\n\n\u201cWe need models for promo modeling events including conferences, trade shows, seminars, etc.,\u201d read one Orange County, California, Craigslist ad viewed by NBC News. \u201cWe also have other modeling opportunities including bikini modeling and fashion modeling if you fit the type for that sort of modeling.\u201d\n\nWohl blamed the posts on \u201ctrolls of mine in 2016,\u201d whom he \u201cimmediately reported\u201d to the FBI, he told The Daily Beast.\n\nIn August 2016, Wohl announced that Montgomery Assets was \u201cacquiring\u201d Hollywood talent manager Trousdale Consultants, a company with no footprint, no website and no record with California\u2019s business registry, until Wohl\u2019s announcement. Following the partnership, Wohl used the new arm of his company to place Los Angeles Craigslist ads for \u201cInstagram models\u201d and \u201ccollege hotties.\u201d\n\nWhile Wohl was posting YouTube videos and writing press releases alleging great success, his clients were complaining to regulators. In one allegation, which prompted an investigation by the National Futures Association, an organization that self-regulates the futures industry, a client claimed that Wohl told him his $75,000 investment had grown, but only provided $44,000 when he asked to cash out of the fund. Wohl claimed the fund had lost money, but examiners noted in their report that the account overall had made a profit, which was then moved to another fund, established in the name of Wohl\u2019s mother.\n\nAccording to their report, Wohl evaded investigators and hid from them when they knocked on his door. Wohl\u2019s father, David Wohl, an attorney and a recurring guest on Fox News programs, threatened to have the regulators charged with harassment. The association did, however, find Wohl to be \u201cunbalanced\u201d in his presentation of profit risks to clients and said he had misled investors by claiming to have been trading since he was 9 years old. In 2017, the National Futures Association banned Wohl for life.\n\nThat same year, an investigation by the Arizona Corporation Commission concluded that Wohl had defrauded investors. He was ordered to cease and desist in the violation of securities laws, and pay about $38,000 in restitution and fines, according to commission documents obtained by NBC News. As part of the settlement, he neither admitted nor denied the findings. In 2017, Wohl\u2019s lawyer told the commission that the first payment of $16,000 would not be made on time. \u201cUltimately, we do not have the funds,\u201d Wohl\u2019s lawyer said. In January, Wohl\u2019s case was referred to the state\u2019s attorney general for collections, according to commission documents. In March, Arizona Superior Court entered a judgement against Wohl for nonpayment.\n\nSPREADING CONSPIRACY THEORIES\n\nWohl\u2019s history with financial regulators and unhappy clients might have hurt someone else\u2019s career prospects. But in a post-fact era, Wohl\u2019s support of Trump, coupled with his devotion to conspiracies and tireless self-promotion on social media, has fueled his rise in online far-right circles.\n\nIn February 2016, Wohl appeared on Dr. Drew\u2019s HLN show as a Trump fan and critic of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. By September, he was shaking hands with then-candidate Trump.\n\nWhen Trump was elected, Wohl directed all of his focus on politics. Trump, Wohl says, is \u201cthe greatest president of all time,\u201d and his greatest accomplishment, according to Wohl, is \u201cblowing up the cancer known as political correctness.\u201d\n\nWohl is often one of the first and most flattering to reply to Trump\u2019s tweets. In the summer of 2017, Trump retweeted Wohl twice.\n\nIn February, Wohl launched The Washington Reporter, a conservative news website and home for his new political podcast, which he called \u201cOffended America.\u201d Wohl copied word for word the code of ethics for his new site from the watchdog journalism outlet Propublica, and early stories on the site included \u201cHillary Clinton Is Still Paying Private Spies to Dig Up Dirt on Trump,\u201d and \u201cAs Mueller\u2019s Witch-Hunt Continues, Links to Soros Emerge.\u201d\n\nDomain records show the site used to belong to Malia Zimmerman, the Fox News reporter sued this year by the parents of Seth Rich, the Democratic aide whose murder was seized on by conspiracy theorists, including Wohl. (The case was dismissed.)\n\nWohl has adopted and amplified nearly every prominent conspiracy theory to arise in the last year. He has claimed that Stormy Daniels cheated a polygraph examination, billionaire George Soros paid marchers to protest and recent mail bombs sent to prominent Democrats were \u201cfalse flags\u201d meant to swing the midterms.\n\nIn June, Wohl began writing for The Gateway Pundit. By August, Wohl\u2019s website was down and he had stopped releasing new episodes of his podcast.\n\nNow, faced with allegations that he created a fake intelligence company to fabricate harassment accusations against Mueller, Wohl seems to be digging in with a new conspiracy theory, invented just for him.\n\n\u201cSomeone inside Mueller\u2019s office likely sent out the hoax email claiming to be a woman offered payment to make an accusation against Mueller!\u201d Wohl tweeted Wednesday. \u201cThey know that Mueller\u2019s real victims are coming forward!

It's gritty and a smokier type of texture and flavor. The stone-grinding is unique,\" said Ung, who recently moved from Houston to Boston with Rodriguez.\n\nAn assortment of Taza chocolate bars Sarah Betancourt\n\nBoy, is the flavor intense. Most dark chocolates, which are very bitter, are over 35% cacao. Taza's is a lot more; there's nothing subtle about it. In fact, their most popular chocolate, \"Wicked Dark,\" is 95% cacao. Whether it's the sandy texture of the treat or the occasional bitter darkness of its intense cacao mixture, no one can walk away from a bite without having a strong impression. It has a rave following.\n\nThe product, now found in over 40 states, owes its unique aesthetic and making to an ancient Mexican tradition of stone grinding the cacao beans to make the chocolate.\n\nTaza founder Alex Whitmore was inspired when he first experienced the different style of chocolate while visiting Oaxaca, Mexico in 2004. The area is known for chocolate making since the Olmec, who came before the Mayans, and it's still famous for it.\n\nWhitmore apprenticed a molinero (grinder) to learn how to hand-carve the granite mill stones used to grind the cacao beans. In 2005, he launched Taza with his wife Kathleen Fulton, and has since sourced cacao from Latin America, and more recently, Africa.\n\nA grinding stone to make chocolate the ancient Mexican way, a technique used by Taza Chocolate. Sarah Betancourt / NBC News\n\nThis past Sunday, the company celebrated its eighth D\u00eda de Los Muertos Block party outside its factory in Somerville, Massachusetts to honor the Mexican holiday and the roots of its chocolate-making practices.\n\n\"We want to celebrate Day of the Dead, and highlight the inspiration,\" said Whitmore. \"We love the Mexican chocolate-making tradition, and have had a lot of people who work here who are Mexican or Meso-American.\"\n\nWhitmore elaborated on the history of foods indigenous to Latin America, including cacao, chiles, tomatoes and potatoes.\n\n\"There are so many things we take for granted as a part of European cuisine, including chocolate,\" Whitmore told NBC News.\n\nThe name Taza means \"cup\" in Spanish. \"Literally, a cup of chocolate, like how it's done down there,\" Whitmore said, referring to the ancient Mexican tradition of drinking the ground and melted chocolate.\n\nPart of Taza's loyalty to chocolate's Latin American and small farming roots comes in play through their trade practices; the company has established a third-party Direct Trade Cacao Certification program. This means managers maintain direct relationships with cacao producers, most of which have tiny farms, in order to make sure they're following safe and fair labor and environmental practices, paying workers decent wages and maintaining high-quality cacao.\n\nOne of those traders is Gualberto Acebey from \u00d6KO Caribe, a cooperative of over 180 small cacao farms in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\"They're small producers, and Taza is able to give us a good price for the chocolate so we can pay the 180 farmers,\" said Acebey.\n\nAcebey recently visited Somerville for a second time to attend a business conference at Harvard University and give a presentation, along with Taza, at the New England Chocolate Festival.\n\n\"There's been a lot of growth, and it's been helpful to us as cacao traders to be part of that growth,\" said Acebey. Transparency in the cacao business is important to the cooperative and to supporting fair labor practices, because many cacao traders often skip rules and regulations, said Acebey.\n\nTaza pays at least $500 above market price for cacao in order to support its direct trade program, a 15 to 20 percent premium.\n\nFrom farm, to chocolate bar\n\nThe cacao from Acabey's province in the Dominican Republic, El Cibao, is known for its cherry, ripe mango, and lemony tones. It's the base bean for over 50% of Taza's chocolates. The region has about 35,000 cacao farming families who are growing the beans in rich, fertile soil during two harvest seasons.\n\nTo harvest, farmers cut open the pods, pulled from the cacao tree, and remove fruit-covered seeds (commonly referred to as beans), and collect them in buckets to be collected by \u00d6KO Caribe.\n\nOnce transported to the company's processing facility, the organic cacao beans undergo six days of fermentation in wooden boxes followed by a week of solar drying, give or take a day based on the weather.\n\nJesse Last, Taza's sourcing manager, stands in front of bagged cacao beans that come from small farms in different countries, including the Dominican Republic. Sarah Betancourt\n\nJesse Last, Taza's sourcing manager, travels to cacao farms, and was very excited to share photos of the fruit and the families he met in his travels.\n\n\"We have a lot of requirements,\" he said. \"We have a great network of cacao contacts in countries where it's grown. I love making the trips.\"\n\nIt typically takes two to four years after a tree is planted before it starts growing pods.\n\n\"You can just go up to the trees, and grab this beautiful pod. They're orange, green, red, and football sized.\" The cacao producers work with Taza to determine how long they should leave the beans drying in the sun, a factor that can significantly change the chocolate's ultimate flavor, according to Last.\n\nBack at the Dia de los Muertos event, Ung, who described himself as \"passionate about food,\" said he would like to see Taza talk even more with the community about their chocolate-making roots in Mexico and their use of traditional practices.\n\nRodriguez grew up in Texas, but her family owns a small cacao farm in southern Mexico and takes part of the cacao trade.\n\n\"I'm a harsh critic when consuming Latin American food because I've been around it so much,\" she said. \"I think the chocolate is an acquired taste, and Taza does it well.\"\n\nVyvy Dao smells Taza chocolate with a hint of chili peppers. Sarah Betancourt / NBC News\n\nOn the D\u00eda de los Muertos celebration, she said, \"As an arts educator, I'm interested in observing cultural appropriation. People have good intentions. It's important to share a cultural experience. I don't think it's overdone here at all. I love that they have the Mexican corn here too \u2014 that was a big part of my childhood!\"\n\nIn Taza's packed factory store, dozens of people crowded around the Chipotle Chili and salted almond shards.

You should try this.'\"\n\nShe didn't like it a first. But the discreet e-cigarette, which looks like a USB flash drive, was soon everywhere.\n\nPeople at school would huddle in bathrooms, Gordon said, taking puffs of the device's different flavored tobacco pods. \"It just became, like, more and more popular,\" she recalled.\n\nBy senior year of high school, Gordon, now 18, said, just about everyone was \"Juuling.\"\n\nIn the three years since Juul first hit the market in mid-2015, e-cigarette use among teenagers has exploded.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control is expected to report this year that the number of high schoolers who were using an e-cigarette in 2018 is roughly 3 million, up more than 75 percent since last year's National Youth Tobacco Survey by the CDC.\n\nThe company has grown to dominate the rapidly expanding e-cigarette market, with over 74 percent market share and a roughly $16 billion valuation.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has scrambled to address what Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is calling an \"epidemic\"of youth e-cigarette use.\n\nIn September, Gottlieb announced he was giving Juul and four other e-cigarette manufacturers 60 days to present their plans to prevent youth access to e-cigarettes, or face regulatory consequences.\n\nOlivia Gordon, who participated in the UCSF study on teen use of e-cigarettes, demonstrates how students at her high school would hide Juul in their sleeves and sneak puffs of the device during class. NBC News\n\nThat deadline is fast approaching, leaving the FDA with a complicated decision to make \u2014 restrict access to a product that advocates say is helping adult smokers quit cigarettes, or permit access while kids revive a nicotine habit that had previously been at an all-time low.\n\nAccording to unpublished numbers from the CDC's 2017 National Youth Tobacco Survey, 46.7 percent of kids who had tried an e-cigarette had never tried a traditional cigarette.\n\nIn a statement released Wednesday, Commissioner Gottlieb said the FDA has had productive discussions with five e-cigarette companies about their proposals to stem youth use of their products, but noted \"we may need to take actions that narrow the off-ramp from smoking for adults in order to close the on-ramp to nicotine addiction to kids.\"\n\nThe devices fell under FDA regulation in 2016, but the agency has deferred its authority to regulate e-cigarette companies' pre-market applications until 2022. Products that were on the market before August 2016, like Juul, were allowed to remain on shelves without review. Revisiting that decision is one of the options the FDA has floated if e-cigarette companies' responses to their deadline are not satisfactory.\n\nThe potential long-term effects of e-cigarettes \u2014 including Juul \u2014 are still largely unknown.\n\n\"Juul's been on the market since 2015. We have data from the time the product was on the market to now, and we will collect data over time,\" said Ashley Gould, Juul Labs' chief administrative officer. \"We don't have 10 years of data on the product. It hasn't been on the market that long.\"\n\nAshley Gould, chief administrative officer of Juul Labs. NBC News\n\n\"We have on our website, we have on our packaging, that this product contains nicotine. We have all of the ingredients in the product. And we say this is what we know and what we don't know about the product.\"\n\nWhile the FDA does prohibit e-cigarette companies from touting their products as safer or less harmful than cigarettes, the idea that e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes is ubiquitous, and the science seems to back it up.\n\nIn January 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded there was substantial evidence that \"exposure to potentially toxic substances from e-cigarettes is significantly lower compared with combustible tobacco cigarettes\" and that completely switching from regular cigarettes to e-cigarettes \"results in reduced short-term adverse health outcomes in several organ systems.\"\n\n\"We've never said that this product is good for your health,\" noted Gould. \"This is an alternative to a product that's killing half of the people who are using it.\"\n\n\"I had a lot of patients coming into the clinic telling me that they were using e-cigarettes or the Juul, and they were asking me if it was safe to use,\" said Dr. Mark Rubinstein, who studies nicotine dependence in adolescents at the University of California San Francisco. \"I just didn't have an answer for them.\"\n\nDr. Mark Rubinstein studies nicotine dependence in adolescents at the University of California San Francisco. NBC News\n\nRubinstein decided to launch the Teen Vaping Study, a year-long research project analyzing adolescent e-cigarette use.\n\nRubinstein and three co-authors from UCSF published research in the peer-reviewed medical journal Pediatrics in April showing that teens who used e-cigarettes had significantly higher levels of five chemicals in their urine than teens who didn't use e-cigarettes or cigarettes.\n\nThe study compared 67 teens who were only using e-cigarettes to 16 teens who were using both e-cigarettes and cigarettes and a control group of 20 teens who weren't using either product.\n\n\"We found a lot of the same chemicals in the urine of these teenagers that we see in cigarettes,\" he explained, \"at much lower levels than traditional cigarettes, but higher than what we expect to find from just environmental exposures.\"\n\n\"The five main chemicals that we found are either shown to be cancer causing or thought to be cancer causing, either in humans or animals,\" said Rubinstein. \"There's no reason adolescents, healthy adolescents, should be exposing themselves to even potentially cancer-causing substances,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement to NBC News, Juul pointed out that the study was not designed to draw conclusions about any one e-cigarette brand in particular, because the kids in the study were self-reporting which products they were using.\n\nRubinstein's study also found that teens who reported using fruit flavored e-cigarettes \u2014 the most popular flavor category in Rubinstein's study \u2014 had significantly higher levels of one chemical in their urine than teens who used other flavors.\n\nThat chemical, acrylonitrile, is classified by the EPA as a \"probable human carcinogen.\"\n\n\"I actually reanalyzed the data just to make sure it wasn't because the fruit flavors were more appealing, so the kids were vaping them more frequently. They weren't. Even if you controlled for how much they were using, the fruit flavors seem to produce more toxins,\" Rubinstein said.\n\nThe FDA has singled out e-cigarette flavoring as one of the drivers behind youth usage of the products, but scientists say it's also one of the biggest unknowns when it comes to e-cigarettes' long-term health effects.\n\nWhile flavoring components in e-cigarettes are often safe for use in food or cosmetics, many of the flavoring chemicals used in e-cigarettes have not been studied for inhalation toxicity.\n\nDr. Maciej Goniewicz prepares a pack of Juul pods to be tested at his lab at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York. Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center\n\nMaciej Goniewicz is a pharmacologist and toxicologist at the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y., which recently won a $19 million federal grant to spearhead the nation's first research program dedicated to flavored tobacco.\n\n\"I think we have a good knowledge currently of what is in the product. How much nicotine is in the different products, how it is delivered to blood,\" Goniewicz said, \"Unfortunately, what we are missing today are data from the long-term studies. We don't know what is really the health risk that may be associated with using those products for many years.\"\n\nAlthough Juul lists only five ingredients on its packaging, Goniewicz tested the liquid of three Juul pods for NBC News \u2014 Mango, Fruit Medley, and Virginia Tobacco \u2014 and identified a lengthy list of chemicals that fall under just one of Juul's five ingredients, \"flavor.\"\n\nIt's many of these chemicals that he says have unknown long-term health impacts, especially if users are continuously exposed to them over a long period of time.\n\n\"A regular user of electronic cigarettes will be exposed to those chemicals every day with hundreds of puffs per day for probably many years. And this is a really important question that we would like to know and we trying to answer with our research. What's going on after this repeated exposure? After years of using the products?\"\n\nGoniewicz noted that the existing research gives him the confidence that e-cigarettes like Juul \"are less risky products than tobacco cigarettes,\" but added that he \"will not make the assumption that those products are safe.\"\n\nIn a comment to NBC News, Juul Labs said it follows appropriate standards for product labeling: \"Our product includes glycerol, propylene glycol, flavor, nicotine and benzoic acid. Flavor consists of other components, and we provided the FDA with the ingredient list as required, but the specific formulation of the flavoring is proprietary information.\"\n\nIn research that it presented at a nicotine conference this year, Juul's data on its aerosol indicates undetectable levels of three of the same toxicants Rubinstein found in significant amounts in the urine of his sample of e-cigarette users.\n\n\"It's critically important that youth are educated about the harms of nicotine, what we don't know about e-cigarettes, and why these are not products for them. We agree 100 percent with that. We also agree that adult smokers deserve alternatives to a product that is killing half of them.\"\n\nThe company has drawn ire for its marketing practices, with critics particularly zeroing in on a 2015 advertising campaign that featured young and attractive models.\n\nGould says that was never the goal. \"Our 2015 campaign was done at a time that the company was very small. If we could go back and do it differently, we would, but t he intention was always to reach adult smokers. We fully take the criticism that that campaign was not successful in that.\"\n\n\"If I knew how to have youth not be interested in the product and we could just snap our fingers and make that happen, we would do it immediately, obviously,\" Gould said.\n\nJuul Labs has taken a number of actions since then to address its product's popularity with young people, most notably by removing all of the product-related content from its social media pages in favor of testimonials from adult smokers.\n\nNevertheless, two attorneys general are currently investigating Juul's marketing practices \u2014 Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein \u2014 and earlier this month the FDA conducted an unannounced inspection of Juul's headquarters in San Francisco, seizing thousands of sales and marketing documents.\n\nDuring a panel on the risks of e-cigarettes hosted by the news website Axios in September, Gottlieb said he's considering \"a range of options\" when it comes to e-cigarette regulation. One option that the FDA has raised is restricting access to flavors that appeal to kids, or even pulling them from shelves entirely.\n\n\"I've heard the argument that, if they want to quit smoking cigarettes, they don't want to be reminded of that tobacco flavor,\" Rubinstein, \"Unfortunately, the flavors that they've chosen, like cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9, fruit medley, mango flavor, are definitely something that's appealing to children.\"\n\n\"So I would argue, maybe we could limit the flavors for adults to flavors that are used in nicotine replacement, like cherry and orange.\"\n\nGould said flavors are imperative to Juul's mission, \"Our data tells us that flavors are incredibly important to adult smokers to switch.\"\n\nIn the meantime, public health experts worry that the teenagers who experiment with e-cigarettes may not be able to stop once addicted to the nicotine. Studies show that kids who use e-cigarettes are more likely to move on to smoking traditional cigarettes.\n\nIn the beginning, Gordon didn't realize there was nicotine in the product \u2014 one pod of which has about as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes \u2014 and she only took a puff or two when a friend offered, but by her senior year, Gordon had her own Juul, and was using it upwards of five times a day.\n\nStill, Gordon doesn't think she's addicted.\n\n\"I'm more concerned about the people who are using it more often than me because that's where it's, like, turns,\" Gordon explained, \"I feel like, I haven't been doing it enough, or often enough, for it to have a lot of negative side effects.\"\n\nRubinstein is currently working on another paper about the kids in his Teen Vaping Study, and one thing is clear. Juul's popularity isn't going anywhere.\n\n\"In the beginning of the study, I would say just under a third of the kids [who vaped] used a Juul. Over the course of the study, the majority of kids switched over to Juul.\"\n\n\"We don't know that these kids will continue to use for many years,\" Dr. Rubinstein said, \"But should they, we expect to see some of these same negative outcomes that we see with cigarettes.\"", "Fan arrested after throwing beer at Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora copied!\n\nA Boston Red Sox fan was arrested and charged during the World Series parade after throwing a can of beer at the team\u2019s manager Alex Cora.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Adam Edelman and Dartunorro Clark\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday released a racially divisive political ad that blames Democrats for allowing an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing police officers to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe 53-second video, which was pinned to the top of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed on Thursday, refers to Luis Bracamontes, who was convicted and sentenced to death this year for killing two California police officers in 2014.\n\nBracamontes is from Mexico and was in the U.S. illegally in 2014 at the time of the murders. He had been deported twice, but returned to the U.S. illegally both times.\n\nThe ad \u2014 which comes amid a renewed push by Trump just days before the midterms to focus on illegal immigration \u2014 opens with text stating: \u201cIllegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocrats let him into our country \u2026 Democrats let him stay,\u201d the text continues, over video from Bracamontes at his sentencing hearing earlier this year, during which he said, \u201cI don't f------ regret that.\u201d\n\nThe ad then shows video of the migrant caravan heading north through Mexico, followed by text that reads, \"Who else would Democrats let in?\"\n\nTrump provided no evidence for his claim that Democrats are responsible for Bracamontes' presence in the country, and support appears scant. Trump has routinely painted sanctuary cities \u2014 jurisdictions in which local authorities do not comply in some way with federal immigration authorities \u2014 as hotbeds of crime that allow dangerous criminals to roam the street. Evidence doesn't support his claims that sanctuary cities are more dangerous than other cities, but even so, Sacramento County, which is largely Democratic and where the killings took place, is not a declared sanctuary jurisdiction for undocumented immigrants, according to The Sacramento Bee.\n\nBracamontes assumed several different identities while he was in the country illegally, and law enforcement officials said at the time of his arrest they did not have a \"full picture of his identity,\" according to The Associated Press. Bracamontes was first deported in 1997, during the administration of Democratic President Bill Clinton, after being convicted of possession of narcotics for sale. He was then arrested and sent back to Mexico again in 2001 under President George W. Bush, a Republican.\n\nJoe Arpaio, a Republican and the former Arizona sheriff who is an immigration hard-liner and outspoken Trump supporter, told NPR in 2014 that Bracamontes, who also committed crimes in Arizona, may have \"slipped through the cracks.\"\n\nKevin Johnson, an expert on immigration law and dean of the University of California Davis School of Law, told NPR in 2014 that the case is \"a tragic event that's really an exception as opposed to the rule.\" Johnson added that when Bracamontes was in federal immigration custody, he was deported, which is an example of the system working.\n\nTrump has repeatedly tried to pin blame on Democrats for the state of immigration, claiming they refuse to close so-called loopholes in immigration law and falsely stating that the party was at fault for his administration's police of separating migrant families at the border. Trump even appeared to threaten a government shutdown over immigration \"loopholes\" in February.\n\nDemocrats quickly slammed Trump for the ad, with some comparing it to the \"Willie Horton\" ads that ran during the 1988 presidential campaign.\n\n\"This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,\" Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told CNN, adding that the ad is the \"dog whistle of all dog whistles.\"\n\nFormer Secretary of Labor Robert Reich tweeted that it was \"the most desperate and vile ad since Willie Horton\" and slammed Republicans for having \"resorted to fearmongering.\"\n\nThe now-infamous ad, which ran in support of George H.W. Bush during the 1988 campaign, features a mugshot of Horton, who is black, and used his case to attack Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis as soft on crime. When Dukakis was governor of Massachusetts, Horton, who was serving a life sentence for murder, raped a woman during a weekend furlough from prison. The ad played into racial fears and is credited with helping to cost Dukakis the election, but it was also widely condemned.\n\nSome conservatives also criticized the Bracamontes ad.\n\n\u201cThis is, without question, a racist ad,\" tweeted Jamie Weinstein, the host of an eponymous podcast show at the conservative National Review Online.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., called the add \"sickening\" in a tweet Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"This is a sickening ad. Republicans everywhere should denounce it,\" he wrote.\n\nTrump's re-election campaign released an ad this past January that also featured Bracamontes and, without evidence, claimed that Democrats were \"complicit\" in the killings of law enforcement officers, according to the AP.\n\nIn the last days before next week's midterm elections, Trump has tweeted repeatedly about illegal immigration, putting the hot-button issue front and center.\n\nHe's repeatedly railed against the caravan of migrants and refugees heading north through Mexico and, earlier this week, said he would send thousands of U.S. troops to the border and planned to end birthright citizenship with an executive order.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Their father was a lay employee of the Holy See.\n\nEmanuela Orlandi's disappearance has bedeviled investigators. AP file\n\nOver the years, her case has been linked to everything from the plot to kill St. John Paul II to the Vatican bank's financial scandal and Rome's criminal underworld.\n\nSpeculation about her fate was renewed late Tuesday when human bones were found under flooring during renovation work at the Vatican's Embassy to Italy, close to Rome\u2019s Villa Borghese park.\n\nRome's chief prosecutor has been called in and forensic experts are working to determine the age and gender of the bones as well as the date of death. A murder investigation has also been launched.\n\nThe ANSA news agency reported that prosecutors were focusing on whether the remains could be linked either to Orlandi, who disappeared on June 22, 1983, or another 15-year-old girl, Mirella Gregori, who went missing a month earlier in Rome, on May 7, 1983.\n\nPietro Orlandi said the possibility of the bones being his sister was \u201cpainful\u201d because he maintains she could be alive unless a body is found.\n\n\u201cIf Emanuela\u2019s bones really were found here at the Vatican Embassy, the truth needs to come out after 35 years of silence and cover-ups,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cClearly these 35 years weighed heavily on the Vatican\u2019s image, because there must be something unspeakable in this story.\u201d\n\nPietro Orlandi.

It will continue until we find the truth.\u201d\n\nAmong the theories about Orlandi\u2019s disappearance is that she was kidnapped by a gang demanding the release of the Turkish would-be assassin who shot and wounded John Paul II in 1981.\n\nThe last major twist in the case came in 2012, when forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Orlandi's remains as well.

A third senior executive named in the Times article had been allowed to stay at the company but resigned on Tuesday.\n\nIn New York, Google employees streamed out of the company's office in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan and walked to Hudson River Park, many carrying signs pointing to the company's payouts and still wearing their Google employee badges and company gear.\n\nElissa Brown, a Google employee in New York, said she was surprised by how many staffers participated in the walkout and believed the company was listening.\n\n\"I think they\u2019re taking it very seriously and recognizing that this is a problem to be addressed,\" Brown said. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being taken lightly by anybody.\u201d\n\nBrown said she did not believe issues with how companies handle sexual misconduct were particular to Google.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unique to Google at all, unfortunately,\" Brown said. \"In fact, in general I\u2019ve found Google to be very respectful place to work, and I think that situations like this, you can see looking around you the amount of people that feel empowered.\"\n\nNicole Durbin, a contractor for Google, said she hoped \"to see more transparency and more positive attention to the issue and have things not get swept under the rug.\u201d\n\nIn San Francisco, Google employees nearly filled a plaza named for Harry Bridges, a 20th Century immigrant and union organizer.\n\nOrganizers used a bullhorn to lead chants such as \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are workers\u2019 rights.\u201d They also read aloud reports of discrimination and harassment from their workplaces, including one report that said a manager wasn\u2019t punished after telling two employees that he\u2019d like to see them make out.

The Supreme Court quashed this sentence by a lower court and ordered it to review its verdict.\n\nThe majority opinion of a panel of Supreme Court judges is that \"conscientious objection of military duty ... can be a valid reason\" to avoid military service, the top court said in a statement.\n\nSince the 1950-53 Korean War, South Korea sent about 19,350 Jehovah's Witnesses to prison for refusing to serve in the military. In recent years, about 500-600 Jehovah's Witnesses went to prison every year and spent 18 months behind bars on average. According to the group and the Supreme Court, Thursday's ruling won't apply to 96 Jehovah's Witnesses currently in prison.\n\nThe South Korean office of Jehovah's Witnesses hailed the ruling as a \"historic verdict that will be remembered for a long time for showing the matureness of the country's human rights awareness.\"\n\n\"This verdict was possible thanks to the patience of my predecessors and colleagues totaling some 20,000 people,\" Oh told reporters, according to Yonhap news agency. \"I hope there will also be forward-looking and positive rulings in about 930 pending cases too.\"\n\nOh said he'll try to conduct an alternative form of civil service.

Eisenstein\n\nSafety is one of the biggest factors to consider when shopping for a new car, but advanced driver assistance systems such as lane keeping assistance and forward collision warning can bump up repairs by thousands of dollars, according to a new survey by AAA.\n\nMuch of this technology, known as ADAS, is standard or available in low-cost packages \u2014 and research shows these systems can significantly reduce the likelihood of a crash. But when an accident does happen, cars equipped with features like blind-spot detection can cost as much as $3,000 more to repair.\n\n\u201cAdvanced safety systems are much more common today,\u201d said John Nielsen, AAA\u2019s managing director of Automotive Engineering and Repair. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that drivers understand what technology their vehicle has, how it performs, and how much it could cost to repair should something happen.\u201d\n\nResearch released earlier this year by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows these features can be highly effective. The nonprofit group estimated forward collision warning with auto-braking, for example, can prevent one in six front-end crashes, while lane departure warning lowers incidents of single-car, sideswipe and head-on crashes by 11 percent, while also cutting by 21 percent the number of crashes resulting in injuries.\n\nBut in order for these new ADAS technology to serve as an electronic co-pilot, automakers have to build in a variety of high-tech sensors. These can include as many as a half-dozen cameras, as well as low- and high-power radar, laser, and sonar sensors. And, in the not-too-distant future, they will be adding LIDAR, a high-resolution, 3D-laser technology.\n\nThe problem is that many of these devices are mounted in harm\u2019s way. In vehicles with cross-traffic alert, which helps alert a motorist backing out of a perpendicular parking spot, there\u2019s a radar sensor in both rear fenders. Blind-spot detection usually requires a camera or radar sensor in the side view mirrors.\n\nSo, dent a fender or smack a mirror and you might need to repair or replace one of these sensors. AAA found that in a minor front or rear collision involving a car with ADAS technology the repair costs can run as high as $5,300. That\u2019s about $3,000 more than repairing the same vehicle without the safety features.\n\nEven one of the most common vehicle repairs, a cracked windshield, can become far more costly on a vehicle with ADAS. It\u2019s a headache that AAA says 14.5 million American motorists have to deal with each year. But what was traditionally an easy process becomes far more complicated when you have cameras and other safety devices positioned behind, or mounted directly on, the windshield, as manufacturers like Subaru and others do.\n\nThat can require a technician to carefully recalibrate the ADAS system. Some manufacturers also require special glass with a higher level of optical clarity. On average, AAA found, it costs about $1,500 to repair the windshield in a vehicle with a camera system behind it, about three times more than in a less sophisticated model without the safety sensor.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for windshields to get chipped or cracked, especially for drivers who commute on a daily basis,\u201d said AAA\u2019s Nielsen. \u201cThis may be an eyesore on a regular car, but when it falls in the line of sight of a camera or the driver, it becomes a safety issue that needs immediate attention by a facility qualified to work on these systems.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the fact that repair costs will run higher that motorists have to consider. Fixing a vehicle equipped with ADAS technology also requires turning to a collision shop with the right equipment, as well as technicians trained in recalibrating a broken sensor.\n\nOn the plus side, these new technologies are preventing thousands of collisions, while also reducing the number of injuries and deaths that occur on U.S. roads each year.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Each time, the filing said, he made clear that he was the only person who could help her become an actress.\n\nA few years later, when Doe said she was dating a wealthy man, Weinstein got possessive and chastised her for being unavailable for him sexually, the filing said. One time, the filing said, he showed up at her building and tried to get access to her room, but security refused to let him up.\n\nIn another encounter described in the filing, Weinstein blurted out his sexual attraction to Christina Aguilera, who was being shown on a television, and then allegedly unzipped his pants and touched his penis.\n\nJane Doe first froze, and then fled the office,\" the filing said.\n\nWeinstein is also facing criminal charges involving allegations that he raped an unidentified woman in his Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.\n\nThat case was recently roiled by back-to-back allegations that a New York City police detective acted improperly.\n\nProsecutors dropped a criminal charge involving a third woman after evidence surfaced that Det. Nicholas DiGaudio coached a witness to keep quiet when she raised doubts about the veracity of the allegation.\n\nDays later, prosecutors revealed that DiGaudio allegedly urged the 2013 rape accuser to delete material from her cellphones before she handed them over to prosecutors. The woman didn't delete any information and instead asked a lawyer for advice, prosecutors said.\n\nBrafman has argued that the 2013 rape allegation is contradicted by warm emails the accuser sent Weinstein after the date of the alleged attack.

Warring fiefdoms are consolidating for self-preservation. There is talk that even greater change is still to come. But as the smartest media executives know, chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. The tumultuous changes in technology, distribution and consumer habits present great opportunities for innovative minds with the ambition and resolve to fight.\n\nWhile Hollywood has always been a land of warring factions, today is different: A smaller number of houses exert greater control over the continent. Each is seizing the means of distribution through internet-delivered-direct-to-consumer services. And, in the not-too-distant future, each house may build walls around its intellectual property to further solidify its holdings. Those who want access to \"Star Wars\" will have to pay homage (and gold) to House Disney; those who want to watch \u201cWestworld\u201d will have to pay homage to House Warner, etc.\n\nMuch is unknown about how Hollywood's Streaming Wars will play out. Some houses have deep pockets and can spend limitless sums on talent and show runners. Some houses have built powerful armies of intellectual property through decades of acquisition. Some houses appear to simply be betting on the magic of the internet\u2019s \u201cover the top\u201d capabilities or the promise of high-speed 5G wireless internet.\n\nConsumers, however, only have so much money, meaning that in the streaming wars, as Cersei would say, your house wins or your house dies. Those who have the best content will win the attention of audiences around the globe; those who do not will disappear, their banners lost to history (or maybe acquired by a bigger house).\n\nHere's a guide to the most powerful houses of Hollywood. The Streaming Wars have begun.\n\nHouse Netflix: The White Walkers\n\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings as the leader of the White Walkers. Robin Muccari / NBC News\n\nFor too long, Hollywood ignored the whispers: It was said that in the north the Night King Reed Hastings was using billions of dollars in original content spending \u2014 more than $8 billion this year alone \u2014 to amass an ever-growing army of dedicated subscribers that was moving south, hell bent on replacing all of Hollywood with a zombie order.\n\nNow, Netflix has arrived and Hollywood's kingdoms face an existential crisis. Yet it has also been said that Netflix has secret weaknesses. Rumors of unsustainable debt, dissatisfied content creators and a \"ruthless, demoralizing\" culture mean that winter may have come, but spring may be just around the corner.\n\nHouse Disney: The Starks\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger and as the leader of House Stark. Robin Muccari / NBC News\n\nLed by the unflinching but respected Bob Iger, theirs has long been the most admired in the land. But whispers from Northern California foretold the rise of new streaming services that threaten House Disney and all the fiefdoms of Hollywood.\n\nNow, the King of Burbank, heir to Walt, plots his revenge. Iger\u2019s greatest weapon is his pack of dire wolves: Pixar, Marvel, Lucas and Fox. With unparalleled brand history and the ultimate intellectual property arsenal, he hopes to create a streaming service with a content portfolio of unparalleled quality \u2014 and restore Disney to the throne.\n\nHouse Amazon: The Lannisters\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos on the Iron Throne as the leader of House Lannister. Robin Muccari / NBC News\n\nLord Jeff Bezos sits atop the streaming kingdom with immense power and riches. More than 100 million Prime members are but loyal serfs in his empire, paying their annual or monthly tithe for access to everything, with two-day delivery.\n\nPower hungry and eager for complete, Alexa-enabled domination, he bids his minions to create the next great television saga that will command the respect of all the kingdoms. They return with the rights to \"Lord of the Rings\" for a mere $250 million. His greatest assets are his gold and his ever-expanding stores of consumer data.\n\nHouse Warner: The Iron Bank of Braavos\n\nHBO CEO Richard Plepler and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson as the purveyors of the Iron Bank. Robin Muccari / NBC News\n\nThe Iron Bank of Braavos. Led by Randall Stephenson, the kingdom's largest telecommunications company has long carried the various fiefdoms by providing them with cable and mobile distribution. But like all ambitious bankers, they want to be owners.\n\nNow, through debt and acquisition, Warner has assembled an army of mercenaries \u2014 HBO, Warner Bros. and Turner \u2014 and is aiming to expand its content powerbase and take on the other houses. An old but powerful force, it is still learning the rules of a new game and relying on veterans like HBO\u2019s Richard Plepler to chart the course.\n\nHouse Comcast: The Tyrells\n\nComcast CEO Brian Roberts as the leader of House Tyrell. Robin Muccari / NBC News\n\nThe Tyrells. Comcast has long been a wealthy and prestigious house. The business was strong, from broadcast to cable to theme parks. But with the streaming wars consuming the land, Brian Roberts, King of Thorns, knew he needed to guide one of the largest media conglomerates ever through a transition to meet the next phase of consumer habits.\n\nSo Roberts set out to do battle with House Disney for 21st Century Fox. After a devastating loss, Roberts instead acquired Sky, and is now obsessively trying to forge a future for his great house via his grandchildren: NBCUniversal, Xfinity and Sky. (NBC News is a bannerman of NBCUniversal.)\n\nHouse Apple: The Targaryens\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook as the leader of House Targaryen. Robin Muccari / NBC News\n\nNetflix, Disney, Amazon, Warner, Comcast, they're all just spokes on a wheel. One is on top, then another, and on and on it spins ... but in a distant land, Tim Cook has hardware dragons and a massive army of loyal, affluent users who see him as a rare source for good in a tech industry rife with controversy and questions of trust.\n\nNow, Cook has shifted his gaze to Hollywood. No one knows how the invasion will proceed. Cook's hand, Eddy Cue, has acknowledged that Apple \"doesn't know anything about making television.\" But Cook is said to be a benevolent leader, and with his house\u2019s vast tech prowess and unmatched financial resources, it is not difficult to envision a future in which a ruler with silver hair sits on the Iron Throne.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Associated Press\n\nJOHANNESBURG \u2014 One by one, five to a grave, the coffins are buried in the red earth of this corner of a South African cemetery. The scrawl on the cheap wood attests to their anonymity: \"Unknown B/Male.\"\n\nThese men were migrants from elsewhere in Africa with next to nothing who sought a living in the thriving underground economy of Gauteng province, a name that roughly translates to \"land of gold.\" Instead of fortune, many found death, their bodies unnamed and unclaimed \u2014 more than 4,300 in Gauteng between 2014 and 2017 alone.\n\nSome of those lives ended here at the Olifantsvlei cemetery, in silence, among tufts of grass growing over tiny placards that read: Pauper Block. There are coffins so tiny that they could only belong to children.\n\nAs people worldwide flee war, hunger and a lack of jobs, global migration has soared to record highs, with more than 258 million international migrants in 2017. That is an increase of 49 percent from the turn of the century, according to the United Nations.\n\nFar less visible, however, has been the toll of this mass migration: The tens of thousands of people who die or simply disappear during their journeys, never to be seen again. A growing number of migrants have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what on earth happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries around the world, like the one in Gauteng.\n\nIn most cases, nobody is keeping track: Barely counted in life, these people don't register in death, as if they never lived at all.\n\nAn Associated Press tally has documented at least 56,800 migrants dead or missing worldwide since 2014 \u2014 almost double the number found in the world's only official attempt to try to count them, by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. The IOM toll as of Oct. 1 was more than 28,500. The AP came up with almost 28,300 additional dead or missing migrants by compiling information from other international groups, requesting forensic records, missing persons reports and death records, and sifting through data from thousands of interviews with migrants.\n\nThe AP's tally is still low. Bodies of migrants lie undiscovered in desert sands or at the bottom of the sea. And families don't always report loved ones as missing because they are illegal, or because they left home without saying exactly where they were headed.\n\nA police officer stands next to the body of Aylan Kurdi, a Syrian toddler who drowned and washed ashore in Turkey in 2015. Nilufer Demir / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nThe official U.N. toll focuses mostly on Europe, but even there cases fall through the cracks. The political tide is turning against migrants in Europe just as in the United States, where the government is cracking down heavily on caravans of Central Americans trying to get in. One result is that money is drying up for projects to track migration and its costs.\n\nFor example, when more than 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Europe's deadliest migrant sea disaster, Italian investigators pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work is being cut off.\n\nBeyond Europe, information is even more scarce. Little is known about the toll in South America, where the Venezuelan migration is among the world's biggest today, and in Asia, the top region for numbers of migrants.\n\nThe result is that governments vastly underestimate the toll of migration, a major political and social issue in most of the world today.\n\n\"No matter where you stand on the whole migration management debate....these are still human beings on the move,\" said Bram Frouws, the head of the Mixed Migration Centre, based in Geneva, which has done surveys of more than 20,000 migrants in its 4Mi project since 2014. \"Whether it's refugees or people moving for jobs, they are human beings.\"", "While the Jordan-Israel pact shows that governments will \"talk about water when they won't talk about anything else,\" Wolf added that debates about how to share the precious resource can \"exacerbate existing tensions.\"\n\nThe \"amount of death and destruction\" linked to water crises \u2014 which range from violent disputes to the spread of disease to famine \u2014 is on par with the toll from malaria and HIV/AIDS and \"almost bigger than all the wars in any given year put together,\" according to Wolf.\n\n'Cradle of civilization'\n\nRain and fresh water resources heed no borders. Prolonged droughts and shifts in precipitation patterns are now exacerbating the issue throughout the region.\n\nAcross Jordan's border in Iraq, the implications of not having access to water were highlighted when at least a dozen people were killed in protests that broke out in the oil-rich southern province of Basra earlier this year after 102,000 people fell ill due to an unclean supply.\n\nRainfall has decreased in the south and western parts of the country in the past seven decades. Hassan Janabi, a former Iraqi minister of water resources, told NBC News that inflows through the Tigris and Euphrates river systems \u2014 the area known as the \"cradle of civilization\" \u2014 have dropped by 60 percent since the 1970s. That has taken a toll on agriculture, which supports one-third of the country's 32 million people living in rural communities.\n\n\u201cThis year I could not plant at all,\u201d said Ali Sagban, a rice farmer in the southern province of Najaf whose farm has faced water shortages for the last five years. \u201cWe used to live unsafe lives because of explosions, now we are living without water.\"\n\nAnother major force behind the decline in water to Iraq is development in upstream Turkey, which has built five dams on the Euphrates since the 1960s. That's cut the flow to Iraq more than in half, Janabi said.\n\n\u201cWhen you have these social demonstrations, protests, upheavals ... it is dangerous for the country and dangerous for the region,\u201d Janabi warned, referring to the unrest linked to the illnesses. \u201cPeople are very, very angry.\u201d\n\nRivers will shrink even more as the imminent filling of Turkey\u2019s newest dam, the Ilisu, will cut flows of the Tigris into Iraq further.\n\nTurkey complied with Iraq\u2019s requests to postpone the filling of the dam in June due to the dry conditions, but the project designed to generate electricity for the country will eventually move ahead.\n\nTurkey insists it is determined not to cause significant harm to its neighbors and is committed to managing water in a way that benefits everyone.\n\nMany Iraqis blame their own government, not Turkey, for not acting sooner to secure water for the future. Construction of the Ilisu dam began in 2006.\n\nThe government is \u201cpaying no attention to what we are suffering from,\u201d said Rashid Abbas, a corn farmer in the province of Babylon, south of Baghdad. Abbas was among many farmers who led peaceful demonstrations after prolonged drought and the withdrawal of government water for irrigation made planting staple crops impossible this year.\n\n\u201cThere was a rumor that the protests are the first step of an uprising,\u201d said Abbas, adding that many local people fear another year of dry conditions could affect the availability of drinking water.\n\nAnimosity\n\nSyria\u2019s seven-year civil war is also seen by some experts as an example of how water shortages can worsen already tense circumstances. Drought didn\u2019t spark the conflict but it did push many unemployed farmers into cities where poverty and frustration encouraged some people to extreme action, Oregon State University's Wolf said.\n\nThe effects of that war has been felt in neighboring countries, including Jordan, that now struggle to support the millions of refugees that put more pressure on resources. Conflict also halts any potential for negotiating water-sharing deals or building shared infrastructure.\n\n\"If there is not enough water for people to drink or cultivate crops in the Middle East, and that\u2019s a big concern, those people may need to leave the areas where they live and that could lead to destabilizing migration. It could also lead to an escalation of violent protests,\" said Charles Iceland, director of global and national water initiatives at the World Resources Institute.\n\nIceland pointed to Iran as a particularly vulnerable country for escalating incidents in the future if supplies are reduced by climate conditions or upstream countries.\n\nEarlier this year, protests became violent in the southwestern province of Khuzestan as farmers grappled with water shortages. The government denied any deaths occurred but Al Arabiya news channel reported at least four demonstrators were fatally shot.\n\nIsrael has long treated water as a national security issue and has become a global leader in building desalination plants, operating five facilities in predominately public-private partnerships.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that the pressure on water resources has been eliminated. Israel, like Jordan, faces problems ranging from overconsumption to heavy pollution.\n\nWolf, who specializes in transboundary water conflicts, believes the political rhetoric between Jordan and Israel is typical chest-thumping ahead of negotiations over the Island of Peace and not a sign that the overall treaty is at risk.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day they will sit down,\" he said. \"There is no way out except to cooperate.\"\n\nThe Jordan River runs through the Baqoura area, which is also known as the Island of Peace. Linda Givetash / NBC News\n\nHowever, others are not so certain.\n\nYana Abu Taleb, deputy director of EcoPeace Middle East, an NGO that works with both governments as well as as Palestinian authorities, said the recent political discourse is unsettling. She worries it could be a signal that leaders are changing their approach.\n\nWhile King Abdullah's move lines up with public animosity toward Israel, Abu Taleb said many Jordanians don't understand how complex the country's water challenges are and how the peace treaty is integral in resolving them.\n\nEven before Israel threatened last week to cut the amount of water it shares, rising tensions could already be seen in communities in Jordan.\n\nNeighbors in a once close-knit farming town of Al Karameh quarreled one recent morning after the taps in their homes ran dry.\n\n\u201cAll people need water to drink, to wash,\u201d said Roshka Tayyem, a politician, before getting sucked into the heated argument in the middle of the road.\n\nRoshka Tayyam. Ziad Jaber / NBC News\n\nTayyem's house didn't receive its weekly water supply, so her brothers decided to take matters into their own hands.\n\nBut as they attempted to fix the exposed pipes at the street corner, some neighbors assumed that Tayyem's brothers had caused the problem in the first place. Soon everyone was launching insults.\n\nBassam Salim Rashaydeh, 49, a farmer, said he had to leave his field uncultivated this year because he doesn\u2019t have the water needed for irrigation.\n\n\u201cFarming has been executed here,\u201d he said.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Erika Nicole Kendall\n\nIn 2018, an era when debates about children and food are unending and unyielding, the post-Halloween period has become a problem for well-meaning parents. On what other day of the year does your child come home with multiple pounds of candy? And what other holiday encourages people to give away as much junk food as possible \u2014 often as a reward, but sometimes as a bribe to prevent the unruly among our collective progeny from egging and toilet-papering our homes?\n\nBut the Halloween candy conversation is often more than just a typical parent-child disagreement: More and more parents who struggle with helping their children maintain good health, and with good reason. Over the years, health statistics for children of trick-or-treating age have only become more disconcerting.\n\nFor instance, an increasing number of children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a condition linked to the body\u2019s inability to keep up with the amount of sugar in its blood. Recent studies have shown that far too many toddlers are consuming more than the amount of sugar found in a Snicker\u2019s bar each day. An increase in sugar \u2014 and carbohydrates in general \u2014 in the standard American diet is directly connected to chronic diseases like high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and the attachment to the taste of sweets is hard to break.\n\nAnd as noted by a CDC researcher in the aforementioned study, the predilection for super-sweet tastes starts early, and only increases as the child ages, potentially leading down a path towards poor health.\n\nReasonably, even parents with currently healthy children are reluctant to support them in fully indulging in the spoils of their trick-or-treating, while others may suffer from compulsive and uncontrollable eating themselves, making a plastic pumpkin full of landmines for struggling parents to trip over. Some parents have long had disciplined systems for handling Halloween candy.\n\nSome parents, like my own mom, simply made the candy disappear faster than I was keeping track of: Every time I saw the giant plastic pumpkin, there was less candy inside. Others try to limit the candy to one piece per night, in hopes that the kids ultimately get tired of it altogether (and maybe it becomes the candy given out next year).\n\nYet other parents prefer to opt out of Halloween altogether which, of course, comes at a loss for the children, who miss out on seeing their classmates in their colorful and creative costumes, laughing and playing and meeting neighbors.Even trading candy afterwards can be an incredibly memorable experience for them.\n\nFor instance, my oldest (now approaching her teen years) will gladly tell you how one of her favorite early memories is being four, dressed up as Minnie Mouse and handing out candy to the older neighborhood children who came to our door. Neighbors who were taking their own children around to trick-or-treat would reach in their own pocket and hand her candy, and she\u2019d beam with joy as she put it in her own little pumpkin.\n\nHalloween, despite the junk food concerns in modern-day America, is a time for the community to come together, even if it\u2019s in full costume and involves sticking your hand in a bowl full of peeled grapes masquerading as eyeballs.\n\nIf the candy causes you concern, though, invite The Switch Witch over: Much like how Santa Claus takes your cookies and milk and brings you toys, the Switch Witch takes your Halloween candy that you\u2019ve left out and replaces it with the same. You can even incentivize it by inviting your children to take out a handful of their favorite treats, and then setting the rest out for sacrificing to the Switch Witch for something they\u2019ll enjoy for longer than the candy.\n\nHalloween is a day intended for children to dress up and have fun, but nowadays it might be time to start redefining what that \u201cfun\u201d entails. We can preserve the spirit of the holiday while encouraging moderation or, even, reducing the attachment to sweet tastes altogether. And, if we need to ask for a little help from a friendly Switch Witch, I can\u2019t think of a better holiday for that.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Myers.\n\n\"I'm the only guy that can credibly say that I am not under investigation for corruption by the FBI\u201d DeSantis said, referencing comments made by Trump earlier in the week when he called Gillum a \"stone-cold thief\" and implied without evidence that Gillum was under investigation in a corruption probe in Tallahassee, where he serves as mayor.\n\n\"Maybe we should impeach Gillum,\" DeSantis said to the Florida crowd, which prompted supporters to chant \"Lock him up!\" \u2014 something which is usually reserved for Hillary Clinton at Trump campaign events.\n\nThe closely fought governor's race turned ugly weeks ago when a white supremacist group targeted voters with a telephone robocall imitating Gillum in a minstrel voice. In October, another call circulated calling Gillum a \"negro\" and a \"monkey.\"\n\n\"Race is at the center of the gubernatorial election, there is no question about it,\" said Daniel Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida. \"The race card is overt...We aren't talking dog whistle racism, this is attack dog mode.\"\n\nTrump got in a few of his own shots at Gillum, who polls show is in a toss up race against DeSantis.\n\n\"In Tallahassee, they've had the highest crime rate,\" Trump said, implying that under Gillum crime rose. \"He cannot keep Florida safe.\" Although Leon County, where Tallahassee is located, tops the crime rate in the state, the county's crime rate has decreased during Gillum's tenure as mayor.\n\nThe president also attacked Nelson, who is facing a challenge from term-limited Republican Gov. Rick Scott in another contest that is too close to call.\n\n\"I am here a lot and I never see Senator Nelson until six months before the election,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also double downed on his immigration message in Florida.\n\n\"We are getting prepared for the caravan, folks, you don't have to worry about that,\" Trump said in reference to migrants traveling through Central America and Mexico, hoping to reach the U.S. border. \"They've got a lot of rough people in those caravans, they are not angels.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated his controversial commitment to end birthright citizenship.\n\n\"We will end it,\" he said, promising to \"keep them out of the country.\"\n\nBirthright citizenship is established the 14th Amendment and abolishing it would require Trump to overcome major legal and legislative hurdles.\n\nBefore taking the rally stage on Wednesday, Trump said that he always strives to to tell the truth \u2014 \"when I can\" \u2014 in an exclusive interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl.\n\n\"Well, I try. I do try ... and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change, but I always like to be truthful,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also restated his belief that the migrant caravan is an \"invasion\" on the U.S.\n\n\"When you look at some of them, when you look at some of the people in them, yeah, I think it can be considered an invasion. We can't have it.\"\n\nTrump won Florida in 2016 by a little over 1 percentage point and the state will play a critical role in his re-election.\n\nLike many of Trump's midterm rallies, the rally served the dual purpose of revving up the base before midterms while also laying the groundwork for his 2020 campaign. And it won't be his last stop in Florida before Tuesday's election \u2014 Trump will return on Saturday for a rally in Pensacola.\n\n\"He is going to the most Republican places in the state short of Panama City, which was just destroyed by a hurricane,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a GOP strategist from Florida and an outspoken critic of Trump. \"Fort Myers is three things: Very Republican, very conservative and very, very old. That is his friendly audience which should tell you that it is all about 2020. It is a base-only election for Trump.\"\n\nTrump's Wednesday night event was the first of 11 campaign events he plans to hold around the country in the last six days before midterm elections.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

O'Rourke did not receive a suspicious package in the mail, said the spokesman, Chris Evans.\n\nSayoc, 56, was arrested and charged Friday in connection to a series of pipe bombs that were mailed to fervent critics of President Donald Trump, including former president Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Law enforcement sources told NBC News that Sayoc had a list of 100 potential targets and did research on political figures, journalists and entertainers.\n\nSayoc was charged with five federal counts: interstate transport of explosives, mailing of explosives, threats against former presidents, making threatening interstate communications and assault of current or former officials. He faces up to 48 years in prison if convicted on all counts.\n\nO'Rourke has picked up steam in recent months and given Cruz, an incumbent Republican senator, a tough re-election battle.

The channel has struggled to gain a wide audience in part because TV audiences are older than Vice's usual demographic.\n\nThe show would cover everything from Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh to rapper Cardi B, Viceland development executive Nomi Ernst Leidner told the magazine, and is aimed at bringing older viewers to Viceland. The show is slated to debut in early 2019.\n\n\"It creates consistency in a schedule,\" Dubuc told the magazine. HBO has an exclusive deal on Vice news programming, according to the article, though Dubuc said she doesn't believe there is a conflict.\n\nThe news was greeted with surprise by HBO executives, who learned about it via The Hollywood Reporter article, according to a person familiar with the situation who requested to remain anonymous due to business relationships.\n\nWhile HBO is owned by AT&T's WarnerMedia, the Viceland cable channel is operated by A&E Networks, which is majority owned by Disney, which also has a stake in Vice.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice's weekly news show on HBO will end after its current season, the source said. HBO will retain Vice's other news content, including specials and \"Vice News Tonight,\" a news program that airs four nights a week.\n\n\"What is the right amount of Vice?\" the source said. \"There was a feeling that with the specials, the weekly and the daily, it's just too much.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Vice declined to comment.\n\nHBO's interest in news is growing. The company created a partnership to air news specials from Axios, the news website, and it also airs \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" a topical talk show and \"Last Week Tonight with Jon Oliver.\"\n\nThe channel also planning to air four live specials from Crooked Media, which has emerged as a popular liberal politics outlet thanks to its podcast, \"Pod Save America.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

His attorneys requested a two day continuance.\n\n\"We look forward to our day in court. Mr. Ahmad is presumed innocent until proven guilty,\" Ahmad's federal public defender, Walter I. Gonclaves Jr., said in an emailed statement.\n\nIn late 2016, the filing in U.S. District Court in Arizona alleges, the suspect told an FBI informant that \"he knew how to detonate a bomb by using a cellular phone with a removable cellular battery.\"\n\nThe suspect told the informant he learned the detonation technique during \"the war in Iraq,\" according to the complaint, which does not specify whether Ahmad, a U.S. citizen, ever served in the U.S. military.\n\nThe informant asked Ahmad in the spring of 2017 if he could \"show him how to make a car bomb for a target in Mexico,\" the complaint reads. The suspect allegedly said he could.\n\nDays later Ahmad showed the informant \"an image of explosive materials and instructions on his cellphone\" that were in Arabic, the complaint states.\n\nLater, the FBI alleges, the suspect sent a text message with \"a bomb recipe written in Arabic.\" The filing said that the result would have been a land mine or improvised explosive device (IED).\n\nAhmad agreed to travel to Las Vegas to help undercover agents build the device described in the text message, the FBI said.\n\nOn April 26, 2017, the filing alleges, the suspect brought a circuit tester, electrical tape, and Permatex Epoxy to a Las Vegas meeting with the agents, who brought the rest of the ingredients, the complaint said.\n\n\"Over the course of several hours Ahmad built the device and described what he was doing to one of the undercover agents,\" the filing states. \"Ahmad told one of the agents how to connect the blasting caps and where to place the C-4.\"\n\nAhmad also allegedly helped the agent build a second device and explained how both explosives operated.\n\nThe complaint, signed by FBI Special Agent Christopher T.

The ruling overturned in part an Oct. 10 ruling by a federal judge that said voters haven't been illegally purged from Ohio's rolls.\n\nPlaintiffs led by the A. Philip Randolph Institute in June lost their broader challenge to Ohio's election administration process as unconstitutional when the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Ohio's practices.\n\nVoters wait in line to cast their ballot during Ohio's 12th District special congressional election in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 7, 2018. Scott Olson / Getty Images\n\nBut they continued to challenge the confirmation notices the state sent to voters that set off the process of removing them from county voter rolls after not voting in three federal elections or taking other voting-related actions. They said the letters were too vague on letting recipients know the consequences of not responding.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have a reasonable, and perhaps even greater, likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that defendant's confirmation notice did not adequately advise registrants of the consequences of failure to respond, as the NVRA (National Voting Rights Act) requires,\" the court ruled Wednesday.\n\nJudges Julia Smith Gibbons and Eric Clay formed the majority. Judge Eugene Siler Jr. disagreed, saying the plaintiff claims were \"all speculation.\"\n\nRepublican Secretary of State Jon Husted said he wouldn't fight the order, to avoid \"an unnecessary source of contention with election only five days away.\" Ohio's procedures will eventually be upheld again, he said, and the state is committed to making it \"easy to vote and hard to cheat.\"\n\nHusted is running for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is in a tight race for Democratic gubernatorial nominee Richard Cordray.\n\nThe voting-rights groups said that some elections in Ohio, traditionally a swing state, have been settled by small margins, and that turning away potentially thousands of voters could alter outcomes.\n\n\"The court's decision will allow more Ohio voters to have their voices heard next Tuesday,\" attorney Stuart Naifeh of the Demos organization said via email. \"Every vote counts, including those cast by voters who may not have been engaged in the political process in recent years. ... In today's ruling, the court recognized that the right to vote is too important to allow states to take it away without giving voters meaningful notice.\"\n\nPartisan fights overballot access have been playing out around the country. Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to suppress votes from minorities and poorer people who tend to vote for Democrats. Republicans have argued that they are trying to promote ballot integrity and prevent voter fraud.\n\nThe 6th Circuit panel found there wasn't an emergency need to block \"purges,\" and that it could consider that part of the appeal later.\n\nHusted said after the Supreme Court ruling in June that no more voters would be removed before the Nov. 6 election."]
