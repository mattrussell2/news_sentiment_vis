Honea said the 14 bodies were recovered in the Camp Fire, thought to be the most destructive wildfire in state history. Nine deaths had previously been reported in that fire.\n\nTwo bodies also were found in the burn zone of the Woolsey Fire in Southern California, officials said.\n\n\"I know that members of our community who are missing loved ones are anxious, and I know that the news of us recovering bodies has to be disconcerting,\" Honea said. \"I will tell you that we are doing everything that we possibly can to identify those remains and make contact with the next of kin.\"\n\n\"My heart goes out to those people. I will tell you that this weighs heavy on all of us,\" he said.\n\nMore than 50,000 people were evacuated or staying in shelters because of the Camp Fire, which broke out Thursday around 6:33 a.m., and a preliminary estimate is that more than 6,400 homes have been destroyed, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire.\n\nThe Camp Fire has burned around 109,000 acres and was 25 percent contained Sunday, officials said. More Santa Ana winds fueling the fires are expected on Sunday.\n\nHonea said that of the 14 new deaths, four were in the Concow area, east of Paradise, and 10 were in the Paradise area. He said 110 people remain unaccounted for but cautioned that some may be duplicative. On Friday, officials said five bodies were found in or near cars that were overcome by flames, and four others were found at residences in Paradise.\n\nSome 250,000 people in California were under evacuation orders from three fires on Saturday, including the Camp Fire, officials said.\n\nTwo of those fires were burning in the Los Angeles area: The Woolsey Fire in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, which accounted for 200,000 of the evacuation orders, and the Hill Fire in Ventura County.\n\nA Los Angeles County firefighter looks on as the Woolsey Fire explodes behind a house in the West Hills neighborhood on Nov. 9, 2018 in Los Angeles.

The National Weather Service warned of \"extremely critical fire weather conditions\" Sunday through Tuesday.\n\n\"Don't be lulled by a false sense of security \u2014 right now Mother Nature has given us a short reprieve. The winds are not blowing,\u201d Ventura County Fire Chief Mark Lorenzen said Saturday afternoon in a media briefing about the Woolsey Fire.\n\n\"But we know tomorrow, Mother Nature\u2019s going to turn her fan back on, and the winds are going to start blowing,\" he said, urging the public to stay vigilant and to be prepared to evacuate if called to do so.\n\nThe two people found dead in the Malibu area amid the Woolsey Fire were discovered badly burned in a vehicle in a driveway, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said.

The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management.\"\n\n\"Come to SoCal and learn the facts & help the victims,\" the tweet, attributed to Scott Austin, the president of the International Association of Fire Fighters 809, read.\n\nTrump in August made similar claims about California's water and environmental management in relation to fires, claims which were rejected by experts.\n\nCalifornia Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also tweeted that lives have been lost and homes burned to the ground, and it was not the time for the president to be engaging in partisanship. Later Saturday, Trump did tweet condolences to the families of those who died.\n\nThe Hill Fire, burning in Ventura County, was at more than 4,000 acres on Saturday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire. Some 400 structures were threatened, and the fire was 70 percent contained on Sunday with full containment expected Thursday.\n\nFire officials and climate scientists have said that climate change is contributing to worsening wildfire conditions in California, raising fears that the state\u2019s fire season may now be year-round.\n\n\"It's really a cumulative effect in that it's changing the landscape. You're getting longer periods of the year when you get these fires. We're literally burning the candle at both ends,\u201d Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told NBC News on Friday.\n\nLos Angeles Sheriff's Department chaplain Pastor Brian La Spade walks through the Points Dume neighborhood of Malibu, California, where members of his congregation live, on Nov. 10, 2018.

She grabbed her medicine bag and her small dog, and when she left \"the whole sky was pink.\"\n\n\"You could see the fire coming,\" she said. \"It was devastating. It's horrible. The worst thing I've ever experienced in my life. I was just \u2014 I'm grateful I got out with my life.\"\n\nPelletier moved to Paradise two years ago after her husband passed away, and bought a house in the town which was destroyed in the fire, she said.\n\n\"It\u2019s a beautiful home \u2014 it was.

Still others warned that loose lips can literally sink ships and get American soldiers killed.\n\nThis stash of 190 propaganda posters from World War I and World War II were found last year on top of two sawhorses in the basement of a Rochester, New Hampshire, library. Fragile but mostly in good condition, the posters offer viewers a glimpse of what life was like during war time and the extent that the American government went to maintain support for the conflict by playing on fear, patriotism and civic duty.\n\n\"Some of these are really neat,\" library director Brian Sylvester said as he thumbed through the posters.\n\n\"Most of them were about supporting the military,\" he said. \"I would call that the main theme. Patriotism. Purchasing war bonds, growing a victory garden, being in support of rationing all that stuff. There is a neat one that has all these pictures of bombs and stuff. The way the artist drew it is there is a skillet at the top dumping out waste fat. That was used for munitions.\"\n\nSylvester said it is unclear how the posters ended up in the library's basement, but the themes give some clues that they were likely there for decades. About 50 posters dating back to World War I championed the American Red Cross, which kept its records at the library. Dozens more promoted war bonds, while two dozen highlighted a World War I program in which libraries collected books to be sent to troops overseas.\n\nMany more look like big post cards, promoting tourist destinations in Britain or featuring a portrait of a soldier from an allied country \u2014 China, the Netherlands and even Ethiopia.\n\nThe best posters look like something painted by Norman Rockwell, with one for war bonds featuring children holding an American flag and another with a nurse watching over a soldier with his eyes bandaged and the words \"Carry On.\" On the flip side, a poster has darker images of Nazis burning books and the words \"Books cannot be killed by fire.\" Another plays on the enemy-in-our midst theme and features a soldier floundering at sea with the words \"Someone talked.\"\n\nAn original Office of Price Administration rationing poster is shown from the archive at the Rochester Public Library in Rochester, New Hampshire on Nov. 8, 2018. Charles Krupa / AP\n\n\"The posters are almost a lost art form,\" Sylvester said. \"People don't do this to try and spread this kind of message anymore. These are such simple messages. It's just really laid on thick.\"\n\nBenjamin Weiss, director of collections at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts who curated its current exhibit on 175 propaganda postcards from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, said certain themes stand out in these kinds of messages.\n\n\"Regardless the type of regime, the type of nation involved, propaganda is designed to rally people toward something and make people hate something,\" he said. \"It's meant to divide the world into the people you want to be part of, the people who are opposed to you.\"\n\nThough he hadn't heard about the New Hampshire posters, Weiss said they also illustrate the power of propaganda with a focus on national themes.\n\n\"That is a key piece of this which is they showed up in Rochester, New Hampshire but they could just as easily of been in Rochester, New York or Rochester, Minnesota,\" he said. \"These were things that were created, in most cases, probably at a central point with the idea they are going to reach the whole country and address the whole country.\"\n\nSylvester said the library has no plans in the near future to display the posters. There are concerns that sunlight would cause the colors to fade. Instead, they have photographed all the posters and are showing them on a computer in the library. They are also planning to host an expert from the Wright Museum of World War II history for a Nov. 29 lecture on the power of war posters.\n\n\"For me personally, it kind of gave me an awareness that libraries played a role in those wars,\" Sylvester said, adding they eventually hope to get the UV-protected glass and acid-free matting needed to display the original posters.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Linda Carroll and Lauren Dunn\n\nA fish oil-derived medication may lessen the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke in patients who are at high risk despite taking statin therapy, a new study finds.\n\nThe medication, which contains high doses of the omega-3 fatty acid EPA, cut the risk of death due to cardiovascular causes, heart attack and stroke by 25 percent, the researchers found. And that was on top of the risk reduction brought about by cholesterol-lowering statins, according to the study, published Saturday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe patients in the new study all had elevated triglyceride levels, with nearly 71 percent having been diagnosed with atherosclerosis and/or already having had a heart attack or stroke and the rest with multiple risk factors, but no heart disease yet.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve stumbled onto something here in terms of a new class of drugs,\u201d said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cHonestly, I think it\u2019s as exciting as the statin era, when statins were first becoming available and we were learning about all the things that they can do. I view this as a similar sort of breakthrough.\u201d\n\nWhat we studied isn\u2019t some over-the-counter unregulated supplement. It\u2019s a prescription drug and very different from regular supplements.\n\nThe drug, formally named icosapent ethyl \u2014 trade name Vascepa \u2014 contains a pure and stable form of EPA. Over-the-counter fish oil supplements contain some EPA along with other omega-3s, but in much lower doses than the prescription medication.\n\nBhatt, the lead author of the study, stressed the fact that icosapent ethyl differs significantly from OTC fish oil supplements. \u201cWhat we studied isn\u2019t some over-the-counter unregulated supplement,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a prescription drug and very different from regular supplements. It\u2019s true it\u2019s derived from marine sources, but it\u2019s highly purified through a complex chemical process and it\u2019s a prescription drug.\u201d\n\nMultiple studies have shown that OTC fish oil supplements don\u2019t protect the heart, Bhatt said. That might at least in part be because one of the other constituent omega-3s, DHA, seems to raise LDL, or \u201cbad cholesterol,\u201d he added.\n\nThe new study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, followed 8,179 patients with elevated triglycerides who either had diabetes plus another heart disease risk factor or had been diagnosed with atherosclerosis and/or had already suffered a heart attack or stroke, for 4.9 years. Patients either got 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice a day or a placebo that contained mineral oil.\n\nThe trial was sponsored by the maker of Vascepa, Amarin Corporation.\n\nPatients were enrolled in the study if they were 45 or older and had established heart disease or were 50 or older and had diabetes plus another heart disease risk factor. Statins had already lowered the patients\u2019 LDL levels, but they were still at high risk for death from cardiovascular disease.\n\nBy the end of the study, hospitalization for chest pain, heart attack, stroke, cardiovascular death and procedures for coronary artery disease such as stenting had occurred in 17.2 percent of the patients taking icosapent ethyl, compared with 22 percent of the patients taking placebos. The researchers also reported a 24 percent reduction in cardiovascular death, nonfatal heart attack and nonfatal stroke \u201411.2 percent vs. 14.8 percent.\n\nWhile the drug did indeed reduce triglyceride levels, that reduction alone wasn\u2019t enough to explain the size of the impact on heart disease in the group that got the drug, experts said.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to be a landmark study,\u201d said Dr. Michael Blaha, director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable.\u201d\n\nWith all the negative results in studies looking at OTC fish oil supplements to prevent heart disease, \u201cI think expectations were low for this trial,\u201d said Blaha, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cBut based on the clinical trial results, I haven\u2019t seen anything this potent in this group of patients in a long time.\u201d\n\nIn fact, not since statins were introduced, Blaha said.\n\nThe new findings \u201cwill absolutely have the potential to change the way we practice,\u201d said Dr. Nisha Jhalani of the Center for Interventional Vascular Therapy at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center. \u201cI think it\u2019s very remarkable.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

In a statement on Saturday, DeSantis said that the results of the election were \"clear and unambiguous, just as they were on Election Night, and I am honored by the trust that Floridians have placed in me to serve as your next governor.\"\n\n\"I want to express my appreciation to the supervisors, the canvassing boards, and the staffs for working hard to ensure that all lawful votes are counted in this election,\" he added. \"It is important that everyone involved in the election process strictly adhere to the rule of law which is the foundation for our nation.\"\n\nOn Saturday, all 67 Florida counties had returned their unofficial results to Tallahassee. Included in that was Broward County, which has been the epicenter of controversy over the Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott.\n\n\u201cWe have every expectation the recount will be full and fair and will continue taking action to ensure every vote is counted without interference or efforts to undermine the democratic process,\" Nelson said in a statement following the announcement. \"We believe when every legal ballot is counted we\u2019ll win this election.\"\n\nScott leads Nelson, who never conceded, by just over 12,000 votes or .15 percent.\n\nScott declared victory Tuesday night, but many organizations, including NBC News, have said the race is too close to call.\n\n\u201cThe voters of Florida have spoken and Rick Scott was elected to the United States Senate in a close but decisive victory,\" said Chris Hartline, a spokesperson for Scott's campaign. \"The margin of victory is larger than any recount since 2000 has ever closed, with the average recount changing the outcome by just a few hundred votes. It\u2019s time for Senator Nelson to accept reality and spare the state of the Florida the time, expense and discord of a recount.\u201d\n\nAt approximately 1 a.m. ET on Wednesday, just hours after the polls closed, Scott led Nelson by approximately 55,000 votes, but as counties continued to count their votes, the difference shrunk to a razor-thin margin.\n\nIt is not uncommon for election officials to continue counting ballots, such as mail-in and provisional, following Election Day.\n\nBut the battle for Nelson's Senate seat has been heated, with both sides filing lawsuits and trading verbal jabs.\n\nScott has said Nelson is trying to steal the election, while Nelson is accusing Scott of trying to stop elections officials from counting every ballot. President Donald Trump has weighed in on behalf of Scott, calling the situation \"a disgrace.\"\n\nTrump on Friday said Scott \"won by a comfortable margin\" before suggesting without evidence that Democrats were committing fraud in the election.\n\n\"Every couple of hours, it goes down a little bit,\" Trump said of Scott's margin.\n\nScott has also hurled unsubstantiated allegations of \"rampant fraud\" at the Broward County supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, and Palm Beach Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher, claiming with no evidence that the supervisors tried to steal the election.\n\nAli Vitali reported from Tallahassee, Florida.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Leigh Ann Caldwell and Julia Ainsley\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two members of congress, a cabinet official, a presidential confidant and a frequent guest on Fox News are among those being considered by President Donald Trump to be the next attorney general, multiple sources tell NBC News.\n\nOne of those, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, was a close adviser to the president in his 2016 presidential campaign. He has been largely sidelined by the administration since then but resurfaced at the White House on Thursday for what White House officials said was for a previously scheduled meeting on prison reform.\n\nRep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, and retiring Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, have also joined the list of those in the running, the sources say.\n\nRatcliffe, a former political appointee of President George W. Bush who was later appointed to be U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Texas, has become a top candidate.\n\nHe was elected to Congress in 2014 and has been named as the most conservative Texas legislator by the Heritage Foundation. He made a name for himself when he grilled former FBI agent Peter Strzok in a House Judiciary Committee hearing about text messages he sent ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nGowdy, who led the House investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's handling of the attack that led to the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, is retiring from Congress at the end of the year and was a prosecutor before coming to Congress. He and Trump have had a contentious relationship, especially since Gowdy voted \u201cpresent\u201d on a House bill to keep the House\u2019s Russia investigation going when every other Republican voted \u201cno.\u201d\n\nNeither Ratcliffe nor Gowdy\u2019s office responded to requests for comment.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is close to Gowdy, has become an adviser to the president on the position. Frequently mentioned for the job himself, Graham has said repeatedly that he is not interested. But anticipating that Sessions would be fired or would resign, he has been working on a list of potential replacements to present to the president.\n\nAnd Graham, who could be the next chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, could have a large say on if the nominee is successful in the Senate.\n\nGraham said he discussed Sessions\u2019 successor with the president at the White House on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m confident the White House is looking for someone who the President and country can have confidence in, and be confirmed by the Senate,\u201d Graham said in a statement.\n\nOther names that have been discussed include Noel Francisco, the current solicitor general of the United States, who was appointed by Trump last year. Trump\u2019s Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar is also a contender, sources tell NBC News.\n\nAzar's spokeswoman, Caitlin Oakley said the secretary is happy in his current job. \"Secretary Azar has repeatedly said that this is the best job he has ever had and that this is his dream job. He plans to continue serving President Trump as his HHS Secretary.\"\n\nAndrew McCarthy, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of new York and current columnist for the National Review, is also said to be under consideration. McCarthy is a common guest on Fox News, which Trump appreciates in an official.\n\nMcCarthy has also written that acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker could be amidst an \u201caudition\u201d for the permanent gig. Whitaker, Sessions former chief of staff, has spoken negatively about the Russia probe when he was an analyst on CNN.\n\nBut Whitaker\u2019s appointment is unlikely, unless he is removed from the acting position. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, a person appointed to the position of Acting Attorney General who has not previously been confirmed by the Senate must step out of the acting position in order to be confirmed on a permanent basis.\n\nFinally, losing Kansas gubernatorial candidate Kris Kobach has been mentioned as well. Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state and member of Trump\u2019s transition team who led a failed advisory board to investigate voter fraud, has also made a name for himself on hard right immigration policies. But most observers say it would be quite difficult for Kobach to ever be confirmed by the Senate because of his controversial positions on hot button issues.\n\nGetting passed the Senate will be a key requirement for any nominee. At least three Republicans have already said that protecting the Mueller investigation is a critical concern.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine said the Mueller probe \u201cmust be allowed\u201d to continue. Senator-elect Mitt Romney tweeted \u201cit is imperative\u201d the probe continues, and Sen.

Lee, Kristen Welker and Kelly O'Donnell\n\nPARIS \u2014 The White House\u2019s decision on Saturday to scrap the president\u2019s visit to a cemetery for fallen American soldiers due to weather is creating a bit of a storm of its own.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was scheduled to take a 30-minute helicopter ride from Paris to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial in Belleau, France. But a rainy forecast for the city made it too risky for him to safely fly there, the White House said a couple hours before he was to arrive at the cemetery.\n\n\"The President and First Lady\u2019s trip to Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial has been canceled due to scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather,\u201d the White House announced.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the roughly 50-mile long trip to the cemetery in a small motorcade of vehicles. The drive took about 90 minutes each way. Separately, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel traveled a similar distance by car to a commemorative event in northern France.\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly, left, and Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, attend a ceremony at the Aisne Marne American Cemetery in Belleau, France, on Nov. 10, 2018. Francois Mori / AP\n\nThe White House\u2019s bad-weather call for Trump is not sitting well with some observers.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a political analyst and former campaign adviser to Macron, posted a photograph on Twitter of someone bicycling in Paris and wrote the weather that kept Trump from the cemetery is: \u201cNothing a cyclist can't handle, let alone a presidential helo.\u201d\n\nA member of the British Parliament and grandson of legendary British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames, was even more critical, calling Trump \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d on Twitter because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t even defy the weather to pay his respects to The Fallen\u201d who \u201cdied with their face to the foe.\u201d\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also participated in armistice events outside the city Saturday, at a battle site about two hours north of Paris by car.\n\nTrump is in Paris for the weekend with dozens of other world leaders to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. On Sunday he's scheduled to attend an event marking Armistice Day and visit a cemetery where Americans who died in both world wars are buried.\n\nKelly Magsamen, who served on the National Security Council under both Republican and Democratic presidents, said it displayed \u201creal low energy,\u201d for Trump \"to not bother to honor the sacrifice of American soldiers in WWI due to some rain. Somehow everyone else was able to do so today.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the criticism, the White House pointed to its initial statement on the matter. The White House typically considers a variety of factors when making bad weather calls for a president\u2019s air travel, including the possibility of changing forecasts and how high the cloud ceiling is.\n\nThe White House did not say why the president chose not to motorcade when taking a helicopter was no longer an option. Instead the president returned to the U.S. ambassador to France\u2019s residence, where he and the first lady are staying in Paris, for about four and a half hours.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo also planned to attend, but he too was deterred by \u201cscheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather,\u201d according to one of his aides.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president\u2019s decision not to travel by motorcade to the cemetery. \u201cWe can't shut the city down for four hours for him to go there and back plus the asset issue\u201d referring to US security resources,\u201d she told NBC News.\n\nSanders said Trump\u2019s view of the change was: \u201cWe had the two best marines that he knows there to represent our country with General Kelly and General Dunford.\u201d\n\nSanders noted the weather doesn\u2019t look promising for Trump\u2019s Sunday trip to honor U.S. soldiers who died in both world wars.\n\nMore than 2,000 soldiers are buried at the World War I cemetery, many of whom died in the Battle of Belleau Wood. Kelly and Dunford, who were joined by their wives, placed a wreath in front of the cemetery\u2019s chapel and walked through the rows of gravestones under a low cloud cover and a light rain.\n\nAfter his visit to the town of Compi\u00e8gne, where Germany and France signed the 1918 armistice, Macron posted a photo of the two leaders at the site with a single word \u2014 \u201cUnis\u201d \u2014 which is French for \u201cunited.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to arrive in Paris Sunday, Sanders said, adding that the two leaders would likely encounter each other briefly this weekend.\n\n\u201cIf anything, it will be a quick hello,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they'll say \u2018hi\u2019 to one another but there\u2019s no formal engagement expected at all.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s tension with Macron over his comment about increasing European defenses in part to protect against the U.S., Sanders said the disagreement had been diffused during their meeting Saturday.\n\n\u201cThey worked that out today in their one-on-one,\u201d she said.", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Qasim Rashid\n\nPrivilege is when, in a two-week span, white men kill 11 Jews in Pennsylvania, two black people in Kentucky grocery store, two women in a Florida yoga studio and 12 people in a California bar, yet no one calls to ban, deport, or profile white men \u2014 or asks, \u201cWhere were they radicalized?\u201d\n\nImagine, for a moment, if the suspects were from a minority demographic like Muslims or immigrants. We would probably send in the military, and many people would demand the minority demographic hold their own members accountable. Does this happen when the suspects are white men?\n\nBut in fact, we don't have to wonder \u2014 we can simply look at the actions of the Trump administration. It took far less for the government to send in the military to counter brown immigrants. Despite the fact that the allegedly dangerous migrant caravan has killed no Americans, the White House literally sent thousands of troops to block them, even initially suggesting American soldiers should have the right to shoot migrants who throw rocks. Meanwhile, gun violence has killed over 12,500 people in 2018 alone. The only real response from the White House have been strongly worded \u201cthoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\nImagine, for a moment, if the suspects were from a minority demographic like Muslims or immigrants. We would probably send in the military.\n\nWorse, the White House still refuses to take meaningful action on gun control and has cut funding to counter right-wing terrorism, despite the epidemic and generational impact of white supremacists. For example, at least five of the 11 victims of what is believed to be the single worst attack on American Jews in history were born before 1945 \u2014 which means they were alive during the Holocaust. The domestic terrorist who targeted them was furious about, among other things, a Jewish organization that has worked to help Muslim refugees.\n\nBut the Pittsburgh attack was far from an isolated occurrence of anti-Semitic violence: In 2017, America saw nearly a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic violence over the previous year \u2014 the single largest increase in one year since 1979 when such data tracking began. \u201cMany just see this an attack on the Jewish community,\u201d said Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. \u201cIt's not. It was an attack on America.\u201d\n\nThe rabbi\u2019s wisdom is deep.\n\nIn 2011, a white nationalist \u2014 not unlike the man who attacked the Tree of Life synagogue \u2014 attacked a Sikh Gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six Sikh Americans, thinking they were Muslim. In 2015, another white nationalist attacked the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine black Christians in what he described as an attempt to start a race war. In 2017, yet another white nationalist attacked a Quebec, Canada mosque, killing six Muslims during prayer. Meanwhile, in 2016, the FBI caught three white nationalists in Kansas as they plotted to bomb an apartment complex and mosque largely comprised of Somali Muslim refugees.\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, the Anti-Defamation league has tracked more than an astounding 900 incidents of white supremacist violence and propaganda incidents. Hundreds of incidents occurred on college campuses. If we think the problem is bad now, what happens in the coming years and decades when these young and impressionable minds become adults, influenced by hateful rhetoric and armed with semi-automatic weapons? Apathy, disunity, and America\u2019s lax gun laws embolden these terrorists. Indeed, even Islamic State terrorists push their radicals to exploit America\u2019s weak gun laws.\n\nGun violence in America is getting so bad that survivors of other attacks are now getting killed later, in subsequent shootings. Borderline Bar in Thousand Oaks, California wasn\u2019t just any bar. Some of the survivors of the Las Vegas shooting met for solace there after the Oct. 1, 2017 attack \u2014 by a white man \u2014 that left 58 dead. Telemachus Orfanos survived that Vegas attack, and was killed in the November 8 Borderline shooting.\n\nThe solution, therefore, is purposeful action, a return to morality and a focus on unity.\n\nPurposeful action mandates commonsense legislation that ensures human rights are more important than gun rights. In a shocking interview regarding the Borderline shooting, Tennessee Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn remarked, \u201cWhat we do is say how do we make certain that we protect the Second Amendment.\" Her focus was on gun rights over human life. Notably, the NRA contributed $1.25 million to her campaign.\n\nWhat Blackburn fails to understand is that commonsense reform does not mean we strip guns from law abiding citizens, it means we make it more difficult for people incapable of safe gun use from acquiring them.\n\nA return to morality mandates we recognize the root causes of mass violence, such as domestic violence. We know that many of the men who commit mass shootings have a history of domestic violence. The shooter in Tallahassee left a well-documented trail of misogyny behind; it is now being reported that the Borderline shooter has his own alleged history of violence against women. And, perhaps not surprisingly, it seems people intervened on his behalf to try and keep him out of trouble. Talk about white privilege. Moving forward, we must allocate more resources to educate young boys and men \u2014 and hold them accountable when they do hurt women and girls.\n\nAnd a focus on unity means that when one of us falls, we all help the fallen stand. In the days after the attack, the Muslim communities of Pittsburgh helped raise over $200,000 for the Tree of Life synagogue. In my \"ReSightIslam\" podcast we discuss how this is precisely in the spirit of the Qur\u2019an 22:40-41, which commands Muslims to stand in defense of all houses of worship \u2014 including synagogues.\n\nThis also means we resist outrage fatigue, a tall order as America\u2019s 2018 mass shooting count has surpassed 300, according to organizations that track it. We must keep talking about these crucial events by remembering the victims, organizing for change and supporting leaders who push back against such violence and racism.\n\nNo easy solution exists to stopping hate and extremism. There is no quick fix. However, by focusing on purposeful action, morality in countering violence against women and unity in the face of extremism, we can try to work towards a world where these attacks do not happen.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Steintrager\n\nChicken soup has long been used to help ward off colds, and it turns out there's some scientific evidence to back up this common sense cure. \"The best-known research, from Nebraska pulmonologist Stephen Rennard, M.D., found that chicken-vegetable soup inhibited the movement of white blood cells that trigger cold symptoms such as a stuffy nose,\" according to a Consumer Reports article about home remedies for colds. Additionally, the steam from chicken soup helps combat congestion, while salt can soothe a sore throat and the broth helps hydrate, Dr. Natalie Azar explained on TODAY.\n\nBut most soups share those same hot, steamy and slightly salty properties with chicken noodle, so when it comes to fighting flus, colds and general seasonal malaise, why not mix things up by adding a few more varieties to your recipe repertoire?\n\nHere, chefs and cooking experts Dorie Greenspan, Andrew Zimmern and Giada De Laurentiis share a few of their favorite versions of the ultimate \"food hug,\" as Zimmern puts it.\n\nElizabeth Newman\n\nWhat's better than homemade chicken soup? Homemade chicken soup that comes together in less than an hour, like this lemony version from TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis. \"It's just like mom\u2019s chicken soup, only my recipe uses spaghetti for an extra comforting twist,\" says De Laurentiis. \"I use store-bought rotisserie chicken too \u2014 making it a breeze to whip up in a hurry.\" The additions of Romano cheese, fresh parsley and fresh lemon juice elevate this soup well above anything you'd find in a can \u2014 plus, you get a little dose of vitamin C from the lemons!\n\nMadeleine Hill\n\n\"Soups are my ultimate comfort food evoking the emotional tug of my childhood, and of course the smell of my grandmother's apron,\" says Zimmern, four-time James Beard Award-winning TV personality, chef, writer, teacher, executive producer and host of Travel Channel's \"Bizarre Foods\" and \"The Zimmern List\" and owner of the soon-to-open restaurant Lucky Cricket in the Minneapolis suburbs. \"My ultimate go-to is my classic chicken soup, which cures every human ill imaginable, even spiritual maladies,\" Zimmern adds of this classic chicken and matzoh ball soup, aka Jewish penicillin.\n\nStephanie Meyer\n\nAmp up your chicken soup experience with Andrew Zimmern's take on a Thai classic. \"Thai hot and sour coconut chicken soup is a beloved favorite around the world, and everyone thinks it\u2019s hard to make, but it\u2019s super easy,\" says Zimmern. \"The coconut milk and the exotic aroma make it truly soul satisfying.\" Plus, adds Zimmern, \"From a wellness standpoint, the broth and chilies in this soup can\u2019t be beat to kill the winter blahs or keep nasty colds at bay.\"\n\nGiada De Laurentiis\n\n\"This broth is a fantastic tune-up for your body,\" De Laurentiis says of her tangy chicken soup with lemongrass, ginger and a Thai chile for kick. \"It's packed with anti-inflammatory veggies and spices such as garlic and ginger, to help with liver function and aid digestion.\"\n\nEllen Silverstein\n\nChicken isn't the only poultry game in town when it comes to feeling better. Proof is in this soup from five-time James Beard Award-winning author Dorie Greenspan's latest cookbook, Everyday Dorie. \"This is the perfect cool-weather soup,\" says Greenspan, whose accolades also include two Cookbook of the Year Awards from the International Association of Culinary Professionals. \"The broth is soothing and satisfying \u2014 it's light, but it's packed with flavor and chockablock with vegetables. The noodles are nourishing and fun to slurp. And the meatballs are tasty \u2014 it would be impossible for them to be otherwise, since they've got plenty of herbs, garlic and ginger, and some yogurt for tang.\" Bonus points for the fact that garlic and ginger might help fight inflammation. Both the broth and the meatballs can be made ahead, and the meatballs can be frozen, then used for all sorts of dishes in addition to the soup, including pasta, bean dishes and sandwiches (try them on a roll with sriracha and mayo, as Greenspan suggests). \"Think of this recipe as soup with additional possibilities,\" says Greenspan.\n\nStephanie Meyer\n\nWhen you're ready to move beyond poultry, try Andrew Zimmern's recipe for beef, beet and cabbage borscht, an Eastern European and Russian staple. Zimmern loves the \"great interplay of vegetal sweetness and mild sour flavors\" in this hearty soup, which he also notes can feed a crowd. \"It's also a great way to eat a ton of superb winter vegetables,\" he adds.\n\nStephanie Meyer\n\nGet all the health benefits of beans and other legumes \u2014 including possibly improving immune function \u2014 with Andrew Zimmern's hearty split pea soup with sausage. \"This was my grandmother\u2019s recipe that I tweaked a bit and it is one of the most popular recipes I\u2019ve ever developed,\" says Zimmern. \"Oftentimes I skip the sausage and just use the ham hock, but using both creates an irresistible layering of meaty flavors. The peas are so good for you, and the soup itself is a stick to the ribs meal in a bowl that simply can\u2019t be beat.\"\n\nGiada De Laurentiis\n\n\"Made with a tiny variety of pasta called stelline, a bowl of these tiny stars was just the thing we were given as kids when we stayed home from school sick,\" says De Laurentiis, who also notes that her daughter likes the little star-shaped pasta, but that you could experiment with other shapes. \"It was warm, soothing and nourishing. Truly a bowl of Italian comfort.\" Also comforting: The soup takes a mere 30 minutes to prep, start to finish, so you can be eating dinner and feeling better quickly!\n\nFor more great soup ideas, learn how to hack your homemade ramen.\n\nMORE BETTER-FOR-YOU RECIPES\n\nWant more tips like these?

I\u2019m more of a moving meditator \u2026 if I\u2019m cooking, if I\u2019m sewing, if I\u2019m waiting or if I\u2019m running, I hit that same state in my head.\u201d\n\nBrit Morin, founder of Brit + Co., told BETTER about the benefits of being creative at her #CreateGood event in New York. Brit + Co.\n\nHer experience of achieving flow while doing something lines up with what researchers have found. You\u2019re more likely to be in the state of flow while working, driving or doing a challenging, engaging activity. It\u2019s less common while people are relaxing or watching TV, according to experts.\n\n\u201cThis is sort of random and very specific, but cake decorating like puts me in that state, I don\u2019t know why, but when you\u2019re piping and decorating a cake you can\u2019t really mess up, it\u2019s hard to scrape it off and re-do it when it\u2019s an entire cake and then the reward is that I get to give it to somebody,\u201d Morin said in an interview at her company\u2019s #CreateGood event in New York.\n\nBeing (and getting creative) has some major benefits\n\nResearch shows that being creative boosts your mood, both in the short and in the long term when practiced routinely. For example, adults who are part of a choir group saw their moods lifted hours after singing. Adults who routinely engage in a hobby report long term improvements to their mental health. Being creative can be especially helpful for people dealing with difficult emotions, anxiety, depression and even trauma.\n\nThe results can be physical too. Multiple studies, for example, have found that adults with heart-related conditions saw improvements to their health (like reduced heart rate and cortisol levels) after participating in music therapy.\n\nRegardless of how creative (or not creative) you feel, trying something fun, creative or picking up a hobby is worth it.\n\n\u201cI fundamentally believe if you\u2019re a human, you\u2019re creative because our ancestors all had to make and create to survive. You probably make food every day, you probably dress yourself every day, you probably have done some sort of interior decorating with your home, we all use creativity to problem solve and transform our lives,\u201d Morin said.\n\n\u201cSo A) stop saying you\u2019re not creative. B) if you want to try a new creative skill, there are so many online communities,\u201d she added.\n\nI fundamentally believe if you\u2019re a human, you\u2019re creative because our ancestors all had to make and create to survive.\n\nYou can find creative online classes on YouTube, Instagram, YouTube, Instagram and Brit + Co, Morin noted.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, creativity is for fun, it\u2019s for meditation, it isn\u2019t something you have to show off to a million people on the internet, so like stop judging yourself so hard and just use it as a creative pastime, a hobby, entertainment.\u201d\n\nMORE TIPS FOR A BETTER DAY\n\nWant more tips like these?

That\u2019s the moral of the latest addition to Hollywood\u2019s action-violence genre, \u201cThe Girl in The Spider\u2019s Web,\u201d which slips into the box office this weekend under the guise of a sequel. But with a completely new cast, all new production team and even a different writer for the source material, the film has an only surface-level resemblance to the films that came before it, let alone the novel. The characters may bear the same names as before, but who they are, and the story\u2019s underlying theme, has been radically altered.\n\nThe original novels were about the ways men hurt and abuse women. In a way it was a story ahead of its time. Lisbeth\u2019s revenge against the men who do ghastly things to women would fit in nicely \u2014 in a hyperbolic way \u2014 with the #MeToo era. But in its subsequent retellings, this central thesis has been watered down and stylized. This latest version is a movie that attempts to turn Lisbeth into a sort of female vigilante James Bond \u2014 franchise potential and all \u2014 by removing her feminist rage against the male patriarchy and instead turning the female characters against each other.\n\nThis latest version is a movie that attempts to turn Lisbeth into a sort of female vigilante James Bond \u2014 franchise potential and all.\n\nThe original Swedish title of \u201cThe Girl with The Dragon Tattoo\u201d was \u201cM\u00e4n Som Hatar Kvinnor,\u201d which translates to \u201cMen Who Hate Women.\u201d The author, Swedish journalist Stieg Larsson, claimed it was inspired by a gang rape he witnessed as a teen. Larsson hoped it would be the first installment in a ten-volume cycle, known as the Millennium series, all of which would focus on feminist social commentary and Sweden\u2019s political climate \u2014 where equality is heavily preached, though not always heavily practiced.\n\nUnfortunately, Larsson only completed three of the installments, all of which were published posthumously: \u201cThe Girl with The Dragon Tattoo,\u201d \u201cThe Girl Who Played with Fire\u201d and \u201cThe Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.\u201d Note that none of these titles match the current film being released. But \"Dragon Tattoo\u201d was made into a Swedish language movie in 2009. It did so well in North America, Hollywood remade it in English in 2011, where it was a hit all over again. Larsson\u2019s publisher then commissioned new stories to be written by crime journalist David Lagercrantz to add to the originals. \u201cThe Girl in the Spider's Web\u201d was the first one to arrive in 2015, followed by \u201cThe Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye\u201d last year.\n\nTo compare the newest film to James Bond therefore works on more than one level. \u201cSpider\u2019s Web\u201d is a sequel to \u201cDragon Tattoo\u201d in the same way \u201cLicense To Kill\u201d is a sequel to \u201cDr. No;\u201d different author, different attitude, different theme, different cast. Obviously, sometimes this concept does turn into a successful franchise. But what made \u201cThe Girl with The Dragon Tattoo\u201d so startling as a story and arresting as a movie has been lost \u2014 perhaps permanently.\n\nBoth versions of the \u201cDragon Tattoo\u201d film were crime thrillers, punctuated with moments of extreme vengeance. The Swedish version was a bit sexier, the America a bit more violent, but their themes stayed on point. Though Lisbeth Salander (played by Noomi Rapace in 2009 and Rooney Mara in 2011) is the heroine, her story is seen through the eyes of Larsson\u2019s avatar, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (played first by Michael Nyqvist and then Daniel Craig), who recognizes her rage and genius. He\u2019s the Watson to her avenging angel Holmes. The mysteries are plotted like Sherlock-style stories too, with careful twists and turns only Lisbeth seems to follow while everyone else blunders behind her.\n\nBoth versions of the \u201cDragon Tattoo\u201d film were crime thrillers, punctuated with moments of extreme vengeance. The Swedish version was a bit sexier, the America a bit more violent, but their themes stayed on point.\n\nThe new film is all about the blundering. Lisbeth (now played by Claire Foy) has no true foil or partner. The only two other names in the cast who are even semi-recognizable are LaKeith Standfield (best known for playing Snoop Dogg in \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d) and Stephen Merchant (best known for being the writer behind Ricky Gervais\u2019 version of \u201cThe Office\u201d). Almost everyone else, including Blomkvist, are played by Swedish, Icelandic and Dutch actors, and their roles feel as secondary as their name recognition.\n\nOn paper, pushing Lisbeth front and center of the story sounds like it should make \u201cSpider\u2019s Web\u201d more feminist than a story told through or by a man. But while she may be the lead, the movie strips away most of what made Lisbeth fascinating. It\u2019s hard to admire a Holmes figure without the framing of a Watson. Moreover, there\u2019s little mystery to the story when seen through her eyes. All the answers become simplified \u2014 they are obvious to her, and so they must be obvious to the audience. Obviously, there is a conspiracy, obviously this is a set-up where someone is being framed and obviously she\u2019s going to pull every piece of technology out of her bag of high-tech tricks to solve it. (The movie is made by Sony Pictures, which you will never forget given the heavy-handed use of product placement.)\n\nWithout mystery, the movie must rely on pyrotechnics and martial arts, the latter of which is not really Foy\u2019s forte. She does her best, but the camera work on the fight scenes is hard to follow anyway so it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nIf at least Lisbeth was aiming to take out misogynistic abusers and brutes, one could cheer along with the explosions. But instead, the villain Lisbeth is confronted by is her own sister Camilla (Sylvia Hoeks). Lisbeth is no longer being tortured by men, but by a woman who we are supposed to believe was made this way by their sexually abusive father. On top of this, she\u2019s also tasked with saving a child in distress, because apparently Hollywood cannot imagine a female character who doesn\u2019t have mothering instincts. It seems all the men so eager to make a profit off this series totally missed the memo about who the real monsters are \u2014 or buried it.\n\nClaire Foy is, as usual, magnetic to watch. She may not be Queen Elizabeth II anymore, but she can certainly command the same level of respect. And yet, the possibilities of her role are curtailed by the production\u2019s lack of vision. I suppose that\u2019s at least a win for equal rights: Women can now star in mediocre action franchises too.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Carol E. Lee, Kristen Welker and Kelly O'Donnell\n\nPARIS \u2014 President Donald Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday amid new tensions in one of the closest relationships he\u2019s forged with a world leader since taking office.\n\nOn the eve of their meeting at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, Trump criticized Macron\u2019s pitch for hardening European defenses to protect the continent from countries including the U.S. as \u201cinsulting.\u201d\n\nThe president also decided not to attend a peace conference Macron is hosting in Paris this weekend, where world leaders are gathering to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\nBut on Saturday morning the pair tried to paper over their differences, with Macron attempting to more clearly explain his vision of a new European army and Trump stressing their friendship and shared positions on \u201cburden sharing\u201d for NATO countries.\n\nMacron called Trump \u201cmy good friend\u201d and even squeezed Trump\u2019s knee at the end of their remarks to reporters, a gesture reminiscent of the bromance that\u2019s defined their relationship.\n\n\u201cWe have become very good friends over the last couple of years,\u201d Trump said of Macron. \u201cWe\u2019re very much similar in our views.\u201d\n\nMacron said his vision of a stronger European defense is intended to ease the burden on the U.S. because \u201cit\u2019s unfair to have the European security today being assured just by the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I do believe that we need more European capacities, more European defense, in order to take this part of the burden,\u201d Macron said. \u201cWhen President Trump has to protect or to defend one of the states of the United States, he doesn\u2019t ask France or Germany, or another government of Europe to finance it.\u201d\n\nTrump has targeted the issue of European countries increasing their defense budgets as members of NATO since he campaigned for the presidency. It\u2019s been one of the leading points of tension in his administration\u2019s relationship with the continent.\n\n\u201cWe want to help Europe but it has to be fair,\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cRight now, the burden-sharing has been largely on the United States.\u201d\n\nMacron is one of the few European leaders who managed to develop a bond with Trump. He hosted the president in Paris last year for France\u2019s Bastille Day celebration, and Trump feted Macron with the only state dinner he\u2019s held during his nearly two years in office.\n\nBut the limits of those efforts have begun to show.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision not to attend Macron\u2019s peace conference, for instance, is seen not only as a snub but also a \u201csign of the man who is not interested in peace,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, a former campaign adviser to the French leader who is now the director of a defense think tank in Paris.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the president, the American president, will be the only one who doesn't stay on for what we call the peace forum, which all of the other heads of state will participate on Sunday afternoon, is a really strange symbol,\u201d Heisbourg said. \u201cThat's going to hurt badly.\u201d\n\nOther world leaders in Paris this weekend, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, plan to attend.\n\nThe question of whether Trump and Putin will have a discussion during the events in Paris, including a dinner Saturday night and a lunch on Sunday, looms over the weekend. There is no meeting scheduled between the U.S. and Russian leaders, who are expected to hold a formal sit-down later this month while they\u2019re both in Argentina for a global summit.\n\nBeyond European defense, Trump and Macron were set to discuss an array of economic, foreign policy and security issues. Macron said their talks would focus on trade, climate change, threats from Iran and the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Trump said terrorism would be a significant topic in their meeting, and that he hoped to advance discussions on trade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can get it over the line, as they say,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMacron said France is committed to increasing its defense budget. His comments seemed aimed at repairing any damage caused by his remarks a day earlier about protecting Europe from the U.S. while discussing cyber security and global instability.\n\nJust before arriving in Paris Friday night, Trump made clear how he interpreted what Macron said.\n\n\u201cPresident Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cVery insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s visit to Paris is his first trip outside of the U.S. since Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections in which Democrats won control of the House and Republicans held the Senate.\n\nHe decided to attend the World War I commemoration after his plans for a military parade in Washington this weekend were derailed because it was estimated to cost more than $90 million. He had called the celebration of Armistice Day a \u201cparade,\u201d though it\u2019s actually a series of events including a ceremony at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe on Sunday.\n\nI am in Paris getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One. Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018\n\nIn general, the theme Macron adopted for the weekend \u2014 international cooperation and the value of alliances \u2014 runs counter to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d world view, and the city is expecting protests on Sunday against the U.S. leader\u2019s policies.\n\nYet another group of protesters in Paris are demonstrating because they agree with Trump. The Accidental Americans Association in France is organizing a protest of America\u2019s policy of automatically granting citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. The group wants its members\u2019 U.S. citizenship to be removed, saying America\u2019s policy forces them to pay additional taxes on their French revenue.\n\nTrump has said he wants to reverse the U.S.\u2019s so-called birthright citizenship policy.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Powell\n\nThe light-year is an indispensable unit of measurement for anyone trying to understand outer space. Get a group of astronomers talking, and you\u2019ll hear them say \u201clight-years\u201d about as often as you hear football fans mention \u201cyards.\u201d\n\nFor nonscientists, though, the light-year can be a puzzling concept. It\u2019s a unit of distance even though it might sound like a unit of time. Adding to the confusion, sci-fi movies and TV shows routinely bungle the concept.\n\nEven the original \"Star Trek\" series got light-years wrong. In a 1968 episode, the alien princess Elaan of Troyius tells Captain Kirk she\u2019d rather hide in her room for \u201c10 light-years\u201d than come out and speak to him. Oops.\n\nHow far is a light-year?\n\nA light-year is the distance a beam of light travels in a vacuum in one year. It\u2019s important to specify a vacuum because light slows as it passes through any kind of matter. (In water, for instance, it travels about 25 percent slower.) Most of the universe is a near-perfect vacuum, so astronomers can generally assume that light is moving at its top speed.\n\nLight travels at 299,792,458 meters (186,282.397 miles) per second. Multiply that number by the number of seconds in a year (31,557,600), and you get your answer: One light-year is 9,460,730,473,000 kilometers, or 5,878,625,373,000 miles.\n\nThat\u2019s probably more digits than you were looking for. Round it off to 6 trillion miles, and you\u2019re still close enough for any in-the-know nerd conversation.\n\nWhy do astronomers measure distance in light-years?\n\nFamiliar units like kilometers and miles are absurdly small for describing the vastness of the cosmos. Take the example of Proxima Centauri, the nearest star beyond the sun. You could say that it's about 24,900,000,000,000 miles away \u2014 or save a lot of breath and call the distance a tidy 4.24 light-years.\n\nMost of the stars you see at night lie within a few hundred light-years of Earth. The Milky Way galaxy in which we live happens to be a nice, round 100,000 light-years across. The Andromeda Galaxy is 2.54 million light-years away \u2014 a big number but still a whole lot more manageable than \u201c14 quintillion, 900 quadrillion miles.\u201d\n\nSo light-years are only a measure of distance, not time?\n\nStrictly speaking, yes. A light-year is a unit of distance, just like feet and inches. If you want to avoid any confusion, you can stop right here.\n\nBut there\u2019s another fascinating side to the light-year story. Since light moves at a finite speed, everything you see is outdated: Your view of the world is actually an image of what things looked like at the instant their light began traveling toward you.\n\nIf you're staring across a room, the lag is just billionths of a second \u2014 utterly imperceptible. Look at the moon, and you see it as it was about a second-and-a-half ago. Watch a sunset, and you're seeing the sun of 8.3 minutes ago.\n\nThe effect is far more pronounced for the stars. They're light-years away, so when you look at them you're looking years into the past.\n\nSirius, the brightest star in the sky, lies 8.6 light-years from Earth, which means the light you\u2019re seeing left it 8.6 years ago. Put another way, we always see Sirius as it was 8.6 years ago. Deneb, a prominent summer star in the constellation Cygnus, is about 2,500 light-years away. Its twinkling glow was already en route to us while Aristotle was alive.\n\nAnd remember, other galaxies are even more distant. Powerful telescopes like Hubble can detect galaxies whose light has been traveling our way for billions of years. Thus those ethereal Hubble images show us galaxies as they were billions of years ago \u2014 in some cases, from a time before Earth came to be.\n\nIn short, a light-year describes distance only \u2014 but light itself provides a sort of time machine, allowing us to observe the cosmos as it was long ago.\n\nHow do we know the speed of light?\n\nThe crucial insight came from Ole R\u00f8mer, a 17th-century Danish astronomer. During the 1660s, he was studying one of Jupiter\u2019s moons, Io, when he noticed something odd: When Jupiter and Earth were at their greatest distance from one another, Io would slip into Jupiter\u2019s shadow a few minutes later than astronomers predicted. When the two planets were closest together, the event seemed to occur a few minutes early.\n\nR\u00f8mer realized that the delay had nothing to do with Io. Rather, it was an illusion caused by the time it takes for light to span the extra distance when Earth and Jupiter are on opposite sides of the sun. His calculations showed that light travels 131,000 miles a second \u2014 a remarkably good estimate, considering that he was doing this work just 60 years after the invention of the telescope.\n\nWho came up with the term light-year?\n\n\u201cThe concept of light speed as a measurement of distance already happened by the end of the 17th century, following from the discovery of the finiteness of light speed by R\u00f8mer,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Arenou, an astronomer and science historian at the Paris Observatory.\n\nPeople latched on to the idea so quickly that it\u2019s impossible to credit any individual with certainty. Arenou points to one good candidate, however: the English scholar Francis Roberts, who in 1694 mused that \u201cLight takes up more time in travelling from the stars to us, than we in making a West-India Voyage.\u201d\n\nAt first, these ideas were necessarily vague because scientists had only a rough idea of how far away the stars are. The breakthrough moment came in 1838, when German astronomer Friedrich Bessel measured the exact distance to the star 61 Cygni. In describing the huge number he got, Bessel wrote that \u201clight employs 10.3 years to traverse this distance.\u201d That\u2019s the closest thing to a specific moment when the specific concept of the light-year was born.\n\nWithin a couple of decades, the light-year was commonplace in popular science writing. But Arenou says professional astronomers long resisted using the term \u2014 and for a surprising reason. They considered the light-year insufficiently scientific, since it cannot be measured directly.\n\nHow do astronomers measure distances in light-years?\n\nBessel reckoned the distance to 61 Cygni by observing its parallax, the apparent back-and-forth motion in the sky caused by Earth\u2019s motion around the sun.\n\nParallax is still one of astronomers\u2019 most powerful tools for measuring distance. The European Space Agency spent 650 million Euros ($750 million) on the Gaia space telescope, which is currently using parallax to measure the distances to more than a billion stars across our galaxy.\n\nBeyond the Milky Way, where parallaxes are too small even for Gaia to detect, astronomers calculate distances by observing certain types of variable stars or brilliant supernova explosions. Those approaches still rely on parallax measurements as their point of reference, however.\n\nBecause their work is so deeply rooted in parallax, astronomers commonly use a second distance unit, the parsec (\u201cparallax arc-second,\u201d a small angle). One parsec equals 3.26 light-years. Sometimes the parsec is more scientifically relevant, but researchers often switch between the two terms for no obvious reason except style.\n\nUnfortunately, the \u201csec\u201d in parsec sounds like a unit of time, leading to more confusion. In the 1977 movie \"Star Wars: A New Hope,\" Han Solo brags that he \u201cmade the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.\u201d Star Wars fans have tied themselves in knots trying to explain away that obvious goof. Better to stick with the light-year. It\u2019s all the astronomy you need \u2014 and lets you dabble in time travel, too.\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT ASTRONOMY?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Trump, Macron discuss European security at Paris meeting copied!\n\nDuring President Donald Trump's trip to Paris to participate in World War I commemoration ceremonies, he and French President Emmanuel Macron held a bilateral meeting to discuss European security after Macron previously stated that Europe should rely less on the United States.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

While acknowledging the regime's growing economic and political troubles, European governments believe the Iranian leadership remains firmly entrenched and that any attempt to topple the government could produce a worse outcome, the diplomats said.\n\nIn meetings with foreign counterparts, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton and other officials have argued the regime is fragile and increasingly unable to manage a troubled economy and a frustrated population, according to nine foreign diplomats. They cite rising inflation, strikes and sporadic protests as telltale signs of a regime at risk, and that U.S. sanctions on its oil exports \u2014 which came into effect this week \u2014 could deal a crippling blow that will force Tehran to abandon its military adventures in the Middle East or even lose its grip on power.\n\n\"That's their logic,\" said one European diplomat, who disagrees and spoke on condition of anonymity. \"They are saying the regime is going to fall.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have also not detected signs that the Iranian regime is on the verge of unravelling, U.S. officials told NBC News. They see a regime that appears to be just as firmly in control as it has been for years. But they said they do see a country with mounting headaches, and think U.S. sanctions aimed at cutting oil revenues could cause real difficulties for the regime\n\n\"The Trump administration's policies appear designed to add to the political stress which already exists within Iran,\" a former U.S. intelligence official said.\n\nPompeo, Bolton and other top officials publicly insist the administration is not pursuing regime change, and that their policy is merely aimed at changing the regime's behavior.\n\n\"We certainly don't like this regime. It's a deeply hypocritical religious dictatorship that robs its people blind,\" a State Department official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told NBC News. \"Ultimately, it's up to the Iranian people to decide what government they want to live under. ...We want the Iranian people to be successful. We hope they can restore democracy there.\"\n\nBolton has a long track record of public statements calling for weakening the regime and ultimately replacing it. Eight months before he was named by Trump to his current job, Bolton gave the keynote address to the annual convention of the Peoples' Mujahedin of Iran, an anti-regime group known in the Iran as the MEK: \"I have said for the over 10 years that I've been coming to these events that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs' regime in Tehran.\"\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton, left, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attend a meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 11, 2018. Handrew Harrer / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn language reminiscent of Cold War rhetoric, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has made a point of expressing solidarity with the Iranian people and appeared to invite them to oust the clerical leadership.\n\n\"In light of these protests and 40 years of regime tyranny, I have a message for the people of Iran: The United States hears you; the United States supports you; the United States is with you,\" Pompeo said in a July speech before an audience of Iranian-Americans in Los Angeles.\n\n\"And you should know that the United States is not afraid to spread our message on the airwaves and online inside of Iran either,\" said Pompeo, announcing plans to launch a 24-hour Farsi-language channel.\n\nThe administration has launched an aggressive information war against Iran on social media and a virtual embassy site, ridiculing Iranian leaders over corruption, air pollution, water shortages and the repression of dissidents.\n\nHawks close to the administration see many parallels between Iran and the former Soviet Union, and maintain that the current president could play a role similar to former President Ronald Reagan by taking a tough, uncompromising stance toward the regime in Tehran.\n\n\"We don't know that the regime is going to collapse. And we don't know when,\" said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which backed the administration's exit from the Iran nuclear deal. \"But we sense that this regime is a lot weaker than people believe, and that there's something rotten at the heart of the Islamic Republic in the same way that there was something rotten at the heart of the Soviet Union.\"\n\nThe Soviet analogy has sparked an internal debate among conservatives in Washington, with commentator and author Fred Kagan cautioning that the comparison is not precise and that the rulers of Iran could yet hold on to power for some time.\n\nIran's economy has come under serious strain over the past year, partly because of renewed U.S. sanctions and partly because of years of government mismanagement, experts say. The rial has plunged to record lows, losing 70 percent of its value. The IMF predicts the average inflation rate could surpass 34 percent next year, major European firms have pulled out and there are periodic shortages due to panic buying of staples. Teachers and truck drivers have staged strikes and thousands protested in cities across the country in December and January over rising prices and alleged government corruption.\n\nEuropean diplomats and experts say the protests and strikes are focused on specific grievances and have not evolved into a broader political movement.\n\n\"It would take a lot more than what's happening now to produce a collapse or regime change,\" said another European diplomat who asked not to be quoted by name.\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani has warned the country that U.S. sanctions will cause economic pain but vowed his government would resist the pressure.\n\n\"We are in a war situation,\" Rouhani said. \"We are in an economic war situation. We are confronting a bullying enemy. We have to stand to win.\"\n\nUnlike a previous pressure campaign led by the Obama administration between 2012-2015, the United States is leading a unilateral sanctions effort without political support from Europe and with Russia signaling it intends to throw Iran an economic lifeline.\n\nEven if Iran survives the latest squeeze by Washington, the Islamic republic appears to be descending into a long-term decline, said the former U.S. intelligence officer.\n\nThe Islamic republic's \"revolutionary energy has dissipated over the years,\" he said, and the country's youth are acutely aware of a more open, prosperous life elsewhere.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that the end is not necessarily near, in part because the Revolutionary Guard is well-placed to crush opposition and maintain the regime's hold.\n\n\"Although Iran appears increasingly fragile, it does not appear on the verge of a collapse,\" he said. The Revolutionary Guard \"appears to remain well-resourced, organizationally-cohesive, and its units are distributed around the country.\"\n\nAnother former intelligence officer, John McLaughlin, who served as deputy director and acting director of the CIA, said that the regime at the moment faces no organized, unified opposition.\n\n\"Major outbreaks against the government, in 2009 and before have been hampered by factionalism among the protesters and no unified leadership -- making it relatively easy for security forces to squelch opponents,\" McLaughlinsaid.\n\n\"I've seen no evidence that this has changed, so we should not hold our breaths waiting for the great successful uprising along the lines of what we saw in Eastern Europe 30 years ago.\"\n\nA vehicle burns as demonstrators protested high prices and the poor state of the economy in Dorud, in Iran's Lorestan province, on Dec. 30, 2017. SalamPix / Abaca/Sipa USA via AP\n\nGiven the absence of a viable opposition, destabilizing the regime could merely produce an even more aggressive government dominated by the well-armed and well-funded Revolutionary Guard, former officials and European diplomats said.\n\n\"They don't have a plan for what comes next,\" said one diplomat. \"It's very scary.\"\n\nIf the regime did unravel, it's unlikely it would produce a straight-forward transition to a more responsible or more representative government, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"There's just no precedent in the region's history or Iran's history that this all ends all quickly and neatly and to our advantage,\" Maloney said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

I was the guy that found a toilet that was empty of water and spent a lot of time spitting in it to fill it up. It never filled up; I never filled up with grace and love and harmony when I was doing drugs.\n\nBeing on drugs makes you the opposite of everything that you are, in the truth that you own in your heart. You are a child of God, we are all children of God, and we are made in the image of God. We've got fingers and toes and legs and shins and shoulders and shoulder blades and stomachs and endocrine system, intestines, big and little. A heart, two lungs, kidneys. Look how we were put together; it's beautiful.\n\nWe're a lot more than a puzzle, but why mess up the puzzle by doing cocaine or other drugs? Your puzzle's beautiful. There's only one puzzle like you in the world.\n\nI overdosed on cocaine, eventually. I became conscious on the hospital table and there was liquid coming out of my mouth, my nose and my eyes.\n\nWhat happened to me was that, right after I did \"The Buddy Holly Story\" \u2014 a movie where I received an Academy Award nomination \u2014 a fellow who looked like a Beverly Hills cowboy showed up at my door. He told me that he was going to be my manger, and he had a gift for me. It was a blue box from Tiffany's and, in the box, was a rock of cocaine as big as a 50-cent piece and thick, with my initials in it.\n\nHe said, \"Take this. You'll be more creative.\" I tried it, and I got hooked bad. I became a cocaine addict for several years.\n\nI overdosed on cocaine, eventually. I became conscious on the hospital table and there was liquid coming out of my mouth, my nose and my eyes. And they said, \"Well, he had a bunch of cocaine in his pocket.\" Then, when I got out of the hospital, I thought, \"What have I been doing? I've been dancing with the devil in a circle that's very tight and the devil always leads the dance.\"\n\nCocaine is an element and a mineral from Satan; you don't want to dance with Satan like I did. You want to stop the dance, get out and have fun and freedom. So I stopped. That was May the 3rd, 1995.\n\nIt almost killed me, but I had the healing angels of spirituality come around me, and they took me out of it and took me away from it. I realized, after I stopped doing cocaine, how crazy and stupid my thoughts were. I thought I was so creative, but I wasn't.\n\nIf you're doing cocaine now, you gotta stop immediately, no matter what it takes. Don't think that it's something you have to lose; think of it as something you're gonna gain. You're gonna gain yourself back: You're gonna gain your happiness back, your logic back, your mind back, your coordination, everything. You'll trust yourself better.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, when you do drugs like I did, they become the number one relationship in your life; your family and your career run a distant second. You will never be what are supposed to be nor fulfill the purpose that God has for you by doing drugs; you're just signing your death certificate without a pen.\n\nNow I have 25 years sobriety on cocaine, 25 years of freedom. I have a Buseyism for freedom: F-R-E-E-D-O-M stands for \"facing real exciting energy, developing out of miracles.\" The best freedom you can have is knowing that you are a miracle: You were born a miracle and you are a living miracle. So, be yourself, and live in the harmony of what God gave you to be when you were born. Think on that; feel that about yourself. And you won't need to abuse substances or alcohol or needles or pills.\n\nThe best freedom you can have is knowing that you are a miracle: You were born a miracle and you are a living miracle.\n\nGet away from drugs; get away from cocaine; they're not needed. It's better to eat good food, to listen to good music and to understand the spiritual world of everything we are. You can't do that with drugs; they'll take you away from your truth. So stop it, and you'll thank me for it later. (Although, in the beginning, when you stop it, you may hate me. But that's okay; hate is an emotion that comes with growth.)\n\nYou are your own best friend and your own soulmate; it all begins with you and ends with you. But you know what end stands for? E-N-D stands for \"exciting new direction.\" So the end of doing drugs is a whole new rainbow, a place of paradise for your mind, heart, soul and spirit. You just feel better. Doesn't everybody want to feel better?\n\nThat's why I use the word guts; G-U-T-S stand for \"giving up the substance.\" Just do it. It's easy. Forget about it. Move on. All of you are a blessing to yourself and to life and your family. Everything you've done in your life, even though some of it was hard, is good, because you go through it to get better.

Computer expert. Convicted $350 million con man.\n\nRuffo arrived at the courthouse to turn over the electronic monitoring bracelet he had been ordered to wear. His next stop was supposed to be a federal prison in New Jersey to start a 17-year sentence.\n\nBut Ruffo never turned up at the prison. By that evening, he had gained another title: federal fugitive.\n\nRuffo left a trail of wreckage in his wake \u2014 former business partners wiped out, family members, including his wife and mother, forced out of the homes they put up for his bond.\n\nTwenty years later, Ruffo\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nU.S. Marshals are still hunting for him. His former wife is still hurting\u2014and still bitter.\n\n\u201cI cried for a year, every day,\u201d Linda Lausten told NBC News. \u201cI had a rash on my face where the tears came down.\u201d\n\nLausten\u2019s tears have since been replaced by haunting questions.\n\n\u201cI want to face him,\u201d Lausten said. \u201cI want to tell him how bad he hurt his mother and everybody else. I\u2019d like to ask him: \u2018When did you stop loving me? What happened? When did money become so important that you could do this to us?\u2019\u201d\n\nJohn Ruffo, also with his former wife Linda Lausten. Courtesy Linda Lausten\n\nThe man who helped Ruffo pull off the scheme sees his flight from justice in a different light.\n\nEdward Reiners spent nearly nine years in prison for their audacious scam involving a fake Philip Morris research project on smokeless cigarettes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone. God bless him,\u201d Reiners told NBC News. \u201cHe beat the system.\u201d\n\nEven two decades later, the colossal fraud they pulled off seems ripped from a Hollywood script.\n\nThe story begins in 1993 when Ruffo was running a small company based in midtown Manhattan that sold and serviced IBM computers. Reiners was a former Philip Morris employee who had done business with Ruffo as part of his job obtaining computers for the tobacco giant.\n\nThe pair were convinced they could make a boatload playing the stock market, according to Reiners. There was one problem: they weren\u2019t sitting on a pile of cash.\n\nBanks proved a natural target. If they could find a way to secure massive loans, they were confident that they could use the money to make a mint in stocks, repay the banks and keep the leftover cash.\n\nAll they needed was a way to convince financial institutions to loan them millions of dollars.\n\nOver lunch at an Italian restaurant in Manhattan, the plan took shape.\n\nThey would tell banks they were leading an international research program on tobacco alternatives for Phillip Morris that required the purchase of hundreds of computers and the hiring of staff at five offshore locations.\n\nRuffo and Reiners knew that the scheme would only work if they could somehow prevent the banks from contacting Phillip Morris directly.\n\nSo they decided to bill it as an ultra-secret program known only to a few within the company. They even came up with a clandestine-sounding code name \u2013 Project Star.\n\nWhen Reiners pitched executives at their first target, Signet Bank, he required them to sign a confidentiality agreement that barred them from discussing the project with anyone else, even Phillip Morris officials.\n\nWorking in Reiners\u2019 favor was the fact that he had previously done business with Signet when he was still employed by the tobacco company.\n\nThe Signet executives expressed interest but there was a catch. In order to complete the deal, the bank required a so-called incumbency certificate from Phillip Morris giving Reiners the authority to conduct business on the firm\u2019s behalf.\n\nThe document had to include a company seal and executive sign-off.\n\nGetting a corporate stamp was no problem. Reiners and Ruffo found a place in Lower Manhattan that did the job no questions asked.\n\nBut how would they get a signature from a company executive?\n\nThe answer came to them while they were listening to the radio in a taxi as the station announced it was giving a prize to a certain number caller.\n\nPosing as an employee of a radio station, the men phoned a Philip Morris executive and told her she had won a free dinner at a pricey Manhattan restaurant.\n\nThe pair had selected the little-known employee, an assistant corporate secretary named Diane McAdams, from a list of company officers.\n\nMcAdams bought it. She even agreed to sign a release form and send it back to them.\n\nWith McAdams\u2019 signature, Ruffo and Reiners now had their holy grail.\n\nSoon after the bogus certificate was sent to a Signet Bank loan officer, the wire transfer hit Ruffo\u2019s account \u2013 $25 million.\n\nThe loan marked the breaking of the dam. Soon money was flowing in.\n\nIn time, seven foreign and domestic banks had loaned Ruffo and Reiners more than $350 million.\n\nAnd they did so without ever seeing a single computer.\n\nJohn Ruffo was last seen in surveillance footage from an ATM in Queens, New York, on Nov. 9, 1998. U.S. Marshals Service\n\nIn an interview with NBC News last week, Reiners referenced a line that he had delivered to 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft in 1999: \u201cI had a harder time getting a home mortgage than I did getting these loans.\u201d\n\nReiners poured the money into stocks but also into a Trump Tower penthouse apartment. It was unclear where Ruffo was parking his share of the proceeds. \u201cWe were living in a simple little attached house in Queens,\u201d Ruffo\u2019s ex-wife said this week. \u201cHe was not living a millionaire\u2019s lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThe scheme began to unravel in March 1996 when an officer for a Japanese bank grew suspicious of the certificate that Reiners had produced.\n\nThe officer faxed a copy of the certificate to McAdams. According to court records, she replied that same day, saying the document was phony and Reiners isn\u2019t an official at Philip Morris.\n\nThe banks contacted Reiners seeking answers. He proposed a meeting with the financial executives and McAdams herself.\n\nRuffo and Reiners knew they were in a pinch. The only way out of it was to find someone to pose as Diane McAdams.\n\nThey settled on one of Ruffo\u2019s employees, a single-mother from New Jersey named Jody Bachiman.\n\nRuffo and Reiners told Bachiman they were involved in a secret government project with Phillip Morris.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News, Bachiman said she still remembers getting the call from Ruffo telling her about the meeting with the bank executives.\n\n\u201cIt was March 17, 1996, a Sunday, St. Patty\u2019s day,\u201d Bachiman said. \u201cHe said the government project with Philip Morris is in danger and you need to help us.\u201d\n\nReiners and Bachiman met with the bank officers at Philip Morris\u2019 offices in Rye Brook, N.Y.\n\nThe meeting did not go as planned. Reiners and Bachiman left the building in handcuffs after the FBI swooped in.\n\nBy the time Ruffo was arrested in March 1997, the charges against Bachiman had been dropped. Reiners was sentenced to 16 years and 10 months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of money laundering.\n\nRuffo was indicted on 160 counts of bank fraud and money laundering. His bond was set at $10 million.\n\nRuffo convinced six sets of family members to offer up their homes as collateral.\n\nWith his trial just days away, Ruffo pleaded guilty in April 1998. Six months later, he was sentenced to 17 \u00bd years in prison.\n\nAs Ruffo\u2019s attorney remembers it, officers put the convicted fraudster in handcuffs and prepared to lead him out of the courtroom in Richmond, Va.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Whoa, whoa, whoa, there\u2019s a deal in place that would allow my client to self-surrender,\u201d lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman recalled.\n\n\u201cThe judged looked at the prosecutor incredulously and said, \u2018Did you agree to that?\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor said yes, according to Lichtman, and \u201cthey took the handcuffs off him and we got on a plane to New York.\u201d\n\nRuffo\u2019s prison sentence was slated to start in five weeks. His former wife said she noticed nothing unusual during that period.\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 9, 1998, Ruffo dropped off his wife at a train station. It was the last time she ever saw him.\n\nBefore returning home that evening, she received a phone call from the FBI. \u2018They were screaming at me, \u2018Where is John Ruffo?\u2019\u201d Rausten recalled. \u201cThe blood rushed down my body. My face turned to ice.\u201d\n\nShe returned home to find a suicide note that neither she nor the FBI believed told the real story.\n\nRuffo was last caught on camera that afternoon withdrawing money from an ATM machine in Queens.\n\nAfter he vanished, the government put a full-court press on his family members and former colleagues seeking clues to his whereabouts. The relatives who put up their homes, most of whom were in their 70s and 80s, were forced to the streets.\n\nHelen Fahey, the former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, which prosecuted the case, said she didn\u2019t recall the details of Ruffo\u2019s plea deal.\n\nBut she still remembered the scope and absurdity of his scam.\n\n\u201cLeaving aside his disappearance, the story was incredible,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cHe did this huge, huge fraud with this wild scheme. Why all kinds of people didn\u2019t pick up on it, you gotta be kidding me. Where were the accountants? Where was literally anyone with a brain?\u201d\n\nRegarding Ruffo\u2019s bail, Fahey said: \u201cObviously, in retrospect, the government should have screamed bloody murder that it should have been revoked.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Jim Comey, the former FBI director, was the managing assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the Eastern District of Virginia\u2019s Richmond division. Comey, who was not directly involved in the case, declined comment.\n\nTracking down Ruffo is now the responsibility of Chris Leuer and his fellow deputies at the U.S. Marshals Office. Since 2000, Ruffo\u2019s pudgy face has graced the U.S. Marshals\u2019 list of the 15 \u201cmost wanted\u201d fugitives.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not our typical fugitive,\u201d said Leuer. \u201cYou look at our top 15 most wanted, they are murderers and child predators. He\u2019s quite different...I would describe him as a highly intelligent individual who was living a successful life but then got greedy.\u201d\n\nU.S. Marshals Service\n\nLeuer said his office still receives reported sightings of Ruffo on a regular basis. In fact, just a few weeks ago someone reported seeing Ruffo at a store in the state of Washington.\n\nThe marshals confirmed it wasn\u2019t him.\n\nLeuer said Ruffo\u2019s everyman appearance makes tracking him down even more difficult.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a short, heavy-set white guy,\u201d Leuer said. \u201cYou can walk down the street in any busy city in America and probably find two or three people who look like John Ruffo.\u201d\n\nLeuer said Ruffo has something else going for him as well: money. Lots and lots of money.\n\nRuffo is believed to have stashed away at least $8 million.\n\n\u201cThere were millions unaccounted for,\u201d Leuer said. \u201cThat tells me he was was thinking ahead.\u201d\n\nRuffo\u2019s lawyer doubts he\u2019ll ever be captured. \u201cI always think if anyone is willing to stay hidden, they can,\u201d Lichtman said. \"You have to cut off everybody in your life and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nFor Ruffo\u2019s ex-wife, the passage of time has eased her pain. She has since remarried. But she still has clear memories of the period when she and five other family members were forced to leave their homes within two weeks of his disappearance.\n\n\u201cMy poor mother-in-law left everything in her house because she was so overwhelmed,\u201d Linda Lausten said. \u201cHe was not a man because in the end, he punished his mother, my mother, his aunts and uncles. And the government gave no mercy.\u201d\n\nLausten said she still struggles to reconcile the honorable, generous and brilliant man she married with the cruel and conniving fraudster who abandoned his closest relatives.\n\n\u201cEveryone in our family put up their homes. That\u2019s how much we believed in him,\u201d Lausten said, her voice cracking.\n\n\u201cHe was the kind of person who would give a job opportunity to the most undesirable person because they really needed a job. He would literally give money out of his pocket to someone on the street who needed it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to believe that he turned into this monster.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

If the second set of unofficial returns shows a margin 0.25 percent or less, a manual recount is ordered, according to state law.\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed into the close race on Friday, tweeting about both the race between Gillum and DeSantis as well as another close race for U.S. Senate in Florida between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson against Republican Rick Scott, which appears headed for a recount.\n\n\"Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him \"back into play.\" Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he\u2019s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nGillum responded with a tweet of his own: \"What\u2019s embarrassing to democracy is not counting every vote \u2014 and you, of course,\" Gillum wrote. \"Count every vote.\"\n\nAs of Friday evening, DeSantis has 49.6 percent to Gillum\u2019s 49.2 percent, according to NBC News. In the Scott-Nelson race, the gap is 50.1 percent to Nelson\u2019s 49.9 percent.", "City affected by shooting nearly 75% evacuated due to wildfire copied!\n\nMayor Andy Fox says residents who may have been affected by the shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks may now have had to leave their homes due to the growing wildfire.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Courtney Kube and Dan De Luce\n\nThe United States will soon suspend its mission to re-fuel Saudi Arabia\u2019s military aircraft flying in Yemen, according to two U.S. officials and one Senate staffer.\n\nA Senate staffer said the decision is a means to pre-empt a potentially damaging debate and vote in Congress. The political climate on the Hill has turned hostile to Saudi Arabia over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the war in Yemen, the staffer said, adding that some Republican lawmakers who opposed suspending refueling now favor the move.\n\nSaudi Arabia said later Friday, in a statement carried by state-run media, that \u201cin consultation with the United States\u201d it has requested the end of in-flight refueling \u2014 placing the decision for the change on Riyadh rather than Washington.\n\n\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the member countries of the Coalition to Support legitimacy in Yemen, continually pursue improvements to military professionalism and self-sufficiency,\" the Saudi statement said.\n\nThe U.S. military was re-fueling about 20 percent of all Saudi aircraft that fly as part of the operation in Yemen.\n\nBut the U.S. will not curtail intelligence sharing with the coalition, and will continue \u201climited intelligence support in defense of Saudi Arabia,\u201d a defense official said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia\u2019s partner in the coalition fighting in Yemen, is also looking for ways to end its role in the fight in Yemen, according to three officials familiar with the discussions. The Emiratis have asked the Trump administration for help winding down their presence in the war-ravaged country, but have also asked the U.S. to help with a diplomatic process that will eliminate the Houthi missile threat.\n\nThe U.S. maintains that Houthi rebels in Yemen do threaten Saudi Arabia. On Thursday, Houthis fired an anti-ship cruise missile from Yemen into the Red Sea, targeting a Saudi tanker. The Saudi ship was unharmed but a defense official said the action proves the Houthis present a serious threat to Saudi Arabia and to commerce in the busy waterway.\n\nThe U.S. believes Iran is supplying the Houthis with missiles.\n\nThe fighting between the Houthis and the internationally recognized government of Yemen being backed by the Saudi coalition has raged for almost four years, with civilians often caught in the crossfire. A Saudi airstrike on a school bus in August killed over 40 children.\n\nIn the meantime, the country has fallen into the grips of a desperate humanitarian crisis, with three quarters of Yemen's population in need of aid, and one third of the population on the brink of starvation.\n\nLate last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to the fighting.\n\n\"The time is now for the cessation of hostilities, including missile and UAV(unmanned aerial vehicle) strikes from Houthi-controlled areas into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,\" Pompeo said in a statement on Oct. 31.\n\n\"Subsequently, coalition airstrikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen,\" he added.\n\nDeputy State Dept. spokesman Robert Palladino said Friday the U.S. is still pushing for peace.\n\n\"As the Secretary said, we\u2019ve been urging all parties to come to the table and to recognize that there\u2019s no military victory that can be achieved in Yemen. And we continue to call for a cessation of hostilities and for all parties to support United Nations Special Envoy Martin Griffiths in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict,\" Palladino said.\n\nA U.N. official aware of the discussions said that November is still the target for talks between the parties in Yemen although they are allowing some breathing space.\n\nThe U.S. decision to stop the aircraft refueling was first reported by the Washington Post, and comes amid growing criticism of Saudi Arabia's actions in Congress in the wake of the Khashoggi murder. Khashoggi was an outspoken critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and the kingdom has repeatedly shifted its account of what happened to him after he entered its consulate in Turkey last month.\n\nThe New York Times reported Friday that the Trump administration is also looking to impose sanctions against individuals linked to the Khashoggi killing in an apparent bid to stave off congressional action. The sanctions would not target the crown prince, The Times reported.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy James Rainey\n\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif.\u2014 The gunman who killed a dozen people at a Thousand Oaks bar and dance club has been depicted as a troubled loner, tormented by demons from his time as a Marine in Afghanistan.\n\nBut one of Ian David Long\u2019s high school coaches said she saw serious signs of trouble and aggressive behavior in the months before he graduated from Newbury Park High School a decade ago.\n\nOne-time coach Dominique Colell Ballard said Long was a senior sprinter on the track team when he defied her authority during one practice \u2014 barking out repeated profanities \u2014 before grabbing and groping her at another practice.\n\nBallard said her attempt to discipline the teenager by throwing him off the track team was thwarted by other coaches and school administrators, who said they did not want to derail Long\u2019s dream of joining the Marine Corps.\n\n\u201cSo I let him back on the team. And every day after that he would show up with a big old smile on his face. It was very uncomfortable,\u201d said Ballard, now 38 and living in nearby Camarillo. \u201cThe feeling I got was that he felt like he got away with it. He felt like he won.\u201d\n\nIan Long, 28, who is a veteran of the Marines, has been identified as the shooter at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California. via Facebook\n\nBallard said she had returned to her alma mater, Newbury Park High, and was working the part-time job as head girl\u2019s track coach in 2008. She also was responsible for attendance and discipline for both the boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s track teams, when Long joined as a senior. Before that, he had spent his springs playing baseball.\n\nOne afternoon, Long violated a team rule by using profanity. Ballard ordered him to run one mile, the standard punishment for swearing, Ballard recalled. But as he completed each lap, for about a dozen laps, the teenager repeatedly shouted a new round of profanities at his coach.\n\nWith each new broadside, Ballard added another mile to his punishment, until she required a total of 13 miles.\n\n\u201cA couple of the girls on the team heard him and they were just dumbfounded that he would keep doing it,\u201d said Ballard, who is now a mother of two. Ballard said she required the defiant Long to run all, or most, of the distance.\n\nWeeks later at another afternoon practice at the school, which is just 10 minutes from the site of Wednesday\u2019s shooting, Ballard said she was trying to determine who owned a phone that turned up missing. Ballard ran at her, screaming at her to give back his phone.\n\n\u201c'Give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the phone,\u2019 he just kept screaming,\u201d recalled Ballard. Given his aggressive behavior, Ballard told him she would not give him the phone.\n\n\u201cThen he starts grabbing me,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cHe reached around and he had one hand on my stomach and one hand on my butt.\u201d\n\nBallard said she pulled away and immediately told Long he was off the team. But two men who also coached the track team and an assistant principal pleaded with her that Long should not be disciplined, she said. Long brought her flowers, which she called \u201cweird,\u201d telling the 18-year-old he was still not welcome back on the team.\n\nBut on the day of the league track and field finals, Ballard recalled that coaches and an administrator and Long all approached her together and insisted he be allowed to run in the meet. The student had made an isolated mistake and should be given another chance, they told her. An administrator told her that because she was young and attractive it was not surprising that Long did not respect her authority, Ballard recalled.\n\n\u201cI was pressured and guilted and I gave in,\u201d Ballard said.\n\nRequests by NBC News for comment from the school and from one of Ballard\u2019s fellow track coaches were not immediately answered.\n\nShe said she later considered suing the school district for condoning the assault, with no ramifications for Long. But her mother, a long-time art teacher at Newbury Park High, persuaded her daughter that her chances of joining the school\u2019s full-time faculty would be crushed if she pressed her case.\n\nWhen she saw the news Thursday that her former student had shot more a dozen innocents at the Borderline bar, she said she was queasy.\n\n\u201cI felt guilty the whole day,\u201d Ballard said. \u201cI felt like I could have prevented this and it never would have happened.\u201d\n\nLater, after talking to a cousin, she said she came to realize it was not so clear what would have happened if the school had disciplined Long a decade ago. Maybe the attack would have come earlier. Maybe the victims would have been Newbury Park students. She does not know.\n\nBut Ballard, an ice sculptor who founded an all-female ice-carving group named the Chainsaw Chicks, said she is certain of one thing. \u201cThere should be training, and it should be district policy to believe teachers and coaches when they make a real complaint. Besides parents, coaches and teachers are often the first people to see the red flags.\u201d", "Lady Gaga opens up about mental health copied!\n\nAt the SAG-AFTRA Foundation's Patron of the Artists Awards, Lady Gaga gave a 23-minute speech on the importance of mental health, hoping to see more programs devoted to the issue.\n\nRead More", "By Nicole Acevedo, Stephen A.

The first lawsuit was filed in 2012 when Ter\u00e1n ran for the same state office seat. A judge dismissed that suit.\n\n\"I was born in Douglas, Arizona. The courts know it. I had gone through this before. I had to prove it to the same person and she knows it because she was also at the court,\" Ter\u00e1n said.\n\nNovoa, a who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican write-in candidate for Arizona secretary of state, has alleged in the past that immigrants are planning a secret plot \"to take back the Southwest\" for Mexico.\n\nThe challenge to Ter\u00e1n's citizenship is reminiscent of the questioning of Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship before, during and after his presidency.\n\nThe false assertions that he was not born in the U.S. and so was ineligible to be president were pushed by initially by fringe groups but gained ground after being promoted by Donald Trump before Trump was elected president in 2016. Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\n\"This is just an extension of the birther movement,\" said Eduardo Vargas, an assistant professor in the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University in Phoenix.\n\nHe noted that, according to reports, Michelle Obama says in her forthcoming memoir that she will never forgive Trump for endangering her family by pushing the conspiracy theory on Obama's citizenship.\n\n\"The whole [birther] thing was crazy and mean-spirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed,\" wrote Michelle Obama, the Post reported.\n\nTer\u00e1n won her race for state legislator in the 30th Legislative District in Phoenix, which spans from central Phoenix to the west side of Glendale. Over 50 percent of the district's voting age population is Latino.

We ousted Joe Arpaio in 2016,\" Ter\u00e1n told NBC News.\n\nTer\u00e1n is a supporter and activist on progressive policies such as protecting women's reproductive rights, preserving the Affordable Care Act and investing more in public schools.\n\nTer\u00e1n was part of the successful recall of Russell Pearce, who riled the anger of the Latino community with his sponsorship of the infamous \u201cshow me your papers\u201d bill, SB1070.

An estimated 113 million voters, an impressive 49 percent of the electorate, turned out in numbers closer to the 2016 presidential election than the 2014 midterms. Indeed, this is the highest turnout rate for a midterm election since the 1960s.\n\nWith (most) of the ballots counted, it\u2019s clear that the Democrats resoundingly took control of the House of Representatives, seven gubernatorial mansions, over 300 state legislative seats and also added to their ranks in state and local races throughout the country. While Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate and arguably ended the rural Democratic Party, Americans delivered an unmistakable message of disapproval to both Donald Trump and the GOP itself. Fueling that judgment? Millennials, young voters and women.\n\nRepublicans are now left to ask the questions of how and why did this happen? To quote Shakespeare: The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.\n\nFor several years, GOP leaders were warned of a growing problem: Millennials, the largest generation and portion of the workforce in the United States, were not connecting with the Republican Party.\n\nFor several years, GOP leaders were warned of a growing problem: Millennials, the largest generation and portion of the workforce in the United States, were not connecting with the Republican Party. Unless major changes were made, the party was likely to suffer severe consequences at the ballot box.\n\nParty leaders dismissed warnings of the looming demographic crisis. When they were forewarned about how the Women\u2019s March could be as dangerous to Republicans in 2018 as the Tea Party was to Democrats in 2010, they ignored that problem too.\n\nAnd it was these demographics \u2014 young voters (classified as voters 18-29), millennials (people born between 1981-1997) and educated women \u2014 that delivered big for Democrats across the country during Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. While there is still a great deal of data to come, the preliminary data clearly shows that young voters and millennials were particularly impactful. In 2014, just 19.9 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 and 26 percent of Americans under 40 cast their ballots. In the 2018 midterms, an estimated 31 percent of young voters showed up at the polls, a 55 percent increase that was nearly double the overall voter turnout increase. Democrats won the youth vote by 35 points, a significant shift from their 11-point margin in 2014.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats won the overall women\u2019s vote 59 to 40 percent, a substantially larger margin than the 4 points they won it by in 2014. What powered this newfound energy? The most-abundant renewable energy source on the planet: anger.\n\nThe actions, or rather inactions, of the Republican Party to mitigate this surge were abysmal. The party\u2019s attitude toward avoiding calamity was akin to an airline pilot playing a game of chicken with a mountain. They dismissed millennials and young voters using two flawed arguments: They don\u2019t vote and, when they ultimately do, they will have become conservative because they have \u201cresponsibilities\u201d like having a job and paying taxes.\n\nHowever, there were multiple signs that millennials and young voters in particular were going to vote this year. Poll after poll showed an increase in enthusiasm among this sector of the electorate and voter registration data saw a significant uptick in registration.\n\nAs for the claim that millennials will vote Republican as they age and assume responsibilities such as having jobs and paying taxes? It is a bunch of malarkey. The oldest millennials are now 37, have jobs, pay taxes and are busy worrying about how to pay for their kids\u2019 college educations \u2014 and they themselves likely faced or still face massive student debt, which only heightens these concerns. Despite being marginally older, they still feel that the Republican Party does not represent them or their values, so they are continuing to support Democratic candidates.\n\nMaking matters worse, the Republican Party seems to believe that the way to win over millennials is to promote figures like Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens and Tomi Lahren, who are the Baby Boomers\u2019 idea of a millennial Republican. Each of these demagogues believe that the best way to expand the GOP is to shamelessly promote themselves while \u201cowning the libs,\u201d in the process pushing the kinds of divisive rhetoric and ideas that make millennials turn away from the Republican Party in the first place. Even many millennial Republicans find their antics and 280-character-at-a-time, right-wing Twitter infomercials to be intellectually lacking and outright vacuous.\n\nMaking matters worse, the Republican Party seems to believe that the way to win over millennials is to promote figures like Charlie Kirk, Candace Owens and Tomi Lahren.\n\nContinuing to rely on these soapbox orators and their obtuse drivel to bring millennials and young Americans to the GOP will continue to lead to the opposite effect. Instead, these dunces should be cast out in favor of more thoughtful conservatives who have proven they can speak to and work with audiences other than the GOP base.\n\nWhile it is too early to tell if Tuesday\u2019s results are indicative of a durable, long-term shift of the electorate, it certainly makes clear that the Republican Party has a significant amount of work to do when it comes to women and millennial voters.\n\nHowever, based upon comments already made by President Donald Trump and Republican leaders, the prospect of a course correction looks grim. Instead, it seems that the strategy is to become even Trumpier, which the American people, particularly women and millennials, have already made clear is not their cup of tea. Although Trump celebrated the outcome of the midterms, he could potentially be headed for another electoral disaster in 2020. And if that happens, Republican leaders will only have themselves to blame.", "By Reynaldo Leanos, Jr.\n\nDaniel Fernandez, 21, an Army Specialist Fourth Class was on a mission in Vietnam when he and others were trying to save a wounded soldier.

The bulk of those offered come directly from colleges and universities, rather than from competitive national pools. This increases the chances that applicants might receive scholarships to attend these schools, whether they are undergraduate, graduate or professional students.\n\nOther scholarships found in TFS come from big companies; for example, PepsiCo offers the Cesar Chavez Latino Scholarship, and other organizations like the Esperanza Education Fund provide scholarships and mentorships to local immigrant students.\n\n\u201cTFS Scholarships was inspired by my own father\u2019s experience as an inner-city high school principal, and grew out of the realization that more could be done to support students searching for college scholarships,\u201d said TFS president Richard Sorensen, who founded it in 1988. TFS is currently sponsored by Wells Fargo.\n\nKelsey Alamillo, 17, a freshman at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, CA, heard about the website from one of her family members.\n\n\u201cMy T\u00eda Cindy sent me a link to this website,\u201d said Alamillo, adding that her aunt told her, \u201cthis will definitely help your family out.\"\n\nKelsey Amarillo, 17, is a freshman at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, CA. She has applied to various scholarships on the TFS website to help pay for college. Edward Ortega\n\nAlamillo, who plans to major in business and minor in dance, applied about a month ago to about 6 scholarships related to the fields she's interested in. Now she's waiting to hear. She wishes she had known about the database sooner, but is still optimistic about her chances.\n\n\u201cThe process is slightly difficult, but the way I see it is that this is like a part-time job,\u201d said the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants about the scholarship application process. She enjoyed writing the essays.\n\n\u201cHard work can pay off,\" she said about the process. \" Even the small ones count. It doesn\u2019t matter if it is $10,000 or $1,000 or $500. It all adds up.\u201d\n\nAlamillo has recommended the website to her friends and other family members, and in the meantime awaits news about her applications in January. Her advice to other Latino students is to apply early and often, and to find scholarships that align with their interests.\n\nSome databases like TFS list scholarships that are available for DACA students, for example, or veterans.\n\nApart from TFT, there are other websites and organizations that list scholarship opportunities, such as the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, as well as Big Future, which is the College Board's scholarship aggregator. CareerOneStop is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nExcelencia in Education's Santiago said her organization is pushing for institutions and funders to have more direct contact with community-based organizations, which have earned the \u201cconfianza\u201d or trust, of Latino families and can guide them and provide them with the resources needed to find and apply for scholarships and financial aid.\n\n\u201cThe ability to make college seem affordable is a messaging piece that is then reinforced with scholarships that can be pieced together to make it affordable,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cAnd that combined message is not one that is often shared. So applying for a $500 scholarship doesn\u2019t seem like a lot \u2014 but $500 can pay for books, so you have to make it tangible.\u201d\n\nIdeally, families should start to look into scholarship opportunities when students enter high school so that they can become familiar with the process and what is available. However, many college seniors may only be finding out now about opportunities, and there is still time to apply.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It also argues that the provision creates an undue burden to abortion access.\n\nIf the ban takes effect Jan. 1 as scheduled, doctors would have to be physically present when a woman takes medication to end her pregnancy, the group contends.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights filed its lawsuit Thursday on behalf of Trust Women Wichita, which has operated a clinic offering reproductive health care, including abortions, since 2013.\n\n\"This ban hurts Kansas women by mandating that they must travel farther and pay more in gas, child care, lost wages and lodging to access necessary medical care,\" Julie Burkhart, chief executive officer of Trust Women, said in a news release. \"Medication abortion is safe whether provided in person or by telemedicine.\"\n\nThe Kansas attorney general's office, which represents the state in lawsuits, did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.\n\nThe complaint, filed in Kansas District Court in Shawnee County, argues that 97 percent of Kansas counties in 2014 were without a single clinic that provides abortions, and that more than half of Kansas women live in those counties. The five clinics in Kansas that offer abortion services are all in Wichita or suburban Kansas City.\n\nTrust Women recently began providing abortions via telemedicine to expand access to the clinic's services, according to the lawsuit. Before Trust Women introduced telemedicine, the clinic was able to provide abortion care only two days a week because its physicians had to travel to Wichita. Telemedicine allowed it to offer the service on additional weekdays and Saturdays.\n\nThe Kansas Telemedicine Act requires insurance companies in Kansas to cover health care services provided through telemedicine if insurance already covers the services during personal visits to a doctor. The law aims to improve access to health care in underserved communities and rural areas.\n\nAbortion opponents insisted that the telemedicine bill include language forbidding abortion by telemedicine. Lawmakers then added a \"non-severability\" clause aimed at ensuring that the entire law is nullified if the abortion ban is struck down. The lawsuit argues that it's ultimately up to the courts, not the Legislature, to decide whether a section of the legislation can be severed.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Of sons who lived at least to the age of 45, those in the unlucky first group had a 9 percent higher probability of dying in any given year than those in the second group, and an 11 percent higher probability of dying than sons fathered by men who hadn\u2019t been captured. The early deaths were caused mostly by stroke and cancer, according to the researchers.\n\nPrevious studies turned up similar cases in which people whose parents survived a harrowing ordeal had an unusually high risk of health problems. For example, it\u2019s well documented that the offspring of survivors of the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-45 \u2014 In which German forces cut off food supplies to the Netherlands near the end of World War II \u2014 experienced high rates of diabetes, schizophrenia and other chronic ailments.\n\nIn recent years scientists have started to piece together how this might happen. It\u2019s not that ordeals like starvation changed these people\u2019s genomes (the sum total of a person\u2019s DNA). Rather, it\u2019s that the traumatic events triggered chemical changes in certain compounds attached to DNA, which collectively are known as the epigenome. Scientists think some of these epigenetic changes, which affect which genes are activated and which are silenced, could be passed on to the next generation from the mother or father.\n\nRandy Jirtle, an epigeneticist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, offers a helpful analogy: An individual\u2019s genome is like computer hardware, while the epigenome is like software that tells the hardware what to do. If the software has been corrupted, the hardware doesn\u2019t produce the expected result.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the Civil War POWs\u2019 hardships triggered epigenetic changes to the Y chromosomes in the men\u2019s sperm, as only the men\u2019s sons and not their daughters had shortened lifespans. So far, the evidence for this epigenetic link is indirect. Costa and her team won\u2019t know for certain that this is the correct explanation until they examine the genes of the living descendants of the sons, in whom traces of the trauma might still linger.\n\nChanging an epigenetic legacy\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly clear why many sons of POWs lived normal lifespans while others died young, but indirect evidence suggests that for some it might be a matter of timing. The sons who were born toward the end of the year fared better than those born in springtime. Costa thinks that may be because their mothers had plenty to eat during the critical months of pregnancy, which for those sons would have been during the summertime \u2014 when food was bountiful.\n\nStudies in animals have shown that a mother\u2019s diet can protect her offspring from harmful epigenetic marks. The new findings indicate that the same could hold true for people, Jirtle says.\n\n\u201cCan we do anything to make our life and the lives of our children better, or are we just stuck with these epigenetic programs that are altered for generation upon generation?\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a tantalizing possibility.\u201d\n\nOf course, encouraging people to get enough to eat during pregnancy \u201cis not a particularly striking new type of recommendation,\u201d says Jean-Pierre Issa, a medical oncologist at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia.\n\nIssa looks forward to a time when epigenetics can bring more specific guidance on good nutrition and other health-promoting tools. Eventually, he said, doctors may be able to help their patients protect their epigenomes by getting plenty of food during certain stages of life while restricting what they eat during others. It might even be possible to offer a blood test that would reveal epigenetic problems, which could then be corrected with medication, exercise or better nutrition.\n\n\u201cYou can think about this as a 23andMe for the epigenome,\u201d he says. \u201cThe bottom line is that there is promise, but there\u2019s a lot more work to be done.\u201d\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT GENETICS?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "More than 1,000 unaccounted for in Northern California wildfire as death toll grows to 71", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

White\n\nThe market survived the midterms, and Wall Street seemed reassured that a divided Congress is, at the very least, not a worst-case-scenario for stocks. And after a midterm election cycle marked by acrimony, economists and market analysts are looking to one of the few places on which a divided Congress could find common ground: Making it easier for Americans to save for retirement.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, there\u2019s no reason for business or markets to worry particularly about this Congress,\u201d said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel think tank in Brussels and the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cI view it as generally benign for the business environment, but with a number of question marks that remain,\" he said, particularly with regard to trade.\n\nA pair of bills advancing in the Senate and House \u2014 respectively, the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act of 2018 and the Family Savings Act of 2018 \u2014 could be combined to create legislation that would streamline the rules around defined-contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, the default retirement savings vehicle for American workers today. The hope is that new legislation will make it easier for businesses, especially small businesses, to set up and administer retirement plans for their workers.\n\nBrian Kropp, group vice president of Gartner\u2019s HR practice, said retirement savings is a safe area of compromise for both political parties because it satisfies the goals of key constituencies in each. \u201cFrom a Democratic perspective, it creates more opportunities for employees to invest. From a Republican perspective, it\u2019s of interest because it\u2019s able to put more money into the stock market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cClearly, Americans are dramatically underfunded in terms of their retirement overall. I think anything that would encourage additional saving and investing is a good thing,\u201d said Scott Wren, managing director and senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\n\u201cThere are some interesting ideas out there in terms of universal IRAs that would remove the link between who you work for and your options for retirement,\u201d said Robert Schmansky, president of Clear Financial Advisors. \u201cI think we need to go in that direction to allow more options for people to work with providers that serve their individual needs best,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is precedent for this on which lawmakers could build in other categories of savings vehicles, Schmansky said. \u201cWe already have a model for this with HSAs where individuals can move their plans to a provider of their choice.\"\n\nSome economists expressed concern, though, that workers at the lower end of the wage spectrum might not be able to reap the benefits conferred by new retirement-plan legislation. \u201cFar too many people live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Wren said.\n\n\u201cIn most cases the employees who are going to benefit are going to be full-time employees who have enough to set aside for retirement,\u201d Kropp said, but he added that the tight labor market had employers even in lower-wage sectors searching for ways to attract workers.\n\nIn this case, more portable, flexible retirement accounts could be a boon, he said. \u201cFor lower wage employees, you might see lump sum payments of, say, $500 into IRAs or other retirement vehicles to compete for talent,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough $500 isn\u2019t going to be much by itself, Kropp expressed optimism that it would still create a base on which lower-paid workers could build. \u201cPart of the hope is that it starts to build a habit and it grows through time. From that perspective, it\u2019s an incentive to try to make that happen,\u201d he said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Erik Ortiz\n\nA typical wildfire season in California might begin in mid-summer and run through early autumn.\n\nNot this year. Maybe not anymore.\n\nThe state was already besieged by two major wildfires in the first week of July, and is currently grappling with three intense infernos: the Camp Fire, north of Sacramento, and the Woolsey and Hill fires, west of Los Angeles.\n\nWith so much at stake \u2014 people's lives, tens of thousands of homes and entire communities \u2014 experts are taking note of this new pattern that is emerging when it comes to wildfires in the state.\n\nAnd it's poised to worsen under a changing climate.\n\n\"It's not so much things are worse because it has warmed a couple degrees because of climate change,\" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \"It's really a cumulative effect in that it's changing the landscape. You're getting longer periods of the year when you get these fires. We're literally burning the candle at both ends.\"\n\nSwain said California's fire season doesn't peak during the summer, as one might assume, but rather in September and early October, which follow the dry season and come before the rainier one \u2014 a product of its Mediterranean climate.\n\nIn more recent years, the drought that plagued large swaths of California essentially turned the state into a tinder box. Although a state of emergency was largely lifted for the drought in April 2017, rainfall remained well below average last winter and again this autumn, Swain said.\n\nCombine that with how California in July saw its hottest month ever recorded with a string of record-breaking heat waves, Swain said vegetation in the state has been left \"tinder, tinder dry.\"\n\n\"Climate change is affecting how dry the vegetation is,\" he added, \"and that affects how fast the fire spreads.\"\n\nAdding fuel to the fire are the Santa Ana winds, which bring hot, extremely dry air from inland down into the coastal regions. The winds can wreak havoc in the fall.\n\nOn Friday, they were forecast to gust up to 50 miles per hour in the valley and coastal areas of Southern California, where the Woolsey Fire forced large areas of the city of Malibu to evacuate in the morning and led the Hill Fire to consume more than 10,000 acres and close a section of the 101 Freeway.\n\nA statue is seen on a smouldering property as the Camp fire tears through Paradise, California on Nov. 8, 2018. Josh Edelson / AFP - Getty Images\n\nBut most shocking, Swain said, has been the fury of the fast-moving Camp Fire in Butte County, which quadrupled in size by Friday morning as it scorched at least 8,000 acres. Officials said the town of Paradise, with a population of almost 27,000, appeared to be all but destroyed, with cars and homes left smoldering in an apocalyptic landscape.\n\n\"I'm not sure I've heard of something like that happening before,\" Swain said.\n\nFive people were found dead in their vehicles in Paradise, officials said Friday. Due to the severity of the burns, identifications were not immediately made.\n\nNBC News meteorologist Kathryn Prociv said it's unusual for such a wildfire to persist in Northern California at a time of year when storms off the Pacific Ocean usually temper those conditions.\n\nBut all bets are off after the lines have blurred for just how long the fire season lasts.\n\n\"Is this the new normal? It very well could be with the confluence of drier conditions and warmer conditions,\" Prociv said.\n\nOctober has also been the deadliest month for wildfires in the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. Last year, the Tubbs Fire turned homes in the heart of Northern California's bucolic wine country into ash-covered shells and killed more than 20 people.\n\nProciv said wildfires that hit during the summer typically affect forest areas with sparser populations. But these fires in later autumn, driven by the Santa Ana winds, pop up closer to larger population centers \u2014 and put more people in harm's way.\n\nIn turn, that makes them financially costlier as well. Property damage claims from the deadly wildfires in October 2017 exceeded $3.3 billion, state officials said.\n\nSwain said officials need to start reexamining how and where homes are built in areas susceptible to wildfires.\n\n\"Many times these homes are in desirable places because you're surrounded by pretty views,\" Swain said. \"But they're also high-risk areas, so these are decisions that we have to make \u2014 whether it's wildfires or floods or storm surges \u2014 do we keep rebuilding in these same places?\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

It\u2019s real, but often invisible, according to writer Maddie Eisenhart.\n\nWhether it\u2019s grocery shopping, managing kids or holiday shopping, emotional labor is all the work that often goes unappreciated in a relationship, explains Eisenhart, an executive and blogger at A Practical Wedding.\n\n\u201cEssentially, to me, emotional labor is all of the invisible work that is done in managing a household in a relationship,\u201d Eisenhart tells NBC News Better.\n\nEisenhart, 32, and her husband Michael, 35, have been together for 15 years. The San Francisco couple have an 18 month old son, work full time jobs, and share most of their domestic responsibilities. But for a long time, recalls Eisenhart, she did most of the emotional labor in their relationship.\n\n\u201cAt the very least, I mostly just felt really stressed out and burned out and resentful, because I was doing all of this work, and it was going largely unseen and unappreciated, but it\u2019s been a process,\u201d she says.\n\nWhile her husband is a great guy, Eisenhart says, it was a struggle to get him to take on his fair share of emotional labor. Here\u2019s how she did it.\n\nSTEP #1: MAKE IT VISIBLE\n\nEisenhart decided to start making all of her invisible emotional labor visible.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t see the things that you\u2019re doing, they have no way of knowing what\u2019s being done, they have no way of knowing what needs to be done,\u201d Eisenhart says.\n\nSo she purchased a white board and hung it on her refrigerator. Every day, she wrote down all the things that needed to be done.\n\n\u201cWhat I did was I put it all on the white board, and then I asked him to take ownership,\u201d Eisenhart said. \u201cI said \u2018Here are the 20 things that we need to take care of, and which do you want to do?\u2019 And when he had the list, it made it very difficult for him to turn around and say, \u2018You should do all of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe says it was important for her husband to be able to see the list of to-do\u2019s she kept in her head.\n\n\u201cPreviously, I just think he hadn\u2019t been aware of how much labor I was doing,\u201d she says.\n\nSTEP #2: GET COMFORTABLE WITH BEING UNCOMFORTABLE\n\nFor Eisenhart, a big struggle with getting her partner to take on more responsibility was learning to stand her ground.\n\n\u201cAsking more of your relationship often inherently means that you\u2019re going to get some pushback,\u201d Eisenhart says.\n\nThere were days, Eisenhart recalls, when they argued, but she learned not to give in.\n\n\u201cPart of this journey has just been accepting that it\u2019s ok to add a bit of tension to my relationship if it\u2019s ultimately going to make my marriage better,\u201d she says.\n\nShe says she also needed to get comfortable with delegating effectively. For example, she says, when you need your partner to do something, don\u2019t ask them to do it. Instead, phrase the question as a statement beginning with \u201cI need you to\u2026\u201d She says it\u2019s also important to avoid criticism.\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s going to want to respond to wanting to make my life better more than a criticism of what he\u2019s not doing or a statement of what needs to be done,\u201d Eisenhart explains.\n\nSTEP #3: REFUSE TO BE THE MIDDLE MAN (OR WOMAN)\n\nOften, the partner who shoulders most of the emotional labor inadvertently becomes the middle man, according to Eisenhart.\n\nFor example, Eisenhart hired a dog walker to take the family dog out in the afternoons. Often, on days when her husband would be home early, he would ask her to cancel with the dog walker.\n\nEisenhart says she accepted this responsibility for months. \u201cI was like \u2018Sure I\u2019ll be the middle man.\u2019 Until, one day, I was like, Oh, there is no reason for this to be the case.\u201d\n\nEisenhart says she sent her husband the dog walker\u2019s number and told him to cancel on his own.\n\n\u201cMy husband is an engineer. He works in high-level corporate environments all day long. He can handle texting a dog walker,\u201d she says.\n\nSTEP #4: LOWER YOUR STANDARDS\n\nYou want the dishes organized a certain way, the toilet cleaned a certain way, the bed made a certain way, but your partner has their own way of doing these tasks. Demanding they meet your standards only makes more work for you, says Eisenhart, and isn\u2019t fair to your partner.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to ask my partner to be an equal partner in our marriage, that means that to an extent his standards need to be as valid as my own, which means that sometimes I just have to accept that things are getting done differently than I would do them,\u201d she says\n\nSTEP #5: CALL OUT THE INJUSTICE\n\nIf all else fails and your partner still doesn\u2019t shoulder their fair share of emotional labor, you may have to simply call out the unfairness, says Eisenhart.\n\n\u201cSometimes, calling it out really plainly is a way to snap him into attention and realize that we\u2019ve been falling into a sort of very gender stereotype trap,\u201d she says.\n\nSTEP #6: UNDERSTAND NO RELATIONSHIP IS PERFECT\n\nEisenhart says she isn\u2019t on a mission to make her marriage perfect. Rather, she sees it as a road to progress with some bumps along the way.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of maintaining peace in our marriage is that I am not trying to solve all of the inequities in our relationship all at once, and I\u2019m also not asking for him to get it right every single time,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to see that he has heard most of what I\u2019m saying and is taking active measures to move forward.\u201d\n\nSTEP #7: ENJOY THE BENEFITS\n\nSince making her emotional labor more visible, Eisenhart says her husband has taken on a lot more responsibilities on his own.\n\n\u201cI mean now, frankly, he\u2019s kind of obnoxious,\u201d she says with a laugh, \u201cbecause he\u2019s appointed himself \u2018Cleaner of the Cleanliness,\u2019 and comes with a side of smug I was not expecting.\u201d\n\nShe says her husband\u2019s efforts to do more have \u201cdramatically improved our relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think part of that is because I am feeling much more gratitude toward my partner and much less resentful,\u201d Eisenhart says, \u201cand it is much nicer when I feel like I have a true partnership \u2014 like we are really sharing in our relationship management.\u201d\n\nMORE FROM BETTER\n\nWant more tips like these?

Kemp has 50.3 percent of the vote, or 1,979,913 votes, Abrams has 48.7 percent, or 1,910,853 votes, and a third-party Libertarian candidate has 0.9 percent, or 37,094 votes, according to NBC News.\n\nIf the margin is less than 1 percent between the top two candidates, a candidate may request a recount. Another possibility is that if the counting of additional votes pushed Kemp's percentage below 50 percent, a runoff between Kemp and Abrams would take place next month.\n\nAbrams has not conceded and her campaign said Friday they were filing additional litigation related to absentee ballots. Already, the campaign has gone to court to try to get certain ballots counted and related election documents preserved.\n\nTrump also sarcastically suggested the ongoing vote counts in Georgia and Florida is the work of the Russians.\n\n\"Let's blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!\" Trump tweeted, two days after a boastful Wednesday press conference in which the president argued that he had personally staved off a blue wave and boosted his party's Senate gains.\n\nIn the close Georgia governor's race, the Abrams campaign said there is no way for Kemp to know how many outstanding ballots are left, because of incoming ballots from military overseas and provisional ballots.\n\nVoters who cast a provisional ballot due to registration problems have until Friday afternoon to provide additional verification \u2014 like a marriage certificate to clear up a name change on a ballot, for instance \u2014 to get those ballots counted.\n\nKemp said Thursday that even if Abrams received \"100 percent\" of the remaining provisional ballots, she could not close the margin.\n\n\"The votes are not there for her,\" Kemp said. \"I certainly respect the hard-fought race that she ran.

When pressed for evidence of impropriety, he pointed to the past.\n\n\"Go down and see what happened over the last period of time, 10 years. Take a look at Broward County,\" he said.\n\nMoments later, as the president was en route to Paris for a meeting with world leaders, he tweeted, \"You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia \u2014 but the Election was on Tuesday?\"\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, he said, \"Don't worry, Florida \u2014 I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\" \u2014 again without providing evidence of any such malfeasance.\n\nScott's lead in the Senate contest was reduced to just 15,000 votes over Nelson as of Friday, setting up the possibility of a recount. It's unclear what role the federal government would play at this point in the regular vote counting process. Florida counties have a deadline of noon Saturday to deliver the first set of \"unofficial returns\" to the secretary of state after an election \u2014 a count that would occur even if the race wasn't close.\n\nTrump on Friday said Scott \"won by a comfortable margin\" before suggesting without evidence that Democrats were committing fraud in the election.\n\n\"Every couple of hours, it goes down a little bit,\" Trump said of Scott's margin.\n\nLater Friday, Trump continued to suggest without evidence that there was something nefarious happening in the two counties still counting votes.\n\n\"Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they 'found' many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. 'The Broward Effect.' How come they never find Republican votes?\" Trump tweeted.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet calling the ongoing vote counting process \"an embarrassment to our Country,\" he wrongly claimed Nelson conceded his race.\n\nNelson never conceded the race, and it is not uncommon for election officials to continue counting ballots, such as mail-in and provisional, following Election Day.\n\nScott, the state's governor, filed a lawsuit Thursday accusing Democrats in Broward and Palm Beach counties of \"rampant fraud\" and of trying to steal the election \u2014 allegations for which he offered no proof.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee also joined Scott on Thursday to file suit against both Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes and Palm Beach Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher.\n\nScott alleges that the supervisors have violated federal and state laws by failing to provide information to officials. Scott also had harsh words for Nelson, who hired a lawyer after election night. Scott accused Nelson of bringing in an attorney to \"try to steal the election and try to thwart the will of the voters of Florida.\"\n\nScott declared victory Tuesday night, but the race is still too close to call, according to NBC News.\n\nTrump later weighed in, tweeting Thursday evening: \u201cLaw Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!\u201d\n\nAt the press conference on Thursday, Scott told reporters that he was asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, or FDLE, to investigate Democrats trying to \"steal\" this election in Broward and Palm Beach Counties.\n\nA spokesman for the FDLE told NBC News Friday morning that the agency was investigating after the governor\u2019s request, but later, the spokesman said they are \"not actively investigating\" right now. After Scott's news conference, the agency said, it took the step of consulting with the Department of State and found no instances of criminal activity or fraud.\n\nShould criminal activity or fraudulent activities become apparent and credible, the FDLE will again work with the DoS and investigate, the spokesman told NBC News.\n\nBucher, the Palm Beach County supervisor of elections, responded to Scott on Friday, saying she's disappointed that he is interfering with the democratic process.\n\n\"I just felt it very unfortunate that some of the highest elected officials in our country are trying to disrupt our democracy because they don't like the demographics of our voters,\" she said.\n\n\"I would wish that they would allow us to continue to count the ballots, we're just doing our job in accordance with law,\" she added.\n\nNelson accused Scott of \"trying to stop all the votes from being counted\" and \"impeding the democratic process\" in a statement on Friday.\n\n\"You can see this from his irresponsible, unethical and unprecedented press statement last night that he\u2019s worried and he\u2019s desperate,\" Nelson said in the statement. \"Scott is abusing the full force of his public office as governor to stop a complete and accurate counting of all the votes in Florida - which would determine whether he wins or loses.\"\n\nIn a call with reporters Thursday, Nelson's lawyer, Marc Elias, said that the race currently stands as a \"jump ball\" as counties around the state canvass their votes, but he believes Nelson will prevail in the end. He reiterated that sentiment on a second call Friday with reporters, while also hitting back at Scott.\n\n\"It is not appropriate for the governor of any state to suggest that he\u2019s going to use the power of the state to interject,\" Elias said.\n\nThe deadline for all 67 Florida counties to submit their first set of unofficial returns is Saturday at noon ET, according to the secretary of state's office.\n\nAli Vitali reported from Tallahassee, and Dartunorro Clark reported from New York.", "By Kristina Puga\n\nThere are few who know the extreme disparities between the U.S. and Central America like 29-year-old Steven Levy.\n\nHis mother immigrated to Los Angeles from the infamously dangerous Los Amates, El Salvador in 1979. A decade later, Levy was born, the youngest of five brothers \u2014 and the only one born on U.S. soil.\n\nHe was also the one to give birth to a legacy of lasting change.\n\nOne year ago, he founded Academia de F\u00fatbol Juvenil Amatense (AFJA) \u2014 a Los Angeles based non-profit that recycles soccer equipment throughout the U.S. and establishes community-based soccer academies for youth, ages 5-19.\n\nFounder Steven and mother Maria at his graduation from USC. Ron Sosa / AFJA\n\nBrian Aguilar, of Guatemalan heritage and Levy\u2019s college friend, heard about the project and was inspired to make a short documentary about it called, \u201cEl Poder del Juego\u201d (\u201cThe Power of Play\u201d). It will be screening at the Central American International Film Festival this Saturday, November 10, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe idea for AFJA was conceived because Levy\u2019s mom would send him to her hometown, a town made up of about 150 homes in the northern part of El Salvador, during summer vacations, while his school friends were being sent to summer camp. This allowed Levy to witness firsthand the life his mother had left behind.\n\n\u201cI saw kids, already at 10, working in agriculture and doing hard work,\u201d said Levy about the impoverished youth in El Salvador, who often only had one pair of worn shoes, if that.\n\n\u201cI would communicate with the kids, and make friends, through soccer,\" said Levy. \"I would start leaving stuff behind like soccer balls, equipment, and toys, because I saw the disparity between my friends here and there.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2015. Levy graduated from the University of Southern California, and he now works full-time in IT at an LA-area hospital. However, despite his average American life, with everyday comforts like clean drinking water and takeout food, the image of his young friends in El Salvador \u2014 without those same luxuries \u2014 never left him.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Levy decided to start a Go Fund Me with a $500 goal, which was quickly surpassed.\n\nDonations collected are sorted out at AFJA HQ in Lynwood, CA. Courtesy AFJA\n\n\u201cI was just going to buy new gear, and bring it to the kids, but within two weeks we surpassed the goal,\u201d Levy told NBC News. \u201cAfter I went to El Salvador and took videos and photos, then it really took off. People saw the joy in the kids\u2019 faces. We captured the moment of some of these kids receiving their first shoes.\u201d\n\nThe original idea was to give these hard-working youth an outlet to play, but it grew to become an academy for them to also be future leaders in their towns. There are three requirements for eligibility, including academic, attendance, and community service. One of their most important duties is \u201cclean up days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe coaches, teachers and kids in the community get together to pick up the trash in the neighborhood,\u201d Levy explained. \u201cYou know we\u2019re having impact when a 5-year-old sees an adult throw a wrapper on the ground and says, \u2018Hey, pick that up.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother serious problem Levy has witnessed is the water, which is contaminated with dangerous levels of lead.\n\n\u201cThe same water kids were taking to practice is contaminated. One of the moms told us she had to take her 10-year-old to dialysis, because of the level of contamination in the water,\u201d said Levy. \u201cWe partnered with another nonprofit called La Mission por Vida, (launching a Giving Tuesday campaign on the 27th of this month) which provides water filters for the whole community.\u201d\n\nLevy said he could not have done this all without the help of his mom, who is the program\u2019s director, residing back in El Salvador, as well as the help of other family members and some of the children's parents. Thanks to the group effort, the organization now serves 122 youth in Los Amates and Ateos, El Salvador, and there are plans to start a chapter in Guatemala in January.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Levy said it really hits home for him to see Central American children in the news, detained by immigration authorities. But he understands why they try to come. It's out of desperation.\n\n\u201cHere we are with the same kids, and what they look like when someone believes in them,\u201d he said.\n\nLevy said he's most proud that he's making his mother proud.\n\n\"She came to the U.S., worked the jobs nobody wanted to work,\" said Levy. \"My brothers joined the military, and I went to college. [Los Amates] is where my mom comes from, the school she went to still has the bullet holes from the civil war.\"\n\n\"With the academy,\" said Levy, \"I want to build a sustainable model to be able to use soccer as a vehicle for social change.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Overall, just under 9 percent of people met the cutoff.\n\n\u201cGender differences were smaller than previously theorized, with 10.3 percent of men and 7 percent of women endorsing clinically relevant levels of distress and/or impairment associated with difficulty controlling sexual feelings, urges, and behavior,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThat would make compulsive sexual behavior problems more common than major depression, which affects 5 percent of people. Doctors may want to keep an eye out for the problem, they said.\n\n\u201cHealth care professionals should be alert to the high number of people who are distressed about their sexual behavior, carefully assess the nature of the problem within its sociocultural context, and find appropriate treatments for both men and women,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the problem is exaggerated, and it could be the questionnaire labeled people with mild problems as having a disorder, they said. Psychiatrists have disagreed on whether it\u2019s a true disorder. They debated whether to include sex addiction as a diagnosis in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), and opted not to.\n\nAnd many agree people who claim they have a psychological problem with their sexual feelings are just making excuses for bad behavior.\n\n\u201cI am not sure when being a selfish, misogynistic jerk became a medical disorder,\u201d David J. Ley, a clinical psychologist in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the author of \"The Myth of Sex Addiction\u201d, told NBC News in 2017.\n\n\u201cThis is a concept that has been used to explain selfish, powerful, wealthy men engaging in irresponsible impulsive sexual behavior for a long time,\u201d Ley said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Sears and Kmart, which are owned by the same holding company, are preparing to close 188 stores by the end of the year and 40 more by February in a bid to reorganize and revive the brands.\n\nOnline retailers are making double digit gains this year, but traditional retail is still expected to be a \u201cbright spot\u201d this holiday season, said Andrew Lipsman, principal analyst at eMarketer. Retailers are expected to see a 4.4 percent increase in sales, accounting for $878.38 billion in holiday receipts, according to the research.\n\nThat growth is being fueled by remodeled stores, streamlined checkouts, and the option to buy online and pick up an item in-store, Lipsman said.\n\nRetailers and delivery services are already staffing up with seasonal hires to ensure they\u2019re ready to meet the holiday demand, but they are competing in the tightest labor market in nearly 50 years.\n\nTarget is hiring 120,000 seasonal employees, the largest ever hiring announcement from a brick-and-mortar retailer, according to global staffing company Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

It was designed to provide legal protections to adoption agencies that cite faith-based reasons for refusing to place children in homes that violate their religious beliefs.\n\nThe debate over the law centered on agencies that won\u2019t place children in LGBTQ foster homes. The agencies handle those adoptions of abused and neglected children for the state Department for Children and Families. Supporters saw it as a religious liberties measure.\n\nKelly, a veteran state senator from Topeka, voted against what she called \u201cthe adoption discrimination\u201d measure when the Republican-controlled Legislature approved it in May.

An adoption agency cannot be denied a license or state reimbursement for a placement, or blocked from participating in DCF programs, solely because of its beliefs.\n\nTom Witt, Equality Kansas\u2019 executive director, said the law so clearly allows adoption agencies to engage in discrimination while receiving tax dollars that the state shouldn\u2019t enforce it.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of unconstitutional laws on the books that aren\u2019t being enforced,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThe (state\u2019s same-sex) marriage ban comes to mind.\u201d\n\nBut Weber said: \u201cWe were very careful in drafting that bill, in dotting i\u2019s and crossing t\u2019s and making sure that this would pass constitutional muster.\u201d\n\nDeparting Republican Gov.

Meanwhile they're employing \u201cpsychological pricing,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThey give you the impression that you're getting a deal.\u201d It's a dead simple trick, but one we fall prey to. \u201cBecause it has a 9 on the end of it it appears to be on sale,\u201d he said, \u201cso how could you pass it up?\u201d\n\nBut we can't blame it all on the retailer. To understand how some of us are affected by Target's sales-boosting techniques we should look at why others aren't, Chapman said.\n\nThe Target Effect as a Symptom\n\n\u201cPeople who aren't affected, I would consider to be much more emotionally regulated,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're not engaging in retail therapy \u2014 which is just code for shopping as an emotional behavior to provide relief from strong emotions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people just have a hard time dealing with certain emotional experiences, say anxiety,\u201d he went on. So they \u201ctry to do things to feel better. Retail therapy makes them feel better temporarily but the problem is it contributes to more negative consequences.\u201d Despite that, he said, \u201csince we're creatures of habits, 'the next time I'm triggered I do what worked before, but it backfires and I feel like garbage.'\u201d\n\nSo the Target Effect is less its own thing, he said, than a symptom of a different problem.\n\nTools to rein your worst tendencies\n\nStill, though, there are tools shoppers can use to prevent overbuying. \u201cOne strategy is to have a strict budget and to know 'this is what I have every month,'\u201d he said. \u201cThat's not particularly sexy but stating that is important. Frugal and financially consciousness people ... create a budget and don't engage in impulsive buying.'\u201d I learned that myself during a period of unemployment in our household. When there was literally no money available to overspend we just didn't.\n\nBut what if you are less disciplined and/or aren't as financially limited? \u201cThe only way to not succumb [to the Target Effect] is to reprogram your mentality about even going,\u201d Chapman said.\n\n\u201cOne thing I would encourage people to think about is the idea of not \u2014 quote unquote \u2014 window shopping. Window shopping is a misnomer, so why are you wandering around Target if you don't need to be there? This will decrease impulsive buying tendencies. If I don't need to shop and it's not in my budget simply don't go to Target.\u201d Well, there's that. But what about once we're there, and we need a few household things?\n\nGive yourself a pep talk before heading in\n\n\u201cPeople who are emotionally regulated who won't fall victim, they're choosing their thoughts and appraisals beforehand, kind of like pep talking,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nWe can all use these thoughts, he said. \u201cFor instance, say I know I have a problem with Target Effect. Before I go I have to be diligent enough to say I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid today.\n\nI have to strategically pick certain thoughts before I even get in my car that are conducive to only buying what I want to buy.\u201d Key to these thoughts are that they're short and easily memorizable, and realistic, he said.\n\n\u201cOne example of a thought to be would be 'I only need detergent,'\u201d Chapman said. \u201cThe reason that thought is important is the word need based on my budget, the only thing I need to purchase and the only reason I need to go is to purchase this product. [If I] rehearse that, my behavior is guided to the laundry aisle, [I] look at nothing else, and checkout.\u201d\n\nWait, really? Just repeat to yourself you only need detergent? Yes, Chapman said. Say, \u201cI budgeted for dog food so I put on a thought like 'I only need dog food.' That dictates I can only buy dog food so if I buy anything else I'm violating my code.'\u201d\n\nOk, but it's very easy to see this thought turning into 'Yes I only need dog food, BUT...' Right?\n\nBut I see this cute rug on sale, or wouldn't it be nice to have this yummy smelling hand soap?\n\nNeed more backup? Ask yourself these questions\n\nIn this case, Chapman said, \u201cUse disputing questions.\u201d These are \u201call-purpose questions that force you to challenge [those] thoughts. Before I go I need to practice that dialog. I'm only going for dog food but I find this other item conveniently nearby would make me feel better.\n\nWhat's the evidence that I need that [item], that it would make me feel good? You have to base it on evidence that I need that item. Are you 100 percent sure you need to buy it? No, you want it. What's another perspective? 'I would regret it.'\u201d But for this to work, he said, \u201cyou have to practice it before you go.\u201d\n\nIf you think it will take more than repeating some thoughts to combat your Target Effect behavior, there's another level, Chapman said. Drawing up on his experience with people with anxiety, he recommends exposure therapy.\n\n\u201cGo into Target practicing those mantras, and having a companion with [you], going in with the intention of that one item you choose in advance, purchase the item, flee the store, and after the fact, process how you feel emotionally after. If you didn't buy the Poo-Pourri, did the sky fall?\u201d\n\nNow \u201cAsk 'what did I learn?'\u201d he said. \u201cYou learn 'I can go to Target and buy one thing.' That forms a new association in your brain that tell you can buy one thing at Target.\u201d\n\nNow that association can't be rewritten overnight, he said; it can take some practice. But he's so confident, \u201cI would straight up take someone who tells me they are a victim of the Target Effect and take them in and show them,\u201d he said.\n\nLooks like I know who to call next time I just need detergent.\n\nMORE SHOPPING TIPS FROM YOUR FAVORITE STORES\n\nWant more tips like these?

If the signature on the voter registration doesn't match that on the sealed envelope, both Maricopa and Pima County allow voters to help them fix, or \"cure\" it, up to five days after Election Day.\n\nMany other counties only allow voters to cure until polls close on Election Day.\n\nOnly a few thousand votes would be affected by the suit, but every one counts in the razor-close U.S. Senate race between Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Rep. Martha McSally. On Thursday, Sinema jumped into a minuscule lead of about 9,000 out of 1.9 million votes counted after trailing since Tuesday. Her lead came from the two counties singled out by Republicans in their lawsuit, Maricopa and Pima Counties.\n\nThe race remained too close to call with at least 400,000 ballots still uncounted. Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said counting may continue until Nov. 15. \"We know there's urgency out there, but we want to get it right, not quick,\" he said.\n\nArizona is notoriously slow at tallying ballots even though about 75 percent of votes are cast by mail. Each of those ballots must go through a laborious verification process.\n\nIf the signature on the envelope does not match the signature on the voter file, elections officials can contact the voter to try to resolve the discrepancy. Such situations arise, for example, when voters have Parkinson's disease and can no longer sign as they did in the past or as their signature changes over the years.\n\nThe GOP lawsuit centers on that \"cure\" process. It asks that the judge either stop Maricopa and Pima from contacting voters to fix their ballots after Election Day or permit the rest of the state to do it. At least two other rural counties also allow post-Election Day \"cures\" but several others do not.\n\nAttorney Brett Johnson said in an interview the party would be happy if the end result is more votes counted. \"At the end of the day, each vote should be treated the same way,\" Johnson said.\n\nAt a brief hearing Thursday, a Maricopa County official said only about 5,600 ballots are at issue in her county and the rate is similar in the 14 smaller counties. More than 2.2 million votes were cast statewide.\n\nThere were more than 600,000 mail-in ballots left to process statewide as of Wednesday, about 75 percent in Maricopa County. That huge amount has put pressure on a system that spends a lot of time already verifying the mail ballot signatures.\n\nFontes said his office's 1980s-era computer system is partly to blame. It was put in when Maricopa was far smaller and only a handful of its residents voted by mail.\n\nHe said the system only allows his office to tally about 75,000 votes a day. There are another 375,000 votes outstanding in Maricopa County alone as of Thursday night.\n\nThe two Senate campaigns have long braced for a slow vote count. McSally is no stranger to the issue. It took The Associated Press 12 days to declare a winner in McSally's first race for Congress, which she narrowly lost in 2012.\n\nOn Thursday, she tweeted: \"Woke up this morning dreading a long and painful process. I've been here before, and now, here I am again.the dentist's chair.\" She attached a photo of herself leaning back at the dentist's office, about to get her teeth examined.\n\nSinema also had to wait for finality in her first congressional election that year, sweating out six long days of vote counts. She prevailed.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 We guess it\u2019s only fitting \u2014 and expected \u2014 that Election Day 2018 is far from over, with drama and controversies over new vote counts and/or upcoming recounts in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.\n\nBut what is taking place in Florida is now war \u2013 after Republican Rick Scott\u2019s lead in the Senate contest was reduced to just 15,000 votes. Scott, the state\u2019s current governor, filed a lawsuit accusing Democrats of fraud and trying to steal the election. President Trump weighed in, tweeting: \u201cLaw Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!\u201d\n\nWhat happens when you have a 2000-like recount in our current Trump Era \u2013 not only in Florida, but also in Arizona and Georgia? Well, we\u2019re about to find out. The following weeks in Florida could very well define the state over the next two years, and it\u2019s likely to produce a result where half of the state won\u2019t believe it\u2019s legitimate.\n\nHere\u2019s an update of where things stand in Arizona, Florida and Georgia:\n\nArizona Senate\n\nAfter new vote totals came in \u2013 especially from Maricopa County (Phoenix area) and Pima County (Tucson) \u2013 Democrat Kyrsten Sinema has taken a nearly 10,000-vote lead over Republican Martha McSally. But NBC\u2019s Vaughn Hillyard reminds us that this count is FAR FROM OVER, with still nearly 500,000 votes left to count.\n\nHillyard says to expect Sinema\u2019s lead to grow today as similar types of ballots favoring her (early ballots received by the county Friday through Monday) are supposed to be counted. But the McSally camp is anticipating the worm to turn when the results of the \"early ballots hand delivered on Election Day\" are announced, which will likely be on Saturday/Sunday/Monday/Tuesday. Expect that Sinema lead to shrink when those votes are tabulated.\n\nFlorida Senate\n\nRepublican Rick Scott\u2019s lead now stands at just over 15,000 votes, and the margin means that it will go to a recount by hand. But that is far from the only drama. Per NBC\u2019s Ali Vitali, Republican Gov. Rick Scott filed a lawsuit, accusing Democrats of fraud and trying to steal an election.\n\nMore, from Vitali: \u201cThe National Republicans Senatorial Committee joined Scott on Thursday to file suit against both Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes and Palm Beach Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher. Scott alleges that the supervisors have violated federal and state laws by failing to provide information to officials\u2026 Scott also had harsh words for Nelson, who hired a lawyer after election night. Scott accused Nelson of bringing in an attorney to \"try to steal the election and try to thwart the will of the voters of Florida.\"\n\nDemocrats have responded that the recount is simply about determining the accuracy of the vote count. \u201cThe goal here is to see that all the votes in Florida are counted and counted accurately,\u201d Nelson wrote on Twitter. \u201cRick Scott\u2019s action appears to be politically motivated and borne out of desperation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Nelson lawyer Marc Elias says he\u2019s confident that the incumbent Democrat will ultimately be victorious.\n\nGeorgia Governor\n\nWith a 25,632 vote gap to make up to take the race into a runoff, Stacey Abrams isn\u2019t backing down. Her campaign says that Republican Brian Kemp has not been transparent about the outstanding votes, and the state Democratic Party filed suit to seek extensions for some absentee ballots. Kemp, who announced his resignation as secretary of state yesterday, says there aren\u2019t enough outstanding provisional and absentee ballots for Abrams to surmount his lead.\n\nOn Thursday, Gov. Nathan Deal appointed longtime ally Robyn Crittenden \u2014 who is African-American \u2014 to serve out the remainder of Kemp\u2019s term.\n\nThe uncalled Senate races (2):\n\nAZ-SEN\n\nFL-SEN\n\n(MS-SEN goes to runoff)\n\nThe uncalled GOV races (1)\n\nGA-GOV\n\nThe uncalled House races (11)\n\nCA-10\n\nCA-39\n\nCA-45\n\nCA-48\n\nCA-49\n\nGA-7\n\nME-2 (it appears the race is headed to ranked choice to determine the winner)\n\nNM-2 (NBC News retracted its earlier call in favor of the Republicans)\n\nNC-9\n\nNJ-3\n\nUT-4\n\n-- MN-1 (NBC yesterday called GOPer Jim Hagedorn the apparent winner, GOP pickup)\n\nMore controversy surrounds Trump\u2019s new acting attorney general\n\nUnder the old rules, Trump\u2019s pick to be acting attorney general \u2013 Matt Whitaker \u2013 would already be rescinded. But under the new rules? Well, he\u2019s not gone yet, even with more controversy and scrutiny.\n\nThe New York Times: The acting attorney general, Matthew G.

His remarks were reported earlier by The Daily Beast.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018There was interference by the Russians into the election, but that is not collusion with the campaign,\u2019 he added, views that dovetailed with Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding complaints about the investigation. \u2018That\u2019s where the left seems to be just combining those two issues.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump and the GOP is stuck at 45-46 percent\n\nThe day after the election, we noted how Trump\u2019s job rating was higher in places like Florida (51 percent) and Georgia (53 percent) than his national average (45 percent), per the exit polls.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Paul A. Eisenstein\n\nAs the new board chair of Tesla, Robyn Denholm enters rarified territory, one of the few women to reach the upper echelon of what had long been a boys' club, joining General Motors\u2019 Mary Barra, the only other female chairman in the auto industry.\n\nWhile the electric car maker remains short on cash but long on ambition, the 55-year-old Australian will face some tough and immediate challenges at a company that only recently delivered a rare profit. But perhaps the biggest test for Denholm will be finding a way to rein in the increasingly erratic behavior of Elon Musk, the 47-year-old chief executive officer whose August tweets about taking Tesla private led the Securities and Exchange Commission to force him to relinquish the chairman\u2019s post.\n\n\"I believe in this company, I believe in its mission and I look forward to helping Elon and the Tesla team achieve sustainable profitability and drive long-term shareholder value,\" Denholm said in a statement issued after her appointment was announced on Thursday.\n\nThough Denholm has been an independent Tesla director since 2014, her appointment came as a surprise to outside observers who had been expecting a more high-profile choice. Barely a month ago, speculation centered around 21st Century Fox\u2019s CEO James Murdoch. The media executive had his shortfalls, however, including his ties to the controversial Fox News channel, as well as a lack of experience in the auto industry.\n\nDenholm, who will be coming on full time with Tesla within the next six months, has been serving as the chief financial officer for the Australian telecommunications company Telstra, but she has also worked at Toyota, serving as finance manager for the carmaker\u2019s operations in her home country.\n\nHer experience in financial management should prove critical for Tesla. The company\u2019s high-flying stock price can\u2019t conceal the weakness of its balance sheet. The electric car manufacturer delivered a surprise, $311.5 million profit \u2014 rather than the more than $200 million loss industry analysts had forecast for the third quarter. It was only the third time Tesla was in the black since going public in 2010 and it appears to bode well for Musk, who had promised his company would be profitable and deliver positive cash flow for the second half of 2018.\n\nStill, there are a number of observers who question whether Tesla can, as Musk insists, fund its aggressive growth strategy without going back to the well for another capital infusion over the next year or so. Not only does the company have to spend millions to boost capacity at its Fremont, California, assembly plant but it also has to pay for the construction of a second plant going up in Shanghai. And then there are all the new products that Musk, who will continue as CEO, has promised:\n\nA second-generation Roadster\n\nA compact SUV to complement the new Model 3 battery-sedan\n\nAn all-electric full-size pickup truck\n\nA battery-electric semi-truck.\n\nIn her post as a board member, Denholm appeared to support Musk\u2019s ambitious master plan, but she will now have greater responsibility in ensuring it can all be funded.\n\nYet, that might not be her biggest challenge. Since last spring, the South African-born Musk\u2019s behavior has become increasingly controversial. He first came under fire when he derided several industry analysts during a first-quarter earnings call. He subsequently got into a flame war with a British diver who helped rescue a group of Thai teens trapped in a flooded cave and now faces a defamation lawsuit. Musk tossed fuel on the fire when he lit up a joint while appearing on comedian Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast.\n\nBut the biggest problem followed his August tweet in which he announced a plan to take Tesla private, declaring \u201cFunding secured.\u201d It turned out Musk had only had the most preliminary discussions with officials from a Saudi Arabian sovereign investment fund. The plan quickly collapsed and the SEC sued Musk, something that could have seen him banned from holding a management position in a public company for life. The settlement required Musk to step down as chairman and pay a $20 million fine \u2014 which critics said was barely more than a speeding ticket for someone of his wealth.\n\nFinding a way to encourage Musk\u2019s creativity, even while smoothing out his quirky behavior has been something that Tesla\u2019s friends and foes alike have been hoping to find in a new chairman.\n\n\"Can (Denholm) check Elon? I'm not sure, and I'm not sure if anyone could check him. Maybe his brother,\u201d Kimbal Musk, Baird analyst Ben Kallo said in an interview with CNBC. \u201cBut I think if they had his brother as chairperson everyone would be up in arms.\"\n\nIf anything, initial reaction to Denholm is that they found a perfectly boring sort of finance wonk who can offset the mercurial Musk.\n\nFor his part, the CEO seemed pleased with his new chair. \"Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together,\" Musk said in a tweet.\n\nHow the pair wind up working together in their new roles should become obvious quickly considering the CEO\u2019s addiction to Twitter.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

She expresses disbelief over how so many women would choose a \"misogynist\" over Hillary Clinton, \"an exceptionally qualified female candidate.\" She remembers how her body \"buzzed with fury\" after seeing the infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Trump brags about sexually assaulting women.\n\nThe former first lady, however, also gets personal in the book, disclosing previously-unrevealed details about her struggles in trying to conceive.\n\nIn an interview that aired Friday morning with ABC News, Obama explained how she experienced a miscarriage 20 years ago \u2014 saying she felt \"lost and alone\" afterward \u2014 and ultimately used in-vitro fertilization to conceive her two daughters.\n\n\u201cI felt like I failed because I didn't know how common miscarriages were because we don't talk about them,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe sit in our own pain, thinking that somehow we\u2019re broken.\u201d\n\n\"We had to do IVF,\" she said.\n\nShe also revealed that she and Barack attended marriage counseling as a young couple.\n\n\u201cI know too many young couples who struggle and think that somehow there's something wrong with them,\" she said. \"And I want them to know that Michelle and Barack Obama, who have a phenomenal marriage and who love each other, we work on our marriage.

Obama is admired worldwide and has offered few extensive comments on her White House years.\n\nIn \"Becoming,\" Obama shares both pain and joy. She writes lovingly of her family and gives a detailed account of her courtship with her future husband, whom she met when both were at the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin LLP; she was initially his adviser. Secretaries claimed he was both brilliant and \"cute,\" although Michelle Obama was skeptical, writing that white people went \"bonkers\" any time you \"put a suit\" on a \"half-intelligent black man.\" She also thought his picture had a \"whiff of geekiness.\"\n\nBut she was more than impressed after meeting him, by his \"rich, even sexy baritone\" and by his \"strange, stirring combination\" of serenity and power. \"This strange mix-of-everything-man,\" when she finally let him kiss her, set off a \"toppling blast of lust, gratitude, fulfillment, wonder.\"\n\nBut throughout her husband's life in politics, she fought to balance public and private needs, and to maintain her self-esteem. She agonized over what she feared was a cartoonish, racist image. She remembered being labeled \"angry\" and, by the Fox network, \"Obama's Baby Mama.\" At times, she feared she was damaging her husband's 2008 presidential campaign, especially after conservatives seized on a line from one of her speeches \u2014 taken out of context, she notes \u2014 that for the first time as an adult she was \"really proud\" of her country.\n\nAs the first black first lady, she knew she would be labeled \"other\" and would have to earn the aura of \"grace\" given freely to her white predecessors. She found confidence in repeating to herself a favorite chant: \"Am I good enough? Yes I am.\"\n\n\"Becoming\" is part of a joint book deal with former President Barack Obama, whose memoir is expected next year, that is believed worth tens of millions of dollars.

Anti-Marcos activists and human rights victims welcomed the conviction as long overdue.\n\nThe court disqualified Marcos from holding public office, but she can remain a member of the powerful House of Representatives while appealing the decision. Her congressional term will end next year but she has registered to run to replace her daughter as governor of northern Ilocos Norte province.\n\n\"I was jumping up and down in joy in disbelief,\" said former Commission on Human Rights chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales, who was among many activists locked up after Imelda's husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos, declared martial law in the Philippines in 1972.\n\nRosales said the decision was a huge setback to efforts by the Marcos family to revise history by denying many of the atrocities under the dictatorship, and urged Filipinos to fight all threats against democracy and civil liberties.\n\nFormer Sen. Aquilino Pimentel Jr., who was also jailed during the Marcos dictatorship, said it was up to voters in next year's May 13 local elections, where Marcos is a candidate, if they want \"somebody who has a bad name representing them, that's your call.\"\n\nImelda Marcos' husband was ousted by an army-backed \"people power\" revolt in 1986. He died in self-exile in Hawaii in 1989 but his widow and children returned to the Philippines. Most have been elected to public offices in an impressive political comeback.\n\nGovernment prosecutor Ryan Quilala told reporters that Marcos and her husband opened and managed Swiss foundations in violation of the Philippine Constitution, using aliases in a bid to hide stolen funds. The Marcoses have been accused of plundering the government's coffers amid crushing poverty. They have denied any wrongdoing and have successfully fought many other corruption cases.\n\nImelda Marcos was acquitted Friday in three other cases, which were filed in 1991 and took nearly three decades of trial by several judges and prosecutors. She was once convicted of a graft case in 1993, but the Supreme Court later cleared her of any wrongdoing.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte, an ally of the Marcoses, said last year the Marcos family had indicated a willingness to return a still-unspecified amount of money and \"a few gold bars\" to help ease budget deficits. He indicated the family still denied that the assets had been stolen as alleged by political opponents.\n\nFerdinand Marcos had placed the Philippines under martial rule a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress, ordered the arrest of political rivals and left-wing activists and ruled by decree. His family is said to have amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power.\n\nA Hawaii court found Marcos liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances.\n\nDuterte has acknowledged that Imee Marcos, the couple's daughter and a provincial governor, backed his presidential candidacy.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Carol E. Lee\n\nPARIS \u2014 President Donald Trump is headed to France, bruised yet emboldened by an election at home and set to face many world leaders pushing a global view squarely at odds with his \"America First\" vision.\n\nLooming over Trump\u2019s weekend in Paris, where dozens of heads of state will commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I and call for more international engagement, is the prospect of an impromptu pull-aside discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nA formal meeting between Trump and Putin was pushed back until later this month when they\u2019re both in Argentina for a global summit. But it\u2019s possible a substantive discussion could take place here as the two men have held lengthy informal exchanges on the sidelines of other international gatherings.\n\nThe potential encounter between Trump and Putin comes as special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election is expected to publicly ramp up after a quiet couple of months during the midterm campaigns. And Trump is expecting an onslaught of congressional oversight investigations from Democrats after he\u2019s back home.\n\nOn Thursday the Trump administration took steps likely to anger Russia and please European leaders by adopting new sanctions in response Moscow\u2019s continued \"destabilizing\" activity in Crimea.\n\nTrump\u2019s Paris visit is a consolation trip of sorts. He initially directed the Pentagon to organize a U.S. military parade in Washington to mark Veterans Day, but those plans were scuttled when the price tag came in at more than $90 million.\n\nInstead Trump said he would accept French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s invitation to attend this weekend\u2019s events in Paris. And while the president had called the celebration of Armistice Day a \"parade,\" it\u2019s actually a series of events, including a dinner Saturday night and a ceremony on Sunday at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nAs he left the White House for the trip Friday morning, Trump told reporters he is looking forward to the weekend\u2019s events. \u201cThe leadership of many countries will be there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a great commemorative service. I think it's going to be something very special.\u201d\n\nThe pageantry will include a speech by Macron next to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and a performance by cellist Yo-Yo Ma.\n\nTrump, who will be joined by first lady Melania Trump, will also visit Aisne-Marne American Cemetery in Northern France. His only expected formal remarks are Sunday at Suresnes American Cemetery. Trump is only the third sitting U.S. president to visit the cemetery, which is a World War I and World War II memorial.\n\n\"This is a historic opportunity to honor the sacrifices of those who gave their lives for our freedom in that struggle,\" said a senior administration official briefing reporters on the trip. \"The president's participation in these events will also serve as the reminder of the important role that the United States has played and continues to play in ensuring peace and security in Europe.\"\n\nThe official specifically mentioned the weekend\u2019s events being an opportunity for Trump to highlight the importance of deterring the use of chemical weapons in conflicts today.\n\nTrump\u2019s only scheduled meeting with a world leader is on Saturday with Macron.\n\nHis other counterparts in Paris, however, will be paying close attention during his first appearance outside of the U.S. since Democrats won control of the House and his own Republican Party held the Senate.\n\nFor them, Tuesday\u2019s election was the first indicator of whether Trump is likely to be a one-term president or will have the staying power that could generate a long-term shift in American foreign policy. While some European leaders, such as the new prime minister of Italy, Giuseppe Conte, have embraced Trump, others have been roiled by his criticism of trade pacts and longtime U.S. alliances on the continent.\n\nErik Brattberg, director of the Europe program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said European leaders who read the elections as \u201ca mixed picture\u201d are intensifying their debate over whether Europe should reconsider its relationship with the U.S. on foreign policy and defense issues.\n\n\"It is clear that he will now have a little bit more of a check in terms of the Democrats controlling the House,\" Brattberg said of Trump. \"At the same time, it\u2019s not the sort of widespread repudiation that some European leaders were hoping for. European leaders are realizing that he\u2019s still a very formidable player in U.S. politics and that it\u2019s very possible he\u2019ll be around for another six years.\"\n\nThe tradition of a presidential trip abroad in the days after a midterm election can be the welcome reprieve from political headwinds at home and a chance to advance foreign policy initiatives. But for Trump, who has claimed Tuesday\u2019s midterm results as a victory, it\u2019s unlikely to be either. Substantive discussions about trade, climate change or strained U.S.-Russia relations are not expected to take place. And Trump\u2019s world view is unlikely to get a warm embrace.\n\nHeather Conley, director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the backdrop Macron tried to create for the commemoration in Paris this weekend is \"that this need for greater international engagement to solve international problems is key.\"\n\n\"The question is whether the president will use this moment to emphasize his points \u2014 that he believes nationalism is at the heart of solving problems for the United States,\" she said, or if other leaders\u2019 points of view will prevail.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Heidi Przybyla\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Fresh off a midterm election that has given them control over levers of congressional oversight, Democrats have made clear they plan to step up their efforts to monitor special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nBut that\u2019s just one of a myriad of issues they are planning to aggressively pursue.\n\nFor two years, House Democrats trying to police the Trump administration have pressed the White House, cabinet officials and others for answers on issues ranging from the treatment of undocumented immigrants to potential Trump family conflicts of interest. Little of that outreach, coming in the form of official letters from the minority party, ever got a response.\n\nAs they prepare to ascend to the House majority, Democrats are using a trove of more than 100 letters \u2014 rejected or ignored by Republican committee leaders and federal agencies \u2014 as a template to map their approach to oversight in the new Congress.\n\nThose letters, assembled as a 67-page document by House Judiciary Committee Democrats, were shared with NBC News.\n\nAside from the investigation into Russian attempts to meddle in the 2016 election, top Democratic leaders insist they also want to prioritize oversight around things that matter most to the American people, including health care.\n\nYet the Democrats who will actually chair the chamber\u2019s most powerful committees say they will use their new powers to pursue many questions and requests that have gone unanswered until now. \"The American people voted to give the House of Representatives a mandate\" to conduct \"credible\" investigations, Maryland Democrat Elijah Cummings, the incoming House Oversight Committee chair, said after Democrats flipped the House on Tuesday.\n\nCummings\u2019s office said that until now, the committee under GOP control has stalled most investigations. The current chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., has issued just one subpoena \u2014 to a Department of Homeland Security career employee \u2014 and blocked 64 motions by Democrats, even as the administration hasn\u2019t answered dozens of document requests. Gowdy issued 14 subpoenas during the Benghazi Committee investigating former 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Gowdy's office did not respond to requests to comment.\n\nThe 64 denied motions relate to issues ranging from news reports that members of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort may have influenced policy decisions to the Agriculture Department\u2019s communications with corporate lobbyists and foreign payments to the Trump Organization.\n\nGuide to the probes\n\nThe letters provide a sampling of Democrats' priorities. Many reflect the interests of the incoming House Judiciary Committee Chairman, New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler, while several dovetail with areas that Cummngs has pursued.\n\nIssues reflected in the letters include the rise of white supremacist violence; the administration\u2019s treatment of undocumented immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border; and Trump family conflicts of interest, including potential violations of the Emoluments Clause to the U.S. Constitution that prohibit a president from profiting from the office.\n\nWhite Supremacy: Early in the Trump administration, officials froze $10 million in funding granted to several groups dedicated to combating white supremacist and neo-Nazi movements. A Feb. 22, 2017 letter signed by over 150 Democrats and Republicans urged the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to address \u201cthreats to Jewish organizations\u201d after bomb threats had been telephoned in to Jewish community centers across the nation. Days before the 2018 midterms, a gunman opened fire at a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 and wounding six, in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.\n\nImmigration: In April, a bipartisan group of 32 House members sent a letter to then DHS-secretary John Kelly requesting information on how immigrant victims of crimes such as human trafficking would be protected in light of Trump\u2019s executive orders pertaining to interior and border enforcement. On Oct. 26, another letter from Democrats on the subcommittee on immigration to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine C. Duke expressed concern regarding the detention of a 10-year old with cerebral palsy immediately after being released from surgery.\n\nOther letters pertained to the termination of programs providing \"critical legal assistance\" to detained immigrants. One year after the initial letter, and following Trump\u2019s creation of numerous detention centers at the border, the DHS responded in a four-page letter, the report notes, while listing a host of additional pending inquiries about detention centers that have become controversial.\n\nHealthcare: In a letter dated June 2018, Democrats raised \"serious concerns\" about the administration\u2019s decision not to defend key protections of the Affordable Care Act from a legal challenge filed in Texas by a coalition of Republican-led states. The letter insisted that the administration is obligated to \"defend\" the nation\u2019s health care law from the attempt to invalidate it. The Trump administration has decided not to defend several important provisions including those that would gut protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n\nConflicts of Interest: Several letters hint at the kind of conflicts-of-interest inquiries Democrats will initiate against the Trump family.\n\nOn May 3, 2017 in a letter to the Ivanka Trump Collection, Judiciary Democrats asked that Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and a White House senior adviser, recuse herself from any \"particular matters affecting her financial interests\" given her role as an adviser to the president. Before and after Ms. Trump accepted her position, she participated in meeting with officials from countries like Japan and China in which she \"has significant financial interests \u2014 including pending licensing deals and trademark applications,\" the letter states. Also that month, they inquired about Trump\u2019s financial ties to China following his advocacy for Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE.\n\nA day before Tuesday\u2019s midterm election, the left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported Ivanka Trump\u2019s fashion brand received first approval for 16 new trademarks from the Chinese government in October.\n\nHow the Democrats proceed with trying to obtain Trump\u2019s federal tax returns remains the big unknown.\n\nTrump is likely to fight any request by the House Ways and Means Committee to the Internal Revenue Service for his tax returns, which could force a prolonged legal standoff.\n\n\"The American people will see his tax returns, not because of voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he is corrupt. We will look at the cashing-in of access to the Oval Office,\" said Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nMatt Miller, who served at the Justice Department under Obama during the Republicans\u2019 2010 House takeover, said the Democrats\u2019 requests are likely to create a significant strain for federal agencies that have been subject to scant oversight by the GOP-led Congress.\n\n\"It is a significant drain on the time of senior officials and there\u2019s an opportunity cost because you can\u2019t focus on your agenda,\" said Miller.\n\nAnd, he added, \"if you have any real liability there\u2019s this drip, drip, drip before hand that is paralyzing and can be fatal.\"", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Corey Brettschneider, professor of political science at Brown University\n\nMere hours after Democrats retook the House, President Donald Trump announced the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the appointment of Matthew Whitaker as the acting attorney general. Whitaker, formerly the Department of Justice\u2019s chief of staff, has expressed skepticism about special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, leading to renewed concerns that Mueller's job is in jeopardy.\n\nGiven the available information, these concerns seem justified. But there is a solution: The Senate urgently needs to pass a bipartisan bill that cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in April. The bill, The Special Counsel and Integrity Act, would protect Mueller and his vital investigation from executive meddling.\n\nRepublican opponents of the bill suggest it might be unconstitutional. That is mistaken. The bill is part of an important constitutional and legislative tradition that works to constrain the power of presidents and prevents them from firing executive employees at will.\n\nThe bill is part of an important constitutional and legislative tradition that works to constrain the power of presidents and prevents them from firing executive employees at will.\n\nDespite the statements of Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Mueller does need congressional protection due to a flaw in our constitutional system. This flaw could permit the new attorney general to fire a special counsel for political reasons, including to shield the president from investigation.\n\nThat same defect has caused problems in the past, sparking a constitutional crisis during Watergate when President Richard Nixon sought to have special prosecutor Archibald Cox fired. Cox was investigating Nixon\u2019s involvement in the Watergate break-in and the subsequent cover-up. Nixon first asked Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Cox. When Richardson resigned rather than carry out the order, Nixon asked Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus, who also resigned. Finally, Nixon appointed Robert Bork, who complied in firing Cox.\n\nThere are now internal justice department regulations that protect Mueller from Cox\u2019s fate. But they could be revoked, and they are even weaker than at Cox\u2019s time. We cannot count on the courts to save Mueller under the current system.\n\nAfter Nixon\u2019s resignation, Congress realized that it could not trust presidents to protect those charged with investigating them\u2014or to honor Justice Department rules if those rules risked getting them into hot water. So, Congress passed a law creating an \u201cindependent counsel\u201d that insulated criminal investigations of a president from political considerations and illegitimate executive branch interference. The statute made clear that courts can stop a president from firing an independent counsel without good cause.\n\nHowever, that important legislation expired after Bill Clinton argued it had enabled Kenneth Starr to launch what many believed was an overly broad investigation that veered into Clinton\u2019s sex life. Even while it was in force, the law had an opponent in Justice Antonin Scalia, whose 1988 dissent in Morrison v. Olson argued that the law wrongly restricted a president\u2019s power. In Scalia\u2019s view, prosecutors were carrying out purely executive functions. He argued it would violate the president\u2019s power as head of the executive branch to restrict his hiring and firing ability over the independent counsel.\n\nThe Republican opposition to the current bill to protect Mueller relies on a similar argument. Sen. Orrin Hatch, for example, has argued that the proposed bill is unconstitutional because prosecution is a \u201ccore executive function,\u201d directly echoing Scalia.\n\nBut Hatch and other Senate Republicans who claim the bill is potentially unconstitutional should not use Scalia as their guide. In Morrison, Scalia was a sole dissenter. The rest of the Supreme Court voted to uphold the independent prosecutor law. This added to a long tradition of recognizing the constitutionality of laws that sought to protect core government functions from presidential abuse.\n\nThe most famous law in this tradition was passed after a presidential assassination. In 1881, a disgruntled campaign worker, Charles Guiteau, shot and killed President James A. Garfield. Guiteau felt that his work on the campaign entitled him to a patronage job in the federal government. Such a stark example of the politicization of the federal bureaucracy led to the passage in 1883 of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. The law insulated civil servants from political firings and made courts responsible for protecting them. This assertion of political independence for government workers made it possible for them to carry out their legislatively-assigned tasks without fear of reprisal by a president. The law emphasized that the role of executive officials was to carry out the law, not manipulate it to advance their own agendas.\n\nA 1935 court case, Humphrey\u2019s Executor, upheld Congress\u2019s right to protect even high-level officials from firing. President Franklin Roosevelt sought to fire a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission because he didn\u2019t share Roosevelt\u2019s progressive politics. But the Supreme Court ruled that the president\u2019s power of removal was not \u201cilliminable\u201d or without restriction. The president\u2019s power to fire even high ranking officials is limited when those officials occupy a quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial role.\n\nToday\u2019s bill to protect Mueller fits squarely in the tradition of both the post-Nixon independent counsel law and the long history of laws and cases protecting executive officials from political retaliation by the president.\n\nToday\u2019s bill to protect Mueller fits squarely in the tradition of both the post-Nixon independent counsel law and the long history of laws and cases protecting executive officials from political retaliation by the president. The abiding principle has been that civil servants must be protected, unless they fail in their job duties, especially when they are in roles that might challenge a president\u2019s personal interests.\n\nThat is clearly relevant to Mueller. His investigation is probing Trump\u2019s and his campaign\u2019s possible links with the Russian government \u2014 and possible obstruction of justice. Mueller\u2019s job is to make sure that the highest government official in the land does not flout the basic restraints that all government officials and citizens must abide by. He can\u2019t do that job effectively if he can be removed at will by the president.\n\nFears about the bill restricting the president\u2019s rightful power and giving too much leeway to prosecutors are overblown. The Mueller bill is less expansive than the independent counsel law passed after Watergate, and even conservative legal scholars sympathetic to Scalia believe it to be constitutional. It calls for the special counsel to remain within the Justice Department, still supervised by the attorney general. Robust protections for prosecutors could make them overly eager, but that risk pales in comparison to the specter of a president who can manipulate the justice system to hide his own wrongdoing. As James Madison said, \u201cNo man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause.\u201d\n\nThough a more long-term fix that insulates presidential investigators outside the Justice Department would be optimal in terms of protecting prosecutorial independence, the current bill will suffice in what is quickly becoming an emergency situation.\n\nEven in a democracy, no official can simply be trusted to do the right thing. Our country needs checks that ensure public officials work in the public interest. The law must be strong enough so that someone like Trump cannot bully his way out of accountability.\n\nPassing this bill to safeguard Mueller\u2019s investigation is constitutionally sound and necessary for maintaining the integrity of our democracy. Arguments from an unauthoritative Scalia dissent must not stop the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional obligation to check the self-interested motives of the president.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Benjy Sarlin\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats made gains and held critical seats in the Midwestern and Rust Belt states that Donald Trump flipped in 2016, raising hopes that the party can still compete in 2020 and beyond.\n\nDemocratic senators in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin won, all states that were pivotal to Trump's Electoral College victory. Both of Minnesota's senators also easily prevailed, despite Trump's close 2016 margin in the state.\n\nBut Republicans won two key governor's races, in Iowa and Ohio, and there were signs below the surface that some changes Trump had wrought are here to stay.\n\nPollsters, political strategists and academics say there wasn't one neat story coming out of the region after the midterms, with wide variation in Democrats' performance from state to state and race to race.\n\nIn many cases, trends from the last election seemed to pick up speed in 2018, with Democrats gaining even more in well-off suburbs and Republicans still surging in rural and working-class areas. The results suggest that whatever the future holds for Democrats, a winning map in each state might not look the same as it did under President Barack Obama.\n\nMinnesota, where Democrat Tim Walz won the governor's seat and his party captured the state Legislature's lower chamber, may have best exemplified the Trump-era realignment in the region.\n\nDemocrats won two Republican-held House seats in the affluent Minnesota suburbs and took control of the Legislature. But despite a strong night overall, they also appear to have lost two House seats in the rural Iron Range and southern counties, both of which have trended sharply Republican under Trump.\n\nBut there were also encouraging signs for Democrats in Minnesota, as well as other Obama-Trump states, that the right candidate could bridge the gap between Trump-trending and Democrat-trending voters.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar won a commanding 60 percent of the vote on Tuesday, including strong performances in the Iron Range. She easily outpaced fellow Democratic Sen. Tina Smith, who picked up a more modest 53 percent of the vote en route to an easy victory.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where Democrats had one of their best performances, Gov. Tom Wolf and Sen. Bob Casey romped to huge wins against GOP opponents who mirrored Trump's style but never made either race competitive.\n\nTheir victories were powered by even higher margins than Clinton in Democratic-trending suburbs, but candidates also showed strength in some areas that Trump flipped. Casey won working-class Erie County in the northwest by 18 points, which Trump had narrowly carried, and held down GOP margins in coal country. That suggests some ancestral Democrats who defected to Trump may not be lost.\n\nBut these trends didn't translate to gains across the board either: Republicans held onto several tough House seats even with a new court-ordered map that was more favorable to Democrats.\n\nRepublican strategist John Brabender, who worked on several 2018 campaigns, including Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta's losing race against Casey, said the results raised troubling questions for Republicans moving forward, including whether crossover voters in 2016 might have been protesting Hillary Clinton rather than supporting Trump.\n\n\"I know a lot of people will say it's bad news for the president,\" he said. \"We don't know that, but we know a pro-Democrat voter in the Rust Belt states who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 isn't an automatic Republican vote when Donald Trump isn't on the ballot.\"\n\nMichigan was another bright spot for Democrats, led by Gretchen Whitmer's decisive win in the governor's race. Sen. Debbie Stabenow defeated Republican challenger John James by six points, though it was a relatively modest margin given that she was favored throughout. Democrats also picked up a House seat in the Detroit suburbs, with Elissa Slotkin defeating Rep. Mike Bishop.\n\nBut in Ohio, the picture looked darker for Democrats. Republican Mike DeWine defeated Democrat Rich Cordray in the hotly contested governor's race thanks to strong turnout in rural and working class areas Trump excited in 2016, managing to overcome similar bumps in turnout in Democratic-trending areas. Republicans maintained their hold on key positions like attorney general, secretary of state, treasurer, and auditor.\n\nAt the same time, Sen. Sherrod Brown held his seat with a 6.5 point margin, again suggesting there's room for a Democrat to win with the right brand. In his victory speech, Brown called his campaign \"the blueprint for our nation in 2020.\"\n\nThe results could bolster the case for potential presidential contenders who have an established appeal with rural and blue-collar voters, like Brown, Klobuchar or former Vice President Joe Biden, over more progressive rivals.\n\n\"Good news for the Dems: These voters are reachable with the right kind of candidate,\" said Jeff Blehar, an elections analyst for Decision Desk HQ. \"Bad news for the Dems: It's not the kind of candidate you're likely to nominate for 2020.\"\n\nSimilarly in Iowa, results were mixed. Democrats made gains on a congressional level, winning two seats and even threatening ultra-conservative Rep. Steve King, who was effectively disavowed by the national Republican Party over his ties to far-right and anti-Semitic figures.\n\nDemocrat Abby Finkenauer's victory over Rep. Rod Blum in Iowa's 1st District, a longtime bastion for union Democrats that swung toward Republicans in recent years, offered the party hope that the spell Trump cast wasn't permanent.\n\nAt the state level, though, things looked very different. Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds won in a mild upset over Democrat Fred Hubbell. Democrats picked up a few statehouse seats, but lost state Senate seats at the same time, leaving Republicans with unified control of government.\n\nJeff Link, a Democratic strategist who advised Hubbell, described an election night similar to other states in the Trump era. First, elation at better-than-expected margins in cities and suburbs, followed by groans as even more decisive rural margins came in.\n\n\"I think we've figured out messaging for college-educated people in cities, but we can't do that at the expense of rural communities,\" he said. \"If we ignore them, it becomes very difficult to win the United States Senate and it becomes very difficult, I think, to win the presidency.\"\n\nIn Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers narrowly toppled two-term Gov. Scott Walker while Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a prime target early in the cycle, easily dispatched challenger Leah Vukmir by a double-digit margin.\n\nBoth made gains in wealthy suburbs, including crucial Waukesha County, that typically vote Republican, even as Walker improved in some rural areas. In an extremely encouraging sign for Democrats looking to 2020, their base in the Milwaukee area showed up in huge numbers after a fatal collapse in turnout in 2016.\n\nCharles Franklin, a pollster and professor at Marquette University Law School, noted that Democrats flipped southwestern counties that Trump won en route to his 2016 win, and Baldwin showcased her strength in the Green Bay area, which normally votes Republican. Overall, Baldwin won 17 counties that went for Trump in 2016.\n\nFranklin identified the party's relentless emphasis on health care as a potential factor in their turnaround.\n\n\"In our poll, those ranking it most important went 65 percent Evers and 70 percent Baldwin,\u201d he said.\n\nWith health care a top issue in almost every major race, the results could offer a valuable blueprint for how to compete against Trump in 2020 versus 2016, when Democrats focused more on his offensive behavior.\n\nDemocrats were not successful in Wisconsin at the state legislative level, though, where gerrymandered district lines helped boost Republicans.\n\nAmanda Litman, whose group Run For Something recruited young Democratic candidates in statehouse races around the country, said Democrats needed to continue running plausible contenders in working-class areas year after year to build a foothold.\n\n\"Winning back Obama/Trump voters won't happen in a single cycle,\" Litman said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Blockchain is best known as the basis for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin but in recent years has attracted interest from a variety of industries that see a benefit in using the ideas behind blockchain.\n\nA good rule: Anyone who suggests \"blockchain\" and \"online voting\" neither understands computer security nor voting. \u2014 Nicholas Weaver (@ncweaver) November 5, 2018\n\nOne of those areas is voting. In May, West Virginia introduced a new way for state residents living abroad to submit their ballots using Voatz, a mobile election platform that utilizes blockchain among other technologies. The state has used the technology in their primary elections, and almost 140 West Virginians voted in the midterms with the Voatz app.\n\nExcitement for the possibility of creating easy and secure voting systems with blockchain technology was also bolstered by The New York Times, which published an opinion piece on Monday by Alex Tapscott, the co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute. He suggested blockchain technology could be used to solve the issues plaguing the \u201cdated\u201d voting process in the United States, transitioning voting from in-person to digital.\n\nThe op-ed was not well received by blockchain and voting experts.\n\n\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d Angela Walch, an associate professor at St. Mary\u2019s University School of Law and blockchain researcher, tweeted. \u201cPlease stop pumping #blockchain tech for critically important use cases like voting in public elections when all actual voting experts disagree.

A wide variety of companies have invested in developing new systems based on blockchain technology, including Facebook and IBM.\n\nBut that hype has led to growing skepticism that blockchain can be a cure-all for any system that needs modernization without adequate understanding of what blockchain technology does.\n\nMatt Blaze, an associate professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, tweeted that blockchain advocates would need to answer a lot of questions before the technology would be ready to use in national elections.\n\n\u201cThe charlatans pushing for blockchain elections and online voting are doing the equivalent of advocating a health care policy that assumes we\u2019re about to cure cancer,\u201d Blaze tweeted. \u201cMaybe we will, but best not to bet on it.\u201d\n\nWhile the votes cast in West Virginia did represent a major step for blockchain, the Committee on the Future of Voting, part of the prestigious National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, an independent advisory group, said in a recent report that blockchain technology, while intriguing, cannot be seriously considered yet.", "Fla.

The children by and large are using the cartridge based systems.\"\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the FDA's plans Thursday.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday that adult smoking rates have dropped to their lowest level yet, at 14 percent. But the CDC found that 47.4 million U.S. adults , or 19 percent of the adult population, uses any tobacco product, including cigarettes, cigars, or e-cigarettes.\n\nPublic health experts have been complaining that the fruity, candy-like flavors found in e-cigarettes are targeted directly at children and teenagers, and rates of teen cigarette use have soared.\n\nThe FDA has also expressed concern about online sales to teens. In September, the FDA made an unannounced visit to Juul headquarters to look for evidence about the company's marketing practices. In April, the agency launched what it called a \"blitz\" to stop retailers from selling vaping products to underage children. And it has warned several online sites about sales.\n\nNext week, the FDA will do more, the official said.\n\n\"We're also going to restrict online sales only to sites that put in place specific age verification measures and limit access to kids that we are going to specify in guidance,\" the official said.\n\n\"This is just the first step. We will consider other steps if use doesn't come down, and sharply.\"\n\nThe FDA action will not affect menthol or mint flavored products. That's because, the official said, it hasn't yet been able to limit the use of menthol in traditional, combustible cigarettes.\n\n\"We don't want to create a situation where the combustible products have features that make them more attractive than e-cigarettes,\" the official said.\n\n\"For the foreseeable future, we are going to allow menthol to remain in e-cigarettes.\"\n\nPublic health groups including the American Heart Association, American Lung Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Truth Initiative and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, have been urging the FDA to move faster and to remove Juul from the market until it undergoes an FDA review.\n\nThe FDA and CDC both say it's not clear whether e-cigarettes are safer than smoking burnt tobacco, but agree the nicotine in both is highly addictive and that teenagers should not use either.\n\nConsumer and health groups said the FDA should do more.\n\n\"To reverse the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use, the FDA needs to stop the sales of all flavored e-cigarette products that have not been subject to public health review by the FDA as the law requires,\" the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, American Heart Association, American Lung Association and Truth Initiative said in a joint statement.\n\n\"There is nothing to prevent the number of vape shops from rapidly expanding and there is no solid evidence that vape shops do a good job of preventing illegal underage sales. In addition, youth use of e-cigarettes is not limited to Juul and other pod-type products. Even before the introduction of Juul, e-cigarettes had become the most commonly used tobacco product among kids and research found that 81 percent of youth who ever tried e-cigarettes started with a flavored product.\"", "Watch protesters across the country call for the protection of Mueller copied!\n\nProtesters gathered in cities across the country to call for the protection of Special Counsel Robert Mueller after the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nRead More"]
