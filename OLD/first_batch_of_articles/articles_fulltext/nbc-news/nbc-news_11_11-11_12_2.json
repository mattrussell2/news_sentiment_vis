Timm\n\nAs several key contests across the U.S. remain close, President Donald Trump has zeroed in on Florida, making a slew of unsubstantiated claims about \"forged\" ballots and \"found\" votes.\n\n\"When will Bill Nelson concede in Florida? The characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nThere is no evidence of widespread fraud or forged ballots in the state, election observers and law enforcement said.\n\nOn Monday, Republican Gov. Rick Scott's Senate campaign sought a mandatory injunction to impound voting machines that were not being currently reviewed in Broward County, but a judge shot him down, noting that there was no evidence of voter fraud of irregularities.\n\n\"I don't think I have any evidence to enter a mandatory injunction right now,\" Judge Jack Tuter said.\n\n\"If someone in this lawsuit, or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisors office, they should report it to their local law enforcement officer,\" he added. \"If the lawyers are aware of it, they should get the person to swear out an affidavit, but everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country. We need to be careful what we say.\"\n\nLet's take a look at Trump\u2019' more specific claims and the facts.\n\nClaim: Ballots \"out of nowhere,\" missing and forged\n\n\"The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged,\" Trump wrote in a tweet.\n\nA large number of ballots did not show up out of nowhere; they came in the mail.\n\nSome 2.5 million Floridians voted requested mail-in ballots this election, and many of them were delivered back to election administrators on Election Day. Those are typically counted after polls close on Election Day, and counting a single ballot can take days if there are any problems.\n\nCounting mail-in ballots takes a lot of time, according to Ion Sancho, a retired 28-year veteran elections supervisor from Leon County, Florida, and a key election expert in the 2000 presidential race election recount.\n\nFirst, signatures on the outside of an envelope must be verified before the ballot is opened and the vote counted. If there is anything wrong with the paper ballot \u2014 a paper tear or bend that prevents it from scanning properly \u2014 the ballot must be duplicated by hand, checked by another person, and verified by a three-person panel before it is counted.\n\nSince expanding the use of mail ballots after the 2000 election, Florida did not change their deadlines for certifying election results, something that puts election officials under enormous pressure, according to Sancho, who recalls falling asleep sitting upright doing this work.\n\n\"The problem is not fraud; the problem is legislatively drawn timelines,\" Sancho told NBC News.\n\nClaim: \"honest vote count is no longer possible\"\n\n\"An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!\u201d Trump continued in the same tweet.\n\nNot according to election experts.\n\nDespite the vote counting process taking time, Sancho said there are provisions are in place to keep vote counts from being corrupted.\n\n\"Every elections office has a secure area with security where ballots are stored. Voter ballots are stored in one area, blank ballots are stored in another area. We are very security conscious,\" he said.\n\nWhat's more, election night results will never be used despite Trump's assertion, Sancho noted. The first official results are the ones counted by noon on the Saturday after an election.\n\nElection workers place ballots into electronic counting machines, on Nov. 11, 2018, at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Florida. The Florida recount began Sunday morning in Broward County. Joe Cavaretta / South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP\n\nClaim: Scott's margin shrunk due to nefarious activity\n\n\"Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they \u201cfound\u201d many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. \"'The Broward Effect.' How come they never find Republican votes?\" Trump wrote in another tweet.\n\nScott did lead by a strong margin on election night, but as mail-in and provisional ballots continued to be counted \u2014 particularly in Democratic-leaning Broward County \u2014 his margin shrunk.\n\n\"These are not found ballots, they are ballots that were not processed until after the Election because they came in the day of the election!\" Sancho said.\n\nWhile problems and irregularities have been reported \u2014 including 22 ineligible ballots that were mistakenly counted, for instance \u2014 there's no evidence of any kind of criminal meddling.\n\nBroward County is an easy target for Republicans crying fraud. A federal judge ruled this spring that election administrator Brenda Snipes violated state and federal laws by destroying paper ballots from a 2016 primaries too soon, and ordered two election monitors to watch over Snipes' handling of the 2018 election.\n\n\"Our staff has seen no evidence of criminal activity at this time,\" a Department of Elections spokesperson told the Miami Herald this weekend of the monitors. Florida's Department of Elections is within the Florida Department of State, which is led by a Scott appointee.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement official told NBC News on Friday that they are \"not actively investigating\" any voter fraud right now.\n\nClaim: Palm Beach County's 'characters' are a problem, too\n\nTrump's Tuesday tweet also cited another left-leaning urban county, Palm Beach County, as a problem.\n\n\"The characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to 'find' enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!\" he wrote.\n\nSancho said Palm Beach's problems are not because of their current staff: Despite requests for funding to buy new voting machines, the third-largest county is saddled with outdated voting machines that can only process one race at a time, something that will make meeting the state's recount deadlines almost impossible.\n\n\"It's an incredible nightmare. Every county besides Palm Beach can feed all the ballots through the sorters and the sorters can program and (process) all three statewide races at onetime, except Palm Beach which is going to have to feed all 600,000 of their ballots separately for each recount,\" he said. \"All bets are off.\"\n\nSancho said the statewide deadlines are simply too short, and other states with mail-in ballots have much longer period for election staff to certify election results: California has 28 days, he told NBC News, \"which is why they do it pretty well!\"", "Family files civil rights lawsuit over police shooting death of armed security guard copied!\n\nThe family of Jemel Robeson, a security guard at a lounge outside Chicago, has filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Midlothian Police Department and an unnamed officer who shot and killed the 26-year-old early Sunday morning.\n\nRead More", "Stan Lee, creator of legendary Marvel comic book superheroes, dies at 95 copied!\n\nLee created or co-created most of the roster of Marvel superheroes, including Spider-Man, Black Panther, Iron Man, and Thor.

Google first changed its policy on Thursday in response to a widespread walkout by employees following a report from The New York Times that executives credibly accused of sexual misconduct left the company with tens of millions of dollars in exit packages and allowed a third to stay on before he later resigned.\n\n\"Today, we are announcing changes that reflect conversations we have had with employees and outside experts,\u201d Airbnb said in a statement on Monday. \u201cWe are a company who believes that in the 21st Century it is important to continually consider and reconsider the best ways to support our employees and strengthen our workplace.\u201d\n\nThe statement, which was first sent to BuzzFeed News, announced that the company will \u201cnot require our employees to use arbitration in cases involving discrimination in the workplace\u201d as well as \u201csexual harassment.\u201d\n\nJulianne Whitelaw, eBay's head of corporate communications, confirmed Monday that the company made a similar adjustment, scrapping private arbitration for sexual harassment claims in order to \u201cbetter reflect and encourage eBay\u2019s values of being open, honest and direct.\u201d\n\nThe Times report resulted in a swift backlash from employees who staged walkouts at the company\u2019s global offices around the world. Among the demands posted by the event\u2019s organizers was a call to end forced arbitration on cases of harassment and discrimination \u2014 a policy that CEO Sundar Pichai told employees Thursday would only partially change.\n\n\u201cWe will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims,\u201d Pichai wrote in an email to Google employees.\n\nAccording to Pinchai, the tech giant may still recommend arbitration as the \u201cbest path for a number of reasons,\u201d including personal privacy, but will leave the choice up to employees.\n\nFacebook issued a similar change the following day in an internal post to employees, saying that arbitration for sexual harassment and misconduct will now be optional.\n\n\u201cToday, we are publishing our updated Workplace Relationships policy and amending our arbitration agreements to make arbitration a choice rather than a requirement in sexual harassment claims,\u201d Anthony Harrison, Facebook's director of corporate media relations, said in a statement.\n\nAmong the stipulations concerning relationships in the workplace is a rule requiring that executives such as company directors report any relationships with employees to human resources.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment is something that we take very seriously and there is no place for it at Facebook,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nOther tech companies including Twitter have said they do not need to adjust their policies, which never included forced arbitration.\n\n\u201cJust to be clear, we don't force arbitration and never have,\u201d the company announced through Twitter Monday evening after initially declining to comment on the matter. \u201cWe support our employees.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Chris Pizzello / AP\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s claim on Monday, one of the fire officials in charge of battling Southern California\u2019s Woosely Fire, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby, said he found it \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re in extreme climate change right now,\" Obsy said. \"We\u2019re doing all that we can to prevent incidents and mitigate incidents and save lives.\"\n\nUniversity of Utah fire scientist Philip Dennison said that researchers know that mismanagement isn\u2019t to blame because some of the same areas now burning were charred in 2005 and 2008.\n\nThey aren't \"fuel-choked closed-canopy forests,\" Dennison said.\n\nIn those earlier fires, Paradise was threatened but escaped major damage, he said. In the current blazes, the town was virtually destroyed.\n\nThe other major fire, in Southern California, burned through shrub land, not forest, Dennison said.\n\n\"It's not about forest management,\" he said. \"These aren't forests.\"\n\nThe dean of the University of Michigan's environmental school, Jonathan Overpeck, said Western fires are getting bigger and more severe. He said it \"is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests, woodlands and grasslands with ever-worsening climate change.\"\n\nWildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming, fire scientists said. The average number of U.S. acres burned by wildfires has doubled over the level from 30 years ago.\n\nAs of Monday, more than 13,200 square miles have burned. That's more than a third higher than the 10-year average.\n\nThe two fires now burning \"aren't that far out of line with the fires we've seen in these areas in recent decades,\" Dennison said.\n\nA vehicle drives through smoke from a wildfire near Pulga, California on Nov. 11, 2018. Noah Berger / AP\n\n\"The biggest factor was wind,\" Dennison said in an email. \"With wind speeds as high as they were, there was nothing firefighters could do to stop the advance of the fires.\"\n\nThe wind is so strong that fire breaks \u2014 areas where trees and brush have been cleared or intentionally burned to deprive the advancing flames of fuel \u2014 won't work. One of the fires jumped over eight lanes of freeway, about 140 feet, Dennison said.\n\nSouthern California had fires similar to the Woolsey fire in 1982, when winds were 60 mph, but \"the difference between 1982 and today is a much higher population in these areas. Many more people were threatened and had to evacuated,\" Dennison said.\n\nCalifornia also has been in drought for all but a few years of the 21st century and is now experiencing its longest drought, which began on Dec. 27, 2011, and has lasted 358 weeks, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Nearly two-thirds of the state is abnormally dry.\n\nThe first nine months of the year have been fourth-warmest on record for California, and this past summer was the second-hottest on record in the state.\n\nBecause of that, there are 129 million dead trees, which provide fuel for fires, said wildfire expert Kristen Thornicke of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\nAnd it's more than trees. Dead shrubs around the bottom of trees provide what is called \"ladder fuel,\" offering a path for fire to climb from the ground to the treetops and intensifying the conflagration by a factor of 10 to 100, said Kevin Ryan, a fire consultant and former fire scientist at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nWhile many conservatives advocate cutting down more trees to prevent fires, no one makes money by cutting dead shrubs, and that's a problem, he said.\n\nLocal and state officials have cleared some Southern California shrub, enough for normal weather and winds. But that's not enough for this type of extreme drought, said Ryan, also a former firefighter.\n\nUniversity of Alberta fire scientist Mike Flanigan earlier this year told The Associated Press that the hotter and drier the weather, the easier it is for fires to start, spread and burn more intensely.\n\nIt's simple, he said: \"The warmer it is, the more fire we see.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, a state with a history of lynchings, refused to answer questions Monday about her \"public hanging\" remark after it went viral Sunday, drawing swift condemnation even as she insisted there was no negative connotation.\n\nHyde-Smith, who appeared at a news conference alongside GOP Gov. Phil Bryant to announce an endorsement from anti-abortion rights group the National Right to Life Committee, faced repeated inquiries about her comment, only to defer to her previously issued statement each time.\n\n\"Obviously I'd like to ask the senator about the public hanging comment,\" one reporter asked.\n\n\"We put out a statement yesterday and we stand by the statement,\" Hyde-Smith responded.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Tupelo, Mississippi, on Nov. 2, Hyde-Smith said, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row,\" referring to a man next to her who was identified as a local rancher.\n\nFootage of the remark was first posted on Sunday.\n\nMany understood the comment to have a link to lynching and the state's history of racial violence. Between 1882 and 1968, 581 lynchings took place in Mississippi, the most of any state in that period, according to the NAACP.\n\nShortly after the remark gained traction, Hyde-Smith released a statement saying she \"referred to accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement\" and \"used an exaggerated expression of regard.\"\n\n\"Any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous,\" she added.\n\nAsked to expand on that statement Monday, clarify what she meant, and if she was familiar with Mississippi's history of lynching, Hyde-Smith, who is set to take on African-American Democrat Mike Espy in a runoff election for her Senate seat later this month, insisted that she had nothing more to add.\n\nReporters at the news conference then turned to Bryant, who appointed Hyde-Smith earlier this year to serve as a replacement for longtime Sen. Thad Cochran, who retired. She is currently running to serve the remaining two years of his term.\n\nAsked what he thought of Hyde-Smith continuing to point to her statement as her lone response to questions about the comment, Bryant said Hyde-Smith was \"certainly addressing the fact that she has put out a statement.\"\n\n\"I could tell you all of us in public life have said things on occasion that we could've phrased better,\" Bryant added. \"When you make as many speeches as we do in public life, that does occur. But I know this woman, I know her heart and I knew it when I appointed her. I know it now. She meant no offense by that statement. There was nothing in her heart of ill-will.\"\n\nEspy said Hyde-Smith's comment was \"reprehensible\" and served as proof of why she is unfit to serve Mississippi\n\n\"We need leaders, not dividers, and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state,\" he said.\n\nNAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson, who is from Mississippi, said in a statement that Hyde-Smith's \"decision to joke about 'hanging,' in a state known for its violent and terroristic history toward African-Americans, is sick.\"\n\n\"To envision this brutal and degenerate type of frame during a time when Black people, Jewish People and immigrants are still being targeted for violence by White nationalists and racists is hateful and hurtful,\" he added.\n\nHyde-Smith's electoral battle with Espy is heading to a runoff after neither candidate broke 50 percent on Tuesday. Both candidates ended up with a total of just more than 40 percent of the vote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned for Hyde-Smith in Mississippi last month. A former state agriculture commissioner and state senator, Hyde-Smith was a Democrat until 2010, when she switched parties. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress.\n\nEspy, meanwhile, would be the first black man to serve as a senator from Mississippi since Reconstruction and the first Democrat since 1989.\n\nThe runoff election will take place on Nov. 27.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 13, 10:52 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the town in Mississippi where Republican Sen.

Then, one night I was followed by a group of men. Fortunately I made it home unscathed, but my appetite for solo jogs was spoiled after that. I guess it was the last straw. I was already exhausted by the aggressive male behavior I had to endure: catcalling, heckling and lewd propositioning.\n\nThese disturbing incidents were random, uncontrollable and at times terrifying. I\u2019ve known so many women who can relate, and now I know even more after researching this article.\n\nNone of these women succumb to fear. They recognize that they can\u2019t control what others do, that there\u2019s no such thing as \u201casking for it\u201d, and that you can take all the safety precautions in the world and still end up a victim. But they don\u2019t give up what they love, an attitude that inspires me to get my sneakers back on and go for it, with some handy tips in mind.\n\nRisk aversion is the key here \u2014 not risk elimination (which is impossible)\n\nPart of what helps women runners stay confident is taking safety precautions. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re guaranteeing their safety (that\u2019s not possible), or that anyone who has been hurt or worse while running could have been spared had they taken more precautions (that\u2019s victim-blaming).\n\nWhat it does mean is that they\u2019re having better, less stressful workouts by practicing risk-aversion.\n\n\u201cIt is probably smart for women to have a certain level of risk aversion while they run because they are vulnerable targets to predators,\u201d says Laura Dugan, Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland. \u201cWith risk aversion, they can make decisions that will reduce their vulnerability and consequently allow them to enjoy their running.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how to practice risk-aversion when running alone as a woman:\n\nRun in populated areas in the day time\n\n\u201cPredators will [typically] only attack when nobody else is around,\u201d says Dugan. \u201cWhile it might be nice to run in the woods, perhaps [women] can choose to run in a more popular park where others will be around. Also, women should avoid running at night.\u201d\n\nLauren Crain, a woman runner, has a firm policy around this.\n\n\u201cIf I'm running on a path, and I don't see anyone else for more than five minutes, I never run on that path anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel a lot safer when there are other runners or bikers around, and if I don't see anyone for more than five minutes, I'll usually turn around and go back.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re new to an area, and not sure where to run, Tina Willis, a personal injury attorney and avid distance runner for nearly 20 years, recommends asking neighbors and even dropping by your local police station to learn what trails local officers recommend.\n\nAlso, given her expertise in personal injury law, Willis stresses to not forget about another serious threat to all runners: drivers.\n\n\u201cI cannot overstate the importance of staying off road shoulders, especially really narrow or non-existent ones,\u201d she says.\n\nSo, choose an area populated by people, not cars.\n\nDitch the earbuds\n\n\u201cOne important thing I have changed in my running routine is that unless I am around a lot of people or running on the boardwalk during the day, I no longer put headphones on,\u201d says Christie Maruka, a fitness enthusiast who runs/speed walks daily. \u201cHeadphones playing music [is distracting] and I would zone out listening, and [thus be unable to] hear if someone is coming up behind me or at me. As much as I enjoy running to music it\u2019s really not safe.\u201d\n\nCrain makes a compromise.\n\n\u201cWhen I go running, I wear my broken headphones,\u201d she says. \u201cThe right earbud doesn't work, so I can still be aware of my surroundings.\u201d\n\nAt night, Crain ditches the earbuds altogether, feeling that the mere appearance of them make her appear like she\u2019s not aware of her surroundings, \u201cso I want to limit that view of me especially when it's semi-dark outside.\u201d\n\nCarry pepper spray only if you\u2019re trained to use it\n\nMaruka also keeps her keys in her hand as a ready weapon, while many other women (myself included when I\u2019m walking the dogs alone at night) carry pepper spray or another weapon.\n\nThis may help you feel safer, but Dugar discourages women from carrying weapons \u201cunless they are well trained on how to use them. This includes pepper spray and knives.\u201d\n\nDugar\u2019s reasoning is mainly that your weapons can actually be used against you by an attacker. Moreover, she points out, pepper spray expires, so if you are trained to use it, and confident doing so, make sure it\u2019s not past date.\n\nSusan MacTavish Best the founder and CEO of Living MacTavish, carries a large stone in one hand.\n\n\u201cI did this on the island of Port-Cros after I heard a wild boar,\u201d says Best. I look at it both as a way for me to feel more confident and as a bonus, it [makes] my arm stronger.\u201d\n\nLet someone know where you are and use GPS tracking\n\n\u201cI always share my location when I go running,\u201d says Crain. \u201cI let my partner know where I'll be, and share my location with him via Google.\u201d\n\nJen McMahon, a certified integrative nutrition health coach, certified personal trainer and running coach, also makes a habit of letting people she trusts know when and where she\u2019s running.\n\n\u201cCreate a check-in system with a buddy so they know you made it home safely,\u201d she suggests.\n\n\u201cAlways carry your charged cell phone with you while running,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere are new safety apps with GPS tracking that will dial the police or friend/family member for you if needed with just one click.\u201d\n\nNail these self-defense maneuvers\n\n\u201cIf you are ever attacked while running, use your powerful voice. Shout, yell, curse and do whatever you can to momentarily shock your attacker into changing their mind,\u201d says Jennifer Cassetta, a clinical nutritionist, personal trainer and self defense expert who founded Stilettos and Self Defense.\n\nIf things get physical, Cassetta describes tactics you can use to take an attacker down:\n\nIf grabbed or pulled or attempted to [be thrown] to the ground, drop your center of gravity to help keep your balance. Get in a wider than normal stance so you won't be knocked down easily.\n\nThen acquire and fire: Acquire the most effective soft targets (on a male attacker) and fire away. Those three targets are: eyes, throat and groin.\n\nJab fingers into the eyes.\n\nPunch straight to the throat to disrupt breathing.\n\nPunch or knee the groin in hopes to loosen up a grab or hold on you.\n\nKeep firing away until you have a moment to possibly escape. All the while, be sure to try and dodge or block any blows coming to your head and face.\n\nIf thrown to the ground, try to remember that the tools you have standing are the same ones you have on the ground and you can still fight back. Keep firing away with your hands, fists, and kick with your legs. You can use your hips to throw an attacker off of you.\n\nJoin/start a local running group that addresses your concerns\n\nSome of us just really like to run at night, but as Dugar pointed out, women are vulnerable to predators, and they are most vulnerable at night when alone. Running in a group is the easiest way to handle this, but why not take it a step further by joining or forming a local movement that is determined to empower women and involve men through conversation and action.\n\nYou may be able to turn to your workplace to get things off the ground.\n\n\u201cMy co-workers and I decided to start a movement, called Despite the Dark, where we shed light on the safety issues women face when they run, specifically at night,\u201d says Rachel Colonna, a creative studio designer and a founding member of the Despite the Dark team, who found that women co-workers were feeling more afraid of running after recent events such as the murders of runners Wendy Martinez and Mollie Tibbets, respectively.\n\n\u201cOur biggest takeaway is that there is safety in numbers, which is why we are creating a community of runners to ensure a safe environment,\u201d Colonna says. \u201cSadly, there is no way to be 100 percent safe all the time, but starting a conversation and a community is a way we have coped with the severity of these situations and started to find an answer.\u201d\n\nMore tips and tricks for a better run\n\nWant more tips like these?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Pete Williams\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The state of Maryland asked a federal judge on Tuesday for an order declaring that Rod Rosenstein is the acting attorney general \u2014 not Matt Whitaker, who was appointed to that position last week after the forced resignation of Jeff Sessions.\n\nIf the judge does as Maryland asks, ruling that Whitaker cannot serve as attorney general, it would be a blow to President Donald Trump, who bypassed Rosenstein in favor of someone who has repeatedly criticized Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian election meddling.\n\nThe Justice Department would immediately appeal any such ruling, and the case could be on a fast track to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhitaker's appointment has been widely criticized because he now oversees the special counsel's investigation into Russian election meddling and the president. While serving as a conservative commentator, he questioned the scope of the investigation and said there was no Trump campaign collusion with the Russians. For that reason, several congressional Democrats have urged him to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller's investigation.\n\nMaryland's attorney general, Brian Frosh, a Democrat, argues in court documents filed Tuesday that if Trump had the kind of authority the White House claims, he could fire the attorney general \"then appoint a carefully selected senior employee who he was confident would terminate or otherwise severely limit the investigation.\"\n\nMaryland says that Whitaker's selection by Trump violated federal law and exceeded the appointment authority in the Constitution.\n\nTrump named Whitaker acting attorney general under a law known as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. It allows a president to fill a vacant Cabinet position with a senior employee of the affected agency. Whitaker fits in that category, because he had been the chief of staff to Sessions.\n\nBut Maryland urges the judge to rule that a separate federal law actually governs what happens when the office of attorney general is vacant. It provides that the deputy attorney general takes over, which would be Rosenstein. As the state sees it, the Vacancies Reform Act is more general law, which must give way whenever a specific law provides for filling a Cabinet-level vacancy.\n\nThe state also argues that the appointment of Whitaker violates a provision of the Constitution that specifies top positions in the government can be filled only through presidential nomination and confirmation by the Senate. Because Whitaker's nomination bypassed that process, the state says, he cannot serve as acting attorney general.\n\n\"It is troubling, to say the least, that the president is attempting to fill a 'vacancy' he created himself with a 'temporary' appointment that might last for many months or years,\" says Frosh, \"especially when, as there, the temporary appointee has not been confirmed by the Senate.\"\n\nMaryland's legal papers say Whitaker's appointment marks the first time since 1868, when Congress passed a succession law for the Justice Department, that someone named to be acting attorney general was not already serving in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nThe state's motion comes in a lawsuit over the future of Obamacare, seeking a ruling that the Affordable Care Act remains enforceable despite attempts by the Trump administration to shut it down. The case is the mirror image of a lawsuit filed by Texas and 17 other states. It asks a different federal judge to declare that the health care law is no longer enforceable.\n\nMaryland's Obamacare lawsuit named several defendants, including Sessions, who was attorney general when the case was filed in September. With Sessions gone, Maryland says, the judge overseeing the lawsuit should declare that the attorney general defendant is Rod Rosenstein, not Matt Whitaker.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

In his three-minute video, which garnered more than 3 million views since it was first posted, Wahls stood in front of the Iowa House of Representatives to defend his lesbian moms\u2019 right to marry.\n\n\u201cMy family really isn\u2019t so different from yours,\u201d Wahls, a University of Iowa student at the time, said in his speech opposing a resolution that sought to ban same-sex marriage in the state. \u201cAfter all, your family doesn\u2019t derive its sense of worth from being told by the state, \u2018You\u2019re married, congratulations.\u2019 No, the sense of family comes from the commitment we make to each other, to work through the hard times, so that we can enjoy the good ones.\u201d\n\nNow, nearly eight years later, the 27-year-old Wahls is fresh off a victory for a seat in the Iowa State Senate, where he defeated his Libertarian opponent by more than 50 percentage points. The senator-elect, one of the youngest in the state, said he\u2019s humbled to have been elected by those in his community.\n\n\u201cIt sends a pretty powerful message of how far and how fast families like mine, that have one or more LGBT parents, have come in America,\u201d Wahls told NBC News on Monday.\n\nHis desire to run for elected office was driven by a motivation not dissimilar to the one that compelled him to stand up for his moms\u2019 right to marry each other.\n\n\u201cIt was more than anything else about standing up and doing the right thing, and obviously our politics can use more of that,\u201d Wahls said.\n\nStarting in January, Wahls, a Democrat will represent the Iowa upper chamber\u2019s 37th District, which sits in the eastern part of the state, not far from the Illinois border. Members of the Iowa State Senate serve four-year terms and are not subject to term limits.\n\nAfter Wahls won, the senator-elect posted a message to Twitter calling for bipartisanship in the state\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThere are many priorities Democrats and Republicans should be able to work on together,\u201d he stated. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the single mother who can\u2019t afford affordable health insurance and is thinking about leaving Iowa. I\u2019m thinking about the farmer whose markets for exports and shrinking.\u201d\n\nIn his post, Wahls then vowed to \u201cfight for everyone who, like my family, have been left out or left behind or used as a political target.\u201d\n\nWahls first announced his desire to run for office in December of 2017, saying he was doing so \u201cfor one simple reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an all-hands-on-deck moment that will determine the future of our state for generations to come, and I feel responsible for doing my part,\u201d Wahls said in a statement at the time. \u201cOur state has a choice to make. Are we going to let Republicans continue their attacks on healthcare, education, and workers\u2019 rights or are we going to stand and fight for the values that have defined this state for hundreds of years?\"\n\nOn Monday, Wahls admitted Donald Trump\u2019s presidency was a factor in his decision to run.\n\n\u201cI felt after the 2016 election a responsibility to do as much as I could to try and turn things around,\u201d Wahls explained. \u201cWhen the opportunity to run for the State Senate seat opened up, I felt I had a responsibility to do the most that I could, which in this case was running for the State Senate.\u201d\n\nPrior to pursuing politics, Wahls completed his bachelor\u2019s degree and then went on to attain a master\u2019s degree from Princeton. He also remained an advocate for LGBTQ rights: He published a book in 2013 about his family, titled \u201cMy Two Moms,\u201d and has been involved with a number of organizations dedicated to gay rights, including Scouts for Equality and the Family Equality Council. One of his most recent projects, The Rainbow Letters, is an online collection of letters written by the children of same-sex parents.\n\nWahls said he is looking forward to fulfilling his campaign promises to Iowans on health care, education and workers\u2019 rights once he takes office, but he also said he\u2019s working toward a national-level goal.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump lied about being the most friendly LGBT president in history. He made that promise, and it\u2019s a promise he broke,\u201d Wahls said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that LGBT folks and allies come together to make sure we remove him from office in 2020 in the election.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "Get the Mach newsletter.\n\nBy Seth Shostak\n\nRadio has long been the mode of choice when it comes to searching for aliens, and potentially conversing with them.\n\nBut radio\u2019s not the only game in town. A recent paper in The Astrophysical Journal suggests a different tack. In it, two researchers at MIT argue that it might be easier for cosmic residents to be found if they mark their position with bright lights.\n\nThe idea of signaling with light is hardly new. In the 1990s, scientists involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) considered the following hypothetical setup: Step one \u2014 find the world\u2019s most powerful laser. Step two \u2014 focus the laser with a telescope having a mirror at least 10 meters in diameter, producing a beam narrower than a twin bed. Step three \u2014 intermittently flash the laser, with each flash lasting a millionth of a second or so.\n\nThe brain-boggling result? This titanic laser pointer would produce a pulse that would outshine the sun, even when seen from light-years away. Obviously, it would do so only during that microsecond flash. And it would be visible only to someone in the laser\u2019s beam. But the idea that a piece of 21st century technology could momentarily outshine 500 million billion watts of sunlight is a stunning factoid, sure to impress the nerd set.\n\nIf humans could do this, maybe some aliens are already doing it. This possibility has prompted a small handful of so-called \u201coptical SETI\u201d experiments that have searched \u2014 and continue to search \u2014 for very short pulses of light from the heavens. But in their new paper, James Clark and Kerri Cahoy suggest that it might be more interesting to build a different sort of light signal: one that doesn\u2019t just occasionally flash but is always on. The mother of all porch lights.\n\nHow would this work? Once again you begin with a powerful laser \u2014 one running at several million watts. And you\u2019d use a laser that shines in the infrared, not in visible light. Again, a massive telescope would be used to focus the laser, producing a beam that the researchers reckon could be detected from as far away as 20,000 light-years \u2014 an always-on indication of someone\u2019s presence.\n\nIn most places in the galaxy, there are about 10 billion star systems within that distance, so this beam could reach a lot of worlds.\n\nThere are big advantages to using infrared light. It passes unhindered through the dust and gas that fill interstellar space. And stars like the sun don\u2019t naturally produce much infrared light, making a bright infrared laser on any orbiting planet stand out more. (Note that from light-years away, the light from the star and the planet would appear to come from the same place.) Any astronomer measuring the light from such a system would see an excess of infrared and quickly deduce that something \u201cnon-natural\u201d was going on.\n\nOf course, a real porch light shines in all directions. The highly focused laser proposed by the MIT scientists would only shine in one. So, if earthlings were to build one of these things with the idea of announcing Homo sapiens\u2019 presence, we\u2019d really have to incessantly reposition it, pointing at one star after another, hoping to stir up some benign interest at the other end.\n\nThere are no plans to construct this device now. The MIT scientists were engaging in a thought experiment to see if an always-on laser beam was feasible. Well, apparently it is, and might offer an effective scheme to find company among the stars. We\u2019d only need to fire up our laser, shine a little light on the aliens and wait for them to get back to us. Of course, that wait could be decades, centuries or more.\n\nMind you, not everyone is enthusiastic about constructing a bright beacon that tells others we\u2019re home. It might just provoke hostile action by peevish extraterrestrials. But even if we decide against putting a marker light on Earth, it\u2019s possible that other, less paranoid galactic societies have done so. And it\u2019s a simple experiment to search for the type of modified star shine such technology would produce.\n\nObviously, we should be looking. Maybe someone has left the light on for us.\n\nWANT MORE STORIES ABOUT THE SEARCH FOR ALIENS?\n\nFOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The counts are in line with publicly available tracking reports. This is not breaking news and does not change the math.

Under state law, if no candidate gets a majority of votes, a runoff is required.\n\nNBC News has yet to make a call in the race.\n\nThe Kemp campaign's push for a concession comes after the Democratic Party of Georgia and Abrams' campaign filed a lawsuit in federal court on Sunday challenging rejected votes. The lawsuit, filed against interim Georgia secretary of state Robyn Crittenden and various county election officials, aims to make election officials accept rejected provisional ballots that have incomplete or missing information if they can verify voter information through additional means.\n\nIt also challenges the rejection of more than 1,000 absentee ballots for missing or mismatching information, such as birth dates or addresses. Finally, the lawsuit asks a federal judge to delay the certification deadline a day \u2014 from Tuesday to Wednesday \u2014 to allow more time to fully count the votes.\n\nAbrams's campaign is hoping that once all the votes are counted, Kemp's lead will drop below the 50 percent threshold and trigger a Dec. 4 runoff election. If Abrams is able to gain slightly more than 23,700 votes, the race would be pushed into a mandatory recount.\n\nKemp has claimed that there are not enough outstanding provisional ballots to narrow his lead and force a recount or a December runoff. Kemp's campaign has said that 21,190 provisional ballots are still outstanding, which is in line with the unofficial numbers reported by the secretary of state's office.\n\nKemp, who served as Georgia's secretary of state until abruptly resigning last Thursday, declared victory shortly after Election Day and began preparing his transition.\n\nAbrams's campaign has argued that their findings show an extra 5,000 uncounted provisional ballots as of Saturday morning. Abrams has vowed to keep going despite pressure for her to concede, saying \"Georgia still has a decision to make.\"\n\n\"We will continue to fight for each and every eligible vote to be counted because in a democracy, every vote should be valued,\" Lauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams' campaign manager, said Saturday. \"Georgians deserve nothing less.\"\n\nKemp faced charges of attempted voter suppression during the campaign and demands from Democrats that he step aside as Georgia's chief elections official, which he dismissed.\n\nAnd on Monday, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Brian Schatz of Hawaii released a joint letter asking the Justice Department's civil rights division to investigate claims of voter suppression in the race.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice still has the authority and the obligation to enforce the Voting Rights Act and protect the right to vote,\u201d the senators said in a statement. \"In the case of Georgia's election, the DOJ should ensure that all votes are counted and that voters have a meaningful opportunity to ensure their absentee and provisional ballots are counted; and conduct a thorough investigation into the potential voting rights abuses that have been reported before, during, and after the election.\"\n\nThe letter specifically takes aim at the state's \"exact match\" law, which requires information on voter registration applications to precisely match information on file with the state's Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration. An Associated Press investigation in October found that Kemp's office had 53,000 voter registration applications pending under the protocol.\n\nAbrams and several civil rights groups filed a lawsuit against the practice during the campaign and won a partial victory in October to allow more than 3,000 people whose voter registrations were put on hold over possible citizenship issues to vote.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Jonathan Allen\n\nIf Andrew Gillum ends up as the next governor of Florida, his post-election gymnastics will have been worth it.\n\nBut for now, a narrow defeat \u2014 close enough to trigger a recount under Florida law \u2014 may be the worst possible outcome for a rising star in the Florida and national Democratic parties who had briefly found the political silver lining in a graceful exit after a close race.\n\nOn Election Night, Gillum conceded the contest to Republican Ron DeSantis. His decision was rendered with the alacrity and upbeat notes of a candidate who knew he'd be back on the ballot \u2014 and it stood in contrast to the bitter fight that Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., who also trailed his Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, started to mount immediately.\n\nBut on Saturday, with the vote gap having closed considerably, Gillum reversed himself.\n\n\"I am replacing my earlier concession with an unapologetic and uncompromised call to count every vote,\" he said.\n\nThe conundrum for Gillum was both straightforward and a bit of a political straitjacket.\n\nIf he had stuck to the initial concession, he might have enhanced his standing with swing voters who don't want a drawn-out process \u2014 at the cost of disappointing dedicated Democrats in Florida and around the country. By pushing the process forward, even reluctantly or with less vigor than Nelson, he may please his core constituency but signal to swing voters that he's a sore loser \u2014 the exact opposite of the message sent by his concession.\n\nEither decision carried risk.\n\nBecause Florida is once again the center of national political attention, these themes \u2014 Gillum as protector of the rights of voters in heavily minority parts of Florida, or partisan Democrat unwilling to accept the results of the election \u2014 figure to have implications whether he has designs on state or federal office down the road.\n\nHis camp says his actions on election night and since have been responsible and geared toward ensuring the sanctity of the 2016 election \u2014 not positioning himself for any other bid for office.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s so much thinking about his future whether it\u2019s statewide, nationally or within the party. I think it\u2019s a bright future,\" said one Gillum adviser who spoke to NBC on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the topic on the record.\n\n\"While the race isn\u2019t over yet, his top priority is making sure that the will of the people is heard, and that means making sure that every vote is counted, and I don\u2019t think that is going to do anything to hurt him in the future,\" the Gillum adviser said. \"I think he\u2019s being an adult here.\"\n\nBut Gillum has tread much more lightly when it comes to litigation than Nelson, a 75-year-old three-term senator who seems unlikely to run for office again if he loses his seat \u2014 or, if he ultimately wins and wants to seek re-election, has six years to repair any damage.\n\nNelson and Gillum are playing something of an inside-outside game, with Gillum working the grassroots.\n\nGillum has let Nelson take the lead on litigation, but he\u2019s remaining actively engaged with his political base. He held a rally at a black church in Ft. Lauderdale Sunday night and had another event planned in Palm Beach Monday. And it is Gillum\u2019s supporters who have faced off against Trump backers outside the Broward County supervisor of elections\u2019 office.\n\nBarry Richard, an attorney for Gillum, told NBC's Hallie Jackson Monday that Gillum is reluctant to engage in legal action if some Florida's counties aren't able to complete their vote counts by the 3 p.m. Thursday deadline but noted that the candidate is \"reviewing his options\" and that a lawsuit has always been \"on the table.\"\n\n\"As of this morning, we had a discussion in which he wants to receive advice as to what options he has,\" Richard said on MSNBC. \"What Mayor Gillum is concerned about at this point is, whether or not it ultimately would affect his race, that he feels an obligation to ensure votes are counted and not to sit back when we are learning that they are not being counted for a number of reasons.\"\n\nWith Republican and Democratic operatives and lawyers being recruited to travel to Florida to observe vote-counting for the second time in two decades, it's not entirely clear how the rest of the plot will play out for Gillum, Nelson, DeSantis and Scott.\n\nBut Gillum, faced with the toughest set of choices of the four \u2014 the two Republicans could and did declare victory while Nelson doesn't have to worry about rubbing voters the wrong way \u2014 has cast his lot on the side of not surrendering unless he remains behind after all the votes have been counted, recounted and perhaps tallied a third time.\n\nHe has to hope that, if he is defeated, voters can accept the explanation that demanding a full count was about standing up for the rights of Floridians rather than for himself.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Barry McCaffrey told NBC News. \"In the short term, North Korea is the most consequential threat to U.S. national security we're facing....They have nuclear weapons, they have delivery systems, they are not going to denuclearize. So I think the outcome of all of this is we're loosening the economic constraints on these people and we're kidding ourselves.\"\n\nThe private report released Monday said researchers had identified 13 of an estimated 20 undeclared North Korean missile bases, and included a detailed analysis of one facility, the Sakkanmol Missile Operating Base, about 50 miles north of the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea.\n\nThe report was prepared by a group called Beyond Parallel, a program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. It was led by Victor Cha, a former diplomat who was considered by the Trump administration for the job of ambassador to South Korea, but could not get on board with Trump's approach.\n\nSeparately, Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, provided NBC News with his group\u2019s analysis of one of the most important facilities, located near Yeongjeo-dong, deep in the interior of North Korea and extending to the Chinese border.\n\nThe location makes it a strong candidate for basing North Korea\u2019s longest range missiles, Lewis has concluded. The site has been identified by defectors, but Lewis found it on satellite imagery and observed work ongoing there as recently as last year.\n\n\u201cThe missile facility at Yeongjeo-dong remains an active military base, with a number of hardened and underground structures for launching ballistic missiles,\u201d Lewis wrote. While one defector said it was built to house medium-range Nodong missiles, \u201cother evidence suggests the site was constructed to house longer range-missiles that would need to be rolled out from tunnels, erected and launched.\"\n\nAfter Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a historic summit in Singapore in June, North Korea did not agree to stop working on its nuclear program. Instead, Kim signed a vague declaration agreeing to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\" a phrase that was not defined.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that a second summit between the two leaders would be scheduled as part of diplomatic talks that he described as promising. But even as these talks have been ongoing, North Korea continues to work on its nuclear program.

Kevin Lim / EPA file\n\nAnswering questions after a speech in Louisville in September, Haspel noted that Kim Jong Un's government views nuclear weapons as \"essential to their regime's survival.\"\n\nTrump, in a June tweet, declared that \"There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,\" a view that is not shared by any of his top national security officials, or the American intelligence community.\n\nNBC News reported in June that U.S. intelligence agencies had detected that North Korea has increased its production of fuel for nuclear weapons at multiple secret sites even as Trump and Kim were meeting \u2014 and that Kim would seek to hide those facilities as he tries to extract concessions in nuclear talks with the Trump administration.\n\nThe Washington Post corroborated that story, reporting that intelligence agencies had concluded that North Korea \"does not intend to fully surrender its nuclear stockpile, and instead is considering ways to conceal the number of weapons it has and secret production facilities.\"\n\nNorth Korea has offered to dismantle a missile site even as it has been improving other sites in full view of American spy satellites, underscoring the regime's continued work on its missile programs, officials tell NBC News. Experts also say they have no reason to believe North Korea has stopped production of nuclear fuel.

The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home.\"\n\nExperts say, however, that the global sanctions regime on North Korea has weakened in recent months, in part because Russia and China have stepped up trade with North Korea.\n\nMany observers argue that Trump has been played by Kim.\n\nA Digital Globe satellite image taken on March 29, 2018 shows what the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Beyond Parallel project reports is an undeclared missile operating base at Sakkanmol, North Korea.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Pete Williams\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump faces a growing backlash over his choice of Matt Whitaker to serve as acting attorney general, with liberal and conservative legal experts questioning the appointment.\n\nThe controversy arises because Whitaker was serving Jeff Sessions as the attorney general's chief of staff but had not been confirmed by the Senate, and because a federal law specifies that the deputy attorney general takes over when there's a vacancy at the top of the Justice Department.\n\nBut in making the choice, Trump bypassed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had been overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Whitaker appears to be the first person named acting attorney general who was not already serving in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nThe president acted under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the latest version of a law on the books since 1868. In its current form, it says the president can fill a vacant position at a Cabinet department in one of three ways \u2014 designating the deputy to take over, choosing someone nominated by the president and confirmed by the president for a different job, or naming someone serving in a senior position in the relevant agency for at least 90 days.\n\nWhitaker fits the third category, because he was named chief of staff to Sessions more than a year ago, in September 2017. His previous Senate confirmation for U.S. attorney in Iowa doesn't count for the purposes of the Vacancies Reform Act, because he stepped down from that position in 2009.\n\nHowever, a separate federal law specifies that \"in case of a vacancy in the office of attorney general, or of his absence or disability, the deputy attorney general may exercise all the duties of that office.\" So which law governs? It's an issue the courts have never resolved, leaving a cloud over the Whitaker's selection.\n\nMost of the legal criticism of the appointment, however, has been based on a concern that it violates the Constitution. Article II Section 2 gives the president authority to appoint \"officers of the United States\" with the advice and consent of the Senate. Courts have long made a distinction between principal officers, who require confirmation, and others in lower-level jobs, who do not.\n\n\"Principal officers like heads of departments have to be Senate-confirmed,\" Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration, said. \"Our founders put that in for a reason, because you don't want the president's lackey to be serving in such an important role.\"\n\nJoining Katyal in that view is conservative lawyer George Conway, whose wife, Kellyanne, is a senior Trump adviser. In an opinion column in The New York Times, Katyal and Conway said that because Whitaker has not had a Senate confirmation hearing, \"there has been no mechanism for scrutinizing whether he has the character and ability to evenhandedly enforce the law in such a position of grave responsibility.\"\n\nThey cite a concurring opinion written last year by Justice Clarence Thomas in a case about the qualifications of a senior official in another federal agency. \"The appointments clause forbids the president to appoint principal officers without the advice and consent of the Senate,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nSome liberal scholars, while criticizing the selection of Whitaker on other grounds, have nonetheless said the appointment was constitutional. They cite another Supreme Court ruling that said someone acting temporarily in a Cabinet-level job is not a principal officer and therefore doesn't have to be confirmed.\n\nIt appears that the issue of who can be acting attorney general has never arisen before, because every person to accept that assignment has been serving in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nDuring the past 54 years, six of them have been the deputy attorney general. Others were in other senior Justice Department positions. One, Dana Boente, was a U.S. attorney who was acting attorney general for about a month after Trump fired Sally Yates \u2014 who was acting attorney general while the Senate considered Sessions' nomination.\n\nIn the 1800s, a secretary of Interior and a secretary of the Navy were each named acting attorney general for a few weeks.\n\nThe legality of Whitaker's appointment will probably soon stop being a purely academic question. Local and state officials are already talking about challenging it in court.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Alyssa Newcomb\n\nA battle is literally brewing between Pabst and MillerCoors, who were in court Monday to argue a case that could make or break the future of Pabst Blue Ribbon.\n\nFor the past two decades, MillerCoors has been brewing Pabst\u2019s legacy beers, including Pabst Blue Ribbon, Old Milwaukee, Lone Star, and Natty Boh. The two companies signed a brewing agreement in 1999 that is set to expire in 2020, with two options to renew. Without a renewal of that agreement, Pabst would likely have to halt production of many of its famous brands.\n\nThere\u2019s just one big problem. MillerCoors says it has less capacity for brewing and is not obligated to renew the deal. Pabst is arguing that MillerCoors, which has been facing declining brand volume in the United States, is trying to drive the competition out of business.\n\nThe nearly half-billion-dollar trial will be heard by a jury in Milwaukee County Circuit Court and is expected to last until Nov. 30. In addition to more than $400 million in damages, Pabst is asking for MillerCoors to work \u201cin good faith\u201d to help find a solution, even if the company no longer has enough capacity.\n\nIn 2016, MillerCoors closed a 1.3 million square foot brewery in Eden, North Carolina, which had the capacity to brew more than 8.8 million barrels of beer per year. Pabst said it needs 4 to 4.5 million barrels each year.\n\nBut MillerCoors isn\u2019t sure it can help. The company previously said it may have to close one location in California that has the capacity to brew 6 million barrels of beer per year. If that happens, it would leave MillerCoors with six breweries.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Pabst alleged MillerCoors \u201cwillfully breached our 19-year agreement in an effort to stomp out the competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though MillerCoors\u2019 market power is much larger than Pabst\u2019s, we will not allow this industry bully to push us around,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are confident that the court will see MillerCoors\u2019 fabricated \u2018capacity\u2019 concerns for what they are: a thinly veiled, bad faith attempt to unlawfully hurt a competitor.\u201d\n\nMillerCoors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPaul Gatza, director of the Brewers Association, said he hasn\u2019t seen the agreement between MillerCoors and Pabst. However, \u201ca company that does not control its own beer production capacity would be at risk as the time of agreement winds down, particularly if there isn\u2019t capacity at other breweries that would allow one company\u2019s needs to be satisfied by other companies\u2019 excess capacity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawsuit comes at a time when beer sales are declining. Overall beer sales were down 1 percent last year, while craft beer sales were up 5 percent, according to the Brewers Association.\n\nIn its third quarter earnings report last month, Molson Coors, the parent company of MillerCoors, reported net sales are up 1.8 percent. However, MillerCoors has lost 3.3 percent brand volume in the United States this year, largely due to declining sales of its light beers, which include Coors Light and Miller Lite.\n\n\u201cWe know you want and need us to fix these brands because they\u2019re the biggest driver of our collective volume and profit,\u201d said Gavin Hattersley, CEO of MillerCoors, in a blog post last month. \u201cAnd we\u2019re working to do that by revitalizing (them) with authentic positions that build respect for our beers.\u201d", "White wooden crosses memorialize Thousand Oaks shooting victims copied!\n\nA community grieves around white wooden crosses that are set up for the victims of the Thousand Oaks shooting in California.

As a teen, Lee said he was working odd jobs to help his parents pay the bills, when he heard about the position.\n\n\"I must've been the only one who applied because I got the job, and I thought it would be a temporary job,\" Lee said in 2011. \"I had never thought of writing comics.\"\n\nComic book creator Stan Lee strikes the Spiderman pose as he poses after receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles on Jan. 4, 2011.

Rick Scott, to recuse himself from \"any role\" in the recount process that will determine the winner of their race.\n\nIt's \"obvious that Scott cannot oversee this process in a fair and impartial way,\" Nelson said in a two-minute video released by his campaign.\n\n\"And, thus, he should remove himself from any role in the recount process so the people can have confidence in the integrity of the election. Given his efforts to undermine the votes of Floridians, this is the only way that we can ensure that the people's votes are protected.\"\n\nThe recount is overseen by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner, a Republican who was appointed to his position in 2012 by Scott.\n\nNelson accused his GOP opponent of not being \"interested in making sure every lawful vote is counted\" and of \"using his power as governor to try to undermine the voting process.\" The Democrat pointed to Scott's suggestion, without evidence, that rampant \"voter fraud\" may be taking place in the Democratic strongholds of Broward and Palm Beach counties.\n\n\"He's stood on the steps of the governor's mansion and tried to use the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the Broward elections chief,\" Nelson said. \"He's filed lawsuits to try to stop votes from being counted and to impound voting machines. The reason he's doing these things is obvious: He's worried when all the votes are counted, he\u2019ll lose the election.\"\n\nNelson's video comes as the recount battle between him and Scott has heated up. On Election Day, Scott appeared poised to defeat the longtime incumbent. But as more votes have been counted in counties such as Broward and Palm Beach, Scott's lead has narrowed to the point where, under Florida law, an automatic machine recount is triggered.\n\nThat recount began this weekend and must be completed by Thursday, though lawsuits filed by both Scott and Nelson's camps could complicate that timeline.\n\nA spokesman for Scott responded to Nelson Monday, saying in a statement that Democrat is \"once again confused.\"\n\n\"The recount is being managed by the individual and independent Supervisors of Elections in all 67 counties,\" the spokesman added. \"If Bill Nelson has an issue with the way the recount is being run, he should take it up with them.\"\n\nRepublicans such as Scott and President Donald Trump have insisted that Democrats are trying to \"steal\" the election, with each suggesting that rampant voter fraud could be taking place in the key Democratic-leaning counties.\n\n\"Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties,\" Scott said Thursday. \"We've all seen the incompetence and the irregularities in vote tabulations in Broward and Palm Beach for years. Well, here we go again. I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.\"\n\nNo evidence of such fraud has been brought forth. State election officials said they have not seen any evidence of fraud.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Scott holds a lead of about 13,000 votes, while former GOP Rep.

White\n\nSaudi Arabia could cut its crude oil output by as much as 1 million barrels a day, said Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih on Monday. The announcement came as members of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries this weekend suggested a production cut, after oil prices unexpectedly tumbled by nearly $15 per barrel over roughly the past month.\n\nDemand hasn\u2019t kept up with expectations thanks to slower economic growth in many parts of the world, and the expected impact of Iranian sanctions was muted due to last-minute waivers granted by President Donald Trump to several countries that buy Iranian oil.\n\n\u201cMy sense is we may have seen the bottoms for crude or something very close to it,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see higher numbers \u2014 maybe not as high as early October \u2014 but we\u2019ll see some higher numbers,\u201d he said.\n\nEnergy market experts suggest that the actual size of any cut announced next month could wind up being lower than a million barrels, since OPEC will need the cooperation of non-member Russia, which has expressed a reluctance to drive oil prices higher.\n\n\u201cIf Russia says, \u2018We\u2019re in with OPEC,\u2019 that\u2019s the key to holding it,\u201d said John Hall, chairman of Alfa Energy, a U.K.-based consulting company. \u201cRussia isn\u2019t too keen on high oil prices [and] it doesn\u2019t particularly want to give the U.S. shale industry a boost.\u201d\n\nRussian energy minister Alexander Novak expressed a wait-and-see demeanor over the weekend, according to CNBC. \u201cRight now we shouldn't be making any hasty decisions. We need to look at the situation very carefully to see how it will develop so that we don't end up changing our course by 180 degrees every month,\u201d he said on Sunday.\n\nThe good news for American drivers, though, is that the low gasoline prices they have been enjoying lately shouldn\u2019t be impacted in the short term, Kloza said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to slow down these gas price decreases between now and Thanksgiving,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to unilaterally influence global prices receding thanks to rising Russian and American oil production, a Saudi think tank recently published a report looking at an oil market without OPEC.\n\nRussian support for Saudi Arabia\u2019s OPEC goals is a key element keeping the cartel alive, Hall said. \u201cI think if they fell out with Russia, the whole OPEC thing would really start to fall apart and it really wouldn\u2019t have the credibility or the clout it currently has,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you start looking at the bigger picture there\u2019s such a lot going on there,\u201d Hall said. In addition to economic considerations, geopolitical tensions over American foreign policy pertaining to Iran, Israel, and the culpability of Saudi Arabia in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi also factor into the balancing act.\n\nFloating the idea of a global oil market untethered by a central governing body could be viewed as a scare tactic by a kingdom eager to reassert its relevance in the market. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe a warning,\u201d Hall said. \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t someone controlling the price to some extent, you\u2019d have a free for all\u2026 Life without OPEC would present more problems than life with OPEC.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Facebook said the selection was up to the French presidency.\n\nIt is unclear whether the group will have access to highly-sensitive material such as Facebook's algorithms or codes to remove hate speech. It could travel to Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin and global base in Menlo Park, California if necessary, the company said.\n\n\"The best way to ensure that any regulation is smart and works for people is by governments, regulators and businesses working together to learn from each other and explore ideas,\" Clegg said.\n\nFrance's approach to hate speech has contrasted sharply with Germany, Europe's leading advocate of privacy.\n\nSince January, Berlin has required sites to remove banned content within 24 hours or face fines of up to 50 million euros ($56 million). That has led to accusations of censorship.\n\nFrance's use of embedded regulators is modeled on what happens in its banking and nuclear industries.\n\n\"(Tech companies) now have the choice between something that is smart but intrusive and regulation that is wicked and plain stupid,\" a French official said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

They are able to deal with stress, overcome obstacles and inspire others to work toward collective goals. They manage conflict with less fallout and build stronger teams. And they are generally happier at work, too,\u201d according to a 2016 article on the topic in the \u201cHarvard Business Review.\u201d\n\nWhat is emotional intelligence?\n\nThough it sounds like corporate mumbo jumbo, emotional intelligence was first established by psychologists as a way to understand if there were different types of intelligence, other than what\u2019s known as \"general intelligence.\"\n\nA paper, co-authored by John D. Mayer, a leading emotional intelligence researcher and professor of psychology at University of New Hampshire, claims that emotional intelligence suggests solid social functioning because people have an easier time tuning into the feelings of others, understanding their perspectives, and are better at communicating and regulating their behavior.\n\n\u201cI was very interested in how emotions were important to problem solving,\u201d says Mayer. \u201cWhat if there was an intelligence that gave credence to people\u2019s emotions?\u201d Mayer says, though emotional intelligence is related to general intelligence, it\u2019s not \u201ca lockstep connection.\u201d \u201cThe jury is out if emotional intelligence is one ability or actually several,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople with general intelligence seem to be able to reason socially. People with emotional intelligence seem to have better relationships with people and fewer issues with problematic and aggressive behaviors. Most researchers would say that social intelligence should exist, but as of now there\u2019s no way to measure it successfully.\u201d\n\nEmotions are a big part of what makes us human. The problem is when we let temporary feelings and moods rule our decision-making, leading us to say or do things we later regret.\n\nJustin Bariso, author of \u201cEQ Applied: The Real-World Guide to Emotional Intelligence,\u201d defines emotional intelligence as a process of learning to understand and manage emotions in order to make decisions that are more in harmony with your true beliefs and values. \u201cEmotions are a big part of what makes us human. The problem is when we let temporary feelings and moods rule our decision-making, leading us to say or do things we later regret,\u201d he explains.\n\nEmotional intelligence can help you make wiser decisions\n\nKnowing how we feel about things \u2014 and having an idea of how others might feel \u2014 can be socially and intrinsically empowering. \u201cOur emotions influence our decisions on everything \u2014 from what career path to follow, to where we will live, to who we choose to spend our lives with,\u201d Bariso says. \u201cEmotional intelligence, when combined with other factors, can help you make wiser decisions, leading to a happier, more purposeful life.\u201d\n\nEmotional intelligence can also help you harness negative emotions like anger, fear and sadness, explains Bariso. \u201cFor example, if we\u2019re sad or angry there\u2019s a reason for it. Identifying those emotions and their root causes can help motivate us to make changes for the better,\u201d he says.\n\nEmotional intelligence, when combined with other factors, can help you make wiser decisions, leading to a happier, more purposeful life.\n\nWith good intentions, an understanding of what makes people tick can be a very positive thing. But a 2011 study discusses the \u201cJeckyll and Hyde\u201d aspect of emotional intelligence, when this understanding is used to mask your own emotions in order to \u201cadvance interpersonal deviance,\u201d or, use what you know about others to manipulate them to your own ends.\n\nBariso feels the insights one can glean from emotional intelligence can arm you against these Machiavellian types. \u201cThat\u2019s just one more reason you should continue working on your own EQ (emotional intelligence quotient), so you can recognize and protect yourself from these attempts to manipulate and control,\u201d he says.\n\nEmotional intelligence takes practice\n\nBoth Mayer and Bariso say, to a degree, emotional intelligence can be learned. \u201cMost of us learn algebra in school \u2014 our teachers give us the formulas and we learn how to apply them. We can do that with emotional intelligence, too. We don\u2019t have to figure it all out ourselves but with teaching we can improve our capacity to understand how we operate in ourselves and with others,\u201d Mayer says.\n\n\u201cMuch of how we respond emotionally are habits that we've repeated over and over for years. The first step is to understand how your emotions work, and how those habits influence you. Then, with time and practice, you can actually change those habits and increase your ability to manage emotions,\u201d says Bariso.\n\nShould you develop your emotional intelligence?\n\nMayer says it all depends on if you feel you need to. \u201cSome people are emotional and some people are not emotional,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a normal continuum. We need people who are less squeamish to be first responders, and the same is true of those emotional intelligence. People with emotional intelligence contribute to the arts, communication and interpersonal relationships. If a person is having trouble in relationships, if they are having trouble with emotions, if they\u2019re angry all the time, or if they have no idea how they feel about things and would like to know, then emotional intelligence might be worth looking into,\u201d he says.\n\nThe biggest benefit of emotional intelligence? Empathy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to learn how to think and feel from another person\u2019s perspective, especially since it can be easy to misinterpret facial expressions and expressions of emotion. For example, a smile can mean joy or sadness, depending on the context,\u201d explains Bariso. \u201cBut one of the best ways to develop empathy is to ask plenty of questions and do more listening than talking. Over time, you\u2019ll get better at reading others while recognizing that things aren\u2019t always how they appear.\u201d\n\nAll told, Bariso says, to maximize your emotional intelligence, you have to keep at it. \u201cThere\u2019s no lifetime certification. Just like a musician or athlete must continue practicing, you\u2019ve got to continue reflecting and applying what you\u2019ve learned,\u201d he says. Just as long as you use what you learn for the greater good.\n\nMORE FROM BETTER\n\nWant more tips like these? NBC News BETTER is obsessed with finding easier, healthier and smarter ways to live.

Andelman, visiting scholar at the Center on National Security at Fordham Law School\n\nLast April, the leaders of the three Baltic republics stopped by the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris for a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron en route back home from their visit with Donald Trump in Washington. Their concluding press conference with Trump had been described by Guardian journalist Ben Jacobs as \u201ca concert by a hastily-assembled Motown covers band.\u201d\n\nBut the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania told Macron an even more damning story. It seems that before they walked out to meet the media, Trump had devoted much of their private meeting to berating them on their role in the wars in Yugoslavia. (Trump\u2019s wife Melania and her family hail from the region.) Trump rambled on about the Balkans and how terrible they were, without ever realizing that his guests were leaders of the three Baltic republics \u2014 all members of NATO and all located the opposite end of Europe. He concluded by encouraging the heads of state to try to get along with Russia, which has repeatedly threatened each of them.\n\nWhat could have been a sober show of international cooperation and a reaffirmation of transatlantic alliances instead became, once again, an example of America\u2019s tarnishing reputation abroad.\n\nMacron was reportedly horrified by Trump\u2019s gaffe and has lately begun telling the story to other visitors at the Elys\u00e9es. According to Le Monde, the incident has only confirmed his view of Trump as an ignorant bully \u2014 a view that was no doubt confirmed this past weekend as world leaders converged on France to mark the 100th anniversary of the armistice ending World War I. What could have been a sober show of international cooperation and a reaffirmation of transatlantic alliances instead became, once again, an example of America\u2019s tarnishing reputation abroad.\n\nThe debacle began, as so many involving the U.S. president do, with a tweet. Trump slammed the French president, badly misconstruing what Macron had actually said about the need for a European defense force (Macron was calling for more cybersecurity, not an army \u201cto protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia.\u201d)\n\nIt went downhill from there. Once on the ground in Paris, it quickly became quite clear that Trump\u2019s attitude would be coloring much of his stay in Paris. First, there was Trump\u2019s sudden decision not to visit the American cemetery outside Paris at Belleau Wood, site of one of the most horrific battles of World War I in which around 1,800 Americans gave their lives. The White House blamed his absence on a terrible, but it turned out non-existent, rainstorm.\n\n\u201cA view of the weather in Paris which is supposed to have deterred @realDonaldTrump from paying his respects to the brave American soldiers who gave their lives for freedom at the AisneMarne war cemetery this afternoon,\u201d a Macron confidant, Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, tweeted with a shot of a lone cyclist a few blocks from where Trump was holed up in the American ambassador\u2019s residence. \u201cNothing a cyclist can't handle, let alone a presidential helo.\u201d\n\nScowling his way through lunches and dinners, Trump appeared miffed that he had to be there in the first place \u2014 neither valued nor the center of attention among the more than 60 world leaders who were guests at Macron\u2019s party. Arguably, Trump was only in Paris because he had been unable to get his own Veteran\u2019s Day parade in Washington. The Pentagon had priced at up to $92 million the extravaganza he\u2019d ordered after watching Macron\u2019s lavish Bastille Parade in Paris last year.\n\nBut the icing on the cake was Trump\u2019s arrival at the Sunday ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in his own mini-motorcade, separated from the other heads of state who marched, arm-in-arm, up a heavily-policed Champs-Elys\u00e9es. (This decision was due to security concerns, according to the White House.) The only other leader not to march with the rest? Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhile Macron and Trump were once dubbed a \u201cbromance\u201d in the media, the contrast between the two could not have been more dramatic during the weekend\u2019s events. While Trump sulked in his room, Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel drove out to the forest at Compi\u00e8gne where, on Nov. 11, 1918, Germany and the allied powers signed the armistice that ended the bloodiest war in history until that moment.\n\nMacron tweeted a photograph of himself and the German leader, with a single word caption: \u201cUnis\u201d (United). French television carried more footage of the two moving through the memorial and into a replica of the railway car where the armistice had been signed. At one point Merkel, who herself had grown up under harsh communist rule in East Germany, took Macron\u2019s hand and squeezed it, clearly emotional. Macron put his arm around her.\n\nTrump tried to make up for his absence with a hasty trip to the American cemetery Suresnes on Sunday. But it was all too little, too late. While other world leaders gathered in the afternoon to kick off three days of the Paris Peace Forum, Trump was already en route back to America.\n\nIt was not hard to see why he\u2019d skipped it. The forum represents everything Donald Trump does not. As the organizers described it: \u201cinternational cooperation is key to tackling global challenges and ensuring durable peace.\u201d The theme, globalism, was reflected in both Macron\u2019s keynote at the Arc de Triomphe and Merkel\u2019s Peace Forum message.\n\nIronically, globalism was also the concept preached by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson throughout the 1919 peace conference that led to the Treaty of Versailles. America needed to stay engaged with the world, Wilson said. It did not, and a few decades later a massive international war was again wreaking havoc across the planet.\n\nToday, European leaders seem determined to prevent another tragedy by charting a course independent of the U.S. So why should we care? Trump may preach nationalism, but America desperately needs loyal, determined partners if it is to keep nuclear arsenals out of the grasp of Iran and North Korea; if it is to hold at bay the growing threat of a dangerous Russian-Western arms race; if it is to bring a halt to hostilities in Syria and Yemen that threaten America\u2019s allies and friends across the Middle East; and if we are to bring an end to trade wars that threaten to sap our economic vitality.\n\nIt is beyond time for Trump to chart a new path, now that he finds himself in a deep hole with America\u2019s long-standing allies. Quite simply, he must stop digging. It is the wisest, perhaps the only, course.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

So I have to disagree with the, I think, overall description of this video being doctored as if we put somebody else\u2019s arm in there.\u201d\n\nThe video came from a news conference on Wednesday in which Acosta attempted to ask President Donald Trump questions about possible indictments by special counsel Robert Mueller. Trump attempted to ignore Acosta and move to a different journalist, but Acosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, declined to give up the microphone when a White House intern reached for it.\n\nLater that evening, Sanders tweeted out a video that appeared to show Acosta bringing his arm down on the arm of the intern during the tense exchange, a motion that Conway told Wallace \"looked like a karate chop almost.\u201d\n\nThe White House later suspended Acosta's press access, with Sanders claiming Acosta \"put his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern.\" Sanders appeared to have been trying to back up that claim with the sped-up video.\n\nWallace pressed Conway on the White House\u2019s tumultuous week with the press, in which Trump suggested he may need to look at pulling credentials for other journalists who fail to show \u201crespect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the White House, this is a very sacred place for me, a very special place,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday. \u201cYou have to treat the White House with respect. You have to treat the presidency with respect.\u201d\n\nThe White House has since stood by its decision to keep Acosta away from the White House, saying it was deserved given the way he had allegedly behaved at the press conference.\n\n\"We stand by our decision to revoke this individual's hard pass,\" Sanders tweeted Wednesday. \"We will not tolerate the inappropriate behavior clearly documented in this video.\"\n\nWallace asked Conway whether the president is looking at pulling credentials for reporters who write or ask questions the president doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cChris, if what you described was the standard, we would have cleaned out the entire building two years ago,\u201d Conway said. \u201cHe gets a lot of unfair treatment by the press.\u201d\n\nShe called Trump's comments Friday \"instructive.\"\n\n\u201cYou have to show respect to the White House, to the presidency certainly, to the president,\u201d Conway said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Now it\u2019s clear that even a little bit, such as taking the stairs instead of an escalator, can help improve health.\n\nIt was probably necessary to make the goals sound easier. Eighty percent of Americans fail to get enough exercise, the HHS said. That raises the risk of early death, the risk of depression and anxiety and the risk of diseases of aging, including Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe guidelines:\n\nAdults should move more and sit less.\n\nAdults need at least 2 1/2 hours to five hours a week of moderate intensity exercise or 1 hour, 15 minutes to 2 \u00bd hours of intense activity every week. These are minimums: More is better.\n\nAdults also need strength training of some sort two or more days a week.\n\nChildren aged 6-17 need at least an hour of exercise a day, including bone-strengthening exercise such as jumping rope.\n\nToddlers and small children need to keep active throughout the day, getting a minimum of three hours of light, moderate and intense exercise every day.\n\nExercise is essential for healthy aging and older adults should do as much as they can, including muscle-strengthening and balancing exercises, which can include dancing or group exercise classes.\n\nPregnant women need exercise too, including 2 \u00bd hours of moderate exercise every week.\n\nThe benefits of this much exercise:\n\nSmall children grow stronger bones and stay at healthier weights.\n\nOlder kids learn better.\n\nLower risk of eight types of cancer: breast, colon, lung, endometrial, bladder, esophageal, kidney, and stomach.\n\nBetter memory and thinking, reduced anxiety and depression risk, and improved sleep.\n\nLower risks of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.\n\nModerate-intensity activities include walking briskly at 2.5 to 4 mph, playing volleyball, or raking the yard, the guidelines read.\n\n\u201cExamples of vigorous-intensity activities include jogging or running, carrying heavy groceries, or participating in a strenuous fitness class. Some activities, such as swimming or riding a bicycle, can be either moderate or vigorous intensity, depending on the effort.\u201d\n\nIf you can still talk but cannot sing, the activity is moderate. If you have to take a breath before completing a sentence, the activity is probably intense.\n\nIntense activity counts for more. \u201cFor adults, a general rule is that two minutes of moderate-intensity activity counts the same as one minute of vigorous-intensity activity,\u201d the guidelines read.\n\nSchools really need to do more, said Russell Pate, an exercise expert at the University of South Carolina who helped draw up the guidelines.\n\n\u201cPart of the answer is to provide kids with high-quality physical education,\u201d Pate said at the news conference. Before-and after-school programs, active learning that allows kids to move around in the classroom and finding ways to help kids walk to bike to school safely can also help keep them active, Pate said.\n\nPolicies that help transform communities will also help, said Janet Fulton of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cEveryone should have the right to walk or bike in their neighborhood,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cEveryone should be able to walk from their homes to the park, or walk to work.\u201d", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Ten Israelis were treated for injuries related to rockets from Gaza, the head of volunteer-based emergency service United Hatzalah said, adding that crews were dealing with a high volume of calls from people suffering from injuries and emotional shock.\n\nSirens sounded across southern Israel amid the latest escalation of tensions between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that has controlled Gaza since 2007.\n\n\"Our fighter jets have started striking terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip,\" Israel Defense Forces said on Twitter. More than 20 Hamas military targets throughout Gaza have been struck by Israeli military so far.\n\nThe Israeli military also took responsibility for an airstrike that completely destroyed the Hamas-owned Al-Aqsa TV station in Gaza. The organization released video footage of the attack calling it \"a strategic Hamas terror target.\"\n\nHamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum called on journalistic organizations to denounce the attack saying that \"targeting the headquarter of Al-Aqsa TV Channel and demolishing the building down to the ground is a blatant aggression against journalism and all free voices that are dedicated to communicating reality.\"\n\nAn Israeli based journalist and editor-in-chief of +972 Magazine, Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man, tweeting,\"not only as a journalist who believes journalists should never be targets, but also as someone who lives within spitting distance of the IDF's own radio station (located in a residential neighborhood), I can't express enough outrage about the bombing of Al Aqsa TV in Gaza.\"\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office was meeting with senior security and military staff in the evening after cutting short a trip to Paris.\n\nHours earlier, an Israeli army officer and seven Palestinians, including a local Hamas commander, were killed after an incursion by Israeli special forces into Gaza.\n\nPalestinians and fighters of Ezz al-Din Al-Qassam brigades carry two bodies of Hamas fighters during their funeral in Khan Younis, southern Gaza on Nov. 12, 2018.

But there will be no immediate vote.\n\nCardinal Blase J. Cupich, of Chicago, suggested that the bishops hold a special assembly in March to vote on the measures after considering the results of the global meeting in February.\n\nAbuse scandals have roiled the Roman Catholic Church worldwide for decades, but there have been major developments this year in the U.S.\n\nIn July, Pope Francis removed U.S. church leader Theodore McCarrick as a cardinal after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Subsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported that they too had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults, triggering debate over who might have known and covered up McCarrick's misconduct.\n\nIn August, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailed decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, alleging that more than 1,000 children had been abused over the years by about 300 priests. Since then, a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia has begun working on a federal criminal case centered on child exploitation, and attorneys general in several other states have launched investigations.\n\nDiNardo, in his address opening the bishops' assembly, told survivors of clergy abuse that he was \"deeply sorry.\"\n\nThe church, he said, should not revictimize survivors \"by demanding they heal on our timeline.\"\n\nAnnouncement of a delay in the voting drew skeptical reactions.\n\n\"We had this agenda, we were moving forward on these documents, this was our goal,\" said Bishop Christopher Coyne, of the Vermont diocese of Burlington, and the communications chair for the three-day conference. \"And now ... it will look like we don't have to come up with much.\"\n\nCoyne said he believed there were \"no machinations\" leading to the delay, but he had concerns about how it would be perceived outside the assembly hall.\n\n\"The Vatican just made a big mistake in asking US bishops to delay their votes on clergy abuse protocols,\" tweeted John Gehring, the Catholic program director at Faith in Public Life, a Washington-based clergy network. \"The optics are terrible, and it sends a message, intended or not, that Rome doesn't recognize the urgency of the moment.\"", "By Alexander Kacala\n\nVoters in Wilton Manors, Florida, on Tuesday elected the state\u2019s first and the country\u2019s second all-LGBTQ local government.

But like so much of what Trump says, that\u2019s simply not true.\n\nThe reality is that Tuesday\u2019s election was truly a blue wave. In fact, it\u2019s getting bigger and bluer by the day. Since election night, Democrats have picked up even more seats as close races become finalized in their favor. As of now, Democrats have officially picked up 33 seats in the House. And with nearly a dozen House races still too close to call, Democrats could pick up closer to 40 when all is said and done.\n\nHow impressive is that? According to Axios, the last time Democrats won more House seats in a midterm election would be over 40 years ago, in 1974. And that was in large part a response to Watergate \u2014 the biggest political scandal of the modern era \u2014 and President Richard Nixon had just resigned in August of that year.\n\nAnd it gets better for the Democrats. They flipped seven governorships, including in the very red state of Kansas and knocked off former GOP presidential candidate and current Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.\n\nOverall, Democrats did better this year than the last Democratic wave in 2006 when then President George W. Bush deemed it a \u201cthumping.\u201d\n\nSure, the GOP will likely pick up a few Senate seats. But overall in this election, approximately 15 percent more Americans voted for the Democratic candidates for the Senate than for Republicans. And Democrats have just flipped another red Senate seat to blue in Arizona as Democrat Kyrsten Sinema officially defeated GOP opponent Martha McSally on Nov. 12. We are even seeing a likely recount in the Florida Senate contest between GOP\u2019s Rick Scott and incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson.\n\nIn total, Democrats did better this year than the last Democratic wave in 2006 when then President George W. Bush deemed it a \u201cthumping.\u201d That year, Democrats picked up 31 House seats, six governorships and six Senate seats. This time Democrats outperformed in terms of House and governor\u2019s wins.\n\nBut yet, there was a sense on election night as the results came in that Trump and the GOP had somehow prevented a wave election. I even heard firsthand from some fellow progressives who were practically despondent since we didn\u2019t see wins in the very visible races that myself and many others were emotionally invested in, such as Andrew Gillum in Florida, Stacey Abrams in the Georgia gubernatorial race and Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s improbable run for Senate in Texas. (As of now, there\u2019s still some limited hope for Gillum and Abrams, who are locked in races deemed \u201ctoo close\u201d to call.) And there was also the dream, against all rational odds, that Democrats would wrest control of the U.S. Senate \u2014 despite the cold, hard math that made this scenario highly unlikely.\n\nSo we didn\u2019t get the Senate. But Democrats need to savor this astounding victory nonetheless. It will truly have an impact, in big and small ways \u2014 and not just because we saved America from becoming more and more like Trumpistan.\n\nDemocrats now control the House for the first time since 2010. That means Democrats will set the agenda in that chamber, will have vast investigatory powers and every single committee will be chaired by a Democrat. No more Trump ally Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif, heading the House Intelligence committee and protecting Trump. In fact, Nunes told donors in a secretly recoded tape released in August that the GOP House majority was desperately needed to protect Trump. No longer.\n\nCome January 3, when the new Congress is sworn in, it\u2019s goodbye to GOP House control and hello to committee chairs who may finally be able to hold Trump accountable. For example, the House Intelligence committee will be chaired by vocal Trump critic Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, a former federal prosecutor who can be counted on to use his committee as a real check on executive power. Meanwhile Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif, a person Trump has publicly demeaned as having a \u201clow IQ,\u201d will likely head the House Financial Services Committee, where she will be able to subpoena officials at financial regulatory agencies for both information and testimony.\n\nAnd we can\u2019t forget the seven governors races Democrats won. This means positive changes can be expected quickly for citizens of Maine, Kansas and Wisconsin, where the candidates ran in large part on a promise to expand Medicaid in order to provide residents with health insurance. And importantly, after the census in 2020, a Democratic governor should be able to ensure that the GOP can\u2019t grotesquely gerrymander the congressional and state legislative districts in these states as well.\n\nIn other words, Trump can claim the results were a \u201cbig victory\u201d all he wants. The reality is that after the midterms' wave election, Democrats are now in a great position for the next big goal: winning back the White House.\n\nUPDATE (11/12/18, 8pm EST): This piece has been updated to reflect the final results of the Arizona Senate race.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

They netted the 23 seats needed to win the House, but they hadn\u2019t hit a number much larger than that. It was pretty clear they were going to fall short in the marquee gubernatorial races in Florida and Georgia, even though they picked up seven governors\u2019 mansions. And they looked destined to lose as many as four Senate seats to Republicans.\n\nSince then, however, the Democrats\u2019 performance in the midterms has looked much, much better. They appear on their way to picking up close to 40 House seats \u2014 the party\u2019s best showing since the post-Watergate midterms (their haul in 2006 was about 30 seats).\n\nRegarding the Senate contests, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., eked out a victory; Democrat Kyrsten Sinema is ahead of Republican Martha McSally by more than 30,000 votes in Arizona; and the Florida Senate race is headed to a manual recount, with Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., trailing Republican Rick Scott by just 12,000 votes.

The man she was referring to was identified as a local rancher. Hyde-Smith's opponent in the runoff is former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe video was posted by Lamar White Jr., the publisher of The Bayou Brief, a nonprofit news site in Louisiana. White told Mississippi Today that he did not take the video, and it was recorded on Nov. 2, before the election.

He banned a CNN correspondent from the White House, while threatening he would do the same to other journalists. And he accused election officials in Florida and Arizona of rigging the vote against candidates he had campaigned for,\u201d the New York Times said on Friday.\n\nAnd this morning, Trump fired off this tweet: \u201cThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged.

In an interview with The Associated Press, she said Long was a \"ticking time bomb\" who constantly lost his temper, threw tantrums and would scream at coaches when he didn't like their decisions. She said she once witnessed him assault a fellow coach.\n\nThat coach, Dominique Colell, said Long grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone. Another time, he used his hand to mimic shooting her, Colell said, adding that she feared for herself whenever she was around him.\n\nCluke said she also witnessed Long pretending to shoot Colell.\n\n\"When Dominique turned around and saw that, she turned pale as a ghost and it was very, very scary.\" Cluke said. \"Just sadistic. ... He was out of control. He would scream and cuss and his face would turn bright red and people would actually back away from him.\"\n\nLong, a 28-year-old former Marine machine-gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire during college night at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night. He killed 11 people and a police officer who responded, and then fatally shot himself, police said.\n\nAuthorities have not determined a motive.\n\nIan Long, 28, who is a veteran of the Marines, has been identified as the shooter at the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks, California. via Facebook\n\nColell kicked Long off the track team immediately after he assaulted her, but she and Cluke said the boy's track coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise Long's goal of joining the Marines. The head track coach, Cluke said, reversed Colell's decision to throw Long off the team and told her she didn't have that authority, while the now-retired principal brushed it aside as a one-time incident.\n\nLong rejoined the team after apologizing in front of several coaches and administrators.\n\nCluke said she, Colell, and her father, also a track coach at the school at the time, repeatedly reported Long's behavioral problems, to no avail.\n\n\"You need to do something about this kid. He needs some help.\" Cluke said she told administrators. \"And they're like, 'Well, he's got a good heart he'll be fine.

Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at the school and its district were unsuccessful Friday, when both were closed because of a massive and deadly wildfire in the area.\n\nCluke recalled a time when she and her father sat down with Long for a talk and asked him why he wanted to join the military. His answer, she said, \"is burned in my soul.\"\n\n\"He said he wanted to be in the Marines because he wanted to go fight in the war for our country and he wanted to kill for our country,\" she said. \"When you hear somebody say they want to be in the military because they want to kill people in the name of our country, that's chilling. It chilled me right down to my bones.\"\n\nShe said it's time for school administrators across the country to take behavioral problems seriously.\n\n\"It's not the military or video games or music that causes this,\" she said. \"It's the inaction of people in authority.\"\n\nShe said that if other coaches and school administrators had acted following complaints about Long, \"he could've gotten help and 12 innocent people wouldn't be dead now.\"\n\n\"The warning signs were there,\" she said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The jury for his case, which is expected to last four months, was whittled down from almost 1,000 prospective panelists.

Its thousands of members \"manufactured and imported multi-ton quantities of heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States,\" and \"generated billions of dollars in profit,\" much of it thanks to an elaborate transportation system that includes scores of intricate tunnels under the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"Smuggling drugs from Mexico to the United States became highly sophisticated under his watch,\" Avergun said, and he used his ruthlessness and cunning \"to consolidate his power and control\" over the cartel.\n\nIn court filings, prosecutors said Guzman \"and other leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel also employed 'sicarios,' or hitmen, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults, kidnappings, assassinations and acts of torture at (their) direction\" to maintain their power.\n\nJurors are expected to hear about a specific incident in 2006, where Guzman himself allegedly interrogated two members of a rival cartel. After eating lunch, \"he had them beaten and then personally shot them both in the head with a long gun. The defendant then ordered his workers to dig a hole in the ground, light a fire inside the hole, and throw the bodies in the hole to be burned and subsequently buried,\" court filings say.\n\nNumerous cooperating witnesses will be called by prosecutors but their identities have been kept under wraps in court filings to protect them and their families. Steps are also being taken to protect their identities in court.\n\n\"The stakes are larger here, because the defendant is known to target cooperators,\" said another former federal prosecutor, Andrew Porter, who was involved in putting another indictment against the drug lord in Chicago. \"There are certainly additional safeguards that need to be put in place.\"\n\nGuzman's defense is expected to challenge the witnesses' claims by focusing on their own lawbreaking.\n\n\"Unfortunately for many of these kinds of cases the government has to rely on people who committed crimes. You have to make deals with the devil, if you will, to find the people most responsible,\" Avergun said. She predicted prosecutors while try to corroborate witnesses' testimony with wiretaps and other evidence in a bid \"to relieve the jurors of the responsibility of relying only on drug dealers.\"\n\n\"With this kind of case, where the stakes are so high, they're going to pick their witnesses carefully,\" she said.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, have asked the judge presiding over the case, Brian Cogan, not to allow the defense to refer to a \"government official's recent comments\" calling cooperating witnesses \"'flippers' whose use probably should be illegal.\" That's a reference to comments President Donald Trump made during an interview with Fox News in August, after it was revealed his former lawyer was cooperating with the special counsel's investigation into alleged Russian collusion.\n\nSome of the evidence at trial will come courtesy of Guzman himself.\n\nProsecutors plan to show jurors video of Guzman carrying out an interrogation of \"a kidnapped and bound member of a rival cartel\" who was not killed, court filings say.\n\nThey also indicated in court papers they'll use a video Guzman had made to answer questions from \"Dead Man Walking\" star Penn and actress Kate del Castillo.\n\nActor Sean Penn shakes hands with Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman in Mexico, in this undated Rolling Stone handout photo obtained by Reuters on Jan. 10, 2016.

The only way to have money to buy food, to survive, is to grow poppy, marijuana, and at that age, I began to grow it, to cultivate it and to sell it.\"\n\nProsecutors also plan to use his history of dramatic escapes to counter the defense's contention that he was a low level figure in the cartel.\n\nAfter he was first captured in 1993 and sentenced to 20 years behind bars in Mexico, he continued to rule the cartel from prison \u2014 and was reportedly able to bribe guards into letting him go. He is said to have escaped in 2001 by being smuggled out in a laundry cart.\n\nAnd his dramatic escape from another high-security prison in Mexico in 2015 came courtesy of a mile long tunnel dug under his prison cell, which is estimated to have cost millions of dollars.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Rebecca Shabad\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 When Democrats take control of the House next year, they will find themselves with new powers to investigate and embarrass the Trump administration. But their ability to use those powers may be more limited than many progressive voters may imagine.\n\nThe liberal wish-list has been circulating for months, and Democratic base voters are hungry for results.\n\nSome Democrats say their top priority is obtaining President Donald Trump's tax returns, which he has repeatedly refused to release since 2016 because he's said they're under audit by the IRS. Many have their eyes set on unanswered questions surrounding Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, looking to employ subpoena authority to bring in current and former Trump advisers and secure key documents.\n\nOver the past few days alone, House Democrats have spoken of probing the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the president's possible role in hush money payments to alleged former paramours Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.\n\nAnd some voters \u2014 though few of the lawmakers who represent them \u2014 have expressed a desire for the House to deploy the thermonuclear presidential oversight option: impeachment.\n\nBut long before Election Day, Democratic leaders were looking to temper the most ambitious expectations of their caucus and their voters. With continued Republican control of the Senate, and a White House staunchly resistant to Democratic requests, the new House majority's road to stiffer oversight is likely to be littered with legal obstacles and hit dead ends \u2014 not to mention some tricky political terrain.\n\nTRUMP'S TAX RETURNS\n\nThe holy grail for the president's Democratic pursuers: the tax returns he first promised to release as a Republican primary candidate before appearing to effectively abandon the pledge as president. Now some congressional panels with the authority to obtain those documents \u2014 such as the House Ways and Means Committee, which has the ability to request a person's tax returns under the tax code \u2014 will be led by members with the desire to put those abilities to use.\n\nThe incoming Democratic chair of that panel could submit a written request to the IRS to provide the information. If the Treasury Department were to deny it, House Democrats would have to decide whether to pursue the tax returns through a legal route. If they were ultimately obtained, the chair would have to designate the panel's members as \"agents\" to read the returns. They would then have to vote to make the documents public and report them to the full House.\n\nIf the Treasury Department completely blocked the release of the records, \"that would be illegal,\" said David Cay Johnston, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and expert on Trump and tax law.\n\n\"The reason that would be illegal is that the statute says that they 'shall' produce the returns. It's not 'may' or 'can' or something else. It is a mandatory act,\" he said. \"Unless they get the most extraordinary partisan judge, then what will happen at the end of the day is very clear: They'll have to turn them over.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told The San Francisco Chronicle in early October that demanding the president's tax returns \"is one of the first things we'd do \u2014 that's the easiest thing in the world. That\u2019s nothing.\" Last week, Pelosi said that she'd leave it up to the committees themselves to decide.\n\nTrump, however, has already signaled that he's not interested in playing ball. If he's investigated, he said at a news conference Wednesday, hours after Democrats claimed their House majority, then Democrats could find themselves getting investigated right back, by Senate Republicans. What's more, he added: Policy deals could be off the table.\n\n\"If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing, and government comes to a halt, and I would blame them, because they now are going to be coming up with policy,\" he said.\n\nSUBPOENA POWER\n\nDemocrats will also have the subpoena power in their arsenal \u2014 and, based on their efforts in this congressional term, they're itching to use it.\n\nDuring Trump's presidency so far, congressional Republicans have blocked more than 52 subpoena requests by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, including requests for documents related to everything from alleged housing abuses by the company run by presidential son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner's family to the Justice Department's refusal to defend Obamacare in court.\n\nBut just because they can now issue subpoenas doesn't mean they will necessarily issue as many as some voters may expect \u2014 or that they can count on getting the information they're looking for anytime soon.\n\n\"Subpoena power is interesting,\" Pelosi said at a recent CNN event. \"To use it, or not to use it? It's a great arrow to have in your quiver in terms of negotiating on other subjects. But getting back to what we will do, what we will do is exercise oversight, which is the responsibility of the Congress of the United States, exercise oversight over the agencies of government, which this administration has completely walked away from.\"\n\nLaurence Tribe, constitutional law professor at Harvard, cautioned this week that the subpoena power wasn't a magical one. \"Hate to say it, but counting on a Democratic House's subpoenas to unlock all the secrets of this corrupt administration could prove na\u00efve,\" he tweeted. \"A Trumpified judiciary, expanded further with the Senate's acquiescence, might let the Trumpsters stonewall. So democracy remains endangered.\"\n\nAfter Republicans took control of the House in 2011, they issued subpoenas to the Obama administration on Operation Fast and Furious in which for two years, a branch of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed illegal gun sales in order to track sellers and purchasers.\n\n\"The White House tried to ignore our subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. We took them to court and won,\" said Kurt Bardella, who served as deputy communications director and senior adviser to Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., when he led the Oversight Committee.\n\nBut the road to a final victory was a long time coming.\n\nThe House started investigating the operation as soon as Republicans assumed the majority in 2011, ahead of President Barack Obama's re-election bid \u2014 but despite apparent judicial wins were still battling the Justice Department over documents long after Obama had left office.\n\nThe DOJ seemed to finally reach a settlement in 2018 \u2014 only to see that potential agreement thrown into question last month. And ironically, the Republican fight for Obama-era documents may have left Trump with fewer legal options in his own fight to keep documents from opposition investigators. If he opts to try, beyond legal issues, there can be political risks to stonewalling subpoenas.\n\n\"(Trump) will look like he is trying to hide something that he shouldn't be. He will be entering into unprecedented separation of powers territory,\" added Bardella. \"We use to say at Oversight, it's not the crime, it's the cover-up that gets you. By refusing to comply with the legislative branch's constitutionally protected oversight authority, Trump could do himself even more harm than the actual investigations would produce.\"\n\nThat is, if he were inclined to second-guess a politically risky maneuver.\n\nIMPEACHMENT\n\nSome Democratic members of Congress have floated the idea of impeaching Trump. But most haven't \u2014 including the party's leaders.\n\nIn an NBC News Exit Poll, a majority of voters in the midterm election this year \u2014 54 percent \u2014 said that they don't think Trump should be impeached, while 41 percent said he should.\n\nPelosi herself suggested in an interview with PBS NewsHour that aired on election night that impeachment won't be her focus \u2014 for now.\n\n\"It depends on what happens in the Mueller investigation,\" she said. \u201cBut (impeachment) is not unifying. And I get criticized in my own party for not being more supportive, but I'm not. If that happens, that would have to be bipartisan and the evidence would have to be so conclusive.\"\n\nBy introducing a seemingly impossible standard \u2014 bipartisan impeachment buy-in in a bitterly divided Washington \u2014 it might appear Pelosi was effectively ruling out the idea. She's been at pains to stress that she hasn't. \"Recognize one point,\" Pelosi told The Atlantic's Edward-Isaac Dovere Friday after the election. \"What Mueller might not think is indictable could be impeachable.\"\n\nIn the wake of the election this week, many Democrats said that any discussion of the \"I-word\" is premature.\n\n\"I haven't seen any evidence yet that would raise that, so it seems like you're skipping a few steps there,\" Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Pa., said on CNN. \"There's a special counsel who's looking at the whole problem. We need to give him the time and space to do his job, and at any time that he finishes and presents us with his conclusions, we'll make a decision at that point.\"\n\nRep.-elect Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., told MSNBC that she\u2019s not interested in impeaching the president. \"You know, I don't think that\u2019s the way forward.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., told NBC News last week: \"My sense was that health care was on the ballot and not impeachment. We should lead with the reasons the voters gave us the majority.\"\n\n\"But we shouldn't look the other way. If there's a line of evidence to pursue, we should pursue it and do it responsibly and put together an impenetrable case that could receive bipartisan support,\" said Swalwell, a member of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees.\n\nAnd as Hill Democrats are quick to point out, the odds of a Republican Senate voting overwhelmingly to remove a Republican president impeached by a Democratic House currently lie somewhere between slim and none. Meanwhile, as the Senate's GOP leader pointed out last week, his party paid a steep political price two decades ago for ignoring the partisan headwinds surrounding their decision to impeach a president.\n\nIn fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., warned House Democrats Wednesday that any Trump investigations under their new majority over the next two years \"might not be a smart strategy.\"\n\n\"The whole issue of presidential harassment is interesting. I remember when we tried it in the late '90s,\" he told reporters. \"We impeached President Clinton. His numbers went up and ours went down.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But now that the troops have been deployed, they may find themselves with very little to do, according to officials familiar with the plans.\n\nTroops are not allowed to apprehend immigrants like border agents do. For the most part, they are laying barbed wire barriers and erecting tent facilities for themselves and the Border Patrol. The only armed troops are military police, who are there to protect the encampments where troops are staying. While some troops will wear body armor, they will do so only for self-defense and will not directly interact with immigrants.\n\nThe operation, renamed this week from \"Operation Faithful Patriot\" to \"border support,\" will cost at minimum $200 million, estimates say, and the number of troops involved could rise to as many as 15,000, according to figures Trump has floated.\n\nTrump has said the troops are defending the border and called them a \"human wall.\" His critics have called it a campaign stunt designed to drive fear of immigration ahead of the mid-term elections.

A cause of death wasn't reported.\n\n\"Today we lost Douglas Rain, a member of our founding company and a hugely esteemed presence on our stages for 32 seasons,\" the company said. \"He will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.\"\n\nThe HAL 9000 computer was the sentient controller of life support, systems and \u2014 although it wasn't revealed until later in the movie \u2014 the very mission of Discovery One, the spacecraft that is sent to Jupiter to investigate a mysterious black obelisk in the landmark 1968 science fiction film directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nRain's sinuous, detached reading of HAL's lines made the computer's murders of three astronauts as they slept in suspended animation and its subsequent stranding of astronaut Frank Poole to die in open space all the more shocking.\n\nHAL's reasoning and explanation were cold, precise and \u2014 at least in its mind \u2014 unavoidably logical. He had been given conflicting programming: Ensure the success of the mission at all costs, while also protecting the lives of the crew. HAL concluded that the first command superseded the second.\n\n\"This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it,\" HAL quietly tells astronaut Dave Bowman before proceeding to explain matter-of-factly that it had learned of Bowman's and Poole's plans to disconnect it by reading their lips.\n\nThe red lens that served as the 'eye' of the HAL 9000 computer in '2001: A Space Odyssey' -- one of the iconic images in movie history.

In 1972, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Supporting or Featured Actor in a Drama for his performance as William Cecil in \"Vivat!

Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, requested that then-White House counsel Donald McGahn and a top Trump Organization executive provide all documents and communications related to reimbursements made by Trump or the Trump Organization to Cohen for the payments.\n\nAt the time, Cummings also requested all documents related to Trump's two most recent financial disclosures, zeroing in on a discrepancy related to how much money Trump paid Cohen as reimbursement for his original $130,000 payment to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nPointing to that letter, the Democratic aide said Democrats on the committee began probing the payments months ago, but did not receive any of the documents Cummings had requested \"because we were in the minority.\"\n\nThe aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the investigation, added, \"This should change now that we are in the majority.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on Democratic efforts to ramp up this probe.

Cohen, who pleaded guilty in federal court this year to two campaign finance violations stemming from the payments, paid Daniels $130,000 just weeks before the 2016 presidential election so she would stay silent about her allegations.

They reported that their findings came down squarely on the side of a warming ocean environment and a changing climate, and not excessive harvest by fishermen.\n\nOne of the ways warming has negatively impacted shellfish is by making them more susceptible to predators, said the lead author of the study, Clyde MacKenzie, a shellfish researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is based in Sandy Hook, New Jersey.\n\n\"Their predation rate is faster in the warmer waters. They begin to prey earlier, and they prey longer into the fall,\" MacKenzie said. \"These stocks have gone down.\"\n\nMacKenzie's findings, the product of a collaboration with Mitchell Tarnowski, a shellfish biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, appeared recently in the journal Marine Fisheries Review. The findings have implications for consumers of shellfish, because a declining domestic harvest means the prices of shellfish such as oysters and clams could rise, or the U.S. could become more dependent on foreign sources.\n\nThe scientists observed that the harvest of eastern oysters from Connecticut to Virginia fell from around 600,000 bushels in 1960 to less than 100,000 in 2005. The harvest of the four species declined from 1980 to 2010 after enjoying years of stability from 1950 to 1980, they found.\n\nThe scientists reported that a positive shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation led to the degradation of shellfish habitat. The oscillation is an irregular fluctuation of atmospheric pressure that impacts weather and climate, which in turn affects things like reproduction and food availability for shellfish.\n\nThe study mirrors what Maine clam harvesters are seeing on the state's tidal flats, said Chad Coffin, a clammer and the president of the Maine Clammers Association. Maine's harvest of softshell clams \u2014 the clams used to make fried clams and clam chowder \u2014 dwindled to its lowest point since 1930 last year.\n\nIt will take adopting new strategies, such as shellfish farming, for the fisheries to survive, Coffin said.\n\n\"Clammers aren't the reason there's no clams,\" he said. \"We need to adapt, we need to focus our efforts on adapting to the environment we have.\"\n\nSome near-shore shellfish harvests in the U.S. remain consistently productive, such as the Maine sea scallop fishery, which takes place in bays and coastal areas in the winter. The state's scallop fishery bottomed out at about 33,000 pounds in 2005, but has climbed in recent years, and its 2017 total of almost 800,000 pounds was the most since 1997.\n\nMany in Maine attribute the health of the fishery to conservative management, said Alex Todd, a scallop fisherman who also works the waters off Massachusetts.\n\n\"Up and down the coast, there have been good years recently compared to 10 or 15 years ago,\" he said.\n\nBut the scientists' findings track with others who have studied the impact of warming waters on shellfish, such as Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias. Beal, who was not involved in the study, has said rising seawater temperature could spell \"doom and gloom for the clamming industry and probably for other industries as well.\"\n\nThat's especially true of valuable species that are important food items, like clams and mussels, he said.\n\n\"None of this can be attributed to overfishing, a term that is used willy-nilly and applied erroneously to these declines in commercially important shellfish,\" Beal said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Allan Smith and Ali Vitali\n\nWithout offering evidence, Republicans continued defending claims that Democrats are trying to \"steal\" a pair of Florida seats as mandatory recounts in the Senate and gubernatorial races get underway.\n\nOn Election Day, Republican Rick Scott appeared poised to defeat Bill Nelson in the Senate race and Ron DeSantis would win the race for governor over Democrat Andrew Gillum. But as more votes have been counted in counties such as the Democratic-leaning Broward and Palm Beach, Scott and DeSantis' leads have narrowed to the point where, under Florida law, an automatic machine recount is triggered.\n\nAs of Sunday, Scott was up on Nelson by .15 percent and had a lead of about 13,000 votes. DeSantis, meanwhile, held a lead of .4 percent and was up roughly 30,000 votes.\n\nThe narrowing margin brought about allegations from Republicans such as President Trump and Scott that rampant fraud was taking place in Democratic-leaning counties. Scott and DeSantis have both declared victory. Nelson never conceded while Gillum walked back his concession on Saturday, calling for all the votes to be counted.\n\n\"Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida!\" Trump tweeted Saturday. \"We are watching closely!\"\n\n\"Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties,\" Scott said Thursday. \"We've all seen the incompetence and the irregularities in vote tabulations in Broward and Palm Beach for years. Well, here we go again. I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.\"\n\nState election monitors in Broward County told The Miami Herald on Saturday that they've seen no evidence of voter fraud. And Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, a Democrat, said he has seen no evidence of voter fraud in the county. In addition, the state agency tasked with overseeing elections said it is not investigating any claims of voter fraud.\n\nIn an interview with Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday, Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado \u2014 chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee \u2014 pointed to a pair of recent court decisions when asked if Democrats were trying to steal the elections from Republicans. Judges ruled that election officials in Palm Beach and Broward Counties had to turn over election information regarding how many people voted and how many votes were still left to count.\n\nTodd asked Gardner if he would \"accept those results\" should the recount lead to \"anything other than a Rick Scott victory\" and no evidence of voter fraud is found.\n\n\"Well, look, this is going to be done on the up and up because we're ensuring that,\" Gardner said. \"We've gone to court. We've won those court cases. We've proven that the violation, we've proven the violation of the Florida constitution.\"\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway was also pushed about the Republican claims that Democrats are seeking to \"steal\" the Florida elections. During an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week,\" Conway said the president did have evidence to back up that claim.\n\n\"Well, the evidence is that Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis have won,\" Conway said. \"In fact, Andrew Gillum conceded on the night of the election, now we\u2019re going backwards.\"\n\nBoth races, within the amount legally required to trigger an automatic recount, were too close for NBC News to call as of Sunday.\n\nDuring an interview with \"Fox News Sunday,\" Scott himself accused Nelson, the incumbent Democratic senator, being \"a sore loser\" when asked about the recount efforts.\n\n\"We've won,\" Scott said. \"I've had to win this election twice now.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer pushed back on Republican claims of Democratic trickery, telling CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" Sunday that Trump and Scott \"are so afraid of every vote being counted, because they think Scott will lose if that happens, that they're interfering.\"\n\n\"They allege massive fraud,\" he added. \"That's what Scott said. His own Republican officials in Florida said there is no fraud. When you vote by mail, it takes a while to count the ballots, because some of the mail votes come in on Election Day. And that's a process that should be transparent.\"\n\nThis weekend, Florida election officials began the machine recount, which they have until Thursday to complete, Lawsuits filed by both Scott and Nelson's camps, however, could complicate that timeline.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Scott filed new litigation in Palm Beach and Broward Counties requesting that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, until the recount is completed, impound and secure all machines, devices, and ballots when not in use. Scott also requested that votes counted after the noon Saturday deadline should not count.\n\nNelson fired back in a statement, saying that if Scott \"wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted, he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Tell the kids I love them. I'm not gonna make it home,'\" Jolly, 34, a surgical nurse at Adventist Health Feather River Hospital, told NBC News on Sunday.\n\nJolly, a mother of three, was in the process of evacuating the hospital in Paradise, California, on Thursday, when flames from the Camp Fire began swallowing trees in the parking lot. In recent days, the fire killed at least 23 in Northern California, as two wildfires continue to rage outside of Los Angeles to the south.\n\nStaff at Adventist Health Feather River Hospital arrived at work on Thursday morning unaware that flames were creeping toward the hospital, Jolly said. At approximately 7:30 a.m. PT (10:30 a.m. ET), the hospital was alerted that the Camp Fire was closing in. Moments later, flames jumped a canyon separating the hospital from the fire, and the medical staff were ordered to get patients out of the building and then flee themselves.\n\n\"We packed them in every vehicle possible,\" said Karen Davis, 67, a surgical nurse, who works at the hospital. \"Newborn babies and there's a lot of elderly in our community. One of the doctors that eventually escaped had to finish a surgery and get that patient out, too.\"\n\nNichole Jolly is shown in Chico, California on Nov. 9, 2018. Jolly evacuated Feather River Hospital in Paradise twice after she was driven back the first time when her vehicle, and her pants, caught fire in the Camp Fire. Don Thompson / AP\n\nJolly said it took about 20 minutes to clear the hospital out. She attributes the speedy evacuation to the hospital's emphasis on fire drills.\n\nOnce the patients were on their way, hospital staff, including Jolly and Davis, jumped in their respective cars and tried to flee, only to be met with gridlock traffic as the flames closed in.\n\nJolly was driving just behind Davis, when she was rear-ended and her car pushed into a ravine. The car was stuck and filling with dense, black smoke. Jolly was on the phone with her husband, who told her to run.\n\n\"Flames were right on the side of my car, and I thought, 'I'm going to die here or die trying,'\" she said.\n\nAt first, Jolly tried to get into Davis' vehicle, but the plastic handles on Davis' truck had melted. Jolly banged on the window, but heard no response and couldn't see through the thick smoke.\n\nThen, her pant leg caught on fire, forcing her to run to another car. When that car began to fill with smoke, Jolly decided her only remaining option was to run.\n\n\"I'm breathing in the hottest air I've ever been in. My throat is bloodied, I'm about to hit the ground but the bottom of my shoes were melting. I put hand out in front of me and prayed to God, 'Please, don\u2019t let me die like this,'\" Jolly said, adding that as she prayed, she reached a fire truck, where firefighters were able to extinguish her smoldering pant leg, before pulling her inside.\n\nJolly said the firetruck appeared to be melting, and the firefighters warned: \"Brace yourself. We might not make it.\"\n\nThe back of Adventist Health Feather River Hospital in Paradise, California, burns as it is overtaken by the Camp Fire.

My husband had to tell my kids he thought I wasn\u2019t going to come home,\" Jolly said as her voice caught in her throat. \"It was heartbreaking.\"\n\nShe said a bulldozer eventually pulled up beside the firetruck and cleared a path so the truck could return to Adventist Health Feather River Hospital.\n\nThere, hospital staff had set up a makeshift triage in a wide expanse of the parking lot, which would later be moved to a helicopter pad that had already been burned. Neighbors had begun arriving, some on foot, unable to evacuate and believing the hospital to be the only point of safety they'd be able to reach.\n\nDavis had already made it back to the hospital, after getting in a car with a case worker from the hospital. There, she and Jolly were reunited.\n\nA tree in the parking lot of Adventist Health Feather River Hospital in Paradise, California, is engulfed by flames as the Camp Fire creeps toward the hospital.

Eventually, firefighters told staff they could no longer stay at the hospital after its roof caught fire, and those remaining at the hospital were forced to try the now-empty roads again to get to safety.\n\n\"When we got everyone evacuated, Nichole and I got in a doctor's car, and we drove. ... It was thick smoke where we had to look at the stripe on the road to make it through, and there was a downed power line we had to drive over ... and then the air opened up,\" Davis said.\n\nDavis and Jolly later made it to Chico, California. Jolly was still there on Sunday, staying at a friend's home. Davis said she has since made it to Sacramento where she is staying with family.\n\n\"Nichole and I, we stuck together and people go, 'You're a hero,' but when we got back to hospital after losing our vehicles, we just kicked into that mode. It wasn\u2019t anything heroic, it was just, we have to do this we've got to do that,\" Davis said.\n\nBoth said they lost their homes and cars to the Camp Fire. They said a significant portion of the hospital was destroyed by the fire, too.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Shamard Charles, M.D.\n\nAs marijuana legalization builds momentum across the United States \u2014 with Michigan becoming the latest state to allow recreational use by adults \u2014 researchers are warning that more studies are needed on the long-term effects of chronic pot smoking on the human brain.\n\nMarijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States, but little is known about its effect on health or how addictive it is.\n\nAccording to a 2017 poll conducted by Marist College and Yahoo News, more than half of American adults have tried marijuana at least once in their lives, and nearly 55 million of them, or 22 percent, say they use it currently. Close to 35 million are what the survey calls \"regular users,\" people who say they use marijuana at least once or twice a month.\n\n\"Surprisingly, many people freely admit to using marijuana, but underreporting remains an issue,\" said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher and professor at Carnegie Mellon University. \"To correct for that one should fudge upwards by a factor of 20 to 40 percent.\"\n\nWith Michigan's Election Day ballot measure, 10 states and the District of Columbia now allow the drug's open use; 33 states plus D.C. allow medical use, leaving many to wonder if the U.S. will follow Canada's lead in legalizing marijuana nationwide.\n\nConsequences of chronic marijuana use\n\nNathaniel Warner, 31, a data analyst at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, first tried marijuana when he was 19, during his freshman year of college. Warner was having a hard time adjusting to campus life at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough transition for me and I was dealing with social anxiety,\u201d Warner told NBC News.\n\nNathaniel Warner, 31, from Rochester, Minnesota. Courtesy of Nathaniel Warner\n\nAt first he just smoked on school breaks, three or four times during the school year. \"But before I knew it, it was summer and I was smoking daily,\" he said. \"It just gave me a feeling I had never experienced before.\u201d\n\nAfter four years of heavy use, Warner noticed that his short-term memory was starting to fray. He avoided talking to people, and festering feelings of anxiety and depression grew. He tried to mask them with weed, deepening his dependency. In 2010 Warner upended his life, breaking up with his girlfriend and seeking recovery.\n\n\u201cI was hopeless. I realized that this lifestyle of being miserable and getting high was never going to change. I didn\u2019t want to go through a 30- to 40-year cycle of going to work and coming home and getting high. I didn\u2019t see an escape from that. That kind of shook me,\u201d Warner said.\n\nUnfortunately, Warner\u2019s story is not uncommon.\n\nWhile alcohol is more dangerous in terms of acute overdose risk, and also in terms of promoting violence and chronic organ failure, \"marijuana \u2014 at least as now used in the United States \u2014 creates higher rates of behavioral problems, including dependence, among all its users,\u201d said Caulkins.\n\nIs marijuana addictive?\n\nThe research leans towards yes.\n\nStudies have shown that chronic marijuana use affects the same brain structures that are involved with addiction.\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse suggests that 30 percent of those who use marijuana may have some degree of \u201cmarijuana use disorder.\u201d\n\nMarijuana use disorders are often associated with dependence \u2014 in which a person feels withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Frequent users report irritability, mood and sleep difficulties, decreased appetite, cravings, restlessness and physical discomfort that peak within the first week after quitting and last up to two weeks. Marijuana dependence occurs when the brain adapts to large amounts of the drug, requiring more and more to create the desired euphoric effect.\n\nMarijuana use disorder becomes addiction when the smoker cannot stop using the drug even though it interferes with many aspects of his or her life. Estimates of the number of people addicted to marijuana are controversial, in part because studies of substance use often use dependence as a measure of addiction even though it is possible to be dependent without being addicted.\n\nIn Warner's case, he developed both a dependence and an addiction. The first time he seriously decided to quit he gave his stash to his girlfriend to keep it away from him. Later that day, he came home and sweet-talked her into giving it back.\n\n\u201cEven though I was serious at the time about getting clean, I relapsed,\" he said. \"The thing about addiction is that you can wake up and be 100 percent convinced that you won\u2019t use again. You could take a lie detector test and you\u2019d pass with flying colors, but 12 hours later a trigger may cause you to change your mind and you might get high again.\u201d\n\nSigns of marijuana addiction\n\nInability to cut down or stop use\n\nUsing more than intended\n\nNot fulfilling daily responsibilities like going to school or work\n\nChoosing relationships and activities based on whether you will be able to get high.\n\nResearchers estimate that 4 million people in the United States met the criteria for marijuana use disorder in 2015, but only 138,000 of them voluntarily sought treatment.\n\nHow bad is chronic marijuana use?\n\nMost experts agree that more research needs to be done to accurately answer this question. First, there is no universal definition of what constitutes \"chronic\" use.\n\nA Canadian study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry in 2017 showed a substantial increase in \u201cpsychotic-like experiences\u201d in teenage users. The study also reported adverse effects on cognitive development and increased symptoms of depression.\n\nOther studies show that chronic use may even interfere with normal development of the adolescent brain.\n\nPatricia Conrad, professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal, believes that more research needs to be done to see the effects of chronic marijuana use on the brain.\n\n\u201cPotency has increased over time,\u201d said Conrad. \"More sophisticated technology is being used to extract CBD oil from the product, resulting in more and more products with potent levels,\u201d said Conrad.\n\nOne study that received a tremendous amount of publicity looked at 38,600 samples of cannabis confiscated from 1995 to 2014.\n\nAnalysis of these samples found that the average amount of THC, the psychoactive portion of the drug, rose from 4 percent in 1995 to over 12 percent in 2014. During that same time, cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive component of marijuana, fell from 0.28 percent to 0.15 percent. This shift in the ratio of THC to CBD has a pronounced effect on the drug's perceived potency.\n\nThe average potency of the flower product sold in Washington\u2019s state-licensed markets is over 20 percent, and the average potency of extract-based products \u2014 like oils for vaping pens, dabs and the like \u2014 is in the neighborhood of 70 percent, said Caulkins. He believes more research needs to be done to see how this difference in potency affects the body, compared with the weaker product studied in the past.\n\nAs more is learned about the the effects of marijuana on the brain and body, experts hope to figure out if marijuana is a drug that can be managed like alcohol or if it is a highly addictive drug that needs to be highly regulated, like tobacco.\n\nWarner has been sober since Oct. 17, 2010. He thanks his parents, the Mayo Clinic intensive addiction program and his 12-step recovery group for helping him to get back on track.\n\n\u201cAddiction is real. It's a slow downhill kind of thing \u2026 it takes some years to get to that low point, and years to slowly build yourself back up,\u201d said Warner. \u201cRecovery isn\u2019t easy, even for a guy like me who had resources, a support system, and no really bad consequences, like losing my job or going to jail.\u201d", "Get the Think newsletter.\n\nBy Gayle Tzemach Lemmon, adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author\n\nIt wasn't until I lived outside America that I understood what it meant to come from it. And just how special the \u201cright of the soil\u201d truly is. Today, as the phrase \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d gets tossed about often in the media and in Washington, it is worth remembering how central to our notion of our nationhood this concept has become.\n\nIn 2002, I lived in Berlin on a professional fellowship from the Robert Bosch Foundation. Germans I met used to ask me regularly where I was from and I always answered, \u201cAmerica,\u201d without really thinking about it. This did not satisfy my questioners, however. \u201cBut where are you really from?\u2019 they would ask, assessing my coloring, convinced I was really \u201cforeign\u201d to the United States, as they defined it. Over time, I learned where their questions headed: To be American, in their view, you had to look as if you had emerged from an episode of \u201cBaywatch.\u201d Your skin had to be pale, your hair blonde. I tried to explain that in the U.S. we didn\u2019t see it that way: Yes, I said, my father came from another country. But I was born American and was American. Period. \u201cIt\u2019s about a principle,\u201d I would try to explain.\n\nThis brought home to me, with blunt force, how fortunate I was to be from a country where you could be from any place and still belong.\n\nBut my explanations were almost always unsatisfactory. The concept was too unfamiliar. And this brought home to me, with blunt force, how fortunate I was to be from a country where you could be from any place and still belong. At home I had never had to contend with the question of \u201cwhere I was really from\u201d \u2014 which would have been Prince Georges County, Maryland, for the record.\n\nAt the time, Germany was different. There, then, you and your family could have lived in Germany for generations, speak only German and know only German culture, and still not be considered German. At the time I was working on a Wall Street Journal story on the German version of the H1-B visa for tech workers. Germany was working hard to get high-tech workers to come and contribute to its economy. Some of these tech workers came from India, and in the course of reporting the story I met several teens who were part of the Indian community in Berlin; they had grown up in Germany, but were still considered Indian because their parents did not have citizenship. These teens understood that they were not really considered German \u2014 one mistake and they would be labeled auslander (foreigner). I asked one young woman how she could be an auslander when German was her mother tongue. \u201cYou are an American, you won\u2019t understand,\u201d she answered. \u201cThat is how it is here.\u201d\n\nIndeed, I didn\u2019t understand. And I still don\u2019t. As Americans born to people born elsewhere, we do not remain \u201cforeigners\u201d but we immediately are part of the idea of the United States. The right of the soil is sacred. It withstands time, this idea that it is not about where you came from, but of what you are capable. Indeed, it is part of what has kept us safe: this refusal to otherize our newcomers, and instead to immediately bind them to us. One nation, indivisible. And, when we don't live up to our principles, we have paths to express ourselves. We can write or vote or speak out or organize to make change.\n\nI had never felt so strongly about the right of the soil and its role in making one nation until I saw the isolation and the sense of insecurity it conferred on young people who didn\u2019t enjoy its protections.\n\nI had never felt so strongly about the right of the soil and its role in making one nation until I saw the isolation and the sense of insecurity it conferred on young people who didn\u2019t enjoy its protections, who did not live under its umbrella. And I had never understood so strongly why the principles underpinning the U.S. Constitution and its 14th Amendment mattered. Young people who feel foreign, even when they have never known anything different, never fit in anywhere. They live in a citizenship purgatory, a nationality no man\u2019s land. As a result, they also don't feel invested in strengthening the national fabric because its blanket of protections and membership have never truly covered them.\n\nLove for one\u2019s country comes in different forms and is expressed in different ways. I have seen some of the most passionate expressions of patriotism from those who face the most danger at home. I have met Syrians who refused to leave their country even though it meant near-certain catastrophe as war neared. I have met Afghans who refused during the civil war and the Taliban regime to take refuge in Pakistan or Iran and who still remain in Afghanistan so that they can help to rebuild their nation. I met a doctor who treated women under the Taliban, at a time when most educated people \u2014 especially women \u2014 had fled abroad. When I asked her why she didn\u2019t leave like everyone else she knew, she said flatly and with no adornment, \u201cWhy would I leave? It is my country. As much as it is theirs. Maybe more. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nCitizenship and patriotism are connected. We feel fervently about the nations that embrace us.\n\nCitizenship and patriotism are connected. We feel fervently about the nations that embrace us. We merge our story with theirs. This allows us to feel part of a greater whole. The right of the soil allows us all to embrace the responsibilities and the rights that spring with the privilege of being defended and protected by the American Constitution.\n\nI cannot imagine growing up in a nation that told me I did not officially belong. To be a foreigner in my home. The right of the soil instills in the U.S. civic system a special kind of responsibility. And the ideas behind it strengthen our foundations and add to the \u201cwe\u201d that form the \u201cwe the people.\u201d I first learned what the right of the soil meant while in Europe.

They\u2019ve stopped in local police stations pleading for investigations. They\u2019ve arranged meetings with politicians and ambassadors to demand more protection for migrants.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was 12 years old when she left El Salvador for the United States,\u201d Yolanda Ram\u00edrez, who joined the caravan, said in Spanish. That was in 2007.\n\nRam\u00edrez, a single mother in El Salvador, said she had struggled with illness and was unable to provide for her children \u2014 so she couldn't say no when her daughter, Ana Mar\u00eda, wanted to leave to find a job in the U.S. \"She went to help me,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said. And then Ana Mar\u00eda disappeared.\n\nThe caravan is part of the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, a Mexico City-based nonprofit founded in 2004 by activist Marta S\u00e1nchez Soler, after she met Honduran mothers who had been searching for their children for years. They started the annual caravans in 2006 with 11 Honduran mothers, though Soler said mothers have been unofficially traveling together in search of their missing children long before then.\n\n\u201cWe look in parks, on trains, in camps, we post photos,\u201d says one mom whose migrant child has never been found after journeying north. \"We can't rest.\"\n\nActivists with the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement believe that in the past 10 years, tens of thousands of migrants from Central America have disappeared in Mexico while trying to make it to the United States, potentially victims of trafficking and drug and gang violence. The activists' estimate is based on the number of families that have contacted them for help, as well as their conversations with local police, shelters and churches.\n\n\u201cThis caravan is to remind authorities investigations are needed and to try and prevent this from continuing to happen,\u201d S\u00e1nchez Soler said Tuesday at a press conference in Mexico City.\n\nTo date, the organization has reunited 300 missing migrants with their families, S\u00e1nchez Soler said. The group pays fieldworkers to travel the route taken by migrants and ask about missing people at police stations, shelters and transit hubs. The organization receives private and university funding but does not get money from either the Mexican or U.S. government.\n\nFor Jim\u00e9nez, one of the hardest things about her son\u2019s disappearance is feeling helpless and not knowing if he is alive.\n\nMarcela Melchor, from Guatemala, holds a photo of her sister, Isabel Melchor Ramos (left photo), who has been missing for 10 years.

We can\u2019t rest.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, reports emerged that 100 members from the migrant caravan currently traversing Mexico had gone missing somewhere between the Mexican states of Veracruz and Puebla over the weekend. Local migrant advocates reported that the 100 migrants had boarded trucks on Saturday expecting to be taken to the next stop on their journey and hadn't been heard from since.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Mexico said in a press release Thursday that the U.N. had received information about missing migrants and was in touch with authorities in Puebla to investigate further. Police and prosecutors in Puebla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe members of the mothers caravan, glad that they were able to draw attention to their cause this week but discouraged by the news of the 100 missing migrants, will return to their home countries in Central America this weekend. But they said they won\u2019t stop fighting or searching.\n\n\u201cI know my sister-in-law is still alive,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Elsa Ram\u00edrez, from Nicaragua, in Spanish. Her sister-in-law, Lilian Ramos, went missing in June 2017. Ramos and her son were traveling to the U.S. with a coyote their family had hired. The last time Ramos' son saw his mother, she was being held back by the coyote on the side of the road in Mexico, as her son crossed into the United States alone.\n\n\u201cMy heart isn\u2019t broken,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said, \u201cbecause she is alive and one day we will find her.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Adam Reiss / NBC News\n\n\"Warhol upended traditional definitions of what constitutes art, incorporating his early professional experience with commercial design, changing the way we look at everyday items like a soup can or a soap box, brazenly embracing celebrity and incorporating political issues like AIDS and capital punishment,\" she told NBC News by email.\n\nPogrebin added that the new exhibit also gives a rare \"window into his early years, when he was just beginning to experiment with his form.\"\n\nWarhol started his career as a commercial illustrator, and his early works experimenting with stamps and stenciling are on display. He used those techniques to make art before he hit on subject matter that has mass appeal.\n\nWarhol, who died in 1987 at 58, became a successful and highly paid commercial illustrator in New York before he began to make art destined for galleries. He built a lucrative career and his clients included companies ranging from CBS and NBC to Ciba Pharmaceuticals and Martini and Rossi.\n\nHis work at his New York City studio, The Factory, was groundbreaking. Warhol was reinventing how we think about painting by using the silkscreen as a brush in his depictions of Marilyn Monroe, Marlon Brando and Elvis Presley.\n\n\"Modern art, as he defined it, meant everything was fair game as subject matter \u2014 from celebrities to soup cans to electric chairs,\" said Pogrebin.\n\nA self portrait of the artist Andy Warhol.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Phil McCausland\n\nShelley Roundtree departed the U.S. Army in 2013 after seeing friends and fellow soldiers die in combat during his tour in Afghanistan. He was committed to transitioning to civilian life, and one of his first steps was to enroll in college with tuition and housing benefits he'd earned under the GI Bill.\n\nRoundtree, 29, began studying marketing at Berkeley College in Midtown Manhattan. He dreams of working in the fashion industry, and he's close to graduating \u2014 but now there's a serious obstacle.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs is suffering from a series of information technology glitches that has caused GI Bill benefit payments covering education and housing to be delayed or \u2014 in the case of Roundtree \u2014 never be delivered.\n\n\"I\u2019m about to lose everything that I own and become homeless,\" Roundtree said. \"I don\u2019t want to be that veteran on the street begging for change because I haven\u2019t received what I was promised.\"\n\nWithout the GI Bill's housing stipend, Roundtree was kicked out of his apartment and is now living on his sister's couch, miles from school, where he feels like a burden on his family. The new living situation required him to move all his belongings into a storage container, which he can no longer afford. Now all of his possessions are in danger of being auctioned off by the storage facility.\n\n\"I\u2019m about to lose everything that I own and become homeless. I don\u2019t want to be that veteran on the street begging for change because I haven\u2019t received what I was promised.\"\n\nRoundtree said that because of his extremely strained finances, he is forced to choose between spending money on public transportation to get to his marketing classes or buying food \u2014 not both. At the end of the day, the veteran said he often makes himself go to sleep hungry.\n\n\"It\u2019s just confusing,\" said Roundtree. \"Who is there for us? Who is representing us? Who is helping us? Who is doing what they need to do to better the situation for veterans?\"\n\nThere are many veterans, like Roundtree, across the country who are still waiting for VA to catch up with a backlog created after President Donald Trump signed the Forever GI Bill in 2017. The landmark piece of legislation greatly expanded benefits for veterans and their families, but it did not upgrade the VA's technical capabilities to account for those changes.\n\nWhile it is unclear how many GI Bill recipients were affected by the delays, as of Nov. 8, more than 82,000 were still waiting for their housing payments with only weeks remaining in the school semester, according to the VA. Hundreds of thousands are believed to have been affected.\n\nThe cause of the difficulty lies within VA\u2019s Office of Information Technology, which was tasked with implementing a change in how the housing allowance was calculated, the agency said. The Forever GI Bill required that housing would be based on the ZIP code of where a veteran went to school, not where he or she lived.\n\nIssues that arose when VA attempted to stress-test their antiquated system, and a contract dispute over the new changes, meant VA waited until July 16 to tell schools to begin enrolling students, according to veteran advocacy groups. Many colleges and universities waited, however, because the VA told them that they would need to re-enter their student veterans' certifying information either way.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the floodgates opened,\u201d said Patrick Murray, the deputy director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. \u201cWith all the delays trying to get the upgrades in the ZIP code processing, they suddenly got all their enrollments, which usually come during the spring across the summer. Instead they all came a few weeks before the fall semester, and they couldn\u2019t keep up.\u201d\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie speaks during the National Veterans Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on Nov. 11, 2018. Cliff Owen / AP\n\nA VA spokesperson told NBC News by email that \"further system changes and modifications are being made and testing is ongoing on the IT solution\" to fix the delay in monthly stipend payments.\n\n\"These changes have led to processing issues,\" a VA spokesperson wrote, referring to the GI Bill changes, \"and VA is committed to providing a solution that is reliable, efficient and effective.\"\n\nAt the end of August, Veterans Benefits Administration had nearly 239,000 pending claims \u2014 100,000 more than at the same point in 2017. As school began, thousands of students faced dire circumstances and some faced eviction, getting kicked out of school or taking on loan or credit card debt.\n\nAs the problem appears to have no clear solution, the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs is holding a hearing Wednesday to investigate the matter.\n\nThe contractor hired by the VA to update its system for the Forever GI Bill, Booz Allen Hamilton, a multibillion-dollar information technology company, will be called to testify, a committee aide said. They will be joined by Under Secretary for Benefits Dr. Paul Lawrence and Director of the Education Service Robert Worley. A witness from the VA\u2019s Office of Information and Technology will also be called.\n\n\"This is \u2014 to be kind \u2014 a train wreck,\u201d said Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., the chairman of the veterans' affairs committee. \u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating the amount of money that Congress has appropriated for veterans, and this is the way VA has rolled it out. This discussion started over a year ago.\u201d\n\nWhile Committee staff never witnessed a \"blue screen of death,\" they did witness the system crash no fewer than five times in a ten minute period.\n\nRoe\u2019s office recently visited the VA\u2019s regional processing office in Muskogee, Oklahoma, along with Democratic and Senate Committee staffers and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.\n\nIn a Nov. 5 letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie, Roe said that employees at the processing center told the group that IT systems at the office froze and crashed so often that tasks that once took five minutes now required 45 minutes. Computers often suffered a \u201cblue screen of death,\u201d which required restarting machines, and \u201cmanagers had to write off 16,890 man hours due to system crashes or latency issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Committee staff never witnessed a \u2018blue screen of death,\u2019\u201d the letter said, \u201cthey did witness the system crash no fewer than five times in a 10 minute period.\u201d\n\nThe VA declined to share how much the IT system failures, overtime payments and the 202 additional workers hired to address these problems have cost taxpayers.\n\nAs some veteran advocates point out, this is not an issue that came as a surprise.\n\nAt the July 17, 2017, hearing in the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs \u2014 before the bill was passed into law \u2014 Deputy Under Secretary for Economic Opportunity Curtis Coy highlighted this as his core worry in response to one of the few questions asked during the hearing.\n\n\u201cMy biggest concern is two words: IT,\u201d said Coy at the time. \u201cWe have an IT system in much or almost all of these sections that requires some degree of changes.\u201d\n\nAfter Coy retired this year, the VA cut his position and the Office of Economic Opportunity. Multiple Veteran Service Organizations said the loss of this role, as well as the office, meant that there was no one left at the VA to communicate the issues to veterans or to lobby higher-ups about the GI Bill issues.\n\n\"People have been coming in and out of the VA like it\u2019s a revolving door, and this is another example where a lack of consistent leadership causes these problems.\"\n\nThat\u2019s not to mention the huge number of posts that remain unfilled at the agency. More than 45,000 jobs sit vacant at the VA, according to the agency\u2019s own numbers, and it has not had a permanent chief information officer since LaVerne Council departed the office after Trump\u2019s election.\n\n\"Right now Secretary Wilkie and Dr. Lawrence have only been on the jobs for months,\u201d Murray said. \u201cPeople have been coming in and out of the VA like it\u2019s a revolving door, and this is another example where a lack of consistent leadership causes these problems.\u201d\n\nBut veterans like Roundtree are less concerned about the leadership at the VA \u2014 they just want to know if they can depend on the money they earned under the GI Bill.\n\nAnd advocates are similarly concerned as it remains unclear if the VA will be able to catch up before January, or if it will be inundated with new requests next year and fall even further behind.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that there is an immediate fix, and I don\u2019t see how this is going to be addressed in the spring or summer semesters,\u201d said Tanya Ang, the policy and outreach director of Veterans Education Success. \u201cThis needs to be something that has a greater focus on it for a lot longer.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Joining me for insight and analysis are Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the Washington Free Beacon, former Maryland Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, New York Times columnist David Brooks and Eliana Johnson, national political reporter for Politico. Welcome to Sunday, it's Meet the Press.\n\nANNOUNCER: From NBC News in Washington, the longest running show in television history, this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nGood Sunday morning on this Veteran's Day. One hundred years to the day that mark the end of World War I. In the first few hours of election night it looked as if 2016 was repeating itself. Democratic House victories were a mere trickle in the first couple of hours. Republicans were winning big marquee races.\n\nAnd we wondered whether Democrats would have to wave their wave goodbye. But five days later the election looks a lot like what we expected. Nationally Democrats won 52% of the House vote to 46% for Republicans. And that 46% exactly matches President Trump's popular vote total in 2016. And, by the way, the president's job approval rating in our final NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on Sunday, 46% which is likely to be it looks like the number in the exit poll itself. Kudos to our pollsters. As of this hour NBC News projects that Democrats will win 231 seats in the House, plus or minus five. That means Democrats should end up netting somewhere between 35 and 40 seats when all the votes are counted. We have about ten or 11 races still uncalled.\n\nIn the Senate Republicans so have netted two seats. But Arizona and Florida are too close to call with Florida headed for a recount and, of course, there's that Mississippi runoff later this month. President Trump reacted with a combination of concern and confidence. Concern that House Democrats can now block his agenda, use their newfound subpoena power to investigate Russian election interference and perhaps look to see if he's profiting off the presidency.\n\nAnd then confidence that a Republican Senate will now have his back on those issues and approve his judicial appointments. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's signaled that he has no intention of slowing his assault on the Mueller investigation. Sacking immediately his Attorney General Jeff Sessions within hours after the polls closing and choosing as his acting AG Matt Whitaker who will oversee an investigation he's openly attacked. But it was the growing realization that Democrats had won a sizeable victory on Tuesday that seemed to have the president rattled.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nWhether they get a couple more House seats doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nPresident Trump acting emboldened but newly vulnerable is attacking the institutions which could hold him in check, claiming election fraud in Florida without any evidence.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nAnd all of a sudden they're finding votes out of nowhere. Although I hear-- I don't know you tell me.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAccusing Arizona of electoral corruption and even asking whether it is time to call for a new election. Mr. Trump banned a CNN correspondent from the White House while threatening to pull access from other reporters.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nIt could be others also. When you're in the White House this is a very sacred place to me.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nHe also threatened House Democrats who made their biggest gain since the post-Watergate elections of 1974. And will now wield subpoena power in investigations into his personal finances and contacts with Russia.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nThey can play that game but we can play it better because we have a thing called the United States Senate.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAnd he mocked Republicans who refused to embrace him.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nCarlos Cubela (SIC), Mike Kaufman, too bad, Mike. Mia Love gave me no love. And she lost.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nMost consequentially, less than 24 hours after polls closed Mr. Trump fired his attorney general, replacing Jeff Sessions with loyalist Matt Whitaker. Lashing out at reporters who asked if he wants his new acting attorney general to rein in Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nWhat a stupid question that is. What a stupid question.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThe president denied his relationship with Whitaker on Friday.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nI don't know Matt Whitaker.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nBut just a month ago--\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP:\n\nMatt Whitaker's a great guy. I know Matt Whitaker.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\n--as a political pundit on TV Whitaker has said Mr. Mueller's investigation could be turning into a witch-hunt and floated ways to weaken it.\n\nMATT WHITAKER:\n\nI see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller but he just reduces his budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\n\nREP. JERRY NADLER\n\nWell, Mr. Whitaker crosses the line the moment he accepts the job and doesn't recuse himself. We know he's not going to recuse himself because the only reason he was appointed was to sabotage the investigation.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nPresident Trump has continued to mold the Republican Party in his own image and earn the gratitude of newly elected Republican senators who ran like Trump.\n\nSEN. ELECT MARSHA BLACKBURN:\n\nI want to say a special thank you to the president.\n\nSEN. ELECT KEVIN CRAMER:\n\nA special tribute to our president.\n\nSEN. ELECT JOSH HAWLEY:\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nOn Friday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell made it clear he has no plans to bring a bill to protect Robert Mueller to the floor.\n\nSEN. MITCH MCCONNELL:\n\nIt's not necessary. The Mueller investigation's not under threat.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nJoining me now is Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California who will be the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee when the new Congress is sworn in January. Before we get to the political news, we want to note the three terrible wildfires that are taking place in your home state, Congressman. Last night the death toll rose to 25. Twenty-three of those deaths are in the Camp Fire, that's in Northern California, north of Sacramento. Two more fires are burning north of Los Angeles. Neither of the fires is now under control. Congressman Schiff, I know this is not -- it's next to your congressional district, but you and I were just talking, you said there's now some fires actually in your congressional district. What's the latest?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\nWell, obviously they're doing their best to try to control these fires. But this late in the fire season, to have this kind of devastation, it just takes your breath away. People are losing their lives, losing loved ones, losing their homes. And, you know, our thoughts are with them as well as these incredibly brave responders.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThe president tweeted the following yesterday, \"There's no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now or no more fed payments.\" Is that what this fire's about? Is it mismanagement of the forests in California?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\nNo, it's not. I mean, there are a lot of root causes about why the fire season has become so much worse over the years. But you know, for the president, at a time when people are facing utter disaster, to be making a statement like this, making a threat like this, this just goes to show how little he understands the job he has. That he would be punitive at a time like this, rather than coming to the defense of people facing the worst disaster of their lives. He's out there making these broad and false statements and threatening to remove funding from a state that's devastated right now.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDo you think it's a political thing because California's so blue?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\nI do. I do. This is a president who, more than any other, is punitive and I think we saw that in the tax cut by taking away state and local tax deductions. That was aimed at the blue states. Basically, he is only the president, I think in his view, of those who voted for him, the rest, he could care less.\n\nCHUCK TODD: I want to ask you about a letter that you guys are releasing this morning. And I say you guys meaning the leadership of the House, the Senate, key committee chairs, you're a signer of this letter, asking the Justice Department's ethics office to carefully review the current Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker's statements and comments and essentially trying to see if they are advising him to recuse and if so, are they going to inform Congress of that. What more can you tell me about this letter?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, it's signed by all of our leadership, House and Senate, myself included, to demand that we find out did they give an ethics opinion. Has one been sought on recusal? It seems to me the facts for recusal are very strong here. This is someone who's made repeated and prejudicial comments against the investigation. Someone who has made false statements about it, claiming that the Russians really had no impact on our election. It's someone who has a relationship with one of the important witnesses in the investigation. And I want to say this, if Mr. Whitaker does not recuse himself --\n\nCHUCK TODD: He's not legally required to even if the ethics office says he should, correct?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF: I don't know whether he's legally required to. But here's the thing, we have every right to expect all of the employees of the Justice Department to follow the ethics rules and that means especially the attorney general. But, you know, I want to make this very clear, if he doesn't recuse himself, if he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe we are going to find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe, whether he is serving as a back channel to the president or his lawyers about the probe, whether he's doing anything to interfere with the probe. Mr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer. And any role that he plays will be exposed to the public. We don't want there to be any ambiguity about that.\n\nCHUCK TODD: Are you convinced that he's constitutionally eligible to hold the position?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF: I'm not convinced at all. There are serious constitutional arguments that as a principal officer he cannot be appointed to this position. I think that's certainly the right policy answer. Also may be the answer demanded by the constitution.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nI'm curious what you thought of voter reaction to the Mueller probe. Our exit poll, we asked about their feelings in the Mueller investigation, 46% disapprove. That is a very familiar number to our viewers right now, 46% is the president's job rating, the number of the Republican vote. So I think we know what that core vote is. But only 41% approved of the Mueller investigation. Does political opinion -- how much should it impact what you do in the Democratic Congress these days?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\nWell, you know, political -- public opinion always affects us in one degree or another. But I will say this, having watched Mueller's ratings over time, the one thing that we see is around the time he produces indictments, around the time that he produces convictions the support for his investigation goes up. The longer the lapse between indictments the more his ratings go down. So what we're seeing now, I think, is merely the lull because in the period leading up to the midterms he properly took no action. But I think when he issues his report or if there are further indictments you will see public confidence in his work once again rise.\n\nCHUCK TODD: There is -- I know you probably want to get the House intelligence committee's investigation back on track after you\u2019re -- after the uneasy relationship between you and the -- who will be now the ranking member Devin Nunes. But I've heard a lot of investigations that Democrats want to do. You talked about in another interview that's going to air tonight about investigating the president's -- what was he doing with Amazon and the postal service. The incoming House judiciary committee chairman was caught on the Acela talking about how to investigate the Kavanaugh issue. Obviously the Mueller probe is going to be a part of this. How do you prioritize what to investigate? And, and at what point do you too much investigating?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, this is going to be very important, not just in terms of which investigations ought to go forward, which ought to go forward first, but also our strongest purpose here is to put forward a positive agenda and we don't want that lost in a flurry of investigations --\n\nCHUCK TODD: You are worried that there's so much talk about investigations that actually the idea of dealing with pre-existing conditions is getting lost?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we have to make sure it doesn't get lost. You know, that's really the first priority for us, it\u2019s the reason people voted to put us in the majority -- is to put forward a positive agenda. And, you know, let's face it, the investigations are sexy. They're interesting. You bring witnesses before the Klieg lights, people tune in. The legislative process is less so. It's much less dramatic. But nonetheless in terms of importance to the American people making sure that they can provide for their families, that they can get health care, they can keep their health care, that has to be priority number one. But we are going to need to ruthlessly prioritize on the intel committee which investigative threads we go down, but among the committees also, and we've already started that process.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nTwo quick questions, first of all, the Khashoggi tape that Erdogan has said, the Turkish president said that the United States now has a copy of it. You are part of that gang of eight. Is that true? And if so, have you heard it?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\nWe're going to get a briefing -- I'm going to get a briefing this week. So I fully expect to find out. I did have a briefing up until -- and got information up until recently. But I don't know the answer to that and I'm not sure if I did whether, I'd be able to share it with you anyway.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nFair enough. And I want to share with you, final number from our exit poll was the favorable rating of Nancy Pelosi: 31% favorable, 56% unfavorable. It looks like she has the votes for Speaker of the House. I know you are very supportive of her becoming Speaker of the House. What do you say to the new members, two of whom I'm going to have on here, who campaigned on new leadership, campaigned on a new generation of leadership, if the Democrats end up reelecting Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn as the face of the House Democratic leadership?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\nLook, we're going to have a lot of new people in the leadership. They may not be in the very top position or top positions, but we're going to have new leadership in the caucus. We've got a great breadth of talent that's coming up through the ranks. But I will say this, we're going into a fight likely with the president. I certainly hope that this president decides that it's in his naked, personal self-interest because that's the only thing that motivates him to work with Democrats on an infrastructure bill, on bringing down prescription drug prices. But if he decides it isn't, if he continues along this path where the only thing he wants to do is rile his base and --\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nRun against Nancy Pelosi.\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\n-- and run against Nancy Pelosi, we need the strongest general that we have. We need the best tactician, we need the best organizer.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAnd you believe that's her?\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\nAnd that's her. There's no one else honestly that comes close.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAdam Schiff, who will be the new chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, thanks for coming on, sharing your views. Good to see you, sir.\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF:\n\nGood to see you.\n\nCHUCK TODD:And joining me now from the other side of the aisle is Senator Cory Gardner. He is the man who is in charge or, I guess, still in charge of trying to get Republicans elected to the Senate. And I say still in charge because we have some outcomes that we don't know. Welcome to Meet the Press, sir.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Hey, thanks for having me, Chuck.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Let me just start quickly with the, the president's comments about the wildfires. Number one, I was curious of what you made of the appropriateness of the president threatening to deny federal help to California in the moment that people were fighting for their life.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, first of all, I think the Colorado thoughts and prayers of our state go out to California. We've been through this, certainly the catastrophes that we face each and every day we have a forest fire, what they're going through, it's just, it\u2019s tragic and terrible. And I don't think it's appropriate to threaten funding. That's not going to happen. Funding will be available. It always is available to our people wherever they are, whatever disaster they are facing. I do think, though, this year we came up with a strong bipartisan success in fixing the wildfire funding issue that had kind of paralyzed our ability to go out and fight fires and suppress fires and mitigate next year's forest fires. So one of the great bipartisan accomplishments of this past Congress was actually in the area of forest fires and finding a solution for funding.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Let me move to your job these days, which is at the NRSC. The Florida recounts. I want to play something that Governor Scott said on Thursday night when it was clear that we were headed into some form of a recount down in Florida. Here it is.\n\n[BEGIN TAPE]\n\nGOVERNOR RICK SCOTT:Every Floridian should be concerned there may be rampant fraud happening in Palm Beach and Broward Counties. We've all seen the incompetence and the irregularities in vote tabulations in Broward and Palm Beach for years. Well, here we go again. I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida.\n\n[END TAPE]\n\nCHUCK TODD: Do you have any evidence that fraud was committed? That somehow unethical liberals are down there are trying to change the vote in Broward County? Was that rhetoric -- was that an appropriate timing for that rhetoric? SEN. CORY GARDNER: Well, we have evidence that the state constitution of Florida was violated. A court in Florida has said that. We have evidence that people were going into unwitnessed areas filling out ballots, duplicating ballots, which is allowed under the law but only if you have witnesses on the canvassing board. We have, we have officials -- elections officials who are disobeying court orders, or at least were disobeying court orders. So I understand Governor Scott's frustration, that there are people who are breaking the law, violating the constitution in Florida in Broward County, in Palm. And so I think he's right to be upset. Now what we have to do though is make sure that we are protecting the integrity of this, of this election. That we count every vote, that we count every ballot, that we make sure the integrity of this election is as strong as it can be. And that we keep out those attempts by some to violate the constitution.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Do you believe --\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:And where we have those--\n\nCHUCK TODD:Yeah.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:\n\nGo ahead, Chuck, I\u2019m sorry. ((OVERTALK))\n\nCHUCK TODD:Do you believe Democrats, do you believe Democrats are actually trying to steal the election in Florida? Cause that's what the president has implied--\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, I believe --\n\nCHUCK TODD:-- in his tweets. And that seemed to be the implication of Governor Scott.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, let's look at the courts in Florida. You have a court in Florida that has said the, the constitution of Florida has been violated. You have several cases --\n\nCHUCK TODD:I understand that, but that, but that --\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:-- in Florida that are now going around that I feel strong about that.\n\nCHUCK TODD:That doesn't answer the question whether you think--\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, Chuck, you know there --\n\nCHUCK TODD:-- Democrats are trying to steal this.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, I think it, I think it answers it very much. Is this a Democrat that's doing this, that violated the constitution? Is this a Republican that's doing this that violated the constitution? I'm going to leave it to the courts to decide how we best protect the integrity of this election. But I think every person in Florida and around this country has a, has an interest and a right to a secure, integrity-filled election. And that if somebody is violating the constitution, that's got to stop. And that's what we're trying to do. Let's get the results the Florida people actually went to the ballot on. Let's make sure counties across Florida --\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nYeah.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:\n\n-- have the same standards, that a vote in Miami is treated the same as a vote in Pensacola. And if they're not, something is wrong with that process. So let's get this fixed, let's make sure this is right.\n\nCHUCK TODD: Yep.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:\n\nAnd let's make sure we are proud of the results going forward in Florida.\n\nCHUCK TODD:If a recount shows anything other than a Rick Scott victory, but there\u2019s no, you can't find any evidence of fraud or anything else, but the recount happens to show Bill Nelson winning, and it's done on the up and up, are you going to accept those results?\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, look, this is going to be done on the up and up because we're ensuring that. We've gone to court. We've won those court cases. We've proven that the violation, we've proven the violation of the Florida constitution. And I think that has shown the courts have worked. So I believe this will be a election that we can be proud of, an election that we were able to protect the voters in.\n\nCHUCK TODD:I want to ask you about the Arizona Senate race. That count is still coming in. The president has tweeted about it, sort of implying that somehow fraud could still be going on. Arizona obviously has a lot of, history of taking a while to count. And I want to ask you about this, \u201cTop officials at the White House and the Republican National Committee,\u201d this is in Politico, \u201cwho have been prodding the McSally campaign to amp up its efforts have expressed frustration that the Arizona congresswoman hasn't tried to drive a message that there's something amiss with the vote count.\u201d Do you believe there's something amiss with the vote count in Arizona or not?\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Yeah, we're still looking at hundreds of thousands of votes to be counted in Arizona. It's a little bit different than what we've seen in Florida whether it's incompetence or corruption, they're kind of the same side of the ledger. What we've seen in Arizona is a concern that every ballot, every county be treated equally in how they deal with elections and signatures. And I believe we've come to an agreement in Arizona where however they're treating a ballot in Maricopa of signature verification or otherwise is going to be the same way they're treating in Yuma or wherever else in Arizona. And that's important. Look, you can't have two different standards on determining what is a valid or legal vote. You can't do that. Because that's not fair. So I think we're on the right track in Arizona. We need to make sure that we do this. But there is no way, there is no way that an election official in Arizona should be allowed to treat their votes differently, more specially than any other area of the state.\n\nCHUCK TODD:There was a, a staffer of yours at the NRSC who was quoted as saying that an official in Maricopa County was, quote, unquote, \"trying to cook the books.\" It inspired this tweet from Mark Salter, the long-time chief of staff for the late Arizona Senator John McCain, nd he tweets this: \"Stop doing this, NRSC. McSally is losing fair and square and she's underperforming in more than Maricopa. The race is almost certainly lost and nothing will change that. All this does is poison our politics more. Despicable.\" What do you say to Mr. Salter?\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, I think we do have a chance to win in Florida, in Arizona. I do think there is a path. We've seen it in the numbers. But I do think it's important that we protect the people of Arizona. We can't sit by and allow votes to be counted in Maricopa that would not be counted somewhere --\n\nCHUCK TODD:I understand that.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:-- else.\n\nCHUCK TODD:But did you approve of--\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:That's not fair.\n\nCHUCK TODD:-- did you approve of your staffer saying things like cook the books? I mean it does, by throwing that language in there, as you know, it automatically polarizes the two sides. This minute language like that gets used.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Look, there's a lot of releases that are going to go out that I don't see or -- and I'm not familiar with this one. But what I do think is important and it's not the first time that somebody's been accused of cooking the books or rigging the outcome of an election. I think that's the last two years have been about by Democrats trying to go after President Trump on that as well. So what I think we have to do and what we've proven in the court in Arizona, or excuse me the agreements that we've come to in Arizona, is a way to treat voters equally across the state. We - look, this is about making sure that the votes are counted and the votes are counted fairly. And that's what I think we're getting to in Arizona finally.\n\nCHUCK TODD:Finally, last question, very quickly. The Mueller probe. Jeff Flake and Chris Coons said when they come back for the lame duck he's going to ask for unanimous consent to get this bill voted on. Do you think it's necessary? Do you think Mueller needs protection? Mitch McConnell does not. What say you, Cory Gardner?\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, I support the Mueller investigation. I know I've heard Senator McConnell say he supports the Mueller investigation. It's important for the American people. It's important that we have this for transparency. And I think it's important for the president to have this information out there fully, transparently, and accurately. The president has said he wants to keep this investigation moving forward and I believe that's the way--\n\nCHUCK TODD:Does it need protection legislatively, though? Do you need to do that in the Senate?\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:This election, this, Mueller is not going to be stopped. It's going to continue and it should continue.\n\nCHUCK TODD:All right, but you didn't say whether it was necessary in the Senate.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Well, I think it's going to continue. If it continues --\n\nCHUCK TODD:You don't need--SEN. CORY GARDNER:-- why protect something that's actually continuing?\n\nCHUCK TODD:Okay, I will leave it there. Senator Cory Gardner, Republican--\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Thank you.\n\nCHUCK TODD:-- from Colorado, thanks for coming on, sharing your views.\n\nSEN. CORY GARDNER:Thanks for having me. Thanks.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWhen we come back, is President Trump trying to derail the Mueller investigation by naming Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general? The panel is next.\n\nCHUCK TODD: Welcome back. Panel is here, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the Washington Free Beacon, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards of Maryland, Eliana Johnson national political reporter for Politico, and New York Times columnist David Brooks. Welcome. Happy Sunday after the midterms. David, I want to ask this, did the midterms change anything? Let me put up these numbers here. 46% was the president's popular vote total in 2016. 46% was the House vote for the Republicans in 2018. And 45% and then perhaps gets reweighted to 46% will be the president's job rating. I think I sense a pattern here. But I guess did the midterms change anything?\n\nDAVID BROOKS: I think they entrenched things. We've got like a big wall, a big barricade around that 46%. And that's Trump's base and they come out for him. And I don't see anybody leaving that wall or going into the wall. And so we're sort of stuck with the wall. This election, to me, was not a realigning election. It was just an entrenching election.\n\nCHUCK TODD: Interesting.\n\nDAVID BROOKS: But the things that leapt out at me is his people did show up. The surge in Republican turnout was not automatic and that tells me the working class is still hurting in this country despite the economy. And then the second thing I think you saw is I think the new Democrats, there's also a spin debate among the Democratic Party, was it the progressives who did really well or the new Democrats, the more moderates? And the more moderate ones have a very good story to tell this year that they flipped 23 red seats with sort of the people who were embraced by the moderate Democrats. So there is some moderation still in America. It's a lot of Republicans who used to be orthodox Republicans who are now moderate Democrats.\n\nCHUCK TODD: I want to put up something that Rich Lowry wrote. He wrote this, \"Midterm loss is typically humble as sitting president of the United States but Donald Trump is beyond humbling. It will be a high-stakes combat of the sort he thrives on, the more intense, perilous and dramatic the better because he will be at the center of it,\" Eliana.\n\nELIANA JOHNSON: You know I think we've we've seen from the president over the past two years, there were questions about whether he would become presidential in the job. And I think we've seen is he's a skilled communicator but he doesn't have a lot of range or ability to switch gears. So what we get from him is a number of meditations on American carnage, whether it's on immigration or post-midterms, Democrats stealing the vote in places where he lost. And that's what we're going to get for the two years from here until 2020. And as David mentioned, that does get the president's base out. But it doesn't expand the electorate. And now the question for Democrats is can they put up a candidate going forward that expands theirs and eats into some of the Obama/Trump voters who would turn out for the president and are proving extremely loyal to him and who he's very skilled at communicating with.\n\nCHUCK TODD: Donna, was this a referendum on the president?\n\nDONNA EDWARDS: Well, I think it was a rebuke of the president. And I think we began the week on election night with a modest but significant victory for Democrats. By the end of the week it had really crusted into a blue wave. And where I look at promises for the Democrats going forward is in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that were really significant victories in Southern Virginia. And that, to me, says where the Democrats need to place their eggs in the 2020 basket.\n\nCHUCK TODD: Matthew, what'd you make of the president? It did seem as if he moved faster on Jeff Sessions than even Jeff Sessions was prepared for to the point of Sessions made it clear, \"I was asked for this resignation,\" which is Washington speak for, \"You need to call it a firing.\"\n\nMATTHEW CONTINETTI: Well, we've seen this with Donald Trump since he descended down that escalator three years ago. When he's hit with a setback he immediately pivots and creates a new controversy where he may have a more solid ground. So have things changed? Of course they've changed. The Democrats are going to be in charge of the United States House of Representatives. That is a big deal. And so we've already seen with Chairman Schiff -- Chairman-designate Schiff that there will be investigations. The chance for conservative legislation, not that there was much passed this year anyway, but the chance going forward is greatly diminished. Was it a referendum on Trump? Yes. What we've seen again and again I think really since 1994 is that these midterm elections are referendums- referenda on the president. And typically the voters don't like what's happening. Whether that president's a Democrat or a Republican.\n\nCHUCK TODD: Matt Whitaker, David Brooks, what do we make of him? The arguments that he\u2019s even constitutionally- it's even a constitutional appointment.\n\nDAVID BROOKS: You know I think one of the- I went to 23 states this election and heard the word unraveling over and over again, that the country is unraveling. Are we racially together? Are we economically together? Are we morally together? And are our institutions together? And one of the things Donald Trump, the way he threatens our institutions, is he personalizes power. Where you don't serve the constitution, you serve Donald Trump. And so he wants people who will serve him. And that is not how the attorney general's office is supposed to act. It's supposed to serve the constitutions. So to me this is another threat to one of our institutions. And another one is the way we barked at the refs on the elections. And when you accuse somebody of corruption without any evidence you're destroying the social fabric to some degree. And we've seen a lot of that this week. So we're seeing institutional decay.\n\nCHUCK TODD: What do you make of that?\n\nDONNA EDWARDS: Yeah I mean you know- I agree with David. I mean I think that you know the president has gone after one institution after the other. And you see that in this call of corruption in these elections. Not to allow an election to be settled. And what I see is a president who really does feel that he's under threat. And so if you look at his response by both firing Sessions, appointing Whitaker who has you know made himself known to the president so that he could take advantage of that. And then you look at Democrat's response, I think it's going to be important to be really judicious about how they proceed.\n\nELIANA JOHNSON: You know the Whitaker appointment to me was reminiscent of the administration's policy on child separation where it was something that the president thought about and wanted to do, put in an acting attorney general who could sit there for 210 days and who was skeptical of the Mueller probe. And yet you see the president skeptical of it and backing away because he didn't anticipate the blowback that he would get from Democrats and Republicans alike. And it really I think revealed how even the best laid plans of this administration aren't so well-thought through. And that I think his statements hadn't been reviewed by the White House and tend to backfire. And then you have a president who abandons them very quickly.\n\nCHUCK TODD: What do you make of that?\n\nMATTHEW CONTINETTI: I think almost any attorney general who succeeds Sessions is probably going to have a critical view of the Mueller probe just because most Republicans now have a critical view of the Mueller probe. There were two sets of criticisms of Whitaker. One is kind of the formal criticism, is the appointment even constitutional. Those I think are pretty at least disputed and probably even weak. The more substantive criticism is is he qualified for the job. And then you just look at the resume, he's one of our lesser qualified attorney generals, if I can be charitable. So that I think is a problem for the president in that he has to come up with someone to replace Whitaker and emphasize the temporary on the temporary appointment.\n\nCHUCK TODD: It's very interesting. It seems like some of the candidates are pulling out because they'd like to wait to see what Mueller does. I don't think they want to be on the front lines. Chairman Schiff said, \"You're coming in front of Congress with whatever action you do.\" Anyway, we'll take a pause here. Up next, 2018 was, indeed, turned out to be the year of the woman. And when we come back two Democrats who helped make that goal a reality.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWelcome back. Well, move over 1992, 2018 is the real year of the woman. More than 100 women including incumbents were elected to the House on Tuesday. In fact, Democrats got the 23 seats they needed to win back the House with just women candidates alone. The New Yorker is marking this revolution at the ballot box with a cover called Welcome to Congress. Women going through the door of the old boys' club there. Two of the women who toppled incumbent Republicans and helped power the Democrats to victory in the House are with me this morning. Lauren Underwood, whose Illinois District is just outside of Chicago and Elissa Slotkin, who will represent a Michigan district that stretches from suburban Detroit to the state's capital, Lansing. Welcome to Meet the Press to both of you.\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nThank you so much.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nCongresswoman Elect Slotkin, let me start with you. Would you call your victory a referendum on the president?\n\nREP.-ELECT ELISSA SLOTKIN:\n\nNo. I, I think honestly we were able to amass support from Democrats, Republicans, Independents because the overall tenor and tone of politics, I think, is fundamentally unbecoming of the country. So the president, you know, leadership climate is set from the top so it's certainly a part of it. But it was an overall feeling like Washington was broken and that integrity had just been evaporated from the system. So it wasn't just the president. He was a part of it.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWhat about in your district? How much does the president matter in your district?\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nWell, the president is certainly a factor. But in the Illinois 14th district, we had not been well-represented. We had a congressman who was not carrying forward our voice, voted to take away health care, voted to raise our taxes, refused to act in the face of escalating gun violence in our country. And so in our district is very clearly about representation and did have what we deserved.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nIt's -- I'm sure hard to think about the fact that you have to immediately think about reelection. But let me ask you both this question, I'll start with you, Congresswoman Elect Underwood, what is the one accomplishment you have to have if you seek reelection two years from now?\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nWe have to protect health care for people with pre-existing conditions. It is the most critical issue in this election --\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nThat\u2019s the chief promise you believe you made?\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nHow do you think that's going to get done?\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nWell, it's going to get done immediately because we can protect the Affordable Care Act and we can fix it. We can stabilize premium prices, we can lower drug prices. But this idea that somehow people with pre-existing conditions might be vulnerable is something that I would never support.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nOther than health care -- I imagine preexisting conditions was huge in your district too. And frankly, it was sort of the number one advertised subject. Is there another accomplishment you have to have besides that you think in order to earn reelection?\n\nREP.-ELECT ELISSA SLOTKIN:\n\nYeah. We have to move on infrastructure and not just talk about it but actually put money behind it. In Michigan we need once in a generation investment in our infrastructure. Our roads but our water. I live 15 minutes from Flint, Michigan. We have a water issue going on in our state. So, we\u2019ve -- that's a place I think we have real bipartisan opportunity. People have talked the talk and now we need to walk the walk with real federal dollars.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nYou know what, neither one of you brought up investigations of the president. How are your constituents -- how do they view these potential wrongdoings by the president? How often did it come up? And how much do you think Congress should focus on this?\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nWell, protecting democracy is critically important. In article one of the constitution, the Congress is designed to a coequal branch of government. And so oversight is critically important. And in the 115th Congress, the Congressional Republicans essentially refused to do so. And so I think that there's certainly an interest to make sure that our critical pillars of democracy like free and fair elections can occur. But that it's not our primary and chief priority.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nYou heard Congressman Schiff. He admitted, yes, there's all these investigations and they can't cloud the big picture on substance. How concerned are you that it might?\n\nREP.-ELECT ELISSA SLOTKIN:\n\nI mean, we have to watch it. If we can't, as Democrats, as elected officials, provide for people and help their pocketbook or their kids, we do not deserve their vote. So we can walk and chew gum. Right? We can protect American values and hold accountability for the executive branch. But if we can't do things on health care and infrastructure, we just -- we're going to lose people. Especially in the Midwest.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nLet me talk about the leadership of your party. The RNC had a snarky release and you're both in it in different categories. The RNC put you, Congresswoman Elect Slotkin in the I promise to oppose Pelosi and/or support someone new caucus, and Congressman Elect Underwood, you were put in their category called the I'm going to avoid the question because of how deeply unpopular Pelosi is in my district caucus. Like I said, being a little snarky. I want to start with you, Congressman Elect Slotkin, is there any way under any circumstance you can imagine supporting Nancy Pelosi as leader of the Democratic Party?\n\nREP.-ELECT ELISSA SLOTKIN:\n\nI just think -- I never want to be disrespectful for anyone who has served, especially a woman who's broken glass ceilings. We just -- in my district, you need to hear what people are telling you. And they want, on both sides of the aisle, a new generation of leadership. So that's what I've said. That's what I'm sticking by. We have a long time now until we have to make this decision in Washington, in Washington hours and days. And so I'm going to wait to see who else emerges and make my decision.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nCongresswoman Elect Underwood, where are you on this?\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nWell, I believe that we have a real opportunity to support a speaker that's going to move forward an agenda, allow bills to come to the floor that would allow us to protect health care, to jumpstart our economy in Northern Illinois, to make sure that we can maintain some public schools, et cetera. I'm interested in supporting someone who is aligned on that type of an agenda. And I look forward to having conversations with whichever candidates end up running.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nYou're still open to supporting Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it sounds like.\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nWell, I'm looking forward to having a conversation with her and whoever else might end up being on the ballot for speaker.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAre you going to have -- how will you sell your constituents, Congresswoman Slotkin, if the top three, if it's Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn, if it's the same leadership as far as your constituents are concerned?\n\nREP.-ELECT ELISSA SLOTKIN:\n\nWell, we\u2019re going to -- I'm going to work with whoever is speaker. I'm going to work whoever is there. I mean, I've got to do right by my constituents and so we're going to work together. Amazing as it sounds, Americans can disagree and still respect each other and go on and do good work. So that's what we're going to do.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWho is the leader of the Democratic Party? If someone asked you that question right now, Congressman Elect Underwood?\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nThat's a good question. I, you know -- what's been really wonderful in this election is that each congressional candidate was able to set the tone and the agenda for their race.

I mean, honestly, I think the lesson of this election was that you got to run your race for your district. There is no mega message that's going to win things across the board. We have new energy in our party which is great. But it's diverse.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nElissa Slotkin, Michigan eight, new Democrat from there. Lauren Underwood, Illinois 14, new Democrat from there. Congratulations. Welcome, in the case of both of you, welcome back to Washington.\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN UNDERWOOD:\n\nThank you.\n\nREP.-ELECT ELISSA SLOTKIN:\n\nThanks, Chuck.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nComing on, we can debate whether or not Tuesday was a wave election. But there's no doubt there's been a national realignment. What that means for 2020 and beyond when we come back.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWelcome back, data download time. Following Tuesday's elections I feel more certain than ever that we are undergoing a massive realignment in American politics. Trends that we've seen over the past decade in urban areas, Democratic gains in cities and suburbs are starting to move south. The sun belt is the new battle ground. Let's start in Fort Worth, Texas, Tarrant County where Ted Cruz won by 16 points back in 2012. In 2016 Hillary Clinton was able to cut that Republican margin in half. Donald Trump only won Tarrant by eight. And this year the move to the left continued. Beto O'Rourke won Tarrant County by one point. Now this trend was already underway before President Trump came on the scene. But there's evidence that his toxicity in the suburbs has helped accelerate the trend. Let's move to Gwinnett County, Georgia. The suburbs of Atlanta. Republican Governor Nathan Deal won the county by 12 points in 2014. Hillary Clinton swung the county Democratic in '16. She won it by six. And this year Democrat Stacey Abrams extended that advantage winning the county by a whopping 14 points. Double digits. That county is blue. Not purple anymore. And, by the way, this was one of the counties in the Atlanta suburbs that once helped Newt Gingrich remake the Republican majority back in the '80s and '90s. Wow is it looking blue today. And of course there's Florida. In his 2014 race for governor Rick Scott won Seminole County, the northern suburbs of Orlando by seven points. In 2016 Donald Trump lost a little ground there. He only won the county by two. And this year Andrew Gillum flipped the county blue when he narrowly won it by two points himself. So despite all of this the GOP did tighten its grip on rural white areas which led to big state-wide victories across the country. Think Ohio, for instance. The politics seems to be finally catching up with geography in the sun belt. It's possible Republicans hung on to some of these urban/suburban areas for longer than they should have because back in 2014 and '16 Democrats weren't fully engaged in the sun belt. These numbers combined with big Democratic wins in suburban House seats show the Democrats growing power in these areas. The question is, is this the peak or is there more to come? Do these blue dots become blobs that expand? Stay tuned in 2020. We'll be back in a moment with end game. What Animal House has to do with this year's midterm elections.\n\nANNOUNCER:\n\nComing up, end game brought to you by Boeing, continuing our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire.\n\n(COMMERCIAL NOT TRANSCRIBED)\n\nANNOUNCER:\n\nEnd game brought to you by Boeing. Continuing our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nBack now with end game and time to channel some John Belushi from Animal House.\n\n(Begin Tape)\n\nJOHN BELUSHI:\n\nOver? Did you say over? Nothing is over until we decide it is.\n\n(End Tape)\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAll right. There are some races we haven't decided are over. In the Senate, Florida remains too close to call and is headed for a recount, possibly a manual recount with Republican Governor Rick Scott holding a narrow lead over incumbent Bill Nelson. A Scott win would be a Republican pickup there. Arizona is also a nail biter. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema's lead over Martha McSally has grown to nearly 30,000 with roughly 300,000 votes yet to be counted. That could end up being a Democratic pickup. And governor's races we're headed for yet another Florida recount. Republican Ron Desantis has a narrow lead over Andrew Gillum. And yesterday Andrew Gillum rescinded his concession. It's gonna go to a machine recount for now. We'll see if it falls into the threshold for hand recount. And in Georgia Republican Brian Kemp has a narrow lead over Stacey Abrams. That could go to a recount to see if it needs to go to a runoff. Finally, in the House as of this morning 11 races have yet to be called. The Democrat leads in six of those contests. The Republican in five. That's why our projection is plus or minus five at 231. Okay, let me start with Florida and Rick Scott and Bill Nelson already with a war of words. Take a listen.\n\n(Begin Tape)\n\nRICK SCOTT:\n\nIt's clear. We've got some left-wing activists. We've got some Democrat D.C. lawyers. They're down here for one purpose: to steal this election.\n\nBILL NELSON:\n\nClearly, Rick Scott is trying to stop all the votes from being counted. And he's impeding the Democratic process.\n\n(End Tape)\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nIs this the end of 2018 Elissa (sic) or the beginning of 2020?\n\nELIANA JOHNSON:\n\nYou know, there are a couple of races that are genuinely close. The Florida Senate race is one of them. The Arizona Senate race is another. But I do think that the candidates \u2013 other candidates like in the Florida governor's race where Gillum retracted his concession, I'm not sure if that's happened before. And the Georgia governor \u2013\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nWell, Al Gore famously did. But anyway, yes.\n\nELIANA JOHNSON:\n\n--and in the Georgia governor's race there\u2019s \u2013 these candidates are looking ahead and that they see digging in their heels in these races as a way to sort of amplify their celebrity. And popularize themselves with their base because I don't think the Democrats will be able to pull ahead. But they are ginning up enthusiasm with their base by refusing to concede.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDonna, how important is it that Democrats fight to the end on these?\n\nDONNA EDWARDS:\n\nI think it's really important. And let's look what Democrats are asking. They're asking for all the votes to be counted. Before you even get to a question of a recount or a runoff, count all the votes. And that's certainly the case in Georgia and definitely in Florida as well. And I look at these races are different because in Florida, I mean, in Georgia the question is can Stacey Abrams get to a point where there's a runoff then in the early December? That's a completely different question than what happens in recounts in Florida. This is really important because Democrats across the country want us to fight for every vote.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAll right, I want to do big picture here. We took the House vote. Let me show you the national House vote here, is 52-46. And we went ahead and extrapolated it out as if it were electoral map. And as you can see here's our \u201cWhat If\u201d map, David and Matthew here. And Democrats picked up four states if you believe the House vote there: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa. Florida, we put \u2013 if you give them to the Republicans Democrats would need a 284. What's interesting, David Brooks, is Democrats could get to 284 without both Florida and Ohio if those Midwestern states come back to them which the House vote indicated it might.\n\nDAVID BROOKS:\n\nYeah, and I talked about the entrenching. The Democratic entrenchment is just bigger now. And it seems to be permanently bigger. The question to me is do they have an agenda for the future? Running on pre-existing conditions, something that passed eight years ago, is not exactly a vision for the future. Do they have an affirmative vision for how a diverse country should work? How work should work? How moral integrity should be reintroduced? These are the big issues that are happening in countries all around the world. Democrats have been running on a very small set of issues, maybe excusable for the midterm, not going forward.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nHas the battleground shrunk or expanded? I mean it feels like Colorado, Nevada feel bluer today than they did yesterday. Ohio feels a little redder today than it did yesterday.\n\nMATTHEW CONTINETTI:\n\nAnd the election is two years away. I mean when you look back \u2013\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nTwo years.\n\nMATTHEW CONTINETTI:\n\n\u2013 when you look back and you see are midterms dispositive for the subsequent presidential? The answer is no. Do Republicans have work to do? Yes, because the terrain in terms of people has shifted. Independents, they narrowly backed Trump two years ago. Now, they're for Democrats big time. You look at the suburbs, again, Republicans competitive there two years ago. They are going toward the Democrats big time. White women, narrowly backed Trump two years ago, going to the Democrats this time. If Trump and the Republicans want to have the successful re-election in 2020 they need to get those groups back.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAny evidence that he knows how to appeal to those groups though?\n\nELIANA JOHNSON:\n\nI go back to my comment earlier which is that Trump has not shown that he has an ability to \u2013 he has no range as a politician or an ability to shift gears. And I think with him the single gear is what you get. And it may have worked in 2016. But I think it all depends on who the Democrats put up in 2020. Trump was very lucky in 2016. The Democrats put up a uniquely unlikable candidate. And 2016 was about who voters disliked more. We don't know if 2020 will be the same. It could. The Democratic primary will be very interesting. But if Trump will get lucky again, I'm not sure.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nDonna, what did you take away from the fact that the moderate centrist Democrats lost by bigger margins in places like Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota but the progressive Democrats got awfully close in places like Texas, Georgia and, of course, there's Florida.\n\nDONNA EDWARDS:\n\nWell, I mean they did. And I think what I take from that is that there is a strong Democratic message. I think we spend a lot of time around these tables in this last election saying Democrats didn't have a message. Turns out, they actually did, running in each one of these Congressional districts running to the districts. And I think that is going to \u2013 if Democrats do the right thing legislatively that is going to lead to success in 2020.\n\nCHUCK TODD:\n\nAll right, thank you very much. That's all we have for today. Thank you for watching. Perhaps you're watching at the 11th hour of the 11th day of this 11th month. Enjoy your Veteran's Day weekend. Be sure to thank a veteran if you know one or love one. And of course we'll be back next week.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Dante Chinni\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats may call Tuesday\u2019s election a wave, but look closer and you\u2019ll see the latest evidence of a longer-term shift in the suburban vote away from the Republican Party. This metropolitan realignment was so powerful this year that its impacts were felt in places that until now had largely been immune, namely southern states.\n\nDemocrat Beto O\u2019Rourke didn\u2019t unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in Texas and the party\u2019s gubernatorial nominees may not win in Georgia and Florida (votes are still being tallied in those states), but metro areas in each race showed a noteworthy suburban blue shift.\n\nThe movement in Texas was remarkable. Cruz won his race by some 27 percentage points in 2012, but on Tuesday the incumbent\u2019s margin of victory was less than 3 points \u2014 and the state\u2019s big metro areas drove the change. O\u2019Rourke flipped five big counties in state including Harris, the home of Houston, and reliably Republican Tarrant County.\n\nTarrant, the home of Fort Worth, sits next to Dallas and has long held a distinctive red cast in its voting habits, but that\u2019s starting to change. In his 2012 Senate campaign, Cruz carried the county by 16 percentage points. In 2016, the Republican edge narrowed, when Donald Trump carried it by only 8 points. On Tuesday, O\u2019Rourke flipped Tarrant and carried the county, narrowly, by less than a point.\n\nThat\u2019s a notable shift. The last time Tarrant voted for a Democratic Senate candidate was 1988, for Lloyd Bentsen.\n\nThe Georgia governor\u2019s race offers more evidence of the urban/suburban areas in the South turning blue. There, Democrat Stacey Abrams is behind Republican Brian Kemp by less than 2 percentage points with votes still being tallied. That\u2019s in a state where the Republican won the last gubernatorial election by about 8 points.\n\nHow did Abrams make the race so close? The counties in the Atlanta metro area were key, including Gwinnett.\n\nFour years ago, Gwinnett was a slam-dunk for Republican Nathan Deal when he carried the county by 12 points. Those numbers shifted markedly in the 2016 presidential race, when Gwinnett actually voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton by 6 points. (President Barack Obama had never carried it.) And on Tuesday night, Abrams blew open the Democratic advantage in the county, winning it by 14 points.\n\nAbrams won traditionally Republican suburban Cobb County as well. The swing in the Atlanta metro area is particularly noteworthy because these suburbs were the political base of Republican Newt Gingrich in the 1990s \u2014 the place he used to usher in a Republican majority in the House. That era seems to be sliding away here.\n\nA little further south, the gubernatorial race in Florida is, as one might expect, very close and seemingly headed for a recount. Currently, Republican Ron DeSantis leads by less than 1 percentage point. Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign has gotten support from some metro areas that have not been especially good for his party in the past, including Seminole County in suburban Orlando.\n\nBack in 2014, Gov. Rick Scott carried Seminole comfortably, by a little more than 7 percentage points. Donald Trump won the county in 2016 as well, but his edge narrowed to less than 2 points. This week Gillum captured Seminole by about 2 points.\n\nThat\u2019s quite an accomplishment for a Democrat. Obama did not carry Seminole even when he won the state of Florida by about 3 points in 2008.\n\nThe message in all these races is about politics and geography.\n\nThe changes that remade the Democrats as a metropolitan party in the north appear to be working their way down into the southern states as well. In fact, it may be that Republicans held onto these areas in the South in recent elections because Democratic voters weren\u2019t fully engaged. Turnout was very high in all these states on Tuesday.\n\nBut these numbers, combined with the Democrats\u2019 big wins in suburban House districts in this midterm suggest a massive urban/suburban realignment is remaking the American political map.\n\nThe real question in the numbers is have we reached the peak of that large-scale change, or is there still more still to come? Two years from now, the 2020 presidential election will offer some answers.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Allan Smith\n\nDemocratic leaders pressed the Department of Justice's top ethics official on Sunday to provide answers on whether the department has advised acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.\n\nIn a letter to Lee Lofthus, the assistant attorney general for administration, Democrats highlighted Whitaker's past comments criticizing the Mueller probe and what they called a \"troubling\" conflict of interest as evidence that he should have no role overseeing the investigation.\n\n\"There are serious ethical considerations that require Mr. Whitaker\u2019s immediate recusal from any involvement with the Special Counsel investigation of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,\" the Democrats wrote.\n\nBefore Whitaker joined the Justice Department as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' chief of staff in late 2017, he was a conservative legal commentator and wrote an opinion piece for CNN titled \"Mueller's investigation into Trump is going too far.\"\n\n\"It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else,\" wrote Whitaker, who has served as a U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Iowa from 2003 to 2009. \"That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\"\n\nAnd in a 2017 CNN interview, Whitaker defended Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., for taking a controversial June 2016 meeting with Russians at Trump Tower. In that meeting, Russians offered but did not ultimately provide dirt on 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"The official supervising the Special Counsel investigation must be \u2014 in both fact and appearance \u2014 independent and impartial,\" the Democrats wrote. \"Regrettably, Mr. Whitaker\u2019s statements indicate a clear bias against the investigation that would cause a reasonable person to question his impartiality. Allowing a vocal opponent of the investigation to oversee it will severely undermine public confidence in the Justice Department\u2019s work on this critically important matter.\"\n\nWhitaker, as highlighted by the Democrats, also served as chairman of former Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis' 2014 campaign to be Iowa state treasurer. Clovis supervised former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos in that role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last year to making false statements to the FBI as part of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials in any way.\n\n\"Mr. Whitaker\u2019s relationship with Mr. Clovis, who is a grand jury witness in the Special Counsel investigation, as well as Mr. Whitaker\u2019s other entanglements, raise additional concerns about his ability to supervise the investigation independently and impartially,\" the Democrats wrote, adding a request for Lofthus to provide in writing whether he or any other ethics officials at the Justice Department advised Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing the probe.\n\nSignatories on the letter included House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, ranking members Elijah Cummings, Jerold Nadler, and Adam Schiff of the House Oversight, Judiciary, and Intelligence Committees, as well as ranking members Dianne Feinstein and Mark Warner of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees.\n\nWhitaker's ascendance to the nation's top law enforcement position has been the subject of much controversy and scrutiny since President Donald Trump announced last week that he would replace Sessions, who said in a letter that he resigned from the post at Trump's request.\n\nSessions had recused himself from all matters related to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, which left oversight of the Mueller probe to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. But with Whitaker taking over the top post, at least temporarily, oversight of the investigation falls into his lap.\n\nThe acting attorney general has been reported as a close confidant to the White House, with The New York Times reporting in September that White House chief of staff John Kelly described Whitaker as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" at the Justice Department.\n\nAsked about his appointment of Whitaker, Trump deflected as to whether he knew Whitaker at all before he named him to the Justice Department's top job.\n\n\"Well, Matt Whitaker, I don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker,\" Trump told reporters Friday. \"Matt Whitaker worked for Jeff Sessions, and he was always extremely highly thought of, and still is, but I didn\u2019t know Matt Whitaker.\"\n\nIn an October interview with \u201cFox & Friends,\" Trump said: \"I can tell you Matt Whitaker\u2019s a great guy.\"\n\n\"I mean, I know Matt Whitaker,\" he added.\n\nWhitaker's appointment itself, regardless of any possible conflicts involving the Mueller probe, may not be constitutional, as Schumer and others such as attorney George Conway, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway's husband, have argued.\n\nAlberto Gonzales, who served as attorney general under former President George W. Bush, told CNN that Whitaker should \"absolutely\" recuse himself if the Justice Department ethics officials recommend he do so.\n\nAsked about the Democrats' letter to Lofthus on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday, Schiff said it seems to him that \"the facts for recusal are very strong here.\"\n\n\"This is someone who's made repeated and prejudicial comments against the investigation,\" he said.\n\nSchiff, who is slated to be elevated to chairman of the House Intelligence Committee once the Democratic majority is sworn in early next year, said that if Whitaker doesn't recuse himself from the probe and has \"any involvement whatsoever,\" Democrats will \"find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe.\"\n\n\"Mr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer,\" he added.", "Consequences of Midterms ripple through Congress, White House and Department of Justice copied!\n\nAs the final races are called in the 2018 Midterms, the consequences of the vote are reaching across Washington.\n\nRead More", "By Brooke Sopelsa\n\nThe U.S. has spoken out against Tanzania\u2019s moves to cut back on human rights and civil liberties, particularly arrests and harassment of LGBTQ people.\n\n\u201cThe United States government is deeply concerned over escalating attacks and legislative actions by the Government of Tanzania that violate civil liberties and human rights, creating an atmosphere of violence, intimidation, and discrimination,\u201d the U.S. Department of State said in a statement posted Friday.\n\n\"We are troubled by the continued arrests and harassment of marginalized persons, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and others who seek to exercise their rights to freedom of speech, association and assembly,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Tanzanian President John Magufuli in Kenya on Oct. 31, 2016.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., warned acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker that he should recuse himself from oversight over special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe amid concerns about his view of the investigation.\n\n\"If he doesn't recuse himself, if he has any involvement whatsoever in this Russia probe, we are going to find out whether he made commitments to the president about the probe, whether he is serving as a back channel to the president or his lawyers about the probe, whether he's doing anything to interfere with the probe,\" Schiff said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"Mr. Whitaker needs to understand that he will be called to answer, and any role that he plays will be exposed to the public. We don't want there to be any ambiguity about that.\"\n\nWhitaker's sudden ascension to the helm of the Justice Department has prompted criticism from Democrats who believe he could undermine the special counsel's investigation, as well as from legal experts who question whether Whitaker is constitutionally eligible to serve in the position.\n\nWhitaker, who served as former Attorney General Jeff Sessions's chief of staff until Sessions was ousted by President Donald Trump last Wednesday, is not expected to recuse himself from Mueller's investigation. That has raised concerns because of the new acting attorney general's past statements on the probe.\n\nWhile he was a CNN contributor in 2017, Whitaker mused about a new attorney general frustrating Mueller's investigation by reducing \"his budget to so low that his investigation grinds almost to a halt.\"\n\nAnd he's offered conflicting statements as to whether he believes there was Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nDuring a 2017 appearance on the Wilkow Majority Show on satellite radio, he said \"there was interference by the Russians into the election, but that was not collusion with the campaign.\u201d\n\nBut during an appearance on the Chosen Generation Radio Show earlier that year, he accused the \"left\" of \"trying to sow this theory that essentially Russians interfered with the U.S. election, which has been proven false.\"\n\n\"They did not have any impact in the election, and that has been very clear from the Obama administration,\" Whitaker said.\n\n\"They are trying to suggest that essentially the Trump campaign had these deep ties into Russia which is not true and I guess what they, that they are trying to conflate that somehow Russia and the Trump campaign sort of conspired to influence the election. It is crazy but at the same it has been dominating the news coverage.\"\n\nDuring his Sunday interview, Schiff said some of those comments raised concerns.\n\nTop House and Senate Democrats, including Schiff as the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, released a letter Sunday morning asking the Justice Department's top ethics official to disclose whether he believes Whitaker should recuse himself from overseeing the investigation.\n\n\"This is someone who's made repeated and prejudicial comments against the investigation, someone who has made false statements about it, claiming that the Russians really had no impact on our election,\" Schiff said Sunday.\n\nWhitaker's relationship with the Russia probe is just one part of an ever-growing list of potential Trump administration subjects Democrats are seeking to investigate. While Schiff admitted investigations are \"sexy,\" he said Democrats have to make sure their top priority in Congress is an agenda that goes beyond congressional probes of Trump.\n\nElissa Slotkin, the Democratic congresswoman-elect from Michigan's 8th Congressional District, agreed that Democrats have to \"watch it\" to be sure an anti-Trump agenda doesn't overtake their message.\n\n\"If we can't, as Democrats, as elected officials, provide for people and help their pocketbook or their kids, we do not deserve their vote,\" she said Sunday on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"We can walk and chew gum,\" she said. \"We can protect American values and hold accountability for the executive branch.

This election was about values.\n\nPresident Donald Trump deliberately defined the election as a showdown between liberal and conservative values: the New America (immigrants, minorities, young people, women) versus the Old America (whites, older men, religious people, rural Americans). The result? A standoff.\n\nDemocrats took charge of the House of Representatives while Republicans gained seats in the Senate.

The answer is that many of those whites have culturally conservative values driven by deep religious convictions. They vote their values over their interests.\n\nSo do a lot of educated upper-middle-class people. Take Jewish voters, who are disproportionately higher-income business and professional people. Their economic interests should lead them to vote Republican. So should the commitment many Jews feel to Israel. But look at how Jews voted on Tuesday: 79 percent Democratic, according to the NBC News exit poll. They put their liberal values over their conservative interests.\n\nThe wealthier you are, the more likely you are to vote Republican. That's interests. But the better educated you are, the more likely you are to vote Democratic. That's values.\n\nWhat happens to people who are both wealthy and well-educated? They are, to use a sociological term, \u201ccross-pressured.\u201d If they vote their economic interests, they vote Republican. If they vote their cultural values, they vote Democratic.\n\nThis midterm election was all about Trump, not the economy. Republicans did well in states where Trump was popular, like North Dakota (61 percent approval) and Tennessee (59 percent approval). Republicans did poorly in states where Trump was unpopular like New Jersey (40 percent approval) and Virginia (43 percent). The midterm vote was split in states where voters were closely divided over Trump, like Florida (51 percent approval) and, surprisingly, Texas (49 percent approval).\n\nTrump offends a lot of well-educated Americans. They regard him as vulgar, racist and a bully. As a result, Republicans are bleeding suburban voters who used to vote reliably Republican. They were the key to the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives.\n\nMore than half all Americans nationwide live in suburbs, and Republicans needed them to win. This year, however, suburban voters split their ballots between the two parties. Democrats picked up House seats in places like Orange County, California (Los Angeles suburbs), Fairfax County, Virginia (Washington suburbs) and Harris County, Texas (Houston suburbs).\n\nMeanwhile, the much discussed blue wave hit a red wall. Trump had held rallies in deeply red states, where his attacks on diversity, inclusion and political correctness resonated. He made no effort to appeal to swing voters.\n\nThe strategy worked in this year's Senate races, most of which were in red states like Indiana, North Dakota and Missouri. Democratic senators lost to Republicans in all three.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s strategy flopped in House races. House elections were held everywhere, and his red state rallies only alienated voters in affluent suburbs.\n\nIt's likely to fail again in 2020. In 2016, Trump pulled off surprise victories in historically blue states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Those states went heavily Democratic this year. All three elected Democratic senators and governors. Democrats gained six House seats in the three states.\n\nTrump\u2019s strategy flopped in House races. House elections were held everywhere, and his red state rallies only alienated voters in affluent suburbs. It's likely to fail again in 2020.\n\nDemocrats will face a tough choice in 2020. Do they want to nominate a \u201cDemocratic Trump\u201d \u2014 a candidate who can match Trump's aggressiveness blow for blow? Well, there's super-lawyer Michael Avenatti, who calls himself a \u201cstreet fighter.\u201d And former Attorney General Eric Holder, who is promising a more combative strategy. In response to Michelle Obama's advice \u2014 \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d \u2014 Holder said last month, \u201cWhen they go low, we kick them.\u201d That's what this new Democratic Party is all about.\n\nAlternatively, Democrats may want an \"un-Trump.\" Typically the party out of power wins by nominating a candidate who is very different from the incumbent. In 1976, after Watergate, we elected a Sunday school teacher who promised, \u201cI will never lie to you.\u201d Jimmy Carter was the \"un-Nixon.\" In 2008, Barack Obama was the \"un-Bush.\" In 2016, Trump was the \"un-Obama.\"\n\nThe candidate who thrilled Democrats this year by exhibiting civility, a very un-Trump-like quality, was Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke. O'Rourke's presidential prospects may have diminished because he didn't win. Trump would never stop calling O'Rourke a \u201closah.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are likely to have lots of choices for 2020. Every Democrat in Congress and every Democratic governor likely looks in the mirror each morning and asks, \u201cWhy not me?\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a lot of Democrats failed to show up at the polls. They didn't particularly like Hillary Clinton and they expected her to have an easy victory. She didn't need their vote. This year, Democrats showed up to vote in record numbers, just so they could hand Trump a setback.\n\nImagine what Democrats will do in 2020 \u2014 when Trump's name will actually be on the ballot.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy James Rainey\n\nImagine flooding a desert half the size of the Sahara. Using 238 trillion gallons of desalinated ocean water to do the job. Creating millions of 1-acre-square micro-reservoirs to grow enough algae to gobble up all of Earth\u2019s climate-changing carbon dioxide. For an encore: How about spreading the water and fertilizer (the dead algae) to grow a vast new forest of oxygen-producing trees?\n\nA Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Y Combinator, unveiled the radical desert flooding plan as one of four \u201cmoonshot\u201d scenarios that it hopes innovators will explore as potential remedies to catastrophic global warming.\n\nBut would it work? And should it even be tried?\n\nWith unlimited capital and political will \u2014 both far from given \u2014 experts said the scheme would stand a chance of reducing dangerous greenhouse gas levels. But while they generally believe the climate crisis has become severe enough to push even extreme options onto the table, the experts cautioned against interventions that might create as many problems as they solve.\n\n\u201cWe do not want to have this be purely profit driven,\u201d said Greg Rau, a University of California, Santa Cruz climate scientist and part of the team that helped Y Combinator craft the request for proposals. \u201cWe are trying to benefit the planet, not just make money. So we need this kind of research and development first, but then oversight and governance over how any of this is deployed.\u201d\n\nThe Y Combinator proposal grows out of what is now the consensus of climate scientists \u2014 that humanity needs to move beyond slowing the production of carbon dioxide and begin removing excess levels of the gas already straining Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe startup accelerator that helped finance Airbnb, Dropbox and Reddit asked innovators last month to come forward with specific proposals on desert flooding and three other extreme plans for reducing greenhouse gas concentrations. The existential threat posed by climate change requires research into solutions that the investment firm itself conceded could be \u201crisky, unproven, even unlikely to work.\u201d\n\nY Combinator said it had a rush of interest in its challenge. It declined to say how many took up the desert flooding option. But Sam Altman, Y Combinator's president, predicted that in 2019 his firm will fund three companies to pursue the \u201cPlan B\u201d climate solutions.\n\nA host of scientists who have studied Earth\u2019s ecosystems, climate change and bio-engineering said further exploration might be warranted. But they were quick to cite many reasons that desert flooding is not likely to succeed.\n\nMassive size\n\nY Combinator called filling 1.7 million acres of arid land with 2-meter-deep pools of water \u201cthe largest infrastructure project ever undertaken.\u201d Just to pump ocean water inland and desalinate it would require an electrical grid far greater than the one Earth now devotes to all other uses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a desert for a reason,\u201d said Lynn Fenstermaker, a research professor at Nevada\u2019s Desert Research Institute. \u201cFlooding the desert and then keeping the water there, in an already water-poor area with all the evaporation, is hard to imagine.\u201d\n\nY Combinator doesn\u2019t deny the magnitude of the challenge. \u201cEconomies of scale as well as breakthroughs in material science and construction technology will all be necessary for success,\u201d its proposal says.\n\nUnprecedented cost\n\nY Combinator pegs the price tag at $50 trillion. That\u2019s roughly half the entire globe\u2019s economic productivity for a year. Altman said in an interview that the cost for any solution will need to drop into the billions to become more realistic. \u201cYou can do a lot of things that require spending more money than you will ever be able to get,\u201d Altman said, \u201cand it just doesn\u2019t come.\u201d Brought to a more realistic price, he believes that governments will pay.\n\nDestruction of unique ecosystems\n\nMany species would be wiped out by massive man-made flooding of deserts. \u201cPeople think there is nothing valuable in the deserts, but that is far from the truth,\u201d said Henry Sun, a microbiologist and research professor at the Desert Research Center. \u201cThese diverse species deserve, and need, the desert to survive.\u201d Most of the world\u2019s countries would set a high bar, Sun said, before destroying habitat.\n\nPotential for making things worse\n\nInterfering with nature can have unexpected consequences. Katherine Mackey, a University of California, Irvine climate scientist, noted how Australia has long tried, and failed, to combat overpopulation of native species by introducing non-native creatures. Famous case in point: toads were introduced in 1935 to tame sugar cane-eating beetles. But the toads couldn\u2019t climb sugar cane. So the beetles thrived, alongside their new neighbors \u2014 an out-of-control toad population.\n\n\u201cSaying that we intervened and created a problem with global warming, so let\u2019s further intervene, that\u2019s not the thing to do,\u201d Mackey said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you fix the problem, by replacing it with another problem.\u201d\n\nDistracting from more workable solutions\n\nClimate scientists believe that most, if not all, the needed solutions for limiting new greenhouse gas emissions and reducing current CO2 concentrations already exist. Environmentalist Paul Hawken has catalogued solutions in his Project Drawdown. Taken in total, Hawken has said, they would reduce emissions and sequester enough carbon to more than meet the goals laid out by world leaders in the 2015 Paris climate accord.\n\nAmong the carbon-sinking projects that would require little or no new technology: creating new forests in degraded pasture, farm and other land; criss-crossing fields with trees to create so-called silvopastures, which absorb far more carbon than open fields; and preserving and restoring peatlands, the boggy wetlands that store carbon at twice the rate of the world\u2019s oceans.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s far easier to, for instance, make our houses better insulated and solar powered, than to flood deserts. Also, from a timescale perspective, how quickly will this technology be available at scale?\u201d said Mathis Wackernagel, president of the Global Footprint Network, an Oakland, California-based sustainability think tank. \u201cIf we want to solve climate, why not bet on the easy stuff?\u201d\n\nThe case for a moonshot\n\nAltman\u2019s answer is that he and Y Combinator already support, and fund, pragmatic green energy companies. But big reductions in greenhouses gases are still needed and don\u2019t appear to be coming quickly enough, the firm said.\n\nY Combinator suggests that flooding the deserts may be less risky than another solution on its list \u2014 fertilizing the oceans with massive amounts of iron or other nutrients to spur the growth of CO2-gobbling phytoplankton. Compared to ocean phytoplankton seeding, \u201cdoing so in desert reservoirs reduces systemic risk and exposure of the marine ecosystem to our widespread meddling,\u201d Y Combinator\u2019s request for proposals says.\n\n\u201cThe window for easy solutions is already closed. Doing nothing is guaranteed suicide,\u201d the firm said. Altman, 33, added: \u201cAll of this stuff is scary. However, runaway global warming where we all die is also quite scary. ...None of this is where we would like to be. But here we are.\u201d\n\nActivists and scientists interviewed by NBC News said exploration of far-out solutions is warranted \u2014 as long as researchers, governments and funders don\u2019t lose focus on other fixes.\n\n\u201cThe concern I have is that Silicon Valley seems very excited about these moonshots, when maybe what we need is a bunch of Boeing 737s,\u201d said Armond Cohen, executive director of the Clean Air Task Force, a clean energy think tank and lobbying organization. \u201cAnd to do it on a 10- to 15-year development cycle, not one that takes 30 years.\u201d", "In suburban South, Democrats break into Republican strongholds copied!\n\nMetropolitan realignment was so powerful this year that its impacts were felt in places that until now had largely been immune.\n\nRead More", "Incoming Congressional women: 'Just fine' that Democrats don't have a national leader copied!\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Meet the Press, Rep.-Elect Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) and Rep.-Elect Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) tell Chuck Todd that they don't believe Democrats have a national leader, but that might not be a problem.\n\nRead More", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Lee, Kristen Welker and Kelly O'Donnell\n\nPARIS \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a rebuke of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to international affairs at a ceremony on Sunday commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.\n\n\u201cNationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\u201d Macron said. \u201cBy saying, \u2018Our interests first, who cares about the others,\u2019 we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what gives it grace and what is essential: its moral values.\"\n\nMacron\u2019s remarks, which he delivered just steps from Trump and more than 80 other world leaders, come on the heels of the U.S. president proudly declaring himself a \u201cnationalist.\u201d\n\n\u201cA globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly not caring about our country so much, and you know what, we can't have that,\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in Houston on Oct. 22. \u201cI'm a nationalist. OK? I'm a nationalist. Nationalist. Use that word.\u201d\n\nAfter Macron finished his remarks, Trump appeared to grimace while offering muted and delayed applause.\n\nThe White House had no immediate reaction to Macron\u2019s ideological stand. Trump had his own platform to respond Sunday afternoon when he spoke at an American cemetery outside of Paris for fallen soldiers in both world wars, but he instead kept his remarks focused on those who died in the two conflicts.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump\u2019s speech \u201cwill focus on honoring the Americans who fought and died in World War One and our duty to remember the sacrifices of those that came before us.\u201d\n\nThe groundwork was laid for a clash of worldviews on the international stage this weekend even before Trump arrived in Paris on Friday night.\n\nAnd Macron\u2019s comments on Sunday were just the latest sign of tension in a relationship between the U.S. and French leaders that had previously been described as a bromance for its closeness.\n\nJust a day earlier Trump and Macron sought to publicly smooth over a disagreement about the French leader\u2019s push for a stronger European defense, which he said was necessary to protect the continent against not only Russia and China but also the U.S.\n\nThe pair described each other as close friends, and the U.S. president said the two are \u201cvery much similar in our views,\u201d but that moment of public camaraderie was short-lived.\n\nTrump had also decided to snub Macron\u2019s peace conference focused on international cooperation, which other world leaders gathered in Paris for Armistice Day will attend.\n\nThe ceremony on Sunday morning at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe was the centerpiece of the weekend, though the program began a bit behind schedule with none of the world leaders arriving in time to together mark the precise moment at 11 a.m. when the 1918 armistice was signed.\n\nTrump was scheduled to take his position on the platform last, but Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to steal that role. The Russian leader strolled up at 20 minutes past the hour, making for a notable entrance with all the leaders\u2019 eyes trained on him.\n\nBefore taking his place standing alongside Macron, Putin approached Trump for a brief handshake and flashed the president a thumbs up.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Steve Kornacki\n\nFor the second time in 18 years, a pivotal election may be slipping away from Democrats in Florida thanks to an unlikely culprit: the design of a ballot.\n\nThat possibility now looms over the Senate contest after machine recounts were ordered Saturday in that race, as well as the battle for governor.\n\nIf a recount leaves the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Bill Nelson, on the wrong side of the ledger, Democrats will be left to grapple with a major issue in what is supposed to be one of their most reliable vote-producing counties.\n\nBroward County, just north of Miami, is home to nearly 2 million people, making it one of the largest counties in America. For Democrats, it is also a vote-producing behemoth, typically accounting for more than 10 percent of all of the votes they receive statewide. Not surprisingly, based on the ballots counted from Broward so far, Nelson is crushing his Republican opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, 69 percent to 31 percent.\n\nBut that's where the ballot issue comes in. While there have been a lot of votes cast in Broward in the Senate race, there were more cast in the governor's race. As of Saturday, the gap stood at about 26,000.\n\nThis means that on about 26,000 ballots, voters registered their choice in the governor's race, which pitted Democrat Andrew Gillum against Republican Ron DeSantis, but not for Senate. That adds up to about 3.7 percent of all ballots cast in Broward. To put it mildly, that number is radically higher than anything found in any of Florida's 66 other counties, where votes cast in the Senate and gubernatorial races have tracked about evenly.\n\nClearly, something is up in Broward \u2014 but what? The Nelson campaign's attorney, Marc Elias, is suggesting that there is a machine issue that somehow resulted in votes from the Senate race not registering from some ballots. Broward's election supervisor, Brenda Snipes, meanwhile, is insisting there is no technical issue. If there is one, the recount will presumably catch it.\n\nBut the other possibility here is one that will evoke long-suppressed unpleasant memories for Democrats of a certain age: Did the design of Broward's ballot cause a small but critical chunk of voters to miss the Senate race?\n\nThere is some compelling evidence for this theory. A look at the Broward ballot shows that the Senate race occupies a lonely corner, buried in the left column under a lengthy set of instructions. The governor's race, meanwhile, is perched prominently atop the middle column, with wide spacing between the names of all six candidates who qualified to run. There's no question where the eye is more easily drawn.\n\nThen there is this: On the Broward ballot, the Senate race is paired in that lower left column with one other contest, for the House. Broward contains parts of four congressional districts \u2014 all of them safely Democratic \u2014 so voters in different parts of the county had different House races on their ballots. But in one of those districts, Rep. Frederica Wilson's 24th Congressional District, there was apparently no House race listed at all. That's because Wilson was running unopposed and Florida law mandates that the race simply not appear on the ballot in such a case, with the sole candidate simply being deemed the winner.\n\nProtesters demonstrate outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office on Nov. 10, 2018 in Lauderhill, Florida. Joe Skipper / Getty Images\n\nAnd, as political cartographer Matthew Isbell discovered, in the small portion of Broward County that is part of the 24th District, the number of ballots that contained no vote in the Senate race exploded. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, also examined results from precincts around the county and found that the number of non-votes in the Senate race was significantly higher than the statewide average everywhere \u2014 and particularly in the 24th District.\n\nThese findings strongly suggest that a small share of Broward voters simply missed the Senate race. The consequences could be enormous.\n\nIf most of those 26,000 had voted in the Senate race, and if they'd done so at the 69 to 31 percent rate for Nelson seen countywide, Nelson would have earned a plurality of about 8,000 from them. Scott is leading by about 12,000 votes as of this writing, but if the final statewide margin is trimmed to less than 8,000 votes after the recount, the Broward ballot could have ended up being the difference.\n\nThis is trauma that Democrats in Florida \u2014 and across the country \u2014 are only too familiar with.\n\nBack in 2000, when George W. Bush claimed the presidency with an official victory margin of 537 votes in Florida, it was the ballot of another giant and heavily Democratic county that helped to doom Democrats. Then, the culprit was Palm Beach County and its infamous \"butterfly ballot,\" which produced widespread confusion and a fateful anomaly, with Pat Buchanan receiving nearly four times as many votes in Palm Beach than in any other Florida county. Even Buchanan would later say that he believed the bulk of those 3,411 votes were intended for Al Gore.\n\nThere were, of course, other factors at play in Florida in 2000. Democrats maintain that a recount under a certain set of conditions would have given the state to Al Gore, while Republicans insist that the TV networks' early call of the state for Gore \u2014 when polls were still open in the strongly Republican Panhandle region \u2014 led dejected Bush voters to go home without casting ballots. It's impossible to pinpoint one factor that made all the difference.\n\nBut it's also impossible for Democrats to forget that Palm Beach ballot, just as this year's Broward ballot may end up etched into their memories forever.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Alex Seitz-Wald, Benjy Sarlin and Jonathan Allen\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The first rule of running for president is, do not talk about running for president \u2014 at least not until the last election is over.\n\n\"If anyone talks 2020, they should be disqualified, because our future is on the line,\" former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a potential Democratic presidential candidate himself, said on MSNBC a few days before last Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\nBut now, the 2020 omerta has finally lifted, setting off a rush of activity from presidential hopefuls as they try to get the jump on the competition by snapping up support from donors, party officials and freshly unemployed political operatives coming off midterm campaigns.\n\n\"I think this is going to hit people like a truck later this week,\" Robby Mook, who managed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and has informally advised a number of 2020 hopefuls, said just ahead of Election Day. \"Activists are going to be bewildered by how quickly they're going to be asked to make a choice.\"\n\nWith President Donald Trump already campaigning for re-election and a wide array of Democrats looking to challenge him, there may be little rest for the weary as the so-called invisible primary for 2020 gets underway in earnest.\n\nMost of the action will be on the Democratic side, where as many as two dozen potential candidates have been quietly \u2014 and in some cases not-so-quietly \u2014 preparing all year, campaigning publicly for midterm candidates in key states while privately courting crucial movers and shakers in the party.\n\n\"We've had in South Carolina in the past two months, close to 20 people,\" said Jaime Harrison, the former chairman of the Democratic Party in the crucial early primary state and a current Democratic National Committee associate chair. \"I don't even know if I can remember them all.\"\n\nBut South Carolina, along with other early-bird states like Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, is about to get even busier as ambitious governors, senators, congressmen, mayors and a billionaire or two look to find a corner in a crowded marketplace.\n\n\"At the end of the day with a big field, you have to figure out a way to differentiate yourself from other folks. And if you wait until it's the quote-end quote 'right time for you,' you might be on the outside looking in,\" said Harrison.\n\nTrump, 2020\n\nOn the Republican side, the starting gun went off long ago.\n\nTrump officially launched his 2020 campaign by filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Inauguration Day in 2017, and he's already raised a huge war chest of more than $100 million. He's also hired a small army of aides and advisers, including campaign manager Brad Parscale.\n\nThe president never really left the campaign trail, spending much of his first two years in office, and especially the latter part of 2018, barnstorming the country at trademark \"Make America Great Again\" rallies that served the dual purpose of supporting GOP candidates in the midterm elections and reactivating his personal connection with his base voters.\n\n\"People in my coalition are very happy, and they want more,\" said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and a close Trump ally.\n\nPolls have consistently shown that nearly nine in 10 Republicans approve of his job performance and the vast majority are satisfied with his record \u2014 tax cuts, a growing economy, more spending on defense and two new conservative Supreme Court justices are among the items on the president's re-election checklist \u2014 even if they don't all love his style.\n\nDissatisfaction within GOP ranks, particularly among educated suburban Republicans, could prompt a primary challenge, even if it's a long-shot bid.\n\nTrump will have to pay special attention to the three states that were key to his Electoral College victory in 2016: Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. In all three, Republicans lost Senate and gubernatorial races in the midterms.\n\nTrump campaigned in all three states in 2018 and yet two years into his presidency, with the economy in strong shape, voters in those states remain open to Democrats.\n\nThat portends a real fight for the president to either win back some suburban women or squeeze even more votes out of the rural strongholds that provided him big margins in 2016.\n\nOutgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of the Republicans who lost to Trump in the 2016 primaries, is often mentioned as a potential contender in 2020 \u2014 either as a Republican or as an independent \u2014 and he is due to visit the first primary state, New Hampshire, on Thursday.\n\n\"We're in the option-gathering business,\" said John Weaver, a veteran GOP strategist and longtime adviser to Kasich.\n\nRetiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a frequent Trump critic, also recently visited New Hampshire. And Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, another dissent Republican, has taken steps that could be seen as waters-testing, including writing two books critical of Trump's brass-knuckle style of politics.\n\nThe path to defeating an elected president in a primary, though, is a relatively unworn one. The only time it's ever happened was in 1856, when James Buchanan beat President Franklin Pierce for the Democratic Party's nomination.\n\nFor Dems, the question is when, not if\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, face a free-for-all for their nomination, with no prohibitive front-runners and an epidemic of \"why not me-ism?\" breaking out among the party's rising stars.\n\nOnly one candidate has formally declared \u2014 little-known Rep. John Delaney of Maryland \u2014 but virtually all of the other potential contenders who have been mentioned in the news media have taken clear signs to prepare for a run.\n\nAnd while no votes will be cast or caucus-goers tallied until Iowa kicks things off in February 2020, jockeying for position in 2019 will be just as important, since the party's delegate apportionment rules will likely winnow the field fast.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden may cast the biggest shadow, but while he leads in what few 2020 polls exist, he's unlikely to clear the field the way Hillary Clinton did in 2016.\n\nHe probably can't even count on support from all of his Obama administration colleagues, some of whom have expressed interest, like former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, former Attorney General Eric Holder and Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas, among others.\n\nBiden recently added three stops to promote his 2017 book, \"Promise Me, Dad,\" about the death of his son, including some in the backyards of other potential 2020 candidates, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\nSanders, the Democratic runner-up last time, may set the pace for the party's progressive wing and came off a recent campaign swing feeling energized by the large crowds that greeted him across the country, including in South Carolina and Iowa, according to people close to him.\n\nBut it's unclear if Sanders can get the band back together and reignite the spark of his 2016 insurgency without a foil like Hillary Clinton and with a number of fresher (and younger) faces for progressives to choose from \u2014 including several of his colleagues, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nFor these highest-profile potential candidates, whose every move is scrutinized and who would enter the race with high expectations, timing can be tricky, Mook said, drawing on his own experience lining Clinton up for her April 2015 entry into the race.\n\n\"The longer you're in, the longer in you can raise money, the longer you can build your social media assets,\" said Mook. \"But it\u2019s also the longer Donald Trump can taunt you and the longer you'll be vetted (by the press).\"\n\nBut for the rest of the potential field, who will hope to catch fire in the cornfields of Iowa and backwoods of New Hampshire, money may be the more immediate concern.\n\n\"For all these other candidates, the first question is: Where are you going to get the money?\" said David Brock, a prodigious fundraiser who speaks with donors often and runs a constellation of Democratic groups and super PACs. \"If you can't answer the question of where you're going to get the money, you're not going to go anywhere.\"\n\nIt's an ugly but real fact of American democracy: Running for president is expensive, and many a contender has sputtered out prematurely when they couldn't pay their staff or fly themselves around.\n\nSo it helps to be have connections to major donors, like McAuliffe, or be a proven online fundraising dynamo, like O'Rourke. And some candidates may bring their own money, which helps explain why so many billionaires \u2014 including Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2014 have had their names floated and been taken seriously.\n\n\"Part of it is self-fulfilling, because the more money you can get the more you can project an aura of viability, and money gets you more money,\" Brock said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Lisa Riordan Seville, Adiel Kaplan and Dan De Luce\n\nThe agents came for Issa Sao just before midnight.\n\nFor nearly five months, the 37-year-old had been moved from one detention center to another, hoping the United States would not send him back to a country that had jailed, tortured and expelled him.\n\nBehind him, in Ohio, lay his family \u2014 a wife, stepson and a young daughter who loved to smile big in photographs \u2014 and all 14 years of his life in the U.S. In front of him loomed Mauritania, a desert nation in West Africa that still tacitly permits the enslavement of black Mauritanians like Sao.\n\nLate on the night of Oct. 15, Sao's lawyer, Julie Nemecek, got his panicked call. \"His exact words were something like, 'Oh my God, they are taking us tonight! They are putting us on the charter!'\" she recalled. The next day, Sao was gone.\n\nIssa Sao with his daughter. Courtesy Sao family\n\nThe flight that took Sao back across the sea was part of an aggressive but little-noticed piece of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. The administration has redirected hundreds of millions of dollars and shifted diplomatic priorities in its effort to increase removals to countries, most in Africa and Asia, that have previously dragged their feet or refused to accept deportees the U.S. wants to send back.\n\nIt's an unprecedented push to deport a relatively small number of people.\n\nThere are an estimated fewer than 120,000 people with deportation orders from the 59 countries ICE has recently labeled \"uncooperative\" or \"at risk of non-compliance\" with deportations, according to an NBC News analysis of federal data from 2003 through 2017 kept by Syracuse University. That's about 1.5 percent of the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the country, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nSupporters of the effort say Trump's unbending approach has forced progress on an issue that had stymied agencies in the past, and is crucial to public safety. But critics assert that this pressure places deportations above diplomacy and could damage U.S. relationships with key allies, including Morocco and Iraq, partners in the fight against terrorism.\n\nFor the Mauritanians, advocates and Democratic lawmakers say it's a question of basic human rights.\n\nIn early November, Trump cut off trade benefits to Mauritania for its failure to combat forced labor and \"the scourge of hereditary slavery.\" Thousands of black Mauritanians like Sao live in slavery \u2014 a number that activists say is declining, but that the UN said could be up to 20 percent of the country's population less than a decade ago.\n\nYet since Trump took office, the U.S. has deported a record number of people to that very country. The 79 deportations last fiscal year mark a more than 900 percent increase over years prior, according to an NBC News analysis of ICE data.\n\nSao was among the first to be removed this fiscal year, which began October 1. ICE said 22 Mauritanians are currently in custody and could soon be returned.\n\n\"This isn't just about immigration,\" said Nemecek, Sao's attorney. \"It's our government handing people to their persecutors.\"\n\nIssa Sao with his stepson outside the White House in Washington, DC. Courtesy Sao family\n\nThe diplomatic challenge of uncooperative countries has been around for years. Prior administrations tended to view so-called \"recalcitrant\" countries \u2013 nations unwilling to accept deportees \u2014 as a relatively minor issue in the wider diplomatic landscape.\n\nBut not the Trump administration.\n\nIn his first week after taking office, Trump signed an executive order directed at enhancing public safety by cracking down on immigration. Tucked within it was a mandate to diplomats to make accepting deportees a priority in negotiations with foreign countries.\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, the number of people deported to countries on the list of recalcitrant nations more than doubled, from 970 to 2040.\n\nToward the end of the Obama administration, recalcitrant countries became a pet issue of congressional Republicans. Among them was then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, who served as Trump's attorney general until last week, and his former senior adviser Stephen Miller, who has shaped the president's hard line on immigration.\n\nUnder pressure from legislators, the Obama administration had increased the deportation of immigrants with criminal records and histories of violent crime. There had also been an uptick in deportations of immigrants like Sao, who'd been living in the U.S. without status for years despite orders of deportation.\n\nAmal Hana, of Warren, Mich., holds a photo of Donald Trump on June 16, 2017, outside the Patrick V. McNamara Federal Building during a protest in Detroit. Hana joined hundreds others to protest the recent ICE raids in which more than 100 Iraqi nationals in Metro Detroit were detained. Tanya Moutzalias / MLive.com via AP file\n\nWhen the Trump administration took office, Miller led an effort to zero in on deporting people from nations on ICE's list of recalcitrant countries, including failed asylum-seekers who had lived in the U.S. with deportation orders for years, two former and one current U.S. official told NBC News.\n\n\"[Miller] maintained that it was a law enforcement issue,\" said former U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Ted Osius. \"Some thought it was a racist policy, as it targeted African and Asian nations.\"\n\nIn closed-door negotiations and by levying a record number of visa sanctions, the Trump administration tried to force the deportations through.\n\nAs countries that had resisted accepting U.S. deportees for decades quietly began to acquiesce, ICE sweeps became more frequent. Some who were arrested had long criminal records and convictions for violent crimes. Many did not.\n\nImmigrants like Sao, who had no criminal record but had lost his bids for asylum, had always been near the back of the line for deportees. Suddenly, deportation loomed much more likely.\n\nA spokesman for ICE said that while it \"continues to prioritize threats to public safety, the agency will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement.\"\n\nWorking in conjunction with the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security has made \"tremendous progress,\" ICE officials told NBC News, adding that countries are obliged under international law to accept deportees.\n\nAs deportations picked up, the list of nations officially deemed \"recalcitrant\" by ICE shrank from 20 to nine.\n\n\"We consider all options at our disposal,\" a State Department spokesperson told NBC News, \"taking into account complex bilateral relationships, foreign policy priorities, and other extenuating circumstances.\"\n\n\"In many cases, diplomatic efforts are successful in addressing the problem,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nBut nations that don't cooperate are increasingly facing retribution. Since September 2017, DHS has imposed visa sanctions on six countries. Only two countries had ever been sanctioned before over deportations.\n\nThat hardline approach has proven effective, said Michele Thoren Bond, a former State Department official, who worked on the issue of recalcitrant countries under Obama.\n\n\"We are seeing real success, probably because countries believe they'll be sorry if they don't comply,\" said Bond.\n\nBut others argue this push to deport could put other diplomatic priorities at risk.\n\n\"The administration has not hesitated to bully smaller nations to force compliance with the new policy,\" said Osius. \"It has been extremely damaging in Laos and Cambodia, where relationships have sunk to new lows.\"\n\nMore strategically important countries are also in the administration's crosshairs. Morocco was considered recalcitrant when Trump came into office, and is one of more than a dozen nations that have since come off the list.\n\nFrom trade to help with counterterrorism and fighting violent extremism, the U.S. has long viewed Morocco as an important partner. Imposing visa sanctions could have jeopardized cooperation on an array of issues, experts said.\n\n\"If you want to do business in Africa, you can't have that conversation without Morocco,\" said one former diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a post-election press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington on Nov. 7, 2018. Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images\n\nLast summer, word of a shift at ICE started spreading through the tight-knit community of Mauritanians living in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nMost were asylum seekers from the desert country in northwestern Africa driven out in a bloody ethnic conflict that began in 1989, when the ruling minority of Arab Moors expelled some 70,000 non-Arabs.\n\nThe purge left thousands of black Mauritanians effectively stateless. Those who now return arrive without citizenship papers. Advocates told NBC News that leaves them vulnerable to enslavement, which despite being officially abolished in 1981, is still pervasive.\n\n\"I felt I was free.\"\n\nBut Mauritanians had long felt safe in the U.S. Even those like Sao who had lost asylum cases were allowed to remain because Mauritania didn't recognize them as citizens and refused to take them back. DHS had granted them work permits, set up regular check-ins and allowed them to stay.\n\nSavings from jobs on factory lines and at small businesses paid for down payments on houses. They married, settled down, had kids.\n\nAfter 26 years, limbo came to feel like permanence for Sy, who asked that his first name not be used. Like Sao, he had no criminal record, but had lost his asylum case and faced a standing order for deportation. Once a year, he checked in with ICE, then went at the agency's bidding to the Mauritanian embassy to request a passport so ICE could deport him. Each time, Mauritania turned him down. He went back to his daily life.\n\nHe sold clothes by day, drove Lyft by night and cared for his four children in between, including his disabled son.\n\n\"I felt I was free,\" he said.\n\nThen came the messages from friends in Columbus and Cincinnati. Mauritanians turned down for a passport just months before learned suddenly that ICE had obtained a temporary travel document \u2014 known as a laissez passer \u2014 that would allow them to be deported. But they still would not have any proof of citizenship when they landed in the country.\n\nAs men like Sao were arrested at ICE check-ins and boarded onto planes, Sy felt his own stability slipping away. He now checks in with ICE every three months. Each time, he tells his children if he doesn't return to them, it's because agents dragged him away.\n\n\"I ran away from the country 26 years ago. I ran away for my life,\" said Sy. \"Even now I'm still running.\"\n\nSene Sem and his daughter.

Somalis who fear returning to their war-torn country talk of fleeing to Canada. At least one Senegalese mother from Ohio already has.\n\nIt's not only the loss of lives built in the U.S. over decades, they said. It's also the risk of going somewhere they fled from that may still not be safe.\n\nSome, like Sene Sem, fled genocide as toddlers \u2014 or were born in refugee camps \u2014 and have no memory of the country the U.S. is pressing to take them back. Sem, who worked at a Rhode Island soap factory until ICE picked him up on Sept. 11, is fighting deportation to Cambodia. He was convicted of assault in 1990 and has a standing order of deportation.\n\n\"It would be devastating to us and to him,\" said Sem's wife Sarah Houey, who said her husband barely speaks Khmer, Cambodia's national language, and would be rootless. \"There's no family. There's no way he can survive there.\"\n\nSome of the Iraqis rounded up who were born in refugee camps have not been recognized by the country as citizens. A number are from the minority Chaldean community, Christians who do not speak Arabic in their homes and fear they would face religious persecution if returned.\n\nLast year, communities in Minnesota were shaken when the U.S. flew five charter flights carrying more than 500 Somalis back to their native country, a failed state that the State Department warns is riddled by \"crime, terrorism and piracy.\" A sixth flight carrying 98 Somalis last December only made it as far as Senegal. Detainees sat chained on the runway in Dakar for 23 hours before the plane few back with only muddled explanations from ICE about \"logistical problems.\"\n\nThe increasing pace of deportations comes with a hefty price tag for taxpayers.\n\nThis summer, to foot the bill for skyrocketing detention and removal costs, the Trump administration quietly funneled $202 million toward detention and removals from other budget lines within DHS, including FEMA.\n\nMore than half of the increase went to cover a nearly 30 percent overrun for transportations and removals. A key justification was the growing number of special charters ICE was running to once-recalcitrant countries, like the flight that took Issa Sao back to Mauritania last month. A single charter flight can cost more than $600,000, according to declaration from an ICE official from a lawsuit about deportations to Iraq.\n\nAstevana Shaya, 28, wears a Chaldeans Lives Matter T-shirt at a protest on June 12, 2017 in Sterling Heights, Michigan.

Six men they knew who had been deported were imprisoned upon their return to Mauritania. They didn't want Sao to be the seventh.\n\nA court turned Sao down on Oct. 15. That night, ICE took him away.\n\nAfter the scramble to confirm that Sao was in fact gone, Ohio waited. His family hoped he would call. Mauritanian activists kept an ear on the whisper network. The group of attorneys and advocates who had rallied around the community worried, including Lynn Tramonte, director of the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.\n\nThe day after the charter plane left an Arizona tarmac with Sao shackled aboard it, his wife got a call that he had landed in Mauritania, Tramonte said.

Political instability may force her into a quicker departure.\n\nOnce she is gone, experts say, populists will lose a useful arch-villain in their anti-establishment narrative. That could make it tougher for parties such as the AfD to craft a potent message for voters.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel Sean Gallup / Getty Images\n\n\"For all populists around Europe, Germany included, Merkel's departure will be seen as a major victory,\" said Josef Janning, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a London-based think tank. \"But the populists will find that, once she's gone, things are going to get a little more difficult.\"\n\nPopulism pits ordinary people against a self-interested political and intellectual elite.

She has also received significant criticism, even from some usually pro-immigration quarters, about her perceived mishandling of Germany's borders.\n\nIn direct opposition to Merkel, the AfD has been able to craft its anti-establishment message.\n\nWhen she steps aside, that movement \"will lose her as a 'target' for their specific way of political campaigning,\" Graef said. The populists \"will find it difficult to \u2018replace\u2019 her and will need to diversify their anti-establishment strategy, which is the core of their success.\"\n\nWhether Merkel's departure frustrates the AfD largely depends on who is chosen as her successor at the party's congress next month.\n\n\"The AfD has publicly acknowledged that their future success will depend on who will succeed Merkel, and what policy changes this may imply,\" Graef said.\n\nFor many observers, Merkel has already stolen a march on her rivals by jumping before she was pushed.\n\nMuch is uncertain about how, by staying on as chancellor, she might work with the new leader of her party while holding together the country's ruling coalition. Some argue that, by trying to stay until 2021, she at least has a chance to steward the transition into a new era.\n\nThree candidates for the CDU leadership have emerged so far.\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, 56, was chosen by Merkel as the party's general secretary earlier this year, and appears to be the chancellor's choice. Jens Spahn, 38, currently the health minister, represents the party's more conservative wing.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel meets with Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer in Berlin on July 2. Hannibal Hanschke / Reuters file\n\nFriedrich Merz, 62, is a rival of Merkel's who recently returned to politics and has described immigration as Germany's greatest challenge.\n\nEach candidate has strengths and weaknesses when it comes to countering the AfD.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer \u2014 or AKK as she's known \u2014 is an experienced political operator but could be tarred with the same brush as Merkel if she is cast too often as the chancellor's preferred heir.\n\nIf either Merz or Spahn take charge, they might steer the CDU to the right, occupying some of the AfD's political territory. However, an attempt by Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, to outflank the AfD on immigration spectacularly failed during October's state elections. There are also concerns that parroting AfD policy on immigration would amount to capitulation.\n\nThere are some tactics the AfD might deploy against Merkel's successor, according to Graef. These include focusing more on specific policy areas rather than personalities, or ramping up the message that the mainstream parties are too similar.\n\nBut whoever takes over, they are unlikely to be as synonymous as Merkel is with a pro-immigration policy that has so bitterly divided Europe's largest economy.\n\n\"On the one hand, Merkel is a symbol, especially regarding the refugee policy here in Germany,\" according to Stefan Wurster, a professor at the Bavarian School of Public Policy at Munich's Technical University.\n\n\"For the far-right, especially for the AfD, it becomes more difficult to hold this topic in the public arena and also to polarize opinion without the help of this specific person,\" he said. \"But of course, on the other hand, the question is, if Merkel is no longer in office, it depends who is coming next, and what policy the conservatives will have in the coming years.\"", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nBy Dan De Luce, Robert Windrem and Abigail Williams\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior officials in the Trump administration are convinced the Iranian regime is vulnerable to collapse and that tough U.S. economic sanctions could hasten its demise, foreign diplomats and former U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump himself has questioned if the regime can last.\n\n\"When I came in here, it was a question of when would they take over the Middle East,\" Trump said in an August interview with Bloomberg News. \"Now it's a question of will they survive. It's a big difference in one and a half years.\"\n\nBut European allies and intelligence experts disagree, and see Washington's forecast as a case of wishful thinking. While acknowledging the regime's growing economic and political troubles, European governments believe the Iranian leadership remains firmly entrenched and that any attempt to topple the government could produce a worse outcome, the diplomats said.\n\nIn meetings with foreign counterparts, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton and other officials have argued the regime is fragile and increasingly unable to manage a troubled economy and a frustrated population, according to nine foreign diplomats. They cite rising inflation, strikes and sporadic protests as telltale signs of a regime at risk, and that U.S. sanctions on its oil exports \u2014 which came into effect this week \u2014 could deal a crippling blow that will force Tehran to abandon its military adventures in the Middle East or even lose its grip on power.\n\n\"That's their logic,\" said one European diplomat, who disagrees and spoke on condition of anonymity. \"They are saying the regime is going to fall.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have also not detected signs that the Iranian regime is on the verge of unravelling, U.S. officials told NBC News. They see a regime that appears to be just as firmly in control as it has been for years. But they said they do see a country with mounting headaches, and think U.S. sanctions aimed at cutting oil revenues could cause real difficulties for the regime\n\n\"The Trump administration's policies appear designed to add to the political stress which already exists within Iran,\" a former U.S. intelligence official said.\n\nPompeo, Bolton and other top officials publicly insist the administration is not pursuing regime change, and that their policy is merely aimed at changing the regime's behavior.\n\n\"We certainly don't like this regime. It's a deeply hypocritical religious dictatorship that robs its people blind,\" a State Department official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told NBC News. \"Ultimately, it's up to the Iranian people to decide what government they want to live under. ...We want the Iranian people to be successful. We hope they can restore democracy there.\"\n\nBolton has a long track record of public statements calling for weakening the regime and ultimately replacing it. Eight months before he was named by Trump to his current job, Bolton gave the keynote address to the annual convention of the Peoples' Mujahedin of Iran, an anti-regime group known in the Iran as the MEK: \"I have said for the over 10 years that I've been coming to these events that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs' regime in Tehran.\"\n\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton, left, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attend a meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 11, 2018. Handrew Harrer / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIn language reminiscent of Cold War rhetoric, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has made a point of expressing solidarity with the Iranian people and appeared to invite them to oust the clerical leadership.\n\n\"In light of these protests and 40 years of regime tyranny, I have a message for the people of Iran: The United States hears you; the United States supports you; the United States is with you,\" Pompeo said in a July speech before an audience of Iranian-Americans in Los Angeles.\n\n\"And you should know that the United States is not afraid to spread our message on the airwaves and online inside of Iran either,\" said Pompeo, announcing plans to launch a 24-hour Farsi-language channel.\n\nThe administration has launched an aggressive information war against Iran on social media and a virtual embassy site, ridiculing Iranian leaders over corruption, air pollution, water shortages and the repression of dissidents.\n\nHawks close to the administration see many parallels between Iran and the former Soviet Union, and maintain that the current president could play a role similar to former President Ronald Reagan by taking a tough, uncompromising stance toward the regime in Tehran.\n\n\"We don't know that the regime is going to collapse. And we don't know when,\" said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which backed the administration's exit from the Iran nuclear deal. \"But we sense that this regime is a lot weaker than people believe, and that there's something rotten at the heart of the Islamic Republic in the same way that there was something rotten at the heart of the Soviet Union.\"\n\nThe Soviet analogy has sparked an internal debate among conservatives in Washington, with commentator and author Fred Kagan cautioning that the comparison is not precise and that the rulers of Iran could yet hold on to power for some time.\n\nIran's economy has come under serious strain over the past year, partly because of renewed U.S. sanctions and partly because of years of government mismanagement, experts say. The rial has plunged to record lows, losing 70 percent of its value. The IMF predicts the average inflation rate could surpass 34 percent next year, major European firms have pulled out and there are periodic shortages due to panic buying of staples. Teachers and truck drivers have staged strikes and thousands protested in cities across the country in December and January over rising prices and alleged government corruption.\n\nEuropean diplomats and experts say the protests and strikes are focused on specific grievances and have not evolved into a broader political movement.\n\n\"It would take a lot more than what's happening now to produce a collapse or regime change,\" said another European diplomat who asked not to be quoted by name.\n\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani has warned the country that U.S. sanctions will cause economic pain but vowed his government would resist the pressure.\n\n\"We are in a war situation,\" Rouhani said. \"We are in an economic war situation. We are confronting a bullying enemy. We have to stand to win.\"\n\nUnlike a previous pressure campaign led by the Obama administration between 2012-2015, the United States is leading a unilateral sanctions effort without political support from Europe and with Russia signaling it intends to throw Iran an economic lifeline.\n\nEven if Iran survives the latest squeeze by Washington, the Islamic republic appears to be descending into a long-term decline, said the former U.S. intelligence officer.\n\nThe Islamic republic's \"revolutionary energy has dissipated over the years,\" he said, and the country's youth are acutely aware of a more open, prosperous life elsewhere.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that the end is not necessarily near, in part because the Revolutionary Guard is well-placed to crush opposition and maintain the regime's hold.\n\n\"Although Iran appears increasingly fragile, it does not appear on the verge of a collapse,\" he said. The Revolutionary Guard \"appears to remain well-resourced, organizationally-cohesive, and its units are distributed around the country.\"\n\nAnother former intelligence officer, John McLaughlin, who served as deputy director and acting director of the CIA, said that the regime at the moment faces no organized, unified opposition.\n\n\"Major outbreaks against the government, in 2009 and before have been hampered by factionalism among the protesters and no unified leadership -- making it relatively easy for security forces to squelch opponents,\" McLaughlinsaid.\n\n\"I've seen no evidence that this has changed, so we should not hold our breaths waiting for the great successful uprising along the lines of what we saw in Eastern Europe 30 years ago.\"\n\nA vehicle burns as demonstrators protested high prices and the poor state of the economy in Dorud, in Iran's Lorestan province, on Dec. 30, 2017. SalamPix / Abaca/Sipa USA via AP\n\nGiven the absence of a viable opposition, destabilizing the regime could merely produce an even more aggressive government dominated by the well-armed and well-funded Revolutionary Guard, former officials and European diplomats said.\n\n\"They don't have a plan for what comes next,\" said one diplomat. \"It's very scary.\"\n\nIf the regime did unravel, it's unlikely it would produce a straight-forward transition to a more responsible or more representative government, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"There's just no precedent in the region's history or Iran's history that this all ends all quickly and neatly and to our advantage,\" Maloney said.", "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Twenty-six thousand died during just seven weeks of combat in 1918, when 1.2 million American troops, led by Gen. John J. Pershing, fought to advance on German positions.\n\nThe Meuse-Argonne offensive remains America's deadliest battle, and while it helped force the end of the war, its cost can be seen in the sweeping rows of gravestones at St Mihiel, which lies in northeast France, about 50 miles from the German border.\n\n\u201cThey are so important because you can\u2019t forget what these men and women did for us,\u201d said Jeff Hays, the cemetery\u2019s superintendent. \u201cIf these men and women didn\u2019t go and fight for us 100 years ago, where would we be now? What would our lives be like?\u201d\n\n'Losing ground'\n\nNov. 11 marks 100 years since Germany signed the armistice that brought the war to an end. More than 60 heads of state and government, including President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, are set to attend a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.\n\nThe Armistice Day commemorations are also the culmination of four years of events across the continent remembering the battles fought, the soldiers and civilians who fell and the establishment of a peace that turned out to be short-lived.\n\nTaking place at a time of international political instability, the Paris ceremony will be followed by the opening of the Paris Peace Forum, an international conference encouraging multilateralism that French President Emmanuel Macron hopes will become an annual event.\n\nNationalism and international self-interest mean that \u201cpeace is currently losing ground every day,\" Macron said as he announced the event.\n\nWhile \"the war to end all wars\" set the stage for an even wider conflict just a few years later, it also laid the foundations for international organizations such as the United Nations.\n\nIt's a lesson that historians are keen to keep alive, at a time when nationalist governments have taken power in Hungary and Poland, populist parties are on the rise across the continent and Britain is negotiating a messy departure from the European Union.\n\n\u201cToday, in an age of rising nationalism that ridicules these institutions for being \u2018global\u2019 in outlook, we need to remember that the worst-case alternative to international cooperation and multilateralism is the pursuit of national interests to the brink of armed conflict,\u201d said Catriona Pennell, associate professor of history at the University of Exeter in England.\n\nIn France, where many of the war\u2019s largest and deadliest battles were fought, it\u2019s hard to ignore the legacy \u2014 and scars \u2014 of the war, even after 100 years.\n\nAt the Aspasie vineyards in the north of the Champagne region, vintner R\u00e9mi Ariston found carvings in the attic of his family\u2019s farmhouse left by soldiers who used it as a temporary field hospital.\n\nR\u00e9mi Ariston holds a cigarette lighter he found in his family vineyard. He believes it belonged to a German soldier who fought in World War I. Carlo Angerer / NBC News\n\n\u201cIn some places, we found bombs that didn\u2019t explode,\u201d Ariston, 75, explained. While working the vineyards over the last few decades, he has often found other reminders, including a type of cigarette lighter he believes was handed out to German soldiers.\n\nDespite the hardships of World War I and the toll it took on his family\u2019s land, the Ariston family has produced champagne for five generations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to always keep in our minds that we arrive to do the peace, to keep the liberty, because the Americans came to help us,\u201d said Ariston\u2019s son, Paul-Vincent.\n\nA special connection\n\nIn nearby Fismes, memories of the war run deeper.\n\nThe front line ran through this town of 5,500, and a combination of fighting in the streets and heavy artillery destroyed 90 percent of its buildings. The arrival of American soldiers turned the fighting in favor of the French.\n\nSince the end of WWI, there has been a special connection with the American people, the town\u2019s mayor Jean-Pierre Pinon said.\n\n\u201cThere is a relationship from people to people, not just from government to government,\u201d he said.\n\nJean-Pierre Pinon, mayor of Fismes, said his town will forever be grateful for the service of American soldiers who liberated it at the end of World War I. Carlo Angerer / NBC News\n\nThat message of international understanding is reinforced by this month's centenary ceremonies, said Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the commander of the U.S. European Command and NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe.\n\n\u201cIt is through that same alliance with the French and our other allies that we persevered here in World War I, it\u2019s that same strong alliance that allowed the victory in World War II, and it\u2019s that same strong alliance today that is going to secure the future, that created over 70 years of peace here in Europe, and will continue to do so in the future,\u201d he told NBC News.\n\nTrump began his weekend in Paris by expressing how happy he was to be able to mark the centenary of the war's end.\n\nI am in Paris getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One.

But don't let her looks and demeanor fool you. She's also a Marine Corps major and grizzled combat veteran who's served in Afghanistan.\n\nDavie has learned to confidently navigate several male-dominated industries, including the U.S. Marine Corps and now comedy. The 33-year-old Arizona native is the supervising audience coordinator at \"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\" and performs stand up and sketch comedy on the side in New York City.\n\n\u201cPeople ask, \u2018Oh can women really be funny?\u2019 It\u2019s just like when people ask, \u2018Do women really have what it takes to be in the military?\u2019 And the answer is yes and the second part of that is it shouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d she told Know Your Value.\n\nDavie wants to shatter preconceived notions of women in the military. \u201cBeing in the military, it\u2019s not uncommon to hear that if you\u2019re a woman you either have to be a b---- or a slut or a lesbian\u2014and that\u2019s completely untrue.\u201d\n\nShe recently sat down with me to talk about her time in the Marines and the comedy world, and shared what she\u2019s learned from failure and battling gender stereotypes.\n\nOn her time in the military\n\nDavie joined the Marines in 2007 and is still serving as a reservist. She said women in the Marine Corps still deal with stereotypes, judgment and discrimination. After all, women make up just 8 percent of the exclusive armed services branch. \u201cWe're not exactly completely equal at this point,\" she said.\n\nBut Davie noted that women in the military have come a long way, from doing secretarial clerk work to having the first woman lead an infantry platoon. \u201cThe more women that we have joining the ranks, the better gender equality will be in the military,\u201d she said.\n\nDavie joined the Marines in 2007 and am still serving as a reservist. She was on active duty until 2011. Courtesy of Justine Davie.\n\nBeing in the Marines has influenced how she handles daily challenges. \u201cI have seen things happen that are completely out of my control. So it makes you freak out less if it\u2019s something like the printer is jammed, or someone is late. It\u2019s like, we can adjust. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really great about hiring veterans and working with people who have been in the military. They are resourceful, they can solve problems in a short amount of time and they can be really innovative in how they solve those problems.\u201d\n\nGaining confidence\n\nIt can be difficult to feel confident when you feel underrepresented. Besides being a woman, Davie is a first generation American \u2013 her parents immigrated from the Philippines when her father joined the U.S Air Force. \u201cI was surrounded by people who didn't look like me and I didn't have an example in the Marine Corps that I could look up to,\u201d she said.\n\nDavie\u2019s time in the Marines, however, taught her that women should embrace all opportunities. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be afraid to do the job that they want,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd part of growing your confidence, Davie said, is practicing your communication skills - whether it\u2019s in front of people, to a mirror, or recording yourself and playing it back. It helps you understand how you are being perceived.\n\nDavie is the supervising audience coordinator at The Daily Show and performs stand up and sketch comedy on the side in New York City. Sean Gallagher / Sean Gallagher\n\nDealing with sexual harassment\n\nThe effects of the #MeToo movement have also influenced the military, said Davie, noting she believes more women in the armed services are standing up for themselves.\n\n\u201cWe live in a culture where sometimes you think it\u2019s your fault and that\u2019s why bad things happen to you\u2014and it\u2019s not. And I think that kind of thinking is what needs to have a higher role in the way that we carry ourselves,\u201d she said.\n\nOwning Your Voice\n\nWhen it comes to standing your ground, Davie advised women, \u201cAt the end of the day, all you\u2019re ever going to have is yourself, so you need to take care of yourself. You need to stand up for yourself.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cThe other part of me wants to tell women that you have to surround yourself by good people, and you have to understand your own value. So you can\u2019t sacrifice those things just to be comfortable among your workplace or among this circle of friends. If you\u2019re not comfortable then there\u2019s a reason for that\u2014you have to trust your instincts.\u201d\n\nTransition into civilian life\n\nDavie urged women transitioning from active duty to seek support from friends and family and to not be afraid to ask for help. Trying to appear tough can backfire, Davie said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why we see people struggling long after they\u2019ve left active duty or come back from the war, because they can\u2019t compartmentalize anymore\u2014they have to address what they\u2019re actually going through, and they can\u2019t address it unless they really face up to it and just talk about it.\u201d\n\nKeeping her military friends close helped Davie adjust to civilian life. She urged other women in the armed forces to keep in touch with veteran communities. \u201cThose are the people that are going to understand what you went through no matter what generation they are,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI found a group of friends who, we were all in the Marine Corps, and we were interested in entertainment, arts, writing, filmmaking\u2014and we would just meet every week for brunch and just talk about ideas, and help get ideas into reality, and film things and write things together.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Dennis Romero\n\nThe leader of the union that represents a majority of California's firefighters said Saturday that President Donald Trump should apologize for blaming the state's deadly wildfires on \"poor\" forest management.\n\nThe Camp Fire in northern California reduced the town of Paradise to rubble and claimed the lives of 23 people, Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea said. In addition, two bodies were found Friday in the Malibu area, within the 75,000-acre Woolsey Fire zone, Los Angeles County sheriff's officials said.\n\n\"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\" Trump tweeted early Saturday.\n\nHe threatened to cut off federal funding for forest management, although it wasn't clear if he was speaking of the U.S. Forest Service or state agencies.\n\n\"The firefighters and the communities in this state deserve an apology,\" said Brian Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters union.\n\nTrump's criticism prompted a response from actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who tweeted, \"The reason these wildfires have worsened is because of climate change and a historic drought.\"\n\nActor Patricia Arquette tweeted, \"Maybe Trump would like to see what would happen if California threatened to withhold our federal taxes.\"\n\nJoe Piechowski evacuated Thursday night after the Woolsey Fire approached his home in Simi Valley. The lifelong Republican voter appeared upset as he spoke about Trump's tweet from his temporary home at an evacuation center in Thousand Oaks.\n\n\"This has nothing to do with forest mismanagement,\" he said. \"There is no forest on fire here in Southern California.\"\n\nThe Pasadena Firefighters Association declared the president \"wrong.\"\n\n\"The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management,\" the association tweeted.\n\nRice agreed. \"Malibu is not a logged area,\" he said. \"It\u2019s rolling hills and chaparral.\"\n\nWhat's more, he said, most of the state's forests are managed by the federal government.\n\n\"The president of the United States is ignorant of the process of forest management and wildfires,\" he said.\n\nJ. Keith Gilless, chair of the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection and a professor of forest economics at the University of California, Berkeley, said Trump \"is at best uninformed\" on the topic.\n\n\"California has always been a leader with respect to sound, science-based forest management practices on private land,\" he said in an email. \"Unfortunately, these practices don't have much influence on wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, or drought cycles, even if they may help us to address the long-term threat of climate change.\"\n\nThe president has proposed cuts to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for two consecutive years, including a 15 percent reduction in funding for 2019. The department oversees the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nThe state of California keeps a rainy day fund for disasters such as flooding, earthquakes and fires.\n\n\"They plan for it very well,\" Rice said, singling out California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) for being on top of the state's wildfires.\n\nA Cal Fire spokesman declined to comment, referring questions to the governor's office.\n\nGov.-elect Gavin Newsom tweeted, \"Lives have been lost. Entire towns have been burned to the ground. Cars abandoned on the side of the road. People are being forced to flee their homes. This is not a time for partisanship. This is a time for coordinating relief and response and lifting those in need up.\"\n\nNewsom announced on Friday that Trump and the Federal Emergency Management Agency had granted a request for a Presidential Emergency Declaration and federal funds to help battle the Camp and Woolsey fires.\n\nIn Butte County, where the Camp Fire has charred 105,000 acres, Rice said he watched Saturday as a firefighter gave an evacuee his own extra pants and shirt to wear.\n\n\"This entire community is wiped out,\" he said. \"You would think the president of the United States could get a little close to that.\"\n\nMaybe Trump heard him. Later in the day, Trump tweeted, \"Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic. God Bless them all.\"\n\nEarly on Sunday, however, the president seemed to return to his earlier theme. \"With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California,\" he tweeted. \"Get Smart!\"", "Royal Family attends London's Festival of Remembrance copied!\n\nThe Royal family attended this year's Festival of Remembrance held at Royal Albert Hall in London, marking 100 years since the end of World War One.
