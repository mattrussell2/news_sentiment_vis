["The charge also marks the second time Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp has lodged major allegations of hacking without evidence. | John Amis/AP Photo Elections Georgia\u2019s Kemp lobs evidence-free hacking allegation at Democrats on eve of vote\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp announced Sunday that he opened an investigation into the state Democratic party, accusing it without evidence of attempting to hack the state's voter registration system.\n\nThe allegation came two days before Kemp, a Republican, squares off against Democrat Stacey Abrams for governor in a race that's a dead heat according to polls.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe charge also marks the second time Kemp has lodged major allegations of hacking without evidence. In 2016, Kemp accused the Obama administration's Department of Homeland Security of trying to hack the state's voter registration, charges the DHS inspector general concluded were untrue.\n\nSunday's announcement arrived shortly after attorneys suing Kemp on behalf of Georgia voters notified his office of a voter registration system vulnerability that they say could render millions unable to vote, said one of the lawyers, David Cross. Rather than address the problem, Cross said, Kemp made bogus allegations that quickly generated headlines about Democrats and \"hacking.\"\n\n\"Everyone's focused on the wrong thing and doing exactly what Kemp wants,\" Cross told POLITICO. \"He was worried the vulnerability was going to come to light and he wanted to get ahead of it and have the story focused on something else.\"\n\nKemp's office stuck to its version of events, however.\n\n\"While we cannot comment on the specifics of the ongoing investigation, I can confirm the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes,\" said Candice Broce, Kemp's press secretary. \"We can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.\"\n\nThe office said a failed hacking attempt led to the investigation, which began Saturday. The probe comes after Democratic officials and voting rights advocates informed the FBI of an apparent glitch in the voter registration site that could be exposing voters' information.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment to POLITICO.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Georgia castigated Kemp's move as a political stunt that underscores his poor track record on cybersecurity issues.\n\n\"This is yet another example of abuse of power by an unethical secretary of state,\" said Rebecca DeHart, executive director for the Democratic Party of Georgia. \"To be very clear, Brian Kemp's scurrilous claims are 100 percent false, and this so-called investigation was unknown to the Democratic Party of Georgia until a campaign operative in Kemp's official office released a statement this morning.\"\n\nAbrams, who said on CNN Sunday morning that she learned about the investigation on air, responded that Kemp was \"desperate to turn the conversation away from his failures.\"\n\nDuring his term as secretary of state, Kemp has proven to be a controversial figure and was often criticized for his stance on election security in the state.\n\nBesides the debunked allegations against DHS, he has fought election integrity advocates and voters in court who have tried to force him to replace the state's electronic voting machines with more secure versions, and who have faulted his office for a leak that exposed the personal information of millions of voters. Georgia is one of only five states that rely solely on electronic voting machines that do not have an auditable paper trail.\n\nAdditionally, Kemp has come under fire for purging of voter rolls of more than 1 million voters. The fact that he's administering his own election as secretary of state recently inspired former President Jimmy Carter, a former Georgia governor, to call for Kemp to step down from his current job.\n\nKemp's office said it notified federal agencies about the investigation. \u201cThe State of Georgia has notified us of this issue,\" a DHS official said. \"We defer to the state for further details.\u201d\n\nCross said the vulnerability came to light when a Georgia voter noticed the state's My Voter page didn't seek verification of his identity while he was seeking his own voter registration information. That meant that anyone could access voters' personal data through the vulnerability and alter it.\n\nThe resident sought out one of Cross' clients, and the attorneys spoke to the voter Friday afternoon, Cross said.\n\nThe attorneys then notified the FBI and Kemp's outside counsel on Saturday, Cross said, and gave them the voter's information. Meanwhile, the resident also contacted the Democratic party as another avenue of addressing it, Cross said.\n\nThe vulnerability remains, Cross said.\n\n\"Nothing has been done,\" he said. \"Nobody has contacted the Georgia resident. We tried to keep it out of the press because we don't want the vulnerabilities to be known the world.\"\n\nBut Kemp's office portrayed the affair as an attempt to breach the My Voter system.\n\n\"We opened an investigation into the Democratic Party of Georgia after receiving information from our legal team about failed efforts to breach the online voter registration system and My Voter Page,\" the office said later Sunday. \"We are working with our private sector vendors and investigators to review data logs. We have contacted our federal partners and formally requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate these possible cyber crimes.\"\n\nEric Geller contributed reporting to this article.", "In March 2017, a little-known Democratic congressman named Beto O\u2019Rourke proposed something unusual to Will Hurd, a Republican colleague from a neighboring district: that they rent a car and embark on a 24-hour, 1,600-mile road trip from San Antonio to Washington. Their live-streamed odyssey wound up attracting blushing news coverage and evoking the bipartisan companionship of a bygone era. For Hurd, a pragmatic, swing-district moderate with numerous Democrats employed on his staff, the cross-aisle kumbaya was routine; few lawmakers hug the middle so tightly. For O\u2019Rourke, the demonstration was less likely; he had done little to distinguish himself in the House of Representatives, and what reputation he owned was not that of a centrist. He won his congressional seat in 2012 by running to the left of an incumbent Democrat\u2014a moderate Hispanic who warned voters of the El Paso councilman\u2019s ultra-progressive policies\u2014and spent the ensuing years compiling a safely liberal voting record.\n\nTwo weeks later, however, the strategic rationale behind the bipartisan road trip was manifest. \u201cRegardless of party or background or geography or any other difference that someone might want to highlight, we all have this in common,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate. \u201cWe\u2019re Americans. We\u2019re Texans. We want what\u2019s good for this state. We want what\u2019s good for this country.\u201d In running against Ted Cruz, a name and a political brand synonymous with brutal partisanship, O\u2019Rourke would represent the antidote: comity instead of chaos, agreeability instead of animosity, decorum instead of demolition.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn selling a symbolic candidacy, the Hurd roadshow was foundationally essential. But it wasn\u2019t enough. To score the biggest upset of 2018, O\u2019Rourke would need a brand that reinforced his rejection of status quo politics. So he created one\u2014a campaign that rejects corporate money, that avoids negative attacks, that refuses to employ pollsters or consultants. And it worked. By offering a cause rather than a candidacy, O\u2019Rourke convinced America that a Texas Democrat could win statewide for the first time since 1994. A staggering $70 million flooded into his campaign. Celebrities came calling on a first-name basis. LeBron James made the black-and-white \u201cBeto\u201d signage famous. National reporters took turns deifying the skateboarding, punk-rocking congressman. And all the while, O\u2019Rourke was flatlining. When Quinnipiac polled the race in April, after he clinched the Democratic nomination, he registered at 44 percent; in July, the same poll pegged him at 43 percent; it was 45 percent in September; and 46 percent in late October. Whenever the race has tightened, it\u2019s due to Cruz dropping below 50 percent. In dozens of public and private surveys this cycle, O\u2019Rourke has never broken 47 percent.\n\nO'Rourke greets supporters near a polling place on the first day of early voting on October 22, 2018 in Houston, Texas. | Loren Elliott/Getty Images\n\nSomewhere along the line, the rock-concert crowds and record-setting fundraising and JFK comparisons obscured a basic contradiction between Beto O\u2019Rourke the national heartthrob and Beto O\u2019Rourke the Texas heretic. While the coastal media\u2019s narrative emphasized his appeals to common ground, framing him as an Obamaesque post-partisan figure, the candidate himself tacked unapologetically leftward. He endorsed Bernie Sanders\u2019 \"Medicare for all\" plan. He called repeatedly for President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment\u2014a position rejected by Nancy Pelosi, and nearly every other prominent Democrat in America, as futile and counterproductive. He flirted with the idea of abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He took these positions, and others, with a brash fearlessness that reinforced his superstardom in the eyes of the Democratic base nationwide. But it likely stunted his growth among a more important demographic: Texans.\n\nOver the past six months, I spoke with a host of Texas Republicans about the U.S. Senate race. Many of them dislike Cruz. Some of them privately hope he loses. And all of them are baffled by the disconnect between the superior branding of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy and what they see as the tactical malpractice of his campaign.\n\nIn their view, Cruz is uniquely vulnerable, having alienated Texans of all ideological stripes with his first-term antics\u2014and especially those affluent, college-educated suburbanites repelled by Trump. The senator has long lagged 10 to 15 points behind Governor Greg Abbott at the top of the ticket; Cruz\u2019s internal modeling has consistently demonstrated there are several hundred thousand voters committed to Abbott but not to him. This is the paradox of the Texas Senate race: Though it\u2019s clear a significant bloc of soft Republicans and conservative-leaning independents are open to rejecting the incumbent on Tuesday, it\u2019s equally clear the challenger has done little to move them. The Quinnipiac poll in April showed O\u2019Rourke pulling 6 percent of Republicans; by late October that number was 3 percent. And while there are signs to suggest he will win more votes than a traditional Democrat in the metropolitan areas of Dallas and Houston and San Antonio, O\u2019Rourke is almost certain to underperform in the rural and exurban areas of the state.\n\nThe campaign is a study in extreme contrasts: Cruz, the cartoonishly unlikeable conservative whose machine-like enterprise is run by a platoon of political gurus, versus O\u2019Rourke, the obnoxiously likeable liberal whose garage-band effort is guided by gut instinct and raw emotion. Nothing is certain in such a volatile political climate, and there have been indications of a tightening race in the campaign\u2019s final days. Cruz learned first-hand in 2016 that an organizational advantage doesn\u2019t guarantee victory ; O\u2019Rourke can draw inspiration from Trump, of all people, in proving the pollsters wrong. If O\u2019Rourke wins, he will have revealed a blueprint for animating the base and turning out new voters. But if he loses\u2014as Texas insiders in both parties expect\u2014the autopsies will speak of a strategically imbalanced campaign that did too much mobilizing and not enough persuading.\n\n\u201cDespite all of Cruz\u2019s problems\u2014and there are plenty\u2014here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s running around talking about Medicare for all, and impeaching Trump, and abolishing ICE. And it\u2019s killing him,\u201d Karl Rove, the former senior adviser to George W. Bush, told me in Austin this summer. \u201cEven for people who dislike Cruz, impeaching Trump strikes many of them as terrible for the country. I\u2019ve got friends and family members who may not vote for Cruz. They don\u2019t like Cruz. But Beto isn\u2019t contesting them. I mean, it\u2019s just weird.\u201d\n\nDavid Axelrod, the former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and Rove\u2019s counterpart as the Democratic Party\u2019s strategic elder statesman, said O\u2019Rourke \u201chas staked out some positions that are difficult positions for some of these voters in the middle to embrace,\u201d adding, \u201cI think one of the strengths of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy is that he hasn\u2019t shaded his positions. But I acknowledge that may be a problem for some of these independent and moderate Republican voters and conservative Democrats.\u201d\n\nTurning out base voters is job No. 1 for any campaign. But rallying Democrats against Cruz was never the difficult part of defeating him. In 2012, Cruz\u2019s general election opponent, Paul Sadler, captured 41 percent of the vote despite having no name recognition and raising roughly $700,000 for the entire election. O\u2019Rourke raised 54 times that amount in the third quarter alone. Yet if the polling holds up, O\u2019Rourke stands to improve on Sadler\u2019s showing by just 3 or 4 points.\n\nMaybe 45 percent is simply the ceiling for a Democrat in Texas. But this is overly simplistic. Trump won Tennessee by 26 points\u2014nearly three times the margin of his Texas victory\u2014and that state\u2019s U.S. Senate race has been a dead heat, in large part because the Democrat, former governor Phil Bredesen, is selling a smartly packaged centrism. If O\u2019Rourke loses, Texas might remember him for being singularly positioned to break that ceiling\u2014running in an advantageous environment, against a damaged incumbent, bringing historic resources to bear, at a moment of cultural and demographic transition in the state\u2014and failing to capitalize.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst campaign I\u2019ve ever run against\u2014or it\u2019s the most brilliant,\" Jeff Roe, Cruz\u2019s chief strategist, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s the best and worst opponent we could have faced. He energized the left and raised tons of money, but had no plan for how to spend it and no plan for building the sort of coalition needed for a Democrat to win in Texas. He ran an entire campaign without pursuing a single Republican vote.\u201d (I reached out numerous times this fall to the O\u2019Rourke campaign seeking an interview about their strategy; his spokesman, Chris Evans, told me after a recent debate in San Antonio that they were no longer talking to national media outlets.)\n\nGiven his sudden star power and prodigious fundraising abilities, there is already considerable momentum behind the theory that O\u2019Rourke could segue from a losing Senate candidate to a top-tier presidential contender. But with a debate beginning to rage inside the Democratic Party over how best to defeat Trump\u2014galvanizing the left or recapturing the center\u2014a lopsided loss in Texas could force O\u2019Rourke to answer tough questions relating to ideology and strategy. What exactly, inquiring and envious Democratic minds will want to know, did he do with that $70 million? Why wasn\u2019t he barraging persuadable Republicans with mail and phone calls and door knocks? Could he not identify them because of his campaign\u2019s refusal to invest in polling and data analytics? Did he consciously avoid playing on their issues, determining it was more profitable for his political future to lose as a liberal than compete as a moderate? What was to be gained by calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment? And what evidence exists of his appeal to the middle of the electorate?\n\nO\u2019Rourke can\u2019t be blamed for receiving media hype. He shouldn\u2019t be penalized for hauling in historic sums of cash. And he didn\u2019t ask to be vaulted into the 2020 presidential conversation. There is no disputing his intelligence, his magnetism, his earnestness. But elections are ultimately defined by wins and losses. Should O\u2019Rourke suffer an anticlimactic defeat, given the fanfare surrounding his ascent, it will be fair to ask: Did the country\u2019s best candidate run its worst campaign?\n\n***\n\nIt was the perfect rebuttal to the perfect back-handed compliment. At the end of their first debate, in late September, the moderators asked Cruz and O\u2019Rourke to compliment one another. O\u2019Rourke observed that Cruz was a devoted father, saluting his public service at the expense of time with his young family. Cruz responded by praising O\u2019Rourke as \u201cpassionate\u201d and \u201cenergetic,\u201d saying, \u201cHe believes in what he is fighting for.\u201d He should have left it there. Instead, Cruz proceeded to compare O\u2019Rourke to Bernie Sanders\u2014ideologues who have crazy ideas, but who are \u201cabsolutely sincere\u201d in believing them. \u201cTrue to form,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in disgust.\n\nThe moment crystallized their stylistic divergence: Cruz, the smarmy, calculating bare-knuckle brawler, landing a low blow against O\u2019Rourke, the sincere, fresh-faced romantic. But there was more to it. Beneath the senator\u2019s characteristic lack of self-awareness, his comment about O\u2019Rourke reflected a combination of admiration and relief. Cruz clearly sees a little bit of himself in his challenger\u2014a scrappy underdog rejecting conventional wisdom and running to his party\u2019s flank on every issue. The difference is that Cruz played this role as a conservative in a Republican primary, whereas O\u2019Rourke is a Democrat in a general election. \u201cSincerity is rare in politics. And I\u2019m a true believer as well,\u201d Cruz told me following the debate. \u201cBoth Beto and I are fighting for principles and values we believe in. The difference is, the principles and values I\u2019m fighting for are also the ones the vast majority of Texans support.\u201d\n\nHence the relief. Cruz always knew, coming off his dehumanizing defeat in the 2016 presidential race and heading into his Senate reelection, that Democrats would place a symbolic value on his scalp. He and his team braced for a challenge from the center. This is how Democrats win in red states\u2014not by painting bold contrasts but by minimizing differences. So when O\u2019Rourke entered the race, riding auspicious headlines from the Hurd road trip and preaching the politics of ceasefire, everything seemed to be on schedule. Until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nCruz and O'Rourke spar during a debate at McFarlin Auditorium at SMU on September 21, 2018 in Dallas, Texas. | Tom Fox-Pool/Getty Images\n\nAs his candidacy wore on, O\u2019Rourke took ownership of positions further to the left\u2014on guns, immigration, drug legalization\u2014than anyone in either party expected. But he did so delicately, still elevating unifying thematic strokes over divisive policy specifics. Then came the Democratic primary in March. Despite being the de facto nominee, opposed by two unknowns who raised less than $10,000 between them, O\u2019Rourke lost dozens of majority-minority counties to a 32-year-old \u201cBerniecrat\u201d with a Hispanic surname. The takeaway: He had work to do with the base.\n\nInstead of pivoting to the center, as spring gave way to summer, the Democratic nominee hardened his positions. Where he had once hedged on his endorsement of \"Medicare for all,\" O\u2019Rourke began forcefully championing a single-payer system. Where he once avoided impeachment talk, O\u2019Rourke reiterated, on the day he and Hurd received an award for civility in politics, that Trump should be removed from office. Where he once carefully straddled the border-security debate, O\u2019Rourke said he was open to abolishing ICE if its duties could be assumed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cEverything Beto did to define his campaign early on was about process and anti-corporatizing politics. It really wasn\u2019t issue-based. It was about getting to every county in Texas, talking to people in small towns, hosting townhalls,\u201d said James Aldrete, a Texas Democratic strategist who ran the Spanish-language media strategy for both Obama campaigns and for Hillary Clinton in 2016. As the campaign became more policy-heavy, Aldrete conceded, \u201cHe never made a political adjustment to reach out to the middle.\u201d\n\nFor Cruz, this was manna from heaven. The senator was vulnerable to a persuasion campaign\u2014a contest predicated on mass movement of independents and soft partisans\u2014and O\u2019Rourke had once been poised to run one. Out of the gate, the challenger\u2019s hustle to every one of Texas\u2019 254 counties had struck a brilliant contrast with the incumbent senator; Cruz had boasted of visiting all 99 Iowa counties when running for president yet hadn\u2019t paid the same attention to his own state. The incumbent, having scrambled since 2016 to repair relations with the Texas business community and establish a more robust presence back home, spent this year campaigning not as a partisan warrior but as a productive legislator. When I followed him for a day in July, there was no talk of government shutdowns or ideological brinkmanship. The senator spoke primarily of the \u201cfederal benefits\u201d his constituents were \u201centitled to\u201d as part of the recovery from Hurricane Harvey. The Cruz of 2012 believed he was elected to burn down the system; the Cruz of 2018 believed his reelection hinged on being the system.\n\nAll the while, O\u2019Rourke hit populist, mostly nonpartisan notes wherever he went, refusing to go negative against Cruz. But it became increasingly evident that O\u2019Rourke was running a mobilization campaign\u2014seemingly convinced that his best shot was to light a fire on the left and attract historic numbers of new voters. This was apparent in his cultural speak as much as his policy positions. Perhaps the defining moment of the race\u2014and the clearest evidence of an inverse relationship between national enthusiasm and Texas enthusiasm\u2014came in late August at a Houston townhall. When an audience member expressed frustration with NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, asking O\u2019Rourke whether he thought it was disrespectful, the candidate launched into an impassioned monologue reciting America\u2019s history of racial injustice and nonviolent protests. \u201cI can think of nothing more American,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthan to peacefully stand up or take a knee for your rights anytime, anywhere, anyplace.\u201d\n\nThe video went viral, amassing some 50 million views to date. Athletes tweeted their support. Ellen DeGeneres invited O\u2019Rourke on her show. Online fundraising went through the roof. And it was exactly what Cruz needed. His campaign\u2019s internal polls had tightened. Around the time the video exploded online, Cruz had dropped into the mid-40s and the candidates were in a statistical tie for the first time. O\u2019Rourke's response\u2014to a question, it turns out, asked by Roe\u2019s employee\u2014provided just the cultural wedge issue Cruz needed. His team quickly brought in Tim Lee, a double-amputee Vietnam veteran, to tape attack ads. Airing first online and then on television, keeping the anthem story front-and-center for weeks in the Texas press, Lee says in the spots, \u201cI gave two legs for this country. I\u2019m unable to stand, but I sure expect you to stand for me when that national anthem is being played.\u201d\n\nBy the end of September, according to tracking numbers I reviewed, Cruz\u2019s lead had ballooned back to double digits statewide\u2014and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s support in the outbound areas of the state\u2019s four major cities had plummeted. It seemed unfair: O\u2019Rourke had been nuanced and eloquent in his response, saluting the military and emphasizing that people of goodwill could disagree on the matter, yet Cruz had seized on the final soundbite to paint him as a radical. But distinctions, not fairness, are the currency of a campaign\u2014and the sharper those distinctions, the more primitive and oversimplified, the better. In the boiled-down shorthand of electoral politics, O\u2019Rourke sided with minorities and national anthem protesters; Cruz sided with military members and the American flag.\n\nIn Texas\u2014for the time being, anyway\u2014it\u2019s not hard to tell which side has majority support.\n\n***\n\nThe signs are everywhere. All across the Lone Star State, lining rural highways and dotting urban cityscapes, \u201cBETO\u201d is inescapable. Texas is dauntingly large, especially for a congressman from El Paso, so in lieu of a ground game O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign settled on a strategy of drowning the state in yard signs. For Republicans, the signs became bothersome to a point where some party officials confronted Cruz, both in Texas and in Washington, demanding to know why his campaign hadn\u2019t made a similar effort. The answer\u2014that Roe\u2019s research showed yard signs have zero impact on election outcomes\u2014proved insufficient. As his rival\u2019s logo proliferated around the state, Cruz\u2019s campaign eventually relented and began distributing lawn decor of its own.\n\nThe black-and-white coloring of the O\u2019Rourke insignia is thematically suiting\u2014hip, futuristic, politically neutral\u2014speaking to the campaign\u2019s slick approach to marketing. The candidate\u2019s online merchandise store offers some variations of the monochrome style. One is a colorful design, oranges and blues, targeting Hispanics: \u201cBeto Por Texas.\u201d Another is geared toward the LGBT community, with the standard \u201cBETO\u201d font splayed over a pride flag. But there is one curious oversight: Nothing in the store says, \u201cRepublicans for Beto.\u201d When I searched that phrase online, I found a T-shirt on Amazon with a single review (three stars), as well as an unofficial Facebook page with 211 likes. That was it\u2014no sanctioned apparel, no grassroots organization and certainly no coordinated effort on behalf of the campaign.\n\nDemocrats in Texas swear that O\u2019Rourke has made inroads with Republican voters. And strategists in both parties have told me that in several of Texas\u2019 competitive, suburban-based congressional districts, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy has boosted Democratic challengers against GOP incumbents. Yet evidence of widespread defection of Republicans into his camp remains elusive. O\u2019Rourke unwittingly played into this himself when, after months of citing his \u201clifelong Republican\u201d mother as an example of Texas voters switching partisan allegiances, CNN reported that \u201cMelissa O'Rourke has largely voted in Democratic primaries in Texas since 2000.\u201d\n\nO'Rourke addresses supporters with a megaphone during a campaign rally in Mueller Lake Park on October 31, 2018 in Austin, Texas. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign\u2019s approach to winning self-identified Republicans is critical because they represent the biggest bloc of eligible voters in the state. That won\u2019t always be the case. Much of the intrigue undergirding this campaign owes to the demographic changes engulfing Texas\u2014not just the rising Latino share of the voting-age population, but the massive influx of young, educated liberals drawn to its big cities by the state\u2019s booming job market. The assumption that a growing minority vote would imminently turn Texas blue, as it has other states, ignores the state\u2019s history. Texas was unique in importing huge swaths of the Mexican middle class a century ago, and Latinos in the state have traditionally had higher incomes and education levels than in other states as a result. Combine this with the cultural conservatism of Texas and the state\u2019s practice of electing diversity-embracing Republicans in the mold of George W. Bush, and its Latino population has not behaved politically like those in California or Arizona.\n\nAs a result, Republicans have typically captured roughly 40 percent of the Latino vote in Texas. But that could change. Trump won just 34 percent there in 2016, and his perceived hostility toward the Hispanic community\u2014warning of Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d separating migrant families at the southern border, belittling a Mexican-born U.S. judge\u2014could be reshaping its long-term views of the GOP, particularly among younger voters. Cruz is quick to distance himself from the president in this regard\u2014\u201cDonald Trump says many things I would not say\u201d\u2014and predicts he will take 40 percent of the Hispanic vote himself against O\u2019Rourke. But the writing is on the wall. Even if eligible Latinos continue voting at lower rates than whites or blacks, their sheer numbers are making the math increasingly difficult for the GOP to surmount. \u201cFor Texas to stay red, Republicans have to do more to earn the votes of Hispanic voters,\u201d Cruz told me. \u201cThose demographic trends are undeniable.\u201d\n\nWhat it means to \u201cdo more\u201d depends on which Republican you ask. Hurd, a non-Spanish-speaking black Republican who has nonetheless built an outstanding brand in his majority-Hispanic district, told me last year that the future of Texas\u2019 statewide elections will be won between the 40-yard lines; that a rapidly diversifying electorate will demand more from the GOP than hard-line ideological conservatism. Cruz smirked when I mentioned this. Sensing that Hurd\u2019s point was about immigration policy, Cruz told me \u201cthe No. 1 priority for Hispanic voters is jobs.\u201d He then took a moment to clarify that we were talking about his community. \u201cI\u2019m the first Hispanic U.S. senator ever to represent Texas,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is true. Which makes some of his decisions\u2014allying with Trump on the border wall, palling around with race-baiting congressman Steve King, referring to illegal immigrants as \u201cundocumented Democrats\u201d\u2014somewhat puzzling. Indeed, it is precisely Cruz\u2019s identity that frames the Senate race in potentially Shakespearean terms. Could the Cuban-American tea party sensation who rose to national stardom on the gamble that Texans craved an uncompromising brand of conservatism become the first victim of the state\u2019s shifting political landscape\u2014and of the Hispanic community\u2019s mobilization against Trump\u2019s Republican Party?\n\nProbably not. O\u2019Rourke has worked the Latino vote hard, spending millions of dollars in the past few weeks alone on Spanish-language television and radio ads. But between his underwhelming performance in the Democratic primary and the good-but-not-great indicators from early voting in October, Texas insiders believe he simply has too much ground to make up. There\u2019s also the matter of his name. Cruz was widely mocked earlier in the cycle for drawing attention to the fact that O\u2019Rourke is not Hispanic\u2014that Beto is a nickname for Robert\u2014when he was himself born Rafael. It was a cynical ploy, especially given Cruz\u2019s broken bilingualism and O\u2019Rourke\u2019s fluent espa\u00f1ol. It was also a Machiavellian master stroke: Low-information Hispanic voters have a documented history of voting reflexively for candidates with Hispanic surnames, and Cruz, who suffers nothing among his own base for going by Ted instead of Rafael, knew that every story on the controversy would further inform the masses that O\u2019Rourke is not, in fact, Hispanic.\n\nIt was a telling episode in Texas\u2019 demographics-driven new era of identity politics. After four consecutive presidential cycles of landslide double-digit victories, Republicans carried the state by 9 points in 2016\u2014a smaller margin than in battleground Iowa\u2014and there were red flags galore. Harris County, anchored by Houston and home to swelling populations of both Hispanics and college-educated whites, was carried by Clinton by 162,000 votes; in 2012, Obama beat Mitt Romney there by fewer than 600 votes. Harris, the state\u2019s most populous county, has never been carried by a Texas Democrat in a non-presidential year. O\u2019Rourke is expected to break that streak this November. And while it may not accompany a statewide victory, these trends in the Houston area\u2014and in the other cities and sprawling suburbs around the state\u2014portend a troubling future for Texas Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here awhile. We were supposed to turn into a blue state by 2006. And then it was going to be 2012. And then 2018,\u201d Rove told me. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got another 12 years. But we\u2019d better get our act together, and that means fewer Ted Cruzes and more George W. Bushes.\u201d\n\nRove grinned. \u201cRobert Francis O\u2019Rourke is running as \u2018Beto,\u2019 and Rafael Cruz is running as \u2018Ted,\u2019\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cOnly in Texas could we have the Anglo pretending to be Latino, and the Latino pretending to be Anglo.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFor political junkies, the homestretch in Texas has been as instructive as it has been entertaining. By mid-October, with Cruz\u2019s lead holding steady and O\u2019Rourke running out of time, the Democratic challenger came under enormous pressure to go on the offensive. As the incumbent pummeled his opponent with millions of dollars of attack ads, Democratic panic resembled the Republican freakout months earlier during the yard sign onslaught: Why aren\u2019t you doing something about this?\n\nO\u2019Rourke finally took the gloves off during a San Antonio debate, resurrecting Trump\u2019s \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d caricature and jabbing the senator\u2019s unsavory reputation in Washington. But within days O\u2019Rourke expressed regret at his tactics, saying he never wanted to run a negative race. The episode highlighted both the upside and downside of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s approach to unseating Cruz. \u201cOn the one hand, you give him credit\u2014he\u2019s changing the game. No pollsters, no consultants,\u201d Aldrete, the Democratic strategist, said. \u201cBut when you face millions of dollars in negative ads, do you have a process to push back? As they defined him, which I think they have, there were limitations in what he was able to do. But I give him credit for running the race he wants to run.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that O\u2019Rourke has been defined. While his favorability numbers with Texas Democrats are sky-high, several recent polls showed him with the highest unfavorable rating of any politician in the state. Meanwhile, Cruz\u2019s campaign has been unrelenting, rolling out a series of closing attack ads meant to step on the challenger\u2019s neck. On paper, having raised $70 million\u2014at least double what Cruz has accrued since the beginning of 2017\u2014O\u2019Rourke should have the resources to counter every negative Cruz spot with a positive one of his own. Yet that isn\u2019t the case; while O\u2019Rourke continues to pump historic amounts of money into digital advertising, primarily via Facebook, Cruz outspent him on television in the final two weeks of October. And, according to media-buy figures, Cruz is poised to outspend O\u2019Rourke by nearly $1 million in the campaign\u2019s final weeks.\n\nO'Rourke appears at a campaign rally at White Oak Music Hall on October 8, 2018 in Houston, Texas. | Loren Elliott/Getty Images\n\nStrategists in both parties seemed dumbfounded by this. An acceptable explanation would be that O\u2019Rourke has dumped enormous resources elsewhere\u2014a historic early-voting turnout operation aimed at Hispanics, perhaps. But nobody I spoke with on the ground had seen or heard of such an effort. O\u2019Rourke has, over the past two months, spent millions of dollars on field programs. And Texas did see a considerable uptick in early voting among young people and Hispanics. But Cruz, Abbott and the state GOP have a stellar ground game of their own, and early-voting figures also spiked among whites, suggesting a high-turnout election across the board.\n\nFor Cruz, that\u2019s actually good news. His team\u2019s forecast of total turnout has hovered between 6 million and 6.5 million, and they have yet to see a model in which O\u2019Rourke hits 3 million votes\u2014making it something of a \u201cmagic number\u201d for Cruz. They expect to win 65 percent of whites and hope to hit 40 percent among Hispanics. (There could be an inverted relationship in his performance among the two groups: Cruz\u2019s numbers dropped noticeably in the Houston area following his recent rally with Trump, consultants in both parties told me, but his numbers in the exurban and rural areas spiked in offsetting fashion.)\n\nThe math for O\u2019Rourke, Democrats acknowledge, is more complicated. He likely needs at least 13 percent of voters to be African-American, and has to win 90 percent of them; he needs at least 17 percent to be Latino, and win 65 percent of them; and then he needs to win 40 percent of white voters. This is not impossible; when Obama flipped Hispanic-heavy states such as Nevada and Colorado in 2008, the key was his breaking 40 percent among whites. The problem for O\u2019Rourke is that white voters in Texas behave more like southern Republicans than western Republicans; many are culturally and politically programmed to lean right of center. In the event of a photo-finish defeat, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s failure to capture more of these voters would be the likely explanation.\n\nTexas Democrats I spoke with agreed that their nominee's struggle to persuade Republicans made winning difficult\u2014if not impossible. But placing this election in the contextual sweep of the state\u2019s modern history, they said the lasting sting of a loss would be felt in the Democratic Party\u2019s continued inability to mobilize minority voters. \u201cThere needed to be more resources spent around Beto, more organization and more fundamental work done to turn out the base,\u201d said Matt Angle, president of the Lone Star Project, a liberal activist group. \u201cBeto has done a good job of energizing new [white] voters, but there\u2019s an underlying Latino and African-American base here that could have been mobilized. If he loses a close race, I\u2019ll look at that as the missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nIf he loses a race that\u2019s not close, O\u2019Rourke will be haunted by questions about his campaign operation\u2014especially if he parlays his Senate candidacy into a presidential run. His skyrocketing name ID, personal dynamism and aspirational oratory would no doubt make him formidable in a packed 2020 primary field. There\u2019s a reason that he\u2019s drawing comparisons to Obama. \u201cThe policy stuff is important, and he\u2019s definitely staked out positions on the left, but I think the reason people are responding to him has more to do with character, more to do with the positive nature of his presentation, a sense of inclusiveness,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cI think Beto has in that sense touched a very important chord.\u201d\n\nStill, I couldn\u2019t help but recall a different conversation with Axelrod several years ago. This one was reflecting on Marco Rubio\u2019s failed presidential campaign. His words serve as a reminder of the paramount importance of campaign mechanics\u2014and, quite possibly, as a cautionary tale should Betomania migrate from Texas to Iowa.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a candidate as charismatic as Rubio, the people around him buy into the cult of personality,\u201d Axelrod told me. \u201cYou know, Barack Obama is a charismatic guy, but we also had a very detailed plan on how to get from A to B. If all we had done was rely on his charisma in Iowa and not built the greatest organization the state had ever seen, we would not have won the Iowa caucuses.\u201d\n\nTim Alberta is chief political correspondent at Politico Magazine.", "Photo Gallery\n\nLast days: Midterm candidates shake, battle and troll\n\nCandidates across the country embarked this weekend on a furious dash of final-hour campaigning, racing through diners, football stadiums and even a petting zoo to rally supporters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections.

But strategists in both parties say the race is closer and point to the large number of votes cast during the now-concluded early voting period in Tennessee and other Senate battlegrounds as reason for greater uncertainty.\n\nTwo states, Texas and Nevada, have already surpassed total turnout levels in 2014 as citizens rush to the polls during early voting, according to data from the U.S. Election Project, which tracks voter turnout and is run by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald. Arizona and Tennessee are close behind, with early voter turnout within 60,000 votes of total turnout in the 2014 midterms in both states.\n\n\u201cThe early vote in states like Nevada and Arizona has been very strong,\u201d Van Hollen said Sunday. \u201cIt does appear young voters are coming out.\u201d\n\nThat higher youth turnout in Arizona is good news for Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who is battling GOP Rep. Martha McSally in one of the cycle\u2019s most hotly contested Senate races, which recent polls show is neck-and-neck.

That could help Democrats chip away further at Republicans\u2019 dwindling relative advantage: As of the end of the day Saturday, registered Republicans had cast only 28,000 more votes than Democrats out of 4.8 million early and absentee votes thus far.\n\nTrump was joined Sunday in Macon, Ga., by Kemp \u2014 who bailed on a long-planned televised debate with his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, to join the president on the hustings instead. There, Trump repeatedly praised Kemp and contrasted the Republican with Abrams, describing her as \u201cone of the most extreme far-left politicians in the country\" who \"wants illegal aliens to be part of the blue wave\" and will restrict gun ownership if elected.\n\nThe president added that he thinks the chances of a Democratic wave seemed to be fading. \u201cBut you better get out and vote; otherwise I\u2019m going to look very bad with this statement,\" he added.\n\nKemp's position as secretary of state in Georgia has put him in the controversial role of having oversight of an election in which he\u2019s competing. Voting rights and integrity were reignited as election flashpoints Sunday morning, when Kemp\u2019s office announced, in a press release, that it had opened an investigation into the state Democratic Party after what it called \u201ca failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we cannot comment on the specifics of an ongoing investigation, I can confirm that the Democratic Party of Georgia is under investigation for possible cyber crimes,\" said Candice Broce, Kemp\u2019s press secretary. \"We can also confirm that no personal data was breached and our system remains secure.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party of Georgia, in a statement, called the announcement a \u201cpolitical stunt.\u201d And Abrams, in an interview on CNN on Sunday, slammed Kemp.\n\n\"I've heard nothing about it, and my reaction would be that this is a desperate attempt on the part of my opponent to distract people from the fact that two different federal judges found him derelict in his duties,\" Abrams said on \u201cState of the Union,\" citing court decisions that said Kemp's office was too restrictive in its application of voting laws regarding registrations and accepting absentee ballots.\n\nWhile Trump was headed to Georgia, former President Barack Obama was in Gary, Ind., campaigning for Sen. Joe Donnelly, one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators up for reelection this year. While there, Obama went after Trump and Republicans\u2019 closing message of the election, arguing that their focus on the migrant caravan and immigration was done to inspire fear in voters, but that sometimes \u201ctactics of scaring people and making stuff up work.\"\n\n\u201cWhile they're trying to distract you with of all this stuff, they're robbing you blind,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey'll be like, 'Look, look, look: Caravan, caravan,' and then they're giving tax cuts to their billionaire friends.\u201d\n\nLater Sunday, Obama traveled to his hometown of Chicago to stump for gubernatorial candidate J.B. Pritzker and two Democratic congressional hopefuls in northern Illinois: Sean Casten and Lauren Underwood, who are challenging GOP Reps. Peter Roskam and Randy Hultgren, respectively. More than 5,000 people were in attendance at the University of Illinois-Chicago.\n\nMeanwhile, in Massachusetts, where Elizabeth Warren is ahead by 20 percentage points in her bid for a second term this week, the potential Democratic presidential candidate was still on the campaign trail Sunday, warning about the possible consequences of continued GOP control of Congress.\n\n\"If they get the votes, they're coming back after health care again,\" Warren said, reiterating a well-traveled Democratic talking point this fall.\n\nThe potential Democratic takeover of the House has drawn the lion's share of attention in the final days of the campaign. On Saturday, in two suburban Philadelphia districts, candidates cast the outcome as either a badly needed check on Trump \u2014 or the start of a worrisome phase of governance.\n\nIn Bucks County, Pa., Democrat Scott Wallace, who\u2019s running against GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, rallied with Gov. Tom Wolf, Sen. Bob Casey and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois.\n\n\u201cWe have to turn the House blue,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cThen we can get some real accountability in Washington.\u201d\n\nBut across the Delaware River in New Jersey, GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur \u2014 who\u2019s locked in a tight race with Democrat Andy Kim \u2014 warned Republicans outside the Burlington County GOP headquarters of what might happen if Democrats win back control of Congress.\n\n\"Tuesday, we have to win, because we don't want a dysfunctional government for the next two years,\" MacArthur said. \"And that's what we'll get if Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are just there to divide the country.\"\n\nAnd in California's Central Valley, endangered GOP Rep.

China\u2019s official purchasing manager\u2019s index has shown new export orders have been contracting since June.\n\nA tactic that works \u2014 for now\n\n\n\nDing Shuang, the chief China economist at Standard Chartered bank, who has just visited exporters in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said many companies were doing the same as Seagull and the production frenzy could last the rest of the year.\n\n\u201cIncreased demand for shipments has pushed up shipping rates and some exporters are even having trouble finding any space on cargo ships,\u201d Ding said. But the situation could quickly turn bad next year, he warned, as exporters face a double blow from fewer new orders and a sharp depletion of existing orders.\n\nSo far, the trade war has not had any significant impact on China\u2019s trade and broad economy. Manufacturers\u2019 front-loading may be partly responsible.\n\nChina\u2019s exports rose 14.5 percent in September from a year earlier, accelerating from a 9.8 percent rise in August. Meanwhile, its trade surplus with the U.S., its biggest export market, widened to a record $34 billion last month.\n\nIn Guangdong, China\u2019s export manufacturing hub, the economy expanded 6.9 percent during the first three quarters of 2018 from a year ago, or slightly higher than the nationwide growth rate of 6.7 percent for the period.\n\nGuangdong\u2019s exports posted a modest rise of 0.4 percent in the first nine months of the year, rebounding from a 3.3 percent decline in the first half, implying strong third-quarter gains.\n\nThe stronger exports figure was supported by activity at factories like Seagull\u2019s. The question is what will these factories do once those orders have been completed, particularly if U.S. clients reduce or even stop orders because of the extra tariff costs.\n\nAn exit strategy?\n\n\n\nListed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Guangzhou Seagull is one of a few Chinese listed companies to have disclosed the possible impact on their operations from the U.S. tariffs.\n\nThe maker of high-end kitchen and bath plumbing products and bathroom furnishings for brands in the United States, Europe and Asia said in a statement that its tap components, the main product line it exports to the U.S., were on the new tariff list.\n\nThe company\u2019s U.S. sales exceeded 372 million yuan in the first half of this year, accounting for about half of its export revenue and more than 35 percent of its total revenue.\n\nSeagull said it was working with its U.S. clients to apply for a one-year exemption from the tariffs.\n\nIf this does not work, its U.S. clients will have to raise sales prices. Some of its U.S. clients have asked Seagull to \u201cshoulder part of the extra costs\u201d, but the company said it was trying to avoid that.\n\nIt said it had started talking to some U.S. clients about moving production out of China. \u201cWe will proactively explore the proposal of setting up factories abroad to maintain relations with U.S. clients,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nIts investor relations office declined to comment further on its plans for managing the impact of the trade war. It also declined to reveal information about its internal production arrangement.\n\nGround shifts beneath Chinese firms\n\n\n\nGuangzhou Seagull was set up in 1998, backed by Taiwanese businesspeople, with China\u2019s labor-intensive export-oriented manufacturing industry thriving thanks to cheap labor and high demand from the United States, Europe and Hong Kong.\n\nMainland officials rolled out red carpets for investors from Taiwan and Hong Kong to build factories. A local worker in Guangzhou cost 400 to 500 yuan a month, whereas a skilled Hong Kong worker made 20 times that at the time.\n\nThe business grew quickly in the 2000s by making products mainly for the U.S. and Europe, but the fundamentals that made it successful have changed since. Labor, rent and raw material costs have soared, eating up profits and making Chinese products less competitive. Tariffs have only made things worse.", "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about rhetoric.

That marks a slight decline from last month, when Democrats led on the generic congressional ballot by 11 points, and a bigger drop from August, when they enjoyed a 14-point advantage.\n\n\u201cDemocrats also have a 51-to- 44 percent advantage among likely voters identified by The Post. That seven-point margin, which is in line with other polls taken in the past two weeks, puts Democrats roughly within range of what they probably will need in the overall national vote for the House to capture a majority from the Republicans, based on calculations from previous midterm campaigns.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- WSJ poll story, by Janet Hook.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Andrew Cuomo to Republican challenger Marc Molinaro by a 49-36 margin, according to a poll released by the Siena College Research Institute on Sunday.\n\nCuomo's 13-point lead in the five-way race is a significant decrease from past polls. In a survey released at the beginning of October, Siena found Cuomo with a lead of 22 points at a time when there were six candidates in the race, including Cynthia Nixon. In a one-on-one match with Molinaro, Siena gave Cuomo an 18-point lead. A Quinnipiac poll from mid-October found Cuomo with a 23-point edge in a one-on-one contest.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCuomo\u2019s favorability rating also fell to the lowest level in the eight years since he\u2019s been in office, with 45 percent of likely voters viewing him positively and 49 percent holding a negative view.\n\nThe shift is due in part to Molinaro making gains among his base. Republicans supported him 59-21 a month ago; they now back him by a 74-12 margin. The challenger also made significant gains among men, who backed Cuomo 44-32 and now support Molinaro 45-41, and residents of the downstate suburbs, whose preference for Cuomo fell from 54-30 to 44-41.\n\nThe numbers certainly aren\u2019t what a candidate looking for a big win would hope for.

Will Democrats and New York City voters turnout in bigger numbers than they have in recent midterms? If so, Cuomo has the chance to run up the score. If not, or if Republican enthusiasm matches increased Democratic enthusiasm \u2014 particularly in upstate and the suburbs where there are hotly contested House and State Senate races \u2014 then the final results will likely look similar to four years ago.\u201d\n\nCuomo won his 2014 race against Rob Astorino by 14 points.\n\nIn the attorney general\u2019s race, Democrat Tish James\u2019 modest but comfortable edge over Republican Keith Wofford mostly held steady.

Kirsten Gillibrand has a 58-35 lead over Chele Farley. And Comptroller Tom DiNapoli's lead over Jonathan Trichter is at 62-25.\n\nAll of the Republicans continue to suffer from a severe lack of name recognition. Some 46 percent of likely voters don\u2019t know enough about Molinaro to hold an opinion on him.

View the crosstabs here.", "", "We all know liberals and conservatives are different, broadly speaking. They disagree about immigration, global warming and health care. They consume different brands. The stereotypes tell us liberals eat arugula and drive hatchbacks, while conservatives prefer pork rinds and pickup trucks. These two political classes are so dissimilar that people like to joke they are \u201cwired differently.\u201d\n\nBut it turns out that might literally be true. Recent brain science suggests there are measurable differences in how liberal and conservative brains process information\u2014distinctions that could have significant impact on what happens on Election Day.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFirst, a little background. The brain divides our thought life into two activities: appreciating what we have and desiring what we need. What we have is experienced through the five senses plus our emotions. The brain uses a cocktail of chemicals to orchestrate these experiences that might be called the \u201cHere & Now\u201d brain chemicals, chemicals like oxytocin, which encourages us focus on intimate relationships, and endorphins, which provide feelings of fulfillment and satisfaction.\n\nBy contrast, desiring what we don\u2019t have is the domain of a single chemical in the brain: dopamine. It gives us the drive to pursue new things. You know the feeling of that dopamine \u201cbuzz\u201d when you find a package on your doorstep and can\u2019t wait to open it, when you think you might have a shot at a promotion, or when you\u2019re out shopping for a new phone.\n\nDopamine orients us to the future. It helps us think about possibilities; not what is, but what might be. It drives the ambition of the businessman, the creativity of the artist and the speculation of the scientist. In general, the higher the dopamine level in your brain, the greater the urge you feel to find new things, to create new things\u2014to pursue change.\n\nAnd we know that dopamine activity isn\u2019t purely situational. Some people are born with genes that naturally make their dopamine circuits more active. These people are more likely than others to pursue creative endeavors. Often, they end up as actors, academics, entrepreneurs and writers.\n\nConsider how this might extend to politics. Progressivism, the pursuit of progress, is, by definition, the pursuit of change, of new things. So, we might expect to see progressive ideology in people with more active dopamine circuits. And that\u2019s just what we do find. Researchers from the University of California discovered that people who inherit particularly active dopamine receptor genes are more likely to subscribe to a liberal ideology. (They also tend to get bored easily and seek novelty, and can be impulsive, exploratory, excitable, quick-tempered and extravagant.) It\u2019s no surprise that so many actors, artists, academics and writers tend to be liberal: Dopamine may be driving both their creativity and their politics.\n\nSimilarly, people with lower levels of dopamine and higher levels of the \u201cHere & Now\u201d brain chemicals are more likely to take their enjoyment from the appreciation of things they already have. They value tradition. They take more satisfaction from the here and now enjoyment of, say, watching a football game with friends rather than the future-focused promises of a presidential debate. Not surprisingly, genes that code for a less active dopamine system have been linked to people who identify as conservative politically, who tend to prize tradition and see safety in the status quo. A study of 1,771 students in Singapore found that conservative attitudes were more common among those who had a receptor gene that was less reactive to dopamine.\n\nThis chemical difference can also help explain why liberals tend to be more politically engaged than conservatives. A 2017 study conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that liberals were more likely than conservatives to express political opinions on social media, contact elected officials, donate money to a political campaign, and attend a political rally. If a hundred liberals are marching down the street, it\u2019s most likely a protest. With conservatives, it\u2019s probably a parade.\n\nBut even though under ordinary circumstances liberals are more engaged in the political process, liberals don\u2019t always have the enthusiasm edge. Why? Because conservative brains, chemically inclined toward preserving the here and now, are more sensitive to threats that might undermine their current way of life. When a group of volunteers were divided by political affiliation, researchers found that, compared to liberals, conservatives had a stronger physiological reaction to frightening images, such as a spider crawling on a man\u2019s face. Also, when presented with a selection of positive and negative images, conservatives spent more time gazing at the negative images\u2014pictures that represented a threat.\n\nThis neuroscience suggests that the current confrontational political climate may be helping the conservative cause. News articles that describe public harassment by activists, for example, trigger threat circuits in the brain and can turn the ordinarily complacent conservative into an enthusiastic partisan. Perhaps conservative leaders know this, which is why they frequently emphasize threats. (See the GOP midterm campaign ads accusing Democrats of encouraging \u201cmob rule.\u201d) In response, liberal leaders might reduce conservatives\u2019 motivation to vote by playing down confrontation, and instead emphasizing the commonality all Americans share.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s important to remember that neuroscientists study large groups of people and report on the averages. So, within each group there are plenty who buck the overall trend\u2014call them dopaminergic conservatives and Here & Now liberals. Most scientific study tells us something about groups, but very little about individuals.\n\nBut it\u2019s groups that decide elections, so it\u2019s worth exploring how whether differences in levels of brain chemicals could have consequences in the midterm elections. Biology isn\u2019t destiny, but when you\u2019re playing the odds, it makes sense for both sides to pay attention to the brain.\n\nDaniel Z. Lieberman, a psychiatrist, is a professor at George Washington University and co-author of The Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity\u2014and Will Determine the Fate of the Human Race (BenBella).\n\nMichael E. Long, a writer and playwright who trained as a physicist, is a lecturer at Georgetown University and co-author of The Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity\u2014and Will Determine the Fate of the Human Race (BenBella).", "Be advised: \u201cDemocrats are in danger of going too far left in 2018.\u201d So warn Republicans like Mitt Romney and ex-Democrats like Joe Lieberman and public personae as diverse as James Comey and Howard Schultz. In recent months, the pundit class has determined that the party\u2019s leftward lurch heralds the rise of a \u201cliberal tea party\u201d\u2014a movement that could very well unmoor Democrats from their longstanding center-left traditions, in close imitation of the spiral of events that caused the Republican Party to turn sharply to the right in recent years.\n\nWhat\u2019s fueling this argument? For one, more Democrats have rallied, either noisily or cautiously, around such policy innovations as \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d universal college and a universal basic income. That a smattering of Democratic candidates have elected to call themselves \u201cdemocratic socialists\u201d has only fueled the claim that such programs are \u201csocialist.\u201d \u201cThe center is Harry Truman and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, not Eugene Debs and Michael Harrington,\u201d warned New York Times opinion columnist Bret Stephens recently. (Debs and Harrington were self-identified socialists.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut there\u2019s something wrong with this historical interpretation: Truman strongly supported single-payer health care. Moynihan supported a universal basic income in the 1960s. Dating back to World War II, Democrats sought to make a government-paid education available to as many Americans as possible. If Democrats are marching to the left, that road leads directly back to platforms and politicians who, in their day, commanded wide support and existed firmly in the mainstream of political thought.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, to label these programs \u201csocialist\u201d\u2014which is to say, far outside the center of the political spectrum\u2014reveals a constrained worldview. For over six decades, center-right parties in Europe\u2014in Britain and France, Germany and Austria, and almost everywhere between\u2014have either participated in or acceded to the very same policies.\n\nIn a remarkable way, today\u2019s debate today strongly resembles a broader discussion that occurred in the United States and Europe in the 1940s, amid wartime mobilization and economic reconstruction, and in the decades following.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to dispute the progressive agenda on its merits. There are strong policy arguments running in both directions. But to argue that it breaks with the party\u2019s roots, or that it falls dangerously outside the mainstream, is ahistorical.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhat pundits today decry as a radical turn in Democratic policy and politics actually finds its antecedents in 1944. With the country fully mobilized for war, President Franklin Roosevelt called for \u201ca second Bill of Rights \u2026 an economic bill of rights\u201d that would entitle all Americans to a \u201cuseful and remunerative job,\u201d \u201cthe right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation,\u201d the \u201cright \u2026 to a decent home,\u201d \u201cthe right to adequate medical care\u201d and the \u201cright to a good education.\u201d His speech found partial inspiration in a report by the National Resource Planning Board, which advanced the necessity of a \u201csocially provided income.\u201d\n\nIn effect, FDR proposed to jumpstart the New Deal, a vital and inventive program of economic and social reform that necessarily stalled after the start of World War II. His \u201cEconomic Bill of Rights\u201d was bold in its contours and vague in its policy prescriptions, but it would effectively form the basis of the Democratic Party\u2019s aspirations for the better part of four decades.\n\nThis was certainly true of health care policy. In the 1940s, Senators Robert Wagner and James Murray and Congressman John Dingell Sr. introduced legislation that would have established a national program for hospital and medical insurance. It was stymied by a coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans, as was also the case with Truman\u2019s efforts after 1949 to achieve the same result. But it was central to the party\u2019s core ambition for many years after.\n\nOnly in the 1960s did Democrats abandon the concept of universal, single-payer health care and champion a narrower program of guaranteed hospital insurance and voluntary medical insurance for the elderly\u2014the program that we now know as Medicare. They didn\u2019t abandon universal coverage because they viewed it as too radical. Rather, they believed it was no longer necessary. After World War II, major employers began extending unprecedented benefits to workers, including annual cost-of-living adjustments to wages, defined benefits pensions and private health insurance. Given this reality, they turned their focus to a narrower subset of the population that, by definition, would not benefit from employer-based health programs: senior citizens.\n\nThe same trajectory was generally true of the party\u2019s commitment to ensuring that every family enjoyed an adequate income. Roosevelt\u2019s initial pledge seemed to augur a government-supported basic family wage. In 1946 the Democratic Congress passed\u2014and Truman signed\u2014the Employment Act, which codified the government\u2019s responsibility to \u201cfoster and promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare; conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those able, willing, and seeking to work; and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\u201d In its original form, the bill would have guaranteed all Americans remunerative work and required the government to create public-sector or private-sector jobs to meet this mandate. In this way, it would have met Roosevelt\u2019s quality of living standard for many families. Conservatives blocked that provision.\n\nBy the 1960s the American economy seemed so manifestly robust that an income or jobs guarantee no longer seemed necessary. During his tenure as assistant labor secretary in Lyndon Johnson\u2019s administration, Moynihan argued for a minimum family income program, to be enforced by means of a negative income tax, but his was a lone voice. Most liberals believed that if the poorest Americans had access to supplementary job training and education, they would be adequately positioned to capture the benefits of shared prosperity. Interestingly, the next major figure to take up the idea was no other than Richard Nixon, who as president attempted to overhaul the nation\u2019s welfare system by introducing a family income program. The idea stalled in Congress, with conservative Republicans opposing it as too generous, and liberal Democrats decrying it as too stingy.\n\nStill, even into the 1970s, Democrats continued to embrace the idea that government should in some way grant every American a good job and, thereby, income. In 1977, Democrats in Congress passed the Humphrey-Hawkins Act\u2014an ambitious proposal reminiscent of the Employment Act. Once again, conservatives watered down the bill such that it lost most of its force.\n\nAs was true of health care and income policy, Democrats for the better part of the postwar era supported broad access to education. Roosevelt\u2019s GI Bill of Rights extended free university and vocational education to over 16 million veterans of World War II. Millions more veterans of the Korean War would enjoy the same benefits. While liberals found it politically impossible to create a universal right to higher education, many historians generally argue that the GI Bill was meant to create a foundation for a broader guarantee, and indeed, spending on college grants and loans greatly expanded during and after Lyndon Johnson\u2019s administration.\n\nTo be sure, Democrats never came close to delivering on the promise that FDR established in 1944. It was always an aspirational goal\u2014a North Star that would compete with the gravitational pull of political reality. As well, a booming economy between the mid-1940s and mid-1970s demanded that liberals recalibrate their ambitions and propose a more patchwork system of support for people who had been left behind.\n\nIn fits and starts, from the 1970s onward, a new generation of Democratic leaders moved their party closer to the center. From the Watergate babies of the 1970s, many of whom rejected the party\u2019s traditional anti-monopoly stance and big-ticket spending agenda, to the Democratic Leadership Council\u2014whose crowning moment came with the election of Bill Clinton in 1992\u2014Democrats continued to pay homage to FDR even as they trained their sites on a more modest set of policy aspirations.\n\nIn this sense, it is true that many Democrats are moving back to their roots. And those roots lead to policies that commanded broad support\u2014and to leaders who commanded broad popularity\u2014in their day.\n\nIt\u2019s also ahistorical to decry such policies as \u201csocialist.\u201d To be sure, conservative critics have used the term for the better part of 80 years. In 1936, the chairman of the Republican National Committee warned that America was on a path to become \u201ca socialistic state honeycombed with waste and extravagance and ruled by a dictatorship that mocks the rights of the States and the liberty of the citizen.\u201d In 1952, during his campaign for the presidency, Dwight D. Eisenhower, a relative moderate in the Republican Party, denounced universal health care as \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d In 1961, while speaking on the circuit as a representative of General Electric, Ronald Reagan warned that a pared-down proposal to provide guaranteed hospital insurance for senior citizens constituted \u201ca short step to all the rest of socialism.\u201d \u201cIf you and I don\u2019t do this,\u201d he implored his audience, \u201cthen you and I may well spend our sunset years telling our children\u2019s children what it was once like in America when men were free.\u201d (Remembering Reagan\u2019s days as an FDR and Truman Democrat, a liberal skeptic asked him, \u201cHow much are they paying you for this shit?\u201d)\n\nBut this criticism ignores ways in which the Republican Party accommodated itself to much of the American welfare state. Republican votes were critical in passing and expanding the GI Bill, Medicare and Medicaid, and other social welfare policies\u2014well into the 2000s.\n\nMoreover, European policies that American conservatives regard as staples of Scandinavian-style socialism\u2014universal health care, government-provisioned child care, free or nearly free vocational and university education\u2014were in fact born of a postwar accommodation between conservative and social democratic parties throughout Western and Central Europe. Having endured a half century of intense warfare, as much the product of ideological as ethnic conflict, mainstream politicians and voters from across the political spectrum were eager to fashion a more stable social order.\n\nThe Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, the Christian Democratic Union in Germany, Christian Democrats in Italy, the Austrian People\u2019s Party, and the Popular Republican Movement in France are prime examples of center-right organizations that collaborated with socialist and centrist parties in establishing a welfare state that defined what historian Tony Jundt called the \u201c\u2018European way\u2019 of regulating social intercourse and inter-state relations.\u201d The contours of this welfare state varied from country to country, and to be sure, socialists, liberals and conservatives contested\u2014and continue to contest\u2014just how generous the state should be to its citizens. But by the turn of the 21st century, Jundt argued, the \u201cEuropean Way\u201d had become \u201ca beacon \u2026 and a global challenge to the United States and the competing appeal of the \u2018American way of life.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn fact, many scholars credit such policies with having forestalled the rise of extreme left-wing movements throughout postwar Europe. (It was precisely this idea that FDR had in mind several years earlier when he declared that he was \u201cfighting Communism, Huey Longism, Coughlinism, Townsendism\u201d\u2014references to highly redistributionist policies proposed by Long, Father Charles Coughlin and Dr. Francis Townsend\u2014to \u201csave our system, the capitalist system.\u201d)\n\nIn Europe, most of what we know today as the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cprogressive agenda\u201d is normative. It\u2019s the bare minimum of a social contract that enjoys wide support from conservatives, socialists and centrists alike.\n\n\n\n***\n\nSo why are Democrats dusting off the policies and political rhetoric of FDR\u2019s day? It could be because, in some ways, the United States more closely resembles the year 1932 than it does 1992, when Clinton pulled the party closer to the center. Income inequality has grown, fewer people enjoy employer-based health care, defined benefits pensions, a living wage or savings to cushions their families in times of bad luck or economic downturn.\n\nBut if the terms of debate are eerily familiar, our historical perspective is lacking. Almost alone among developed nations, we decry as \u201csocialist\u201d rights and protections that other people around the world regard as foundational to a well-functioning civil society\u2014rights that have long commanded support from across the political spectrum. Our center has drifted further right, leaving Americans to view the world through a uniquely skewed prism.\n\nWe can have a vigorous debate about \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a universal basic income and guaranteed college. We should have the debate. These might not be the right answers. But if we begin from the proposition that such ideas are alien to America\u2019s civic tradition\u2014that they are far outside the mainstream\u2014that they are a political nonstarter, we\u2019re not only constricting the terms of debate.

Thune is expected to move up in the party's leadership and Fischer is competing for the vice chairman slot to join the top ranks. | John Shinkle/POLITICO\n\nErnst is expected to face a tough reelection campaign in 2020, while Fischer is expected to win reelection handily on Tuesday. Ernst was elected in 2014 and is popular among other members of the \u201cbear den\u201d class that came in and flipped the Senate to Republicans. She also breaks with President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric on occasion. Fischer is closer with more senior senators, and her messaging is more consistently in line with Trump's and GOP leaders.\n\nThe opening is created by the Senate GOP\u2019s leadership term limits, which will cast Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) out of his No. 2 position after the past three terms. That move is expected to allow Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) to climb up to whip, John Barrasso of Wyoming to conference chair and Roy Blunt to policy committee chair. In turn, that would create an opening for the vice chair job, which is important for messaging and having a seat at the table with McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nThe Senate majority leader has been hoping to diversify his party\u2019s elected leadership for years, aware that the image of six white men in front of the cameras each week doesn\u2019t come across well, according to people close to him.\n\nThe top five Senate Republicans, plus the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, generally attend weekly press conferences. The last woman in GOP leadership was Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who stepped down from her role after losing her primary and didn\u2019t return after winning reelection as a write-in candidate.\n\nThe Senate as a whole has a record number of female senators, 23, with the possibility of adding more after Tuesday\u2019s midterms. But Republicans have lagged behind Democrats: This Congress, just six of the 51 GOP senators are women.\n\nThe Democratic Caucus is not expected to see as significant a shakeup in leadership, according to Democratic aides and senators, although Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) is being courted by senators to run the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nCortez Masto won a tough election campaign in 2016 to replace former Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and would join several other Democratic women in the party\u2019s leadership, including Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), who serve in the third- and fourth-ranking leadership slots, respectively.\n\nThe DSCC gig will be more plum than the NRSC job next cycle since Republicans will have roughly twice as many seats up for reelection. Democrats will be making a strong push to take back the chamber if they fall short on Tuesday, as expected, with vulnerable GOP seats in Arizona, Maine, Iowa, Colorado and North Carolina. Democrats will be mostly on offense in 2020, though the GOP is sure to try to oust Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama.\n\nSen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) is the favorite to chair the NRSC, although some K Street backers are still hoping for Mitt Romney, who is favored to win a Senate seat in Utah on Tuesday. Romney is expected to be a key fundraiser for Republicans, though strategists say he can accomplish that role without chairing the committee.", "People watch results come in at Hillary Clinton's election night event at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on Nov. 8, 2016, in New York City. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Elections Democrats traumatized by 2016 are having pre-midterms nightmares Despite forecasts of a Democratic House takeover, liberals grappling with 'PTSD' are braced for another surprise election disaster.\n\nOn the eve of the midterms, President Donald Trump\u2019s approval is falling, young voters are energized, and Republicans look poised to lose their House majority.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make Democrats nervous, miserable wrecks.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHaunted by memories of 2016, liberals around the country are riven with anxiety in the campaign\u2019s homestretch. They\u2019re suspicious of favorable polls and making election night contingency plans in case their worst fears come true. Some report literal nightmares about a Democratic wipeout.\n\n\u201cWe're kind of just in the bed-wetting phase now,\" said Democratic pollster John Anzalone, a Hillary Clinton campaign alumnus who spent election night 2016 in Clinton\u2019s Manhattan war room.\n\nTwo years later, even thinking about the prospect of a repeat of that night\u2019s letdown is still too much for many Democrats to bear.\n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d shouted Nadeam Elshami, a former chief of staff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, when asked about that possibility. To be fair, the possibility has literally haunted his dreams.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nElshami, who is now a Washington lobbyist, said that after staying up late reading campaign coverage and polls one recent night, he dreamed about watching tense House election results. His dream concluded with a Democratic House, but he doesn\u2019t consider that a prophecy, and he said the pre-election knot in his stomach is tighter this year than ever before.\n\nAnzalone said the shock of Donald Trump\u2019s upset victory, which was missed by most forecasts, still hangs over many in the party. \u201cThere\u2019s some PTSD,\u201d he said.\n\nThat is not an exaggeration. A study published last month in the Journal of American College Health found that one-quarter of college students experienced \u201cclinically significant\u201d symptoms of trauma from the 2016 election results.\n\nAt Vassar College in upstate New York, the college Democrats are moving their results-watching party to a new venue over concerns that revisiting the scene of their 2016 letdown would be too upsetting for some students, according to a member of the group. At Brown University in Rhode Island, the College Democrats have taken the same precaution after experiencing a \u201ccollective flashback\u201d to Trump\u2019s victory during a discussion of election night planning.\n\nA September AP/MTV poll found that 61 percent of Democrats ages 15 to 34 reported feeling anxious over the midterms, up 22 percentage points from July.\n\nBut pre-midterm stress syndrome isn\u2019t afflicting only young people: A YouGov survey released Friday found that Democrats are 50 percent more likely than Republicans to report that they are \u201ceating their feelings\u201d ahead of the midterms. Other recent polling has registered high levels of stress among Democrats ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nFor many traumatized Democrats, heading into Tuesday feels like flying again after surviving a plane crash. Some say the stakes feel even higher than in 2016: It was one thing for Trump to win in an electoral fluke, despite losing the popular vote, when he was still a political newcomer. It will be downright terrifying, they say, if Americans can\u2019t place a check on him after two years of his megalomaniacal rule.\n\n\"I'm old enough to remember when The New York Times gave Hillary Clinton an 85 percent chance of winning on election night and to have been traumatized by the New York Times election needle,\" said Ezra Levin, who co-founded the Resistance organization Indivisible with his wife, Leah, after their election night gathering turned into the worst house party of their lives.\n\nMany liberals consider it bad luck \u2014 or, worse, an excuse for apathy \u2014 to embrace talk of big Democratic gains on Tuesday.\n\nWhen House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi predicted to \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert last week that Democrats \u201cwill win\u201d the House, the liberal comedian worried she might be jinxing the outcome.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that,\u201d Colbert replied. \u201cDo you want to say that on Hillary\u2019s fireworks barge that she canceled?\u201d (Clinton\u2019s campaign had prepared a fireworks display to celebrate her expected 2016 win.)\n\nPerhaps reflecting a once-bitten, twice-shy mentality, national Democratic leaders had not announced election night plans as of press time. In 2006, the last time they waged a midterm campaign against an unpopular incumbent, they rang in their landslide victory with an all-night, open bar bash at which over 1,000 revelers spread across two ballrooms at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill.\n\nDemocrats still have plenty of worst-case-scenarios to fret over. Though the House map favors them, control of the chamber comes down to roughly 30 toss-up races. Assuming the polls are not systematically flawed, Republicans would have to win roughly twice as many of those toss-ups as Democrats to maintain control of the chamber, a feat that is unlikely but far from impossible.\n\nYoung and minority voters \u2014 whose turnout tends to drop significantly in midterm years \u2014 are showing greater than normal enthusiasm this cycle, but if they end up turning out in typical midterm numbers, Democrats could fall short.\n\nMeanwhile, polling shows bleak Democratic odds for wrenching the Senate away from Republicans, meaning that just two dozen to three dozen House races will decide whether Democrats have any real legislative and oversight power for the next two years.\n\nAnother important wild card is the group of new and irregular voters who turned out for Trump in 2016 \u2014 a group whose behavior pollsters have found hard to predict. It remains unclear how many will vote without Trump\u2019s name on the ballot, but the president has courted them hard, and a strong turnout could deliver a better-than-expected showing for Republicans.\n\nDemocrats are also agonizing over exotic threats they\u2019ve never had to worry about before \u2014 including the prospect of undetected foreign interference. A recent Pew survey found that Democrats are far more stressed than Republicans about the threat of voting systems being hacked.\n\nAll that anxiety does have a silver lining for the left: motivation.\n\n\u201cThere's this feeling that we're losing until we win,\" said Levin, who has visited with activists campaigning across the country. \u201cNone of them I talked to is confident and planning on a win,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery one of them doesn't trust the polls, doesn't trust that this is in the bag.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats like these, haunted by \u201cthe ghosts of 2016,\u201d Anzalone predicted that \u201cTuesday will be an exorcism.\u201d\n\nUnless it\u2019s not, right?\n\n\"That made me want to say, \u2018Fuck you,\u2019\u201d Anzalone said. \u201cBut yes. Yes.\u201d", "President Donald Trump drummed up support for former Rep. Ron DeSantis' gubernatorial campaign and Gov.

Bill Nelson.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIn Rick\u2019s case, he\u2019s going against somebody that\u2019s falling asleep,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd in Ron\u2019s case, he\u2019s going against somebody who\u2019s got a lot of energy, but he runs one of the worst \u2014 one of the biggest problem cities anywhere in the country. He\u2019s not doing his job. You don\u2019t want to have him running Florida, that I can tell you.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Trump talked about how Democrats across the country should expect a tough fight, because of the recent success of Republicans, including himself.\n\n\u201cIn the history of our country, today, more Americans are working than ever before in the history of our country. That\u2019s a good sound bite,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was just saying, that\u2019s awfully tough to beat somebody when I\u2019m debating one of the far-left candidates that the Democrats will produce \u2014 when you have two of them running against our two friends,\u201d he added. \u201cBut can you imagine in the debate? We have the most successful economy ever. What are they going to say? We have the best job numbers ever. What are they going to say?

It won\u2019t be one. It\u2019ll be three,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the person plus the media, against me. So that makes it a little tougher. That makes it a little bit tougher.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember the way they treated Hillary [Clinton],\u201d he posited, referencing the 2016 presidential debates. \u201c\u2018Oh Madame Secretary. Oh, what did you have for breakfast, Madame Secretary? Did you enjoy it? And as far as you, Mr. Trump, bah bah bah.\u2019 No, we have three people on that stage.\u201d\n\nHe also hit at the media \u2014 a common theme of his rally run, so far.\n\n\u201cCould the cameras please pan out and show this crowd? It would be really nice,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWould you do that? You know, they never like to do that, folks. They never like to do that. Could you pan out? See, they won\u2019t turn that camera. They don\u2019t want to turn the camera. They never do, unless there\u2019s a little problem \u2014 in which case that camera bends in 15 different directions, right? That camera can bend and turn. They never show the crowd, but people hear the crowd.\u201d\n\nAnd returning to the original reason behind the eight-state, 11-rally effort, Trump called out several Democrats currently in office.\n\n\u201cBut if Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer \u2014 you know Cryin\u2019 Chuck \u2014 Nancy Pelosi or the legendary genius Maxine Waters,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they take power, then they will try to wipe away all that we\u2019ve done and at the same time double and triple and quadruple your taxes.

The day after the Aug. 28 primary election, on a different Fox show, DeSantis called Gillum \u201carticulate\u201d and said voters shouldn\u2019t \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing him. Like Bossie, DeSantis was rebuked on air by a Fox News personality, but the former three-term congressman, who is white, refused to apologize because he said he did nothing wrong and his comment was not about race.\n\nDuring an Oct. 21 debate, Gillum directly addressed the \u201cmonkey this up\u201d remark in a racial context after the moderator asked DeSantis about the comments.\n\n\u201cHe has only continued in the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can to the color of my skin,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019ve been black all of my life. So far as I know, I will die black.\u201d\n\nDeSantis has fiercely pushed back against any accusations he is racist, offering up his time as a Navy JAG officer as evidence.\n\n\u201cWhen I was down-range in Iraq, we worked as a team regardless of race,\u201d DeSantis said during the second and final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 24.\n\nThe moderator at that debate asked DeSantis about the fact he has spoken at conferences organized by conservative David Horowitz, who has in the past sparked controversy for statements like \u201cthe country\u2019s only serious race war is against whites.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know every single statement someone makes?\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bow down to the altar of political correctness, I\u2019m not going to let the media smear me.\u201d\n\nGillum\u2019s response drew loud reaction from the audience, and later went viral.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI\u2019m saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201d\n\nMarc Caputo contributed to this report.", "Both Sen.

Dean Heller in a fiercely contested race, said, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you some real good news: We added 4,000 Democratic votes to our lead here in Clark County, I think pushing us up around the 38,000 firewall.\u201d By late Friday, that number climbed past 40,000.\n\nIn Arizona\u2019s hotly contested Senate race \u2014 a must-win for Democrats who are hoping to limit Trump\u2019s hopes for GOP gains \u2014 Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) rallied her party Saturday morning by touting its \u201cgangbusters\u201d performance in early voting. Data on early voting released by the state indicates that Democrats have narrowed, although not eliminated, Republicans\u2019 historically wide advantage.\n\nSinema also returned to her party\u2019s bread and butter as Trump digs in on immigration: health care. She\u2019s repeatedly reminded voters that her GOP opponent, Rep. Martha McSally, supported a House Obamacare repeal bill that would have gutted protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n\n\u201cI have been fighting so hard\u201d to preserve popular elements of Obamacare, Sinema told backers at a Phoenix community center, \u201cbut they are at risk\u201d given the repeated GOP attempts to chip away at the health care law.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waves to the crowd as he arrives for a campaign rally at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport on Saturday, Nov. 3, 2018, in Belgrade, Montana. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo\n\nBut Democratic and Republican strategists alike entered Saturday uncertain about the implications of the early vote.\n\n\u201cIs there going to be a blue wave? Yes. Is there going to be a red wave? Yes. What does that mean? I don\u2019t know,\" said Mike Madrid, a longtime Republican consultant in California.\n\nStill, Madrid acknowledged the possibility that Democrats surpass expectations on Tuesday \u2014 picking up seats in the Senate or gaining a larger than expected majority in the House \u2014 with dramatic implications for the long-term health of the GOP.\n\nIf Democrats can prevail in suburban, Republican-held House districts that went for Hillary Clinton in 2016, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a really tectonic shift in American politics, because it means there\u2019s a hemorrhaging in the Republican base. \u2026 If they know what\u2019s at stake and they say, \u2018Fine, give Nancy Pelosi [the speaker\u2019s] gavel, that\u2019s a huge break in the coalition.\u201d\n\nPelosi (D-Calif.) has already declared victory, saying on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert this week that \u201cWe will win.\u201d But many Democrats remain uneasy, in part because of flawed projections that left them dumbfounded following Trump\u2019s election in 2016.\n\nTom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and Democratic megadonor, urged Democratic activists on Friday to \u201csprint through the tape,\u201d while Andrew Feldman, a Democratic strategist in Washington, said Democrats \u201ccan\u2019t take the foot off the gas.\u201d\n\nJust days before the election, both parties sought to gain an edge in critical races by boosting third-party candidates. In Indiana, the state Democratic Party ran Facebook ads aimed at conservative voters attacking Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun for his past as a registered Democrat and calling the libertarian candidate the \u201ctrue anti-tax conservative.\u201d And the Arizona Republican Party sent mailers tying Green Party candidate Angela Green to Sen. Bernie Sanders, calling the two \u201ctoo extreme\u201d for Arizona in hopes of pushing some liberal voters toward her rather than Sinema. (Green dropped out of the race on Tuesday and endorsed Sinema.)\n\nTrump blasted Sinema\u2019s immigration record in a Saturday tweet endorsing McSally that came soon after both candidates rallied fans at Arizona State University\u2019s homecoming game. Trump claimed that Sinema \u201cdoesn\u2019t even care about\u201d border security, aiming to chip at her appeal on an issue in which she\u2019s hewed close to the center.\n\nRepublicans received an election-eve gift Friday with the release of a report showing 250,000 jobs gained in October. But Trump, ignoring the pleas of Republicans to focus on the economy in his midterm messaging, said at a rally Friday that \u201csometimes it\u2019s not as exciting to talk about the economy \u2026 because we have a lot of other things to talk about.\u201d\n\nInstead, in an effort to turn out base voters, Trump has kept his closing argument largely focused on immigration, warning Friday of \u201cillegal aliens trying to flood into our country on your dollar.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration this week approved sending more than 5,000 U.S. troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to stop a caravan of Central American asylum seekers heading toward the United States. And Trump said he wants to eliminate birthright citizenship, a move most legal scholars say would be impossible without a constitutional amendment, but that Trump says he thinks is possible with an executive order.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams embrace during a campaign rally at Morehouse College on Friday, Nov. 2, 2018, in Atlanta. | John Bazemore/AP Photo\n\nAt a rally in Montana on Saturday for Republican Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, Trump touted the recent economic news while attacking Democratic Sen. Jon Tester over his opposition to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cThis election will decide whether we build on the extraordinary prosperity that we've achieved or whether we let the radical Democrats take control of Congress and take a giant wrecking ball to our economy and to the future of our nation,\u201d Trump said, before pivoting back to immigration later in the appearance.\n\nDemocrats' long odds of capturing the Senate were reflected in New Jersey, where incumbent Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez is locked in a closer-than-expected race with Republican Bob Hugin.\n\nIn a brief speech to about 100 Republicans in front of the Burlington County GOP headquarters in Mount Holly, Hugin assailed Menendez for the incumbent's corruption trial last year \u2014 which ended in a mistrial \u2014 but never mentioned Trump, who is unpopular in the state.\n\nMenendez \"has to go,\" said Hugin, who has loaned his campaign $36 million and called the race a dead heat. \"It's time for him to go.\"\n\nDemocrats, while lambasting Trump on immigration, are focusing heavily on health care \u2014 and specifically on Republicans\u2019 efforts to rescind Obamacare, and with it the law's provisions protecting people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nCampaigning alongside Rosen in Nevada, Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat who is likely to run for president in 2020, said, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, anyone who wants to vote to get rid of our health care should be voted out of office.\u201d And later that day in Georgia, where Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp are locked in a close race for governor, former President Barack Obama lashed out at Republicans on the issue.\n\n\"Not only will they not own up to what they have done,\" Obama said. \"Suddenly they are saying that they're the ones to protect people with preexisting conditions. I want everyone to pay attention to this. They have literally been doing the opposite. It's like calling black, white. It requires some kind of gumption.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on Saturday morning in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District, one of the tightest and most closely watched contests in the country, Democrat Amy McGrath kicked off a daylong series of mini-pep rallies with canvassers. Speaking to two dozen volunteers inside a small campaign office in Georgetown, McGrath, a retired Marine fighter pilot, mentioned her service in the context of their own.\n\n\u201cYou are here serving the country,\u201d she said. \u201cBy knocking on 30, 40, 50 doors, you are serving the country \u2014 and I would argue you are saving the country.\u201d\n\nSome 20 miles south, in Lexington, Republicans were doing work of their own. At the local headquarters of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the powerful outside group aligned with House GOP leadership, waves of door-knockers were being dispatched to blanket precincts in the 6th District. Meanwhile, a team of 10 volunteers \u2014 high school and college students\u2014 worked the phones, dialing voters and asking whether they were voting for McGrath or Republican incumbent Andy Barr.\n\nIn generic congressional polls, Democrats\u2019 advantage has remained relatively steady, at about 7.5 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average.\n\nBut Paul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster, said Trump\u2019s inability to \u201csell the economy\u201d combined with his anti-immigration pronouncements and reaction to the mail-bomb scare and Pittsburgh synagogue shooting \u201cat least temporarily seems to have swung the thing at least a couple of points in our direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it possible that the still-enthusiastic Trump voter will still turn out and balance out the intensely negative anti-Trump voter? Yeah, that\u2019s possible,\" Maslin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s more likely that he\u2019s never recovered from the damage he did to himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have a 2 or 3 percent swing,\u201d Maslin said. \u201cAnd if it happens in enough places in the end, among independents and women and suburban voters who just say, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019 \u2026 If that happens in many places, then this could be a very good, a very good political night.\u201d\n\nStill, Maslin said, \u201cI still think we\u2019re in a mess on Nov. 7,\u201d with a fractured political climate that \u201cis not going to be any prettier.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may have a very good night next Tuesday, and so what?\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer any real question other than Trump\u2019s failed pretty spectacularly in his first two years, and we\u2019ll see what he does as a result.\u201d\n\nSiders reported from Nevada and California, Schor from Arizona, Shepard from New Jersey, Alberta from Kentucky, Strauss from Georgia, Marinucci from California and Arkin from Washington, D.C.", "Nati Harnik/AP Photo Politics The 2018 Race That Could Settle the Democrats\u2019 Civil War In a Nebraska swing district, Kara Eastman is running a Brooklyn-style campaign. Can it possibly work?\n\nOMAHA \u2014 There\u2019s a general election playbook for how to run as a Democrat in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District, and in many other congressional districts like it. Run to the middle. Sand down the ideological edges. Get distance from the national party.\n\nKara Eastman has tossed it out the window.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAfter she shocked national Democrats by winning her primary in May, there was no pivot to the center, no cautious equivocating. In the runup to November, she even brought in some of the most liberal members of Congress to stump with her\u2014a tactic that in past years would have been seen as ruinous.\n\n\u201cThe district predominantly, the way it\u2019s been competed for over the last decades\u2014and I have worked directly or indirectly on the 2nd District in every cycle going back to 2000\u2014almost everybody will move toward the center,\u201d says Jim Rogers, a veteran of Nebraska politics who served as campaign manager for former Rep. Brad Ashford, the last Democrat to hold this seat. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s been unique about Kara is that even after the primary, she veered more left.\u201d\n\nThe success or failure of Eastman\u2019s unorthodox strategy\u2014she believes it\u2019s \u201cfutile\u201d to try to convert Republicans\u2014will be a key barometer for assessing which faction of the Democratic Party was right about the 2018 midterms: the cautious centrists who urged their party to hew toward safe, traditional positions, or the impassioned leftists who argue that unapologetic progressivism is the way to win.\n\nTruth be told, Eastman\u2019s policy platform is a little jarring to many voters in this district, a Republican-controlled seat that covers the largely Democratic city of Omaha and the largely GOP suburbs surrounding it. For starters, the expensive centerpiece of her campaign is \"Medicare for all,\" the linchpin of Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign. She calls for tuition-free college, another Sanders staple, increased gun control, a $15 minimum wage and no restrictions on abortion. In other words, an agenda that\u2019s always been assumed to be too politically radioactive for competitive congressional districts like Nebraska\u2019s 2nd.\n\nHer positions read like a liberal wish list, not entirely different from the ones espoused by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a darling of the left whose message of unapologetic, pedal-to-the-metal progressivism powered her to an upset primary victory in a New York City district in June.\n\nLike Ocasio-Cortez, Eastman won national notice in May for defying the Democratic Party establishment and pulling off one of the biggest upsets of the primary election season. But there\u2019s one glaring difference: On Election Day, Ocasio-Cortez will likely cruise to victory in an overwhelmingly Democratic, East Coast district where Hillary Clinton won four of every five votes. Eastman, one the other hand, faces a Republican incumbent in a Republican-leaning district where Donald Trump won roughly one of every two votes.\n\nThat distinction makes Eastman one of the most important and revealing congressional candidates of 2018. Replacing one Democrat with another in a solidly blue seat in New York doesn\u2019t change the balance of power. But replacing a conservative Republican with an unapologetic, full-spectrum Democrat in Nebraska suddenly alters the equation, moving the Democratic Party one step closer to a more durable, broader-based and progressive-minded House majority.\n\nJust as important, an Eastman victory would provide a validation of what the left has long insisted about how the Democratic Party needs to approach elections. The party, the argument goes, has been consigned to a minority in the House for much of the past quarter-century\u2014and has withered at the statehouse level in many states\u2014in no small part because it has been plagued by uninspiring, milquetoast centrists who fail to embrace bold, liberal positions that voters would respond to if given the chance. If Democrats made a habit of running authentically liberal candidates who speak from the heart, such as Eastman, progressives contend, they could win almost anywhere.\n\nYet if Eastman loses, her campaign becomes Exhibit A in the Democratic establishment\u2019s case against the party\u2019s truest believers. It would be held up as evidence that centrist-oriented candidates are the best fit in swing districts because, if you can\u2019t win with a talented, well-funded progressive in a year marked by historic gains for female candidates and strong Democratic tailwinds, when exactly can you win?\n\n***\n\nThe first thing you notice when you walk into Kara Eastman\u2019s strip mall campaign headquarters is a big wall poster that reads \u201cProgressives are winning everywhere!\u201d The Progressive Change Campaign Committee poster, which features a national map of the year\u2019s top progressive candidates for the House, includes photos of both Eastman and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe storefront, the nerve center of a campaign that\u2019s renowned locally for its frenzied door-knocking and potent ground game, is humming with activity and noise on the early October afternoon when I stop in. Above a table filled with office supplies is a whimsical, hand-drawn sign that says, \u201cDepartment of Magical Outreach.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s there that I meet with Eastman, who\u2019s immediately recognizable from her tortoiseshell glasses. She doesn\u2019t yet have the practiced artificiality of a seasoned pol. She\u2019s direct and earnest, able to project warmth while maintaining distance.\n\nShe\u2019s 46, but her age isn\u2019t immediately obvious to everyone. During canvassing later that afternoon, an older voter will ask her how old she is, and he expresses relief when she tells him she\u2019ll turn 47 on Election Day. He thought she might be in her mid-20s, and wasn\u2019t comfortable voting for someone that young.\n\nAt her campaign headquarters, Eastman tells me her political origin story, which begins in the Midwest. She was born in Evanston, Illinois, grew up in Chicago and went to college in California. I later learn she was in a band at the time, the name of which\u2014Pieces of Fuck\u2014suggests she didn\u2019t foresee a future in elected politics.\n\nTwelve years ago, she moved to Omaha when her husband, Scott, took a job as an associate professor in the history department at Creighton University. With a master's degree in social work and extensive experience in the nonprofit sector, Eastman founded a local nonprofit, the Omaha Healthy Kids Alliance, a lead poisoning prevention organization. In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, the party\u2019s equivalent of the Myers-Briggs test, Eastman backed Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders. When I ask her about the seeming incongruity, given her campaign strategy, she concedes Sanders\u2019 views more closely align with her own.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m a] big Bernie Sanders fan, and I also really think Hillary Clinton is amazing. I loved a lot of the policy positions that Sanders put out, and, at the time, some of them seemed a little untenable,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor me, and I\u2019ve said this before and I think some people get a little weirded out about it, but I have a 17-year-old daughter, and I wanted her to have a female president, somebody who had the right experience and somebody who was an amazing person.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Eastman had one run for local public office under her belt, a successful bid for the Metropolitan Community College Board in 2014. The shock of the 2016 presidential election outcome helped spark the notion of running for something bigger, and doing it without holding back.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think people like me got elected. I\u2019m a social worker. I don\u2019t have a political science background,\u201d Eastman says. \u201cWhen Trump got elected, it was like, \u2018Oh, I guess anyone can get elected.\u2019\u201d The frequent comparisons to Ocasio-Cortez, who is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, have forced Eastman to make clear to voters there\u2019s a difference between running for Congress as a social worker, which she is doing, and running as a socialist. Eastman points, too, to policy differences between herself and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not calling to abolish ICE. I\u2019m not calling for a universal basic income. She does identify as a democratic socialist. I don\u2019t,\u201d Eastman says. \u201cI\u2019m not endorsed by the democratic socialists. I never said I was a socialist. Just the fact that you want everybody to have health care doesn't make you a socialist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even necessarily see it as a bad word. It\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s not an actual fact,\u201d she says. \u201cMy favorite thing to say is, \u2018I think you mean social worker, not socialist.\u2019\u201d\n\n***\n\nOnly three Democrats have held Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District since 1951. None of them lasted very long.\n\nInstead, since midcentury, there\u2019s been a long succession of Republicans, most of them with deep local connections. They tended to be born here, went to high school here or graduated from law school here\u2014more than a few from Creighton, the Catholic college that is one of the city\u2019s largest employers.\n\nThey were mostly conservatives\u2014usually steady, Bob Taft-wing types. One of them was billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s dad, Howard, who served at midcentury as a kind of proto-Ron Paul, a libertarian conservative with a noninterventionist streak.\n\nThe line of congressmen produced by Omaha since then obscured the fact that this was no conservative stronghold. Occasionally, in presidential election years when a surge of Democrats showed up, voters might even send a Democrat to Congress, where he would hold the seat for a brief period of time.\n\nBrad Ashford was one of those Democrats. In 2014, Ashford became one of just two Democrats across the country to oust a Republican congressman. Incumbent Republican Rep. Lee Terry had overstayed his welcome\u2014he barely won his primary months earlier\u2014and Ashford was just the right candidate to take him down in what was otherwise a great Republican year nationally.\n\nAn Omaha native, Ashford was a respected figure who served two different stints in Nebraska\u2019s nonpartisan unicameral legislature. He was a Democrat, but just barely. The giveaway? In the course of running for various offices during his career, he had run as a Democrat, as a Republican, and then as an independent before registering again as a Democrat.\n\nAshford would end up losing his seat narrowly to Republican Don Bacon in 2016 after just a single term. At a gracious and emotional press conference the day after, despite the hard fought campaign, he was asked whether he would seek a rematch in two years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d have to figure out which party I\u2019m in,\u201d he joked.\n\nAt one time, a throwaway line like that would have gone unnoticed. Nebraska Democrats are fatalistic about their minority status in this overwhelmingly conservative state, and it\u2019s led to a kind of gallows humor.\n\n\u201cRepublicans have been very successful in defining Democrats culturally and socially in Nebraska,\u201d explains Barry Rubin, a former executive director of the state Democratic Party. \"They\u2019ve defined us as snowflakey, that we want to raise taxes and redistribute wealth.\u201d\n\nEastman is among a new generation of loud-and-proud Democrats who aren\u2019t troubled by the weight of that collective history. But they are very troubled by candidates who can\u2019t say with absolute certainty which side they are on.\n\nBefore deciding to run, she consulted with Ashford himself. They were already acquainted\u2014Eastman had volunteered and phone-banked for Ashford\u2019s campaign; the ex-congressman\u2019s niece and Eastman\u2019s daughter were best friends. In the months after his defeat, Eastman and her husband went to dinner with Ashford and his wife to talk it over.\n\n\u201cHe was the first person I went to when I was making the decision to do this,\u201d she says.\n\nAshford would later decide to run again for the seat himself, announcing his bid months after Eastman dove in with the expectation that he wouldn\u2019t. The state and national parties greeted the former congressman with open arms.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the best fundraiser, and his voting record wasn\u2019t ideal\u2014in his lone term, he had one of the more conservative voting records among congressional Democrats\u2014but he was, after all, the first Democrat in more than 20 years to crack the code and win the seat.\n\nIn January 2018, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s House campaign arm, made it clear where the national party stood. It essentially gave Ashford the party imprimatur by adding him to its \u201cRed to Blue\u201d list, a program designed to highlight and provide resources to top candidates.\n\nThe decision to put a thumb on the scale for Ashford was entirely reasonable, if you apply traditional political yardsticks. Eastman had raised just $200,000 by the end of 2017, an uninspiring fundraising performance that suggested she\u2019d never be able to go toe-to-toe with a well-funded Republican incumbent. Her unreserved embrace of progressive causes was another red flag\u2014no Democrat that liberal had ever won the seat. On the face of it, Ashford looked to be the best shot Democrats had.\n\nBut Eastman had a few advantages that party officials hadn\u2019t figured in. It turns out she was a natural, with a rare ability to convey her positions in personal, human terms. At the heart of her signature \"Medicare for All\" proposal was a story about her mother\u2019s battle with cancer and a pill she needed to take that cost $2,500. Her immigration stance is influenced by a friend who had been deported, and by her brother, whose job in the federal court system required a daily report on kids being separated from their families. On guns, her position is colored by concerns about her high-school-age daughter.\n\nEastman also assembled a campaign apparatus that operated with a missionary zeal. There were no hired guns here. It was mainly a family-and-friends affair, along with volunteers drawn to the clarity of her message. Her husband, Scott, handled policy. A colleague from the nonprofit sector, Dave Pantos, served as finance director.\n\n\u201cOne of the things voters need right now is to feel that sense of authenticity from a candidate, and that includes all the people around you,\u201d Eastman says.\n\nBut, she admits, \u201cit wasn\u2019t like professionals were at my door saying, \u2018Hire me.\u2019\u201d\n\nHer campaign did anything and everything it could to capture attention\u2014and make it fun for supporters. To meet fundraising benchmarks, Pantos took pies to the face in Facebook Live videos. Eastman did political \"pop-up\" visits, at which people could visit with her in coffee shops or bars. There were weekly postcard parties to write to voters, and \"Kara-oke\" events, at which supporters could hear the candidate sing.\n\nAgainst Ashford, a political veteran who venerated bipartisanship and the politics of moderation, there couldn\u2019t have been a sharper contrast. The two Democrats were different by almost every measure\u2014ideological crispness, age, gender, place of birth, work experience\u2014and one that especially mattered to many younger voters who had come of age during or after the Obama era. Unlike Ashford, Eastman was an unabashed liberal, a Democrat, and she owned it.\n\n\u201cSo often, Democrats here run as Republicans, and they almost run away from the party affiliation,\u201d says state Sen. Burke Harr, who represents Central Omaha. \u201cThey\u2019re never a proud Democrat. She ran as a proud Democrat who stands with the ideals of the national party, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a candidate do that since \u2026 2006.\u201d\n\nIn one television ad that ran during the primary, Eastman made it clearer than ever. \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing Democrats don\u2019t have a backbone,\u201d she said in a direct-to-camera spot. \u201cThat we don\u2019t stand for anything. That changes now.\u201d\n\nOver coffee one morning at Jimmy\u2019s Egg at 80th and Dodge, a local franchise breakfast haunt, Harr explains that among the affluent, educated professionals he represents, it was impossible to miss the energy Eastman\u2019s message was creating. He saw it in local parades and in the proliferation of Eastman yard signs. A lot of the younger voters, he says, viewed Ashford as no different than a Republican.\n\n\u201cBrad didn\u2019t toe the party line all the time, so they wanted someone where they can say, \u2018Hey, if we\u2019re going to go down, let\u2019s go down swinging, and let\u2019s bring in our person that we want,\u2019\u201d said Harr, who backed Ashford in the primary. \u201cAnd I heard that over and over.\u201d\n\nEastman would go on to defeat Ashford by 3 percentage points, powered by a surge of first-time female voters. Ashford\u2019s campaign took Eastman\u2019s challenge seriously, expected heavy turnout and still was surprised by the number of Democrats who showed up. Turnout doubled over 2014, the most recent midterm election primary.\n\nWhen Pantos, Eastman\u2019s finance director, recounts to me his recollection of primary election night, he chokes up with emotion and has to stop for a moment to collect himself.\n\n***\n\nEastman\u2019s brain trust does have a theory of the case. Over lunch, Crystal Rhoades, the Democratic Party chairman of Omaha\u2019s Douglas County, explained the political logic to me. An early Eastman supporter, Rhoades has been something of a local lightning rod for her attempts to move the party in a more leftward direction. To her way of thinking, the old formula of trying to hold the party base and pick off Republicans and independents is a fool\u2019s errand, a flawed approach that all but guarantees defeat.\n\nShe says she came to that conclusion after a deep dive into the data. A former community organizer who first met Eastman in the nonprofit world, Rhoades started out as a political hobbyist crunching numbers with her husband\u2014prior precinct results, turnout, voter registration figures, campaign spending, door knocks, any data they could get their hands on.\n\nTheir overarching conclusion? Better to concentrate on turning out more Democrats by exciting the base than moving to the center in the hopes of winning over wayward Republicans. The idea is to get as many low-propensity voters as possible to cast ballots\u2014particularly those who had voted in past presidential elections, but not midterms\u2014and then roll it up among the affluent white liberals in Dundee, the millennials of Benson, African-Americans in North Omaha and Hispanics in South Omaha.\n\n\u201cWe realized it was a turnout problem. Democrats just didn\u2019t participate in the numbers needed to win,\u201d says Rhoades, whose husband, Ben Onkka, serves as Eastman\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to win votes from Republicans is crazy. We\u2019re not. We\u2019re not trying to change their minds. It\u2019s much easier to get someone to the polls than to change the minds of true believers.\u201d\n\nOf course, identifying new Democratic voters and turning them out was only part of the challenge. The party also had a candidate problem, in Rhoades\u2019 estimation.\n\n\u201cDemocrats would stay home because they didn\u2019t have real Democrats to vote for,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve never tried it this way where we picked a progressive woman and said, \u2018Let\u2019s see how this works.\u2019 We have always picked a pro-life, Catholic, male lawyer. This is very much the mindset of the traditional candidates, the usual suspects, what people call the establishment.\u201d\n\nThere is a precedent for this approach, and it came during the 2008 presidential campaign. Back then, the Obama campaign took a long look at the electoral map and realized that the size of the 2nd District\u2019s latent Democratic base made it the exhaust port of Nebraska\u2019s GOP Death Star. In other words, the weak spot\u2014and with the right targeted approach and great intel, Dems could take it out.\n\nWhile the state was typically among the nation\u2019s most reliably Republican in presidential races, its unusual system of allocating electoral votes by congressional district, rather than distributing them on a statewide, winner-take-all basis, offered a unique opportunity for the right Democrat.\n\nThe Obama campaign then targeted the 2nd with a vigorous grassroots campaign, opened three field offices there, and unexpectedly picked off a single electoral vote for the then-Illinois senator.\n\n\u201cIt was clear [John] McCain would carry two of Nebraska's three districts comfortably,\u201d Obama campaign manager David Plouffe would later write in his book, The Audacity to Win. \u201cBut we thought we could steal the 2nd District, around Omaha, where our organization was strong.\u201d\n\nOmaha, he wrote, was \u201cmy personal favorite target.\u201d\n\nThe Obama tide wasn\u2019t enough to oust Terry, the incumbent Republican congressman at the time, but it did serve notice to the national parties that the district wasn\u2019t a lost cause. The right liberal candidate, under the right conditions, could pull it off.\n\nTo members of the Democratic establishment here, and to many campaign pros, Rhoades is preaching a suicidal doctrine. Yet here\u2019s the interesting thing: While nearly all of them think Eastman will fall short on Election Day, almost none are certain of it anymore\u2014not in this election year, not with Donald Trump in the White House and not with Eastman\u2019s robust field organization.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a battle between people like me and people like Kara over what kind of candidates can win. They say Republican-lite doesn\u2019t win. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re right,\u201d says Rubin. Then come the caveats: \u201cShe\u2019s making a game of it for sure. Her grassroots game is very strong and impressive.\u201d\n\n***\n\nCampaign tactics aside, Eastman\u2019s bigger problem might be her opponent.\n\nIndeed, if you were in the business of recruiting candidates, you could hardly find one better suited for the 2nd District than Don Bacon, the current congressman. A former commander of Offutt Air Force Base, a major area employer located just outside the city, Bacon is a mainstream conservative, neither a hard-edged ideologue nor a loudmouthed bomb-thrower.\n\nHe\u2019s approachable, garrulous and here, nearly 1,200 miles away from Washington, voters would be hard-pressed to envision this freshman congressman as a big part of the mess in D.C. His ads reinforce that image, suggesting he\u2019s down to earth and doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously.\n\nIn his successful 2016 run, one spot, titled \u201cEverybody Loves Bacon,\u201d was shot in a grocery store. This year, in one of his ads the congressman fries bacon in a modest kitchen. \u201cEveryone in Nebraska knows that when you turn up the heat, bacon gets even better,\u201d he says to the camera.\n\nI met the congressman at his campaign headquarters, where he tells me his parents were Barry Goldwater volunteers. At 13, he was reading Human Events and National Review. He describes himself as a Ronald Reagan kid who cried when Gerald Ford beat Reagan for the GOP nomination at the 1976 convention.\n\nBacon\u2019s offices seem more like a doctor\u2019s waiting room than a messy hive of political activity. The Optimist\u2019s Creed is stationed in a bookcase next to a book about Thomas Jefferson. The shelves are filled with bacon-related products, ranging from bacon salsa to bacon marmalade to bacon ketchup. Portraits of Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill hang on the walls beyond the front office, along with memorabilia from his service in the Air Force.\n\nWhen asked about Eastman, Bacon notes that her views are a bit exotic for Nebraska. He admits to being a little unsettled at first after her primary victory\u2014he said he didn\u2019t sleep well that night because he had been preparing to run against Ashford, the centrist he knocked off two years earlier. But, he says, the sharp contrast has provided an obvious opening.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Brooklyn or New York,\u201d says Bacon. \u201cThe Bernie Sanders wing doesn\u2019t play well here. You don\u2019t see a lot of democratic socialists here.\u201d\n\nNational Republican groups have bombarded the district with ads to reinforce that message.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a clear choice for Congress between a liberal radical and a patriot who served as the commander of Offutt Air Base,\u201d the narrator says in one radio ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC connected to House GOP leadership. \u201cKara Eastman\u2019s been a liberal radical since her school days. In college, Eastman studied to be a sex therapist and was a singer in a band called Pieces of [bleep]. While Eastman was dropping F-bombs, Don Bacon was serving in the Air Force and preparing to lead at Offutt.\u201d\n\nUnlike many of his House colleagues this year, Bacon has taken nothing for granted, aware of what he calls \u201cthe energy factor\u201d on the other side. Eastman unexpectedly turned out to be a formidable fundraiser, raising more than $2.35 million through mid-October, yet Bacon hauled in $2.48 million over the same period. He says he knows that the first reelect is always the hardest.\n\nAs he sees it, the Eastman campaign has given him an opportunity by focusing so intently on maximizing the Democratic vote.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even trying to reach the middle, or moderate Republicans,\u201d Bacon says. \u201cI need to make sure the Republicans turn out. I found that our base is as energized as theirs. So it\u2019s the independent guys that are going to drive this. If I can get them to come out for me, I think game over. If I can get more moderate Democrats, like some of these unions that are traditionally Democrat, she\u2019s not only going to have to get more Bernie Sanders voters, she\u2019s going to have to make up for the ones she\u2019s losing. So my goal is to make this an insurmountable mountain for her to climb.\u201d\n\nIn late September, the New York Times live-polled the district and found Bacon had a 51 percent to 42 percent lead, with 7 percent undecided. More recent polling also shows Bacon with a single-digit advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the polls aren\u2019t adequately capturing the grassroots energy generated by Eastman\u2019s campaign, or the composition of the Nov. 6 electorate that her campaign is playing an important role in shaping. Or maybe too many voters view her as a \u201cdangerous radical,\u201d as the Republican ads portray her.\n\nWin or lose, the fight won\u2019t end on Election Day. An Eastman win would set off a wave of excitement on the left and command national attention, but to alter conventional political thinking, progressives would need to marshal convincing evidence that Eastman\u2019s experience is replicable, and not a fluke victory engineered under optimal political conditions for Democratic candidates of all stripes. It may be that she\u2019ll need to win reelection before the lesson of a victory truly sinks in.\n\nAn Eastman defeat won\u2019t immediately settle anything either. Because the race has been so closely watched on the left, a loss will set off a serious battle for control of the narrative. Party officials and officials will view the results as a blown opportunity, an example of the progressive left\u2019s reach outstripping its grasp. They\u2019ll point out that she had adequate financial resources and a strong national environment in which to run and still fell short. What better evidence is there, they\u2019ll say, that the Eastman campaign was built around faulty assumptions?\n\n\u201cAre there enough repressed progressives to put you over the top of very reliable Republicans?\u201d says Rogers. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a great case study for political scientists for years to see what happens after this election on the basis of that strategy.\u201d", "Rep.

Bob Menendez as his Republican opponent poured $36 million into his campaign. | AP Photo New Jersey Democrats sound alarm over Menendez race\n\nNew Jersey Democrats are growing increasingly worried that Sen. Bob Menendez could lose his seat next week in an outcome that would undercut the party\u2019s effort to take back the Senate.\n\nDemocratic strategists working on races across the state said in interviews that they have seen a remarkable decline in support for Menendez as his Republican opponent \u2014 former pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin \u2014 poured $36 million of his own wealth into his campaign. Hugin has used much of the money to run a seemingly endless stream of negative campaign ads. Even as public opinion polls show the senator up by double digits, some insiders say a post-summer boost, hoped for by team Menendez, never arrived.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHugin\u2019s relentless attacks, which took a dark turn the last three weeks, have chipped away at the scandal-scarred senator\u2019s standing with suburban voters and women, some strategists said. Menendez, running in a state that has 900,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, is now struggling to hold on to areas where he should have massive support, some said. In several competitive congressional districts, internal polls show votes for Menendez running far behind support for a generic Democrat, one strategist said.\n\nAs Menendez\u2019s aides insists they\u2019re \u201cconfident\u201d he\u2019ll win, some allies are openly admitting things may not turn out as planned, saying the massive advertising campaign on the other side has been difficult to overcome.\n\n\u201cI think the race is a toss-up,\u201d Loretta Weinberg, the Democratic majority leader of the state Senate, said in an interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s a fight, and we\u2019re all in to continue fighting up until 8 p.m. on Election Day.\u201d\n\nNow, with three days until the election, Menendez is swinging wildly at his opponent, linking him to President Donald Trump, former Republican Gov. Chris Christie and even suggesting \u2014 falsely and without evidence \u2014 that Hugin was fired under questionable circumstances by investment bank JPMorgan nearly two decades ago. He\u2019s furiously working to get out his base, cranking up the urban turnout machine with the help of Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and others.\n\nAll of that is playing out as national Democrats are dumping some $7 million into a state that hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972.\n\nA year after Menendez successfully weathered a high-profile federal corruption trial, New Jersey\u2019s senior senator finds himself again in another battle for political survival.\n\nHugin \u2014 the former CEO of biotech company Celgene \u2014 has raised just shy of $39 million, with all but $3 million coming from his own pocket. He gave his campaign $8.5 million in just the last two weeks. A super PAC with ties to Christie has spent more than $5 million on ads to help Hugin.\n\nMenendez, who has to rely on donors, has raised just short of $12 million. He\u2019s received a boost from two super PACs that have spent a combined $4.4 million to help him, and the Senate Majority PAC \u2014 a super PAC tied to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer \u2014 has spent about $7 million on the race.\n\nEvery public opinion poll has shown Menendez in the lead. And, to be sure, many Democrats think the senator will be just fine. But only in recent weeks has Hugin aired two commercials that dredge up old, anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations that Menendez solicited underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.\n\nOne of the ads, \u201cHer,\u201d shows a woman holding a baby girl as images of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein flash on a TV screen. A female narrator describes the accusation and, as an image of Menendez appears on a tablet computer with the baby in the background, declares, \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to explain a vote for him, to her.\u201d\n\nThe weaponization of the allegation in the final weeks before the election has made it difficult for Menendez to fight back against the attack, which he labeled the \u201cdesperate\u201d act of a \u201cslimeball\u201d and a \u201cliar.\u201d\n\nMonths of ads had reminded voters about the trial in which Menendez was accused of carrying out official favors for a Florida eye doctor \u2014 now a convicted Medicare fraudster \u2014 in exchange for campaign cash, private jet flights and lavish Dominican vacations.\n\nSome Democratic operatives say there\u2019s no doubt the attacks have worked. One strategist said Menendez spent the month of October \u201ctrying to hold on and just trying to survive.\u201d\n\nThe operatives, who are involved in the state Democratic politics, all spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the state of the race in the days leading up to the Nov. 6 election and so as to not anger Mendendez.\n\nAnother operative said Hugin\u2019s final swings at Menendez are an effort to \u201cchop his legs out from under him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re running a very, very, very good campaign, and Menendez seems to be just hoping this is over,\u201d the second Democrat said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a significant chance he could lose.\u201d\n\nMuch of the Democratic hand-wringing is based on internal polls that people who are privy to them describe as showing a narrowing race. Internal polls conducted in at least four congressional districts where Democrats are hoping to pick up seats \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 11th \u2014 have shown Menendez with support that\u2019s more than 10 percent lower than that given a \u201cgeneric\u201d Democrat, according to one strategist who called the numbers \u201cbrutal.\u201d\n\nPublic polls haven\u2019t reflected that. While a Stockton University poll released in early October showed Menendez leading Hugin by just 2 points, a Monmouth University poll showed Menendez leading by 9. A new Stockton poll released Friday, based on a sample that was younger and less white than the earlier survey, showed Menendez up 12 points. Other public polls have been somewhere in between.\n\nStill, there\u2019s clear distaste for Menendez among many of those surveyed, with just 23 percent in the latest Stockton poll saying they have a favorable view of him and 44 percent having an unfavorable view. Such feelings were expressed in the June primary when Menendez\u2019s unfunded and virtually unknown Democratic challenger, Lisa McCormick, got 38 percent of the vote and won several rural counties.\n\nOne problem for Menendez is that some of the largest concentrations of Democratic voters are located in congressional districts that don\u2019t have competitive House races. Those include Newark, Jersey City, Paterson and Elizabeth \u2014 the state\u2019s largest cities.\n\nWithout a competitive House race to worry about, there\u2019s a fear some voters may stay home. If that happens at the same time voters in the state\u2019s competitive, suburban congressional districts decide they just can\u2019t vote for Menendez, it could be game over for the Democrat, some say.\n\n\u201cIf the big cities don\u2019t show up in real numbers, that\u2019s how this thing is lost,\u201d the first strategist said.\n\nWhile Mendendez\u2019s staff say many events happening now were planned out months ago, it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a focus on driving the urban voters to the polls. On Oct. 30, Menendez held a rally at an African Methodist Episcopal Church in New Brunswick and another rally with seniors in East Orange, a small city near Newark where 97 percent of the population is black or Hispanic.\n\nBooker, the former mayor of Newark and a likely 2020 presidential candidate, attended both events and delivered a rousing sermon on the need to vote, quoting Martin Luther King, invoking former President Barack Obama and blaming voters who didn\u2019t turn out for Christie being elected governor in the state.\n\nDemocrats say Menendez is absolutely focused on driving up turnout numbers in such Democratic strongholds, as opposed to focusing end-of-campaign events on the state\u2019s unaffiliated voters, who number nearly 2.4 million \u2014 more than all Democrats statewide.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing to his base. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the game plan. It\u2019s not that complex,\u201d said LeRoy Jones, the Democratic chairman of Essex County, where Newark and East Orange are located. \u201cYou go to your heart. You go to your core.\u201d\n\nJones believe Menendez will win. So do the senator\u2019s campaign aides, who also say his focus on driving out the base hasn\u2019t come at the expense of efforts to target suburban voters through policy-focused ads and events.\n\nMenendez is scheduled to campaign with Gov. Phil Murphy, Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver and Booker in the closing days of the race and plans to hold public events in five cities and four suburbs over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe feel very confident in the senator\u2019s position right now,\u201d Steve Sandberg, a spokesman for the campaign, said. \u201cWe believe that New Jersey voters, when they go to the polls, are ultimately going to judge Bob Menendez on his entire record of delivering for this state and improving the lives of its residents.\u201d\n\nBut Menendez also seems to be throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks and, in one instance, has turned to a Trump-like tactic to stir up controversy. He has repeatedly tweeted over the last week about Hugin\u2019s departure from JPMorgan in 1999.\n\n\u201cBob Hugin touts his record for taking a job at Celgene\u2014a failing company with only 6 weeks of cash left,\u201d Menendez tweeted on Oct. 28. \u201cIsn\u2019t it strange that @BobHugin, with a lucrative job at J.P. Morgan, suddenly left to take a job that no one else wanted? Why did you really leave? #Questions4Hugin #NJSen.\u201d\n\nBut Hugin\u2019s campaign provided a disclosure form, filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, that shows Hugin left as part of a \u201cjob restructuring.\u201d The company would be required to disclose if Hugin had been fired or had any securities violations.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Bob Menendez \u2014 a 25-year incumbent \u2014 has spent the last few days talking about this with just 5 days to go tells you everything you need to know about how close this race is,\u201d Nick Iacovella, a spokesman for the Hugin campaign, said in a statement.", "Lobbyists are fanning out across the country this weekend and taking vacation Monday and Tuesday to knock on doors for favored candidates. | Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images ELECTIONS Lobbyists hit campaign trail to help old bosses, earn 'a little bit of currency' Knocking on doors is one way to strengthen a bond with elected officials.

Some in the industry also remain close to old bosses on Capitol Hill or just want to get out of Washington and dabble in campaigning for a few days.\n\nSome lobbyists are heading to competitive states and districts to help members of Congress who are facing close races.

Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) who\u2019s now a lobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations for clients including AT&T, Pfizer, Verizon and Wells Fargo, said she is heading to New Jersey this weekend with her husband, who\u2019s also a lobbyist. The couple will help turn out voters for Menendez, who\u2019s facing a stronger-than-expected challenge from pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin. Ivan Zapien, a former Menendez former chief of staff who\u2019s now a lobbyist at Hogan Lovells for Walmart and other clients, is heading to New Jersey, too.\n\n\u201cIt just felt like a natural thing to go back and help him out,\u201d said Willhite, who said she volunteered on Menendez\u2019s last two campaigns as well.\n\nJustin Rzepka, a lobbyist at BGR Group who represents clients including the Motion Picture Association of America and Samsung, is heading to Nevada to help GOP Sen. Dean Heller, who\u2019s facing the toughest reelection fight of any Senate Republican. Brian McGuire, a former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who decamped for K Street last year, is going to Tennessee to help GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn campaign for an open Senate seat targeted by Democrats. And Izzy Klein, a lobbyist and former aide to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) before he became majority leader, will head to New Jersey to campaign for Mikie Sherrill, who\u2019s running for an open House seat.\n\nLobbyists are well-known as avid fundraisers for members of Congress, but raising money becomes much less crucial in the final days of the campaign than making sure voters get to the polls. So, lobbyists who want to help have to head beyond the Beltway and into battleground states and districts.\n\nLobbyists privately admit that helping a member of Congress in the final days of the campaign can help maintain a valuable relationship.\n\n\u201cAt heart, people who come downtown still are tied to their old jobs\u201d on Capitol Hill, said one Democratic lobbyist. Campaigning with an old boss \u201cdoes give you a little bit of currency \u2014 it refreshes you a little bit.\u201d\n\nOthers came to Washington because they wanted to work in politics, and they now see campaigning as a way to stay involved \u2014 if only for a few days each cycle.\n\nOne longtime Republican lobbyist, who said half his firm would be out campaigning in the final days of the race, likened lobbyists\u2019 motivation to hit the campaign trail to the reason people go to Red Sox or Yankees games in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cYou want to be there on election night for the win,\u201d the Republican lobbyist said. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nLongtime senators and congressmen often have former aides working on K Street who form a sort of extended family \u2014 and like a family, members try to help each other out when one of them is under threat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say you\u2019re expected to go back [and campaign], but it\u2019s your family,\u201d the Republican lobbyist said. \u201cYou help your family.\u201d\n\nLobbyists can be particularly eager to hit the campaign trail when one of their party\u2019s leaders is in trouble. When McConnell faced a tough reelection fight in 2014, lobbyists who consider themselves part of the \u201cMc-family\u201d descended on Kentucky sporting \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d T-shirts to help get out the vote.\n\nOn occasion, lobbyists go to greater lengths to aid their favorite candidates. Susie Wiles, a top lobbyist at Ballard Partners who managed President Donald Trump\u2019s Florida campaign in 2016, took a leave of absence in September to head up GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis\u2019 gubernatorial campaign in Florida. Brian Ballard, the firm\u2019s president, has been closely involved in fundraising for DeSantis and Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who\u2019s running for Senate.\n\nPaul Weiss, a lobbyist with Prime Policy Group, sent an email Wednesday to friends and family urging them to vote for Menendez, even though he\u2019s never worked for the senator.\n\n\u201cSenator Menendez is sharp and industrious,\u201d Weiss wrote. \u201cHe makes me even more proud to be from the great State of New Jersey! He deserves your support. Spread the word. Participate now through next Tuesday. Vote.\u201d\n\nWhile lobbyists often head to their home states to campaign if there\u2019s a competitive race, others pick a destination closer to home.\n\nTwo lobbyists, Jesse Barba of Cassidy & Associates and John Sonsalla of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, started Electing a Democratic Generation after the 2016 election to encourage millennials on K Street and elsewhere to support Democratic candidates.\n\nThe group has been running a get-out-the-vote program for the past few weeks in House districts within easy driving distance of Washington. Barba and Sonsalla estimate their volunteers have knocked on more than 7,000 doors in support of Andy Kim, who\u2019s challenging Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.); Abigail Spanberger, who\u2019s running against Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.); and Susan Wild, who\u2019s running for an open seat in Pennsylvania.\n\nMore than two dozen K Street types have signed up to help, according to the group, including some who work at top lobbying firms such as Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Holland & Knight and in the Washington offices of companies such as Amazon, Geico, IBM and National Grid.\n\nKevin Brennan, a lobbyist at Faegre Baker Daniels who once worked for Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), said his old boss\u2019 campaign was going well enough that he\u2019d decided to go to Virginia to volunteer for Spanberger instead.\n\n\u201cI did for his last re-election and was planning to go out this weekend too,\u201d Brennan wrote in an email to POLITICO. \u201cBut since he looks good, I\u2019m taking my 10-year-old twins to canvass for Abigail Spanberger.\u201d\n\nOne longtime lobbyist was succinct in an email about why the Spanberger race appears to be particularly popular with Democratic lobbyists: \u201cAttractive candidate, serious chance to win, did not require a flight.\u201d\n\n", "Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said that he hopes his campaign will demonstrate that Democrats can beat Republicans in the Trump mold. | Steve Helber/AP Photo Elections 'America's Dad' campaigns for redemption Up for reelection to the Senate, Tim Kaine wants to set an example for how to beat Trump.\n\nTim Kaine is on a mission to put his 2016 nightmare behind him \u2014 and show a way forward for the Democratic Party.\n\nUp for reelection to a second Senate term, Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 vice presidential nominee is trouncing his opponent in almost every poll. Yet Kaine is running like he\u2019s dead even, determined to stamp out a Republican whom he\u2019s personally offended by, and to relegate the Clinton-Kaine debacle two years ago to a mere blip in his career.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKaine also wants to make a statement about the correct course for the Democrats as they debate how to take on President Donald Trump in 2020. The 60-year-old Virginia senator told POLITICO that he hopes his campaign will demonstrate that Democrats can beat Republicans in the Trump mold \u2014 his opponent, Corey Stewart, once boasted he was \u201cTrump before Trump was Trump\u201d \u2014 with a message of going high when opponents go low.\n\n\u201cLet them be the dividers, we\u2019ll be the uniters,\u201d Kaine said in a brief interview. \u201cWe should be the positive, optimistic, and forward-looking party.\u201d\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe Virginia Senate race, technically a swing-state contest, has proved to be anything but competitive. Stewart's close relationships with some prominent white nationalists and campaign to preserve Confederate monuments have offended a swath of Republicans in the state. The national GOP is not committing resources to the contest. Trump has declined to campaign for Stewart despite enthusiastically endorsing on Twitter in June. And the Republican candidate has raised just $2.4 million, barely over a tenth of Kaine\u2019s haul.\n\nThe white flag that Stewart and the GOP have seemingly raised has made Kaine only charge harder. He\u2019s barnstorming the state, running ads, stumping for other Virginia Democrats, and intending to spend every cent of the money he\u2019s raised in-state \u2014 all while welcoming the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d meme of 2016.\n\n\u201cI think he just feels like Virginia and Virginians are so much better than the rhetoric coming out of Corey Stewart,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who has known Kaine since law school. \u201cHe wants to show the rest of the country that Virginians don\u2019t abide that.\u201d\n\nSusan Swecker, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said Kaine has been \u201claser-like focused\u201d on the race, hitting every corner of the state ever since the 2016 election loss. It was the first time Kaine has ever been on the losing side of an election.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t just start with Corey Stewart as the nominee, it began right after 2016,\u201d said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very competitive person and I think he wanted to ensure that he never lost another race\u2026It was a well laid out plan to not leave a stone unturned and to win by as big a margin as possible.\u201d\n\nKaine has run an upbeat, come-together, almost sentimental campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are going to send a message of hope this November,\u201d Kaine has been telling crowds. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to accept divisiveness or bitterness or anger,\u201d he said at a recent debate.\n\nHis campaign made \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d placards, an embrace of the meme that took hold on Twitter and among late night comedians during the 2016 campaign depicting the senator as a mild-mannered, lovably corny dad. Or \u201cA human sweater vest,\u201d as HBO\u2019s John Oliver memorably put it. (The campaign even spliced together a video of the top \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad\u201d moments.)\n\nThe familiar notes of disagreeing without being disagreeable have pervaded the campaign. Kaine regularly boasts about the 20 bills he wrote or co-sponsored that Trump signed. His closing ad released this week promises that he\u2019ll \u201cwork with anyone\u201d and echoes his campaign slogan: \u201cA Virginia that works for all.\u201d In case anyone missed the point, his PAC is also called \u2018Common Ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe statement he wants to make is far more powerful when he shows that Virginians are making it than if he tells Twitter that Donald Trump is a bad president,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a veteran of Virginia politics and Clinton\u2019s deputy national press secretary in 2016. \u201cHe would have wanted to beat any Republican nominee, but running against a mini-Trump carries a bigger burden because it\u2019s such the antithesis of who he is.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats say Kaine is still shell-shocked by the 2016 race. Warner recalled that the night before the election, Kaine had been talking confidently about what he\u2019d be doing as vice president.\n\n\u201cThe last two cycles haven\u2019t gone as predicted so you can\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d said Warner.\n\nOn the trail, Kaine has been gently distancing himself from the Clinton effort and suggesting that they didn\u2019t take on Trump correctly.\n\n\u201cI'd be getting talking points from the Clinton campaign every day,\u201d he told the Washington Post last week. \u201cAnd it would be, \u2018Here's what we\u2019re going to say about Trump today.\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018No, here's what I'm going to say about Hillary today. And then I'll say that thing about Trump.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cthere wasn't enough being on the front foot. And you\u2019ve got to be on the front foot.\"\n\nClinton, for her part, has not donated to Kaine's reelection, even as her PAC Onward Together has given to many House candidates. Clinton's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n", "Robert S. Mueller III did it. He really did it. He honored to the letter the Department of Justice guidelines that direct prosecutors and other to avoid actions that might influence the outcome of an election.\n\nDoing his work at Quiet Car levels for the past six weeks, the most raucous news to radiate from his investigation into collaboration between the Trump campaign and the Russians has been about its relative noiselessness. Without opening a tab to Google it, tell me the last time something big broke. Manafort\u2019s guilty plea feels like it happened last year. I\u2019ll bet you can\u2019t even remember who got indicted last. Not that the special prosecutor went into hibernation, as CNN noted. His office did its sleuthing on padded feet, conducting at least nine sit-downs with convicted felon Paul Manafort in recent weeks; conversing with President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team; and scrutinizing the connections between Trump devotee Roger Stone and WikiLeaks, which dumped the stolen Democratic emails late in the campaign. Did self-avowed dirty trickster Stone (more on him, later) and WikiLeaks coordinate an October surprise in the release of the hacked Podesta emails?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe press has filled the quiet period with speculations of what will come next. With the baffles taken off his investigation, how high will Mueller turn up the volume? Will he complete and file his report on Russian meddling to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein? Will Rosenstein still have a job by the time the report is complete, or will he have been swept out by the president along with Attorney General Jeff Sessions? Will Trump have Mueller sacked, too? Or will Mueller issue new indictments in the case? Will he taper off his investigation? Will he go to court in an attempt to force the president to testify? Has the president already been subpoenaed? Will he amp his investigation up with an excursion into previously unexplored realms of corruption illuminated by the insights of Manafort and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who has so completely turned on his former boss he is encouraging people to vote Democratic? Finally, if Mueller finds no evidence of collusion, might he instead allege obstruction of justice by the president? No criminal indictment has ever been leveled at a sitting president, and many legal scholars say he can\u2019t be charged. But such an indictment could rally Democrats to impeachment.\n\nThis week, at the request of legal scholars and activists, the National Archive unsealed the \u201cWatergate Road Map,\u201d the report independent prosecutor Leon Jaworski sent to Congress detailing the evidence collected against President Richard Nixon. The facts-only road map didn\u2019t recommend prosecution or claim that Nixon had committed an impeachable offense. The petition for its release asserted that the road map could provide \u201ca key precedent for assessing the appropriate framework for Special Counsel Mueller to report to Congress any findings of potentially unlawful conduct by President Trump.\u201d\n\nGiven all the variables at work, we\u2019ll need more than an ancient road map to make a precise prognostication of which way Mueller will go. Complicating the divination is the likelihood the Democratic Party will take the House of Representatives and ignite new investigations of its own. As my Politico colleague Darren Samuelsohn wrote this week, the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee have a list of 70 people, organizations and companies they say the Republican-led committee ignored during its investigation and a 98-page document on outstanding lines of inquiry.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues that is of great concern to me is: Were the Russians laundering money through the Trump Organization,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), a favorite to head the Intelligence Committee in a Democratic Congress. \u201cThat to me would be far more powerful kompromat than any video.\u201d\n\nIf Schiff pilots that committee, Trump might start waxing nostalgic about the treatment he got from Mueller\u2019s allegedly angry, allegedly Democratic investigators compared to the genuinely angry committee Democrats working him over. As the Republican inquiry into Benghazi attests, congressional investigations are often conducted as politics by other means, especially in times of divided government. The procedural niceties and Department of Justice guidelines that steer an investigation like Mueller\u2019s hardly exist on Capitol Hill. The point of most Hill investigations is not to determine guilt or innocence but to score political touchdowns. Unlike legal investigations, where professionalism deters prosecutors from leaking to the press, congressional investigations gush like a garden hose sprinkler to reporters eager to amplify the findings and accusations to the voting public.\n\nLord knows the Democrats have enough kindling to start an investigative bonfire. In addition to suspected Russian efforts to help the Trump campaign, evidence points to assistance from Middle Eastern figures. As Chris Geidner writes in BuzzFeed, top Trump stalwarts, including Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Steve Bannon and Erik Prince all made curious political contacts in the Middle East worth investigating. \u201cLongtime Trump friend and billionaire investor Tom Barrack also has met with the special counsel\u2019s office, although it is not clear whether those conversations led to any further lines of inquiry for the office,\u201d Geidner continues.\n\nThe only safe bet to make for the post-quiet period would be Mueller\u2019s indictment of Roger Stone, something Stone himself has been predicting since at least August. He has claimed that he was probably the unnamed Donald Trump associate who was described in an earlier Mueller indictment as communicating with Russian hacker \u201cGuccifer 2.0.\u201d Stone, who once famously predicted on Twitter on August 21, 2016, that \u201cit will soon be Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel,\u201d has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThis week, Stone\u2019s long-running denial that he had ever discussed WikiLeaks with Trump campaign officials unraveled as the New York Times reported on an email exchange between Stone and Steve Bannon in which Stone \u201cpresented himself to Trump campaign officials ... as a conduit of inside information from WikiLeaks, Russia\u2019s chosen repository for documents hacked from Democratic computers.\u201d\n\nStone took petulant umbrage in the pages of the Daily Caller, denying any advance knowledge of WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. \u201cWhat I am guilty of is using publicly available information and a solid tip to bluff, posture, hype and punk Democrats on Twitter. This is called \u2018politics.\u2019 It\u2019s not illegal,\u201d Stone wrote.\n\nGood luck, Roger, but it looks like it will soon be your time in the barrel.\n\n******\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Amtrak have a Noisy Car?

The segregated schools, the no-go theaters, the colored-only water fountains. The white supremacist siege of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama, where Martin Luther King, Jr., was trapped inside, and Harbison was, too. The white folks telling his mother she couldn\u2019t vote unless she could answer how many beans were in a jar, or how wet water was.\n\nHarbison is now a Democratic state senator from Georgia, and the Deep South has changed radically in his 72 years on its soil. Sometimes, though, he reflects on how it hasn\u2019t changed\u2014like when he reflects on the high-profile race for governor pitting Stacey Abrams, a progressive African-American Democrat who used to run a voting rights nonprofit, against Brian Kemp, the conservative white Republican secretary of state who is mired in multiple voting rights controversies. Harbison is rooting for Abrams to become the first black woman governor of any American state, and Kemp\u2019s efforts to purge voter rolls and challenge voter registrations in ways that disproportionately affect minorities bring back painful memories of the bad old days. \u201cIt\u2019s a different time, but it feels like the same game plan,\u201d Harbison told me after an Abrams rally at Columbus State University.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGeorgia is at the epicenter of a national movement for stricter voting rules in Republican-controlled states, and its battles over the ballot have become a national story about race and power in the South. But while Harbison is concerned that Republicans may be disenfranchising some black voters, perhaps even enough to swing a too-close-to-call governor\u2019s race to Kemp, he thinks far more black voters disenfranchise themselves, sitting out elections they suspect are pre-determined to ratify the white power structure\u2019s status quo. He tells his constituents, especially young ones, about the blood that\u2019s been spilled to secure their right to vote, but many of them don\u2019t believe their vote will count.\n\n\u201cWe need a fully operational electorate if we want things to change,\u201d he says. \u201cToo many people say: \u2018Aw, what\u2019s the use, it\u2019s gonna be what it\u2019s gonna be.\u2019\u201d\n\nJim Crow no longer rules Georgia, and despite media coverage that has made it sound like Bull Connor is patrolling the polls, the vast majority of Georgians who want to cast a vote this fall will be able to do so. The state has expansive online registration, early voting, and vote-by-mail; the bean-counting days are over. Kemp did spark a national uproar by suspending the registrations of 53,000 Georgians, mostly African-Americans, through an \u201cexact match\u201d system that flags even minor typos and missing hyphens, but those voters can still cast legal ballots if they show up to the polls with proper ID\u2014and on Friday, a federal judge ordered Kemp to make sure that 3,000 of them flagged as non-citizens can vote if they prove their citizenship. Kemp has also culled more than 10 percent of the names on Georgia\u2019s rolls since 2016, some through a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d rule that eliminates voters who don\u2019t show up at the polls or respond to mailings for seven years. But Democrats have launched the largest voter protection operation in state history, and so far fears that hundreds of thousands of voters would be blocked at the polls seem wildly overblown.\n\nEven Abrams, who constantly denounces Kemp as an architect of voter suppression, \u201cdoing everything in his power to rig the game in his favor,\u201d makes it clear that she\u2019s even more concerned about self-suppression in a climate of fear and confusion. \u201cWe lose elections not because people can\u2019t vote,\u201d she said at a rally last week at Valdosta State College, \u201cbut because they don\u2019t know why they should vote.\u201d\n\nSo far, minority turnout is shattering records for a midterm election, which is both a political problem for Kemp and a talking point in his defense against allegations of disenfranchisement. But Georgia has been at the vanguard of a new national push to create barriers to voting, a push justified by warnings of rampant voter fraud that seems to exist only in Republican imaginations. It was one of the first two states to try to adopt strict voter ID rules in 2006, and it has been among the most aggressive of the 24 states that have tightened access to the ballot in recent years. Ever since the Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, rolling back federal scrutiny of election rules in seven southern states with histories of discrimination, the trend in Georgia has been toward fewer polling places and more rigorous demands for documentation before ballots can be cast. Kemp even pursued investigations of several activist groups that register minority voters, including the New Georgia Project founded by Abrams herself.\n\nKemp is not the only Republican secretary of state presiding over his own bid for higher office. Kris Kobach, the driving force behind President Donald Trump\u2019s short-lived voter fraud commission that failed to produce evidence of voter fraud, is running for governor of Kansas, while Jon Husted, who also aggressively purged his state\u2019s voter rolls, is running for lieutenant governor of Ohio. But the combination of Kemp\u2019s tight race against an outspoken African American voting activist along with a continuing flurry of lawsuits and other controversies have turned him into the symbolic leader of the Republican crusade for voting restrictions. Just this week, another federal judge sided with civil rights groups over Kemp to stop county officials from rejecting mail-in ballots with mismatched signatures, ruling they should err on the side of counting every vote. A recent report on the state\u2019s restrictions by New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice was titled: What\u2019s the Matter with Georgia?\n\nKemp insists that nothing is the matter with Georgia. He dismisses the furor over the franchise as \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201ca farce,\u201d \u201ca fabricated story\u201d designed to fire up Abrams voters. He says the overwhelming majority of purged registrations were people who moved, died, or never existed; he told me one voter who didn\u2019t make the cut gave his name as \u201cJesus\u201d and address as \u201cHeaven Street.\u201d He said it\u2019s ironic that Abrams is blaming him for the problems with mismatched registrations when \u201cher own group couldn\u2019t get people to fill out forms correctly,\u201d and he emphasizes that county officials run the actual election. He\u2019s a laconic guy with an easy drawl, but he\u2019s furious that national reporters keep parachuting into Georgia to raise alarms about voter suppression and racial discrimination. He prefers to focus on his staunch check-every-box conservatism, and his opponent\u2019s unusually liberal views for a statewide candidate in the South on issues like guns, taxes and immigration\u2014as well as her support from out-of-state donors like Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer.\n\n\u201cThis race isn\u2019t about black and white,\u201d he told me after a speech at a barbecue joint in rural Nahunta. \u201cIt\u2019s about who\u2019s going to put Georgia first, versus billionaire socialists from New York and California.\u201d\n\nAcademic studies have suggested that the direct impact of vote suppression on vote totals tends to be modest, which may well be the case again here. But like interference in elections by foreign governments, a problem doesn\u2019t have to swing an election to be a problem. Yes, anyone with a state-issued ID should be able to vote in Georgia, but it\u2019s also true that low-income people of color are less likely to have drivers licenses or other forms of ID. And one thing that was clear after following Abrams and Kemp on dueling bus tours through rural southern Georgia was that no matter how many voters encounter problems at the polls, this race is very much about black and white. The predominantly black voters who came to see Abrams and the almost exclusively white voters who watched Kemp seemed to live in two parallel realities, one where black Georgians lament systemic injustice, the other where white Georgians believe race relations are fine. It\u2019s no accident that Oprah Winfrey and former President Barack Obama were just in Georgia to help Abrams rally her base, or that Vice President Mike Pence just stumped with Kemp, with Trump coming to help on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThis is a battle for the soul of our state,\u201d Kemp tells his supporters.\n\n\u201cWe can change Georgia and the South,\u201d Abrams tells hers.\n\nIt feels like William Faulkner, was half right: The past is never dead, even if it actually is past.\n\n\n\n***\n\nGwendolyn Thompson was in sixth grade when she integrated her elementary school in the town of Thomaston, too young to understand the hatred that was hurled at her every day. Why did white kids call her \u201cdarky\u201d and worse? Why did they hug the opposite wall when she walked down the hall, as if she had a virulent disease? Thompson went on to build a good life in the Atlanta suburbs, raising three kids and adjudicating disability cases, enjoying the diversity of life in the home of Coca-Cola, CNN and the civil rights movement. But she would never forget the sting of racism, and she would always wonder what her older white colleagues were thinking but not saying about racial issues. When she returned to rural Thomaston a few years ago to care for her sick father, she found that her worst bully at school was running (unsuccessfully, it turned out) for probate judge. \u201cIt was such a kick in the gut,\u201d Thompson recalls. \u201cHe used to spit in my food.\u201d\n\nI met Thompson in the pews of a packed Methodist church in her hometown in Georgia\u2019s black belt, shortly before Abrams showed up to preach early voting. To Thompson, Abrams represents a glimmer of hope for a state where racism has outlived Jim Crow; she recounted how her son, an electrical engineer who was his firm\u2019s first black employee, was assigned to train a younger and less qualified white man to be his boss. She sees voter suppression as the logical response of a ruling class in a fast-changing red state where minorities are on track to become the majority in the 2020s.\n\n\u201cThey see us advancing, and they\u2019re panicking,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to keep their feet on our necks.\u201d\n\nAt a series of Abrams rallies in south Georgia, where crowds ranged from 60 percent to 90 percent black, her supporters repeatedly cited racial gaps in education, income, and policing as the facts of their daily lives. In the city of Albany, an early cradle of the civil rights movement, a 41-year-old social worker named Dedrick Thomas told me the wrenching advice he recently gave his teenage son: \u201cIf a cop says \u2018Nigger, bark like a dog,\u2019 you bark like a dog. I need you home alive.\u201d In the agricultural town of Cuthbert in Randolph County, where local officials recently tried to shut down seven of nine polling places before backing down after a political firestorm, a 66-year-old retired teacher named Sandra Willis said she\u2019s waited all her life for a governor who looked like her and cared about her.\n\n\u201cA lot of white folks still think we should be picking cotton,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid for us to get a piece of what they\u2019ve had for years.\u201d\n\nAbrams joked in Cuthbert that she doesn\u2019t look like a typical Georgia politician: \u201cI\u2019m a little taller.\u201d But she\u2019s serious about her message of a new Georgia, with a government that looks out for everyone rather than a favored few, promoting the dynamism and tolerance that\u2019s already associated with Atlanta while expanding Medicaid and investing in public education for ordinary people throughout the state. She talks about how she and her five siblings grew up poor, eating orange government cheese, and how she later racked up debt supporting her ailing parents. She tells a story about her first visit to the governor\u2019s mansion for a ceremony honoring high school valedictorians, when a security guard blocked her at the gate and told her it was a private event. \u201cI don\u2019t remember meeting the governor,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember that man telling me I didn\u2019t belong.\u201d\n\nAbrams portrays Kemp as an electoral version of that security guard, using his power to obstruct access to the levers of power. \u201cHe believes voter suppression is his path to victory,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s not new to it, but he\u2019s true to it.\u201d She uses the issue to rally her base, framing it as a test of whether Georgia will be a symbol of the Old or New South, urging crowds to fight back by voting. \u201cMr. Kemp knows how to count,\u201d she told me in Albany. \u201cHe knows this is a changing state, and I\u2019m building a multi-racial, multi-ethnic coalition. He\u2019s demonstrated that he\u2019s not interested in the evolution of our state. He intends to support those who remind him of himself.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric around the right to vote does get heated; it\u2019s an emotional issue, with a lot of historical baggage. Voter fraud is exceedingly rare\u2014a Brennan Center study found only 0.0001 percent of votes cast in 2016 resulted in investigations\u2014so civil rights advocates are skeptical that it\u2019s the real motivation for the bureaucratic squeeze on eligibility in Republican states. \u201cJim Crow with a billy club has been changed to James Crow Esquire with a briefcase,\u201d says Richard Rose, the head of the Atlanta NAACP. Andrea Young, the director of the Georgia branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the daughter of the legendary activist Andrew Young, and she feels like she\u2019s constantly trying to plug a legal dam her father\u2019s generation built.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a nonstop onslaught, and it\u2019s really discouraging,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much concern out there that the system is rigged, and it\u2019s not an irrational fear.\u201d\n\nThe danger for Abrams is that this kind of talk will discourage her voters, and she tries to balance her attacks on Kemp for rigging the system with assurances that showing up to vote can be the best revenge: \u201cVoter suppression isn\u2019t a bug in the system. It\u2019s the system! But we can beat the system.\u201d And: \u201cMake them tell you no. Don\u2019t tell yourself no.\u201d And: \u201cDisenfranchisement works not just by taking your vote but by taking your spirit. We need to spirit up!\u201d She often notes that Kemp was caught on tape expressing concern that he could lose if minorities exercise their right to vote in large numbers, which would be a banal observation about turnout for a Georgia Republican who didn\u2019t happen to be overseeing elections as secretary of state.\n\nBlacks are 32 percent of registered voters in Georgia, but in 2014 barely a third of them turned out, lagging far behind whites, and Abrams needs them to spirit up. The mantra from the civil rights community has been that if voting didn\u2019t matter, there wouldn\u2019t be so many schemes to stop it\u2014and so far, blacks are on pace to more than double their early vote from 2014. But I also heard a lot of dispirited grousing about rumors that Georgia\u2019s antiquated electronic voting machines, which Kemp has resisted updating or supplementing with a paper trail, have been flipping D votes to R. \u201cThey can make them machines do what they want to do,\u201d said Claudette Fagan, a 75-year-old retired nanny from Thomaston. \u201cIt\u2019s like Jim Crow all over again.\u201d\n\nThat kind of fatalism can be deadly to Democrats; depressed black turnout in 2016 helped swing Florida and key Rust Belt states from Obama to Trump. Dexter Sharper, an African-American state representative who came to support Abrams in Valdosta, says he\u2019s tired of the victim mentality that blames voter suppression for predictable defeats instead of doing the hard work necessary to win an uphill battle.\n\n\u201cI hear so many excuses: \u2018It\u2019s a Republican state, everything is rigged, nothing\u2019s gonna change,\u2019 Sharper said. \u201cOK, sure, blacks have to work harder to get ahead. So work harder!\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nCarl Fortson doesn\u2019t want to hear about how hard blacks have to work, how hard it is for blacks to vote, or how hard blacks have it in general. \u201cI\u2019m tired of all that racial mumbo-jumbo,\u201d the 69-year-old retired building official told me at a Kemp rally behind the Carrolls Sausage country store in Ashburn. I asked him whether the history of mistreatment of blacks in the South affected his thinking at all, and he scoffed that the history was just that.\n\n\u201cHave you ever owned a slave?\u201d Fortson asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI attended a half-dozen of Kemp\u2019s events in southern Georgia, and I never saw more than one black face in the crowd, although several Indian-Americans did attend a rally in Kingsland near the Florida border, including one local hotel owner on stage. None of the white people I met thought racism was a big problem in Georgia, and all of them thought the controversy over voting rights was fake news ginned up to help Abrams. \u201cThis ain\u2019t the 1950s,\u201d said Colt Ford, a 27-year-old taxidermist who showed up to a Kemp event in rural Nashville in camouflage. \u201cThe media pursues the racial divide, but everyone around here gets along.\u201d Josh Taylor, the police chief in Enigma, agreed racial tensions are overblown, and said he\u2019s never seen a Black Lives Matters protester in his tiny town: \u201cIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\nChuck Lanham, a 77-year-old retiree who wore a Make America Great Again cap to the Kingsland rally, said Obama nearly ruined race relations in this country, but blacks and whites in his neighborhood still get along fine: \u201cThey don\u2019t call me cracker and I don\u2019t call them darky.\u201d He did complain that Abrams wants to take down some prominent Confederate statues; he says they\u2019re part of the South\u2019s heritage, and he doesn\u2019t believe blacks are truly offended by them. \u201cYou never heard about this stuff until ten years ago,\u201d Lanham said. \u201cPeople just need something to complain about.\u201d\n\nThis racial disconnect seems just as intense on ballot issues. Gayle Henningfeld, a 72-year-old retired property manager who watched Kemp speak in the cotton town of Cordele\u2014at a history museum where the photographs were all of white faces\u2014said the entire fight over voter suppression was a manufactured racial controversy. \u201cGive me a break: If they can prove who they are, they\u2019ll get to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t it funny that they can find an ID to get cigarettes and alcohol?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd EBT!\u201d added her friend Beth Slocum, using shorthand for food stamps.\n\nThe Kemp supporters I met consistently described the election in ideological terms, a battle of capitalism against socialism, business against government, makers against takers. \u201cWe\u2019ve all worked hard for what we have, and we want to keep it,\u201d Fortson told me. \u201cAbrams wants to take it away to support people who don\u2019t work.\u201d Lace Futch, an 80-year-old Atkinson County commissioner who wore overalls to hear Kemp speak in his Trump-loving corner of the state, described the race as \u201ca choice between solvency and bankruptcy, between a conservative and a nut.\u201d\n\nBut Futch acknowledged that there\u2019s a tribal shirts-and-skins element to politics these days, and that Abrams doesn\u2019t wear his team\u2019s jersey. He said the blacks who blame vote suppression for their lack of power in Georgia ought to blame demographics and basic math: \u201cThey\u2019re only 25 percent of the state! Of course they\u2019re gonna be outvoted! That\u2019s the name of the game!\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Kemp about the whiteness of his base at a Nahunta barbecue joint, he said he rejected my premise, and mentioned a recent \u201cdiversity press conference\u201d and \u201cdiversity call center night\u201d featuring non-white supporters. He told me his pro-business message is much better for minorities than the big-government Abrams message, \u201cif they\u2019re really willing to be open-minded and listen.\u201d But he\u2019s polling in the low single digits among blacks, and his leaked comments that he could lose the election if they come out to vote in huge numbers were clearly correct. On the trail, Kemp warns his supporters that Democrats are hoping to reach presidential-year turnout in an off-year election, and that he believes they\u2019ll do it.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re motivated,\u201d he said in Ashburn. \u201cWe\u2019re literally fighting the rest of the country, and they\u2019re counting on you to be complacent. It\u2019s us against them.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nJimmy Lockett got out of jail on Father\u2019s Day, finally clean after 30 years of addiction. But he had no job, no place to live, and no ID, which made it even harder to find a job or a place to live. \u201cI felt like an alien, like E.T.\u2014except at least E.T. could phone home,\u201d Lockett told me before the Abrams rally in Columbus. He didn\u2019t even have a birth certificate, so he couldn\u2019t get a Georgia ID, until a non-profit called Spread the Vote tracked it down; Lockett had always thought he was a Louisiana native, but it turned out he was born in Tennessee. He\u2019s now working at IHOP, while serving as a peer mentor for the formerly incarcerated with a group called Don\u2019t Count Me Out. He also voted last week for the first time, and persuaded a friend to join him. \u201cIt\u2019s part of taking my life back and rejoining society,\u201d he says.\n\nSpread the Vote has helped more than 500 Georgians get IDs over the last year, and state director Fallon McClure says watching Lockett vote was a highlight. \u201cThe smile on his face was everything,\u201d she told me. But she says the ID bureaucracy is often absurdly unwieldy; for example, the vital statistics office where applicants can track down their records requires ID at the entrance. She sees these obstacles as outgrowths of white privilege, just like Georgia\u2019s efforts to limit early voting on Sundays when black churches run Souls to the Polls, or various county efforts to close polling stations accessible by public transit. McClure is a 31-year-old attorney, but when she goes to court, she invariably gets mistaken for a defendant even though she wears a suit and carries a briefcase. \u201cI even wear glasses to look more like a lawyer,\u201d she says with a rueful chuckle. \u201cSome things don\u2019t seem to change.\u201d\n\nIn the 2013 decision that rolled back the Voting Rights Act, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that decades of racial progress\u2014including the election of an African-American president\u2014had eliminated the need for \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d by the federal government to ensure unbiased state elections in states like Georgia. There is no doubt that, as Roberts wrote, \u201cour country has changed,\u201d but race has always been at the heart of the American story, and there is obviously a stark divide over how much it has changed. The ballot is still a battlefield, not only in Georgia but North Dakota, where voter ID laws that require street addresses seem targeted at Native Americans who live on reservations without them, or Kansas, where white officials in majority-Hispanic Dodge City moved the only polling place out of town, or 21 other states where Republican officials have prioritized eliminating voter fraud over maximizing voter participation. Voting is supposed to be how Americans resolve differences\u2014leaders of both parties chide uncivil protesters who harass politicians in restaurants\u2014but the drumbeat of stories about voting restrictions inevitably reduces confidence that voting can make a difference.\n\nThe current leader of the Republican Party, to put it mildly, has never been eager to bridge racial divisions. President Trump got his start in politics by questioning his black predecessor\u2019s citizenship, and he loves riling up his white supporters with culture-war attacks on prominent African-Americans like LeBron James, Don Lemon, Maxine Waters, NFL players who protest police brutality, and even the civil rights hero John Lewis, who was also inside the First Baptist Church in Montgomery during the siege. Trump has tweeted that Abrams is \u201ccrime-loving\u201d and \u201ctotally unqualified,\u201d an odd criticism to make of a Yale Law School graduate who served as the Democratic leader in the state assembly. And many GOP politicians are fashioning themselves in his politically incorrect image; in his primary, Kemp ran an ad suggesting he might use his own pickup truck to round up illegal immigrants in Georgia, which helped earn him Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\nThe midterms will help determine whether Republicans pay any price for pushing these envelopes, which will help determine whether the envelope-pushing continues. And in some states, the ballot itself will be on the ballot; there are an unprecedented number of voter referendums this year designed to expand voting rights and make the eligibility process easier, including a measure restoring the right of felons to vote after completing their sentence in Florida, and provisions creating automatic registration in Nevada, Michigan and Maryland. \u201cYou could see a really transformative backlash against this multi-year effort to restrict democracy,\u201d says Wendy Weiser, who runs the Brennan Center\u2019s voting rights program.\n\nIn Georgia, voters are voting, and turnout was up 146 percent over 2014 through Wednesday, with more than a third of the early vote from first-time voters. The Democratic voter hotline is getting about 300 calls a day, and some long lines discouraged voters in the first few days\u2014in part because counties closed more than 200 polling stations on Kemp\u2019s watch\u2014but there have not been widespread new reports of irregularities that would indicate Kemp\u2019s thumb on the scale.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they can steal this one,\u201d a 64-year-old equipment operator named Hildredge Bush told me before the Abrams speech at the Thomaston church. Bush is a Navy veteran with a political science degree, and he\u2019s felt all his life that the racist vestiges of Jim Crow have held him back from reaching his full potential. But now he believes the forces of progress are on the march. At least he hopes so.\n\n\u201cWe shall overcome the suppression, and we shall overcome it with politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any other way to overcome.\u201d\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.\n\nThis article tagged under: Letter From Georgia", "Former President Barack Obama points to Democratic candidate for Georgia Governor Stacey Abrams as he speaks during a campaign rally at Morehouse College on Friday. | John Bazemore/AP Photo Elections Obama boosts Abrams, bashes Kemp on voting rights in Georgia speech The former president touted Stacey Abrams ahead of Georgia's vote for governor.\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Former President Barack Obama joined the chorus of Democrats criticizing Georgia Republican gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp for his record on voting rights, contrasting the Georgia secretary of state with Democrat Stacey Abrams, whom the president called \"most experienced, most qualified candidate in this race.\"\n\nObama made the remarks in front of a packed audience at Morehouse College on Friday night, just a few days ahead of the midterm elections as Georgia braces for a close gubernatorial race.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama's voice grew noticeably hoarse as he spoke, as the former president travels the country stumping for Democratic candidates in this year's election. Standing next to Abrams, Obama tied Kemp to congressional Republicans, saying that they both are trying to disenfranchise voters and \"take away the right to vote.\" He alluded to the multiple lawsuits filed against Kemp over voting rights, saying the Republican had already been caught \"multiple times\" trying to roll back voter rights for Georgians.\n\n\"How can you actively try to prevent the citizens from your state from exercising their most basic right?\" Obama said in between boos from the crowd, before turning to Abrams: \"She is the most experienced, most qualified candidate in this.\"\n\nVoting rights was a persistent theme throughout the event. Earlier in the evening, former Attorney General Eric Holder made similar warnings about Kemp and national Republicans.\n\n\"There has been a systematic effort to cripple our democracy and disenfranchise those who do not subscribe to certain political views,\" Holder said.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

For eight years, he said, Republicans worked frantically to repeal Obamacare, including protections for those with preexisting conditions.\n\n\"So now it's election season and suddenly, magically, Republicans are out there running ads saying we're going to protect you if you've got pre-conditions,\" Obama said. \"I mean, they voted multiple times\" to repeal it.\n\n\"Not only will they not own up to what they have done,\" Obama said. \"Suddenly they are saying that they're the ones to protect people with preexisting conditions. I want everyone to pay attention to this. They have literally been doing the opposite. It's like calling black, white. It requires some kind of gumption.\"\n\nObama never called Kemp out by name but said he wouldn't expand Medicaid in office, which Abrams has made a key pillar of her policy platform.\n\n\"Stacey's opponent says he won't do it,\" Obama said. \"Stacey has promised and will do it. She will expand Medicaid coverage.\"\n\nThen he went local again, making fun of Kemp for not agreeing to debate Abrams on Sunday. The timing of the debate coincided with President Donald Trump doing a rally for Georgia Republicans in Macon.\n\n\"I saw her opponent backed out of a debate,\" Obama said. \"What's he afraid of?

But the 49-year-old conservative lawyer has also been dogged by conflict of interest concerns because he previously worked as a partner at Jones Day, the same law firm that represents Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign in the Russia probe.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOfficials at the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington have been arguing for months that to oversee the Mueller probe, Francisco would require a White House waiver to circumvent a Trump executive order that decreed employees must recuse themselves from work on any matters involving previous employers going back two years.\n\nTurns out, Francisco actually got a White House waiver of that type in April. It\u2019s not clear what triggered the waiver or if it had anything to do with Mueller\u2019s investigation, but a senior Justice official on Friday downplayed its significance and insisted the department isn\u2019t aware of any impediments to Francisco taking over responsibility for managing the Mueller probe if Rosenstein left his position.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nThe DOJ official also pointed out the department has its own ethics rules that include prohibitions both equal to, and stronger than, the White House that could prohibit Francisco from working on matters related to Jones Day clients.\n\nA CREW official said the group just learned about the waiver on Friday after the Justice Department responded to its request for the document. In a blog post , CREW called the waiver \u201ctroubling\u201d because it isn\u2019t posted on an Office of Government Ethics website that lists 28 other Trump administration officials who have so far received waivers to work on matters related to their previous employers.\n\nThe group also took issue with the waiver appearing to be signed by then-White House counsel Don McGahn, who also worked with Francisco at Jones Day before joining the Trump administration. McGahn had similarly pledged not to participate in matters involving his former law firm.\n\n\u201cBy authorizing Mr. Francisco to participate in the investigation, Mr. McGahn himself participated in the investigation,\u201d CREW wrote.\n\nEven with the White House waiver, CREW said Francisco still has other conflicts that should prevent him from taking on the Mueller oversight job, which involves signing off on the special counsel\u2019s budget and decisions on subpoenas, indictments and the public disclosure of a final report.\n\nThe group noted that Jones Day still owes Francisco about $500,000 as part of its separation agreement when he left at the start of the Trump administration in January 2017. It also questioned his role as a lawyer on Trump\u2019s transition team, which also has been pulled into the Mueller investigation.\n\nA White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Francisco\u2019s April waiver.\n\nRosenstein\u2019s status in the Trump administration has been in limbo for months, prompting DOJ to dust off its succession plans at each whiff of a shakeup. Most recently, the deputy attorney general\u2019s job appeared to be in jeopardy after a New York Times story published in September described Rosenstein\u2019s proposal to wear a wire to record the president.\n\nPeople close to Rosenstein have said some of the pressure around his job has abated, at least for now. The deputy attorney general flew with Trump on Air Force One in early October, and the president later that day said he had no plans to fire the No. 2 Justice official.\n\nStill, it remains unclear if Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions will remain in their jobs much beyond Tuesday\u2019s midterm election. Sessions has drawn repeated rebukes from Trump because he recused himself from overseeing the department\u2019s probe into Kremlin meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBeyond Francisco, several other DOJ officials have their own conflict issues, including Steven Engel, the director of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, who is next in line to oversee the Mueller probe.\n\nEngel\u2019s challenge centers around his time working as a lawyer on Trump\u2019s transition team. He also has some possible ethical concerns related to his prior employment at the law firm Dechert when it was representing James Comey, whose May 2017 firing from the FBI remains part of the probe into whether Trump obstructed the Russia probe.\n\nAfter Engel is John Demers, the head of Justice\u2019s National Security Division and a former Boeing attorney who doesn\u2019t have any apparent conflicts.\n\nTrump could also try to create a new legal route for picking Mueller\u2019s supervisor from among the ranks of presidential appointees or even an unconfirmed DOJ official, though the legality of such a move is unresolved.", "\u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t inspire love and hope and prosperity for everybody,\u201d one attendee said. \u201cObama gives us a reason to believe that Obama will be better tomorrow.\u201d | AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee Obama versus Trump: Two Americas at war on the Florida campaign trail\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Barack Obama versus Donald Trump. \u201cBring It Home!\u201d versus \u201cLock Him Up!\u201d\n\nIn front of adoring and amped-up crowds this week, the former president and his successor rallied their parties' bases in Florida, home of deadlocked and intensely watched races for U.S. Senate and governor in the nation's largest swing state. Florida has an electorate that's such a national bellwether that it can seem more schizophrenic than truly red or blue.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFlorida elected Obama in 2008 and 2012, but then swung hard right in 2016 by voting in Trump, who rallied Wednesday in Southwest Florida and returns Saturday to the Panhandle, two Republican-rich areas that made Florida Trump Country.\n\nSandwiched between those Trump stops in Florida, the first African-American president gambled Friday that he could help turn Florida back into Obama Country in Democrat-heavy Miami with a message calibrated to draw a sharp contrast with the harsh tone of his successor, especially over immigration.\n\n\u201cThe character of our country is on the ballot,\u201d Obama told a crowd of 4,000. \u201cIn the closing weeks of this election, we have seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric designed to make us angry and make us fearful, that\u2019s designed to exploit our history of racial and ethnic and religious division, that pits us against one another to make us believe that order will somehow be restored if it just weren\u2019t for those folks who don\u2019t look like we look, or don\u2019t love like we love, or pray like we do.\u201d\n\nThe crowd in Miami interrupted him with a clapping chant that\u2019s the slogan of Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign for governor: \u201cBring it home!\u201d\n\nTwo days before, on the other side of the peninsula, the current president\u2019s rhetoric was a world away.\n\n\u201cRepublicans want strong borders, no crime, no chaos and no caravans. Democrats want open borders, and they want to invite caravan after caravan into our country, which brings crime upon crime,\u201d Trump said in Fort Myers in a filled-to-capacity arena. \u201cA vote for Democrats is a vote to liquidate America's borders. And it's a vote to let meth, fentanyl, heroin, and other deadly drugs pour across our borders, drugs that take the lives of over \u2014 think of this \u2014 over 70,000 Americans a year.\u201d\n\nFlorida Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis, right, campaigns with his wife, Casey, and President Donald Trump during a rally Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, in Estero, Fla. | Chris O'Meara/AP Photo\n\nThe crowd at one point broke out with the longstanding Trump campaign chant: \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d Unprompted, they chanted \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d at one point. And they booed when the opposing candidates were mentioned by name. Obama\u2019s crowd did it, too.\n\nBut both presidents had a different response. Trump said little as the boos rained down. Obama often responded, \u201cdon\u2019t boo, vote!\u201d\n\nThe two sides also fracture along racial lines.\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party recently became a majority-minority party. And the Obama rally was multiracial. The Republican Party of Florida is disproportionately white compared to the state\u2019s general population and its registered voters overall. And Trump\u2019s rally was overwhelmingly white.\n\nGillum \u2014 Florida\u2019s first African-American Democratic nominee for governor \u2014 and Sen. Bill Nelson are pulling a disproportionate share of the non-white vote and their opponents, Ron DeSantis and Gov. Rick Scott, have outsized support among white voters.\n\nAt each rally, voters mentioned race without prompting when asked to describe the different Floridas on display in Trump\u2019s America and Obama\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, a lot of people voted for Obama just because he was black. And that was that. He didn\u2019t have anything to go by,\u201d said Dean Parave, a 54-year-old Naples resident who attended his fifth Trump rally on Wednesday. \u201cHe made a lot of promises, he didn\u2019t keep any. What did they have to go by? Just his race.\u201d\n\nObama rallygoer Ellen Kaplan had a far different take: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s America is the America of old white men who are afraid of giving up what power they have.\u201d\n\nAnother Democrat at the Wednesday rally, Crystal Romero-Sherman of Boca Raton, said Trump is negative and Obama\u2019s positive.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t inspire love and hope and prosperity for everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cObama gives us a reason to believe that it will be better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTrump rallygoer Gina Vithoulkas summed up her view of the divide this way: \u201cHe\u2019s evil. Obama is evil.\u201d\n\nAt his rally for Gillum and Nelson, Obama brought up the issue of anger in Trump\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time?\u201d Obama asked to applause. \u201cWhen I won the presidency, at least my side felt pretty good. It tells ya something interesting, that even the folks who are in charge are still mad \u2018cause they\u2019re getting ginned up to be mad. That\u2019s the mindset.\u201d\n\nDeSantis, who earned a reputation for getting mad after losing his temper with a debate moderator last week, has made the race for governor more of a referendum on Gillum\u2019s character, and specifically an FBI investigation swirling around City Hall in Tallahassee where the Democrat serves as mayor.\n\nDeSantis used the Tallahassee investigation as a point of departure to criticize Gillum\u2019s call for impeaching Trump, whose campaign is under federal investigation.\n\n\u201cHe's running on impeaching the president. For what?\u201d DeSantis asked the crowd as it booed Gillum\u2019s name. \u201cThis is a guy that took bribes from an undercover FBI agent, took money from a lobbyist, did favors for the lobbyist. Maybe we should impeach Gillum as mayor of Tallahassee!\"\n\n\u201cLock him up!\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\nDays later, Gillum had his chance to rebut DeSantis, accusing him of being dishonest over his repeated votes to repeal Obamacare and his newfound promise to protect insurance coverage for people with preexisting conditions. But more broadly, Gillum sought to portray the election as a choice between hope and divisiveness.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to send Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Trump a message on Nov. 6,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cWe have a chance to send them an unapologetic message. One that will no longer confuse them \u2014 that their brand of politics is no longer acceptable in the state of Florida at all.

Florida has an electorate that's such a national bellwether that it can seem more schizophrenic than truly red or blue.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFlorida elected Obama in 2008 and 2012, but then swung hard right in 2016 by voting in Trump, who rallied Wednesday in Southwest Florida and returns Saturday to the Panhandle, two Republican-rich areas that made Florida Trump Country.\n\nSandwiched between those Trump stops in Florida, the first African-American president gambled Friday that he could help turn Florida back into Obama Country in Democrat-heavy Miami with a message calibrated to draw a sharp contrast with the harsh tone of his successor, especially over immigration.\n\n\u201cThe character of our country is on the ballot,\u201d Obama told a crowd of 4,000. \u201cIn the closing weeks of this election, we have seen repeated attempts to divide us with rhetoric designed to make us angry and make us fearful, that\u2019s designed to exploit our history of racial and ethnic and religious division, that pits us against one another to make us believe that order will somehow be restored if it just weren\u2019t for those folks who don\u2019t look like we look, or don\u2019t love like we love, or pray like we do.\u201d\n\nThe crowd in Miami interrupted him with a clapping chant that\u2019s the slogan of Democrat Andrew Gillum\u2019s campaign for governor: \u201cBring it home!\u201d\n\nTwo days before, on the other side of the peninsula, the current president\u2019s rhetoric was a world away.\n\n\u201cRepublicans want strong borders, no crime, no chaos and no caravans. Democrats want open borders, and they want to invite caravan after caravan into our country, which brings crime upon crime,\u201d Trump said in Fort Myers in a filled-to-capacity arena. \u201cA vote for Democrats is a vote to liquidate America's borders. And it's a vote to let meth, fentanyl, heroin, and other deadly drugs pour across our borders, drugs that take the lives of over \u2014 think of this \u2014 over 70,000 Americans a year.\u201d\n\nFlorida Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis, right, campaigns with his wife, Casey, and President Donald Trump during a rally Wednesday, Oct. 31, 2018, in Estero, Fla. | Chris O'Meara/AP Photo\n\nThe crowd at one point broke out with the longstanding Trump campaign chant: \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d Unprompted, they chanted \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d at one point. And they booed when the opposing candidates were mentioned by name. Obama\u2019s crowd did it, too.\n\nBut both presidents had a different response. Trump said little as the boos rained down. Obama often responded, \u201cdon\u2019t boo, vote!\u201d\n\nThe two sides also fracture along racial lines.\n\nThe Florida Democratic Party recently became a majority-minority party. And the Obama rally was multiracial. The Republican Party of Florida is disproportionately white compared to the state\u2019s general population and its registered voters overall. And Trump\u2019s rally was overwhelmingly white.\n\nGillum \u2014 Florida\u2019s first African-American Democratic nominee for governor \u2014 and Sen. Bill Nelson are pulling a disproportionate share of the non-white vote and their opponents, Ron DeSantis and Gov. Rick Scott, have outsized support among white voters.\n\nAt each rally, voters mentioned race without prompting when asked to describe the different Floridas on display in Trump\u2019s America and Obama\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cIn all honesty, a lot of people voted for Obama just because he was black. And that was that. He didn\u2019t have anything to go by,\u201d said Dean Parave, a 54-year-old Naples resident who attended his fifth Trump rally on Wednesday. \u201cHe made a lot of promises, he didn\u2019t keep any. What did they have to go by? Just his race.\u201d\n\nObama rallygoer Ellen Kaplan had a far different take: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s America is the America of old white men who are afraid of giving up what power they have.\u201d\n\nAnother Democrat at the Wednesday rally, Crystal Romero-Sherman of Boca Raton, said Trump is negative and Obama\u2019s positive.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t inspire love and hope and prosperity for everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cObama gives us a reason to believe that it will be better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTrump rallygoer Gina Vithoulkas summed up her view of the divide this way: \u201cHe\u2019s evil. Obama is evil.\u201d\n\nAt his rally for Gillum and Nelson, Obama brought up the issue of anger in Trump\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cWhy is it that the folks that won the last election are so mad all the time?\u201d Obama asked to applause. \u201cWhen I won the presidency, at least my side felt pretty good. It tells ya something interesting, that even the folks who are in charge are still mad \u2018cause they\u2019re getting ginned up to be mad. That\u2019s the mindset.\u201d\n\nDeSantis, who earned a reputation for getting mad after losing his temper with a debate moderator last week, has made the race for governor more of a referendum on Gillum\u2019s character, and specifically an FBI investigation swirling around City Hall in Tallahassee where the Democrat serves as mayor.\n\nDeSantis used the Tallahassee investigation as a point of departure to criticize Gillum\u2019s call for impeaching Trump, whose campaign is under federal investigation.\n\n\u201cHe's running on impeaching the president. For what?\u201d DeSantis asked the crowd as it booed Gillum\u2019s name. \u201cThis is a guy that took bribes from an undercover FBI agent, took money from a lobbyist, did favors for the lobbyist. Maybe we should impeach Gillum as mayor of Tallahassee!\"\n\n\u201cLock him up!\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\nDays later, Gillum had his chance to rebut DeSantis, accusing him of being dishonest over his repeated votes to repeal Obamacare and his newfound promise to protect insurance coverage for people with preexisting conditions. But more broadly, Gillum sought to portray the election as a choice between hope and divisiveness.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to send Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Trump a message on Nov. 6,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cWe have a chance to send them an unapologetic message. One that will no longer confuse them \u2014 that their brand of politics is no longer acceptable in the state of Florida at all. At all.\u201d"]
