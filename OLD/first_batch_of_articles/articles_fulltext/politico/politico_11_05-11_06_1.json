Competing in an electoral landscape tilted heavily in their favor, with a slate of seats in conservative states represented by Democrats, the GOP still exceeded expectations. The party will pad its 51-49 majority by at least one seat, and as many as five seats if late races in Nevada, Arizona and Montana break their way. That outcome would potentially cement control of the chamber for years to come.\n\nTwo outstanding races in Arizona and Nevada could be the difference between a bad night for Democrats and a disastrous one.\n\nRepublicans avoided upsets of their own. The much-hyped race in Texas between Sen. Ted Cruz and Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke went their way, despite record fundraising and adoring press coverage of the Democrat. Republicans also preserved their seat in Tennessee, where Rep. Marsha Blackburn easily dispatched former Gov. Phil Bredesen.\n\nDemocrats did notch an early victory in West Virginia to limit their potential losses, however, with Sen. Joe Manchin holding his seat.\n\nDemocrats also avoided upsets of heavily-favored incumbents in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In New Jersey, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) hung on against Republican Bob Hugin despite late worries among Democrats that the seat might be at risk.\n\n\n\nNevada also remains a tossup. Republican Sen. Dean Heller is the party\u2019s only incumbent running in a state Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, and has relied on his alliance with Trump to energize the GOP base and counter Democratic enthusiasm in the race against first-term Democratic Rep.

Democrats still had an opportunity to break new ground: In Arizona, voters last sent a Democrat to the Senate 1988, and Rep.

Had Gillum prevailed in Florida \u2014 or had Stacey Abrams prevailed in Georgia, where she was still in the running, but lagging behind \u2014 the election might have hastened the rise of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nWhile the Democrats\u2019 growing coalition of younger, non-white voters ran into headwinds in statewide contests Tuesday, a cast of more establishment Democrats was struggling, too. In Indiana, Donnelly aired television ads criticizing the \u201cradical left\u201d for its positions on health care and immigration. And in Wisconsin, which Trump carried two years ago, Democrats are relying not on a liberal firebrand to unseat Republican Gov.

Barbara Comstock, who won reelection in 2016 even as Trump lost badly in the district. The same trend saw Florida Rep. Carlos Curbelo, Illinois Rep. Peter Roskam, Minnesota Rep. Erik Paulsen, Kansas Rep. Kevin Yoder, Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman and more all lose in districts that Clinton carried, despite frustrating Democrats in past years with their ability to escape battleground challenges.\n\nBut Democrats also expanded their gains into some districts where Trump was strong. In Virginia, Democrats Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger toppled Republican Reps. Scott Taylor and Dave Brat in districts that backed the president in 2016, while Democrat Anthony Brindisi won in a red-trending upstate New York district.

In South Carolina, Democrat Joe Cunningham holds a slight lead over Republican Katie Arrington, who unseated Rep. Mark Sanford in a primary earlier this year.

Mia Love in a heavily Republican district, where Sen.-elect Mitt Romney aired TV ads urging supporters to back Love as well.\n\nOne upset victory came out of Oklahoma, where Democrat Kendra Horn, a former congressional aide, knocked out GOP Rep.

But a government ethics expert said it raised new questions about whether the secretary was using government resources for personal purposes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNeighbors said the incident began when they noticed a black Mercedes with New York license plates idling for several hours outside a residence Zinke has rented since he was a member of Congress. It is unclear why the Park Police, who are part of the Interior Department, were called to the home rather than the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The home is around the corner from Lincoln Park, a small square overseen by the National Park Service.\n\nPaul Legere, who lives next door, said he asked the driver of the Mercedes to move the car, which was blocking several parking spaces on the crowded street. The driver refused to move, and the two got into an argument around 9 p.m. Monday, Legere said.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAs Legere and the driver were exchanging words, a man exited the house. He \u201ccomes to my window and says, \u2018I\u2019m Secretary Zinke, and this is my house, and that is my driver,\u2019\u201d Legere recalled in an interview Tuesday morning.\n\nLegere said the man appeared to have been drinking and would give only his first name, Scott. Scott called the U.S. Park Service Police, then told the driver to leave, which he did, Legere said. About five minutes later, another vehicle dropped off one more man, who went into Zinke\u2019s house carrying two bags, and five minutes after that the Park Police showed up in two SUVs, \u201cfully riot-geared out,\u201d Legere said.\n\nAfter questioning Legere and other witnesses, the Park Police told neighbors that the man was authorized to be in Zinke's house and then left. Not long after that, the Mercedes returned and picked up the men from Zinke\u2019s home and drove off, Legere said. The witnesses said they did not see Zinke at any point during the incident.\n\n\u201cI'm still pretty annoyed at this person pretending to be Zinke to intimidate a neighbor, and then calling the Park Police for protection, but I guess that's just me,\u201d Regina Arlotto, another resident of the neighborhood who witnessed the incident, wrote in an email listserv for residents of the Lincoln Park section of D.C. \u201cNothing makes sense anymore.\u201d\n\nArlotto confirmed her account in an interview with POLITICO.\n\nAn Interior spokesperson said Zinke was home at the time and that he was the one who called the Park Police.\n\n\u201cSecretary Zinke and his friends were watching football and BBQing at home last night. Zinke called his security detail with concerns about a suspicious individual staking out his home and guests. While waiting for the USPP to arrive, another individual began yelling profanities in the street about the President and the Secretary,\u201d spokesperson Faith Vander Voort said in a statement. \u201cThe Secretary remained inside his home the entire night while the USPP responded.\u201d\n\nLegere and Arlotto disputed the department\u2019s statement. \u201cHa! Nothing about that is true,\u201d Legere wrote in an email.\n\nArlotto, who lives two doors away, said she doubted Zinke was home because his car was not parked out front as it typically is when he\u2019s at the house, and she said she neither smelled smoke from a grill nor noticed any activity outside.\n\n\u201cI know for a fact no one at all yelled profanities about the President OR the Secretary,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cWe had all gone into our houses and I was sitting in my bay window, and heard nothing. The next thing I knew was that the USPP were outside on the sidewalk. And if Zinke was there, the police officers didn't act like it. Instead the [sergeant] said that guy was \u2018authorized\u2019 to \u2018stay\u2019 in the house? it was very strangely worded.\u201d\n\nA Park Police spokesperson, Sgt. Eduardo Delgado, confirmed that officers had been dispatched to Zinke\u2019s address Monday night but said he could not immediately release a copy of the police report before it was reviewed to see whether any information needed to be redacted. Delgado said he was unsure why uniformed Park Police officers responded instead of Zinke's security detail; he said it was possible the officers were already in the area patrolling Lincoln Park.\n\nLocal D.C. police were not involved, said Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Alaina Gertz. The park police would be the lead agency involved if they were first called, but Gertz expressed confusion at their involvement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why in this scenario why they would call them instead of 911,\u201d Gertz added.\n\nIf the guest made use of the park police with Zinke\u2019s knowledge, it could be construed as Zinke using his office for personal gain, said Marilyn Glynn, who was acting director of the Office of Government Ethics under former President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cIn a case like this, the \u2018private gain\u2019 is the benefit that would accrue to the Secretary and his guest by keeping the neighbors off his back and keeping the incident out of the news,\u201d Glynn said. \u201cUsing agency employees for private matters has occurred in the past with other [executive branch] employees \u2014 e.g., picking up laundry, babysitting kids \u2014 but has always been recognized as an abuse of office.\u201d\n\nZinke has come under fire in the past over accusations of questionable uses of park police staff and Interior Department resources.\n\nThe secretary used a park police helicopter to fly him from official events outside D.C. back to the capital in time to make personal meetings, including a horseback ride with Vice President Mike Pence, as first reported by POLITICO. In August 2017, he also brought park police as security with him and his wife on personal travel to Turkey and Greece, a move that cost taxpayers about $25,000, according to a recent Interior inspector general's report.\n\nHe also used park police to transport family members and friends, according to the same IG report. In 2017, he used a park police boat to take family on a tour of the Channel Islands in California and the Statue of Liberty in New York, according to the report. He also had his security detail drive a friend to an airport, despite knowing they could not do so without the secretary in the vehicle, the report says.\n\nThe house belongs to Cynthia Kennard, executive director at the philanthropic Annenberg Foundation, and Vittorio Morandin, according to D.C. public records. The pair rent out the property, records show.\n\nNeighbors said Zinke moved into the house soon after he was elected as Montana\u2019s sole member of Congress in 2014, but he has been seen in the neighborhood only sporadically over the past several months.\n\nKennard and Morandin could not be reached for comment, and an Annenberg spokesperson did not reply to questions.\n\nThe Mercedes that was parked out front is linked to a New York-based Uber driver, according to a search of the license plate number in public records. A voicemail left at a phone number included in those records was not immediately returned Monday.\n\nNo one answered the door of the house when a reporter knocked Tuesday morning.\n\nZack Colman contributed to this report.", "Donald Trump\u2019s political foes have branded him a demagogue, a budding fascist and even a Russian puppet. Scholars have emptied their inkwells describing his authoritarian ways in their many books about the decline of democracy. Civil libertarians have denounced his ethno-nationalistic rants at midterm campaign rallies, his battering of the First Amendment, his goading supporters to commit political violence, and his plans to rewrite the Constitution with executive orders.\n\nHow do we thank the president for all he has done? His incitements have caused one of the greatest boons to representative democracy since the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Without Trump, the current midterms would likely have been their usually dreary self, with the party not holding the White House picking up a modest number of seats and nobody but party officials, journalists and a scattering of the civic-minded really caring all that much about the outcome. But thanks to Trump\u2019s policies and barnstorming provocations, polls have detected near-record enthusiasm for the midterms, with 70 percent calling themselves highly interested in the election, compared to 61 percent in the 2006 and 2010 midterms. Voter registration has likewise swelled in several states holding key races, and the greatest number of absentee ballots for a midterm election (36 million) have been cast, up 75 percent over 2014. The early youth vote is up 144 percent in Illinois, 111 percent in Florida, and 362 percent in Georgia. Name an earnest get-out-the-vote campaign of the past 20 years that has ever notched those kinds of numbers.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAm I wrong to attribute our democratic orgy to Trump? I think not. As John Hudak of the Brookings Institution points out, good economic times resound at the ballot box to the benefit of the party holding the White House, and these are very good economic times. Popular presidents also stir large midterm turnouts. Trump doesn\u2019t qualify as a popular president, with only lackluster approval ratings, but among his most devout followers he commands a godlike status that makes up for his ratings deficiencies. Could any current Democratic aspirant for the White House fill aircraft hangars and arenas in red-state America the way he does and make them howl? He\u2019s the most popular unpopular president we\u2019ve ever had.\n\nThe Trump virus still seems to be having its way with red-state America. But every virus entering the body politic creates an antibody, and the Trump antibody has been equally potent. The Democrats treated Trump\u2019s special brand of politics and personality as fodder for lampoonery in 2016. But in 2018, the same package has bestirred Democrats to conduct their midterm campaigns as if waging Armageddon. It\u2019s hard to imagine Democrats mounting such a furious midterm fight against a President Romney or a President McCain. Trump arouses a competitive something in Democrats we haven\u2019t seen since Richard Nixon enraged them with his autocratic skulduggery. What he\u2019s better than Nixon at doing is capturing the Democratic responses to his provocations and then inserting them into a feedback loop. Recent example: He nominated hardcore conservative Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and then repurposed Capitol Hill protests against Kavanaugh as an example of how the Democrats advocate mob rule.\n\nApproaching politics like a reality show, Trump inserts new plot points into the drama whenever the going gets slow and the ratings falter. He\u2019s incredibly mindful of \u201cratings,\u201d even imaginary ones, making mention of them at least 24 times since becoming president, according to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cYou know, I am a ratings person,\u201d he told Sean Hannity last month. He has repeatedly called his show, \"The Apprentice,\" the No. 1 show on TV\u2014even though it wasn\u2019t. He boasted about the ratings he got when he greeted returning American prisoners from North Korea, claimed credit for the high ratings \"Roseanne\" got on its return to the airwaves, and toasted former press secretary Sean Spicer for his \u201cratings.\u201d\n\nAnd now he has taken credit for the midterms, too. At a campaign rally in Cleveland, Trump insisted he had made a fortune for the media he loves to bash. \u201cYou know the midterm elections used to be, like, boring, didn't they?\" Trump said. \"Do you even remember what they were? People say midterms, they say, 'What is that, what is it,' right? Now it's like the hottest thing.\"\n\nAnd he\u2019s right on every count.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s ratings-obsessed mind, getting the hate-watchers to tune in has been as important to his mission as attracting fans. Trump loves to be loved. But he also loves to be hated, and this reality show instinct might have taken the upper hand during the midterms. At press time, one political insider said seven Senate races were so close that the difference between a terrific night and a catastrophe for both parties was painfully thin. If the Democrats take full advantage of Trump\u2019s fomentations and win the House of Representatives, as many predict, and improve their standing in the Senate, Trump will be the loser. And if they don\u2019t, well, there will be another two years of the highest-stakes reality show the world has ever seen. Who knows what that will portend for 2020, but one thing is for certain: Voting, that foundational act of democracy, is back.\n\n******\n\n\u201cAs democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart\u2019s desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron,\u201d wrote H.L. Mencken in 1920.

Mikhail Metzel/TASS (Photo by Mikhail Metzel\\TASS via Getty Images) | Mikhail Metzel/Getty Washington And The World Why Putin Isn\u2019t Sweating the Midterms The Kremlin strongman has invested in Trump because he\u2019s disrupting the world order. Win or lose on Tuesday, that will continue.\n\nWith a short high-profile meeting between Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump possibly happening this weekend in Paris and a more comprehensive session later this month in Buenos Aires, many in Russia are asking the question, why meet at all? After all, each of their previous meetings\u2014in Hamburg in 2017 and then in Helsinki last July\u2014seemed to leave Russian-American relations in even worse shape than before. Some are advising the Kremlin to stay clear of Trump\u2019s White House, and not be drawn into America\u2019s fractious and ruthless domestic politics. The operative theory behind that counsel appears to be, let America\u2019s cold civil war blow over before re-engaging with the winner of 2020.\n\nYet, Putin is determined to continue his face-to-face contacts with Trump. Why such seemingly illogical behavior? It may be that the Russian president has already picked the winner\u2014and it is Trump. In his recent public remarks, before the Valdai Club in Sochi, Putin suggested that when Trump wins his second term in 2020, he will be freer to stabilize and normalize relations with Russia. Putin certainly hopes that the investment he is making in Trump will pay off, and he is prepared to be patient.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis is not to say of course that Putin will get Trump re-elected\u2014to repeat the coup that many in the U.S. believe he has already performed in 2016. Rather, Putin\u2019s insistence on dealing with Trump signals that he sees an opportunity in the U.S. president that others in Moscow do not.\n\nFor many in the Russian foreign policy community, there is a clear sense that Congress has already boxed in Trump on issues like sanctions, that the Kremlin\u2019s high hopes for another reset are already dashed, and that Trump\u2019s penchant for being unpredictable creates more than its fair share of risks. The new Congress promises more of the same: more sanctions, more investigations, more accusations about the Trump-Russia connection. Thus, they say, engaging with Trump is futile\u2014and especially so if the Republican Party loses much ground in the midterms on Tuesday.\n\nThe problem with this line of analysis is that it totally misses what Putin sees in Trump. The Russian leader\u2019s investment in the U.S. president has little to do with Congress, or with U.S. Russia policy, or whether or not the GOP gets a drubbing in the midterms. To Putin, Trump represents a new departure in U.S. foreign policy. What Putin considers positive for Russia is the disruption that Trump is creating for the global system that the United States has underwritten since the end of the Cold War. Trump is replacing liberal universalism with a version of great-power politics that is not focused on promoting U.S.-favored values. To be sure, it is a policy of strength, but it is clearly preferable to the policy of values, since it rests on a transactional approach to international affairs and allows for compromise.\n\nIn this, Trump, for all his idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies, is the most avowedly Russia-friendly American leader Putin is likely to encounter. This is not due to any special affection that the 45th president has for Russia. Simply put, Russia, to Trump, is not America\u2019s major problem. Trump wants a \u201cgreat America,\u201d the world\u2019s mightiest power that is focused mostly on what it regards as its own national interests. Putin does not mind it: In fact, such an America would be ideal for Russia. What is most important to Moscow is that Washington minds its own business, and does not seek to impose itself on others.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s focus on great-power rivalries, including with Russia, is welcome to Putin. One, because it agrees with his own realist view of international relations. Two, because it acknowledges Russia\u2019s own great power status. America\u2019s transition from the universalist to a more nationalist posture actually began with President Barack Obama\u2019s retrenchment policy. It has greatly accelerated under Trump, whose actions are transforming the world in the direction of multipolarity. America\u2019s European allies, who have long forfeited strategic sovereignty to Washington, are fretting. Putin feels vindicated by Trump\u2019s efforts to reduce U.S.\u2019s commitments to its allies. Putin also no doubt knows that this is how great empires end: invincible from without, those at the center lose interest in carrying the burden of hegemony or leadership. And so, they whither.\n\nThus, Putin, a consummate here-and-now politician, not only cannot afford the luxury of tuning out the Trump presidency and waiting it out: He has no reason to shun Trump. When Putin came to power nearly 19 years ago, it may have looked that while much of the world had exited the 20th century for the 21st, Moscow had chosen the other door. Now, much of the world is following Russia\u2019s choice, including the Trump administration. This means that, for all the disparity in power and difference of interests, the Kremlin and the White House now talk the same language. And they talk.\n\nDmitri Trenin is director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n\nThis article tagged under: Russia\n\nMidterms\n\nPutin", "K Street contemplates divided government\n\nWith David Beavers and Sarah Cammarata\n\nK STREET CONTEMPLATES DIVIDED GOVERNMENT: No one knows what will happen when voters finish casting their ballots today, but Democrats are favored to retake the House and Republicans are favored to hold the Senate \u2014 which would mean a return to divided government. Gridlock has meant less business on K Street in the past, since clients generally are most eager to hire lobbyists when Congress is working on legislation they favor or working on bills they fear. But this time could be different, since House Democrats have indicated they\u2019ll launch investigations that could make corporate America nervous. \u201cThat will throw off a lot of work for law firms\u201d with lobbying practices, Rich Gold, the leader of Holland & Knight\u2019s public policy and regulation group, said in an interview.

Some lawmakers say Californians are being \u2018held hostage\u2019 over the measure by the soda industry, which spent $7 million on a ballot initiative that would have made it much harder for cities to raise taxes of any kind.

Here are the five biggest stories of the election:\n\nDemocrats haven retaken the House majority, netting 27 seats so far.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSwept out of power in the 2010 tea party wave, Democrats are hoping to capitalize on backlash against President Donald Trump with gains big enough to recapture the chamber. POLITICO\u2019s final race ratings have 216 seats leaning to Democrats \u2014 just under the 218 needed for a majority \u2014 and 197 seats in the Republican column, with 22 seats left as toss-ups. Democrats have to flip 23 districts in order to take the House, and with so many tight races, a small swing could mean the difference between a \u201cblue wave\u201d and Republicans narrowly holding onto their majority.\n\nSo far, Democrats have won 29 GOP-held seats, while Republicans have clawed two back. The pickups are mostly GOP-held districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, like Virginia's 10th District, where Democrat Jennifer Wexton beat Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) for Democrats' first pickup of the night. But big Democratic surprises came out of Staten Island, where Max Rose beat Republican Rep. Dan Donovan in New York's 11th District, and in Oklahoma, where Democrat Kendra Horn notched a long-shot victory over GOP Rep. Steve Russell in a heavily Republican district. Democrat Joe Cunningham also defeated Republican Katie Arrington in South Carolina's 1st District, where Arrington defeated GOP Rep. Mark Sanford in a primary earlier this year.\n\n(See POLITICO\u2019s House results page here.)\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know.

Republicans also held on to Tennessee, where GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn defeated former Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen. Republicans still have targets to expand their Senate majority, currently at 51-49. In Florida, the battle between Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and GOP Gov. Rick Scott is incredibly close. Scott currently leads Nelson with nearly all precincts reporting.\n\nDemocrats are looking for a few flips of their own, with their best chances against Sen. Dean Heller in Nevada and in an open seat in Arizona. But Republicans beat their candidates in Tennessee and Texas, two long-shot races.\n\nIn Mississippi, GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith will face Democrat Mike Espy in a special election runoff.\n\n(See POLITICO\u2019s Senate results page here.)\n\nSplit decision in the statehouses\n\nRepublicans currently hold 33 governorships, but Democrats are hoping retake power in statehouses around the country. Democrats have won three open governor's races in GOP states so far: Illinois, where Democrat J.B. Pritzker defeated Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner; Michigan, where Democrat Gretchen Whitmer beat Republican Bill Schuette; and Kansas, where Democrat Laura Kelly beat Trump-aligned Republican Kris Kobach, but lost two other Great Plains races in Oklahoma and South Dakota. In Ohio, Democrats suffered a defeat where Republican Mike DeWine defeated Democrat Richard Cordray. They also lost a chance to take down Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds in Iowa. But in Wisconsin, Democrat Tony Evers has a very narrow lead over Republican Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nMeanwhile, East Coast Republicans like Govs. Larry Hogan (Maryland) and Charlie Baker (Massachusetts) proved resilient in their states, winning comfortably despite Democratic attempts to tie them to Trump. GOP governors in New Hampshire and Vermont won reelection, and Republicans are currently leading in Connecticut, too.\n\nThese governors races are also a first step toward power over redistricting after the next census. Governors elected to four-year terms on Tuesday will be able to sign or veto congressional and state legislative maps in many states in 2021 and 2022.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/1126/1155968404_5857425402001_5857421155001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nGillum concedes in Florida\n\nDemocrats were left disappointed in Florida, after Andrew Gillum conceded the gubernatorial race to former GOP Rep.

The former vice president has spent the past week crisscrossing the country campaigning for Democratic candidates in Tuesday\u2019s elections.

But when an MSNBC reporter asked him if that were the case, Biden demurred and said he had been asked to make appearances for his fellow Democrats.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

He met me at the plane when I arrived, spoke at the great Rally, & stayed to the very end. In fact, I said goodbye to him and left before he did. Deception!\u201d\n\nThe president did not explain where he had heard the rumor, though \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d one of the president\u2019s favorite shows, claimed that Hawley did not stick around for the rally\u2019s entirety.\n\n\u201cWhy Josh Hawley didn't stay last night for the Missouri rally is beyond me,\u201d host Brian Kilmeade said near the top of the show in an explanation of how passionate Trump rallygoers are. \u201cWhat could he have been doing that was so important?\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Hawley on Tuesday also disputed that Hawley left the rally early, saying that Hawley accompanied both Trump before, during and after the event.\n\nHawley is running against Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in what the GOP is eyeing as one of its prime pickup opportunities of the cycle, after Trump won the state by 18 points in 2016. POLITICO rates the race as a toss-up.\n\nOn Tuesday Hawley retweeted the president's message, claiming that McCaskill's campaign was employing \"desperation & dirty tricks to the end.\"\n\n", "As we head into the midterms, it seems like our full attention is focused on which party will win control of the House and Senate. But let\u2019s not overlook some of the other issues on state ballots this year\u2014from minimum wage increases in Arkansas and Missouri to recreational marijuana legalization in Michigan and North Dakota.\n\nStatewide initiatives are the closest thing we have in the United States to direct democracy, but they\u2019re also one of the biggest targets of influence spending. Billionaire Democrat and environmental advocate Tom Steyer has poured millions into campaigns to increase the renewable energy mandates in Arizona and Nevada, for example, while opposition to California\u2019s Proposition 8, which would cap revenue at the state\u2019s dialysis clinics, hit a ballot initiative fundraising record of $111 million.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn total, there are 155 initiatives across 37 states on the ballot on Tuesday. Here are five of the most interesting ones:\n\nA step toward state bans on abortion\n\nIn Alabama and West Virginia, voters will have the chance to amend their respective state constitutions to restrict abortion rights. West Virginia\u2019s proposition would explicitly not protect the right to abortion or state funding of the procedure, while Alabama\u2019s proposition would go one step further by giving rights to fetuses, or, as the proposition states, \u201cunborn children.\u201d\n\nMany believe there\u2019s an explicit strategy here. With the recent confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, anti-abortion advocates are looking forward to the possibility that the court will overturn Roe v. Wade. While these ballot initiatives can\u2019t legally ban abortion while Roe stands, they will, if approved, pave the way for Alabama and West Virginia to constitutionally do so should Roe be overturned. \u201cThey\u2019re setting the stage for if and when Roe falls,\u201d West Virginia abortion rights activist Margaret Chapman Pomponio told Politico this summer. Meanwhile, Oregon voters will also decide whether to prohibit the use of public funds (such as for Medicaid recipients or public employees) for abortions, though recent polling suggests that initiative will fail. There are no polls for Alabama or West Virginia\u2019s ballot initiatives.\n\nThe first state carbon tax\n\nWashington could become the first state in the nation to adopt a price on carbon dioxide emissions as the state\u2019s voters decide the fate of Initiative Measure No. 1631 (I-1631). The battle over I-1631 has shown just how difficult it is to gain broad support for carbon pricing policy. Two years ago, Washington voters turned down a similar ballot initiative. That 2016 measure, I-732, was designed to be a \u201crevenue neutral\u201d tax\u2014meaning, funds received would be returned via tax cuts to those hit hardest by the new tax\u2014in an attempt to gain bipartisan support. But only 1 in 5 Republicans ended up supporting the measure, while it also lost the support of groups like the Sierra Club and others on the left for not doing enough to help poor people and promote clean energy, and it ultimately failed.\n\nThis time, I-1631 has been proposed as a \u201cfee\u201d rather than a \u201ctax\u201d that would start at $15 per ton of carbon dioxide in 2020 and increase by $2 per year (plus inflation) until 2035. Should it go into effect, its revenue would be specifically dedicated to environmental and clean energy projects. Though the opposing sides on I-1631 have fallen along more traditionally partisan lines\u2014Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg have each contributed $1 million in support while BP and Koch Industries have donated millions in opposition\u2014recent polling in the state shows it to be on course to pass. If it does, it won\u2019t make much of a dent in the global climate crisis on its own, but it will be a monumental step forward in state-level action at a time when the president has made it clear that climate change is not a federal policy priority.\n\nA plan to expand rent control\n\nIn California, voters will decide whether to repeal a state law that prevents local governments from imposing many forms of rent control. California has an acute housing affordability crisis, and proponents of Proposition 10 see expanding rent control as a potential solution to that problem. But opponents say that there\u2019s no guarantee more rent control would solve the state\u2019s housing woes, and that it could even worsen the problem by disincentivizing the building of new units.\n\nBut the issue isn\u2019t partisan. A legislative attempt to do the same thing as this measure failed earlier this year in Sacramento, despite California\u2019s Democratic supermajority, and now the proposition has divided the state\u2019s top Democrats: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti supports it, while Lt. Governor and likely soon-to-be-Governor Gavin Newsom warns that it could have \u201cunintended consequences on housing production that could be profoundly problematic.\u201d\n\nThe opposition spending, unsurprisingly, is mostly rooted in a worried renting industry. A landowners association described the proposition as an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d And recent polling suggests the outcome may go their way, with 60 percent of likely voters saying they will vote against.\n\nLetting felons vote again\n\nFlorida is one of four states (along with Iowa, Kentucky and Virginia) in which people with felony convictions are disenfranchised\u2014even after the completion of their sentences\u2014unless they apply directly to the governor to have their voting rights restored. In Florida, however, that could be about to change. With Amendment 4 on the ballot on Tuesday, voters in the Sunshine State could opt to automatically restore the voting rights of people with prior felony convictions (except those convicted of murder or felony sexual offense) who have completed their sentences. That would mean about 1.5 million new voters, expanding Florida\u2019s current voting population by 10 percent. The latest polls show upward of 70 percent of the state\u2019s likely voters support this amendment.\n\nThe 10 Commandments\n\nIt was almost exactly 15 years ago when Roy Moore was removed from the bench as chief justice of Alabama\u2019s Supreme Court for defying a federal court order to remove a 5,280-pound granite monument of the Ten Commandments that he had installed in the state\u2019s judicial building. The federal judges who ordered Moore to remove the monument found that it violated the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause, which prohibits government from favoring any religion over another.\n\nNow, Alabama voters will decide whether to amend the state\u2019s constitution to allow specifically the Ten Commandments to be displayed on government property, including public schools and courthouses. Even if the amendment passes, though there hasn\u2019t been any polling on the initiative, it would likely be challenged in federal court. But proponents told the New York Times in September they look forward to that possibility, hoping that a majority conservative Supreme Court might rule in favor of such religious demonstrations.\n\nRuair\u00ed Arrieta-Kenna is a news assistant at Politico Magazine.", "Facebook suspended 115 accounts believed to be engaged in \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" just before polls opened for Election Day. | Alexander Koerner/Getty Images election cybersecurity Facebook suspends 115 accounts for 'inauthentic behavior' as polls open\n\nFacebook announced late Monday the suspension of 115 accounts it believed to be engaged in \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" as top law enforcement officials warned that Russia may still try to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nThe social media giant said it had opened a probe into the accounts to determine whether they were linked to the Russia-based Internet Research Agency, an organization special counsel Robert Mueller named in a February indictment for allegedly attempting to sway U.S. public opinion.

An unusually large number of House Ways and Means incumbents are in competitive races this year, and several Senate Finance members are in marquee races. Here\u2019s your scorecard for watching the returns.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.): POLITICO\u2019s analysis of competitive races has Roskam\u2019s district in the \u201clean Democrat\u201d category as he fights to hold on against Democrat Sean Casten. Hillary Clinton won the district by 7 points in 2016. Roskam chaired the tax policy subcommittee before taking over the health subcommittee in January.\n\nRep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.): He\u2019s also in a \u201clean Democrat\u201d district, facing off against Democrat Dean Phillips. Paulsen was re-elected in 2016 \u201cdespite President Trump losing his district by a significant margin. But Trump\u2019s numbers there have gotten worse, and Paulsen trailed Democrat Dean Phillips by 9 points in a recent New York Times/Siena College poll,\u201d our race analysts note.\n\nRep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.): Another \u201clean Democrat\u201d race. Democrats consider his challenger, Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA officer and Pentagon official, \"one of the party's top recruits,\u201d our analysis says.\n\nRep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.): Curbelo\u2019s race against Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is a toss-up. Curbelo seemed like a good bet for re-election earlier this year \u2014 he won with 53 percent of the vote in 2016 in a district Clinton carried by 16, our political aces noted. But the candidates are now in a dead heat, polls show.\n\nRep. George Holding (R-N.C.): This is another \u201ctoss-up\u201d race. Though Trump carried the district by 10 points, three recent polls showed Holding neck and neck with Democrat Linda Coleman.\n\nRep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.): POLITICO recently moved this race to \u201clean Republican\u201d from \u201clikely Republican.\u201d \u201cDemocrats will be watching the first returns from this district \u2014 where \u2026 Walorski faces a well-funded Democratic challenger, Mel Hall \u2014 for an early read on the national environment on election night,\u201d our analysts say.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly (R-Pa.): POLITICO also moved this race to \u201clean\u201d from \u201clikely\u201d Republican, noting that Democrats added it to their national target list. PoliticsPA said Kelly\u2019s race against Democrat Ron DiNicola \u201cappears to be a last-breaking sleeper.\u201d\n\nRep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.): POLITICO moved this race to \u201clikely\u201d from \u201clean\u201d Republican. \u201cDemocrats had hoped to knock off GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan, but the six-term incumbent appears to be on more solid ground at the close of the campaign,\u201d our analysts said. Buchanan, who took over the tax policy subcommittee from Roskam, is facing Democrat David Shapiro.\n\nOver at Senate Finance there are fewer seats in play, but they will be crucial to determining the political fate of the chamber:\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.): Her race against Republican Josh Hawley is rated a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d McCaskill is trying to hang on in a state that Trump carried by 19 points.\n\nSen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.): Another \u201ctoss-up\u201d in a state won by Trump, but only by 1.2 percentage points. \u201cThe race between Nelson and [Republican Rick] Scott could set records as the most expensive Senate election of all time,\u201d according to POLITICO\u2019s analysis.\n\nSen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.): The third \u201ctoss-up,\u201d as Heller tries to fend off a challenge from Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. \u201cNevada is the only GOP-held Senate seat up this cycle in a state Hillary Clinton won in 2016,\u201d our experts note.\n\nSen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.): This could be a Republican pick up. POLITICO has moved the race to \u201clean\u201d from \u201clikely\u201d Democrat. \u201cRepublican Bob Hugin continues to pummel \u2026 Menendez over the incumbent\u2019s graft trial last year, which resulted in a mistrial. A series of recent polls pegged Menendez\u2019s lead anywhere between just 2 points, and a more comfortable 11 points.\u201d\n\nWELCOME TO ELECTION DAY!

Introduced in September, the legislation, S. 3432 (115), would require buses to have seat belts in every seat, use technology like automatic emergency braking and electronic stability control, and carry an event data recorder. \u201cWe laud the leadership of Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN) for introducing this lifesaving, commonsense bill and urge Congress to take action on it immediately,\u201d said Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, in a statement. The bill, which is based on recommendations from NTSB, has not advanced in either the House or Senate.\n\n** A message from the Association of American Railroads: What could you do if you had x-ray vision?

Chinese President Xi Jinping is pledging China will import more goods and services over the next 15 years. And the departing Mexican president shares his thoughts on how the NAFTA negotiations went. Let\u2019s dig in:\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE WATCHING IN TONIGHT\u2019S RESULTS: Voters are heading to the polls across the country today to cast ballots in roughly three dozen Senate and gubernatorial races and in House races in every congressional district. The outcomes could dictate how much trade becomes a focus in Congress in several ways:\n\nNAFTA 2.0 on deck: The biggest-ticket item on the legislative agenda next year will be passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, now that lame-duck passage has essentially been ruled out. If Democrats take over the House, they will likely look to leave their mark on the agreement in some way \u2014 perhaps by insisting on changes in the implementing bill to further tighten labor standards.\n\nThey might be loath to hand President Donald Trump a policy victory on one of his top priorities. But U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer\u2019s dedication during talks to keeping in close touch with labor representatives means there\u2019s a lot for Democrats to like in the deal, analysts contend.\n\nNatural allies of Democrats, like prominent environmental groups, have come out against the deal. But voting down NAFTA 2.0 risks economic turmoil \u2014 especially with the 2020 presidential election on the horizon. For a refresher on where House Democrats might be able to work with the White House, including on NAFTA, click here.\n\nNew negotiations: The Trump administration is also looking to move forward on negotiations with the European Union, Japan and the U.K.\n\nIn those negotiations and any others, \u201cadherence to [Trade Promotion Authority] is going to be something that Democrats are going to insist on,\u201d Democratic strategist and lobbyist John Michael Gonzalez told Morning Trade. Gonzalez noted that Democrats have not been shy in the past about making their concerns about ongoing negotiations known even when they were working with a president from their own party.\n\n\u201cIf they weren\u2019t shy about holding President Obama accountable, they\u2019re certainly not going to be shy in holding President Trump accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the Democrats are displeased about how negotiations are going, it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in the White House.\u201d\n\nIT\u2019S TUESDAY, NOV. 6!

He made the comments at the inaugural China International Import Expo, an event created by Beijing to signal its plans to increase trade.\n\nThe pledge to buy more products and services from abroad is \"not a temporary arrangement but a long-term consideration,\" Xi said. China will buy $30 trillion of foreign goods and $10 trillion of foreign services over the next 15 years; it will also open up its health care, education, financial services, telecommunications and mining sectors to foreign investors, Xi said.\n\nXi said \u201cthe right things,\u201d Erin Ennis, vice president at the U.S.-China Business Council, told Morning Trade. \u201cBut we need to see implementation for it to address business concerns.\u201d Click here to read the full story from our partners at the South China Morning Post.\n\nFact-check: Caixin Media, an independent business news publication, crunched the numbers and found that based on current import data, China will be able to meet Xi\u2019s goals by hardly doing a thing.\n\nBeijing imported $1.84 trillion in goods last year, so it would import about $27.6 trillion over the next 15 years even if imports do not increase at all. But Caixin warns that\u2019s a conservative estimate: Goods imports jumped nearly 16 percent from 2016 to 2017 alone.\n\nIRAN VOWS TO BREAK NEW U.S. SANCTIONS: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani pledged Monday that his country would not buckle under the weight of fresh U.S. sanctions on its oil and banking sectors. Iran will \u201cproudly break the sanctions\u201d that went into effect at midnight as a result of Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, Rouhani said in a televised address.\n\nALUMINUM GROUPS CALL FOR REPEAL OF TARIFFS: North American aluminum associations joined forces to call on Trump to remove his tariffs on aluminum from Canada and Mexico before the three countries sign a new trade agreement by the end of the month. The appeal came in a letter to leaders of the three countries, as well as Mexican President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. \u201cThe USMCA cannot work for the aluminum industry or our many downstream customers without exempting Canada and Mexico from the 232 tariffs or quotas,\u201d they said.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S SEPTEMBER TARIFF TOLL HITS $1.4B: U.S. companies paid an estimated $1.4 billion in additional duties in September on steel, aluminum and a wide array of Chinese goods as a result of actions taken by Trump, according to a new analysis by Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, an anti-tariff advocacy group.\n\nImporters paid $1.8 billion in tariffs on products hit by Trump\u2019s tariffs during September, compared with a mere $393 million in the same month last year. That was despite an 11 percent decline in the value of imports, the group said.\n\nA number likely to rise: The latest figures don\u2019t reflect the 10 percent tariff the administration imposed on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 24, a group spokesman, former Rep. Charles Boustany, said in a statement. Those duties will rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1.\n\nPE\u00d1A NIETO\u2019S PERSPECTIVE ON NAFTA TALKS: Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto and other officials showered each other with high praise on Monday for successfully reaching a new North American trade pact.

He added that some of those tense moments have been discussed publicly or leaked to the media, but others will remain secret. \u201cThis whole process was loaded with many episodes \u2014 a lot more than what you\u2019d imagine,\u201d he said.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 The Trump administration's highest-ranking private sector advisory committee has endorsed USMCA and is calling on Congress to approve the deal, POLITICO Pro reports.\n\n\u2014 Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma says the U.S.-China trade war is the \u201cmost stupid thing in the world,\u201d the South China Morning Post reports.\n\n\u2014 U.S. pork exports to Mexico have fallen in value in the face of Mexico's retaliatory tariffs, while European and Canadian pork producers are seizing the opportunity, POLITICO Pro reports.\n\n\u2014 An Ohio retailer is offering a \u201cpre-tariff\u201d sale on appliances and furniture that he says reflects prices before the negative effects of the current trade climate began to set in, the Toledo Blade reports.\n\n\u2014 An EU-Japan trade deal cleared a major procedural hurdle and is on its way to take effect in 2019, VOA reports.\n\n\u2014 China\u2019s vice president says Beijing remains open to discussing a solution on trade with the U.S., Bloomberg reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp, in a tight gubernatorial race, opened an investigation over the weekend after alleging the Democratic Party of Georgia tried to hack into the state voter registration system \u2014 charges that the party and others say are ginned up as a distraction. Kemp\u2019s Democratic opponent Stacey Abrams called it \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d\n\nNow, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has followed suit on its own probe. \u201cThe GBI has been requested by the Secretary of State to investigate allegations of computer crimes related to the Secretary of State's website(s),\u201d the bureau said in a statement Monday to MC. \u201cA criminal investigation will be conducted by the GBI's Georgia Cyber Crime Center.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say that not only is Kemp trying to distract voters, but he also has it wrong. Emails shared by both the Democratic party and Kemp\u2019s office show that a volunteer, Rachel Small, forwarded an email to the party detailing a My Voter page vulnerability or vulnerabilities. Democrats separately shared an email demonstrating that Small was forwarding an email from Richard Wright, a private citizen.\n\nA Democratic party official, Sara Ghazal, then forwarded Small\u2019s email to two Georgia Tech professors, Wenke Lee and Rich DeMillo. Lee serves on a Kemp-created election commission and DeMillo forwarded the email to an attorney for the Coalition for Good Governance, which is suing Georgia over its use of paperless voting machines. That attorney forwarded the email to outside counsel for Kemp\u2019s office. Ghazal said in her email that she feared it was a dangerous vulnerability.\n\nHere\u2019s what Candice Broce, a spokesperson for Kemp, told MC: \u201cWhat we saw in the correspondence was a plan for action and the accompanying computer program to execute the plan.\u201d Broce also said the email aroused her office\u2019s suspicion because Ghazal regularly communicates with the secretary of state team and this time did not share the information directly.\n\nBut the forwarded email from Small does not, by MC\u2019s reading, describe a plan so much as a possibility for anyone with the know-how \u2014 it discusses something that \u201ccan\u201d be done, not something that will or should. All of the email correspondence reviewed by MC shows that those who received forwarded email were either grateful to get the information or neutrally passed it along further.\n\nNonetheless, it was enough for Kemp\u2019s office to open an inquiry. Under Georgia law, \u201cI\u2019m not sure you have to have someone successfully hack a system for it to be a cybercrime, especially when talking about systems like ours\u201d that have an elevated level of priority, Broce said. Georgia\u2019s incumbent governor this summer vetoed legislation opposed by security researchers who said it would make even probing for vulnerabilities illegal.\n\n\u2014 VULNERABILITY OR NAH?: Kemp\u2019s office says there is no vulnerability like the one described in Small\u2019s forwarded email. \u201cBased on the information we have we were not able to recreate or substantiate any of the vulnerabilities he alleged,\u201d Broce said, citing a review that included outside cybersecurity experts. Kemp himself referred to a \u201cpotential vulnerability\u201d on Monday. Other cybersecurity experts who have reviewed the situation have opined that the vulnerability is troublesome, but in at least one case Broce said the story was erroneous, and some of the experts said they did not want to try to test the \u201cworst\u201d vulnerability further for fear of running afoul of cybercrime laws.\n\nLee declined to comment to MC, saying his commission work \u201cdoes not include examining allegations of vulnerabilities in the present system,\u201d and referred questions to DeMillo. \u201cIt's a genuine vulnerability,\u201d DeMillo told MC, who said he assumed Kemp\u2019s office had already learned of the issue by the time he forwarded the email, and pointed to other correspondence showing the FBI had been alerted. DeMillo was confused by Kemp\u2019s response. \u201cThe idea that these URLs that were in the [attached] file would somehow be confused with a script or attack, I don't understand that,\u201d he said.\n\nHAPPY TUESDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

The Kremlin\u2019s influence operations have \u201cevolved since 2016\u201d and the \u201ccontent propagated by these operations has shifted focus from verifiably false information (or \u2018fake news\u2019) to hyperpartisan perspectives.\u201d\n\nMOMENT OF TRUTH FOR SOCIAL MEDIA \u2014 For months, tech companies have touted strides they\u2019ve made since 2016 in their election security efforts \u2014 and that progress is already getting tested as today\u2019s midterms kick off. Late Monday night, Facebook\u2019s Nathaniel Gleicher announced the company was alerted by U.S. law enforcement authorities on Sunday to online activity \u201cthey believe may be linked to foreign entities.\u201d Through a preliminary investigation, the company unearthed 30 accounts on Facebook and 85 on Instagram that \u201cmay be engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d The company could not initially say whether the efforts were tied to the notorious \u201cRussia-based Internet Research Agency or other foreign entities,\u201d Gleicher added.\n\nThough the full extent of the suspected propaganda campaign remains unclear, how U.S. authorities and the company respond to its discovery will offer a glimpse into how far both sides have come since 2016. Earlier Monday, spokesman Andy Stone told Morning Tech that staffers at Facebook HQ are in \u201cdirect contact with the Department of Homeland Security\u201d regarding their efforts to curb misinformation. The federal agency is one of several planning its own \u201cwar room\u201d to tackle election-related issues. Twitter and Reddit, meanwhile, said they\u2019ve also been working closely with DHS, with Twitter adding it\u2019s meeting \u201cregularly\u201d with the agency ahead of Election Day.\n\nCONGRESSMAN HACKED, BUT NOT LIKE THAT \u2014 The campaign Twitter account for the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which plays a big role in cybersecurity-related legislation, got hacked Monday, Twitter confirmed. But the attack on the account of Rep. Frank Pallone doesn\u2019t appear to be politically motivated, the social media company said. The hackers altered Pallone\u2019s site to identify him as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and promote a cryptocurrency giveaway. Pallone\u2019s campaign did not answer requests for comment from MC.\n\nSPAMMERS FIND MORE SUCCESS THAN TRUMP STEAKS \u2014 Spammers are leaning on the Trump brand. Research out Monday from Proofpoint analyzing a month\u2019s worth of spam subject lines focused on politics found that \u201cTrump\u201d appeared nearly five times as often as the next most common term, \u201cDemocrat.\u201d Concluded ProofPoint: \u201cAs we have repeatedly found in recent elections \u2014 and more generally in the spam landscape \u2014 spam actors rely on strong brands to generate clicks.\u201d\n\nWYDEN: PAPER BALLOTS, PLEASE \u2014 Sen. Ron Wyden said it again on Monday: Make paper ballots available to all voters and give them the ability to send in votes by mail. Citing a POLITICO report of voting machine glitches in Georgia and Texas, Wyden urged lawmakers to support the PAVE Act (S. 3049), the bill he introduced to make paper ballots and voting from home the standard on election days. In a statement, he said this election cycle \u201cput a spotlight on the fact that too many voters are stuck with glitchy, insecure voting machines that are hard to use and easy to hack.\u201d So far, the bill has no Republican cosponsors but has the backing of election integrity advocates, and it\u2019s gained momentum after the Secure Elections Act (S. 2593) stalled due to GOP opposition.\n\nFROM FASHION TO ELECTION EQUIPMENT \u2014 Ivanka Trump won initial approval in China for a range of trademarks, including voting machines, a watchdog group revealed Monday. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington raised an eyebrow at the voting machines given the probes into Russian election interference and the president, said spokesman Jordan Libowitz. \u201cA lot of the other things make sense, like Ivanka Trump brand sausages \u2014 there are Jimmy Dean sausages,\u201d Libowitz told MC. \u201cAn Ivanka brand voting machine?\u201d An attorney representing the president\u2019s daughter did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nON THE RIGHT TRACK \u2014 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is improving its cybersecurity posture across the board but still needs to define its risk tolerance level and improve its mobile device patching process, according to a new audit by the inspector general of the Federal Reserve System, which houses the CFPB. The report also warned the CFPB to restrict access to an internal software platform that contained personally identifiable information, and it recommended changes to how the agency protects its databases and fixes vulnerabilities. The CFPB\u2019s chief information officer agreed with auditors\u2019 recommendations and pledged to implement them.\n\nAuditors had an equally positive review of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors, which they described as operating at a \u201cmanaged and measurable\u201d level of cybersecurity maturity. But like its assessment of the CFPB, the IG\u2019s office dinged the Fed for a \u201clack of an agencywide risk management governance structure and strategy,\u201d saying, \u201cseveral security processes, such as asset management and enterprise architecture, have not yet been implemented agencywide.\u201d It noted that the board of governors had fixed four of the 13 recommendations from the IG\u2019s 2017 audit. In addition to the remaining nine recommendations, the IG added six new ones covering risk management and security training.\n\nSHARING IS CARING \u2014 U.S. Cyber Command's Cyber Mission Force posted its first malware sample to VirusTotal, a Google-owned malware intelligence database. \u201cRecognizing the value of collaboration with the public sector, the CNMF has initiated an effort to share unclassified malware samples it has discovered that it believes will have the greatest impact on improving global cybersecurity,\u201d Cyber Command said in a statement Monday.\n\nMORE \u2018HACK THE\u2019 \u2014 The Air Force is ready to be hacked again, on purpose. HackerOne is its teammate once more for the bug bounty initiative \u201cHack the Air Force 3.0.\u201d That\u2019s the biggest number of hacking events for a part of the military, and 191 countries are now eligible to participate, more than ever before.

Here are a few of our takeaways:\n\nGreater risk to kids: Poor EHR design can lead to medication errors, which can be especially detrimental for children whose body weights are lower and whose immune systems aren\u2019t as developed as adults\u2019. In more than a third of pediatric patient safety events involving EHRs and medication, the technology\u2019s \u201cusability\u201d contributed to medication errors, according to one study.\n\nFor instance, one physician ordered five times the recommended dosage without getting an alert from the EHR, researchers found.\n\nIn about a fifth of those cases, the mistake \u2014 which could result in improper dosage or incorrect prescriptions \u2014 actually reached the patient, sometimes leading to temporary harm, according to the analysis of 9,000 safety reports.\n\nRaj Ratwani \u2014 director of the National Center for Human Factors in Healthcare at MedStar Health and the study's lead author \u2014 has urged ONC to publish a draft of a voluntary certification for EHRs used in pediatric settings; the 21st Century Cures Act directs ONC to create those criteria.\n\nResearchers also argued that Congress should conduct oversight into ONC\u2019s plan to create an EHR reporting program that could help customers compare products, ensuring that the agency is prioritizing patient safety.\n\n\u2014Why health systems should just ask patients what went wrong: Perhaps unsurprisingly, patient feedback can help physicians better understand their mistakes, researchers concluded in another study. After examining almost 200 patient narratives describing diagnostic error, researchers found 224 mentions of interpersonal and behavioral factors that could have contributed to the error \u2014 doctors ignoring patient knowledge or disrespecting patients, for instance.\n\nHealth systems have a rigorous process for analyzing diagnostic error, but it doesn\u2019t often involve the patient\u2019s own experience, said lead author Traber Giardina, a researcher at the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety.\n\nGiardina told Morning eHealth that hospital systems should establish an IT system that can gather patient feedback in a way patients feel is convenient, such as a mobile app.\n\n\u201cRight now, there are no good ways to get data electronically from patients except maybe patient experience surveys,\u201d said Hardeep Singh, a researcher and medical professor at Baylor University.\n\nOnce health systems gather more patient narratives, they could use natural language processing and sentiment analysis to quickly look for factors that could have led to diagnostic error, Singh added.\n\nThere might even be hints about diagnostic error buried within common patient complaints about parking, temperature and food, Singh said. \u201cIn their narrative, did they really talk about a misdiagnosis?\u201d\n\nReal-time warnings: Researchers have piloted a way of monitoring EHRs to detect safety risks to hospitalized patients in real time. Pascal Metrics says it is the first organization to apply machine learning to a dataset of EHR-based adverse event outcomes.\n\nThe system, which Pascal tested at two community hospitals, can detect patient harm from real-time data and fires triggers that result in patient safety monitoring.\n\n\"This appears to be a genuine pivot away from retrospective reviews of patient safety incidents to real-time analysis,\" said Jeff Smith, vice president for public policy at the American Medical Informatics Association.\n\nWhile the study demonstrates the potential for use of real-time data, there were many false positives triggered by the system, noted Dean Sittig, a professor of bioinformatics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston.\n\nUntil EHR systems become capable of limiting these false alarms, \"systems like these will be untenable for all but the highest-staffed facilities,\" Sittig said.

But how will the immigration tough talk play out? Here are some races to watch:\n\nThe \u2018immigration reducers\u2019: Nonprofit NumbersUSA, which advocates for reduced levels of immigration, published a list of House races it\u2019s watching. The lawmakers with \u201ctop immigration reduction ratings\u201d in competitive campaigns include Reps. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), Pete Sessions (R-Texas) and Dave Brat (R-Va.).\n\nThe Trump allies: A number of politicians with ties to Trump\u2019s immigration agenda will also face competitive races today. They include Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), who is running for the Senate seat held by Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.). Another hard-liner to watch will be Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican running in a three-way race for governor.\n\nEyes on Pennsylvania and Colorado: Pro-migrant group Immigration Hub circulated a midterm analysis Monday that argued Pennsylvania and Colorado will be the states to watch today. \u201cPresident Trump desperately wanted to win Pennsylvania, as indicated by the eight trips he and Vice President Mike Pence made to the state,\u201d they wrote in a brief for reporters.\n\nUNIONS\n\nEXCLUSIVE: AFL-CIO DROPS 3M MAILERS: Over the final three weeks in the run-up to the midterms, the AFL-CIO says it dropped some 3 million direct mail pieces targeting 24 states. The effort boosts labor-backed candidates such as Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania, Beto O\u2019Rourke in Texas, Amy McGrath in Kentucky, among other candidates in key swing districts. \u201cMembership polling this cycle has found that persuadable voters trust their unions more than any other source of political information,\u201d according to the AFL-CIO.\n\nAnd its effort could pay off. In Ohio, about half of union households that voted for Trump in 2016 said they\u2019re backing Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown and Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Richard Cordray, according to the AFL-CIO, which polled over 15,000 of its members in the state. (More on that from Vox here.)\n\nThe Communications Workers of America also say it\u2019s running four ongoing text banks in Ohio that are focusing on Brown and Cordray. POLITICO\u2019s analysis suggests Brown\u2019s seat is a safe bet for Democrats. And RealClearPolitics\u2019 polling average has Cordray up nearly 5 points.\n\nMeanwhile, the Culinary Workers Union in Las Vegas has registered 10,300 new voters since the last election, the Huffington Post reports. It's also \"helped more than 650 immigrants in Nevada become citizens this year alone.\" More on that here.\n\nCORPORATE CIVICS CLASS: Corporate giants including Walmart, Tyson Foods, Levi Strauss and hundreds of other companies are offering paid time off so their employees can make it to the ballot box today, Jennifer Saba reports for The New York Times.\n\n\u201cA jumble of state laws and the lack of a national holiday will make voting a challenge for many workers,\u201d Saba writes, because federal law sets Election Day on the first Tuesday of November for national elections, smack dab in the middle of the workweek. \u201cMore than 370 companies have signed on to the Make Time to Vote initiative,\u201d Saba reports. \u201cThey are easing the path in various ways, including giving employees paid time off to vote on Nov. 6.\u201d More here.\n\nDACA TO SCOTUS: The Justice Department on Monday petitioned the Supreme Court to intervene in several cases over the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, POLITICO\u2019s Ted Hesson reports.\n\nThe request comes as Trump has been hurling weeks of fiery anti-immigration rhetoric in a bid to reach GOP voters, for whom immigration is a top concern. DOJ asked that the Supreme Court review three federal judges\u2019 rulings blocking Trump\u2019s plan to end the program, which grants work permits for and prevents the deportation of roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. More here.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN AD PULLED: NBC, Fox and Facebook all said Monday they would no longer play an ad from Trump's reelection campaign that ties Central American migrants seeking asylum to an undocumented immigrant who was convicted of killing two Sacramento sheriff's deputies in 2014, POLITICO\u2019s Matthew Choi reports.\n\n\"After further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\" a NBCUniversal spokesperson said Monday. CNN had already declined to air the ad, calling it \u201cracist.\u201d\n\n\"We have a lot of ads,\u201d Trump said to reporters Monday, \u201cand they certainly are effective based on the numbers that we're seeing.\" Asked if the ad in question was offensive, he replied: \"Well, a lot of things are offensive.\" More here.\n\nCoffee Break\n\n\u2014 \u201cAmazon Plans to Split HQ2 Evenly Between Two Cities,\u201d from The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u2014 \u201cCrazy Work Hours and Lots of Cameras: Silicon Valley Goes to China,\u201d from The New York Times\n\n\u2014 \u201cDid Scott Walker and Donald Trump Deal Away the Wisconsin Governor\u2019s Race to Foxconn?\u201d from The New Yorker\n\n\u2014 \u201cTheir Soybeans Piling Up, Farmers Hope Trade War Ends Before Beans Rot,\u201d from The New York Times\n\n\u2014 \u201cHeading into the midterms, there\u2019s still no evidence that the TCJA is working as promised,\u201d from the Economic Policy Institute\n\n\u2014 \u201cUnder Armour\u2019s #MeToo Moment: No More Strip Clubs on Company Dime,\u201d from The Wall Street Journal\n\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MORNING SHIFT.\n\n** A message from the Society for Human Resource Management \u2013 SHRM, the voice of all things work: The world of work is rapidly changing \u2013 and America is counting on Congress to back policies that deliver for employees, employers and the entire economy.\n\n\u201cWork\u201d is more flexible than ever, so workplace rules need to be too.

So we\u2019re taking an early look at Minnesota Democrat Collin Peterson\u2019s record.\n\n\u2014 MA\u2019s 5 farm-state races to watch: Competitive contests in agricultural states and districts will likely play a decisive role in determining control of both chambers of Congress.\n\n\u2014 The heartland\u2019s loyalty to President Donald Trump will be put to the test. Trade turmoil, and its impact on farmers and manufacturers, might drive some voters\u2019 decisions. The lapsed farm bill? Not so much.\n\n\u2014 Commodity groups favored Republicans with their 2018 campaign donations this cycle. A top political finance tracker follows the money from crop processors, the sugar sector, livestock producers and other ag groups.\n\nAG\u2019S SAFE HAVEN IN A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE: If the chamber flips today, Collin Peterson is likely to be agriculture\u2019s shelter from the effects of the \u201cblue wave.\u201d The Minnesota Democrat is widely expected to return as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, a post he previously held from 2007 until 2011.\n\nIf the blue wave is real: Polls suggest Democrats are likely to take the House (if one trusts polls these days). If that happens, portions of the agriculture industry could end up at odds with the new majority on a range of issues, from the Waters of the U.S. rule to taxes. But under a centrist like Peterson, House Ag would be seen as a safe haven amid a more liberal caucus, reports our Helena Bottemiller Evich this morning.\n\n\u201cMost of agriculture views Collin Peterson as a friend,\u201d said Andrew Walmsley, the American Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s director of congressional relations. \u201cIf you have to work with anyone in Congress, he\u2019s one of the better ones.\u201d\n\nPeterson has proven to be a centrist in nearly three decades on Capitol Hill. He\u2019s the most conservative Democrat in the House. He\u2019s voted more often with Trump than he ever did with former President Barack Obama. And agriculture interests are familiar with him \u2014 he\u2019s a known commodity, unlike so many suburban and urban Democrats.\n\nA closer fight than expected? For most of this year, Peterson\u2019s rematch against Air Force veteran and drone pilot Dave Hughes hasn\u2019t gotten much national attention, under the assumption that Peterson will win another term representing Minnesota\u2019s 7th District.\n\nOver the weekend some local reports indicated the race has tightened, but it appears Peterson still enjoys a substantial lead. Polling site FiveThirtyEight gives him a 93 percent chance of winning.\n\nPros, read Helena\u2019s full story here.\n\nBOOKMARK THESE PAGES: POLITICO has you covered all Election Day and night with results and analysis, right here.

Here are five races we\u2019re tracking today, from the soybean belt to California\u2019s Central Valley:\n\n\u2014 North Dakota Senate: In this marquee race, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp faces an uphill battle against GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer. Heitkamp, widely considered the most vulnerable Democrat this cycle, has focused heavily on the plight of the state\u2019s soybean sector and criticized Trump\u2019s trade tactics. North Dakota soybean growers have been burned by retaliatory tariffs as badly as any group in the country.\n\n\u2014 California House District 10: The toss-up race between Republican Rep. Jeff Denham and Democrat Josh Harder is one of several competitive contests based in the Central Valley farmlands, where the politics of agriculture, water and immigration reign.\n\n\u2014 Mississippi (Special) Senate: There\u2019s a four-way race to fill the seat of former Sen. Thad Cochran, and the leading Democratic candidate is former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. The contest is likely headed to a runoff, unless one candidate clears 50 percent. Espy\u2019s performance in the deep-red state will help measure the power of any blue wave.\n\n\u2014 Minnesota House Districts 1 and 8: Two House Agriculture Democrats from rural Minnesota are leaving Congress, offering the GOP two of their best House pickup opportunities. Republicans Jim Hagedorn and Pete Stauber are seen as more likely than not to flip the open seats. Both districts backed Trump two years ago.\n\n*Bonus races* to watch: Organic farmer and Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seen as a slight favorite to win reelection in Montana. In Indiana, where GOP businessman Mike Braun is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, Trump has made late-in-the-game visits in his effort to bolster the GOP\u2019s chances of holding the Senate.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s really about the candidate, but if they want to give me the credit or the liability, I\u2019ll be willing to take it,\u201d Trump said Monday about the stakes in the Indiana race after arriving in Fort Wayne ahead of a campaign rally.\n\nWe\u2019re also keeping tabs on toss-up governor\u2019s races in states with major ag interests: Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nFor more: Pro DataPoint has all the races to watch today in farm states and beyond.

Learn more.\n\nPOLITICO Pro DataPoint\n\nTRADE FALLOUT PUT TO THE TEST: There\u2019s been no shortage of headlines and speculation about political repercussions from the trade war and its effects on farmers and manufacturers. In each of the races we highlighted above (and plenty of others), voters will finally make clear that they are truly sticking with the president \u2014 or punishing him for their trade woes.\n\n\u2014 Widespread impact: Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum duties and other nations\u2019 retaliatory tariffs have dented commodity prices and driven up farm costs like chemicals and equipment.\n\n\u2014 But, but, but: There are few indicators that the trade turmoil will drive Trump voters away from the GOP and into the Democratic column.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? The farm bill lapsed? Despite all the talk from House and Senate leaders this year about the importance of finishing a new farm bill by Oct. 1, their failure to pass a final measure before the 2014 law expired seems to have barely registered in farm-state midterm races.\n\n\u2014 The farm bill expiration did crop up in a handful of House races in Iowa, Illinois and elsewhere, but it\u2019s been totally overshadowed by the trade war fallout.\n\n\u2014 The lack of campaign attention on the farm bill is also because farmers and ranchers mostly won\u2019t notice the effects of the 2014 measure\u2019s expiration until after December \u2014 and because there\u2019s some expectation (or hope) that a final agreement might come together by then.\n\n** A message from AGree: The time is now to fully fund the Farm Bill conservation title and to pass the improved agricultural data management and analysis policies included in the Senate-passed Farm Bill. These policies will unlock solutions to conserve natural resources and reduce risk and improve profitability. Learn more here. **\n\nAG INDUSTRY 2018 DONATIONS FAVOR GOP: Pro Ag\u2019s Liz Crampton reported Monday that farm bureaus in the top 10 ag states were spreading their campaign contributions between both parties \u2014 though the GOP received more. The nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance and lobbying, also dug into 2018 spending by agricultural groups and found that crop producers and processors were the biggest donors among ag sectors this election cycle. And Republicans, again, were favored.\n\n\u201cGOP donor support is high in part because major farming operations generally contribute to incumbent politicians in the agriculturally rich districts they are located in, which are represented mostly by Republicans,\u201d CRP wrote in its analysis of the spending data.\n\n\u2014 Crop workers and PACs gave $14.5 million to Republicans this cycle and about $7 million to Democrats. The livestock sector donated $4.3 million to GOP candidates and $1.9 million to Democrats.\n\n\u2014 Sugar cane and sugar beet groups came closest to sharing donations evenly between the two parties. They gave more than $3.4 million to the GOP and $2.8 million to Democrats.\n\n\u2014 Dairy, tobacco, poultry and egg groups gave the least amount in political contributions. They each poured about $2 million to $3 million into campaigns ahead of today\u2019s elections, mostly for Republicans.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 Advisory panel muted on NAFTA 2.0 ag impact: A U.S. advisory committee reviewing the new North American trade pact had little to say about how the deal will affect agriculture. The committee expressed concern about a provision allowing protein powders to be used for animal feed at below market prices. Pro Canada\u2019s Alexander Panetta has more.\n\n\u2014 Retaliatory tariffs dent pork exports to Mexico: The value of U.S. pork exports to Mexico dropped to $1 billion from January through September \u2014 down 8 percent from the same period in 2017, according to USDA data compiled by the U.S. Meat Export Federation. European and Canadian pork producers are filling the gap, Pro Trade\u2019s Sabrina Rodriguez reports.\n\n\u2014 More trade war fallout for soybean growers: Kevin Karel, who operates six grain elevators in North Dakota, is piling one million soybean bushels on open ground behind his jam-packed grain silos. Like soybean farmers and exporters across the U.S., he\u2019s hoping the trade war ends soon, sales to China resume and soybean prices rise \u2014 before the stockpiled crop rots. The New York Times has the dispatch from Arthur, N.D.\n\n\u2014 Trump says he\u2019ll \u2018take a look\u2019 at Zinke accusations: The president offered scant support Monday for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who is under scrutiny for ethical and potentially legal lapses. \u201cCertainly, I would not be happy with that at all,\u201d Trump said, referring to the possible outcome of reported government probes into Zinke\u2019s actions as Interior chief, POLITICO\u2019s Eliana Johnson and Pro Energy\u2019s Zack Colman and Ben Lefebvre report.\n\n\u2014 Crunching the cranberry glut: The cranberry industry has agreed to destroy a quarter of the 2018 crop, hoping to counteract its surplus and boost prices. (Much of last year\u2019s crop is already sitting in storage.)

While education may have played a minor role in most races, the results tonight could have major implications for education policy in the coming year.\n\nWe previewed on Monday some of the potential midterm election fallout for K-12 education issues and federal education funding. Higher education could also see big changes. Here\u2019s what to watch on that front as results start rolling in:\n\n\u2014 The balance of power in Congress: All eyes will be on which party controls the House and Senate for the 116th Congress. Democrats have promised, broadly, to exercise sweeping oversight of the Trump administration if they win committee gavels and subpoena powers in the majority \u2014 and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the Trump administration\u2019s higher education moves are widely seen as prime targets.\n\n\u2014 Democrats have cried foul over what they argue is an Education Department that\u2019s captive to the interests of for-profit education and student loan companies. If they win the majority in either chamber, Democrats will be able to add some teeth to the scathing letters they\u2019ve frequently sent DeVos over those issues during the past two years. Expect a Democrat-led House, for instance, to conduct hearings, demand documents and press the Trump administration on its appointment of officials with ties to for-profit colleges \u2014 and its reversal of Obama-era policies meant to crack down on the industry.\n\n\u2014 Flying under the radar: Democrats also have in their corner a slew of new left-leaning watchdog groups that have cropped up only since the last election \u2014 and that have already been working to put the Education Department on the defensive. Groups like American Oversight, National Student Legal Defense Network and Democracy Forward have all filed multiple lawsuits against the department \u2014 many focusing on its ties to the for-profit education industry \u2014 that could prove to be a useful roadmap for newly empowered Democratic staff. In addition, Democratic attorneys general and consumer groups have forged a more aggressive and cohesive coalition that works on higher education issues since Democrats last controlled the House. They\u2019ve challenged nearly every major DeVos policy move on higher education.\n\n\u2014 Conversely, if Republicans maintain their grip on Congress, it could allow an emboldened Trump administration to forge ahead more smoothly on its ambitious plans to deregulate higher education and scale back federal requirements that it views as impediments to innovation. The White House has also signaled privately to some groups that it may take on a more prominent role in higher education policies in the coming months.\n\n\u2014 At the state level, widespread Democratic wins could also spell more scrutiny for student loan companies in some states. Critics of student loan servicers are gearing up to try to convince more states to pass tighter regulations on the industry in the coming legislative sessions. Those efforts would play out amid the ongoing dispute between some states and the Trump administration over who has the authority to police companies collecting federal student loans.\n\nGOOD TUESDAY MORNING AND WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

The company alleges in a lawsuit, which became public on Monday, that the Education Department's process for selecting companies for its new loan servicing platform has been unfair and violated federal procurement rules.\n\n\u2014 Navient is one of the department's largest existing loan servicers, but it wasn't among the more than a dozen companies that the Trump administration named last month as finalists to receive contracts under its new loan servicing system. The company has said it\u2019s still in the running as a potential subcontractor.\n\n\u2014 The lawsuit accuses the department of \"radically changing\" the scope of the project in the middle of the bidding process, which it says put Navient at a competitive disadvantage. The company said it \"suffered irreparable injury by the loss of the opportunity to compete on a level playing field.\"\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s the latest challenge to DeVos\u2019 plan to overhaul and \u201cmodernize\u201d how the federal government collects student loans. Two other existing federal loan servicers \u2014 FedLoan Servicing, which is operated by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Authority, and the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority \u2014 filed separate protests with GAO last week.

Education Corporation of America, which operates Virginia College and Brightwood College, had asked a federal judge in Alabama to appoint a receiver to oversee its restructuring while also shielding the company from creditors and requiring the Education Department to continue to provide student aid funding to its schools.\n\n\u2014 Federal law permanently bars any company that files for bankruptcy protection from ever receiving federal student aid funding. ECA argued that it needed the court\u2019s help to make sure it would continue accessing federal student aid while it attempts to restructure itself.\n\n\u2014 But the judge sided with the Education Department and DeVos, who were named as defendants in the company\u2019s lawsuits and sought to dismiss the case. U.S. District Judge Abdul K. Kallon ruled that the for-profit college chain did not have standing to bring the case because it wasn\u2019t alleging an actual or immediate injury. He didn\u2019t rule on the merits of its case.\n\n\u2014 The lawsuit, which describes the company\u2019s financial situation as dire, has also triggered a sanction from its accreditor. The Accrediting Council on Independent Colleges and Schools said last week that the company must demonstrate why it shouldn\u2019t remove approval for its Virginia College chain in light of its financial instability.\n\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS\n\n\u2014 Henry Duvall, director of communications at the Council of the Great City Schools for the past 26 years, will retire in January.\n\n\u2014 Beth Stein, who previously was general counsel and chief oversight counsel for Sen.

'Reagan County' RACES down to the wire -- TECH pushes back on H1-B visa policies -- KAMALA RISING in 2020 polls Presented by California Resources Corporation\n\nTHE BUZZ: Whether or not California propels a blue wave election on Tuesday, Monday night marked a certain sea change in state politics: Jerry Brown's final campaign event as governor.\n\n-- Appearing on a stage with Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom for the first time since June, Brown encouraged voters at an election-eve gathering in San Francisco to lift Newsom into the office Brown is preparing to vacate at the end of four terms spanning the better part of four decades. Sen. Kamala Harris was also on hand, capping a final statewide swing with Newsom that marshaled their joint clout on behalf of Democrats up and down the state.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n-- True to form, Brown opened with a history lesson, noting that a Newsom victory would be the first Democrat-to-Democrat handoff of California governors in more than a century. A recurring rule of politics is that \u201cpeople get a little tired of you,\u201d Brown mused, but \u201cluckily we\u2019re going from the oldest governor to one that\u2019s pretty young,\u201d which he said would \u201cfreshen up the process.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThings are really screwed up\u201d in the world, Brown, 80, said. He noted the global authoritarian lurch of governments from Hungary to the Philippines to Brazil \u2014 but also said, \u201cIf you look at some of our red states \u2014 craaazy.\u201d But while President Donald Trump governs by wielding fear, Brown said, \u201cGavin\u2019s about vision, boldness and getting stuff done,\u201d praising him as \u201cenergetic\u201d and \u201cvisionary.\u201d His reference to a future Newsom presidential run got the most sustained applause of the night \u2014 but Brown still worked in a wink.\n\n-- QUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201cI\u2019ll be watching from the ranch,\u201d Brown noted, but \u201cI\u2019m only an hour from Sacramento, so Gavin, do not screw up.\u201d\n\n-- TWEET OF THE DAY: Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg @DarrellSteinberg -- \u201cWe may have to wait longer for results in #CA , but I\u2019m proud of the fact that we make it easy for all eligible #voters to exercise their democratic right and responsibility. #SacVote #MoreDaysMoreWays #Vote2018 twitter.com/kyamamura/stat\u2026\n\n-- PODCASTS OF THE DAY: Former Gov.

REAGAN COUNTRY RACES: Ronald Reagan once called Orange County, the storied conservative bastion, \u201cthe place good Republicans go to die.\u201d And this year, with demographic shifts and the effects of a controversial presidency, it could happen, politically speaking. The majority of those famed seven targeted House races in districts held by RepublIcans and won in 2016 by Hillary Clinton are in the O.C. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Huntington Beach is in the fight for his life against Democrat Harley Rouda in CA-48. Rep. Mimi Walters of Irvine has faced a beat-down from UC Irvine law professor and consumer advocate Katie Porter in CA-45. Democrats are considered likely to pick up CA-49, where Democrat Mike Levin leads Republican Diane Harkey in the race to succeed retiring Rep. Darrell Issa. The race in CA-39, where Rep. Ed Royce is retiring, is closer, with Republican Young Kim and. Democrat Gil Cisneros running neck-and-neck. Farther north of LA, don\u2019t forget CA-25\u2019s nail-biter between Rep. Steve Knight, challenged by Dem Katie Hill . Control of the House runs through the O.C.; all eyes will be here Tuesday night.\n\n2. ROADS AND HOMES: There\u2019s plenty to analyze on a crowded ballot initiative slate, but Propositions 6 and 10 stand out as big-money political signposts. In seeking to repeal a 12-cents-a-gallon gas tax, Prop. 6 directly tests the supremacy of two opposing political forces: on one side the state\u2019s Democratic-dominated government, with legislative Democrats using two-thirds majorities to send Brown a legacy accomplishment that he\u2019s spent his final campaign cycle defending; and on the other the state\u2019s shriveled Republican electorate, which GOP officials hope to galvanize with an anti-tax revolt. And Prop. 10 reflects the ubiquity of a housing affordability crisis that dominates California politics. It also tests the strength of an ascendant build-baby-build emphasis that\u2019s been embraced by Newsom, who\u2019s defied much of the liberal base by opposing Prop. 10 and saying it would chill development.\n\n3. STEVE POIZNER AND \u201cTHE RISE OF THE INDEPENDENTS\u201d: If Steve Poizner grabs the brass ring to become California\u2019s state insurance commissioner, he could signal a new trend heading toward 2020. Poizner, the former GOP gubernatorial candidate who has since abandoned the party, won 24 of 24 statewide newspaper endorsements in this bid, shellacking Democratic state Sen. Ricardo Lara on that front. If he manages to jump the hurdle of Democrats\u2019 19-point registration advantage over the GOP, Poizner will be seen as a harbinger for more moderate Republicans who want a path to victory away from Trump in 2020. And then watch Poizner, a wealthy tech executive, become subject of buzz about what office he might seek next.\n\n4. A BLUE TSUNAMI? HERE'S THE KEY: Look to the fate of GOP Reps. Duncan Hunter and Devin Nunes, who have previously coasted to reelection in two of the state\u2019s most loyal GOP districts. But CA-50\u2019s Hunter, indicted on 60 counts related to fraud and campaign finance violations, met a surprisingly strong challenge from Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, and responded with ads condemned as anti-Muslim. ( Here\u2019s the LATimes rundown. ) And CA-22\u2019s Nunes was relentlessly targeted by Fresno prosecutor Andrew Janz, (here\u2019s RealClearPolitics\u2019 take ) who turned out big crowds, raised millions of dollars and hit thousands of homes in an effort to unseat the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. If both challengers succeed, then Republicans nationwide probably already know they're deep, deep trouble.\n\n5. THE STEYER EFFECT: The billionaire California Democratic activist has roamed the country this year, hammering home his message and collecting 6 million signatures for his NeedtoImpeach.com. But a main goal: focusing heavily on younger voters, who failed to turn out in the 2016 election.

White @JeremyBWhite\n\n\n\nPOLITICO California @politicoca", "Sean Hannity\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump has put him under the microscope of media watchers who have accused Fox News of being too friendly with the White House. | Carolyn Kaster/AP photo media Fox News raps Hannity for appearing onstage at Trump rally The Fox News host said he was unaware he would be invited on stage, but the White House had billed him as a \"special guest.\"\n\nFox News censured its biggest star Tuesday, saying that Sean Hannity should not have appeared onstage a night earlier with President Donald Trump at his final campaign rally before the midterm elections.\n\nHannity\u2019s cameo appearance Monday in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, directly contradicted a pledge he had made hours earlier not to take the stage with the president. It also contradicted assurances from network brass that, despite a Trump campaign press release touting Hannity\u2019s appearance as part of the rally, he would not be a guest of the president's.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe incident revealed a network struggling to reign in its biggest star, who has flaunted the independence that comes with sky-high ratings and privileged status inside Fox News. Fellow host Jeanine Pirro also appeared on stage with the president Monday.\n\n\u201cFOX News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events,\u201d a Fox News spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear how Fox News addressed the incident with its hosts.\n\nWhile Hannity has traveled to Trump rallies plenty of times to host his show on-site and interview the president, questions about his role at the Missouri rally stemmed from the White House. In an email sent out before the rally, the White House billed Hannity as a \u201cspecial guest\u201d along with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and musician Lee Greenwood.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHannity replied on Twitter that \u201cI will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally. To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President. I am covering [the] final rally for my show. Something I have done in every election in the past.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, after interviewing Trump live for his show, Hannity was called onstage by the president, to raucous applause. The host promptly pointed to the media members assembled in the back of the room \u2014 which included Fox News staff \u2014 labeling them \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nHannity said in his comments that he had been unaware he would be invited onstage, but he spoke briefly about the president\u2019s accomplishments and repeated Trump\u2019s 2020 reelection slogan, \u201cPromises made, promises kept.\u201d\n\nPirro, whose show the president has regularly praised, was also called by Trump up to the stage, where she urged the crowd to vote for Republicans.\n\nHannity claimed on Twitter Tuesday that he had not misrepresented his plans: \u201cWhat I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful. When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president\u2019s request. This was NOT planned.\"\n\nWhat I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful. When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president\u2019s request. This was NOT planned. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 6, 2018\n\nHe also sought to do clean-up on his \"fake news\" crack.\n\n\"To be clear, I was not referring to my journalist colleagues at FOX News in those remarks,\" Hannity wrote. \"They do amazing work day in and day out in a fair and balanced way and it is an honor to work with such great professionals.\u201d\n\nBut Hannity\u2019s performance Monday night upset some current and former Fox News employees, particularly because he didn't exempt his coworkers from his shot at the media. Reporter Kristin Fisher was covering the rally for the network.\n\n\u201cI think it was the fake news swipe that teed off a lot of people,\" said one former Fox News employee, saying that by Tuesday morning, five former colleagues who are still at the network had been in touch about the incident. \u201cThe shot at the media, he does that every night on his show. There\u2019s nothing new about that. What does change it is his colleagues were back there.\u201d\n\nFox News often labors to distinguish between its opinion hosts, who almost universally support Trump, and its news division, which the network says works as objectively as any other.\n\nBut another former Fox News employee, who worked in the company\u2019s news division, said this type of incident makes reporters' jobs more difficult because it makes the network seem too close to the White House.\n\nDuring Fox News\u2019 11 p.m. newscast, when anchor Shannon Bream went to Fisher to report on the rally, Fisher cited Hannity\u2019s interview with Trump but did not mention his comments on stage.\n\nTrump\u2019s relationship with Fox News has long been tight and has only grown more snug throughout his presidency. Hannity is known to be one of Trump\u2019s top advisers, speaking with the president frequently. And there has been a highway between the network and the White House, with officials such as White House communications chief Bill Shine, top State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert and national security adviser John Bolton all having previously worked at the network. Nauert is viewed as a leading contender to replace Nikki Haley as UN ambassador.\n\nTrump\u2019s interview with Hannity on Monday night marked his 38th on the network\u2019s air since taking office, far more than any other network, according to a POLITICO count. In second place is CBS News, with four Trump interviews. Trump also frequently tweets about shows on the network, sometimes appearing to tweet commentary in real time, and on Monday, he told Hannity that he never misses the primetime show\u2019s opening monologue.\n\nHannity\u2019s friendship with Trump had previously gotten him in trouble with his employer for pushing the limits of his role as an opinion commentator. He was reprimanded by Fox in 2016 after he appeared in a campaign video endorsing Trump.\n\nIn 2010, the Fox host arranged to broadcast his show as part of a Tea Party rally in Cincinnati, with proceeds of his appearance to go to the local Tea Party group. Fox News executives, who had been caught unaware by Hannity\u2019s plans, barred him from appearing and called the host back to New York.\n\nA Los Angeles Times story at the time quoted Shine, then the network\u2019s executive vice president of programming, as saying, \u201cFox News never agreed to allow the Cincinnati Tea Party organizers to use Sean Hannity\u2019s television program to profit from broadcasting his show from the event. When senior executives in New York were made aware of this, we changed our plans for tonight\u2019s show.\u201d\n\nThe incident doesn't seem to have damaged their relationship permanently. According to a pool report, after his interview with Trump Monday night, Hannity fist-bumped Shine.\n\n", "WILL REPUBLICANS HOLD THE HOUSE? -- What a Dem win means for Trump -- 36M VOTE EARLY -- How Dems got free rent\n\nBy Nolan D.

POLITICO will have the latest results with updating House and Senate maps throughout the night, as well as live analysis \u2014 I\u2019ll be on from 6 to 6:30 p.m. taking your questions and talking about the biggest races.\n\nTHE BUZZ\n\n11 questions for the day:\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n1. What are the most important races to watch? All the congressional contests, of course, because their outcomes could determine whether Democrats gain control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Specifically, watch the 6th and 14th Districts. Incumbent Rep. Randy Hultgren (14th) is in a race for his life against Democrat Lauren Underwood. Hultgren is a low-key Republican who\u2019s run a low-key race. Maybe it worked in years\u2019 past but this time he faces an energetic woman in an election year when women are posting historic gains. Underwood has out-raised and out-spent Hultgren and it shows in the polls.\n\nSimilarly, Rep. Peter Roskam is in a battle with Dem challenger Sean Casten in the 6th District, which Hillary Clinton won by seven points in 2016.\n\n2. What\u2019s the outlook for the governor\u2019s race? Internal polls have shown Democratic challenger J.B. Pritzker with a double-digit lead over Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. But after 2016, no one wants to get too confident with polls. Rauner dismisses them.\n\n3. How will the governor\u2019s race affect the outcome of GOP races? The Republican governor has been a definite lag on all the GOP races, according to D and R sources. \u201cIf he loses by 10 or more, it\u2019s going to be a tough day for Republicans,\u201d predicted one GOP operative. Rauner\u2019s failure to invest big in candidates or in the party has resulted in \u201cunder-funded Republican campaigns versus over-funded Dem campaigns.\u201d The irony is that four years ago he did exactly what Pritzker\u2019s done this time around. Watch for the outcomes of three open state house seats now held by Republicans Steve Andersson of Geneva, Mike Fortner of West Chicago and David Harris of Mount Prospect.\n\n4. When will we know the outcome of the governor\u2019s race? If the margin is as wide as some polls suggest, it could be an early call.\n\n5. If Pritzker wins, what will he do first? Expect big, sweeping announcements in the coming days--including a plan for statewide broadband internet.\n\n6. Why is the attorney general\u2019s race so close? Lots of reasons, according to observers in in D and R camps. Republican Erika Harold is within striking distance of Democratic state Sen. Kwame Raoul, who has an edge in polls. Harold has called attention to the fact that she could be the only Republican in statewide public office, allowing for a check on the Democrat leadership. That argument hits home with voters. The only person more unpopular than Donald Trump in Illinois these days, seems to be House Speaker Mike Madigan. Harold also is poised and polished. Raoul, meanwhile, \u201cis smart and a good legislator but not a natural campaigner or debater,\u201d as one Democrat put it. Big question if Harold loses: Should she have gone on TV sooner?\n\n7. Where would we see early signs of a blue wave? Watch for results from races in the western suburbs, northwest suburbs and Lake County. The 6th and 14th congressional districts mentioned above could signal a blue wave that helps carry Democrats to control the U.S. House. A few statehouse races also will be affected. In District 54, for example, the outcome of the race between Republican state Rep. Tom Morrison and Democratic challenger Maggie Trevor will indicate what GOP voters have the stomach for. Morrison drew headlines for writing a letter vouching for a convicted child abuser in Arizona\u2014someone he knew from his teaching days in Arlington Heights. Morrison retracted the letter, but it\u2019s raised questions about his judgment. Will suburban Republicans overlook that? Another race to watch is state Rep. Peter Breen\u2019s against Democrat Terra Costa Howard in the 48th District. Breen\u2019s \u201cextreme positions\u201d were in the spotlight with Trump abortion and the Supreme Court hearings, according to a Dem operative. Breen became a target for Personal PAC, a pro-choice political action committee.\n\n8. Is there a Trump effect in Illinois? Absolutely. Look for it to play out in a variety of ways. The president probably helped in a few races in central and southern Illinois, including Republican incumbents Mike Bost (12th) and Rodney Davis (13th). Bost faces Democrat Brendan Kelly, the state's attorney of St. Clair County. And Davis faces Dem challenger Betsy Dirksen Londrigan. The races are among the closest in the country. Should Bost and/or Davis win, they can credit Trump for getting them over the line with the GOP base. Farther north, Hultgren\u2019s district supported Trump, so no surprise the Republican zipped downstate to hang with the president when he visited here the other day. But for Roskam, Trump is kryptonite. Trump could also impact the Cook County 17th District commissioner race between first-time Dem candidate Abdelnasser Rashid and incumbent Sean Morrison, who\u2019s also chair of the Cook County Republican Party. Some polls have had the race deadlocked. The district stretching from Des Plaines to Orland Park is considered Republican. Democrats also have targeted Tim Schneider, the Republicans state party chairman.\n\n9. What about the 3rd District congressional race between neo-Nazi Republican Arthur Jones and Democrat Rep. Dan Lipinski? Watch to see if write-in candidate Justin Hanson makes any headway. He\u2019s been on a mission to inform constituents about Jones\u2019 past.\n\n10. A judicial races to watch: The outcome of embattled Cook County Circuit Judge Matthew Coghlan will say something about voters\u2014whether they read all the literature that said Coghlan shouldn\u2019t be retained.\n\n11. Do long lines at polls mean more voters? It\u2019s too early to tell. The state has a record number of registered voters for this election with 8.05 million. That's higher than the 2016 presidential election (8.03 million) and well above the 2014 midterm (7.48 million). Illinois also has \u201cvastly exceeded\u201d the number of early votes and mail votes cast before Election Day in the 2014 midterm (1.15 million today; 791,000 in 2014), says Matt Dietrich, spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections. And we\u2019re close to the 2016 pace for total early/mail count, which was 1.89 million. So what does that all mean? More people voting could transfer to a boost for Democrats, though that\u2019s not a given. After a year of #MeToo, these midterms are expected to see more women and more young people at the polls, which also usually favors Democrats.\n\nWelcome to POLITICO\u2019s Illinois Playbook.

The dozens of black and Latino ministers in the room almost choked on their Maggiano\u2019s chicken at the the very thought.\n\nWilson: \u201cWhen I go over to Hammond, Indiana, I see a lot of you all in them casinos over there,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need to legalize marijuana. That could bring in billions of dollars a year (too). I know we got ministers in here. But some of the time, I know probably you all at one time smoked it yourself, alright?\u201d There was a burst of collective laughter. Talk about finesse.\n\nThe candidate was less subtle on other issues. If mayor, Wilson would bag red-light cameras and the 7-cent bag tax. And he\u2019d let seniors ride the CTA for free. Wilson vowed he\u2019d be the next mayor, but first he faces a crowd of candidates--including at least half a dozen African Americans who could pull away votes. That seems to irritate Wilson to no end. \u201cThey ain\u2019t got no money,\u201d said the self-made millionaire. \u201cThey need to get out of the way.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cYes, it\u2019s a little unseemly\u201d that Democratic Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza is likely to begin her campaign for mayor of Chicago on Wednesday morning before she\u2019s had a chance to brush the confetti out of her hair from her expected re-election victory party Tuesday night, writes the Tribune\u2019s Eric Zorn.

The hack was astonished. No chance, he said. The reformers, he explained, didn\u2019t have anybody watching the polls. They didn\u2019t know if their voters were turning out.\n\nPolitical professionals know that righteousness doesn\u2019t win elections. Neither does a great series of position papers. And even charisma isn\u2019t enough if you don\u2019t get out the vote. More than a century ago, an ambitious Democratic district leader from Manhattan\u2019s old Gashouse District \u2014 where Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village are now \u2014 had his people watching polls and reporting back who had voted, and who had not, by 3 p.m. The leader dispatched handwritten notes to those missing in action, reminding them of their civic duty. A few years later, the district leader, Charles Francis Murphy, became the boss of Tammany Hall. And everybody knew why: He could get out the vote.\n\nOn days like today, it\u2019s not about what you\u2019ve promised and not even about what you\u2019ve delivered. It\u2019s not about who you\u2019ve scared or who you\u2019ve inspired. It\u2019s all about getting your people to exercise their franchise. The best among the political class try to make that process easy. The worst scheme to make it hard.\n\nThe late Mario Biaggi exhibited the best and the worst of politics. The grandfather of Alessandra Biaggi, who is expected to clinch a Senate seat tonight as part of this year\u2019s progressive wave in New York, ended his long congressional career in 1988 in disgrace. But long before he was found guilty of corruption charges, Biaggi carried on a years-long personal crusade to move Election Day to Sunday, rather than the traditional Tuesday. He was convinced that Sunday voting would bring more people to the polls, and that was a good thing. Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter all sort-of endorsed Biaggi\u2019s idea after they left office, but needless to say, it hasn\u2019t quite happened.\n\nHere\u2019s one more small Election Day mediation: There\u2019s no question that this year\u2019s midterms have inspired an extraordinary amount of energy and enthusiasm on both sides of the partisan divide. That\u2019s good for democracy. And do you know who you can thank for that?\n\nYeah, him. \u2014 Terry Golway\n\n13 THINGS TO WATCH ON ELECTION DAY: This year\u2019s gubernatorial race was decided on primary night, when Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s landslide victory over Cynthia Nixon confirmed that he would indeed easily win a third term. At least that was the conventional wisdom until Sunday, when a Siena poll revealed that Republican Marc Molinaro has significantly narrowed the gap with Cuomo in recent weeks, letting the the challenger invoke the possibility of a surprise come from behind win similar to George Pataki\u2019s in 1994. It is an unlikely scenario, for reasons discussed below, but the numbers at least leave Molinaro with the faintest glimmer of a pulse heading into Election Day. The biggest intrigue surrounds legislative contests. Democrats are optimistic that they can win a majority in the state Senate for only the fifth time since World War II and have enough members for a functioning majority for the first time since the 1930s. There might be signs that it\u2019s a wave year favoring the left, but Democrats have notoriously found ways to miss out on easy paths to the majority in the past, so nothing will be certain until late Tuesday night. And in Congress, Democratic hopes for a majority could hinge in large part on picking up at least two of the nine House seats currently held by Republicans in the state\u2019s suburban and upstate House districts.

The company is nearing a deal to move to the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, according to two of the people briefed on the discussions. Amazon is also close to a deal to move to the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., a Washington suburb, one of the people said. Amazon already has more employees in those two areas than anywhere else outside of Seattle, its home base, and the Bay Area. Amazon executives met two weeks ago with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in the governor\u2019s Manhattan office, said another of the people briefed on the process, adding that the state had offered potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies.

If the name Long Island City once seemed aspirational, in recent years it has been more descriptive: Apartment towers now dot the skyline, crowding around the elevated No. 7 subway train. There have been 41 new apartment buildings built there since 2010, according to an analysis by the city.

YES! MAYBE? \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Sally Goldenberg: Candidates vying for citywide office in 2021 will have to decide whether to opt into a reformed campaign finance system or stick with the old rules, should the mayor\u2019s ballot initiative pass on Tuesday. The ballot question, one of three born out of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s $3 million Charter Revision Commission, would cut maximum donations in New York City races from $5,100 to $2,000, while increasing the taxpayer-backed match on contributions. Proponents say it would reduce the influence of well-heeled donors by stretching smaller donations further: the city would match the first $250 of every qualifying contribution by 8-to-1. Currently, $175 of each donation gets a 6-to-1 match. As a result, they say challengers to incumbents will have a better shot at victory. \u201cOne of the things that has really worried people and alienated people about the political process is that there\u2019s too much money in it,\u201d de Blasio \u2014 who has benefited throughout his political career from the same kinds of donations he\u2019s now denouncing \u2014 told parishioners at Christian Cultural Center on Sunday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want elections to be about money; we want them to be about people,\u201d he added.

Common Cause New York is demanding the mayor's office and the city's Board of Elections get on the same page in order to serve the needs of New Yorkers. \"This is a very solvable situation if you have two entities that want to serve the voters and not politically posture,\" said Susan Lerner, the group's executive director. A voter is allowed to bring one of the translators inside the polling place to help them cast their ballot, but according to the city, the Board of Elections is requiring the translators to adhere to electioneering laws and thus demanding that they stay away from the building's entrance.

Bob Menendez said Monday his Republican rival, Bob Hugin, would be \u201cjust another rubber stamp\u201d for President Donald Trump and portrayed his own reelection as being as much as referendum on the president as on his own record. Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive, continued to label Menendez a \u201ccorrupt\u201d politician and called him \u201cthe worst senator New Jersey\u2019s ever had,\u201d declaring the Democrat is \u201cnot the role model for our children and our grandchildren.\u201d Those were the closing arguments in a vicious, months-long, $50 million battle for a U.S. Senate seat few thought would be in jeopardy of falling into Republican hands, despite a failed effort to prosecute Menendez on federal corruption charges.

Someone from the White House had a question: How is Tom MacArthur going to do tomorrow? \u2018I said, \u2018Well, if Ocean County does its job, and we follow through, we will win,\u2019\u2019 Gilmore said, recounting the story at one of the incumbent congressman's last campaign stops in Toms River.

In fact, health care has been a top voter priority for more than a decade, and most dramatically in 2010, with a Tea Party-fueled backlash over the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health care law. Right-wing critics called the Affordable Care Act socialized medicine that threatened the very fabric of democracy. They warned that \u2018Obamacare\u2019 would destroy the economy. The campaign of fury worked.

So as Election Day nears, GOP candidates in New Jersey battlegrounds \u2014 races that could help determine which party controls Congress in the next two years \u2014 are spending the campaign's closing days distancing themselves from Trump, offering nuanced support or trying to change the subject and touting bipartisanship.\u201d Read the report\n\nGROUND GAME \u2014 \u201cLate game convergences: Driven by anti-Trump outrage (and their own organizational interests) Democrats pour it on for the finale,\u201d by InsiderNJ\u2019s Max Pizarro: \u201cIn a side-by-side comparison of GOTV events in the closing hours of this historic campaign cycle, Democrats proved more robustly overlapped by party organizations and new voters determined to voice their disapproval of President Donald J. Trump than Republicans looking to capitalize on a wounded U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-NJ) or navigate political straits severely complicated by the President.

And welcome to a special Election Day edition of Massachusetts Playbook. Where are you watching the results come in tonight?\n\nHERE\u2019S WHAT I\u2019M WATCHING...\n\n\u2014 Who turns out? Secretary of State Bill Galvin expects 2.4 million Massachusetts voters will cast ballots in this year's midterm, including the 584,000 early voters. We have around 4.5 million registered voters in Massachusetts, so the expected turnout is about half of that. Stay tuned on whether turnout ends up being higher \u2014 especially among newly registered voters \u2014 like we're seeing in other states.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBaker's margin \u2014 He's America's most popular governor, he's leading in the polls and he's polling better with Democrats than his Democratic opponent. So what's Baker's winning margin going to be? \"Massachusetts voters are perfectly content with moderate Republican governors and they have been forever,\" political analyst Peter Ubertaccio told me yesterday. But can Baker beat former Gov. Bill Weld's 71 percent win in 1994? The \"Trump effect\" of Democrats turning out because they're fed up with Washington could keep Baker below Weld's storied margin, Ubertaccio says.\n\nThe Warren report \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren already said she's taking a look at running for president, and the way she went after Geoff Diehl on all things Trump made clear this election is a warm-up for 2020. I'll be looking to see what percentage of the vote she pulls in tonight, and further down the line, whether Massachusetts voters warm to her possible presidential ambitions.\n\nThe Trumpers \u2014 Despite Baker\u2019s electoral success as a moderate, we\u2019ve got a couple of candidates on the ballot today who embrace President Trump more willingly. Perhaps the most talked about is Geoff Diehl, the Republican taking on Sen. Elizabeth Warren. He was part of the president\u2019s Massachusetts campaign, and Warren has labeled him a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for Trump\u2019s agenda. The other candidate embracing the president\u2019s policies is hard-line Republican attorney from Bourne, Jay McMahon. He\u2019s running for attorney general and rips on Attorney General Maura Healey\u2019s assault weapons ban. I\u2019m interested in the kind of numbers Diehl and McMahon get. Remember when far-right Republican for governor Scott Lively pulled in 36 percent of the vote in the Republican primary? Now we\u2019ll get a look at something close to a baseline, pro-Trump GOP vote in Massachusetts.\n\nThe new additions to the delegation \u2014 A congressional seat is open in the 3rd District, where Democrat Lori Trahan, Republican Rick Green and Independent Michael Mullen are on the ballot. Another interesting congressional race worth keeping an eye on is in the state's 9th District, where Rep. Bill Keating faces Republican challenger Peter Tedeschi. The two districts encompass some of the state's more conservative pockets, and if there are any surprises tonight, they could happen here, MassInc pollster Steve Koczela told me. Democrat Ayanna Pressley is running unopposed in the 7th District after unseating Rep. Mike Capuano in the primary.\n\nThe ballot questions \u2014 Does Question 1, the nurse patient staffing level question, prevail despite weakening public support shown in polling over the last several weeks? How many people vote \"yes\" on Question 3, and what's the party breakdown?\n\nHow do Moulton's Serve America candidates do? \u2014 Rep. Seth Moulton has been raising money and traveling for Democratic candidates endorsed by his Serve America PAC this cycle. How many of Moulton's more than 70 picks win tonight?\n\nClark's Blue Wave \u2014 Rep. Katherine Clark has spent the last two years helping Democrats across the country flip their districts from red to blue. I'm looking to see how many of these candidates are successful.

At issue is an August 2017 email exchange with David Taylor, the city planner for Whitefish, Mont. Zinke authorized him to access the property and explained that he was engaged in negotiations with a real estate developer over building a parking lot on his foundation\u2019s land.\n\n\u201cBut under an ethics pledge he signed Jan. 10, 2017, Zinke vowed to step down from his position as president of the Great Northern Veterans Peace Park Foundation after winning confirmation and refrain from participating in any matters concerning the group for one year. Zinke won confirmation on March 1, 2017, but state records and the foundation\u2019s 2018 annual report listed him as continuing to serve as a foundation officer months after that. Zinke later said the foundation\u2019s report was in error.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- \u201cTrump hedges Zinke support amid probes,\u201d by Zack Colman, Eliana Johnson and Ben Lefebvre: \u201cPresident Donald Trump offered less-than-effusive praise Monday for embattled Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, while saying he might not \u2018be happy\u2019 with the outcomes of the investigations into Zinke\u2019s behavior. \u2018I\u2019m going to look at any reports, I\u2019ll take a look,\u2019 Trump told reporters when asked if he was troubled by recent news reports about Zinke, which have included a potential Justice Department criminal investigation and growing scrutiny of a land deal involving the chairman of Halliburton. \u2018Certainly, I would not be happy with that at all. But I will take a look. But he has done a very good job as secretary.\u2019 ...\n\n\u201cAllies inside and outside the administration have begun to distance themselves from Zinke. But even as those problems mushroomed, a former White House official told POLITICO on Monday, Zinke continued to pitch himself for more prominent jobs in Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 including as a possible replacement for Pruitt at EPA.\u201d POLITICO\n\nHQ2 TO VIRGINIA AND QUEENS? \u2026 \u201cAmazon Plans to Split HQ2 Evenly Between Two Cities,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Laura Stevens and Shayndi Raice: \u201cAmazon.com Inc. plans to split its second headquarters evenly between two locations rather than picking one city, according to a person familiar with the matter, a surprise decision that will spread the impact of a massive new office across a pair of communities. The driving force behind the decision to build two equal offices for \u2018HQ2\u2019\u2014in addition to the company\u2019s headquarters in Seattle\u2014is to allow it to recruit more of the best tech talent, according to the person familiar with the company\u2019s plans.\u201d WSJ\n\nHEADED SOUTH \u2026 \u201cLePage\u2019s future plans: Move to Florida, take teaching job,\u201d by the Portland Press Herald\u2019s Kevin Miller in Augusta, Maine: \u201cGov.

The ad ran about a dozen times on Fox News and Fox Business, combined, before being pulled. Facebook also came under scrutiny for letting the Trump campaign run the ad on its platform. On Monday afternoon the company said \u2018this ad violates Facebook\u2019s advertising policy against sensational content so we are rejecting it.

Metro Atlanta and the Delaware Valley. Orange County, Calif., and Maricopa County, Ariz.\n\nThese areas are among a relatively small set of places that will play an outsized role in picking the winners and losers of the midterm elections. A Democratic sweep of upstate New York could deliver nearly a quarter of the seats needed to overcome the GOP\u2019s 23-seat majority in the House. Likewise, a strong GOP turnout in traditionally conservative Orange County could bolster Republican hopes of holding down the damage in the House \u2014 and maybe even help salvage the majority.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMost of these places have been blanketed by TV ads for months because they\u2019re home to a concentration of battleground House races or they\u2019re essential to closely contested Senate or governor\u2019s races. How Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County goes, for example, could affect the balance of power in the Senate because of its critical role in the contest between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally.\n\nWhether they are rural in character or metropolitan, Republican or Democratic in their voting habits, the common denominator in these places is that they will be influential in shaping the next Congress and determining which parties hold statehouse power.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nUpstate New York\n\nThere are nine Republicans in New York\u2019s 27-member House delegation and every single one of them is within reach for Democrats this year.\n\nThe bulk of these endangered seats are concentrated in upstate New York, far from New York City. Freshmen Reps. John Faso and Claudia Tenney are fighting for their political lives. In Western New York, Reps. John Katko and Chris Collins are perhaps slightly better situated, but Collins is campaigning under the shadow of indictments on insider trading charges. Reps. Elise Stefanik and Tom Reed are in races that are more competitive than they once figured to be.\n\nDownstate Illinois\n\nThere are different definitions of what exactly constitutes downstate Illinois, but it generally means everything south of the Chicago metro area. It\u2019s a far more conservative place than Chicagoland and this year there are two GOP House members there, Reps. Mike Bost and Rodney Davis, who are in tough reelection campaigns. This is the part of a very blue state where President Donald Trump remains somewhat popular, so he\u2019s come to the region at least twice in recent months to bolster their chances.\n\nComplicating their predicament, however, is Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. He's on a trajectory to lose to Democrat J.B. Pritzker by a wide margin, and a poor GOP performance in southern Illinois at the top of the ticket could play a role in dragging down Bost and Davis, not to mention the Republican slate of state legislative candidates.\n\nThat would only compound Republican problems in Illinois: In the Chicago suburbs and exurbs, there are two more Republican House incumbents who are in even more serious danger \u2014 Reps. Randy Hultgren and Peter Roskam, who are contending with blowback from Trump\u2019s polarizing presidency.\n\nDelaware Valley\n\nThe Delaware Valley region is essentially southeastern Pennsylvania and parts of South Jersey \u2014 in other words, the Philadelphia metropolitan area. And depending on how broadly you define the region, there are at least a half-dozen House seats in play.\n\nOn the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River, a map drawn by the state Supreme Court earlier this year has scrambled the House landscape, nowhere more than in the populous southeastern corner of the state. GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is locked in a toss-up battle in Bucks County. The two other nearby Philly suburban districts (the 5th and 6th Districts), neither of which have an incumbent running, are expected to be Democratic pick-ups. Farther north toward Allentown, in the district formerly held by GOP Rep. Charlie Dent, Democrats have the edge.\n\nAs far as Pennsylvania statewide elections go, a recent Franklin & Marshall poll shows Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey swamping their Republican opponents in the Southeast.\n\nOn the Jersey side, the Shore-based seat held by retiring GOP Rep. Frank LoBiondo is widely acknowledged to be long gone \u2014 count it as a Democratic pick-up. The neighboring 3rd District held by GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur, on the other hand, is highly competitive: It snapped from voting for Barack Obama by 5 points to Donald Trump by 6 in 2016.\n\nOrange County, Calif.\n\nFrom Los Angeles to San Diego, Southern California is loaded with barn-burner House races this year. But it\u2019s Orange County, the longtime conservative bastion that used to be called \u201cAmerica\u2019s most Republican county,\u201d that\u2019s drawn all the attention.\n\nHillary Clinton carried Orange County in 2016, the first time in 80 years the county voted Democratic for president. And on the heels of that election there are four closely contested races there that are critical to Democratic chances of retaking the House. Republicans outnumber Democrats in terms of voter registration in each of those suburban-oriented districts, but they\u2019re all razor-close.\n\nGOP Reps. Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher are locked in toss-up contests; the seat left vacant by GOP Rep. Ed Royce\u2019s retirement is also too close to call. The seat held by retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, which covers both Orange and San Diego counties, might be the most endangered of them all.\n\nMetro Atlanta\n\nFor decades, suburban Gwinnett and Cobb counties could usually be counted on to deliver comfortable Republican margins. But both left the fold in 2016 to vote Democratic in a presidential race for the first time since 1976.\n\nWith tight races for governor and in two competitive Republican-held House races in the Atlanta suburbs, those two counties \u2014 the two most populous in the state after Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County \u2014 will have the spotlight on them Tuesday. In the governor\u2019s contest, Democrat Stacey Abrams will need to do well with suburban college-educated women against Republican Brian Kemp.\n\nIn the 7th District, which is rooted in increasingly diverse Gwinnett, GOP Rep. Rob Woodall is expected to face his toughest test yet \u2014 since first capturing the seat in 2010, he\u2019s never won less than 60 percent of the vote. In the 6th District \u2014 where a deep vein of suburban anti-Trump sentiment was revealed in its 2017 special election \u2014 GOP Rep. Karen Handel faces stiff competition in her bid to win a full term.\n\nLas Vegas\n\nThe Las Vegas media market saw $103 million in political ad spending in this election cycle \u2014 second only to Orlando, Fla. The reason is that the bulk of the state vote is cast there, and Nevada is filled with barn-burner elections this year.\n\nThere\u2019s the toss-up Senate race between GOP Sen. Dean Heller and Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, and another toss-up contest for governor. There are also two Clark County-based, open House seats that are must wins for Democrats. Democrats have the edge in both of them, according to POLITICO\u2019s race ratings, but neither is a slam dunk.\n\nMaricopa County, Ariz.\n\nMaricopa County, which includes the Phoenix metropolitan area, is home to roughly two-thirds of Arizona voters. At the presidential level, it\u2019s voted Republican in every election since 1952, but it\u2019s not especially enamored of Donald Trump. In 2016, when the county cast roughly 60 percent of the state presidential vote, the president won by a narrow plurality.\n\nThis year, polls show Republican Senate nominee Martha McSally is lagging behind in Maricopa. That\u2019s a big problem in her race against Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, who represents a Maricopa County-based congressional seat. But whether the county delivers its typical GOP margins is a question that will affect more than just the Senate race. There are also a governor\u2019s race, where GOP Gov. Doug Ducey is the favorite, and two competitive House races anchored in Maricopa County \u2014 Republican Rep. David Schweikert\u2019s 6th District and Rep. Debbie Lesko\u2019s 8th District.\n\nNorth Jersey\n\nDemocratic strongholds in Hudson, Bergen, Essex and Passaic counties will be critical to embattled Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez\u2019s chances of winning reelection against Republican Bob Hugin. High turnout in Hudson County, where the senator once headed the local party organization, is especially important.\n\nAnd in a year when the state\u2019s Republican incumbents are under siege across the state, there are several House contests in North Jersey where strong Democratic turnout could also make the difference. In the open 11th, an affluent Morris County-based seat held for 24 years by Republican Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen before he announced his retirement, Democratic nominee Mikie Sherrill has the edge despite the district\u2019s GOP lean.\n\nIn the 7th, GOP Rep. Leonard Lance is struggling to hang on in a Republican-leaning suburban seat that Clinton carried in 2016. There\u2019s also a Democratic-held seat here \u2014 Rep. Josh Gotteheimer\u2019s 5th District \u2014 that bears watching because of its Republican lineage, but the freshman Democrat looks well-positioned to win a second term.\n\nMiami-Dade County, Fla.\n\nWith competitive House races in the Miami-based 25th, 26th and 27th congressional districts and two nationally watched statewide races \u2014 Senate and gubernatorial contests that are considered toss-ups \u2014 few areas are more important than Miami.\n\nMiami-Dade County is the most populous in the state; the Miami-Ft. Lauderdale media market has seen some $80 million in spending on political ads. The 26th District, where GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo is trying to hold on in a district Clinton carried by 16 points in 2016, has emerged as one of the nation\u2019s priciest: $20 million in ad spending alone.\n\n\n\nOakland County, Mich.\n\nAffluent, white-collar Oakland County is the most populous in the state after Detroit\u2019s Wayne County. A strong Republican performance there is essential to GOP hopes in statewide races.\n\nBut with GOP chances flagging in both the Senate and governor\u2019s races this year, the real question there is whether the party can hang onto the 8th and 11th congressional districts. In the 8th District, GOP Rep. Mike Bishop is thought to be the most vulnerable incumbent Republican in Michigan's delegation. Oakland will play a role in determining his fate, having cast close to 40 percent of the district\u2019s vote in 2016. Reached by both the Lansing and Detroit media markets, it\u2019s been one of the most expensive House races in the nation in terms of ad spending, $21 million in total.\n\nIn the entirely Oakland-based 11th \u2014 a Republican-leaning suburban seat left vacant this year by the retirement of GOP Rep. Dave Trott \u2014 Democrat Haley Stevens is thought to have a slight advantage over Republican Lena Epstein.\n\nGreater Houston\n\nThe Houston metropolitan area features an array of competitive House elections this year \u2014 none as closely watched as the suburban 7th District. There, Republican John Culberson is in a toss-up race against Democrat Lizzie Fletcher, who has capitalized on suburban disenchantment with Trump. The district whiplashed from a 21-point Mitt Romney victory in 2012 to a 1-point Clinton win four years later. Houston TV has been bombarded with $19.4 million in ads from the race.\n\nThe Harris County-based 2nd District, typically solidly Republican, is competitive for the first time in years with GOP Rep. Ted Poe\u2019s retirement. The 22nd District, another solidly Republican seat entirely within the Houston media market, is closer than anyone expected, with GOP Rep. Pete Olson slightly favored to win.\n\n", "We\u2019ll have a team of 20 reporters and editors in six states providing live analysis and commentary all night. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images Elections Follow POLITICO\u2019s wall-to-wall election coverage Welcome to Election Day.

It had been 28 years since a Republican had won Wisconsin, Michigan or Pennsylvania\u2014states belonging to a much-hyped \u201cblue wall\u201d that narrowed the GOP\u2019s path to 270 electoral votes. As it became clear, however, that Trump would carry all three states, and secure blowouts in the traditional battlegrounds of Ohio and Iowa, a new reality took hold. Whereas Republicans once believed they could win the presidency only by using the George W. Bush playbook\u2014appealing to affluent, suburban populations in diverse states such as Virginia, Colorado and Nevada\u2014Trump proved the truer route to the White House went through working-class whites in the industrial Midwest.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe narrative of a sweeping realignment was irresistible. Analysts branded the Rust Belt as \u201cTrump Country.\u201d Streaming into greasy spoons, shot-and-a-beer bars and Walmarts across the Midwest, reporters pumped out anecdotal insights into the forgotten masses in middle America. And Republican officials, almost instantaneously, shifted their outlook. It didn\u2019t matter that Trump had won Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by fewer than 78,000 votes combined\u2014not enough people to fill a popular Big Ten football stadium\u2014or that his path through those states was necessitated by his defeat in once-purple areas of the country. Trump had redrawn the Electoral College map, they insisted, and the implications were far-reaching: Rust Belt Democrats could soon become an endangered species.\n\nNow, on the eve of the 2018 midterm elections, Republicans are bracing for a massacre in the Midwest.\n\n\u201cWhen we woke up after the 2016 election, there was a real possibility that we were seeing a realignment among white working-class voters in the Midwest\u2014and that they could go the way that white working-class voters have gone in the South over the past generation,\u201d said Matt Grossman, a political scientist at Michigan State University. \u201cBut two years later, there\u2019s no sign that those gains are holding or being extended. Instead, there are a lot of campaigns in that region where Republicans are struggling to be competitive.\u201d\n\nTrump bears much of the responsibility. His approval rating has plunged, by double digits, in most Midwestern states. His presidency has energized the Democratic base in ways Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy never could. His party\u2019s rewrite of the tax code was disproportionately beneficial to wealthy people and corporations; to the extent the law is popular with voters, he barely tries to promote it. And his trade warring has been burdensome to farmers and blue-collar workers in manufacturing-heavy swatches of middle America, with numerous Republicans from affected states, including Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Steve Stivers of Ohio, privately pleading with Trump and his aides to find a resolution.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

For one thing, Republicans failed to recruit\u2014or cultivate\u2014top-tier candidates in many high-profile races. Democratic challengers outraised GOP incumbents across the region and the country. Complacency has beset portions of the conservative base, with a combination of tax cuts, judicial nominees and regulatory reforms leaving some Republicans fat and happy. Above all, not everyone voting against the Republican Party on Tuesday is voting against Trump; the president persuaded lots of Democratic voters in 2016 without durably changing their party affiliations.\n\nStill, Trump says his name is on the ballot, and the electorate appears to be behaving accordingly. In visits this fall to Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and Minnesota, and in conversations with Republican voters and officials, I found signs of alarm relating to 2018\u2014and a sense of foreboding related to the repercussions beyond.\n\nIn Michigan, which Trump carried by 10,704 votes, Democrats are expected to take over numerous state legislative seats, win back the governorship and hold onto Debbie Stabenow\u2019s Senate seat despite a spirited challenge from blue-chip Republican nominee John James. Meanwhile, Democrats are threatening to win a pair of congressional districts, the 8th and 11th, that are anchored in traditionally Republican suburbs. Democrats are also poised to win the race for attorney general\u2014and perhaps most significant of all, the secretary of state\u2019s office, giving the party considerable power to liberalize voting laws before the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cDemocrats could make it structurally harder for Trump,\u201d said Rob Steele, the Republican National Committeeman from Michigan. \u201cIf the secretary of state is a Democrat, then you\u2019ll see a significant change in how people are looking at voting laws and ballot integrity. My message is, if you want to help Trump, you have to elect these other Republicans.\u201d Steele knows that demographics are working against the GOP; even in predominantly white Michigan, the state is growing increasingly urban and college-educated, which explains the competitiveness of the 8th and 11th districts. \u201cThe more money in those areas,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more Democratic they get.\u201d\n\nIn Wisconsin, which Trump carried by 22,748 votes, Democrats have already begun flipping state legislative seats\u2014prompting warnings of a \u201cBlue Wave\u201d from Governor Scott Walker, which irritated Trump and the White House political operation. Walker himself is in trouble: After two terms in office (and three elections, including the failed recall election in 2012), many Republicans believe the governor will lose to Democrat Tony Evers. In the other prominent statewide race, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin\u2014who, like Stabenow in Michigan, is steady but unspectacular\u2014is cruising to a comfortable victory over Republican challenger Leah Vukmir. Wisconsin Republicans also worry they could lose the attorney general\u2019s office, though one thing the party isn\u2019t sweating is congressional seats: The only competitive race is in the 1st District to replace Ryan, and Democrats likely made a fatal mistake in nominating Randy Bryce, a union member with personality but tons of political baggage, instead of Cathy Myers, who, Republicans feared, would have flipped the seat.\n\n\u201cThis political climate is one that I\u2019ve never seen in my lifetime,\u201d says Chris Goebel, chairman of the GOP in Walworth County, one of Wisconsin\u2019s conservative strongholds. \u201cIn the past, you voted with your pocketbooks. But people get thrown out of office when voters are this angry.\u201d At a party unity event in late September, the longtime stars of the state GOP\u2014Walker, Ryan and Reince Priebus\u2014celebrated past victories in tones befitting a memorial. Walker told me this political environment was harsher than in cycles past and argued that Trump owed his success in the Midwest to strong state parties. Without them, he implied, it\u2019s tough to imagine the president running the table in the Rust Belt again. \u201cI would argue the reason [Trump] was able to do that was because Republicans had made the case in those states and showed we could actually get things done,\u201d Walker said.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, which Trump carried by 44,292 votes, Republicans are staring into the abyss. Due in large measure to a court-executed redistricting of the state\u2019s gerrymandered congressional districts, Democrats could flip a half-dozen seats in the state; at worst, they should win four. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s top Democratic incumbents, Gov. Tom Wolf and Sen. Bob Casey, are both coasting to reelection. And, as in Michigan and Pennsylvania, Democrats are expected to win back a healthy number of Republican-held state legislative seats.\n\nOne reason is that wayward Democrats are simply coming home. \u201cPennsylvania does have many sons and daughters of what we could call Reagan Democrats, particularly in the central and western part of the state. They went for Donald Trump in big numbers\u2014they put him over the top,\u201d said John Brabender, the pre-eminent GOP strategist in the state. \u201cBut there was this wild assumption that because they voted for Trump in 2016, that they would vote for Republicans in 2018. But these people are still Democrats. They\u2019re still going to vote for Democrats. And what we forget is that it wasn\u2019t a vote on Donald Trump up-or-down in 2016; it was Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton. If Hillary Clinton was on the ballot against some of these Republicans, we\u2019d be doing a lot better.\u201d\n\nEven in those Midwestern states won handily by Trump, there are red flags galore.\n\nIn Ohio, which Trump won by 447,000 votes\u2014a relatively whopping 8 percentage points\u2014Republicans are expected to lose seats in the Legislature for the first time in a decade. They are in danger of losing the deep-red 12th Congressional District , which they just spent millions to defend in a summertime special election. Republicans are also likely to lose the majority of statewide elections. In the U.S. Senate race, incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown will likely win by double digits over the challenger, Republican congressman Jim Renacci. And in the governor\u2019s race, despite incumbent Republican John Kasich leaving office with approval ratings in the 50s, the race is a toss-up between Democrat Richard Cordray and Republican Mike DeWine.\n\nIn Iowa, which Trump won by 147,000 votes\u2014or 9.5 percentage points\u2014Democrats are poised for gains across the state. Republicans control three of Iowa\u2019s four congressional seats, and all of them are being contested. Rod Blum, the incumbent in the 1st District, is likely a goner, and David Young in the 3rd District is hanging on for dear life. Even Steve King, the immigration hard-liner who represents the ultraconservative 4th District, faces a legitimate challenge from Democrat J.D. Scholten. Democrats are likely to pick up numerous legislative seats and could even retake control of the state House. And statewide, among other races Republicans are worried about, Governor Kim Reynolds is in deep trouble against Democratic challenger Fred Hubbell.\n\nAnd in Minnesota, which Trump lost by 45,000 votes, the only good news for Republicans is a likely pickup in the vacated 8th Congressional District. Otherwise, the state looks bleak: Democrats appear certain to flip two Republican-held congressional seats, in the 2nd and 3rd districts, while holding onto the governorship and both U.S. Senate seats. Even the attorney general\u2019s race\u2014in which Democrat Keith Ellison, the former congressman, has been dogged by allegations of sexual assault\u2014is thought to be slipping away from Republicans.\n\nStrategists in both parties have stressed the volatility of this election cycle, and Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 demonstrated that polling can be unreliable. Still, in the final weeks before the midterm elections, Republicans in the Rust Belt were in agreement that Nov. 6 would be a rough night at best\u2014and a disaster at worst.\n\nThe three states of greatest concern for the GOP continue to be Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. This isn\u2019t simply because Democrats are poised to pitch a shutout against Republicans in the highest-profile races there, but because without their combined 46 electoral votes, Trump would have lost the presidency. His 306 electoral votes (304 in the final tally, because of the defections of two electors) looks comfortable on paper\u2014until you consider the threadbare margins in those three Midwestern states.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump was close to winning elsewhere: He lost New Hampshire by less than 1 point, Minnesota by less than 2 points and Nevada by less than 3 points. But those states offer relatively few electoral votes; remember that Trump carried Florida and its 29 electoral votes by barely more than 1 point, and won the rapidly diversifying states of Arizona and North Carolina by less than 4 points each.\n\nAll of which ensures that Trump\u2019s path to reelection will once again run through the Midwest; that if he cedes any other parts of his winning 2016 map, most essentially Florida, the president will likely have to run the table in Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cI think that he pulled an inside straight in 2016, and he hasn\u2019t done that much to change his cards, so he may have to pull another inside straight,\u201d David Axelrod, chief strategist to the Obama campaigns, said in a recent interview for POLITICO\u2019s Off Message podcast. \u201cIf the results are what they look to be, I think it\u2019s an important harbinger for him that Republicans just didn\u2019t do well in those states that delivered the presidency to him.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s midterm elections mark the beginning of the 2020 campaign. And for all the focus on suburbanites fleeing the GOP, a blue wave in the Midwest would be indicative of Trump\u2019s base turning against his Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about these swing House districts that are disproportionately suburban, but the polls are showing similar movement among the white working class,\u201d said Grossman, the MSU political scientist. \u201cWhen you have states like Ohio and Iowa that swung very strongly toward Trump, and this year they are seeing Democratic voters returning to the fold, those Democratic gains would be disproportionately among the white working class.\u201d\n\nTim Alberta is chief political correspondent at Politico Magazine.\n\nThis article tagged under: Donald Trump\n\n2018 Elections", "One constant of Donald Trump\u2019s ascent to the presidency and his two years in power is how behavior that would be not just risky but downright stupid for any normal politician ends up working smartly for him.\n\nThis is the essence of the Trump Mystique\u2014a three-year record in which he regularly demonstrated that many of the normal precedents, patterns and truisms of American politics simply do not apply to him. This mystique\u2014Is it real or illusion? Is his patented sorcery still working?\u2014is among the big questions being tested in Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump\u2019s own decisions over the past month have put the issue\u2014whether Trump has defied political gravity or merely delayed its impact\u2014in even sharper relief than it would have been anyway.\n\nIt would be smart, viewed through a conventional prism, for a president who has never commanded majority support to try to float above the midterms and allow politicians of his own party to keep their elections locally focused. It seems stupid to unite and energize the opposition in their loathing by insisting that congressional elections are a national referendum on himself.\n\nIt would be smart, if playing by normal rules, for a leader presiding over the best employment numbers in decades to make an economic argument his main push against the headwind that the incumbent president\u2019s party historically faces in midterm elections. It seems stupid to reduce this to secondary status in favor of picking scabs over immigration and societal violence in the days before voting.\n\nIn the disoriented state of contemporary politics, however, it seems stupid for anyone to pretend to be smart in predicting the results of Trump\u2019s decision to turn the volume up to 11 on Trumpism.\n\nAs Trump himself cast the implications for Tuesday in a weekend stop in Georgia: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as important as \u201916, but it\u2019s right up there.\u201d\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

One is that at nearly every important turn when traditional political logic would have pointed toward softening the tone and broadening support\u2014from his 2016 acceptance speech to the 2017 inaugural address and countless other occasions since\u2014Trump took the opposite path and along the way tightened his connection to his most devoted supporters.\n\nA vivid recent example was over the sexual assault allegations against his Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh. For a few days Trump deferred to prevailing wisdom that he needed to treat accuser Christine Blasey Ford respectfully and project an open mind on the merits. Before long he returned to his customary instincts and attacked Ford, Democrats and the media, while cheering on Kavanaugh\u2019s own attacks on Democrats.\n\nFor every Republican operative who thinks Trump\u2019s midterm strategy is nuts\u2014one senior GOP strategist running competitive statewide races said the president\u2019s image took a 15-point hit in internal campaign polling over the past 10 days\u2014there is a Democratic operative who worries that Trump\u2019s polarizing approach just might allow him to beat the odds as he did in 2016.\n\nBut that same approach raises the cost of GOP setbacks for Trump, who has often made clear his own view that power is partly a matter of perception, and preserving an aura of strength and success. A narrow House loss, for instance, would surely be explained as the result of normal historical patterns. In the case of a national blowout, no matter if Trump blamed others, the result would be like a baby with a paunch and comb-over: No way to deny paternity.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s a little unfair to put it all on him, because you start behind the eight-ball,\u201d said a senior GOP Senate strategist, pointing to the usual historical pattern with a president\u2019s first midterm election. \u201cWhat I think is different [in 2018] is that while the president always has the ability to define the agenda, he takes all of the oxygen out of the air. The reality is, these races are completely national. And while there\u2019s always a national bent to congressional races, there\u2019s really no escaping it this time.\u201d\n\nA senior White House official said political advisers applied a three-prong test this fall in deciding where to send Trump. One was whether they could find good rally venues. Two was data suggesting which districts were especially promising if Trump could manage to ignite GOP-leaning voters who might normally vote in presidential elections but not midterms. Third was protectiveness, trying to avoid races where Trump would risk being blamed for a race that was a likely loser anyway.\n\nThe president\u2019s vituperative attacks on Democrats and race-baiting immigration rhetoric broke new ground on divisiveness, but in one sense he was making a calculation\u2014can a president influence the midterms to advantage?\u2014familiar to three of his recent predecessors.\n\nIn 1994, Bill Clinton\u2019s advisers urged him to take it easy and mostly stay off the campaign trail in favor of the White House and overseas trips. He didn\u2019t buy it\u2014convinced he could persuade voters to back him and Democrats if he could just get in front of enough of them. Polling suggested otherwise, and political aides later concluded that an unseasoned president\u2019s own efforts helped fuel the GOP's historic congressional takeover that year.\n\nIn 2002, the backdrop of 9/11 one year earlier changed the landscape for George W. Bush. Stressing national security themes, he helped Republicans make historically unusual congressional gains.\n\nIn 2010, Barack Obama saw a conservative backlash over spending to combat recession and the financial crash, as well as the Affordable Care Act. He campaigned in some districts where he was welcome, but he knew it wasn\u2019t doing much good. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this is a difficult election,\u201d he said at a Cleveland rally. He was right: November brought a \u201cshellacking,\u201d as he called it, that lost the House and reached deep into statehouses around the country.\n\nSimilar results in the opposite direction against Republicans on Tuesday will not only put subpoena power in the hands of the president\u2019s political foes\u2014it could lead the handful of prominent Trump dissenters in the national GOP to urge others to join their cause.\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s going to lose the House,\u201d said Bill Kristol, editor at large of the Weekly Standard and a leading Trump critic. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna lose eight to 10 governorships probably. So, where is the brilliance? Where is the political magic? ... He got 46 percent of the vote in 2016. It looks like Republicans are going to get, if they\u2019re lucky, 46 percent of the vote [or lower]. \u2026 So what has Trump done for the party?\u201d\n\nNot that Trump will admit as much. Terry Sullivan, who managed Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 campaign, suggested that one key aspect of Trump\u2019s mystique is that he will argue that his mystique is undimmed no matter the result. \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it. Ask him tomorrow,\u201d Sullivan said Monday. \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it, ask his supporters. He will say that candidates that he campaigned with won and the ones who didn\u2019t want to campaign with him lost. And the ones that lost that he campaigned with did better than they would have if they hadn\u2019t campaigned with him\u2014he made the race closer, so much closer.\u201d\n\nFor all Sullivan\u2019s evident sarcasm, Michael Strain, director of economic policy at the American Enterprise Institute, effectively agreed that Trump\u2019s activities in the closing days of the campaign might help in some districts but won\u2019t be the decisive factor if the evening ends in a big GOP defeat. \u201cI think that the cake on the president is kind of baked\u2014that people have a view of the Republican Party under Donald Trump\u201d that won\u2019t swing widely based on any day\u2019s headlines, he said. \u201cThat suggests to me that if the president were talking about the economy and not talking about the caravan, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a better strategy to get Republicans to win.\u201d\n\nJohn F.

Some have stretched six, seven, eight and even nine hours long.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe only thing that\u2019s the same in each one is that the first polls close at 6 p.m. in eastern Kentucky, prompting discussion of that particular swing race. From there, Feist said, \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready for every outcome,\u201d he said.\n\nOver in The Washington Post newsroom, national editor Steven Ginsberg says he\u2019s encouraged reporters and editors covering the midterm races to \u201cembrace not knowing\u201d what will happen on election night. His rivals at The New York Times are taking a similar tack \u2014 the approach is \u201cprepare, prepare, prepare,\u201d said politics editor Patrick Healy, but with \u201ceyes wide open for a number of scenarios.\u201d\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Conservatives mocked the reactions of television anchors as his victory became apparent. This year, editors and executives from the Times, Post, CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox News all told POLITICO that they will be prepared for any outcome \u2014 and will make sure their readers and viewers are, too.\n\nMarc Burstein, ABC News senior executive producer of special events, acknowledged \u201cthere were assumptions made in 2016 by lots of news organizations,\u201d a trap he intends to avoid this time around. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be nimble. We\u2019re going to follow the results,\u201d Burstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to assume anything.\u201d\n\nBurstein, now producing his 11th election night, said this is the biggest midterm campaign ABC has ever covered, rivaling a presidential contest. He said the network recognized early on the significance of the 2018 midterm elections, and executives committed to \u201cblow out all of prime time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a big shift from 2014, when ABC, NBC and CBS devoted only an hour in prime time to midterm results. This year, all three broadcast networks are running from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Tuesday, along with extensive coverage online.\n\nAnthony Salvanto, the CBS News elections and surveys director, said any problems in 2016 resulted from too much focus on the horse race at the expense of the bigger picture. He said he did not think CBS fell prey to that issue, but his network\u2019s goal will be to see the evening as \u201ca range of possibilities.\u201d\n\nPart of the issue two years ago, he said, resulted from focusing too much on national polls showing Clinton to be ahead \u2014 a projection that, in the end, was born out but did not matter much. For similar reasons, he said, CBS has been focused on seat-by-seat results, as opposed to generic ballot polls.\n\nFox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt said another big mistake in 2016 was that many news organizations dismissed the possibility of Trump winning, even as polls indicated he had a roughly 20 percent chance of victory. \u201cIf somebody told you there was a 1 in 5 chance that an airplane was going to crash, you would not get on the airplane,\u201d Stirewalt said.\n\nStirewalt stressed that news organizations shouldn\u2019t leave viewers with the impression that, for example, Democrats will certainly win the House when they point out the probability that will happen. \u201cI\u2019m sort of like the weatherman,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not in control of the storm. But I can tell you where on the map it\u2019s likely to go.\u201d\n\nAfter frustrations with 2016 exit polls, Fox News broke with other networks in creating the Fox News Voter Analysis , a new method of analyzing voting behavior that Stirewalt said will allow reporters and anchors to \u201ctalk about things with a level of detail and nuance,\u201d including looking at who did not vote Tuesday.\n\nFeist said CNN's preparations are similar to previous major elections, but he said the network has retooled for a broadcast that he thinks will receive more attention than any midterm before it. \u201cWe have completely reprogrammed the magic wall from the ground up,\u201d he said, referring to the giant monitor with maps that CNN uses in its election coverage, in order to be more nimble in breaking down specific House races.\n\nTracking the 500-some races in play Tuesday is a much more complicated affair than a presidential year, when the main focus is clear. Having worked through so many scenarios, Feist said CNN was making no assumptions about how Tuesday night would go: \u201cOur tools don\u2019t have a preference to whether the Democrats or Republicans win the House or the Senate.\u201d\n\nRashida Jones, senior vice president of specials for NBC News and MSNBC, echoed other executives in warning against predictions. The strategy for Tuesday, she said, is to \u201cguide the viewers through a big night\u201d while \u201cbeing focused on telling them what\u2019s happening in real time.\u201d\n\nAs NBC devotes three hours in prime time to midterms coverage, MSNBC is planning for 42 hours of live programming beginning with \u201cMorning Joe First Look\u201d at 5 a.m. Tuesday. \u201cThis go-around looks much more like a presidential election,\u201d said Jones, who noted that NBC and MSNBC have 25 correspondents fanned out across the country.\n\n\u201cWhere we are now is just so different from four, eight years ago,\u201d the Post\u2019s Ginsberg said regarding the past two midterm elections. The Post has two dozen journalists across the country, Ginsberg said, along with several dozen working from the office on election night.\n\nGinsberg said the \u201ctakeaway from 2016 is that we should be careful about the metrics we use to judge election results.\u201d Journalists will continue to look at polling, money spent in races and other metrics \u2014 but as guidance. Ginsberg said he was \u201chappy going into Election Day not knowing what the result will be.\u201d\n\nHealy said Times reporters would be careful not to let prewritten material \u2014 which reporters facing tight deadlines often prepare \u2014 lock them into storylines that could turn on a dime. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to find ourselves at 11:45 p.m. with the narrative of the night about to take a sharp turn and not have a story that can get put together very quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nAmid all the criticism of 2016 coverage, Healy said his top priority has been making sure that the Times reports on the full range of voters \u2014 from all types of conservatives and liberals to third-party voters and independents \u2014 so that the results, whatever they are, can be thoroughly explained.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s been a real determination here to get this right tomorrow night,\u201d he said on Monday. \u201cNot being predictive, but to feel like we\u2019ve covered the country and voters and President Trump in a way that really illuminates what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n", "Despite the controversies surrounding him, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has continued to pitch himself for more prominent jobs in Trump\u2019s administration, a former White House official said. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo Energy & Environment Trump hedges Zinke support amid probes\n\nPresident Donald Trump offered less-than-effusive praise Monday for embattled Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, while saying he might not \u201cbe happy\u201d with the outcomes of the investigations into Zinke\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cI'm going to look at any reports, I'll take a look,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked whether he was troubled by recent news reports about Zinke, which have included a potential Justice Department criminal investigation and growing scrutiny of a land deal involving the chairman of Halliburton. \u201cCertainly, I would not be happy with that at all. But I will take a look. But he has done a very good job as secretary.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump\u2019s words fell short of the glowing tributes he offered last spring to a similarly troubled Cabinet member \u2014 Scott Pruitt, then the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 whom he credited with achieving \u201cRecord clean Air & Water\u201d and saving taxpayers \u201cBillions of Dollars.\u201d And they come amid growing signs that Zinke\u2019s hold on his job may be as tenuous as it was for Pruitt, who resigned in July under multiple inquiries into his spending, tight relations with lobbyists and reliance on government perks.\n\nAllies inside and outside the administration have begun to distance themselves from Zinke. But even as those problems mushroomed, a former White House official told POLITICO on Monday, Zinke continued to pitch himself for more prominent jobs in Trump\u2019s administration \u2014 including as a possible replacement for Pruitt at EPA.\n\nThe White House and the Interior Department did not respond to further questions Monday, although the former official said Trump still likes Zinke\u2019s bluntness and charisma.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

There\u2019s a perception that he worked really quickly, and for a while there was a reputation that he had the ear of the president.\u201d\n\nMultiple sources described the Navy veteran as an ambitious Cabinet member who has long been eyeing his next gig as he tries to implement Trump\u2019s \u201cenergy dominance\u201d agenda, chiefly by removing regulations on drilling, mining and fracking. Allies have said he also may be interested in running for higher office in coming years \u2014 and the Montana governor\u2019s seat will come up in 2020.\n\nThe investigations may pose an unknown threat to all that. Those include one probe that, according to news reports, the Interior Department\u2019s inspector general referred late last month to the Justice Department, which could weigh whether to bring criminal charges.\n\nThe IG\u2019s office and DOJ have declined to comment on the referral. But potential subjects include a Montana real estate development that involves a Zinke-created foundation and Halliburton Chairman David Lesar, whose company stands to gain from Interior\u2019s decisions to expand onshore and offshore drilling. POLITICO first reported on that deal, as well as on a meeting that Zinke had with Lesar at Interior Department headquarters last year before discussing the development project over dinner.\n\nZinke continued to contact a Whitefish city planner about the land in question even after becoming secretary, a potential breach of his ethics pledge, The Washington Post reported Monday based on a newly released email.\n\nThe IG has also been examining Interior\u2019s refusal to grant a casino license to two Native American tribes in Connecticut, a move that followed lobbying from MGM Resorts International and its supporters in Congress.\n\nA recent inspector general report also found that Zinke tried to make his wife, Lola, a \u201cvolunteer\u201d at Interior so she could travel with him for free at department expense. In addition, Zinke took political donors on official tours and cost taxpayers $25,000 by bringing a security detail on a vacation with his wife to the Mediterranean region, according to the report.\n\nLola Zinke\u2019s frequent travel on official Interior business had caused staffers other problems.\n\nIn one previously unreported incident from May 28, 2017, Interior travel scheduler Timothy Nigborowicz canceled a charter flight scheduled for the next day to take Zinke from McKinley National Park Airport to Anchorage, according to emails POLITICO obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nIn the emails, Nigborowicz said no reason was given for the cancellation. But an email from Interior employee Tim Fox a month later says it was because of issues getting clearance for Zinke\u2019s wife to board the flight.\n\n\u201cI was at the [Interior\u2019s Alaska regional director] meeting yesterday and learned that the flight was cancelled because Sec. Zinke\u2019s wife was going to travel with him and there was no way to do that with the [solicitor\u2019s office] approval,\u201d Fox wrote to department flight coordinator Shari Moultrie in a June 2017 email. \u201cThey ended up driving which added about 6 hours to the trip.\u201d\n\nInterior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort dismissed the email as \u201cjust gossip between two people who weren\u2019t involved in the decision-making process.\u201d", "Analysts cautioned against drawing broad conclusions about which party could gain an advantage from high early vote totals. | Jim Mone/AP Photo Elections A staggering 36 million people have voted early, setting the stage for big midterm turnout The turnout could be a source of error in pre-election surveys if pollsters did not calibrate properly for such high rates of voting.\n\nA staggering 36 million voters cast their ballots ahead of Election Day this year, setting the stage for much-higher-than-usual turnout for a midterm \u2014 and, potentially, big surprises on Tuesday night.\n\nRepublican enthusiasm for President Donald Trump and Democrats\u2019 itch to repudiate him at the ballot box have driven people to the polls far faster than in 2014, when 27.2 million people voted early, according to Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who tracks voter turnout.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd that trend was expected to extend into Election Day. Early voters in three states \u2014 Texas, Nevada and Arizona \u2014 have surpassed total turnout in the most recent midterm election, McDonald\u2019s data show, and more states will blow past their normal non-presidential turnout with just a handful more votes on Election Day. The high voting rates have transformed expectations about who will show up in the midterms \u2014 and they could inspire results that diverge from any pre-election polls that did not reckon with this year\u2019s unusually high enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThis is not a normal election,\u201d McDonald told POLITICO. \u201cThe best guess is that we\u2019re looking at some sort of hybrid midterm/presidential election\u201d in terms of turnout.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMcDonald predicted that by the time all the early votes are compiled, every state could surpass its 2014 totals. Tom Bonier, CEO of the Democratic data firm TargetSmart, projected that early voting could surpass 40 million when all the ballots are received.\n\nAnalysts cautioned against drawing broad conclusions about which party could gain an advantage from the high early-vote totals. But they did note that pre-election polls make built-in assumptions about how many people will vote, and pollsters who leaned too heavily on past midterm turnout may have misfired.\n\nMcDonald and the team at Edison Media Research, which is conducting a revamped exit poll this election after stumbling in 2016, predict that 105.5 million people will vote this year \u2014 about 45 percent of the voting eligible population. That\u2019s up from 2014, an unusually low-turnout year in which fewer than 82 million people voted for the highest office on their ballot, but still lower than 2016, when about 137 million people voted for president.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve all made a very safe assumption that 2018 will look nothing like 2014,\u201d Bonier said, noting that underestimating certain demographics by even a few percentage points in a poll could have outsize effects on the results.\n\nSome pollsters, like Monmouth University and The New York Times/Siena College, have adjusted this year by publishing multiple results for each poll, detailing how the results would change under different turnout scenarios. And the baseline estimates have gone up in recent weeks: The first Times/Siena poll of Rep. Pete Sessions\u2019 (R-Texas) contested reelection race, for example, projected that about 194,000 people would turn out, while the second poll projected 211,000 voters would cast ballots in that slice of the Dallas suburbs.\n\nOver 188,000 voters have cast early ballots in the Dallas County portion of the battleground district, according to county data. (Another 7 percent of the district\u2019s population is in another county that has not published early vote totals by congressional seat.)\n\nHigher-than-expected turnout helped Democrats in some but not all of the Times/Siena polling models.\n\nMara Suttmann, a professor of government at Connecticut College, noted that it\u2019s hard to predict which party will benefit from early voting because many voters would have voted whether or not early voting was an option \u2014 \u201ccannibalizing\u201d the Election Day vote instead of adding many new voters to the electorate.\n\nBonier noted that there has been in a surge in non-usual voters, including young people and people voting for the first time, which could favor Democrats. But even this does not guarantee electoral success for Democrats on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe open question that won\u2019t be answered until [results are in]: Do those early vote trends carry on through Election Day?\u201d Bonier asked. \u201cOr are they reversed? In 2016, in a lot of cases, they were reversed. I don\u2019t think you can bet one way or another at this point.\u201d\n\nThese low-propensity voters still make up a small portion of both the early voter electorate and the expected overall electorate. Data from TargetSmart show that early voters younger than 39 are still easily outnumbered by voters aged 50-64, and even more so by voters 65 and older.\n\nAnd even in states where Democrats lead Republicans in early ballots cast \u2014 like Florida, where the gubernatorial and Senate races are close \u2014 the election is still far from over.\n\n\u201cWe know Election Day is going to come in strong for the Republicans,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very traditional thing in most states that have early voting options.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s still a likely majority of votes to be cast on Election Day.\n\n\u201cWe may see another 60 million votes cast [on Election Day]. Most people who will have ended up voting in this election have still not voted,\u201d Bonier said. \u201cIn the end, what happens on Election Day turnout will, to some extent, swamp what happened in the early vote.\u201d", "Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Employment & Immigration Trump administration presses Supreme Court to intervene in DACA cases\n\nThe Justice Department on Monday petitioned the Supreme Court to intervene in several cases over the termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nThe move comes on the eve of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections \u2014 and after weeks of fiery anti-immigration rhetoric from President Donald Trump.

And Hillary Clinton, even though she fell short in the Electoral College, received 3 million more votes than her white male opponent. Yet Michael Avenatti, who is exploring a presidential run of his own, told Time magazine in a recent interview that only a white man could beat President Donald Trump in 2020, \u201cbecause of where the electorate lines up and where Trump\u2019s strengths lie,\u201d though he also stressed that \u201cit shouldn\u2019t be that way\u201d in an ideal world.\n\nWhile noting that nonwhite males can and have won elections against people not named Trump, Avenatti went on to say that, in general, \u201cI think it\u2019s different when you have a white male making the arguments.

There are more than 40 competitive House races pitting a nonwhite or nonmale Democrat against a white male Republican, as well four Senate races and eight gubernatorial races\u2014that\u2019s nearly half of the competitive gubernatorial races. Not since 2002, when Democrats elected three female governors, has the party had such a strong field of female gubernatorial candidates.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get one thing out of the way. Yes, Avenatti\u2019s provocative comments were largely confined to a presidential election involving Trump. But a midterm election is a referendum on the president, at least in part. And this president hovers over this midterm like no other, vacuuming up the national media coverage and lobbing culture war bombs that inflame our debates over race and gender. Further, the Republican slate of candidates is heavy with white males and Trump loyalists. How women and people of color candidates fare in this environment will shed some light over how they would fare in 2020.\n\nWith so many candidates who are not white men on the ballot Tuesday, it\u2019s a near-certainty that there will be some barrier-breaking success stories. But will they happen in the predominantly white working-class areas of the country that determined the outcome of the 2016 presidential race, and could do so again in 2020?\n\nFor example, Democrat Mikie Sherrill is primed to flip New Jersey \u2018s 11th Congressional District after 34 years in Republican hands. She\u2019s led every poll. She holds a sizable money advantage. She has a strong personal story as a former Navy pilot. And she\u2019s elevated the unfavorables of her white male opponent, Jay Webber, with an ad campaign that hammers him for what she says are retrograde views on equal pay for women and gay rights. But she\u2019s running in a district Trump won by only a hair. And unlike most of Trump\u2019s turf, a majority of the district\u2019s residents are college graduates, and therefore tend to be more culturally liberal. The gender card may work for Democrats here, yet not in the places where it really counts two years from now.\n\nWith those demographic factors in mind, keep a close eye on these 25 races. They\u2019ll give us the hardest evidence yet of how well Democratic women and people of color candidates fare in Trump\u2019s America.\n\nThe Female Pragmatists\n\nTwo Democratic women appear poised to flip Midwestern House districts that Trump won narrowly two years ago: Angie Craig (in Minnesota\u2019s 2nd District) and Abby Finkenauer (in Iowa\u2019s 1st). Both are rated \u201cLean Democrat\u201d in POLITICO\u2019s projections. They are running as bipartisan pragmatists against men with deeply conservative pedigrees.\n\nCraig has the most Trump-like opponent, first-term incumbent Rep. Jason Lewis. Once dubbed \u201cMinnesota\u2019s Mini-Trump\u201d by the Atlantic, Lewis was a radio talk show host who said on-air that women who prioritized insurance coverage of contraception were \u201cwithout a brain,\u201d and \u201cthe chances today of a gang of KKK members beating up a black kid are remote compared to the opposite.\u201d\n\nIn the waning days of the campaign, both Craig and the Democratic-affiliated House Majority PAC are focusing less on race and gender in favor of blasting Lewis for having \u201cgone Washington\u201d and taking money from \u201cspecial interests\u201d and then giving them a \u201cmassive tax break\u201d (a reference to the 2017 tax reform law) that will balloon the national debt.\n\nFinkenauer, running in a district with fewer college diplomas than in New Jersey\u2019s 11th or Minnesota\u2019s 2nd, is also betting on her working-class roots. She was raised in a union household\u2014her father a pipe fitter\u2013welder, her mother a public school employee. Her ads are flecked with testimonials from blue-collar workers, and she cites her farmer sister\u2019s struggle to sell crops abroad when criticizing Trump\u2019s tariffs (though she blames incumbent Rep. Rod Blum by name for the trade war, not Trump).\n\nSeveral other Democratic women are in \u201ctoss-up\u201d races on what was Trump turf: Cindy Axne (Iowa\u2019s 3rd), Lauren Underwood (Illinois\u2019 14th), Amy McGrath (Kentucky\u2019s 6th), Elissa Slotkin (Michigan\u2019s 8th), Elaine Luria (Virginia\u2019s 2nd) and Abigail Spanberger (Virginia\u2019s 7th). They are also portraying themselves as bipartisan pragmatists, and their opponents as tools of the special interests.\n\nNone of these districts have a majority of residents with college degrees. Unsurprisingly, even though all of these candidates support abortion rights, they\u2019re not emphasizing social issues. Time magazine even reported that while Axne could talk more about how she once fought off a knife-wielding rapist and associate herself strongly with the #MeToo movement, she doesn\u2019t bring it up on the trail.\n\nThese female candidates are not suffering the sort of bombastic misogynistic attacks that Trump leveled on Hillary Clinton, but one can detect whiffs of sexism in Republican attack ads. Craig is portrayed as \u201cangry and unhinged,\u201d with the help of a clip from a speech to the party faithful in which Craig loudly says she is \u201cpissed.\u201d Finkenauer, an Iowa state representative, is mocked for softness for once saying, \u201cI legislate with my heart too much.\u201d Slotkin, a former acting assistant secretary of Defense, is called \u201ctotally unqualified\u201d on national security (that was a 2014 quote from the late Sen. John McCain, who opposed her official confirmation to the post; the McCain family criticized its use for 2018 campaign purposes.) Underwood, who is African-American, was hit with an attack ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee that uses an image of her with skin of a much darker hue than she actually has.\n\nIf any of these women triumphs by going high as their opponents went low, score one for Michelle Obama over Michael Avenatti.\n\nThe Racism Neutralizers\n\nThere are two men of color running in \u201ctoss-up\u201d House races where Trump won two years ago: Antonio Delgado (New York\u2019s 19th) and Andy Kim (New Jersey\u2019s 3rd). Both have been hit with overtly racist attacks, with Delgado suffering the most sustained barrage\u2014ad after ad caricaturing the corporate attorney as a \u201crapper\u201d who doesn\u2019t share \u201cour values.\u201d\n\nIn the summer, Delgado accused the Republican incumbent, Rep. John Faso, for having a \u201cdated mind-set \u2026 to suggest that if you\u2019re black or if you\u2019re of a certain race, you can\u2019t be of this community.\u201d But for the most part, Delgado is indirectly responding with ads that feature working-class whites who testify to his values and economic policies. Similarly, Underwood \u201chas not made the issue of race and identity politics central to her campaign,\u201d according to ABC News, \u201cInstead, Underwood is running a fairly moderate campaign focused on pocketbook issues.\u201d\n\nA much more confrontational approach is being taken by African-American Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum. During a debate televised on CNN, he fired up progressive social media when he rebuked the Republican nominee, Ron DeSantis, for the support he has received from racist corners: \u201cI'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist. I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\u201d\n\nA somewhat less edgy but still pointed attack is coming from Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who could become the first-ever African-American woman governor. She is blitzing her Republican opponent Brian Kemp, who in his capacity as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state is being accused of trying to kick African-Americans off the voter rolls on technicalities, as an \u201carchitect of voter suppression.\u201d Monday on CNN, Abrams dismissed Kemp\u2019s attempt to disavow a racist robocall attack on her, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s a little late for him to repudiate racist remarks given that he\u2019s stood with someone wearing an anti-Islam T-shirt.\u201d\n\nGillum and Abrams are running campaigns in more racially diverse territory than are Delgado, Kim and Underwood, and they face more controversial opponents. But recall that President Barack Obama kept such an even keel in the wake of the racist \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theories that Comedy Central\u2019s Key & Peele suggested Obama needed an \u201canger translator\u201d to vent his true feelings. If Gillum or Abrams wins by utilizing a confrontational approach, that may alter the political calculations of future African-American candidates.\n\nThe White Male Brigade\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 2018 field may be the most diverse ever: White men are a minority of their House and gubernatorial candidates. But will those white men get a strong reception from voters? If many women and people of color candidates fall short of expectations, while Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, South Dakota gubernatorial candidate Billie Sutton, Iowa gubernatorial candidate Fred Hubbell, Utah 4th\u2019s Ben McAdams and Indiana 2nd\u2019s Mel Hall upset their female Republican opponents, that will bolster Avenatti\u2019s argument. Also watch West Virginia 3rd\u2019s Richard Ojeda, who is partially of Mexican descent. Ojeda is running perhaps the most testosterone-fueled Democratic campaign of 2018; his signature ad is titled, \u201cANGRY.\u201d\n\nThe Incumbency Question for Women Running Statewide\n\nThe possibility exists that Democratic women incumbents will have a tough Tuesday. Two of the most endangered Democratic incumbents are women in the Senate: North Dakota\u2019s Heidi Heitkamp and Missouri\u2019s Claire McCaskill. Two others previously thought to be vulnerable, Wisconsin\u2019s Tammy Baldwin and Michigan\u2019s Debbie Stabenow, appear to have comfortable leads, though neither is facing a white man.\n\nThe ranks of female Democratic governors are already thin, and one presumed to have been a lock for reelection, Oregon\u2019s Kate Brown, is now scrambling to keep power against a little-known, white male Republican. Brown, who first ascended to office when her predecessor resigned in scandal, is not known for charisma. And as one supporter told the New York Times, \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018I don\u2019t feel energized by her.\u2019 People don\u2019t say that about male candidates.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Tuesday could be a big night for female gubernatorial candidates who are not incumbents: Along with Georgia\u2019s Stacey Abrams, Michigan\u2019s Gretchen Whitmer, New Mexico\u2019s Michelle Lujan Grisham, Kansas\u2019 Laura Kelly and Maine\u2019s Janet Mills all have a reasonable shot of victory over white male Republicans in open seat races. And with a big enough Blue Wave, New Hampshire\u2019s Molly Kelly has an outside shot of toppling incumbent Gov. Chris Sununu. (And a really big Blue Wave might carry the first transgender woman into a governorship, as Democrat Christine Hallquist faces an uphill battle against Vermont\u2019s Republican incumbent, Phil Scott.) If the female fresh faces, several of whom are in red states, have a better night than the incumbents from similar states, that raises the troubling question whether voters are less willing to cut women slack than men, once they get their hands dirty from the realities of governing.\n\nWith so many nonwhite and nonmale Democrats on the ballot Tuesday, some will win and some will lose. And the reasons for those wins and losses may less about because of their identities, but the partisan lean of the national electorate or local quirks. It may well be that race or gender not only can be, but should be, rendered irrelevant to the question of electability.\n\nBut as most people would readily acknowledge, America has not been cleansed of racism and sexism. We have been disabused of any hope that Obama\u2019s election would quickly usher in a \u201cpost-racial\u201d society. And one of the challenging questions for Democrats who are committed to combating bigotry is: Should it be confronted head-on by continuing to nominate candidates who are either nonwhite or nonmale (or both) for the presidency, or, adhering to Avenatti\u2019s argument, is 2020 a time in history when a white man is going to do more to advance the cause?\n\nDemocrats confronted this question in the 2008 primary between the African-American Obama, the female Hillary Clinton and the white male former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. As one Edwards supporter in Iowa bluntly put it: \u201cCertain areas of the country are not going to vote for [Clinton or Obama.] We're still a male chauvinist-type state, and to some extent we are kind of a racist country.\u201d Edwards himself was more subtle, only saying he was the \u201cmost electable candidate\u201d because he \u201ccan go to every corner of America.\u201d\n\nEdwards was wrong. Obama won decisively, picking off several previously red, and predominantly white, states in the process.\n\nAnd Obama\u2019s 2008 victory came after a successful test case from the 2006 midterms: Deval Patrick in the Massachusetts gubernatorial race. Patrick was the only Democrat to be Massachusetts governor since Michael Dukakis left office at the end of 1990. And he achieved that goal with the help of political strategist David Axelrod, who subsequently navigated Obama\u2019s presidential run. A 2007 New York Times Magazine profile of Axelrod by Ben Wallace-Wells summed up the parallels: \u201cThere are many ways in which Patrick\u2019s run and Obama\u2019s are similar: the optimism, the constant presence of the candidate\u2019s biography, the combination of a crusading message of reform with the candidate\u2019s natural pragmatism, the insistence that normal political categories did not apply, even the same, unofficial slogan, shouted from the crowds \u2014 \u2018Yes. We. Can!\u2019 But most essential is the way in which both of these campaigns came to use the symbolism that accompanies their candidates\u2019 race, not by apologizing for it or ignoring it but by embracing the constant attention paid to the historic nature of the candidacy itself.\u201d Perhaps there will be a Patrick-like candidate on Tuesday who presents a model for how to win in 2020.\n\nAvenatti\u2019s argument for how to defeat Trump is presented as an inconvenient truth, and maybe it is. Maybe a candidate like Obama can win when the economy is the overriding issue, but a candidate like Trump activates latent bigoted tendencies in voters, creating too high a bar for candidates who aren\u2019t white men to clear.\n\nOf course, Avenatti could be simply mansplaining for self-serving purposes. In fairness to Avenatti, he said \u201cI might be wrong\u201d and \u201cI wish this were not true,\u201d But those who want to prove him wrong will still have to accept his underlying point\u2014that Trump expertly exploits the reality that we don\u2019t live in a society free of racism and sexism\u2014and look for examples of candidates who cannily and creatively overcame those obstacles. Any Democratic candidate who successfully meets that challenge Tuesday will give champions of diversity and equality newfound reasons to hope in 2020, and beyond.\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, and co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \u201cThe DMZ.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Donald Trump\n\n2018 Elections", "Senate Leadership Fund invested six figures on digital ads in Nevada where it has been working to reelect GOP Sen.

Bush administrations interviewed by POLITICO. Their assessments offer a gut-churning preview of what\u2019s in store for Trump administration officials should Democrats wield gavels come January.\n\nWhite House staffers can expect to work past midnight battling congressional committees, wage exhausting fights over redactions to internal documents, suffer through mind-numbing meetings with government lawyers about the nuances of executive privilege and see their memos and emails leaked to the media by freshly empowered Democratic investigators.\n\nOne former Clinton administration official compared the experience to getting dental work without anesthesia. A former Obama administration aide described the period after Republicans regained control of the House in 2010 as \u201cexcruciating.\u201d A former Bush administration official said it was one of the most demoralizing times of his career.\n\n\u201cI remember coming out of the White House one day in August and realizing it was the first time I\u2019d been outside when the sun was still up in a long time,\u201d recalled veteran Democratic strategist Chris Lehane, who worked on crisis communications in the Clinton White House as it was grappling with the Whitewater scandal.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

But former administration officials said the Trump White House itself has enjoyed only a taste of the hostile scrutiny to which Democrats would treat it.\n\nTrump\u2019s White House may have it even worse next year because of a rule change the House GOP approved near the end of the Obama administration granting unilateral subpoena power to all committee chairs, forgoing committee votes. \u201cI suspect they\u2019re not going to ratchet that back,\u201d former Obama White House counsel Neil Eggleston said of a potential House Democratic majority.\n\nFormer administration officials said losing at least one chamber of Congress \u2014 much as Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did midway through their first terms, and Bush did in his second \u2014 transformed their daily lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s depressing as hell,\u201d said Leon Panetta, former chief of staff to Clinton. \u201cThat\u2019s the first thing that hit the White House, the fact that the American people didn\u2019t like everything that the president was doing. The president\u2019s morale was pretty down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re fighting what is really a political battle,\u201d recalled one Obama White House lawyer. \u201cYou\u2019re operating in a highly, highly partisan, political environment.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats launch investigations, heretofore anonymous Trump officials can look forward to 15 minutes of unwelcome political fame as their private emails and memos are swept up in congressional document requests. During the Obama administration, for example, relatively unknown government workers \u2014 from IRS official Lois Lerner to White House energy aide Heather Zichal \u2014 saw their internal emails become national news as they were dragged before Congress.\n\nStaffers also fretted that getting pulled into a congressional investigation would mean having to hire a personal lawyer and distractions from their day jobs.\n\n\u201cAm I going to be off my game because I have to worry about this?\u201d was a common refrain in the administration, Eggleston said. \u201cAm I suddenly now going to get sucked into the vortex of this? That\u2019s a very debilitating feeling that hits people, and that\u2019s very real.\u201d\n\nAnother Obama White House lawyer said staffers sometimes spent days prepping nervous colleagues for congressional testimony.\n\n\u201cIt is an incredibly, incredibly nerve-wracking process to be involved in,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nDemocrats have a long list of investigative targets \u2014 from outstanding questions about the Trump campaign\u2019s 2016 contacts with Russia to policy decisions on multiple issues to the well-documented alleged ethical lapses of several Cabinet officials.\n\nDemocrats have also signaled plans to subpoena Trump\u2019s tax returns, and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee has said he wants to explore allegations that the Trump Organization has been a haven for money laundering.\n\nSome Democrats warn against overreach, saying that Trump \u2014 much like presidents before him \u2014 will be quick to claim the opposition is abusing its power. Obama officials believed they were able to portray a House Republican fixation with the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, which led to hours of hearings and thousands of email disclosures, as politically motivated persecution.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump likes to be in the role of victim \u2026 Now he\u2019ll actually have real bogeymen who are issuing subpoenas and document requests,\u201d said Andrew Wright, an Obama White House lawyer. \u201cIf they come in and harangue witnesses and treat them shabbily, then that could turn more people off.

The formula includes establishing a dedicated team of anywhere from a dozen to two dozen staffers who can forge relationships with congressional investigators, respond to their document requests and \u2014 perhaps most important \u2014 develop an offensive strategy to discredit the incoming probes.\n\n\u201cIt went from white shoes to brass knuckles,\u201d another former Obama administration official said of the shift in the type of lawyers who were hired to work in the White House after Democrats lost the House in the 2010 midterms.\n\nA similar scenario played out after the November 1994 elections, when Democrats lost both the House and the Senate in a stunning blow midway through Clinton\u2019s first term.\n\nIn response, Panetta recruited lawyer Jane Sherburne to lead a scandal-response team that ballooned to about 15 people, including lawyers from the White House counsel\u2019s office, legislative affairs staffers and press aides.\n\nBush had loyalists running his White House counsel\u2019s office during his first six years, first with Alberto Gonzalez and then Harriet Miers. But after losing the House and Senate in the 2006 midterms, the Republican president shifted to Fred Fielding, a veteran GOP scandal handler who had served as White House counsel during President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term.\n\nIn an email to POLITICO, Fielding predicted the Trump White House recalibration if Democrats win the House \u201cwould be, at least on paper, a carbon copy of what I inherited in Bush 43, as well as earlier adventures.\u201d\n\nObama also had to shift course after losing the House in 2010. His first two White House counsels were Greg Craig, who was known for his expertise on national security matters, and Bob Bauer, who served as the 2008 Obama campaign attorney. But after Republicans took the House, Obama turned in succession to two attorneys with specific experience in handling investigations: Kathryn Ruemmler and then Eggleston.\n\nPeople close to Trump privately worry the current White House is not prepared for life with a Democratic House.\n\nTrump currently lacks a permanent White House counsel. His pick for the job, Pat Cipollone, is still undergoing a background check and is not expected to start in a full-time capacity until mid-November.\n\n\u201cI think the new guy has to get into place before they start\u201d hiring new lawyers, said C. Boyden Gray, the former White House counsel for President George H.W. Bush who noted that his entire four-year tenure involved dealing with Democratic oversight from both the House and Senate.\n\nInside the White House, preparations for a Democratic House are expected to kick into gear after the midterms, should Democrats win the majority. Aides refused to discuss their plans in detail, insisting that a House Democratic takeover is not a given.\n\nTrump allies acknowledge the president \u2014 who has spent less than two years in Washington and has known only a GOP Congress \u2014 would be learning on the fly when dealing with a Congress run by Democrats. But they add that Trump\u2019s history of political warfare could make him an unusually formidable foe for Hill investigators.\n\n\u201cMost people have never been through this. Many of the staff in the White House have never been through a congressional hearing,\u201d said Harold Ickes, a former deputy chief of staff in the Clinton White House. Ickes recalled dealing with more than 30 subpoenas and requests for his testimony.\n\nTrump\u2019s political team also would have its hands full on the investigative front, Ickes said. Recalling his work in the Clinton White House as it geared up for the 1996 reelection campaign, Ickes cited donors who needed to be reassured the president would make it through the investigations, as well as elected officials and other allies who were concerned the scandals enveloping the president would tar them and their own electoral prospects.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much you try to wall it off,\u201d Ickes said, \u201cit\u2019s still very distracting and time consuming.\u201d\n\nFormer Clinton White House counsel Jack Quinn said his worst day on the job came in 1996 when the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee voted to hold him in contempt of Congress for not turning over documents tied to the firing of White House travel office personnel.\n\n\u201cThere were more than a few days after that,\u201d Quinn said, \u201cwhen I drove to work at the White House wondering why Republicans on Capitol Hill whom I'd never met and who had never heard me out wanted to ruin my life.\u201d", "Republicans believe House Democrats are playing fast and loose with campaign finance law, abetted by a sclerotic FEC that rarely cracks down on potential violations. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Legal House Dem candidates snag free office rent Party lawyers get creative with campaign finance law.\n\nHouse Democrats have exploited campaign finance law to pay rent for dozens of campaign offices used by their candidates in 2018 \u2014 an arrangement that's further padded the party's massive financial advantage in the midterms even as Republicans cry foul.\n\nA number of House Democratic candidates haven't paid a dime to rent the buildings where they based their campaign operations, according to a POLITICO review of Federal Election Commission records. Others rented space earlier this year but suddenly stopped some or all of the payments after winning their primaries. In their place, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee picked up the tab \u2014 paying over $1 million in office rent to property managers and limited liability companies in 22 states over the past two years, the committee's FEC reports show.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe spending on 52 offices around the country, known internally as DCCC \u201cBattlestations,\" comes from a special fund established under a 2014 law that the DCCC can use only to maintain party headquarters buildings \u2014 not for other conventional campaign activities. The FEC has never issued regulations interpreting the law and saying exactly how the \u201cheadquarters funds\u201d can be used, or whether this use of them is appropriate.\n\nDespite the lack of regulatory certainty, the DCCC\u2019s Battlestations sprouted up around the country before this election. The move came with the blessing of the committee\u2019s lead attorney, Marc Elias, who helped congressional leaders write the law that established the party building funds. The statute's language specifies that party groups like the DCCC could operate multiple headquarters around the country.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHouse Republicans do not have a similar program, and their lawyers have been more conservative in their interpretation of the 2014 law so far, according to two Republican officials.\n\nThe arrangement is a case study in House Democrats\u2019 yearslong efforts to conceive new legal avenues for party money to flow to often-cash-strapped candidates, according to interviews with Democratic strategists, regulatory filings and campaign spending reports. While the DCCC can use \u201cheadquarters fund\u201d money only for limited purposes, Democratic candidates can use the money saved on office space for advertising or other efforts to win votes.\n\n\u201cThey are looking for every way possible to take costs off the candidates\u2019 books,\u201d said one Democratic operative, who requested anonymity to discuss internal party strategy.\n\nThe Battlestations have to hew to certain rules, according to internal DCCC legal guidelines described to POLITICO. The offices must be available for use by Democratic candidates up and down the ballot, not just House campaigns, and they have to be open for long stretches of the campaign, not just as temporary staging areas for volunteers or late get-out-the-vote efforts. They have to be identified on signs as DCCC buildings and have committee employees working there.\n\nThe offices are essentially treated by the Democratic Party as extensions of the DCCC headquarters in Washington, D.C., where challengers and incumbents regularly use the national party facilities without paying rent or triggering limits on in-kind contributions from parties to candidates.\n\nThe arrangement has frustrated Republicans who believe House Democrats are playing fast and loose with campaign finance law, abetted by a sclerotic FEC that rarely cracks down on potential violations.\n\n\u201cEvery cycle it seems they\u2019re writing new rules for themselves, and it\u2019s insanely frustrating because they also yell so much about reforming campaign finance,\u201d one Republican official said.\n\nBut Democrats believe they are on solid footing. Elias outlined a legal argument that underpins the DCCC Battlestation program in a 2016 letter to the FEC asking the commission to establish regulations regarding the headquarters funds and other new party accounts established by the 2014 law.\n\nCiting the text of the law and \u201cstatements of congressional intent\u201d from former Speaker John Boehner and ex-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Democratic attorney noted that the law referred to \u201cheadquarters buildings\u201d in plural and asked the FEC to \u201cdefine a \u2018headquarters building\u2019 to be any building from which the party manages activity or directly controls party operations\u201d \u2014 as the DCCC now does with field programs and other aspects of House campaigns from its Battlestation offices.\n\nElias himself was involved in drafting the new law, POLITICO reported in 2014. A small section tacked onto the end of a must-pass spending bill, it allowed the House, Senate and national party committees to raise additional money from donors above the normal contribution limits for special funds that can be used only to pay for party headquarters, recounts and national conventions.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a series of cost-saving campaign finance innovations that the DCCC has deployed with its candidates in recent elections. In 2016, the Democratic committee spent millions of dollars in conjunction with candidates on TV ads that linked House Republicans to Donald Trump. Republicans complained to the FEC that the spending broke the $48,100 limit on \u201ccoordinated\u201d spending between party groups and candidates.\n\nBut the FEC dismissed the complaint after the DCCC outlined its strategy: The House Democratic committee was paying the cost of the parts of the ads that mentioned Trump, and Democratic candidates were paying the cost of the portions that mentioned congressional candidates. It was a useful way for the DCCC to send candidates more money and get more bang for its own bucks. Instead of paying the higher outside-group rate to air its own ads, the DCCC money went to ads for which the candidates paid lower rates to local TV stations, thanks to federal regulations.\n\nThe DCCC has reprised its cost-sharing strategy on Trump ads in a handful of districts this year, spending millions of dollars in coordination with candidates like Illinois Democrat Sean Casten, whose ads have linked Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) to Trump.\n\nThe ads prompted consternation among Republicans, many of whom were already getting outspent by cash-flush Democratic candidates and now had extra money from the DCCC raining down on them.\n\nBut like many campaign finance innovations, its success has bred imitation.\n\nIn October, the NRCC began spending money with candidates on its own ads linking Democrats to unpopular members of their own party. Roskam has gotten one of the biggest boosts: His campaign and the NRCC have spent approximately $3 million together on TV ads in the pricey Chicago media market, linking Casten to longtime Democratic state House Speaker Mike Madigan, according to Advertising Analytics.", "President Donald Trump campaigns Monday alongside Republican Mike Braun, who is running to unseat Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Elections Trump scrambles to save the Senate The president continued his campaign blitz amid late polls pointing to Democratic momentum in key battlegrounds.\n\nPresident Donald Trump rushed around the country on Monday in a final bid to drive his voters to the polls and blunt any late Democratic momentum in the battle for control of the Senate.\n\nThe president kicked off the final day of the campaign with a rally in Cleveland, where he told supporters midterm elections were \u201cboring\u201d before he took office. Imploring them to vote as if he were on the ballot Tuesday, he echoed the messages he's been delivering down the homestretch: that putting Democrats in charge of Congress would put the robust economy in jeopardy and risk opening the borders to undocumented immigrants.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump conclude his campaign sprint with back-to-back rallies in Missouri and Indiana, two states he won overwhelmingly in 2016 that are critical to Republican hopes to maintain or grow their Senate majority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all fragile. We have to go out and we have to vote,\u201d Trump said on a conference call with supporters Monday ahead of his three-rally day. \u201cEven though I\u2019m not on a ballot, in a certain way I\u2019m on the ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have an energy over the last couple weeks that people have not seen in the Republican Party and it feels very much like \u201816 because they love what we\u2019ve done and they want to keep it going,\u201d he added.\n\nBut appearing in Cape Girardeau, Mo., on Monday night to make his very last pitch to voters ahead of Election Day, the president took nearly 30 minutes before first mentioning Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley. He instead focused on his own political ascent in 2016 and his various successes in office.\n\nHawley is challenging incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill, one of the several endangered red-state Democrats the president has prioritized toppling over the past week.\n\nAs Trump barnstormed the country to turn out his supporters, a final batch of polls provided signs of late momentum for Democrats in the battle for the Senate, with surveys showing their candidates leading in two battleground races and significantly ahead in New Jersey.\n\nIn Florida, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson led Republican Gov. Rick Scott in two surveys out Monday, a sign that the critical battleground race is breaking their way in the final days. And in Missouri, an NBC News poll showed Democratic McCaskill slightly ahead of Hawley despite Republican optimism in recent weeks that the race had shifted in their favor.\n\nDemocrats would need both those polls to be correct \u2014 especially in Missouri, where Hawley led by a similar margin in several other recent public polls \u2014 and to have similar momentum in a handful of other tossup races, to have any shot at winning the Senate majority Tuesday night.\n\nIt's a long shot, but not impossible.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201810/2743/1155968404_5853686259001_5853685201001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nGiven the GOP\u2019s dim odds of keeping the House majority, the president has bet on his ability to gin up last-minute enthusiasm among his voters in red states to protect or even grow his party\u2018s Senate majority. Trump\u2019s Indiana and Missouri rallies will be his second visit to each state in recent days. He also held rallies in Montana, Tennessee and Florida over the weekend to give a last-minute boost to Republican Senate candidates.\n\nThe president\u2019s closing schedule underlines the uncertainty of the Senate map, with a handful of tossup races in which neither party has a clear advantage. Republicans are confident they can flip North Dakota and protect Tennessee, and Democrats are bullish on holding West Virginia and flipping Nevada. But at least five races \u2014 in Arizona, Florida, Montana, Indiana and Missouri \u2014 remain tight.\n\nTrump\u2019s ability to mobilize his voters in these states could determine whether Republicans are able to protect or make slight gains on their 51-49 Senate majority.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to do well in the House,\u201d Trump said Sunday. \u201cBut, as you know, my primary focus has been on the Senate, and I think we\u2019re doing really well in the Senate.\u201d\n\nFlorida governor and Senate candidate Rick Scott speaks alongside President Donald Trump at a campaign rally at the Pensacola International Airport on Saturday. | Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images\n\nBut Democrats have not given up hope of winning the chamber. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Sunday that Democrats have a \u201cnarrow\u201d path to capturing the chamber. He also pointed how the terrain has shifted in Democrats' favor over the course of the election cycle, despite a map that tilts heavily towards Republicans. Democrats remain clear favorites in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all states Trump won two years ago.\n\n\u201cI don't want to define a good night, because what we see right now is a situation that is a whole lot better than anyone would have predicted 18 months ago, when Republicans were saying that they might win another eight seats and have a filibuster-proof majority in the United States Senate,\u201d Van Hollen said Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201c \u201cNo one's talking about that right now.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) rallied for Republican Matt Rosendale in Montana, linking Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Testerto Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and former President Obama. Pence called a vote for Tester a \"vote for the liberal agenda, a vote for more resistance.\"\n\nGraham, who has visited nearly every battleground Senate race in recent weeks to energize conservative voters around the Supreme Court, pitched the election as a referendum on Tester's opposition to the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\n\"You want justice for Brett Kavanaugh, Jon Tester needs to lose,\" Graham said.\n\nIn Florida, a Quinnipiac University poll out Monday showed Nelson ahead of Gov. Rick Scott by 7 percentage points; an NBC News poll showed Nelson with a narrower, 4-point edge over the Republican governor.\n\nScott rejected both surveys, saying Monday morning that he believes the momentum is on his side.\n\n\"We have big rallies, lots of energy on our side, so we're going to have a big win,\u201d Scott said on Fox News. \u201cThere\u2019s no blue wave. If anything there's a red wave.\"\n\nIn Missouri, McCaskill led Hawley by 3 points in an NBC poll, 47 to 44 percent, with several other candidates receiving nominal support. Hawley led McCaskill by a similar margin in two other surveys released Monday. Missouri has no early voting and both parties are working feverishly to boost turnout on Election Day. Trump\u2019s rally there Monday night in the most conservative corner of the state is scheduled just nine hours before polls open.\n\nDemocrats also look poised to avoid a debacle in New Jersey, where Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez led Republican Bob Hugin by 15 points in a final Quinnipiac University poll. Democrats invested millions down the stretch to boost Menendez's flagging campaign.\n\nNationally, polls diverged over whether the environment had shifted for Democrats or Republicans in the final days of the campaign. A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll Monday showed Democrats with only a slight lead in the generic ballot, 43 to 40 percent.

If that happens, it could translate into $3.4 billion in higher premiums for personal auto insurance, as well as significant increases for commercial auto insurance, PCI and two other insurance associations wrote in a letter to Trump this summer.\n\nOther hits to consumer pocketbooks: Trump has already imposed a 25 percent on some Chinese-made auto parts, including catalytic converters, compressors, bearings and speed sensors.\n\nHe\u2019s also imposed a 10 percent duty that will rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1 on an even longer list. That includes products needed for car repairs after accidents such as vehicle sensors; brake pads, drums, rotors and hoses; automotive tires; bearings; mufflers; drive axles; suspension parts; gaskets; safety glass; and accessories such as floor mats, wipers and mirrors.

So we think they should go back to the drawing board.\u201d\n\nUSTR spokesman Jeffrey Emerson defended the USMCA. \u201cIt actually raises the environmental standards beyond what they are in NAFTA or the TPP, with strengthened obligations in many areas such as wildlife trafficking and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, as well as first-ever obligations to address pressing environmental issues such as marine litter and air quality,\u201d Emerson said.

Mahoney said in a statement announcing the action.\n\nA positive signal for international labor issues?: The action could give Democrats more confidence that Trump will aggressively enforce labor provisions of trade agreements as the administration pushes for approval next year of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.\n\nStill, Mauritania has one of the smallest economies in Africa and does little trade with the United States. Last year, Mauritania exported only about $62 million worth of goods here and imported about $128 million of U.S. goods.\n\nTHE BRITISH ARE HERE!

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to identify the eight countries during a phone call with reporters on Friday, but he said the EU was not on the list. Stay tuned for further details.\n\nAFTER MIDTERMS, CONGRESSIONAL STAFF MUSICAL CHAIRS: Trade watchers may want to know who will be handling policy issues if the House flips to Democratic control. For the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees, a staff shakeup could occur but it\u2019s more likely that the same officials will maintain their positions albeit in new roles depending on the outcome of the election:\n\n\u2014 If the House flips to Democrats, Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.) will take the gavel of Ways and Means, the all-powerful tax-writing committee that has jurisdiction over trade issues. That could put Katherine Tai in the position of chief trade counsel for the majority. She has served as Democratic chief counsel since January 2017. She joined the committee in 2014 after eight years at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\n\u2014 Whether they are in the majority or minority, Ways and Means Republicans will likely continue to rely on the expertise of Angela Ellard, who has served as Republican chief trade counsel/staff director since 1998 and has been a fixture on the committee since 1995.\n\n\u2014 For the Senate Finance Committee, it\u2019s unlikely that Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) will take the gavel. Regardless, Jayme White, chief adviser on international competitiveness and innovation, is expected continue his role as the top trade staffer for Democrats on the panel. White has been a Finance staffer since 2009.\n\n\u2014 For Republicans in Senate Finance, there will be a new leader with the retirement of Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). It\u2019s unclear yet who will be the GOP\u2019s top trade staffer on the panel, but Shane Warren has been serving as Republican chief trade counsel since June 2017. Warren, also an alumnus of USTR\u2019s legal division, has been on Finance Committee staff since 2013.\n\nEU AGRICULTURE MEASURES GET SLAMMED AT WTO: The European Union was taken to task over two new measures it has taken. One involves setting new maximum residue levels for certain pesticides. In another case, it was criticized for adopting a European Court of Justice ruling that allows plants cultivated by a scientific process known as mutagenesis to fall under EU laws restricting GMOs.\n\nThe pesticides issue: Several member nations, including the U.S., said the EU\u2019s pesticides policies were not based on scientific evidence. The complaints were made during a Nov. 1-2 meeting of the World Trade Organization\u2019s Sanitary and Phytosanitary Committee.

Key committees in both chambers are very likely to have new leaders come January. Get acquainted with help from our Tanya Snyder and Brianna Gurciullo.\n\nIn the House: Oregon Democrat Peter DeFazio, who\u2019s been leading the minority on the Transportation Committee since 2014, is poised to take the gavel if his party manages to flip the chamber. DeFazio has a long resume and a deep understanding of transportation issues, Tanya reports. But he\u2019s also a bomb-thrower, and could subject DOT to a level of oversight the agency hasn\u2019t experienced in years, with safety and the grant process as particular areas of interest. Look out for the funding fight over the Gateway project to evolve from a \u201cmicro-level\u201d squabble to a \u201cmacro-level\u201d battle, one lobbyist said.\n\nIn the Senate: There are plenty of ways things could play out, but the most likely scenario is that Republicans hold on to their majority, and Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) is elected to the No. 2 position in Republican leadership, leaving his gavel for the taking. The next in line on Commerce is Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), an Amtrak-booster who observers say is mostly cut from similar cloth as Thune, Brianna reported Friday. One area to watch: the skies. Wicker is a general aviation supporter and hasn\u2019t always aligned with airlines, including on FAA reauthorization language that was the subject of debate.

Steve Dickson, previously senior vice president of global flight operations at Delta Air Lines, looks to be the front-runner to get the nod for FAA administrator \u2014 but no decision has been finalized yet, The Wall Street Journal reported. Dickson \u201chas garnered White House support, broad industry backing and a generally positive response among Senate Republicans,\u201d Andy Pasztor and Alison Sider wrote. They also reported that Dan Elwell, the agency\u2019s acting administrator, has withdrawn his bid for the job \u201cbecause there was no consensus for his candidacy.\u201d President Donald Trump has favored his personal pilot, John Dunkin, to lead the agency, but the idea has been met with skepticism from industry and Congress.\n\nPros and cons: Trump has said that he believes the agency's administrator should be a pilot. In addition to being a pilot for Delta, Dickson was a fighter pilot in the Air Force. But Dickson, while he was at Delta, argued against severing air traffic control operations from the FAA \u2014 a move Trump supports. In a 2016 interview with POLITICO, Dickson said Delta believed \u201cthe airspace and air traffic control needs to be modernized,\u201d but \u201cthe best path to move forward is to continue to collaborate with the FAA under the existing structure \u2014 keep the FAA together as an entity.\u201d (Delta later changed its position.)\n\nVacancy watch: It\u2019s been 10 months since Michael Huerta left the FAA after a five-year term as administrator. And it\u2019s been a busy time for Elwell as the agency has waded into implementing a long-term FAA reauthorization.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nCULTURE WARS: The fight over infrastructure funding is a prime example of the transformation of nonpartisan issues into \u201cmad-as-hell battles of the bases,\u201d writes Michael Grunwald for POLITICO Magazine. Infrastructure spending used to be reasonably uncontroversial. But today, \u201cmany conservatives portray it as a liberal plot to siphon rural tax dollars into urban bike paths, subways, and high-speed rail boondoggles that unions will build and Democratic city slickers will use,\u201d Grunwald writes. \u201cThe Trump administration actually changed the rules of the most prominent grant program for local transportation projects so that it explicitly favors rural projects, infuriating liberals who now see it as a slush fund for sprawl roads to nowhere serving out-in-the-boonies Trump voters.\u201d\n\n** A message from the Association of American Railroads: What could you do if you had x-ray vision?

IRS employees have begun voicing concerns through their union that the agency is ill prepared, given the lack of training they\u2019ve had to date on tax law changes that took effect this year that are certain to prompt a host of taxpayer inquiries, as yours truly reports. \u201cMany are saying that training on the new tax law is completely inadequate,\u201d National Treasury Employees Union National President Tony Reardon told me. Preparing employees for taxpayer assistance duties should be happening now for the filing season to begin in January as usual, he said, blaming the current problem in large part on lack of sufficient funding from Congress.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nReardon\u2019s worry echoes an earlier warning that the filing season could face delays for another reason: IRS information technology systems might not be ready to start on time because the agency\u2019s IT group hasn\u2019t received all the material it needs to make system changes, according to examination results released in September by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. IRS business units typically supply that information by Jan. 31 in a given year for the next year\u2019s filing season, but because the new law was signed at the end of last year, the IT organization set out several later deadlines well beyond Jan. 31 to allow for timely implementation of new law\u2019s tax provisions, which TIGTA found haven\u2019t been met.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that it is going to take a major effort to make sure the IRS\u2019s current information systems can handle the job,\u201d said Floyd Williams, who for 16 years was the IRS director of legislative affairs. Yet because the administration so glowingly touts the new law, H.R. 1, a round-the-clock effort is likely to get under way to ensure filing season starts on time, Williams told Morning Tax.\n\nThe IRS has answers. A statement responding to the union concerns said the IRS \u201chas been extremely focused on building the necessary infrastructure and training materials for our employees. Critical training has already been conducted and more is scheduled before filing season starts.\u201d In addition, the agency is \u201cwell on our way\u201d to creating or revising hundreds of forms, instructions and publications to implement tax reform provisions, the statement said. \u201cWe have not yet announced the official start date of filing season, which we typically do later in the year, but we will be ready to help taxpayers understand changes affecting the upcoming tax season,\u201d the statement said.\n\nDelayed filing seasons aren\u2019t unprecedented \u2014 Williams recounted a handful of times that it started late by a week or more during his time at the agency. Late-year bills are often to blame \u2014 think extenders. \u201cThe IRS has been through this drill many, many times with Congress passing last minute legislation,\u201d said Karen Hawkins, immediate past chair of the American Bar Association\u2019s tax section. It\u2019s rare when no problems crop up during the year, according to Williams.\n\nSo what does it all mean? Well, taxpayers shouldn\u2019t expect the IRS to delay the usual due date on or about April 15 for filing tax returns (April 15 falling on a Sunday or holiday can affect the deadline). They can file for an extension if needed. Besides, moving that deadline would be extraordinary, said Williams, who\u2019s now at Public Strategies Washington Inc. Doing so would invite the wrath of Republicans in Congress, which new IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig would surely want to avoid, Hawkins told Morning Tax. She\u2019s not surprised \u201cthe very change-resistant IRS employees\u201d have anxiety about being unprepared for filing season, but Williams predicted the IRS would muddle through filing season and declare success.\n\nWELCOME TO THE MONDAY GRIND at Morning Tax, where we\u2019d love to hear how you\u2019re adjusting to the end of daylight saving time.\n\nEmail: bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, alorenzo@politico.com.\n\nTwitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brianfaler, @aaronelorenzo,@POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nPOLITICO Pro announces dedicated California coverage: On Nov. 7, there will be a new authority on California politics and policy.

The updated arrangement also makes it clearer to users that they have multiple Free File options, even if they\u2019re rejected by one of the dozen companies included in the partnership. \u201cTo ensure the longevity of this important program, we have called for commonsense updates and improvements,\u201d an H&R Block statement said. Detractors have decried H&R Block and Intuit, which sells Turbo Tax, for blocking the IRS from offering easier pathways for taxpayers to file. The program has faced criticism from some experts who said Free File was difficult to navigate and sometimes directed users toward products that cost them money instead.\n\nMEET THE DEM STAFFERS: Should Democrats take control of the House next year, it might be time to dust off the Rolodexes \u2014 does anyone still use those? \u2014 and add some names if they\u2019re not already there.

But more seriously, Brady also praised Weidinger\u2019s valuable counsel and thanked his wife and eight children.\n\nIN FAVOR OF OPPORTUNITY ZONES: The new Opportunity Zone tax incentive program is more popular than not, according to the newest Prudential Insurance American Workers Survey.

The American Diabetes Association estimates the total cost of diagnosed diabetes, including lost productivity, reached $327 billion in 2017, a big jump from $245 billion just five years earlier. And more and more young people are affected.\n\nPOLITICO convened a working group of clinicians, policymakers, researchers and community-based health workers to discuss the opportunities for prevention and management of this chronic disease. Participants agreed that the challenge is finding ways of preventing diabetes when possible and managing it optimally when prevention fails-- and care has to take place in the community as well as the clinic. But the rewards for better prevention and management are great - because if the health system can address the risk factors for diabetes, including weight, it will also be addressing many aspects of population health overall.

Locals in Nevada, Iowa, and Tennessee posted similar numbers. SEIU members in Texas weren\u2019t far behind at 21 percent, potentially helping Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Tex.)\u2019s challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Perhaps the most significant metric, though, is this: Of the SEIU members who have voted already, 31 percent didn\u2019t vote in 2014. Many are progressives who turn out only infrequently, according to the union, signaling energy in the Democratic base.\n\nIn Nevada, UNITE HERE is marshaling troops for Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who is narrowly trailing Sen.Dean Heller (R-Nev.). The Culinary Union has registered more than 10,000 members and their families since 2016, according to internal figures. In some cases the union has given hospitality workers long leaves of absence to canvas; one worker featured in a New York Times editorial over the weekend has been campaigning six days a week since May.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, UNITE HERE has been rallying members at their workplaces \u2014 a strategy that proved effective in Missouri this year when unions overturned the state\u2019s right-to-work law. The American Federation of Teachers has national staff on the ground, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports, and CWA has been running activist boot camps in the Keystone State.

The proposals would end right-to-work, overturn key Supreme Court decisions, strengthen the NLRB and unions\u2019 power in the workplace, among other things; none of them, however, is likely to go further than the House if the Senate remains Republican, as forecast. More here.\n\nBOOMING ECONOMY UNDER GOP OBSCURED BY TRUMP: The GOP couldn\u2019t have asked for a better jobs report Friday, with wages in October rising 3.1 percent over the previous year and the economy adding 250,000 new jobs.\n\nAnd yet, the booming economy has not been an especially prominent theme of President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric. \u201cInstead,\u201d Ian Kullgren writes, \u201cTrump has focused on a caravan of Central American migrants heading north to the U.S. border; on a constitutionally dubious threat to revoke birthright citizenship; on fomenting trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China; and on a long-running battle with the Federal Reserve over raising interest rates.\u201d More here.\n\nRelated read: \u201cFed Will Likely Raise Rates After Strong Jobs Report,\u201d from the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLEVIN\u2019S SON COULD BECOME NEW VOICE ON LABOR: Andy Levin, the son of retiring Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.), is poised to become a new labor advocate in Congress. In August the younger Levin won the primary in his father\u2019s Democratic district with 52 percent of the vote. Beyond his last name, Andy Levin a former union organizer and an attorney who sat on former President Bill Clinton\u2019s labor law reform commission. Levin also worked at the AFL-CIO, where he pressed Congress to pass the Employee Free Choice Act (\u201ccard check\u201d). That bill failed in the Senate by a narrow margin in 2007. Read an interview he gave Friday to the Macomb Daily here.\n\nINSIDE DOL\n\nNEW DRUG TESTING RULE: The Labor Department this morning will publish in the Federal Register a proposed regulation that would allow states to subject to drug testing a broad swath of applicants for unemployment insurance.\n\nUnder the 2012 Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, Congress gave states the authority to drug test an applicant for unemployment benefits under limited circumstances \u2014 a Democratic concession to Republicans to in exchange for emergency spending on unemployment insurance. President Barack Obama\u2019s Labor Department issued in 2016 a regulation that subjected relatively few categories of applicants to the drug tests. That didn\u2019t sit well with Republicans, who after Trump took office repealed the rule under the Congressional Review Act.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: Under the CRA, after a regulation is revoked federal agencies are barred from subsequently issuing a rule that is \u201csubstantially the same\u201d \u2014 meaning DOL\u2019s new version of the drug-test rule may be vulnerable to a court challenge. DOL says its new rule is \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from the previous rule, but some regulatory experts aren\u2019t buying it. More here.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\nPENTAGON REJECTED TROOP REQUEST AT FIRST: The Pentagon initially rejected the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s request to send troops to the border, CNN reports.\n\n\u201cAccording to two defense official[s] familiar with the request, the Department of Homeland Security asked that the Pentagon provide a reserve force that could be called upon to provide \u2018crowd and traffic control\u2019 and safeguard Customs and Border Protection personnel at the border to counter a group of Central American migrants walking to the US border to request asylum,\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Browne and Nicole Gaouette report.\n\n\u201cThe Pentagon rejected the request on October 26, according to one of the officials, even as it signed off on providing DHS with air and logistics support, medical personnel and engineers. The request was turned down because the Department of Defense felt that active duty troops do not have the authority to conduct that type of mission unless they are granted additional authorities by the President.\u201d More here.\n\nRelated read: \u201cHomeland security chief defends Trump's plan to send troops to border,\u201d from the Guardian.\n\nTEXAS FIRM WINS BORDER WALL CONTRACT: \u201cA Texas company has been granted a $145 million federal contract to build six miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley,\u201d the Associated Press reports. \u201cGalveston-based SLSCO will start construction of an 18-foot, reinforced concrete levee wall in February, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said.\n\n\u201cThe project, which will take place in the agency's McAllen Station region, will also raise the height of existing fences. The wall will be the first section of President Donald Trump's border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley, which is the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.\u201d More here.\n\nTHE BENEFITS OF A CARAVAN: Caravans like the one President Donald Trump has lambasted are becoming a more frequent way for migrants to travel north \u2014 perhaps with good reason, Anna-Catherine Brigida writes for the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cCaravans were once used sparingly to spotlight a particular problem,\u201d Brigida writes. \u201cA group of Central American mothers, for example, has traveled through Mexico each year for 14 years searching for sons and daughters who disappeared on the migrant trail. The Mesoamerican Caravan for a Good Life has organized migrant caravans for years, including one in March that gained international attention.\n\n\u201cBut experts now predict that caravan-style treks could become a more frequent scene along the decades-old migration routes from the region. President Trump has reacted with combative and unsubstantiated claims that the migrants \u2014 including many families and children \u2014 pose a threat that requires military mobilization at the southern border.\n\n\u201cStill, the national attention has also brought awareness of the potential benefits of the caravans for migrants, such as increased safety along the route and shared resources. This could bring even more such groups in the future, migrant activists say.\u201d More here.\n\nRelated read: \u201cU.S. militia groups head to border, stirred by Trump\u2019s call to arms,\u201d from the Washington Post.\n\nUNIONS\n\nUSW REACHES AGREEMENT WITH ARCELORMITTAL: \u201cThe United Steelworkers union and ArcelorMittal reached a tentative deal on a new labor contract covering about 15,000 workers after several months of negotiations,\u201d the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Patrick Thomas reports.\n\n\u201cThe four-year agreement for workers includes wage increases between 3% and 4% each year and a $4,000 ratification bonus. The deal with ArcelorMittal, the world\u2019s largest steelmaker, comes less than a month after the union reached a similar agreement with workers from U.S. Steel Corp.\n\n\u201cWorkers at the two largest U.S. steelmakers have been demanding higher compensation as tariffs on foreign metal push prices and profits to their highest point in years.

While education may not be a top issue driving people to the polls (according to one POLITICO/Morning Consult poll) and may have been far overshadowed by health care on the campaign trail, it has been a talker in many state and federal races.\n\n\u2014 Teacher strikes, teacher pay, teachers running for office, public education funding, debt-free college and school safety have all played out in congressional, gubernatorial and down-ballot races this cycle. So Morning Education reached out to a variety of education wonks to see what they\u2019re watching on Election Day and in the weeks to come.\n\n\u2014 A lot of the interesting stuff is in the states. Education wonks are monitoring the outcomes of gubernatorial and state legislative races for actual consequences when it comes to schools and education policy. POLITICO\u2019s Morning Score reports that, when it comes to statehouses, Democrats are hoping to flip \u201c6-8 chambers \u2026 and around 300-350 state legislative seats from red to blue,\u201d said Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee Executive Director Jessica Post. \u201cWe know it\u2019ll be an uphill battle,\u201d she continued, saying maps have been drawn to favor Republicans. \u201cBut we feel great about our chances.\u201d\n\n\u2014 If a blue wave materializes, expect school funding to keep coming up. \u201cSo many governorships and state legislatures are currently controlled by the GOP that if there were a wave, we could see a dramatic shift in what policy reforms are prioritized in the states,\u201d said Andy Smarick, director of civil society, education and work at the R Street Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cWe might expect a couple years\u2019 worth of fights over teacher pay increases and changes to state funding formulas for K-12 education.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Again, watch for school funding reform: \u201cIf there's a blue wave and we see Democratic governors and Democratic legislatures in more places, expect policymakers to open the public's checkbook for increases in school spending,\u201d said Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education think tank. \u201cGiven that the economy is red-hot and state finances are in better shape than they have been for a decade \u2014 a situation that is unlikely to last \u2014 now is the time to get funding increases, and funding reform, done.\u201d\n\n\u2014 School choice advocates are counting on Republicans in down-ballot races. \u201cState elections always have the potential to shuffle the deck in state capitals, which could have major implications for private school choice programs and charter schools in 2019,\u201d said John Schilling, president of the American Federation for Children, the school choice advocacy group formerly chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\n\u2014\u201cThere are historic numbers of open state legislative seats across our target states, and based on our polling and grassroots efforts, we see a lot of momentum to create and expand educational options among candidates and certainly among voters when the legislative sessions convene in January.\u201d\n\nGOOD MONDAY MORNING, NOV. 5.

State races could also have a major impact on the plans that states developed for holding schools accountable under the Every Student Succeeds Act, said Phillip Lovell, vice president of policy development and government relations for the Alliance for Excellent Education, an education advocacy group closely tracking those plans. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has approved every single one of them, but new leadership could open them up to changes.\n\n\u2014 New Mexico\u2019s ESSA plan could see the biggest changes. Polls earlier this year showed the governor\u2019s race was a dead heat, and a recent poll shows Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham pulling away from her opponent Republican Rep. Steve Pearce. But the state\u2019s ESSA plan could change no matter who wins.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Democratic legislature is salivating at the prospect of making major changes to New Mexico\u2019s accountability system under a new governor, despite the gains made by the state in recent years and the commitment to equity clearly articulated in the current plan,\u201d Lovell said. Teacher evaluations tied to student test scores have been especially controversial in New Mexico, with teachers burning their evaluations in protest in recent years. Both gubernatorial candidates have shown an interest in scrapping the Common Core-aligned PARCC test and overhauling the state\u2019s teacher evaluation system.\n\nWHAT FEDERAL RACES WILL MEAN FOR DEVOS AND LEGISLATION: Education wonks, like everyone else, will be keeping an eye on changes in the political makeup and leadership of the House and Senate.\n\n\u2014\u201cSome of our biggest progress in federal education policy came when congressional leadership was split, one chamber R, one chamber D, and I see a good chance at some progress on bills like [the Higher Education Act] and [the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act] under this scenario,\u201d said Noelle Ellerson, associate executive director of policy and advocacy for AASA: The School Superintendents Association, which represents school district superintendents nationwide.\n\n\u2014 DeVos under the microscope: \u201cA blue wave election, with Democrats taking control of the House, won't stop the Trump administration from pursuing its preferred policies \u2014 whether deregulation of higher education, drastic cuts to education funding, or reorganization of key offices \u2014 but it could increase the political costs of doing so,\u201d said Anne Hyslop, a former Obama education official now with the Alliance for Excellent Education.\n\n\u2014 \u201cOnce in the majority, Democrats can hold public oversight hearings with Education Department officials, subpoena documents, call for monitoring reports and audits, and more \u2014 a level of pressure Secretary DeVos really hasn\u2019t faced since her nomination. Of course, divided government will also dramatically change the dynamics for major legislative efforts, like HEA reauthorization, giving Democrats more leverage to insert their priorities into any overhaul.\u201d\n\nWHAT THE MIDTERMS COULD MEAN FOR APPROPRIATIONS: Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) is expected to become chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee if her party wins the House majority. Such a victory would put Democrats in a position to fend off the last bout of sequestration, try their luck at restoring earmarks and use the power of the purse to hold the Trump administration \u201caccountable,\u201d Lowey told Pro budget reporter Jennifer Scholtes.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWith Republicans in charge, we have frankly leapt from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis,\u201d Lowey said. \u201cAnd many of the shutdowns and the continuing resolution are the direct result of the Budget Control Act of 2011, S. 365 (112), which left us with unworkable caps on defense and non-defense spending.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cEven with two-year budget deals that sought to dampen the effect of the 2011 law, non-defense spending remains below 2010 levels,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you adjust for inflation, in my judgment \u2014 and I think for most Democrats \u2014 we still aren\u2019t serving enough children in after-school programs, Head Start. Roads, bridges, tunnels are in terrible shape. And we want to make sure that we deal with that.\u201d More.\n\nTEACHERS UNIONS MAKE LAST PUSH: The leaders of the nation\u2019s two largest teachers unions made their final GOTV pushes this weekend. Both unions campaigned for Democrat Andrew Gillum, who\u2019s locked in a close race against Republican Ron DeSantis for Florida governor, and Gretchen Whitmer, who has maintained a lead over Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette in the Michigan governor\u2019s race.\n\n\u2014 National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda went to Las Vegas, Phoenix and Miami this weekend, backing teachers running for office and, in Florida, Gillum. NEA Vice President Becky Pringle campaigned in Michigan for Whitmer.\n\n\u2014 American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten spent Friday in Connecticut for Democrat Ned Lamont, who\u2019s in a close race against Republican Bob Stefanowski for governor. She spent the weekend in Florida for Gillum and she\u2019s headed to Michigan today for Whitmer.\n\n\u2014 Their civic duty: Eskelsen Garc\u00eda will spend Election Day in D.C., where she plans to vote, and Weingarten is headed back to New York to cast her ballot.\n\nIRS TO HEAR FROM EDUCATION ADVOCATES: In non-midterm news, the IRS today will hold a public hearing on a proposed rule that seeks to limit the federal deductibility of contributions to charitable organizations. The Treasury Department published the rule in August and the agency received more than 7,000 comments \u2014 many from school choice backers who oppose the rule and voucher opponents who support it.\n\n\u2014 Some context: Eighteen states have tax credit scholarship programs that award individuals or businesses a full or partial tax credit when they donate to organizations that grant private school scholarships. About a dozen of them issue full tax credits to donors and combined with the federal deduction, the tax benefits can exceed the size of the donation.\n\n\u2014 The proposed rule, aimed at preventing efforts by some blue states to get around a new limit on state and local tax deductions, would prevent donors who contribute to state tax credit scholarship programs from reaping such a benefit. School choice advocates worry the rule will make taxpayers less likely to donate to organizations that award private school scholarships because of the reduced tax benefit, ultimately hurting students, many of whom come from low-income families.\n\n\u2014 Twenty-five people are scheduled to testify at today\u2019s hearing and it looks like school choice could dominate the discussion. Among them are a student, parent and graduate of the Alabama Opportunity Scholarship Fund, which provides tax credited private school scholarships to students in the state. Executive Director Lesley Searcy, who\u2019s attending the hearing, said she hopes they\u2019ll \u201cput a human face on this issue.\u201d Leslie Hiner, vice president of legal affairs for the Indianapolis-based advocacy group EdChoice, is also scheduled to testify.\n\n\u2014 On the flip side, Sasha Pudelski, advocacy director for AASA, The School Superintendents Association, will thank the IRS for shutting down \u201ca tax shelter for educational scholarship programs.\u201d Marc Egan, the National Education Association\u2019s director of government affairs, is also scheduled to testify. Check out the list of speakers.\n\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS\n\n\u2014 Former North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue has been appointed to serve as chairwoman of the National Assessment Governing Board, DeVos announced on Friday. Perdue will be the first female chair in the 30-year history of the board, which sets policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or the Nation\u2019s Report Card.\n\n\u2014 F. Javier Cevallos, president of Framingham State University in Massachusetts, has assumed the chair of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities\u2019 board of directors.\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n\u2014 The National Association for College Admission Counseling has released a new research brief that finds the intensity of the political climate has led to an increase in activism at 52 percent of all secondary schools.\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n\u2014 DeVos family pumps big bucks into GOP campaigns as Dems bemoan influence: The Detroit News.\n\n\u2014 Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Neil Gorsuch on promoting education in citizenship: CBS.\n\n\u2014 California gubernatorial candidate Gavin Newsom pushes big-budget early childhood education agenda in closing days of campaign: Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u2014 In New York City schools, 40,000 students aren\u2019t getting required special education services, report finds: Chalkbeat.\n\n\u2014 Florida Gov.

The National Association of Secretaries of State late last week touted the state-federal relationship, something few would\u2019ve done in 2016. And DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen boasted that the midterms would be the the most secure ever.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that this White House, though, has frankly held back,\u201d Warner said, pointing to White House resistance to the most prominent election security bill in Congress (S. 2593). Few states have implemented post-election risk-limiting audits to safeguard against tampering, and some still use particularly vulnerable paperless voting machines. Texas and Georgia already have seen voting glitches on such machines, as POLITICO\u2019s Christian Vasquez and Matthew Choi reported Sunday. At least two other states had been using file-sharing software on state election servers that made them vulnerable in other ways, Pro Publica reported late last week. Vendor and candidate cybersecurity remain among the least addressed areas.\n\nThe White House likewise has no strategy for combating election influence operations, as Eric reported. Social media giants are still wrestling to control such meddling attempts, with Twitter deleting 10,000 accounts over the past two months that mostly posed as Democrats and discouraged voters from heading to the polls, Reuters reported late last week.\n\n\u2014 The known threat: We know there was a successful cyberattack against Knox County, Tenn., during the primaries. Likewise, DHS circulated a report on seeing a \u201cgrowing\u201d number of attempted attacks on state and local election system during the midterms, which the department said was a product of improved information sharing rather than evidence of an uptick. The Boston Globe today reported in greater detail on DHS memos to election officials and law enforcement.\n\nOn the candidate side, hackers caused trouble for three California Democratic House candidates during the primaries. Sen. Claire McCaskill, one of the nation\u2019s more vulnerable Democrats, said hackers went after her office network, as did Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, although Google alerts about attempted attacks to senatorial offices of both parties make it hard to draw conclusions about whether the hackers were trying to meddle in the election or conduct more routine cyber espionage. Another vulnerable Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin, last week said his social media accounts were hacked, but he offered few details.\n\nRussia, Iran and China are all trying to influence the midterms, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement leaders declared last month. New charges unsealed against a Russian woman last month provided details about the scope of Russia\u2019s alleged interference operation in this election cycle. Facebook late last month removed 82 pages tied to Iran over \u201cinauthentic activity\u201d designed to sow discord ahead of the elections. There\u2019s widespread skepticism about the administration\u2019s claims about Chinese interference, however.\n\n\u2014 The unknown threat: Despite plenty to worry about, the 2018 interference we\u2019ve seen so far pales in comparison to the 2016 meddling, prompting some degree of bafflement and speculation. Perhaps Russia is waiting until the last minute, some say. Perhaps their hackers have been more discreet this time around. Perhaps they\u2019re gearing up for the juicier 2020 presidential race. One of the main Russian hacking groups accused of nefarious activity during the 2016 campaign might have resumed an emphasis on cyber espionage rather than disruption, if their detected activity elsewhere in the world offers hints.\n\nHAPPY MONDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

Kemp happens to be running on the GOP ticket for governor at the same time he\u2019s holding the secretary job. Naturally, Democrats called it a political stunt, and pointed to Kemp\u2019s history of cyber missteps in the office, and things only got more contentious as the day went on. Cybersecurity experts and researchers took offense, especially given the status of Kemp\u2019s website security in a state often criticized by election integrity groups as among the worst in the nation.\n\nThe announcement of the investigation came shortly after attorneys suing Kemp on behalf of Georgia voters notified his office of a voter registration system vulnerability that they say could render millions unable to vote, one of the lawyers, David Cross, said. \"Everyone's focused on the wrong thing and doing exactly what Kemp wants,\" Cross told POLITICO. \"He was worried the vulnerability was going to come to light and he wanted to get ahead of it and have the story focused on something else.\"\n\nCross said a Georgia voter noticed the state's My Voter page didn't require verification of his identity while he was seeking his own voter registration information, and that anyone could access voters' personal data through the vulnerability, and alter it. The resident sought out one of Cross's clients, and the attorneys spoke to the voter Friday afternoon. The attorneys then notified the FBI and Kemp's outside counsel on Saturday, Cross said, and gave them the voter's information.Meanwhile, the resident also contacted the Democratic party as another avenue of addressing it, Cross said.\n\nThe vulnerability remains, Cross said: \"Nothing has been done. Nobody has contacted the Georgia resident. We tried to keep it out of the press because we don't want the vulnerabilities to be known around the world.\"\n\nBut Kemp's office said there was an attempt to breach the My Voter system. \"We opened an investigation into the Democratic Party of Georgia after receiving information from our legal team about failed efforts to breach the online voter registration system and My Voter Page,\" the office said later Sunday. \"We are working with our private sector vendors and investigators to review data logs. We have contacted our federal partners and formally requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate these possible cyber crimes. The Secretary of State's office will release more information as it becomes available.\"\n\nWE RECOMMEND WILLIAM JAMES\u2019 \u2018WILL TO BELIEVE\u2019 \u2014 U.S. IT professionals don\u2019t have much confidence in governments\u2019 ability to securely administer elections, according to a new survey coming out today from ISACA, a group that represents tech pros. Of the nearly 2,000 surveyed, 86 percent said they were concerned about the public sector\u2019s capability to conduct reliable and accurate elections.\n\nREADY FOR THE COUNTER-CYBERATTACK \u2014 The U.S. intelligence community and the DoD have reportedly agreed on a plan to strike at Russia if Moscow attempts to interfere in the midterms. While details are slim, the joint Center for Public Integrity and Daily Beast story published late last week found that American hackers have been given the greenlight to go after Russia\u2019s digital systems if the Kremlin tries to meddle. The plan is in keeping with the Trump administration\u2019s steps to unshackle U.S. military offensive digital operations, starting with the decision to replace an Obama-era directive governing offensive and defensive digital operations with one that gives DoD a freer hand to engage.\n\nBITING ON FAKES \u2014 Presented with screenshots of 11 emails, Americans could only identify fakes correctly about half the time, according to a study by Valimail released late last week. People were less likely to spot fake emails that jived with their political beliefs; for instance, Democrats could spot a fake email from Beto O\u2019Rourke 36 percent of the time, while Republicans could spot a fake email from Ted Cruz 20 percent of the time.\n\n\"The results of this survey confirm what nation-states and bad actors have known for years: that email is incredibly vulnerable to impersonation, and is therefore a prime channel for spreading misinformation, malware, and fraud,\u201d said Alexander Garc\u00eda-Tobar, CEO and co-founder of Valimail. \u201cMore concerning is the fact that consumers\u2019 trust in their public leaders and political candidates can be so easily abused for financial or political gain, when the tools to combat these types of attacks are readily available.\u201d\n\nSTEADY AS SHE GOES \u2014 After a year of changes in the ways that federal agencies assess their cybersecurity posture, the Office of Management and Budget is looking forward to agencies reporting that data in a more stable way over the next few years. The 2018 fiscal year \u201cwas a big change year,\u201d Derek Larson, deputy director for cybersecurity risk and performance management at OMB, told the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board late last week. \u201cFY2019 \u2014 we\u2019re looking for it to be a lot more consistent.\u201d\n\nOMB will continue to tweak agencies\u2019 assessment criteria, known as Federal Information Security Modernization Act, or FISMA, metrics; the office issued new guidance to agencies on Oct. 25. But Larson told the board that recent updates to the metrics \u2014 including a new focus on \u201chigh-value assets\u201d and a shift of assessment responsibility from chief information officers to inspectors general \u2014 had paved the way for a more accurate understanding of where agencies stood. \u201cWe really want to try and be more constant from 2018 to 2019,\u201d he said, \u201cso we can really get that trend data to see how agencies are improving.\u201d\n\nSPY GAMES \u2014 A compromised internet messaging service reportedly allowed China and Iran to roll up dozens of CIA agents. Former officials say in a Yahoo news story from late last week that they believe the breach started with an Iranian double agent who was hired by the clandestine agency. The agent showed Iranian intelligence the website the CIA used for their communications, which Tehran then penetrated through a series of Google searches. The breach also led to China\u2019s penetration of the CIA network in that country, resulting in the death of approximately 30 agency spies.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 *holds breath*\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 An intelligence report concluded that China used Huawei for hacking.

Here\u2019s where the money went:\n\n\u2014 Most contributions went to Republicans, but nearly all the farm bureaus donated to both parties. The majority of donations were relatively small, between $1,000 and $10,000.\n\n\u2014 Texas and California farm bureaus gave about $558,000 and $210,000, respectively, far outpacing other states.\n\nThe top individual recipient among the \u201cBig Four\u201d agriculture committee leaders was Senate Agriculture ranking member Debbie Stabenow, who took in about $18,000 in donations from six of the 10 states POLITICO surveyed.\n\n\u2014 The Michigan Democrat is seeking reelection in a state President Donald Trump won in 2016, though Stabenow is widely favored to prevail. Senate Ag Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) is not up for reelection this year.\n\nOut-of-state spending: Most donations stayed within state boundaries, but ag policymakers and party leaders in competitive races \u2014 like Senate Ag member Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) \u2014 also raked in campaign funds from farm bureaus elsewhere.\n\nLiz has more details here for Pros.\n\nHAPPY MONDAY, NOV. 5!

The California legislature this year approved a controversial ban on new food or beverage taxes through 2031. The surprise move followed a series of recent wins for the pro-tax camp, from San Francisco to Philadelphia. Michigan and Arizona have both passed statewide bans on new food and drink taxes within the last year.\n\nAn expensive fight: In Washington, beverage companies have poured more than $20 million into supporting Initiative 1634, outspending opponents more than 200 to 1. In Oregon, opponents of Measure 103 have raised $7.5 million (some of which will go towards other ballot measures), while supporters raised $5.7 million.\n\nState of play: Polls have been few, but mixed. Measure 103 in Oregon could be close. Opposition to Initiative 1634 was ahead by 20 points, per one poll a few weeks ago.\n\n\u2014 Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg chipped in $2.1 million to oppose the Oregon measure.\n\n\u2014 Washington\u2019s ballot initiative wouldn\u2019t scuttle Seattle\u2019s soda tax, which kicked in earlier this year, but it would stop other localities from following the city\u2019s lead. Read Helena\u2019s full story here.\n\nPERDUE CRITICIZED FOR \u2018COTTON-PICKIN\u2019\u2019 COMMENT: The agriculture secretary and former Georgia governor is facing a backlash after he described the heated Florida gubernatorial race as \u201cso cotton-pickin\u2019 important\u201d at a rally Saturday for GOP candidate Ron DeSantis. The comment, reported by POLITICO Florida\u2019s Matt Dixon, added a new layer of race-related controversy to a campaign where race has been a major factor. It was also a rare case of the normally under-the-radar USDA chief causing national controversy.\n\n\u201cPublic policy matters. Leadership matters. And that is why this election is so cotton-pickin\u2019 important to the state of Florida,\u201d Perdue told supporters in Lakeland, according to a recording provided by the liberal group American Bridge. \u201cI hope you all don\u2019t mess it up.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Democrat Andrew Gillum is running to be Florida\u2019s first black governor. After the August primaries, DeSantis called Gillum \u201carticulate\u201d in a Fox News interview and said Florida voters shouldn\u2019t \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing the Democrat. During an Oct. 21 debate, Gillum accused DeSantis of attempting to \u201cdraw all the attention he can to the color of my skin.\u201d\n\nPerdue\u2019s \u201ccotton-pickin\u2019\u201d comment sparked headlines and online criticism throughout the weekend after it was first reported by POLITICO \u2014 an unusual occurrence for one of Trump\u2019s steadiest Cabinet officials.\n\n\u201cI think there is certainly a throwback element to the language that we\u2019re hearing coming out of the Republican party that is unfortunately disparaging to communities,\u201d Stacey Abrams, who is running for Georgia governor and would be the country\u2019s first black woman governor, said Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cIt may be unintentional, but it signals a deeper misinformation about what Andrew Gillum can accomplish, what I can accomplish.\u201d\n\nA USDA spokesman did not respond, as of MA\u2019s deadline Sunday night, to a request for comment on Perdue\u2019s remark.\n\nUSDA RELOCATIONS GETTING WATCHDOG PROBE: The Agriculture Department\u2019s inspector general will investigate whether USDA followed proper procedures when deciding to move the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture outside of Washington \u2014 and whether the department has the authority to make the moves.\n\nThe IG investigation could potentially trigger stepped-up efforts by lawmakers to block or restrict Perdue\u2019s decision to relocate the agencies in 2019, which has drawn criticism from members of Congress, ag research groups and former USDA staffers.\n\n\u2014 Some appropriators who determine USDA\u2019s budget have appeared skeptical of Perdue\u2019s proposal. They could weigh in on the issue when Congress passes a final Agriculture-FDA spending bill.\n\n\u2014 House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton said Friday that the department\u2019s plans \u201cappear suspicious because of the absence of an adequate explanation\u201d for the move, POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Zimmerman reports. They suggested USDA ignored protocol by \u201comitting required considerations, such as a robust cost-benefit analysis.\u201d\n\n\u2014 USDA has said that moving the agencies outside the Beltway will bring them closer to the farm communities they\u2019re set up to serve, and also help attract new talent that might be turned off by D.C.\u2019s high cost of living.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 Environmentalists ready for NAFTA 2.0 fight: Green groups are gearing up to fight the North American trade pact when lawmakers consider ratification next year. The active opposition could have major consequences for the deal\u2019s fate in Congress \u2014 especially if Democrats win control of the House on Tuesday. Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer has the story.\n\n\u2014 Zinke finds few defenders amid ethics scandals: Industry insiders and Trump allies think Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke might step down amid government watchdog probes into his potentially illegal or unethical actions, Pro Energy\u2019s Zack Colman, Eric Wolff and Ben Lefebvre report.\n\n\u2014 House Democrats\u2019 spending agenda: Rep. Nita Lowey is likely to wield the House Appropriations gavel if Democrats take over the chamber next year. She told Pro Budget\u2019s Jennifer Scholtes she\u2019d rather see Congress close the book on fiscal 2019 during the lame duck, even though a December stopgap could give the party controlling the House more influence over unfinished spending levels next year. Full interview here.\n\n\u2014 Trade turmoil and refinancing troubles: It will be \u201cmore challenging\u201d for farmers to renegotiate current loans or borrow more this winter unless Trump can quickly cut deals to relieve tariff pressure, Kent Thiesse, a vice president and farm loan specialist at MinnStar Bank in Lake Crystal, Minn., told the Star-Tribune.\n\n\u2014 New FDA guidance on added sugars: The agency posted final guidance on added-sugars labeling, including much detail on fruit-juice concentrates \u2014 along with draft guidance on serving sizes. Helena has the story.\n\n\u2014 Combating diabetes: POLITICO convened a working group to explore the growing diabetes crisis that included congressional staff, federal health officials and medical providers.

On Saturday he ventured closer to home, heading to San Diego County to lend his ascendant profile to Ammar Campa-Najjar as the Democrat seeks to unseat Rep. Duncan Hunter in a race increasingly marred by what the Campa-Najjar camp calls racist insinuations . Garcetti said he was seeking to rebut \u201cthe racism and falsehoods.\"\n\n-- Tom Steyer isn\u2019t on the ballot (this time), but the high-rolling Democratic powerbroker has spent millions to juice youth turnout \u2014 some $3.8 million in California alone, which his staff said has led to nearly 30,000 new registrations.

Jeff Denham had almost finished their campaign speeches when Sharon Rubio decided to speak up. \u201cWhat about support for our president?\u201d the 44-year-old accountant shouted. \u201cWhat about a little support for Trump?\u201d\n\n-- Her frustration reflected a recurring dynamic of this congressional race, one of several California contests that have attracted unprecedented amounts of money: the delicate dance with, and around, a polarizing President. Red MAGA hats were sprinkled throughout the audience in a sun-baked shopping center here. But Cox and Denham, dressed in matching outfits of blue checkered shirts tucked into jeans, kept their focus on local issues and largely eschewed mentioning the occupant of the White House.\n\n-- Denham referenced Trump having signed measures intended to increase water deliveries for agriculture -- an existential issue in an agricultural area where the city\u2019s motto starts with the word \u201cWater\u201d and thirsty nut trees are an economic pillar -- but eschewed mentioning \u201cthe president\u201d by name.

The president\u2019s Twitter activity, as well, has skewed more toward statewide races.\n\nOn Monday, the president began his day by tweeting another stream of endorsements for Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley, Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis and Michigan Senate candidate John James following a pair of late night tweets in support of James and California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher.\n\nTrump has already begun to boast that his campaigning has saved the Senate, generally predicted to remain under Republican control, a shift from his past promises that there would be a so-called red wave of GOP enthusiasm in this year\u2019s midterms.\n\nTop Republicans in the House have reportedly implored the president to dial down his bombastic tone, especially on the topic of immigration, and to focus more on the strong state of the economy in an effort to cater to Republican voters in suburban districts.\n\nBut Sanders said Monday that the White House is confident in its closing message of the campaign.\n\n\u201cNobody has worked harder, particularly when their name is not on the ballot, as President Trump has,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he is not just doing it at these rallies, but he\u2019s been doing it every single day by impacting good policy and making our country better. You can see that every single thing he has done, whether it\u2019s growing the economy, which he\u2019s put such an emphasis on, whether it\u2019s securing the border, you\u2019re going to see him talk about those things tonight.\u201d\n\n", "Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said on Monday \u201cwe will proudly break the sanctions\u201d that went into effect as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year. | STR/AFP/Getty Images Foreign Policy Iranian president vows he will defy new U.S. sanctions\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani pledged Monday that his country would not buckle under the weight of newly re-imposed U.S. sanctions, calling the penalties on its oil and banking sectors \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cagainst the law, U.N. resolutions and international accords.\u201d\n\nIn a nationally televised address, Rouhani said that \u201cwe will proudly break the sanctions\u201d that went into effect at midnight as a result of President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal earlier this year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin shared more details about the sanctions, which they described as the strongest and most comprehensive ever imposed by the United States on Iran.\n\nThe latest round targets more than 700 individuals, entities, aircraft and vessels \u2014 above and beyond sanctions in place before the nuclear deal was struck in 2015. The Trump administration says its goal is to financially starve the Iranian government so that it fundamentally changes its behavior, including ending its support for terrorism.\n\nHowever, eight \u201cjurisdictions\u201d were given waivers that allow them, for now, to keep importing oil from Iran: China, India, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey.

He did not give many details but said the exemptions would be \u201cvery narrow\u201c and \u201ctime-limited.\u201d\n\nThe secretary of state said the United States remains interested in reaching a new agreement with Iran that covers its nuclear activities and other points of dispute. But Iran must \u201cabandon its revolutionary course,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. sanctions are particularly harsh because they not only can be levied on Iranian businesses but also on entities outside Iran that do business in the Middle Eastern country. Although some European governments, including Britain, France and Germany, are seeking to find alternatives so that they can keep trade going with Iran, many international firms have nonetheless already pulled out of Iran to avoid hefty U.S. fines.\n\n\u201cWe will be strictly enforcing our sanctions,\u201d Mnuchin warned.\n\nTrump teased the sanctions last week on Twitter with a photo-shopped reference to the TV show \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d writing that \"sanctions are coming.\" Asked whether using such a meme was appropriate, Pompeo pointed to reports that Qassem Soleimani, a feared Iranian military leader, had used his own version of a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d meme to respond to Trump, promising to \u201cstand against\u201d him.\n\n\u201cThis is a man who has American blood on his hands,\u201c Pompeo said.\n\nOver the weekend, Pompeo promised that the re-imposition of the sanctions will have the intended effect of altering Tehran\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident that the sanctions that will be reimposed this Monday, not only the crude oil sanctions but the financial sanctions being put in place by the Treasury Department of over 600 designations of individuals and companies in Iran, will have the intended effect: to alter the Iranian regime\u2019s behavior,\u201d Pompeo said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s our expectation. It\u2019s the reason for President Trump\u2019s policy.\u201d\n\nA defiant Rouhani disputed that on Monday, arguing that the waivers already show that the White House\u2019s threats are toothless.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic can sell its oil, and even if these eight countries weren\u2019t exempted, we would have still sold our oil,\u201d Rouhani said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that success?\u201d", "HOW REPUBLICANS CAN KEEP THE HOUSE -- Ryan phones Trump -- WOMAN POISED TO JOIN SENATE GOP LEADERSHIP -- Obamacare repeal still on the table?\n\nBy Nolan D.

Some even want Cruz to lose. \u201cAnd all of them are baffled by the disconnect between the superior branding of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s candidacy and what they see as the tactical malpractice of his campaign,\u201d Alberta adds.

And even with a House majority, they wouldn\u2019t have the numbers. \u201cRepublicans\u2019 advantage in the chamber would shrink to just two or three votes under even the rosiest midterm projections, leaving virtually no room for error in rounding up votes for a repeal package guaranteed to be divisive,\u201d he adds. \u201cA Republican-controlled Congress, with an eye toward reelecting President Donald Trump in 2020, could pursue party-unifying issues instead, like another round of tax cuts Trump dangled before the midterms. But take up Obamacare repeal again and the GOP would invite another brutal, months-long health care war facing long odds and littered with stumbling blocks.\u201d More: https://politi.co/2Peo3xN\n\nTRANSITIONS -- Mathew Weidinger will be a resident fellow in the economic policy department at the American Enterprise Institute.

We\u2019ve got a rundown of the campaigns before tomorrow\u2019s big day.\n\nTHE BUZZ\n\nA hoarse but energized Barack Obama got sentimental Sunday while in Chicago to campaign for J.B. Pritzker, Kwame Raoul and other Illinois Dems. It was 10 years ago to the day he won the presidency. \u201cWhen the cynics said we couldn\u2019t, we said, \u2018Yes, we can.\u2019 And that night we said that, yes, we did,\u201d he told the crowd 5,000-plus at the UIC Pavilion. \u201cGoodness and decency is still out there. Kindness is still out there. Generosity is still out there. Hope is still out there. We just have to stand up and speak for it.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat was it for sentimentality. Obama\u2019s 45-minute speech hammered at Republicans for, among other things, \u201cblatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying.\u201d Obama took issue with the current administration\u2019s stances on immigration, tax cuts for the wealthy and, especially, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIsn\u2019t it funny, he said in a folksy, relaxed way, that Republican candidates are clamoring to support insurance coverage for pre-existing medical conditions even though they voted against that while in Congress. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of gall. That\u2019s a lot of nerve. That\u2019s a lot of chutzpah,\u201d Obama said. He used the discussion of ACA to give a hat tip to Lauren Underwood, the nurse running to unseat Republican incumbent Randy Hultgren in the exurban 14th District. Underwood worked for the Obama administration and its efforts to write Obamacare, as the ACA is called.\n\nDemocats hung on Obama\u2019s words and the rhythm and color that define how he speaks. But this Obama also took a sharp turn to attack Republicans. It was unlike the speech he gave 10 years ago.\n\nOn Sunday night, Obama criticized the White House for trying to distract voters with the trumped-up drama about the immigrant caravan. \u201cDon\u2019t be hoodwinked, don\u2019t be bamboozled. Do not fall for the okey-doke,\u201d Obama said of the GOP rhetoric. And he poked fun, saying if Republicans \u201creally cared\u201d about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, they would also care about the Chinese listening to the president\u2019s cell phone. It was one of the many lines that drew big applause.\n\nNew voice or not, it was music to the ears of the 5,000-plus supporters, many of whom waited in line in the rain to get in to hear him speak. They cheered and whooped and a few booed at mention of the Trump administration, prompting Obama to say repeatedly, \u201cDon\u2019t boo. Vote.\u201c\n\nObama wrapped up by locking hands with Pritzker and lieutenant governor candidate Juliana Stratton. And he gave hugs to congressional candidates Underwood and Sean Casten, state Comptroller Susana Mendoza and Treasurer Mike Frerichs. When Obama approached Kwame Raoul for a similar embrace, the state senator in a tough battle for attorney general gave the former president a giant bear hug. Raoul holds the seat once held by Obama. Sentimental indeed.

Rauner, too, led a rally for Republicans in one Cook County stop in Orland Park. At Honest Abe\u2019s Tap & Grill in Morris, the governor spoke of an uphill battle back to a second term, while warning it would be \u201ca nightmare\u201d for the state to elect Democrat J.B. Pritzker. \u201cPeople are counting us out now. They\u2019re saying, \u2018Oh the polls are showing this or that,'\u201d Rauner said. \u201cYou know what? The polls are baloney.

Pritzker and Barack Obama talked Sunday about electing Democrats to keep a check on government. So POLITICO asked Pritzker how that differs from Republican Erika Harold saying she\u2019s the best candidate to keep a check on government in Illinois. She\u2019s a Republican after all. Isn\u2019t it the same thing? Pritzker says \u201cit\u2019s not about Democrat or Republican.\u201d The attorney general job is \u2018independent\u2018 of what goes on in the governor\u2019s office, Pritzker said.

One more day!\n\nNEW CLOUT IN THE HOUSE? \u2014 Massachusetts will be in \"good shape\" if Democrats flip the House tomorrow, Rep. Jim McGovern said at a campaign event in Worcester yesterday. And he's got a point. If Democrats regain the majority like the polls suggest, the state delegation is going to have some serious clout.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nRep. Richard Neal is in line to become chairman of the powerful House Committee on Ways and Means, meaning the Springfield lawmaker would hold the keys to the government's revenue raising. That means the hot button issues of this election cycle \u2014 taxes, tariffs, Social Security, unemployment and Medicare \u2014 will be under Neal's jurisdiction in the House.\n\nMcGovern is poised to become chairman of the House Rules Committee. That means he'd be in charge of which bills come to the floor for a vote. And because Democrats have their eyes on everything from immigration, to health care, to gun reform, to money in politics, some pivotal bills would be coming down the pike.\n\nRep. Katherine Clark is running for the number five leadership spot. Her recruitment role for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee means she'd be credited with playing a key role in building the new majority \u2014 and she'd have relationships with many of the incoming freshmen in what could be a sizable and influential class.\n\nAnd then we've got the younger rising stars of the delegation \u2014 Rep. Seth Moulton, Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Democrat Ayanna Pressley, set to win the 7th District seat on Tuesday amid national attention.\n\nMoulton has been minting money for candidates via his leadership PAC (his Serve America PAC has raised the third-highest total among Democrats this cycle), and if the candidates stumping on ousting Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are successful tomorrow and stay true to their word, he'll have some company in his push to shed the old guard in the House.\n\nKennedy, by virtue of his famous last name and his willingness to speak out on national issues, isn't going anywhere. He's spent the fall crisscrossing the country for Democrats in tight races. He's already a key player in the party \u2014 Democrats tapped him to give the State of the Union rebuttal speech in January.\n\nAnd although she's played her cards close to the vest, campaigning primarily in-state and focusing less on national news appearances, it's hard to forget the kind of lightning in a bottle Pressley captured in September. A five-person television crew profiling Pressley waited for her to finish snapping iPhone photos and talking to supporters at a canvass event Sunday afternoon for the Democrat trying to unseat state Rep. Jim Lyons, Tram Nguyen, in North Andover. After the votes are counted Tuesday night, Pressley's first order of business is crafting \"inclusive\" transition and congressional teams, she told me. Well, after a nap, she said.\n\nTHE POLLING SKEPTICS \u2014 Should we trust the polls? Jay Gonzalez, for one, says no. Stumping at a get out the vote event in Worcester, the Democratic candidate for governor, who is very, very down in the polls compared to Gov. Charlie Baker, had a message on Sunday \u2014 don't listen to the numbers.\n\n\"As recent elections have shown us, polls and money aren't what decide them. Polls have been way off. Pundits are way off,\" Gonzalez told reporters. \"I am really confident we're going to surprise a lot of people on Tuesday.\"\n\nAt that same event in Worcester, Attorney General Maura Healey looked back on her 2010 upset. \"The polls had me down double digits a week out from the election. I was not the favorite candidate in the polls. The establishment had written me off, there was a whole bunch of money on the other side,\" Healey said. \"Election day came and we won we own big.\" Healey did crush Warren Tolman in the primary for AG in 2010. She got 62 percent of the vote and he picked up 38 percent.\n\nAyanna Pressley beat two-decade Rep. Mike Capuano by 17 points in September. Polls conducted a month out from the election had her down by a steady 13 points. \"These polls can't capture the electorate that is being expanded in response to the current climate in Washington and what is happening in our country,\" Pressley told reporters in North Andover on Sunday.\n\nAnother candidate hoping she can beat the odds and capture a shifting electorate is progressive Democrat Tram Nguyen, who is gunning for conservative state Rep. Jim Lyons' seat to represent North Andover, Andover, Tewksbury and Boxford. The 2016 election and the Women's March were a turning point for her, Nguyen told me on Sunday night, and she's trying to turn out voters who feel the same way.\n\n\"We're trying to bring out people who are now just getting interested in local politics. We're targeting groups who have never come out before,\" Nguyen said, adding several political groups sprung up in the district after the 2016 election. \"Many of these organizations are made up of more women who are now looking at politics and realizing 'Wow, this really does have a very big impact on my life. I should start paying attention.'\"\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook? Get in touch: smurray@politico.com.\n\nTODAY \u2013 Gov.

Nationally, Democratic women are fleeing the Republican party, threatening to swing a host of offices to Democrats, while men still tilt right. But women here in Massachusetts prefer Baker over Democrat Jay Gonzalez by about the same margins as do male voters. This was by no means expected.

The numbers are in their favor. Of the 200 seats in the Legislature, only 72, or 36 percent, are being contested. That means 115 Democrats and 13 Republicans are already assured of victory on Tuesday.

Patrick O\u2019Connor, a Republican elected in a special election two-and-a-half years ago to a Weymouth-based Senate seat, has racked up endorsements from both statewide teachers unions as well as the Boston Teachers Union based on his support for school funding and opposition to charter school expansion.

The United States has been at war for seventeen years, but, at the V.F.W., the events of the previous century still loom largest; the men\u2019s room is adorned with stickers about Hanoi Jane. On Friday, Mikie Sherrill, a forty-six-year-old former Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, took a seat in the front of the room and prepared to make her case. ...

Bob Menendez , the Stockton Polling Institute \u2014 the same pollster that shocked everyone by showing Menendez leading Republican Bob Hugin by just 2 points \u2014 showed Menendez ahead by 12 points .\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo, on the one hand we have data that does not show a toss-up race. (FiveThirtyEight has Menendez at over a 90 percent chance of winning). The House race polls have been good for Democrats, too. On the other we have anecdotes and nervous Democrats who are not on the campaign but have seen troubling county and congressional internal data for Menendez. And Hugin is running around saying his internal polls show him 2 points ahead (In my opinion, people talking about internal polls but not providing them should be treated the same as anecdotal evidence). But you know Democratic concern is real when D.C. Dems keep buying ads.\n\nSo here\u2019s the situation, best as I can read it: Democrats not on the Menendez campaign are convinced Hugin has a significant chance at winning. This feeling is likely reinforced by Menendez\u2019s weak showing in the June primary. The Hugin campaign, obviously, is sounding confident. And those I\u2019ve talked to on the Menendez campaign, even on background, are totally confident. But regardless of the polls that show Menendez winning, Democrats not on the campaign aren\u2018\u2019t as confident. Patrick Murray, New Jersey\u2019s leading pollster, is pointing to his poll from last month that showed Menendez with a 9-12 point lead and doesn\u2019t think much has changed since then.\n\nData is a better indicator than anecdotal evidence. It can also be flawed. So what do I think about this race? Sorry, but I really don\u2019t know.\n\nOne day to go until polls open.\n\nWHERE\u2019S MURPHY?

Transit commute mess: \u2018A level of incompetence I\u2019ve never quite seen before\u2019\u201d by The New York Times\u2019 Patrick McGeehan: \u201cNew Jersey Transit faced another round of major delays on Friday that infuriated thousands of commuters, capping a week of problems that symbolized its descent from one of the nation\u2019s best railways to one of its most troubled. The cascade of problems increased pressure on Gov. Philip D. Murphy, who has made revitalizing the railroad a priority after taking office this year. Just as the Friday commute was starting, an Amtrak car derailed in one of the two single-track tunnels under the Hudson River between Pennsylvania Station and New Jersey, officials said. No injuries were reported, but the effect on the commute was significant. Amtrak reported delays of up to an hour for the commuter railroads that share Penn Station with Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road. Trains were largely on schedule again by early afternoon. The delays have become a familiar refrain to riders of New Jersey Transit, the country\u2019s second busiest railroad, and [the] bleak streak has raised the political heat on Mr. Murphy, a Democrat, who called the transit system a `national disgrace\u2018 when he ran for governor last year.\u201d Read the report\n\nHE TAKES NO PLEASURE IN THIS AT ALL \u2014 \u201cSweeney will stay out of Alvarez probe,\u201d by The New Jersey Globe\u2019s Nikita Biryukov: \u201cSenate President Steve Sweeney started to steer clear of the Select Committee\u2019s investigation into Gov.

Sweeney deferred a number of questions, including ones on the timeline and scope of the investigation to Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, who, along with Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin, is the select committee\u2019s co-chair.

Further, Weinberg said the Federal Transit Administration has changed the cost-sharing formula.

Both hope to succeed Republican Mayor Frank Druetzler, who opted not to run for another four-year term after 32 years in office. But neither will agonize if the other wins and Cortese will have two years left on his three-year council seat while Karr will have one year left. \u2018He's a gentleman.

The town-by-town prohibitions have been approved by municipal government throughout the state in anticipation of a state law that would legalize cannabis sales for recreational use. Legalizing marijuana has been one of Gov. Phil Murphy's biggest policy pushes. The details of a law that would do that are continuing to be debated in the state Legislature. Meanwhile, the volume of the bans will be one of the determining factors in how easy it could be to obtain marijuana if recreational sales become legal or if medical uses are expanded. \u2018I think this is the biggest issue by far locally,\u2019 Alyssa Dawson, a Republican councilwoman running for re-election in Westwood, said ... Across the country, 62 percent of Americans are in support of legalization of marijuana and the number jumps to 74 percent among Millennials, according to data released by the Pew Research Center.

But it is one of the many great contradictions of the Trump era that his own party in his own state may suffer as a result of his presidency. Historians would be challenged to find a precedent.\n\nWhat would not be a challenge, however, is compiling a list of nationally significant New York Republicans since the turn of the 20th century: Nobel Peace Prize winners Theodore Roosevelt and Elihu Root, Governor and Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Charles Evans Hughes, rackets-buster, Governor, and Thruway namesake Thomas E. Dewey, and a pair of four-termers, Senator Jacob Javits and Governor Nelson Rockefeller himself.\n\nTheir once-vaunted party faces the prospect of demolition tomorrow, and the New York Republican in the White House may bear a good portion of the blame. \u2014 Terry Golway\n\nIT\u2019S MONDAY.

Dan Donovan . He didn\u2019t mention the president, Donald Trump, either. Instead, he shook hands, promised a new bipartisan future if he\u2019s elected to Congress Nov. 6, and doubled down on their shared service. \u201cHey everybody, Max Rose, running for Congress, I\u2019m a vet as well,\u201d he told the group of about 60 veterans and their families, sitting at round tables covered with vinyl tablecloths, waiting for a catered hot lunch provided by local restaurants. Still, it was clear that Trump was very much on the minds of some of the veterans whose vote Rose was trying to win. After all, while Rose is running for Congress in a city that\u2019s one of the country\u2019s liberal bastions, this is a district where Trump is not, for a change, the bogeyman. The key to winning for Rose won\u2019t be his ability to motivate the liberal Democratic base, as it might be in other districts. Instead, he\u2019s got to win over the independent voters who helped make Staten Island the one New York City borough to vote for Trump in 2016. Read more here .\n\nKING OF LONG ISLAND \u2014 Rep. Pete King of Long Island is something of a throwback \u2014 while he was elected to the House in 1992, the year George H.W. Bush was denied a second term as president, in many ways he is an old-fashioned Reagan Republican. This year, King is facing an aggressive challenge from Liuba Grechen Shirley, one of the many Democratic women running for Congress in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement and the more general mobilization associated with the Trump era. According to Larry Levy, executive director of Hofstra University\u2019s National Center for Suburban Studies, King \u201chas more of a challenge then he\u2019s seen as a while, [against] a candidate who seems to fit the profile of the sort of Democrat who has been doing better than expected around the country in terms of enthusiasm and fundraising.\u201d Our Bill Mahoney spent some time in the district recently, speaking with both candidates.\n\n\u201cReporters keep trying to define this movement as part of the blue wave, or part of the pink wave, what makes this year so different,\" Shirley, who is 37 and has previously worked in economic development at the United Nations, told Bill. \"And I think the thing that\u2019s most different about this year is we have a wave of average working Americans running for office. If you look at the people running \u2026 It\u2019s not the same old lawyers who come from political families.\u201d\n\nKing, for his part, emphasizes that he worked across the aisle on topics like aid for Sept. 11 survivors, and is the only remaining House Republican who voted against Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. As he readily notes, he\u2019s frequently ranked by the Lugar Center as the most bipartisan member of Congress. \u201cYou can\u2019t categorize me one way or the other, because I take the issues on as they come on; I\u2019m an independent,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get things done, you can\u2019t be demonizing the enemy, you can\u2019t make believe the other guy\u2019s a bad guy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that King has felt the need to work harder than usual this year. But is he actually vulnerable to a Democratic onslaught tomorrow? \u201cIf there is a blue tsunami,\u201d Levy said, \u201cPeter King is probably the last Republican to get washed out to the political sea.\u201d \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Bill Mahoney.\n\nDATA DU JOUR \u2014 FIRST IN NY PLAYBOOK: With Election Day tomorrow, a source pointed us to how Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) has spent more than $21,000 on campaign funds on trips to Pebble Beach and Montana and other tickets in the third quarter. That total includes $9,000 on tickets at Capital One Arena, $2,685 on tickets for the Washington Nationals, $8,400 on fundraising tickets for the Richmond Raceway and over $800 on tickets on river trips in Montana.\n\nSince 2014, his campaign has also spent around $23,000 (including that $2,685 expense in the third quarter) on Washington Nationals tickets. Asked for comment, Nicholas Weinstein, Reed\u2019s campaign manager, told us: \u201cThe expenses referenced are for fundraising.\u201d Tracy Mitrano, Reed\u2019s Democratic opponent, told us in an emailed statement: \u201cThese discoveries are not at all surprising, because Congressman Reed has a long track record of taking special interest money. With it, he lives a lavish lifestyle and directs money to his family\u2019s businesses. Reed also profits off his own constituents\u2019 medical expenses through his family\u2019s medical debt collection company. \u2026\n\n\u201cIt is important for voters in New York\u2019s 23rd district to know that Reed uses his campaign funds to advance himself and the interests of his donors, not on improving his district. It is clear Washington has corrupted Reed and truly made him an insider.\u201d\n\nALSO \u2014 The Olena Times Herald reports that \"a paid staff member of the Tracy Mitrano congressional campaign team resigned Saturday after the Tom Reed campaign disclosed a vulgar posting on her Instagram account.

While Democrat Nathan McMurray barnstormed the 27th Congressional District's eight counties, his opponent, Republican Rep. Chris Collins of Clarence, appeared to have a more limited campaign agenda. His spokeswoman, Natalie Baldassarre, said Collins attended a pancake breakfast at the Rochester Brooks Gun Club in the town of Rush as well as an event hosted by the Mount Morris Fire Department. Earlier requests for Collins' campaign schedule prompted Baldassarre to reply: \u2018If there are any events the press is allowed to be at, we will let you know.\u2019 Asked about Collins' effort to turn out Republican voters Tuesday, Baldassarre said: \u2018Our campaign is executing a data-driven grassroots effort \u2013 including digital, mail, and phones \u2013 to turn out identified voters.\u2019\u201d [Buffalo News\u2019 Jerry Zremski\n\nTHE NY-19 BELLWETHER \u2014 \u201cThe Democrats thought they had the most devastating weapon: a political video showing the Republican incumbent hugging a young mother with a brain tumor and spinal condition, and promising to protect her coverage of pre-existing conditions \u2014 only to vote for the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare weeks later.

Andrew Cuomo to Republican challenger Marc Molinaro by a 49-36 margin, according to a poll released by the Siena College Research Institute on Sunday. Cuomo's 13-point lead in the five-way race is a significant decrease from past polls. In a survey released at the beginning of October, Siena found Cuomo with a lead of 22 points at a time when there were six candidates in the race, including Cynthia Nixon. In a one-on-one match with Molinaro, Siena gave Cuomo an 18-point lead. A Quinnipiac poll from mid-October found Cuomo with a 23-point edge in a one-on-one contest. Cuomo\u2019s favorability rating also fell to the lowest level in the eight years since he\u2019s been in office, with 45 percent of likely voters viewing him positively and 49 percent holding a negative view. The shift is due in part to Molinaro making gains among his base. Republicans supported him 59-21 a month ago; they now back him by a 74-12 margin. [POLITICO\u2019s Bill Mahoney]\n\nMOLINARO CONFIDENT \u2014 The Republican candidate for governor is framing a new poll as a scene-setter for mid-1990\u2019s history to repeat itself in a GOP upset come Tuesday.

He\u2019ll be joined by his top national security officials, along with first lady Melania Trump, for a weekend getaway that could also be an escape from bruising election results.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt will also be a chance for Trump to refocus on foreign policy after a midterm campaign focused mostly on domestic issues. Trump may meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will also attend the celebration at Paris\u2019 Arc de Triomphe. French President Emmanuel Macron will likely want to discuss fresh U.S. sanctions Trump has slapped on Iran, which Paris and other Western European allies strongly oppose.\n\nTwo weeks after his return, Trump will head abroad again for a G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, where he plans to talk with Chinese leader Xi Jingping amid a burgeoning U.S.-China trade war that has rattled global markets.\n\nForeign policy experts predict he\u2019ll use his bully pulpit to shift the conversation to foreign policy and national security, especially if Republicans lose the House as many Republicans expect and suffer loses at the state level. This will give the chance to remind the world he\u2019s commander in chief regardless of any election results.\n\n\"He\u2019ll blame Paul Ryan, congratulate Mitch McConnell, and get on an airplane [to Paris] and still say: \u2018I\u2019m king of the world.\u2019 Of course, elections being so volatile, if he loses both houses, his ability to lead on the world stage will be vastly circumscribed,\u201d said Wendy Sherman, a former senior State Department official under President Barack Obama.\n\nForeign policy has often been a refuge for presidents dealing with scandal or a hostile Congress. Presidents have wide authority to direct diplomacy and the military without congressional approval. Should Democrats win the House, quashing hopes for new GOP legislation, Trump could put more energy into projects like nuclear talks with North Korea and his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran.\n\nFirst will come a reunion with Macron, last seen embracing Trump during an April visit to the White House before a speech to Congress denouncing Trump-style politics.\n\nExperts predict that Trump and Macron will discuss trade and tariffs, climate change, immigration, and relations with Russia. Macron will also likely share his frustration over Trump\u2019s clampdown on Iran, which France fears could lead Tehran to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal for which Paris played a key negotiating role.\n\nAlready, European allies are trying to circumvent the administration\u2019s new oil sanctions on Iran. On Friday, top officials from France, the European Union, Germany, and the U.K. condemned these sanctions in a joint statement for failing to deliver results in the same way as the nuclear deal, negotiated under Obama.\n\nTrump arrives in Europe as the continent struggles with its own massive political shifts \u2014 from German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to step down in 2021 to a March deadline for Great Britain\u2019s Brexit from the EU to Macron\u2019s slumping approval ratings.\n\n\u201cAll of our key partners in Europe are distracted by matters internal to Europe at this point. That is one challenge. But that may suit the president just fine. There will probably be a little less contesting in the areas where he has taken stands opposed to their interests,\u201d said Anthony Blinken, former deputy secretary of State and deputy national security adviser in the Obama administration.\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nYet the Paris trip is also the chance for Trump to revel in a pomp-and-circumstance military parade. Trump loved watching the traditional Bastille Day parade in Paris in July 2017, in which thousands of French troops and tanks made their way down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nTrump later told The New York Times in an interview that the celebration was \u201cone of the most beautiful parades I have ever seen,\u201d and he wanted to plan something similar down Pennsylvania Avenue to honor U.S. military veterans \u2014 until top officials estimated such an event would cost $90 million.\n\nHe scrapped the idea in a tweet in August, saying he instead looked forward to the Paris parade in November.\n\nAdministration aides and advisers say Trump derives immense satisfaction from the military trappings of the presidency, such as being surrounded by uniformed personnel, helicopters and planes.\n\nA grand Parisian ceremony would also provide Trump a mental break from the flood of potential investigations his White House will face if Democrats win the House. That could include everything from Democratic efforts to obtain his tax returns to probes into the ethics of Cabinet officials. Trump\u2019s foreign and trade policies could also come under tough scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIf one assumes the House will go Democratic, you will see a lot of activity in the Ways and Means Committee on trade, the budget, and the tariff war. There is bipartisan support for being tough on China, but not bipartisan support for the way the president has gone about it. How we are dealing with China will garner a lot of attention,\u201d Sherman said.\n\nHowever much Trump might enjoy a foreign getaway after a potentially depressing election, though, he remains deeply unpopular in France and throughout Western Europe. Some Republicans think he should spend more time in the coming months visiting countries \u2014 including Poland, Hungary and Italy \u2014 that are run by like-minded populists.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s friends are really in southern and central Europe. Those are the places for America to move the ball,\u201d said James Carafano, a former Trump transition official and top foreign policy scholar at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cHonestly, Europeans are not going to change what they think about Trump,\u201d he added. \u201cIf president wanted to move the ball forward, he should be in Warsaw and Budapest, not Paris.\u201d", "Okay, assume that $5 billion later, the midterms play out pretty much as everyone has expected for the past two years: Democrats take the House (and a clutch of governorships) and Republicans keep the Senate. What happens next? What happens when someone who is biologically incapable of acknowledging error faces the result of an election in which\u2014if the probable becomes real\u2014the character and conduct of the president was in fact the overwhelming reason for Republicans losing their stranglehold on Congress?\n\nIf history were a guide there would first be some humility. When the GOP lost the House and Senate in 2006, President George W. Bush called it a \u201cthumpin\u2019.\u201c When Democrats lost more than 60 seats in the House in 2010, President Barack Obama called it a \u201cshellacking.\u201d After that would likely come some roll-up-the-sleeves cooperation between a chastened but realistic White House and a newly ascendant opposition. After all, that\u2019s what happened with Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Truman, notwithstanding his denunciation of the \u201cdo-nothing 80th Congress!\u201d, worked with Republicans to shape a bipartisan postwar foreign policy. Reagan worked with Tip O\u2019Neill and Dick Gephardt in the House and Bill Bradley in the Senate to hammer out deals on Social Security and tax reform. (Note to Republicans: that tax reform deal raised the capital gains tax to match the tax on ordinary income and closed or slashed a passel of loopholes that benefited high-income earners.). Clinton, even as his reelection campaign assailed the \u201cDole-Gingrich\u201d Congress, joined his adversaries on matters from welfare reform to budgets.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut this is where present-day reality forces us to throw all that history out the window. Can anyone who has watched Trump over the past three-plus years reasonably expect a man who considers himself the greatest president ever to reconsider his standing? The far greater likelihood is that he will take credit for saving the Senate and insist that any Republicans who did win their House races got there because he carried them over the line, while the ones who lost would have been beaten worse if not for his intervention.\n\nThe more likely question, itself unprecedented, is whether the conspiracy-promoting president will regard the results themselves as legitimate. If Trump still believes that millions of votes from undocumented aliens deprived him of a popular vote victory in 2016, the odds are good that his Election Day tweets will recycle stories of noncitizens, caravan invaders or MS-13 gangsters casting countless illegal votes. His postelection response may well echo that of Charles Foster Kane when he responded to an election loss with a front-page banner headline on his newspaper: \u201cFRAUD AT THE POLLS!\u201d\n\nMore significant, Trump has been unique among presidents for his indifference, even hostility, to expanding his reach. In his campaign rallies, he has defined Democrats not as opponents, but as enemies. He doesn\u2019t charge them with embracing bad policies; he accuses them of wanting to see crime and joblessness increase. As he focuses obsessively with his 2020 reelection prospects, his root impulse to stoke his base makes outreach to Democrats hard to imagine. (Remember, this is the president who, in the midst of bomb threats and a massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, decided not to \u201ctone down\u201d his rhetoric because adoring crowds at his rallies demanded red meat). While he may offer words of encouragement on, say, infrastructure, the lifespan of such sentiments will be even shorter than it was a year ago when he spoke similar words to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nBut it is not only a stubborn and combative president that makes prospects of a post-midterm detente so unlikely. Consider what a Democratic House majority will look like. The new members\u2019 ideologies will likely range from Democratic socialist to ardently centrist, with pressure from the base to resist Trump at every turn. The incoming committee chairs are veteran members with a strongly liberal tilt, and with a clear appetite to begin using their power to investigate everything from possible Russian collusion to ethical and financial misdeeds. Manhattan\u2019s Jerry Nadler would chair the Judiciary Committee. Adam Schiff, whose near-daily broadsides attacking Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes have made him a CNN regular, would take over that committee, while Elijah Cummings would chair the House Oversight Committee. Even if impeachment does not move front and center, the opening weeks of the next Congress will see a blizzard of subpoenas summoning Cabinet officers, Trump family members and officials from his presidential campaign to face grilling from a majority that has been stewing for two years over purported misdeeds. If Trump has been in nonstop campaign mode for 2020, you can bet an emboldened Democratic Party will be equally focused on maximizing its advantage for the next presidential election. This does not portend an atmosphere where cooperation will bloom.\n\nNor should we forget the likely makeup of the Republican caucus. The most endangered Republican incumbents come from the steadily shrinking pool of (relative) moderates. From Leonard Lance in New Jersey to Mike Coffman in Colorado to Erik Paulsen in Minnesota to Rod Blum in Iowa, GOP incumbents with moderate voting records are in dire straits\u2014and that\u2019s before counting those who decided not to seek reelection at all. What this means is that the next Congress\u2019 House Republican caucus will be significantly more right-leaning than this one. It means the Freedom Caucus will be stronger, even if it can\u2019t pick the next speaker. It means the GOP caucus will likely howl at any move the president might make toward cooperation with a Democratic majority.\n\nThere is, I concede, one alternative hypothesis, which goes right back to the president. There is no fixed star to his political views (other than that \u201cothers\u201d\u2014immigrants and foreign leaders\u2014are malevolent dangers to the United States). And there is nothing more central to his self-image than that he never makes a mistake and that when something bad happens, it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s fault. It\u2019s possible he will lash out at the Republicans in Congress for a midterm defeat; indeed, he\u2019s already taken a shot at departing Speaker Paul Ryan for challenging Trump\u2019s constitutionally suspect view of birthright citizenship. It is conceivable that in a fit of pique, Trump will make temporary peace with Democrats on a bill to, say, lower drug prices or begin his long-promised infrastructure program. But that\u2019s still more of a remote possibility than a plausible reality.\n\nYes, history says presidents who preside over midterm losses reset their compasses and find a way to work with their adversaries. Sometimes they produce real and lasting results. But if 2016 taught us anything it\u2019s to embrace the cautionary note in those TV ads from Wall Street companies: \u201cPast performance is no guarantee of future results.\u201d\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author.", "Last month, President Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo used the anniversary of the Beirut Marine barracks bombings to slam Iran, an alleged culprit in the 1983 attack, in separate settings. | Oliver Contreras-Pool/Getty Images Foreign Policy Memes, hashtags and 'hypocritical holy men': Trump's information war on Iran From social media memes to reports on Iran's smog-filled air, the Trump administration has used every means to hammer Iran\u2019s leaders.\n\nSeven years ago, the Obama administration launched a \u201cvirtual U.S. embassy\u201d for Iran, a friendly, engaging online portal that gave Iranians a window on American democracy and information about cultural exchanges.\n\nThese days, the website sends a different message.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nInstead of being packed with soft profiles of Iranian-Americans and presidential greetings on Muslim holidays, it touts the latest U.S. sanctions on Iran, features speeches deriding Iran\u2019s leaders and profiles Americans detained in Iran. A window pops up quoting President Donald Trump: \u201cThe Iranian regime\u2019s longest-suffering victims are its own people.\u201d\n\nThe virtual embassy\u2019s change in tone is just one example of how, in lieu of a traditional war with Tehran, the Trump administration has launched an information war instead.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

A Persian-language Twitter account the Obama administration launched to spread cheery images of America and its leaders is now used to mock and criticize Iranian leaders. Anniversaries of tragic events that were once marked with sober remarks now also include forceful condemnations of the Iranian regime.\n\nThe latest salvo on Friday came from Trump himself, just as oil-related sanctions on Iran were prepared to fully to take effect Monday. The president tweeted out a poster-like image of himself emblazoned with the phrase \u201cSanctions Are Coming, November 5\u201d using a font and slogan similar to ones from the HBO show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\nThe information campaign is arguably the most comprehensive the U.S. has ever run against Iran, according to foreign policy specialists. Even some critics of Trump\u2019s overarching Iran policy concede the messaging element is surprisingly creative and intense.\n\n\u201cWhat has been impressive is the rigor to which the administration has stuck to it,\u201d said Ned Price, an ardent Trump detractor who was a spokesman for the National Security Council under President Barack Obama. \u201cThey have not squandered a single opportunity to raise this, to harp on this, to even create opportunities to advance this messaging.\u201d\n\nIn addition to predictable denunciations of Iran\u2019s military and terrorist actions, the U.S. has highlighted Iran\u2019s water shortages and smog-filled air, detailed the financial corruption of the country\u2019s leaders and told the gut-wrenching stories of individual Iranian prisoners.\n\nAides to the president have cast the information campaign as part of a multi-pronged effort \u2014 which also includes sanctions like those that lock in Monday \u2014 designed to pressure the Iranian regime to change its behavior and act like a \u201cnormal\u201d country. The rhetorical rumble has intensified since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal in May over the objections of European and other countries.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration will continue to reveal the regime\u2019s illicit revenue streams, malign activities, crooked self-dealing, and savage oppression,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote in a Foreign Affairs essay about the administration\u2019s Iran policy. \u201cThe Iranian people themselves deserve to know the grotesque level of self-interest that fuels the regime\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian government has punched back with its own messaging offensive.\n\nPublicly, Iranian leaders often bash the U.S. government, recently saying the \u201cprotection of America\u201d emboldened Saudi Arabia to murder journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Privately, Iran is suspected of backing a disinformation operation targeting Americans. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube announced in recent months that they have removed numerous Iranian-linked accounts that were engaging in a yearslong scheme to manipulate Americans and push anti-Israel and pro-Iran narratives. The messaging potentially reached millions of people.\n\nThe State Department declined to discuss its information campaign, and U.S. intelligence officials would not say what sort of similar but covert operations are in play. But a former administration official familiar with the State Department\u2019s effort said there did not appear to be an overall guiding strategy, but rather a desire to try things and see what will work.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be very ad hoc,\u201d the former official said.\n\nLast month, for instance, Trump and Pompeo used the anniversary of the Beirut Marine barracks bombings to slam Iran, an alleged culprit in the 1983 attack, in separate settings.\n\n\u201cThe attack was carried out by Hezbollah, which Iran was instrumental in founding a year earlier to advance its radical agenda, and remain its main patron today,\u201d Trump said in remarks, referencing the Shiite Muslim militia the U.S. classifies as a terrorist group. \u201cAnd we are doing a big number on Iran today, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d\n\nPast administrations have also marked the deadly anniversary with somber statements. But Trump also used the occasion to sign into law new sanctions on Hezbollah, and the State Department quickly put up information about the legislation on the virtual embassy site.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s homepage, meanwhile, has been prominently featuring an \u201cIran Sanctions Countdown\u201d on its homepage ahead of Monday\u2019s oil-related sanctions deadline. The countdown lists the 12 demands that the United States has made against Iran, a list that effectively calls on the Iranian government to abandon its current foreign policy.\n\nThe homepage also prominently features a report titled \u201cOutlaw Regime: A Chronicle of Iran\u2019s Destructive Activities\u201d that U.S. ambassadors and embassies worldwide have tweeted out.\n\nThe document lays out many traditional U.S. complaints against Iran, including its support for terrorism. But one striking section details the dire environmental situation in parts of Iran, where water shortages are acute and air quality is poor. Such crises have recently sparked several protests in Iran.\n\nThe report argues that government mismanagement and corruption are causing Iran\u2019s environmental challenges. It argues, for instance, that excessive dam building has exacerbated water problems yet \u201clined the pockets\u201d of Iranian leaders and points out that Iran has been imprisoning environmentalists. (It\u2019s a focus that draws eye-rolls among Trump critics who note the president has been rolling back environmental protections at home.)\n\nPast U.S. administrations \u2014 Republican and Democratic \u2014 have tried to bypass Iran\u2019s government to directly reach its people, many of whom are young and believed to be pro-American in their personal views.\n\nThe Republican George W. Bush administration, which labeled Iran as part of an \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d and made democracy promotion a key part of his foreign policy, launched Radio Farda. The broadcaster tried to cut through Iran\u2019s state-controlled, anti-American media to offer more accurate picture of the United States.\n\nObama, a Democrat, also sought to engage Iranians in multiple ways as he pursued a deal to lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. The agreement was ultimately struck in 2015, with the support and help of China, Russia and the European Union.\n\nAside from the virtual embassy, Obama aides launched a Persian-language Twitter account, @USAdarFarsi, that tried to educate Iranians about U.S. democracy without being overly harsh on the government in Tehran.\n\nUnder Trump, however, the @USAdarFarsi account now routinely tweets out facts, figures and even cartoons that criticize Iranian leaders and praise ordinary Iranians who defy them. A major theme the account hits is how much money the Iranian regime sends to proxy militias elsewhere in the world \u2014 money that could have been spent on the Iranian people, it notes.\n\nThe account also features Iranian dissidents detained by the government, such as Hengameh Shahidi, a journalist and political activist. These tweets carry the hashtag #PrisonersofIran.\n\nOne popular recurring character on the various platforms is Brian Hook, the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Iran. Hook oversees the Iran Action Group, a team in charge of parts of the information campaign and making sure that other countries abide by U.S. sanctions on Iran. He also regularly gives speeches slamming Iranian leaders.\n\nPompeo is another frequently featured U.S. official in the information campaign. The secretary of State uses his own Twitter account to constantly needle Iran. In June, he tweeted out a chart of indeterminate sourcing that appeared to show the number of protests rising in Iran. \u201cHmm... Can this be explained?\u201d he asked in the tweet.\n\nHmm\u2026 Can this be explained? pic.twitter.com/wXXC8urswV \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) June 20, 2018\n\nTrump aides have also sought to win over the Iranian diaspora.\n\nIn July, Pompeo gave a speech to specially invited Iranian-Americans in which he detailed many of the regime\u2019s abuses \u2014 including the millions in assets hoarded by Iran\u2019s clerical leaders.\n\n\u201cThese hypocritical holy men have devised all kinds of crooked schemes to become some of the wealthiest men on Earth while their people suffer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has also touted an expansion of the Farsi-language broadcast offerings from U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and Radio Farda. The initiative, dubbed VOA 365, is expected to officially launch in January. Some videos available now cover major events in the U.S. as well as news relevant to Iran.\n\nOn the surface, the goal of the pugilistic rhetoric appears to be inflaming the Iranian people\u2019s discontent with their leaders while also turning Iran into more of a pariah globally. It\u2019s far from clear, though, how much success the campaign is having.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to gauge how many Iranians inside the Muslim-majority country are seeing the barrage of U.S. information, given the digital blockades that Tehran has erected. The U.S. Agency for Global Media, which is government funded but editorially independent, estimated that its outlets \u201creach 23.4 percent of Iranian adults on a weekly basis across all languages and media platforms.\u201d\n\nThe @USAdarFarsi account has also nearly doubled its following since Trump took office, according to the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine. But it\u2019s unknown how many of those followers are in Iran, where Twitter is supposedly banned.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s repeated public declarations that it is not seeking to oust the Iranian regime also may be confusing to Iranians, some analysts said. The administration says it wants the regime\u2019s behavior to change, but some experts say its public demands suggest that Trump\u2019s team wants a different government in Tehran.\n\n\u201cYou have a public diplomacy campaign that is effectively supporting regime change but can't speak its name,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran analyst at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility the Trump administration\u2019s message repels Iranians who fear that regime change would cause the country to descend into a chaotic battleground like nearby Libya and Yemen.\n\nThere are Iranians who think, \u201cOK, I may not be able to leave my house without my veil on, but at least I\u2019m not getting bombed every day,\u201d said Ariane Tabatabai, a political scientist with the RAND Corp.\n\nSome find the messaging hypocritical. In addition to the environmental disconnect, the same U.S. president who bemoans the victimization of the Iranian people has imposed a travel ban barring them from American soil.\n\nThe campaign appears aimed partly at Trump\u2019s domestic political base, including conservative pro-Israel groups who fear Iran\u2019s rise in the Middle East, some critics said. Several experts also questioned the accuracy of the information used by the Trump team, including its claim that Iran used much of its financial assets that were unfrozen by the nuclear deal to fund terrorism.\n\n\u201cI believe the script to be wrong and misguided and even deceitful in some ways,\u201d Price said.\n\nOthers applauded the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to pressure the government in Tehran.\n\nThe timing is particularly good now, some said, because the Iranian economy is in bad shape and the people\u2019s discontent is frequently manifesting itself in protests. These observers note that many Iranians were stung after Obama stayed largely quiet in 2009 when Iranian demonstrators hit the streets in what became known as the Green Movement.\n\n\u201cThe Iranian people aren\u2019t on the streets because of the U.S. government. They\u2019re on the street because they\u2019re fed up,\u201d said Mariam Memarsadeghi, co-founder of Tavaana, a group dedicated to helping civil society in Iran. \u201cWhen the regime and the people see the U.S. government constantly scrutinizing and aware of what\u2019s happening, the people will feel bolstered, and the regime will feel less confident that it can get away with violence against peaceful protesters.\u201d\n\n", "Employees work in Facebook's \"War Room,\" where employees fight misinformation on the platform.

And it\u2019s really difficult sometimes to vet that in real time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Election Day, if misinformation stays up for even a short time, if it goes viral, can really have suppressive effects,\u201d he added.\n\nThe warnings come as details emerge about increasing American election interference on social media, inspired by Russian tactics. Facebook said last month that it pulled down hundreds of U.S.-based pages and accounts that posted what the company called \u201csensational political content,\u201d saying they violated rules against spam, fake accounts and coordinated behavior. The deleted content included sources on both sides of the political spectrum, such as Right Wing News and left-leaning Reverb Press.\n\nNathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, told reporters at the time that Americans are posting most of the U.S.-focused election meddling content that appears on the social network these days.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense when you think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to run an information operation, the most important thing is that you understand the culture.\u201d\n\nIn mid-October, Facebook added misinformation about voting requirements to the list of content it will remove for being false.\n\nSocial media researchers say the dispersed nature of the midterm contests, with hundreds of races spread across the country, makes for particularly fertile ground for Americans who can pair their knowledge of local landscapes with Russian techniques for spreading divisive and inflammatory messages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to understand what\u2019s happening \u2014and influence what goes on \u2014 if you\u2019re in Texas as opposed to St. Petersburg or Tehran,\u201d said Nimmo.\n\nBut while Facebook and Twitter, under pressure to police their platforms, have announced take-downs of more Russian and Iranian accounts, Americans\u2019 use of social media to wreak election havoc is a much thornier issue for the companies.\n\nWhile U.S. law and norms restrict foreign activity during elections, removing domestic content exposes the companies to charges that they\u2019re censoring American speech \u2014 something they\u2019re eager to avoid in the already tense political atmosphere around the tech industry in Washington. Republicans frequently accuse the internet giants of discriminating against conservative views.\n\nThe tug of war over access to the ballot box has been featured heavily this election season, the latest chapter in a long-running partisan fight over the sanctity of the vote in the United States.\n\nIn the Georgia governor\u2019s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp, for example, Abrams and others have accused Kemp \u2014 who as secretary of state is Georgia\u2019s top election official \u2014 of attempting to disenfranchise minority voters, including by removing them from registration lists. (Kemp has called that characterization \u201cabsolutely not true,\u201d saying some of the removals were the result of poorly completed voter registration forms.)\n\nAnd President Donald Trump \u2014 who has long complained, without evidence, of massive voter fraud \u2014 issued a tweet three weeks before Election Day declaring that anyone engaging in such activity will be subject to \u201cmaximum penalties.\u201d Warned Trump: \u201cCheat at your own peril.\u201c\n\nElection watchdogs say the country isn\u2019t well prepared to separate true and false claims.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in \u2018Combating Misinformation Online 1.0\u2019,\u201d said Stephen Spaulding, chief of strategy and external affairs at Common Cause, an advocacy group that works on voting issues. \u201c2016 was a real wake-up call, and it\u2019s a little disheartening we still haven\u2019t figured this out.\u201d\n\nThe experts, however, agree that in these last days before Americans decide control of Washington, their focus is on bad behavior coming from inside the U.S.\n\n\u201cIt would be very convenient to blame all of this on Russia,\u201d said Ben Scott, director of policy and advocacy at the Omidyar Network. \u201cBut it\u2019s quite clear that the vast majority of disinformation is a domestic phenomenon.\u201d\n\n", "Georgia is one of five states that still relies entirely on paperless voting machines, even as most others have switched to scanned-in paper ballots. | Tami Chappell/AFP/Getty Images Elections Voting machine errors already roil Texas and Georgia races The errors would appear to work to the advantage of Republican Texas Sen.

Seven states still use the paperless machines partially, including Texas and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe issue has prompted particular controversy this year in Georgia, where voting integrity groups filed a lawsuit demanding that the state switch to voting machines that use paper ballots. Their opponent in that suit was Kemp, who as secretary of state is Georgia\u2019s chief election official.\n\nIn a ruling in September, a federal judge declined to force Georgia to replace its paperless machines before Tuesday\u2019s midterms but agreed with plaintiffs that continued use of those systems could harm their constitutional rights to a free and fair election.\n\nSara Henderson, executive director of the voting rights group Common Cause Georgia, told POLITICO that Kemp\u2019s resistance to upgrading machines is \u201cnot protecting the voters, it\u2019s not doing what\u2019s right for Georgia and its election system.\u201d\n\nVoters cast ballots during the early voting period at C.T. Martin Natatorium and Recreation Center on October 18 in Atlanta, Georgia. Early voting started in Georgia on October 15th. | Jessica McGowan/Getty Images\n\nFor Kemp, she said, pushing back against pressure to upgrade election systems is political. In 2016, when the Obama administration moved to protect voting systems by classifying them as critical infrastructure, Kemp called the move unconstitutional. \u201cIt\u2019s a political thing for Brian Kemp to be able to say, \u2018Well I beat back these good-government organizations even though we\u2019re just trying to protect the voters.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven though Kemp has previously acknowledged the state needs a verifiable paper trail, he has dismissed the early-voting complaints.\n\n\u201cThey have no evidence and no witnesses. Just fake outrage and members of the media who care more about headlines than facts,\u201d Cody Hall, press secretary for Kemp, said in a statement to POLITICO.\n\nOn Sunday, Kemp provoked another outcry from voting integrity advocates for accusing Georgia Democrats of hacking the state's voter registration system without backing up the allegations with evidence. His office said that following a \u201cfailed hacking attempt\u201d it launched an investigation into the state\u2019s Democratic party.\n\nIn a CNN interview, his Democratic opponent Abrams said the inquiry just two days ahead of the vote was a \u201cdesperate\u201d move to \u201cturn the conversation away from his failures.\"\n\nIn Texas, Secretary of State Rolando Pablos denied that early voting problems were the result of a bug in the machine. Instead, he blamed human error, saying voters need to go through ballots more slowly and double check their selections before submitting.\n\nIn a video released Friday, Pablos told voters: \"Your votes will count, and your voices will be heard!\"\n\nBut voters' problems with electronic machines shouldn't surprise any state officials.\n\n\u201cThese voting equipment issues surface every election, ever since 2006 when these were widely deployed,\u201d said Marian Schneider, president of Verified Voting, an election integrity group that has advocated for states to stop using voting machines without auditable paper trails.\n\nIn fact, the machines stirred controversy years before that in states like Florida, where many counties briefly switched to paperless voting machines in response to the state\u2019s disastrous experience with punch card ballots during the 2000 presidential election. The results were not always pretty: In one local election in Palm Beach County, the electronic machines recorded 78 blank ballots in a village council race that was decided by four votes.\n\nSome Democrats such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. later tried to raise doubts about the integrity of the electronic voting machines that Ohio used during President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection victory \u2014 claims that the manufacturer, Diebold, denounced as \u201cerror-riddled.\u201d\n\nGeorgia uses Diebold AccuVote voting machines that it purchased in 2002. The chief complaints today are that units can glitch during the voting process and occasionally incorrectly register a vote. In Texas, 78 counties out of 254 use Hart InterCivic eSlate machines, which have reportedly switched some selections to the other party on straight ticket votes.\n\nDuring the runup to the 2016 election, notions of \u201crigged\u201d and \u201chacked\u201d elections began to chip away at voter confidence, and then-presidential candidate Donald Trump warned that Democrats might \u201crig\u201d the election. Now, election integrity advocates fear that those same ideas will pop up after the midterms.\n\n\u201cWhen you have candidates who have brought into the vernacular the terms \u2018hacked,\u2019 \u2018tampered\u2019 and \u2018rigged,\u2019 the faith in the system and the confidence of the process are at stake,\u201d said Gregory Miller, co-founder of the election integrity advocacy group OSET Institute.\n\nDespite some partisan divides over early voting complaints, Republicans and Democrats in Texas and elsewhere have stressed that upgrading voting systems shouldn't be a political issue.\n\nRepublican Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes, chairman of the state\u2019s Senate Select Committee on Election Security, said the problems with voting machines have been a major concern among Republican state lawmakers.\n\nHowever, he said, he doesn\u2019t believe the recent glitches have diminished confidence in the election. He said the machines can still accurately record votes if voters slow down when clicking through their ballots.\n\nHughes, who has also avidly supported increasing voter ID laws, said he was confident Texas lawmakers would pass legislation to slowly phase out the paperless voting machines with ones reinforced with a paper trail.\n\nMost Americans live in jurisdictions where they can vote with a paper trail, Hughes said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few areas where Texas is behind.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION: This story was updated after publication to correctly describe electronic voting machines in Georgia and Texas as both touchscreen and ones operated with dials.", "In a state leading the digital revolution, California voters love voting by mail, and the state has encouraged it. | Rich Pedroncelli, File/AP Photo Elections If the House comes down to California, get ready to wait California's voting rules could mean key races don't get decided for days \u2014 or weeks.\n\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 An election night blue wave Tuesday could slow down considerably by the time it reaches the California coast, making the rest of America wait to see who will control the House in 2019.\n\nForget staying up all night to find out who won congressional seats here: Strategists and campaign experts say it could take days \u2014 if not weeks \u2014 to determine victors in a series of tight and closely watched midterm races in Southern California.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe potential long wait is the product of generous provisions for California voters backed by the state's governing Democratic majority, and the continued abandonment of polling places in favor of mail-in ballots, which require more time to count and verify.\n\nThe California slow-vote-count scenario means that if the balance in the House is close, the entire country may have to wait to know whether Democrats take back the chamber.\n\nDemocratic strategist Katie Merrill fears the worst.

The once conservative bastion of Southern California has turned purple, and Democrats are fighting to take four seats there alone.\n\nThe battles include: CA-39 between Democrat Gil Cisneros and Republican Young Kim; CA-45 between incumbent Republican Mimi Walters and Democrat Katie Porter; and CA-48 between incumbent Republican Dana Rohrabacher and Democrat Harley Rouda.\n\nA smaller part of the county is in CA-49, long represented by Republican Darrell Issa, which serves as a perfect reminder for how long it can take to get results.\n\nTwo years ago, Issa's narrow win wasn't declared until the Monday after Thanksgiving, nearly three weeks after Election Day. That same seat \u2014 now an open race between Republican Diane Harkey and Democrat Mike Levin \u2014 is among the districts considered essential for Democrats to take over the House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been telling reporters for months, get your reservations for hotel rooms in Orange County,\u201d said Rob Stutzman, a GOP strategist who believes House control could come down to a handful of California seats in those Southern California suburbs.\n\nIn a state leading the digital revolution, California voters love voting by mail, and the state has encouraged it. For seven consecutive statewide elections, a majority have submitted ballots by mail.\n\nAnd they love to procrastinate, said Orange County Registrar of Voters Neal Kelley. He's expecting 60 percent of his county's 1.6 million voters to use mail ballots. Of those, 35 percent or more will turn them in at polling places or mailboxes on Election Day.\n\n\"Right there, you have another 10 days on top of the process,\" Kelley said.\n\nBut where Merrill predicted chaos, Kelley expressed confidence after 12 years at the helm. \"We're prepared for it; this is what we do,\" he said. \"This is not Palm Beach. I wouldn't equate it to that.\"\n\n\"I'm ready for the lawyers and ready for the observers,\" he added. \"Let's go. It's part of the process.\"\n\nCalifornia election data guru Paul Mitchell says the state is \u201cworking harder than just about anyone else in the country to make sure that every ballot is counted,\u201d and that has led to a protracted process that may be less than satisfying in an era of immediacy.\n\nAmong the reasons: California allows ballots that arrive three days late to count, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. If a ballot lands in the wrong county, state law allows four more days for it to get to the right office, Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cThat means you literally have seven days after an election where a county could still be receiving legitimate ballots,\u201d he said.\n\nEven voting in person can lead to delays in California. The state allows registered voters to cast provisional ballots if they arrive at a polling place that doesn't have them on the rolls. For the first time, in 2018, residents can cast a conditional ballot on Election Day without registering in advance. Such ballots require additional checks to make sure that voters haven\u2019t participated in other counties and meet eligibility criteria.\n\n\"There are a few things that may add a little bit of time to ballot counting, but they are all intended to protect the voting rights of eligible California voters,\" California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, California's top elections official, told POLITICO.\n\nSignatures \u2014 mismatched or missing altogether \u2014 are one of the biggest challenges in counting mail ballots, according to Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonpartisan group that has advocated many of the recent changes. It\u2019s the main way counties verify that a vote is legitimate.\n\nIn the past, a bad signature might have meant a vote was tossed out. But a September state law requires counties to give at least eight days\u2019 notice to voters whose ballot is jeopardized by a questionable signature.\n\nAlexander said she'd rather have registrars take their time than succumb to pressures to accelerate results.\n\n\u201cThe media has framed elections as a one-day sale, and it\u2019s not the case anymore,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cElections are a one-month-long activity now in our state, and certifying the elections are a one-month activity.\u201d\n\nMitchell, the elections expert, estimates county registrars will have 2 million to 3 million ballots left to count after Election Day out of about 12 million he believes will be cast statewide.\n\nIn the most competitive districts, he said, registrars may have to count as many as 30 percent of total ballots after the election. \"That means you're going to have to have some huge point spreads to call those races on election night,\" he said.\n\nMerrill and Stutzman believe Democrats stand to gain anywhere from two to six congressional seats this year in California. If that margin makes a difference nationally, watch out, Merrill said.\n\nShe has tried to \u201csound the alarm\u201d to make sure that state and local elected officials are prepared for the potential onslaught of attorneys, activists and party officials on their doorstep.\n\n\u201cOur hope is there are Democratic lawyers with go-bags in their front closet ready to go Wednesday morning,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them are definitely thinking about this.\u201d", "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has suggested Republicans could take another run at Obamacare repeal next year if they keep their majorities. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Health Care Would Republicans take another shot at Obamacare?

Tom Davis, who led the NRCC. \"It would not be the smart fight to pick.\"\n\nAny decision will hinge on Trump, who has recently been vowing to protect pre-existing conditions even though his administration joined a 20-state lawsuit aimed at eliminating the Obamacare patient protections \u2014 and he lamented just this past Friday that the GOP narrowly failed to gut the law.\n\nTwenty House Republicans (some of whom won\u2018t be back in 2019) voted against last year's GOP health care bill that passed by just four votes. Moderates worried it went too far to repeal popular provisions, like pre-existing condition protections, and conservatives complained it left too much of Obamacare in place. The bill, which Trump later dismissed as \"mean\" even after celebrating it in the Rose Garden, was dead on arrival in the Senate. And several variants also collapsed in the Senate.\n\nCrafting a repeal bill would be even tougher this time around. The House GOP conference will grow more conservative next year, as more moderate lawmakers retire or lose swing-district races. That will swell the ranks of the right-wing Freedom Caucus, giving even more sway to the group that nearly derailed Republicans' repeal effort last year for not eviscerating even more of Obamacare.\n\n\"The bill that would come through the House would arguably be more conservative\" compared with last year, a House Republican aide said. \"I just don't see how the path gets easier for us.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a problem in particular for the Senate, where any repeal bill would likely have to win over a combination of hardline conservatives, establishment Republicans and more moderate members, even if the GOP boosts its 51-49 majority by a few seats.\n\nGOP centrist Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) are still likely to be skeptical of any repeal bill. Last year\u2019s third GOP \"no\" vote, Sen. John McCain, has since died and been replaced by a more establishment Republican. But that addition was effectively canceled out when Democrats flipped an Alabama Senate seat by electing Doug Jones.\n\nHouse Republican leaders haven't said all that much recently about tackling Obamacare, though they maintained it's deeply flawed. Rank-and-file members vying for their political lives are tacking left in the meantime, insisting they'll preserve pre-existing condition protections they tried to gut last year.\n\nHouse and Senate aides say there's been little discussion of repeal, despite McConnell's suggestion of a revival. Senate Republicans haven't gotten any closer to 50 votes on a health plan since Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) led a last-ditch effort to repeal Obamacare last fall.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump administration health officials have pivoted from trying to bulldoze Obamacare to championing new policies providing a path around the law, basically making it easier for some people \u2014 particularly healthy ones \u2014 to buy less expensive health plans without full Obamacare patient protections and comprehensive benefits.\n\n\"You've already seen the repositioning,\" said Miller of AEI, pointing to the administration's attempts to take credit for the improving Obamacare markets.\n\nYet for all the reasons to run like mad from yet another repeal bid, Republicans refuse to rule out the possibility. That's partly over concerns that abandoning it altogether would enrage their conservative base. Further, they say holding onto the House would amount to an epic rebuke of Democrats' health care message.\n\n\"If we hold onto the House, then the Democrats took a big swing and a miss,\" said Pat Brady, a Republican consultant and former Illinois GOP chair.\n\nThat could be enough to convince a newly energized GOP to take another shot. While the path to any major Obamacare repeal is tightrope-thin, Republicans say it's not impossible.\n\nThe push would need to start in the Senate, where Republicans could leverage their slightly larger majority to refine the Graham-Cassidy blueprint, which would block grant most Obamacare funding and give states significant new flexibility to customize their health insurance markets.\n\nSenators would still need to sell the House on a plan that won't be conservative enough for many in the lower chamber. However, conservative lawmakers could decide to live with it if they determine it's their last best chance to whack the law and keep a campaign pledge.\n\n\"They more or less antagonized the half of Americans who wanted to repeal the ACA, and the other half who are mad at them for trying,\" said Doug Badger, a senior fellow at the Galen Institute. \u201cThe best way to get around that is to actually do something positive.\"\n\nEven then, it'd still be a long-shot that would eat up months of time and play to Democrats' advantage in 2020. The opposition from Democrats and activists who are now veterans of the health care fight could dwarf last year's debate.\n\nRepublicans, who've recently promised on the campaign trail to guard pre-existing conditions, could risk instant backlash if they embrace anything less than Obamacare's robust protections.\n\n\"For the like, four moderates that are left in Congress after this election, I think they're going to be very, very reluctant,\" one health care lobbyist with ties to the GOP said of attempting a full repeal.\n\nBut the most ardent repeal advocates argue that if they can save their House majority on Tuesday against the odds, then tackling a massive health care overhaul suddenly may not seem so far-fetched.\n\n\"It is unfinished business,\" said Badger. \"When the dust clears ... if in fact Republicans are still in the majority in both houses of Congress, then we certainly want to talk about it.\"", "Democrat Stacey Abrams has established a major online fundraising base that could start refilling her campaign coffers the moment a runoff is declared. | Jessica McGowan/Getty Images Elections Abrams, Kemp prepare for overtime in Georgia governor's race If neither candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote Tuesday, the nationally watched campaign will head to a December runoff.\n\nATLANTA \u2014 As voters and campaigns around the country get ready for Tuesday\u2019s climactic midterm elections, the candidates for governor of Georgia are already preparing for four weeks of overtime.\n\nThat\u2019s the scenario on tap if neither Democrat Stacey Abrams nor Republican Brian Kemp is able to clinch more than 50 percent of the vote in Tuesday\u2019s election \u2014 a distinct possibility given the too-close-to-call public polling and the presence of a Libertarian candidate, Ted Metz, on the ballot.

Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff, which became the most expensive House race in history.\n\nThe race between Abrams and Kemp has attracted outsize national attention. Kemp has been a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, who rallied for the Republican on Sunday, and Vice President Mike Pence also stumped in Georgia on Kemp\u2019s behalf. Abrams, who would be the first female African-American governor in U.S. history if she wins, has gotten support from former President Barack Obama and an array of Democratic surrogates.\n\nAttention on the race will only increase if it becomes the biggest contest left unresolved after the midterms and has the national political news mostly to itself, said Eric Tannenblatt, who served as chief of staff to former Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue, now the secretary of the Department of Agriculture.\n\n\"Money is not going to be a problem for the runoff, because there's going to be money that's pouring in from all over the place,\" Tannenblatt said. \"And especially given the historic nature of this election, which has clearly captured the attention of the national media.\u201d\n\nThe most recent precedent for a post-November runoff in Georgia was in 2008, when Democrat Jim Martin held Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss under 50 percent of the vote but Chambliss won by double digits in December.\n\nRepublicans argue that a runoff situation would be to Kemp's advantage, as runoff voters lean older and wealthier \u2014 traditional Republican-leaning categories.\n\nBut Abrams\u2019 campaign has put a strong focus on expanding the electorate, and Holder said this election could be different.\n\n\"I'm focused, as I said, on voting on Nov. 6, but I don't think a lot of the old rules apply,\u201d said Holder. \u201cLet's face it. You have an African-American woman who's running neck-and-neck with a sitting secretary of state with a statewide reputation. That breaks all of the old rules. I don't think a post-6th effort would necessarily adhere to those rules either.\"\n\nBryan Tyson, a Georgia attorney who specializes in campaigns and political action committees, said Democratic or Republican enthusiasm could increase even more in a runoff situation.\n\n\"With all the national attention that this race has gotten already, will the enthusiasm ramp up even more if there's a runoff?\" Tyson said. \"I don't know for the Democratic side if that will be the case or not, but I think that's one variable that is maybe going to be different in a Georgia runoff.\"", "President Donald Trump has already placed 1-in-6 judges on the circuit courts. Those 29 appointments are the most by any modern president in his first two years. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Legal Even if Democrats win, Trump has them beat on the courts 'This was a pivotal moment for the conservative legal movement. They have new life.'\n\nDemocrats could win the House on Tuesday. They may recapture the Senate and White House in 2020. But they\u2019re losing the federal courts for the long term, as President Donald Trump is rapidly ensconcing a conservative judiciary that will have the power to knock down liberal policies for decades to come.\n\nThe White House\u2019s relentless focus on remaking the nation\u2019s courts has injected a new and permanent strain of conservatism into the judiciary, seating dozens of Republican judges positioned to play a pivotal role in the most contentious cases of the next four decades \u2014 from abortion rights and affirmative action to environmental protections, financial regulations and presidential power. Some of the judges may even help decide whether Trump can unilaterally eliminate the birthright citizenship of undocumented immigrants\u2019 U.S.-born children.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd if Republicans maintain control of the Senate on Tuesday, as they\u2019re widely expected to, Trump will have free rein to continue naming conservatives to lifetime appointments on the bench.\n\nThe result is the prospect of a lasting conservative imprint on the judiciary, fulfilling a true long play led by Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nNan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, called it a rueful moment for liberals.\n\n\u201cNo longer will Democratic organizations, progressives, even independent groups, take the courts for granted,\u201d she said.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

And it\u2019s a vindication for Trump\u2019s electoral strategy in 2016, when he appealed to conservative voters by making an explicit promise to name like-minded judges.\n\n\u201cThe president only has power to do so many impactful things on his own,\u201d said Randy Barnett, a libertarian legal scholar and Georgetown Law professor. \u201cThis was a pivotal moment for the conservative legal movement. They have new life.\"\n\nAside from the Supreme Court, where Trump named Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the rightward shift may be most momentous in the 12 regional circuit courts that hear appeals, set binding precedents and often have the final say in the many cases the high court never takes up.\n\nTrump has already placed 1-in-6 judges on the circuit courts, some of which are closely divided between Republican and Democratic appointees. Those 29 appointments are the most by any modern president in his first two years.\n\nCounting both federal trial and appellate courts, Trump\u2019s 84 judicial appointments to date far exceed the pace set by President Barack Obama in his first two years.\n\nLower courts have provided repeated roadblocks to the GOP agenda in the past two years, rejecting various versions of Trump\u2019s travel ban, declaring Republican-drawn congressional maps unconstitutional, upholding the right of transgender people to serve in the military and \u2014 just this past week \u2014 ordering Ohio to allow purged voters to cast provisional ballots. Having more Republican judges means fewer such obstacles for Trump.\n\n\u201cHe has a very clear plan to take over the federal courts, from top to bottom,\u201d said Kristine Lucius, a former Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee aide and current executive vice president for policy at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cIt really will change the power dynamics.\u201d\n\nThe highest-profile seats in play are ones Democrats believe should have been theirs. Even before they blocked Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court in 2016, Republicans used Senate procedures to slow confirmations toward the end of his presidency. In its final two years, the Obama administration won confirmation of the fewest judges in the last two years of a presidency since Harry Truman.\n\nWhen Trump entered the Oval Office, he was greeted by an open Supreme Court seat, 106 other judicial vacancies and a Senate Republican conference willing to bust through the chamber\u2019s bipartisan customs to overhaul the courts at record speed.\n\nThe consequences over the next several decades could be profound, legal analysts say, and perhaps nowhere are the implications more apparent than in the fight over abortion.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s appointment energized an anti-abortion movement that now believes it has the five conservative justices needed to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case establishing the right to abort a pregnancy. Several cases winding through lower courts could soon provide that opportunity.\n\nOne case in Iowa would ban abortions at about six weeks, a clear challenge to Roe, which granted abortion rights up to viability which is generally considered around 23 or 24 weeks. Other states\u2019 restrictions aim to chip away at abortion protections more gradually, offering the Supreme Court the more politically palatable option of overturning more recent decisions first.\n\nOne likely target is the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-to-3 ruling in 2016 in the case Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, in which the justices rejected a set of Texas\u2019 restrictions on abortion clinics. Lower federal courts had issued divided rulings on similar restrictions in other states.\n\n\u201cThat was the last happy day pro-choice people have had dealing with the courts,\u201d said Carol Sanger, a Columbia Law School professor and abortion law expert, of the Whole Woman\u2019s Health decision. \u201cThere are all kinds of techniques being used to find little crannies where you could say, oh, here\u2019s a good place for regulation that will make it harder for women to get an abortion.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority could also make for a rightward turn on issues like affirmative action, gun control and campaign finance restrictions \u2014 areas where the GOP has bristled at federal involvement.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to continue to restrain Congress\u2019 regulation of campaign finance,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019ll be renewed skepticism of affirmative action.\u201d\n\nOne case still in limbo is a challenge to Harvard\u2019s affirmative action policies, being argued in a U.S. district court in Massachusetts. Both sides and the judge herself have predicted it will ultimately end up at the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd in the lower courts, the growing ranks of Trump appointees are likely to impose higher hurdles for citizens seeking to challenge government actions under foundational environmental laws like the Clean Water Act, swinging the legal odds toward big business even under the most progressive future Democratic presidents.\n\nFor example, conservative judges are more likely to require local environmental groups to show they have suffered direct harm before they can challenge permits allowing power plants to emit air pollution or discharge waste into waterways. These lawsuits have driven major changes in how the government applies environmental laws, much to the dislike of businesses and Republicans who call the suits frivolous.\n\nThe agencies creating the regulations could face more hostile treatment too, amid a push by conservative legal scholars to rein in the executive branch\u2019s ability to write rules unless Congress has explicitly called for them. Notably, Kavanaugh has spent years throwing his weight behind empowering judges to crack down on agencies.\n\n\u201cJudges, he has written, need to work harder to understand what the law is actually saying and not just throw up their hands and say, \u2018This is ambiguous,\u2019 and rule in favor of the agencies,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nObama-era financial rules have already seen some of that pushback. A judge appointed by President George W. Bush ruled in June that the single-director system at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unconstitutional, siding with Republicans who say the agency has abused its power. An appellate court recently came to the same conclusion about the federal agency that oversees mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nSome Trump judges have already made their presence felt.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, a 2017 appointee on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, joined four other Republican-appointed judges in blocking federal efforts to stop an employer from transferring employees based on their race or ethnicity. (She is also on Trump\u2019s short list for the Supreme Court.) Another 2017 appointee, Judge Amul Thapar of the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit, helped rule in favor of a Michigan county government\u2019s practice of opening sessions with Christian prayers.\n\nBut that represents just a preview of the Trump-era influence that could color court rulings for years to come.\n\nTrump\u2019s judicial picks are more conservative than most, say supporters and critics alike. And in many cases they are younger than the norm, meaning some could sit on the federal bench for the next 40 years or more. In October, Senate Republicans advanced the appellate court nomination of Allison Jones Rushing, who graduated from law school a little more than a decade ago and at age 36 is one of nation\u2019s youngest judicial appointees.\n\nAdvocates for transgender rights have expressed particular alarm that a more conservative slate of judges will make it harder for transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.\n\nIn a reversal of Obama's policies, Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her department have stopped investigating civil rights complaints filed by transgender students seeking bathroom access. Those students have achieved some federal court victories in recent years, but their supporters worry the tide may be about to change.\n\n\u201cTrump has nominated a litany of candidates from anti-LGBTQ groups,\" said Gillian Branstetter, a spokesperson for the National Center for Transgender Equality. \"It's clearly an attempt to flood the courts with judges who would rewrite the national understanding of federal civil rights law to fit their own bias and prejudice against transgender people.\u201d\n\nAnnie Snider, Katy O\u2019Donnell, Patrick Temple-West and Caitlin Emma contributed to this report.\n\n", "An audience member holds up a sign as President Donald Trump speaks in Estero, Florida, on October 31.

Three dozen governorships are up for grabs, and a quarter of them, nine, are rated as toss-ups going into Election Day, including four big prizes: Florida, Georgia, Ohio and Wisconsin. The president carried all four of those states in 2016.\n\nHouse\n\n\n\nWhile Democrats are favored to win control of the House, the majority will be decided by the nearly two dozen toss-up races that campaign operatives in both parties believe are virtual coin flips. Many of them have been among the most competitive and contested races all cycle, like a handful of races in Southern California, two contests in the Dallas and Houston suburbs, or two suburban Philadelphia seats.\n\nBut Democrats now have at least a modest advantage in some races previously seen as toss-ups, like the districts held by Republican Reps. Peter Roskam and Randy Hultgren outside Chicago or Rep. Mike Bishop in suburban Michigan. Democrats are also more optimistic about their chances in Miami, where former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala had been struggling to put away a district Hillary Clinton won by 20 points in 2016. And the party now feels it is favored to pick off GOP seats from southeastern Virginia\u2019s 2nd District to Orange County, California\u2019s 39th District.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Karen Handel, and the Columbus, Ohio-area district where now-Rep. Troy Balderson won by a single percentage point in August.\n\nDemocrats are also on offense in what has been more solidly Republican territory. The party is competitive in traditionally Republican areas of Florida, New Mexico and Utah. The indictments of Republican Reps. Duncan Hunter of California and Chris Collins of New York have unexpectedly brought their seats into play, even though Trump carried both districts easily.\n\nRepublicans have pulled a couple of seats back into their column over the final weeks, but they have mostly been in red territory, like an open-seat race in southern West Virginia where Trump won a whopping 72 percent of the vote in 2016.\n\nThere is some hope for the GOP: National polls show the generic ballot \u2014 voters\u2019 general preference for Congress \u2014 tightening in the closing weeks, as Trump\u2019s approval rating has also ticked up slightly.\n\nBut the district-level polling in most battleground seats \u2014 public and private \u2014 hasn\u2019t improved for the GOP. And senior House Republicans are nervous that Trump\u2019s late focus on immigration and cultural issues has deprived the party of any late momentum.\n\nSenate\n\n\n\nRepublicans remain favored to retain the Senate. Between the Republican-held seats not up for election this year and those rated as lean, likely or solidly Republican going into Tuesday, the party is at 50 seats \u2014 the bare minimum needed to control the chamber with Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s tiebreaking vote.\n\nThe three seats currently classified as \u201cLean Republican\u201d would foreclose any path for Democrats: GOP-held seats in Tennessee and Texas, and Heidi Heitkamp\u2019s reelection race in North Dakota. In Tennessee, GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn leads the Democrat, former Gov. Phil Bredesen \u2014 though strategists say her margin is smaller than the double-digit advantage she has in some public surveys.\n\nIn Texas, blockbuster early voting tallies and reportedly tightening polls have cast doubt about the size of GOP Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s lead over Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, but the incumbent senator is still a significant favorite on Tuesday.\n\nAnd Democrats insist Heitkamp can still come back \u2014 but concede she\u2019s trailing GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer.\n\n\u201cNever count out Heidi Heitkamp,\u201d Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cPeople did that six years ago when she was 10 points behind. She won that race. She\u2019s less than 10 points behind right now.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats can win one of those three races, they\u2019ll still need to sweep the five toss-up contests on Tuesday to win back the majority. Three of the five are in states that Trump carried and where Democrats are defending seats: Florida, Indiana and Missouri.\n\nRepublicans are convinced they have the advantage in both Missouri and Indiana. Of those, the Missouri seat \u2014 held by Sen. Claire McCaskill \u2014 is the most endangered. But public polls in recent days have McCaskill neck and neck with state Attorney General Josh Hawley, who had been ahead in some other surveys in October. And Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly led his GOP challenger, former state Rep. Mike Braun, in two public polls last week.\n\nThe Florida race \u2014 between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and GOP Gov. Rick Scott \u2014 is very close. Democrats claim a slim advantage, which is backed up by most public polls, but Republicans say the race is a dead heat.\n\nThen there are the two Republican-held toss-up seats: Arizona and Nevada. Both races are extremely tight, according to the balance of public and private polling.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jon Tester is still ahead in Montana in a race POLITICO rates as \u201cLean Democratic,\u201d though Republican state Auditor Matt Rosendale is within striking distance. In West Virginia, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is favored to defeat GOP state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and overcome his state\u2019s lurch to the right in recent years.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez enters Election Day with a lead in the polls over Republican Bob Hugin, though Menendez\u2019s favorable ratings are poor after a graft trial that ended in a hung jury last year.\n\nGovernors\n\n\n\nDemocrats appear poised to pick up at least three governorships on Tuesday. J.B. Pritzker has a big lead over Illinois GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner, Gretchen Whitmer is well ahead of Republican Bill Schuette in Michigan, and Democratic Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham is comfortably in front of GOP Rep. Steve Pearce in New Mexico.\n\nThe night could be better \u2014 a lot better \u2014 if most of the nine toss-up governor\u2019s races go the party\u2019s way. But Republicans can preserve much of their statehouse domination if their candidates succeed on Tuesday, especially in the largest toss-up states: Florida, Ohio, Georgia and Wisconsin.\n\nIn Florida, Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis are running close in the polls. It\u2019s the same story in Ohio, where Democratic former state Attorney General Richard Cordray and his successor, Mike DeWine, are neck and neck.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201810/2159/1155968404_5855294713001_5850601348001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nIn Georgia, if the margin is razor-thin between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp \u2014 as the polls suggest it is \u2014 then the presence of a Libertarian candidate on the ballot could deny either candidate a majority and force a Dec. 4 runoff.\n\nAnd in Wisconsin, GOP Gov. Scott Walker is in a fight for his political life. A Marquette Law School poll released last week showed him tied with Democrat Tony Evers.\n\nRaces are also roughly tied in a number of smaller states where Republicans hold the governor\u2019s office: Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Nevada and South Dakota.\n\nRepublicans are in the hunt for governorships in typically blue Connecticut and Oregon, though both states are rated as \u201cLean Democratic.\u201d And Republican Mike Dunleavy has a good shot at winning in Alaska, though independent Gov. Bill Walker\u2019s decision to drop out and endorse former Democratic Sen. Mark Begich in the final weeks of the campaign has scrambled the race. But Democrats have longer-shot opportunities, too, in New Hampshire and Oklahoma.\n\nOf the 50 U.S. governors, 33 are Republicans. If it\u2019s a bad night for the GOP, that number could slip to fewer than 25. But many races remain tight going into Election Day.", "Arizona Rep.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), have come to Arizona for Sinema fundraisers, according to invitations viewed by POLITICO.\n\nWhile McSally faced her own primary-season challenge to corral GOP support, Sinema has encountered some grumbling on the left about whether she\u2019s progressive enough to capture the state\u2019s Democratic base.\n\n\u201cI know some people who are very, very left-leaning \u2014 they\u2019re not necessarily as happy with what she\u2019s voted on before,\u201d Monica Pimentel, the Democratic chairwoman of a state legislative district, said during the party\u2019s weekend canvassing event. \u201cBut I think that she\u2019s also pulling in the moderate Republicans.\u201d\n\nJustin Unga, Arizona state director for the LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, said that he\u2019s \u201cnot personally concerned about\u201d Sinema\u2019s shift to the right in the House.\n\n\u201cShe wants to represent the entire electorate, and the only way she can do that is by working with the other side of the aisle,\u201d Unga said.\n\nDespite the race\u2019s continued closeness after multiple hits on Sinema, Republicans haven\u2019t given up the battle to define her as too liberal. Arizona GOP Chairman Jonathan Lines described her in a Friday interview as \u201ca progressive liberal masquerading as a moderate.\u201d\n\nWhat Sinema may not be \u2014 even as she sprinted towards the election in two ways, completing a half-marathon on Sunday \u2014 is as good a singer as McSally, who belted the national anthem before Arizona State University\u2019s homecoming football game on Saturday.\n\nSinema happened to be in the stadium for her opponent's rendition. The Democrat flashed the famed hand signal of her alma mater ASU before calling the pregame coin toss. And the home team won.\n\nJames Arkin contributed to this report.\n\n", "poster=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/834/1155968404_5857957619001_5857951898001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true Elections 'Trump has hijacked the election': House Republicans in panic mode Worries deepen that Trump's charged immigration rhetoric will cost the GOP more seats.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan got President Donald Trump on the phone Sunday for one final plea on behalf of anxious Republicans: Please, please talk up the booming economy in the final hours before Election Day.\n\nBut Trump, unsurprisingly, had another issue on his mind. He boasted to Ryan that his focus on immigration has fired up the base, according to a source familiar with the call.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTwo days out from an expected Democratic takeover of the House, Republicans focused on the chamber were profoundly worried that Trump\u2019s obsession with all things immigration would exacerbate their losses. Many of these same Republicans welcomed Trump\u2019s initial talk about the migrant caravan and border security two weeks ago, hoping it would gin up the GOP base in some at-risk, Republican-held districts.\n\nBut they now fear Trump went overboard \u2014 and that it could cost them dearly in key suburban districts, from Illinois to Texas. Many of them have cringed at Trump\u2019s threats to unilaterally end birthright citizenship, as well as his recent racially tinged ad suggesting that immigrants are police killers. The president's drumbeat, they say, is drowning out news any incumbent president would be negligent not to dwell on: that the economy added a quarter-million jobs last quarter, and unemployment is below 4 percent.\n\n\u201cTrump has hijacked the election,\u201d one senior House Republican aide said of Trump's focus on immigration. \u201cThis is not what we expected the final weeks of the election to focus on.\u201d\n\nThe disagreement highlights the tug-of-war over strategy that\u2019s been dogging the GOP all year: Should Republicans prioritize turning out Trump backers, or appeal to suburban swing voters? The party has diverged according to the chamber: Senate Republicans seeking to grow their majorities in rural, red states by toppling incumbent Democrats have mostly welcomed Trump's red-meat approach; House Republicans whose survival hinges on the suburbs have privately griped and tried to change the subject.\n\nThe different landscapes have created dual GOP campaign messages. Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Whip Steve Scalise and the National Republican Congressional Committee have made their closing argument about the economy, while the man with the bully pulpit suggested a few days ago that the military might shoot migrants who throw rocks.\n\nTrump has even publicly scoffed at GOP suggestions that he focus on the economy in the final days, though he did talk about the latest jobs report at rallies this weekend.\n\n\u201cWe can talk about the economy, but the fact is, we know how well we're doing with the economy and we have to solve problems,\u201d Trump said at an event in Florida on Friday, hitting back at criticism that he\u2019s ignoring his party\u2019s biggest asset.\n\nHe promptly latched onto his topic du jour: \u201cDemocrats are openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our sovereignty, overrun our borders and destroy our nation. In so many ways. We can't let it happen.\"\n\nThe heightened concerns foreshadow the blame game that will undoubtedly commence if Republicans lose the House on Tuesday. Trump has made clear he\u2019ll take little to no responsibility, insisting in recent days that he \u201ccan\u2019t go everywhere\u201d to save House candidates.\n\nIndeed, some House Republicans say privately that they feel abandoned, as if Trump has given up on them \u2014 the likely losers \u2014 in order to focus on the Senate. Rubbing salt in the wound, they feel Trump's message to help Senate Republicans in rural, red states is a direct threat to the House GOP's cause in suburban areas.\n\n\u201cHis homing in on this message is going to cost us seats,\u201d said one senior House GOP campaign source. \u201cThe people we need to win in these swing districts that will determine the majority \u2014 it\u2019s not the Trump base. It\u2019s suburban women, or people who voted for [Hillary] Clinton, or people who are not hard Trump voters.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/1126/1155968404_5857425402001_5857421155001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nIn Orange County, Calif., a former conservative bastion once known as Reagan Country, Democratic candidate Harley Rouda said Trump\u2019s heated immigration rhetoric has turned off moderate voters. Rouda, who\u2019s now in a neck-and-neck battle to defeat GOP incumbent Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, said \u201cwe are seeing these people coming into our campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with moderate Republicans and independents is an increasing frustration with the president of the United States, pitting Americans against Americans \u2014 trying to divide us instead of uniting us,\u2019\u2019 he said at his Costa Mesa campaign headquarters on Sunday.\n\nSouthern California is far from an outlier, according to several Republicans involved in House campaigns. Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric could be costly for a pair of suburban Texas Republicans who\u2019d seen improvements in their polling numbers two weeks ago, but who are once again struggling: Reps. Pete Sessions and John Culberson. These sources said it has also hurt Rep. Peter Roskam in Illinois, whose Chicago-area campaign message has focused on the economy in the final days of the election.\n\nRepublicans in districts with large Hispanic populations are also on high alert: Republican Rep. David Valadao of California\u2019s Central Valley has long been favored to win reelection. But there\u2019s a newfound fear that Trump\u2019s rhetoric toward immigrants will motivate more Latino voters to turn out against the incumbent.\n\nDitto for Rep. Jeff Denham, whose neighboring California district also has a large Hispanic population.\n\n\u201cTalking about immigration and birthright citizenship and the caravan \u2014 that doesn\u2019t help Jeff Denham,\" the senior GOP campaign source said.\n\nNot all Republicans feel this way. Some conservatives and more moderate members hope immigration will motivate their base. Trump's approval rating remains in the 40s, they note, higher than it had been over the summer. And the Democrats' 7-point lead in the generic congressional ballot, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll Sunday, was notably smaller than the double-digit lead the party previously held.\n\nMost Senate Republican candidates aren't backing away from Trump\u2019s immigration messaging. In Arizona, a border state where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema's more centrist record on immigration could help her snag a GOP-held seat on Tuesday, Republicans are reading from Trump\u2019s playbook.\n\nRepublican Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, who's poised to cruise to reelection, said Trump's rhetoric is ramping up \"the intensity of getting people out to vote.\"\n\n\"The other side is angry, they\u2019re energized, and they\u2019re actually showing some signs of being organized,\" Ducey said after joining Sinema's opponent, Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), for a rally at a pancake breakfast in rural Prescott. McSally said her closing message includes a major pitch on border security, though she has stopped short of fully endorsing Trump's call to limit the constitutional guarantee of citizenship.\n\nIn a few rare cases, House Republicans have felt the need to publicly rebuke Trump\u2019s hard-line talk. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a vulnerable Miami Republican, has taken to TV and Twitter in recent days to push back on Trump\u2019s immigration comments.\n\n\u201cBirthright citizenship is protected by the Constitution, so no @realDonaldTrump you can\u2019t end it by executive order,\u201d Curbelo tweeted right after Trump floated the idea.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/3930/1155968404_5856543053001_5856538663001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story. But Republican National Committee Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel defended Trump\u2019s controversial immigration ad on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe ad is highlighting the fact that one individual got through the cracks and killed cops. That should make every American upset, and we need to fix our immigration system. And the president's leading the way,\u201d she said when pressed about GOP concerns over Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric.\n\nNotably, however, it was the job numbers that McDaniel listed first in her opening pitch for why Republicans might keep the House.\n\n\u201cIt's about the results, and we just saw on Friday,\" she said. \"The great job numbers.\"", "Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp implored Georgians to head to the polls to help President Donald Trump \u201ccontinue to make American great again.\u201d | John Bazemore/AP Photo Elections At Georgia rally for Kemp, Trump keeps national focus\n\nPresident Donald Trump took the stage in Macon, Ga., on Sunday to rally Georgians on behalf of gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, echoing recent appearances by imploring voters to cast their ballots in support of Republicans across the country while hitting his usual campaign-trail talking points along the way.\n\nThroughout the nearly 80-minute event , the latest in a series of rallies to support candidates nationwide, Trump touched on an approaching caravan of Central American migrants, recent tax reform, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Russia, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and many other matters, often striking tones reminiscent of his presidential campaign.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBetween chants of \u201clock her up,\u201d \u201cU.S.A\u201d and other refrains common in his 2016 rallies, the president expressed optimism that Kemp would win the election Tuesday, touting his merits while deriding his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, as one of the \u201cmost extreme, far-left politicians in the entire country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn just two days, the people of Georgia are going to elect Brian Kemp as your next governor,\u201d Trump told a raucous crowd gathered in a hangar at Middle Georgia Regional Airport. \u201cTo protect your jobs, defend the borders, fight for your values and continue to make America great again.\u201d\n\nKemp, the Georgia secretary of state, himself spoke for less than 10 minutes, first thanking the president for the administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Michael and other assistance before also imploring Georgians to head to the polls to help Trump \u201ccontinue to make American great again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president needs some help at the state level from time to time,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cGet the vote out.\u201d\n\nKemp and Abrams, a former state legislator who is black, have been locked in a bitter and close campaign, with questions of race at the forefront and the issues of voting rights and integrity playing a central role. Kemp\u2019s job has put him in the position of overseeing an election in which he\u2019s competing, and his office has faced questions about putting African-American voter registrations on hold. On Sunday, Kemp\u2019s office announced that it had opened an investigation into the state Democratic Party after what is called \u201ca failed attempt to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system.\u201d\n\nThe party responded by calling the move a \u201cpolitical stunt,\u201d and Abrams criticized Kemp by calling the announcement a \u201cdesperate attempt on the part of my opponent to distract people from the fact that two different federal judges found him derelict in his duties.\u201d\n\nAt the rally, Trump spent most of his time onstage urging his supporters to turn out to vote Tuesday. He said the possibility of a Democratic \u201cblue wave\u201d seemed to be fading, \u201cbut you better get out and vote, otherwise I\u2019m going to look very bad with this statement.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia gubernatorial contest is a critical one, Trump said.\n\n\u201cI am here for Brian because the governor of Georgia means so much to our country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo you got to get out there.\u201d\n\nHowever, he focused much more on the significance of the midterms as a whole, calling them \u201cnot as important as \u201916, but right up there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important elections of our lifetime,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a very important election.\u201d\n\nThe election is \u201cabout jobs and safety,\u201d the president declared. Should Democrats \u2014 whom he called the \u201cradical resistance\u201d \u2014 take power, \u201cthey will move immediately to reverse America's progress and to eradicate all of the gains that we made.\u201d\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

They will \u201cimpose socialism and totally erase America's borders,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cRepublicans produce jobs, Democrats produce mobs,\u201d the president said to boos. \u201cYou have heard that! You have seen it! You have seen it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want more crime and more caravans, vote Democrat, it\u2019s simple. If you want strong voters and safe communities, vote Republican.\u201d\n\nWhen he did discuss Kemp, Trump steered clear of specifics, instead keeping the focus on broad topics like jobs, health care and education.\n\n\u201cBrian Kemp is an incredible fighter and a tireless champion for the people and for the values of Georgia,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe will keep your jobs and wages rising, which is what\u2019s happening. He will provide great schools and health care for your loved ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he will keep your families safe. So important.\u201d\n\nThe president also described Kemp as an advocate for the military, outlining his support for veterans throughout the state and beyond.\n\n\u201cBrian will always stand behind our military, and he has,\u201d the president said to cheers. \u201cHe has always stood by our military.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loves our vets,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cHe talks to me about the vets. He talks to me about the vets a lot. Sometimes I say \u2014 \u2018Brian. We gotta talk about another subject. Please, Brian.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnlike Abrams, Kemp will \u201cnever let anything bad happen to our Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBelieve me, [it] is under siege,\u201d he went on.\n\n\u201cIf Stacey Abrams gets in, your Second Amendment is gone,\u201d Trump said to boos. \u201cStacey and her friends will get rid of it: \u2018Please, give us all guns right now.\u2019\u201d\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Abrams told CNN that \u201cwhat I fundamentally believe is that we have to have common-sense, gun-safety legislation. I'm someone who supports the Second Amendment, who knows how to shoot, who knows how to hunt, but I believe that our responsibility is to make sure that the most vulnerable in our society do not face those who are irresponsible with their weapon.\u201c\n\nTrump also hit Abrams on other hot-button issues.\n\n\u201cShe wants to raise your income tax very substantially,\" he said. \u201cShe supports a socialist takeover of health care, which means you will never be able to see your doctor just like the vets were never able to see their doctor.\u201d\n\nShe is also \u201cweak on crime, really weak on crime,\u201d Trump went on, pointing to her desire to end the death penalty and more. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you need.\u201d\n\nFormer University of Georgia head football coach Vince Dooley also appeared onstage briefly to endorse Kemp\u2019s candidacy.\n\nDaniel Strauss contributed to this report."]
