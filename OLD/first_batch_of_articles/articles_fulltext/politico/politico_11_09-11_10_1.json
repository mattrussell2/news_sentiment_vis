Carlson\u201d stemming from an incident at a Virginia restaurant.\n\nThe attorney, who is exploring a 2020 presidential run and rose to national prominence by representing porn star Stormy Daniels against President Donald Trump, posted video on his Twitter account Saturday showing Carlson in a verbal altercation at a country club and asks for help in identifying other people involved in the incident.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCarlson, in a lengthy statement provided through Fox News, said the incident began when a man at the club last month verbally harassed his teenage daughter on her way back from a bathroom and called her a \u201cwhore\u201d and \u201cc---.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that his son then confronted the man and threw wine at him. But Carlson maintains neither he nor his son assaulted the man involved. Avenatti disputed that account, saying it\u2019s an \u201cabsolute lie.\u201d\n\nThe video, caught on another patron\u2019s cellphone, captures part of an argument involving Carlson and a man seated at the bar, whom Avenatti describes in the tweet as a \u201cgay Latino immigrant.\u201d Only a portion of the video was released.\n\n\u201cGuys. Guys, get the f--- out of here,\u201d Carlson, who is seen standing near the bar, can be heard saying. An individual in the video can be seen grabbing a man by the collar. That\u2019s when another person intercedes: \u201cHey. Hey! \u2026 There\u2019s no excuse for violence.\u201d Another person interjects, asking: \u201cDid you see what he did?\u201d\n\n1/2 - We are investigating an alleged assault on a gay latino immigrant committed by T.

Link to a portion of the incident:https://t.co/QcbCRHrplP \u2014 Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) November 10, 2018\n\nAvenatti told POLITICO he is representing the man who was grabbed by the collar, describing him as the \u201cvictim\u201d in the incident.\n\n\u201cWe are attempting to locate additional witnesses and to identify those depicted in the video. In particular, we need assistance identifying the balding man that grabs the man seated at the bar. We anticipate charges being filed,\u201d Avenatti wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnyone with knowledge, pls contact us.\u201d\n\nIn another Tweet, Avenatti added: \u201cWe are investigating an alleged assault on a gay latino immigrant committed by T. Carlson and/or members of his inner circle at a club in VA in Oct. It likely includes underage drinking in violation of VA law.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released by a spokeswoman for Fox News, Carlson said the incident depicted in the video took place on Oct. 13 at the Farmington Country Club in Charlottesville, Va., where he was having dinner with two of his children.\n\n\u201cToward the end of the meal, my 19-year-old daughter went to the bathroom with a friend,\u201d Carlson said in the statement. \u201cOn their way back through the bar, a middle aged man stopped my daughter and asked if she was sitting with Tucker Carlson. My daughter had never seen the man before. She answered: \u2018That\u2019s my dad,\u2019 and pointed to me. The man responded, \u2018Are you Tucker\u2019s whore?\u2019 He then called her a \u2018f---ing c---.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarlson continued: \u201cMy daughter returned to the table in tears. She soon left the table and the club. My son, who is also a student, went into the bar to confront the man. I followed. My son asked the man if he\u2019d called his sister a \u2018whore\u2019 and a \u2018c---.\u2019 The man admitted he had, and again become profane. My son threw a glass of red wine in the man\u2019s face and told him to leave the bar, which he soon did.\u201d\n\nCarlson said he detailed the incident to country club\u2019s management, and the club revoked the man\u2019s membership last week following an investigation.\n\n\u201cI love my children. It took enormous self-control not to beat the man with a chair, which is what I wanted to do,\u201d Carlson said in the statement. \u201cI think any father can understand the overwhelming rage and shock that I felt seeing my teenage daughter attacked by a stranger. But I restrained myself. I did not assault this man, and neither did my son. That is a lie. Nor did I know the man was gay or Latino, not that it would have mattered. What happened on October 13 has nothing to do with identity politics. It was a grotesque violation of decency.

We as a nation have become far too intolerant of different points of view,\" said Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and President Jay Wallace. \"Recent events across our country clearly highlight the need for a more civil, respectful, and inclusive national conversation.\"\n\nCarlson in March remarked on his show that \u201cno nation, no society has ever changed this much this fast\u201d and said America\u2019s shifting demographic landscape was \u201cmore change than human beings are designed to digest.\u201d\n\nAnd in September, Carlson asked on-air, \u201cHow, precisely, is diversity our strength?\u201d He added: \u201cCan you think, for example, of other institutions such as, I don\u2019t know, marriage or military units in which the less people have in common, the more cohesive they are? Do you get along better with your neighbors or your coworkers if you can\u2019t understand each other or share no common values?\u201d\n\nAvenatti has drawn his own criticism of late. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley referred the attorney and his client Julie Swetnick to the Department of Justice for investigation, accusing them of making false statements against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a sexual misconduct investigation. Avenatti also drew fire after he was recently quoted in Time saying that the Democrat to run against Trump in 2020 better be a white male. Avenatti said the remark was taken out of context.", "\u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is stop counting votes because we don\u2019t like the outcome,\u201d said Democratic Florida gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum. | Steve Cannon/AP Photo Gillum rescinds concession in Florida governor\u2019s race\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Florida\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum said he has rescinded the concession he gave election night and looks forward to the machine recount of millions of ballots in his race against GOP opponent Ron DeSantis.\n\n\u201cI am replacing my words of concession in an unapologetic call that we count every vote,\u201d Gillum said Saturday at a press conference.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGillum blasted claims of fraud made by President Donald Trump, Gov.

I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\nGillum\u2019s decision puts the Florida governor\u2019s race back into play as recounts began Saturday in that race and the state\u2019s Senate race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is stop counting votes because we don\u2019t like the outcome,\u201d Gillum said.\n\nGillum trailed DeSantis by .41 percent of the vote as of this afternoon, just three hours after county elections supervisors provided unofficial vote counts to Secretary of State Ken Detzner. The razor thin difference in Gillum\u2019s race triggered a machine recount under state law of the roughly 8.2 million votes cast in the race.\n\nGilum said votes are still being counted.\n\n\u201cEvery vote will be counted,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI have got to imagine that if the shoe were on the other foot of my opponents, not one of them would stop until the votes are counted.\u201d\n\nGillum spoke from his campaign headquarters in Tallahassee flanked by his lawyer, Barry Richard. He said the Legislature set the .5 percent threshold for machine recounts because at that margin, there\u2019s a chance the race could change.\n\n\u201cI will tell you that the Legislature, when they divided these laws made the determination that the margins they set, there was a realistic chance,\u201d said Richard, who represented George W. Bush in the historic 2000 recount against Democrat Al Gore.\n\nDetzner had also called for machine recounts in the races for U.S. Senate and state Commissioner of Agriculture. Ongoing counts of provisional ballots filed for the Tuesday midterm election took days to process in a handful of counties across the state. The race for governor and U.S. Senate drew attention to ongoing counts in Broward and Palm Beach counties, which are heavily populated and rich with registered Democrats.\n\nScott took part in a public records lawsuit filed earlier this week that led Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes and her Palm Beach County counterpart Susan Bucher to turn over provisional ballots for review.\n\nGillum had conceded in his race to DeSantis on Election night. But the count of provisional ballots whittled DeSantis\u2019 lead from just over one 1 percentage point.", "Rep.

Recounts were also ordered in three legislative races.\n\nExpected since Election Day, the recounts herald a new and bitter partisan chapter in the political history of Florida \u2014 which became the ultimate but dysfunctional swing state 18 years ago when it decided the presidency by 537 votes \u2014 as Republicans leveled unfounded charges of voter fraud while Democrats revived their decades-old chant to count every vote.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOnce again, a losing candidate withdrew his concession. And again South Florida elections supervisors find themselves under the national spotlight\u2019s glare as they slowly tally votes and face credible accusations of mismanagement \u2014 with Broward County including 22 \u201cillegal\u201d ballots that should not have been counted and a judge rebuking Palm Beach County over the way it duplicated at least 650 ballots that were damaged when the originals were destroyed.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum on Saturday rescinded his concession to Republican Ron DeSantis in that contest.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\" Gillum said at a news conference. \"What has also changed since election night have been the chorus of voices \u2014 from the President of the United States, the junior senator of the state of Florida, and the governor of the state of Florida \u2014 a chorus calling for the ending of the counting in this process.\"\n\nGillum is down nearly 34,000 votes, and his climb remains steep. Underscoring the huge task at hand is the fact that the largest vote swing in a gubernatorial recount was 2,208 votes, during Washington state\u2019s 2004 gubernatorial race, according to the FairVote Research Project.\n\nDeSantis focused on the vote gap that remains between him and Gillum, breaking days of silence in a one-minute video again declaring victory and never mentioning the world \u201crecount.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the election behind us, it\u2019s now time to come together as a state as we prepare to serve all Floridians,\u201d DeSantis said in the video.\n\nAs in 2000, the lack of clarity in state law acts as a full-employment act for lawyers from both parties waging war in courthouses instead of on the campaign trail. In Leon County, for example, which was getting very little statewide attention as the recount began, at least five attorneys for both campaigns were among those in attendance as a meeting of the Leon County Canvassing Board officially kicked off at 2 p.m Saturday.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to do this again,\u201d said a weary Mark Herron, one of Florida\u2019s top election-law lawyers, who was part of former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s recount team in 2000 vs. George W. Bush. \u201cI just don\u2019t wanna.\u201d\n\nUnder state law, the races and winners are supposed to be certified in 10 days, on Nov. 20, but it\u2019s unclear how long the recounts and court fights will take.\n\nFor all the similarities between 2000 and today, there are stark differences.\n\nIn Bush vs. Gore, the ultra-slim margin made the ultimate outcome impossible to predict. But in today\u2019s races for U.S. Senate, governor and agriculture commissioner, the margins for all the front-runners are large enough to make the outcome favor them far more after the end of the recounts, which are triggered under Florida law when the margin in a race hits 0.5 percentage points.\n\nOf the three statewide races, DeSantis had the biggest lead, 0.41 percentage points, or 33,684 votes, as of noon Saturday, when the 67 county election supervisors in the state were required to submit unofficial results to the state.\n\nIn the Senate race, Republican Gov. Rick Scott led Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by 0.15 percentage points, or 12,562 votes. And in the race for agriculture commissioner, Democrat Nikki Fried was ahead of Republican Matt Caldwell by the smallest amount, 0.07 percent.\n\nIf the margins remain below 0.25 percent in the races for Senate and agriculture commissioner, they\u2019ll be subject to a manual recount. In that process, the ballots that show either no votes (called undervotes) or multiple votes (overvotes) are inspected by hand to determine voter intent.\n\nMarc Elias, a well-known Democratic election law attorney working for Nelson, maintained his overwhelming optimism during a conference call with reporters after the recount began.\n\n\u201cI expect to see that margin to evaporate entirely and for Sen. Nelson to take a small lead,\u201d Elias said.\n\nArmed with zero evidence, Scott has worked to stoke fears of \u201crampant [voter] fraud.\u201d On Thursday, he called on state law enforcement to investigate both the Broward County and Palm Beach County election offices, both of which are playing a key role in counting votes in his race. The following day, law enforcement confirmed there was no evidence of voter fraud and there was no active investigation.\n\nIn addition, Scott\u2019s administration sent election monitors to Broward County after Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes was found to have violated state and federal law for illegally destroying ballots in during the 2016 election cycle. Those monitors have also reported no fraud.\n\nThe laws governing Florida recounts were overhauled following the 2000 elections meltdown, characterized by stop-and-start recounts and multiple lawsuits that finally ended with the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBut one outstanding legal wrinkle remained before Saturday\u2019s noon deadline approached: Could ballots counted after the deadline be counted toward the unofficial results that were already due, or would they not count at all? Democrats wanted them counted. Republicans were drafting court motions to fight that.\n\nAs was the case all week, the controversy primarily revolved around Democrat-dominated Broward County, where Snipes has been under fire since the day after the election. The county sent its unofficial results to the state but then kept counting ballots. Snipes\u2019 office gave out conflicting information about what was supposed to be counted.\n\nThe Miami Herald reported that Snipes included 22 ballots in the total that were cast by voters whose signature did not match the signature on file. Ballots with mismatched signatures are considered \u201cillegal\u201d under state law, which is designed to stop voter fraud.\n\nBut Snipes included them anyway in a batch of 205 provisional ballots. Once the votes were mixed together, the anonymous votes couldn\u2019t be determined. So they were just included, Snipes told the paper, because \u201cit seems unfair to me to disenfranchise 205 voters at the expense of a small number.\u201d\n\nThe day before, a court forced Snipes to provide Scott\u2019s campaign data about who voted in the election and the remaining votes to be counted \u2014 information she should have had at her ready disposal and easily rendered under Florida public records law.\n\nRepublicans charged that Snipes also failed to follow a state law requiring results to be updated every 45 minutes. Instead, tens of thousands of votes would be dumped into the state system \u2014 sometimes late at night \u2014 causing the margins in the major races to shrink as the ballots from the Democrat-heavy county poured in.\n\nHeading into the election, Snipes\u2019 office was being monitored by Scott administration officials after she lost a May court case for the unlawful destruction of ballots. Marring her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 further, around the same time Snipes lost another court case over the way she privately handled absentee ballots outside the view of the county canvassing board, a three-member panel that meets in public to handle ballot controversies and certify local elections.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, Election Supervisor Susan Bucher also was slow to report results and continued counting ballots on Saturday. She was sued by the Scott campaign for her office\u2019s decision to have staff duplicate at least 650 damaged ballots. The law says the ballots should go first to the county\u2019s canvassing board.\n\n\u201cThe language [of the law] is unambiguous that it is for the canvassing board to make the determination,\u201d Circuit Court Judge Krista Marx on Saturday scolded Bucher, whom she also chastised for blowing a court-imposed deadline. \u201cIt\u2019s my opinion zip-a-dee-doo-dah has been done to comply,\u201d the judge said.\n\nBucher, in turn, picked a fight with the press and tried to block cameras from recording the canvassing board. She also attacked President Donald Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Scott for their claims that the process was marked by fraud or Democrats trying to \u201csteal\u201d the election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate that some of the highest elected officials in our country are trying to disrupt our democracy because they don\u2019t like the demographics of our voters,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI would wish that they would allow us to continue to count the ballots. We're just doing our job in accordance with law.\u201d\n\nRubio pointed out that his home county, Miami-Dade, is the largest in the state \u2014 ahead of second-largest Broward to the north and third-largest Palm Beach above it in South Florida \u2014 and yet it was able to finish its vote counting without the same controversies and slow results.\n\nAnother lawsuit, meanwhile, looms: Nelson\u2019s campaign has sued Scott\u2019s secretary of state over what it says is a capricious standard for verifying voter signatures on absentee and provisional ballots. The campaign wants all the ballots with mismatched signatures to count; Scott\u2019s campaign calls that an invitation for fraud.\n\nNelson and Gillum\u2019s campaigns want so many votes to count that they even objected when Bucher rejected a ballot that was being reviewed from a person who was not a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u201cFor them, illegally-cast votes are just as good as legally-cast votes, as long as they voted for Democrats,\u201d Scott campaign spokesman Chris Hartline said on Twitter.\n\nWhen the recount was announced, the trailing candidates had the opportunity to quit and hand the victory to their opponent. Gillum had announced Election Day that he was conceding, but that was before all the final votes were added to the total.\n\nIn at least three cases in Broward County, some elections-office boxes labeled as if they had ballots in them were left behind in some polling stations, raising suspicions about chain of custody and incomplete vote tallies.\n\nOutside the elections office in Broward and Palm Beach counties, demonstrators from both parties jeered at each other and hurled insults, an eerie echo of the divided crowds in 2000. Democrats chanted \u201cCount every vote!\u201d Republicans, speaking of Bucher and Snipes, chanted back: \u201cLock her up!\u201d\n\nIn Broward, Republicans also wondered about newly \u201cfound\u201d votes as they saw moving trucks backing up into the loading dock at the Lauderhill elections office. Andrew Pollack, a Republican resident of Broward County and father of one of the students murdered during the school shooting in Parkland this year, shot video of the moving trucks and railed against Snipes as an incompetent.\n\n\u201cIf I went bowling,\u201d Pollack said, \u201cshe probably couldn\u2019t keep score.\u201d", "A crowd protests outside the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office on Friday, Nov. 9, 2018, in Lauderhill, Fla. | Joe Skipper/AP Photo Rick Scott's monitors agree with state cops: No Florida voter fraud\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Gov.

Because those are Democratic-leaning counties, the new votes have benefited Democratic candidates, narrowing leads held by Scott in the Senate race and Republican Ron DeSantis in the governor\u2019s race. Some have suggested fraud might have caused the vote tallies to grow, but state law allows local election officials to count votes until noon on Saturday. A recount is set to begin Saturday.\n\nThe unprecedented Scott request amounts to a sitting governor asking state law enforcement to investigate local election officials involved in counting ballots for a race in which he is a candidate.\n\nAdditional Department of State staff were sent to Broward County after a federal judge found in May that the county\u2019s Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes violated state and federal law by destroying ballots in Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultzs 2016 re-election bid. At that time, Scott, who has the authority to remove Snipes from office, said the state would be sending additional election monitors to Broward County for the 2018 election.\n\nThe department sent two staffers to Broward County starting Nov. 6. Revell, the DOS spokeswoman, not only said those monitors saw no signs of fraud on the ground, but have not yet produced any work product or report related to their observations.\n\n\u201cThere are no reports from the observers,\u201d Revell said.\n\nThe staffers on the ground, who Revell has not identified despite questions from POLITICO, were given a number of tasks and will be on the ground in Broward County until the election is certified, a process that could go on long after Election Day.\n\n\u201cTwo staff members from the Division of Elections were assigned as observers to monitor the administration of the election, including visiting polling locations throughout the day as needed and observing preparation of the voting equipment and procedures for the election,\u201d Revell said.", "Sheldon and Miriam Adelson in recent months have emerged as the Republican Party\u2019s biggest financial backers. | Patrick Semansky, File/AP Photo White House Wife of GOP megadonor to receive Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nPresident Donald Trump is set to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2014 the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor \u2014 to the wife of one of the Republican Party\u2019s most prominent patrons, the White House announced Saturday.\n\nMiriam Adelson will receive the medal along with six other \u201cdistinguished individuals\u201d at a ceremony on Friday, the White House said.

By a White House and Washington mired in special interest politics. But we can take our country back with a Democratic agenda for the people. That means lowering health-care costs.

Whitaker on CNN in the summer of 2017 and liked what he saw \u2014 a partisan defender who insisted there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. So that July, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, interviewed Mr. Whitaker about joining the president\u2019s team as a legal attack dog against the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. ...\n\n\u201cPeople close to Mr. Trump believe that he sent Mr. Whitaker to the department in part to limit the fallout from the Mueller investigation, one presidential adviser said. White House aides and other people close to Mr. Trump anticipate that Mr. Whitaker will rein in any report summarizing Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and will not allow the president to be subpoenaed.\u201d NYT\n\n-- ET TU, WHITAKER? -- \u201cSessions realized too late that Whitaker was auditioning for his job,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Evan Perez, Laura Jarrett and Ariane de Vogue: \u201cWhen things were particularly bad between President Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general\u2019s chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, would attend White House meetings in his place.\n\n\u201cBut Sessions did not know that Whitaker at the same time was angling for a promotion.

Leonnig and Ros Helderman: \u201cFederal investigators last year looked into whether Matthew G. Whitaker, as an advisory board member of a Miami patent company accused of fraud by customers, played a role in trying to help the company silence critics by threatening legal action, according to two people with knowledge of the inquiry. Whitaker ... occasionally served as an outside legal adviser to the company, World Patent Marketing, writing a series of letters on its behalf, according to people familiar with his role.\n\n\u201cBut he rebuffed an October 2017 subpoena from the Federal Trade Commission seeking his records related to the company, according to two people with knowledge of the case. The FTC alleged in a 2017 complaint that the company bilked customers with fraudulent promises that it would help them market their invention. The FBI has also investigated World Patent Marketing, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.\u201d WaPo\n\nTRUMP SHIFTS TO STRONGLY BACK WHITAKER at 11:52 p.m.: \u201cMatthew G.

Their vulnerable incumbents were free to ignore liberal orthodoxy over the past two years, but at least three red-state Democrats still went down hard in the midterms. And as 2020 looms, the party faces a steep challenge in clawing back to the Senate majority. \u2026\n\n\u201cSchumer stayed characteristically sunny this week in his first post-election chat with reporters. He blasted Trump for portraying the GOP\u2019s Senate pickups as offsetting its House losses, but made no new vows to amp up policy fights with the president. And the New York Democrat insisted his party did \u2018much better than expected,\u2019 despite having suggested in June that they could pull off a long-shot takeover of the upper chamber.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cDemocrats Plan to Pursue Most Aggressive Gun-Control Legislation in Decades,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Reid J.

While Florida Gov. Rick Scott has lashed out at election officials over the vote counting in his state, McSally has been largely silent. Top officials with the White House and [RNC], who\u2019ve been prodding the McSally campaign to amp up its efforts, have expressed frustration that the Arizona congresswoman hasn\u2019t tried to drive a message that there\u2019s something amiss with the vote count.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday evening, senior Republicans joined the McSally campaign for a conference call to discuss the state of play. On the call, Justin Clark, the White House director of public liaison, and Mike Roman, a veteran opposition researcher who is working with the RNC, pressed the McSally campaign on what was being done.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FLORIDA -- \u201cNelson files lawsuit to count more votes; Scott alleges fraud,\u201d by Marc Caputo in Miami: \u201cSen.

What can you do to help my campaign? he asked, according to people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Pecker, chief executive of American Media Inc., offered to use his National Enquirer tabloid to buy the silence of women if they tried to publicize alleged sexual encounters with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cLess than a year later, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Pecker to quash the story of a former Playboy model who said they\u2019d had an affair. Mr. Pecker\u2019s company soon paid $150,000 to the model, Karen McDougal, to keep her from speaking publicly about it. Mr. Trump later thanked Mr. Pecker for the assistance. The Trump Tower meeting and its aftermath are among several previously unreported instances in which Mr. Trump intervened directly to suppress stories about his alleged sexual encounters with women, according to interviews with three dozen people who have direct knowledge of the events or who have been briefed on them, as well as court papers, corporate records and other documents.\u201d WSJ\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA will be the special guest on a live taping of \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d with DAVID AXELROD on Nov. 20 in Chicago.

Right now the burden-sharing has been largely on the United States.\u201d\n\nHis comments came after Macron worked hard to subtly declare a truce between the two leaders. Trump had taken offense \u2014 and expressed so over Twitter late Friday night \u2014 over Macron\u2019s suggestion that the European Union needed its own army.\n\nStill, the relationship between the two leaders did not seem as warm Saturday as it did in past meetings when the two leaders mugged for the cameras, vigorously shook hands and patted each other on the back. Trump\u2019s only other trip to Paris as president occurred in July 2017, when he attended a huge military parade that delighted him so much that he sought his own at home.\n\nTrump\u2019s more distant posture to Macron has extended to U.S. foreign relations at-large lately, as Trump has played the role of the disruptor in chief. Trump has pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and the Iran deal. He\u2019s threatened tariffs on German cars and cozied up to the leaders of Russia and North Korea, all while upending international trade agreements and alliances with longtime U.S. friends including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, and Japan.\n\nAnd he has declined to assure allies that the U.S. will have their back, instead talking up a go-it-alone approach for the U.S. \u2014 a theme he\u2019s echoed in speeches in Poland and at the United Nations.\n\nTrump also received widespread criticism online on Saturday from foreign policy experts, war historians and former government officials for skipping a planned visit to a U.S. war cemetery outside of Paris, citing rainy weather, as other world leaders were photographed outside at various memorials paying their respects.\n\nNow, faced with the ongoing Russia investigation in the U.S. and an upcoming personnel shake-up with his White House staff and Cabinet, foreign policy experts believe the president could end up turning the U.S. more inward-facing than it\u2019s been in decades.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s fundamental challenge with foreign leaders now is that he has to convince them that the domestic turmoil in Washington will not further distract him from key international questions,\u201d said Jamie Fly, director of the Future of Geopolitics Program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States who served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush.\n\nFly expected the roughly 60 foreign leaders in town Sunday for the Armistice event to ask the president about any fall-out from the U.S. midterm elections and the way a divided government could influence foreign policy moves.\n\nWith Macron, Trump was expected to discuss the situation in Syria, threats posed by Iran, European security and potentially trade, according to a senior administration official.\n\nPrior to their private policy session, Trump invoked some of his favorite budget figures to talk up the U.S. military\u2019s might \u2014 another instance of attempting to project strength given the bevy of challenges he now faces at home.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019re rebuilding our military. We just had approved $716 billion. The year before that, we had $700 billion. So we\u2019re almost completely rebuilding our military with the latest and the greatest,\u201d Trump told reporters. (Numerous fact-checks have shown that Trump\u2019s figure does not accurately reflect actual military spending.)\n\nSo far, Trump has no plans to meet one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin while both are in Paris over the weekend. Trump has indicated the two instead will meet at the G-20 in Buenos Aires later this month.\n\nTrump\u2019s schedule does not leave much time for deep conversations with world leaders while he\u2019s in France.\n\nFor the rest of his trip, Trump and the First Lady are expected to dine with Macron and his wife Saturday evening at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. On Sunday, they will attend an Armistice Day celebration with roughly 60 other world leaders followed by a lunch.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, the president is scheduled to travel to the Suresnes American Cemetery on the outskirts of Paris, where American veterans from both World War I and World War II are buried. He departs for the U.S. Sunday night.\n\nThe largely commemorative trip gives Trump ample opportunities for photo-ops, without much time for hard questions from other world leaders or the press.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get the sense it is a highly substantive agenda, and it may be highly successful for the president,\u201d Fly added. \u201cMajor issues of disagreement likely will not come up, now that the Putin meeting has been postponed.\u201d", "Evan Vucci/AP Photo WHITE HOUSE Trump blames California forest policies for deadly wildfires\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday blamed \"mismanagement\" of California\u2019s forests for ongoing deadly wildfires, threatening to withhold federal payments after 25 people died in two separate blazes and evacuation orders were issued for some 250,000 state residents.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump earlier issued an emergency declaration providing federal funds to help firefighters.\n\nTrump has previously criticized management of California\u2019s forests, blaming the spread of wildfires and widespread drought on the state\u2019s water policy. Trump in August said California\u2019s \u201cbad environmental laws\u201d are a cause of wildfires. Experts have disputed those claims.\n\nThe Pasadena Fire Association hit back at the president's comments on Twitter later Saturday, writing: \"Mr. President, with all due respect, you are wrong. The fires in So. Cal are urban interface fires and have NOTHING to do with forest management. Come to SoCal and learn the facts & help the victims. Scott Austin, Pres IAFF 809. @IAFFNewsDesk.\"\n\nBrian Rice, the president of the California Professional Firefighters, said in a statement: \"The president\u2019s message attacking California and threatening to withhold aid to the victims of the cataclysmic fires is Ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning to those who are suffering as well as the men and women on the front lines.\"\n\nTrump later struck a more conciliatory tone, tweeting: \"More than 4,000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170,000 acres. Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic. God Bless them all.\n\n\"These California fires are expanding very, very quickly (in some cases 80-100 acres a minute). If people don\u2019t evacuate quickly, they risk being overtaken by the fire. Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials!\"\n\nOne of the wildfires this week incinerated most of the Northern California town of Paradise, killing at least 23 people and becoming the third deadliest fire in California's history, according to the Associated Press.\n\nA Southern California wildfire killed 2 and continued to burn homes as it ran toward the ocean, including in the celebrity enclave of Malibu, which officials ordered evacuated.", "Since Donald Trump\u2019s rise in 2015, calling his presidency Orwellian has been a kind of shibboleth among critics. After Trump\u2019s first week in January 2017, Adam Gopnik wrote in the New Yorker, \u201cre-reading Orwell, one is reminded of what Orwell got right about this kind of brute authoritarianism.\u201d That same month, when Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway defended the administration\u2019s \u201calternative facts,\u201d Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote that \u201cwe\u2019ve gone full Orwell.\u201d Shortly afterward, sales of 1984 surged.\n\nBut in one important respect, these commentators are missing something important. When it comes to language, Trump isn\u2019t the kind of person Orwell was worried about. In fact the plain-speaking president represents something closer to Orwell\u2019s imagined solution to a problem that consumed him, the use of public language to hide meaning. If you look at how Trump talks\u2014and the similar rhetoric in Britain around Brexit, and the broader populist wind across Europe\u2014it is proof that Orwell got some big things wrong when it comes to language\u2019s ability to protect us from politicians who would rather have us not know the truth.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf Orwell as a political thinker is known for one thing besides \u201cBig Brother,\u201d it\u2019s his celebrated 1946 essay \u201cPolitics and the English Language,\u201d in which he complained of leaders using language not to communicate, but to hide their intentions. \u201cA mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow,\u201d he wrote, \u201cblurring the outline and covering up all the details\u2026. When there is a gap between one\u2019s real and one\u2019s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink.\u201d\n\nOrwell was confident that simple language itself would be a defense against much of what was wrong with politics. Clarity would make it near impossible for leaders to say stupid and dishonest things, or to fall into lock-step dogma, without realizing that they were doing so\u2014and without exposing the speaker as a fraud or a villain. As he wrote in \u201cPolitics and the English Language\u201d: \u201cIf you simplify your English, you are freed from the worst follies of orthodoxy. You cannot speak any of the necessary dialects, and when you make a stupid remark its stupidity will be obvious, even to yourself.\u201d His famous six rules for writers, which close the essay, are instructions on how to strip one\u2019s words of such clutter.\n\nOrwell had witnessed the rise of the two great murderous -isms in Europe, fascism and communism. Both turned their violence on their own people with a ferocity that could not be put in plain language. As Orwell put it, a defender of Stalin\u2019s purges can\u2019t just come out and say \u201cI believe in killing off your opponents when you can get good results by doing so.\u201d The same might be said for Hitler\u2019s versch\u00e4rfte Vernehmung and Endl\u00f6sung, \u201csharpened interrogation\u201d and \u201cfinal solution,\u201d which in plain language are torture and mass murder.\n\nSince Orwell, it has become a common complaint among pundits and commentators that overblown or confusing language stacks the deck against ordinary citizens who just want to know what their government is up to. His notion that plain language will make awful politics unbearable is simple and appealing\u2014and largely wrong. Remember that for people to recognize a falsehood, they need to know the truth. Orwell assumes that once deception is stripped away, the truth will be plain. But populism, or at least the brand of populism represented by Trump and Brexit, proves that Orwell was wrong.\n\nThe year 2016 rocked Western politics. First, in June, Britain voted for Brexit: to leave the European Union, against the advice of the overwhelming majority of politicians, economists, academics, business leaders and elite journalists. Then, in November, America rejected a former secretary of state and senator, Hillary Clinton, for a political novice and a billionaire with a habit of saying appalling things, Donald Trump. In both cases, the experts misread the sentiment of a part of their country far away from the big cities where journalists tend to live and work.\n\nAnd in both cases, those angry voters, ready to vote for change of almost any kind, were seduced not by \u201ccuttlefish squirting out ink,\u201d but by politicians making it perfectly clear what they wanted and how they planned to get it. Without making a statement on whether these voting choices were right or wrong, both Brexit and Trump ran campaigns filled with lies\u2014lies in simple, bold language. When they lied, the lies were often perfectly clear to anyone who cared to learn the least bit about the facts. But either the lies were not recognized as such, or voters didn\u2019t care.\n\nFirst take Brexit. Its master slogan was simple: \u201cLet\u2019s take back control.\u201d Brussels, the metonym for the European Union, was an undemocratic weight on Britain\u2019s ancient freedoms, its democracy and the \u201cMother of All Parliaments,\u201d the legislature at Westminster. Brexit\u2019s\n\nproponents toured the country in a bus that featured the slogan \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350m a week. Let\u2019s fund the NHS [UK National Health Service] instead. Vote Leave.\u201d The \u00a3350m figure was fake; it was a net number that didn\u2019t take into account the money Britain got back from the EU. And no one on the Leave side had any serious interest in putting any big extra sums\u2014much less \u00a3350m a week\u2014into the health service. But when supporters of staying in the EU pointed this out, they were dismissed as \u201celites\u201d with no standing to talk about what the real British people\u2014sick of elites\u2014wanted. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the language on the side of the bus, which obeys all of Orwell\u2019s rules. The problem was voters\u2019 grasp of the facts, or their disregard for them.\n\nThe polite faces of the Leave campaign were Boris Johnson, who had just been the Conservative mayor of London, and Michael Gove, the former justice and education secretary. But its real powerhouse was Nigel Farage, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party.\n\nMainstream politicians dismissed Farage as a buffoon\u2014it is hard to find a politician more often photographed with a pint of beer and a cigarette in his hands. But that was part of his appeal. And so was his language\u2014as different from that of a polished politician as they come.\n\nIn a typical speech, he said:\n\nSo who are we? Who is the typical UKIP voter? I\u2019ll tell you something about the typical UKIP voter\u2014the typical UKIP voter doesn\u2019t exist. When I look at the audiences in those theaters there is a range of British society from all parts of the spectrum. Workers, employers, self-employed. Big businessmen, corner shop owners. Well off, comfortably off, struggling. Young as well as old. Not ideologues. Some left, some right, mostly in the middle. Some activists, some haven\u2019t voted for twenty years. One thing many have in common: they are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster. The spot-the-difference politicians. Desperate to fight the middle ground, but can\u2019t even find it. Focus groupies. The triangulators. The dog whistlers. The politicians who daren\u2019t say what they really mean. And that\u2019s why UKIP attracts this eclectic support. Because when we believe something\u2014we don\u2019t go \u201care you thinking what we\u2019re thinking?\u201d We say it out loud.\n\nThere are a few clich\u00e9s in there (\u201cfed up to the back teeth,\u201d \u201ccardboard cut-out\u201d). But by and large, this too is a text that follows Orwell\u2019s rules. It even reads a bit like Orwell: Its sentences are short, as are all of the words; about the fanciest words are \u201cspectrum,\u201d \u201ceclectic\u201d and \u201cideologue.\u201d And he ends with a macho declaration about political language itself, in the plainest possible English: \u201cwe say it out loud.\u201d\n\nWhat he wanted was perfectly clear, too. In the Brexit of his dreams, as Farage said in the same speech:\n\nWe get our money back.\n\nWe get our borders back.\n\nWe get our Parliament back.\n\nWe get our fisheries back.\n\nWe get our own seat on the bodies that actually run the world.\n\nWe get back the ability to strike free-trade deals.\n\n\u201cElites\u201d could cavil at the facts implied here. But the pounding, repetitive phrasing was perfectly clear and punishingly effective. Whatever the causes of the narrow victory for Brexit, obfuscating language was not it.\n\nThat same summer, Donald Trump was shifting into general-election mode in the United States, having wrapped up the Republican nomination for president. He had swept away more than a dozen Republican rivals who had tried to belittle him as a newcomer out of his depth. Something about his campaign generated an energy among his voters that none of his rivals could match. And much of it had to do with his speech. He loved to rib Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida who had raised huge sums for his campaign, as \u201clow energy.\u201d And he was; Bush seemed an owlish, slightly tired professor next to the shouting, staccato Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s style was successful precisely for being anything but that of a seasoned politician giving an elegant speech. He spoke almost entirely off the cuff:\n\nLook, having nuclear\u2014my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart. You know, if you\u2019re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I\u2019m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world. It\u2019s true! But when you\u2019re a conservative Republican they try\u2014oh, do they do a number\u2014that\u2019s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune. You know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we\u2019re a little disadvantaged. But you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me\u2014it would have been so easy, and it\u2019s not as important as these lives are. Nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power, and that was 35 years ago. He would explain the power of what\u2019s going to happen and he was right\u2014who would have thought? But when you look at what\u2019s going on with the four prisoners\u2014now it used to be three, now it\u2019s four\u2014but when it was three and even now, I would have said it\u2019s all in the messenger, fellas. And it is fellas because, you know, they don\u2019t, they haven\u2019t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it\u2019s gonna take them about another 150 years. But the Persians are great negotiators. The Iranians are great negotiators. So, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.\n\nUnedited transcripts like this rocketed around the internet, forwarded by voters alarmed that anyone could consider voting for a man who produced such a stream of non-sequiturs, the rhetorical equivalent of a bunch of beer cans, potato-chip bags and the odd shiny pool of oil floating down a filthy river. But the effect of passing these excerpts around was not what the people sharing them hoped. The chief result was to blind Trump\u2019s opponents to how effective he was.\n\nReal speech is full of starts and stops, non-sequiturs, ellipses and so on. For example, examine this linguistic 12-car pile-up.\n\nWe need to have a much more intentional explicit plan for NATO to engage with African countries and regional organizations, uh, not because the United States is not prepared to invest in security efforts in Africa, but rather to ensure that, uh, we are not perceived as trying to uh, dominate the continent. Rather we wanna make sure that we\u2019re prep-, uh, seen as, uh, a reliable partner, and there are some advantages to some European countries with historical ties, uh, being engaged, uh, in uh, and uh, in ha-, in, taking advantage of relationships. The francophile countries obviously is gonna to be able to do certain things better than we can, uh, and, uh, you know, one of, one of the, uh, things we, we wanna make sure of, though is that, uh, when, when the average African thinks about US, uh, engagement in Africa, I don\u2019t want them to think our only interest is avoiding terrorists from spilling out into, uh, the world stage.\n\nIt\u2019s an embarrassing mess: \u201cfrancophile\u201d substituted for \u201cfrancophone,\u201d subjects and verbs not matching up, sentences not ending properly, and one \u201cuh\u201d after the other. The speaker is Barack Obama. He was talking to the editor and the foreign editor of The Economist on Air Force One in 2014.\n\nAdapted from Talk on the Wild Side: Why Language Can't Be Tamed\n\nFor those passing around similar, unedited transcripts of Trump, the joke was on them. While he could maunder on and get off topic quite frequently, the unscripted and personal way he said nearly everything he said was mesmerizing to many voters who had never heard a politician talk like this.\n\nAnd these populists were not only successful with their style; they were clear about content, in blunt language meant to shock the audiences into thinking \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anyone say these things.\u201d Farage was explicit, saying that UKIP would not be cowed by taboo: \u201cWe say it out loud.\u201d\n\nTrump did the same, hardly hiding his plans. \u201cWe are going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.\u201d \u201cI would immediately start renegotiating our trade deals with Mexico, China, Japan and all of these countries that are just absolutely destroying us.\u201d \u201cI will get rid of gun-free zones on schools and \u2026 on military bases.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries.\u201d\n\nSay what you like, but Orwell\u2019s heavy snowfall of obscuring language is nowhere to be seen.\n\nSince Orwell\u2019s death, the nature of political speech has changed. In the 1940s, politicians still strove for an elevated register when they spoke in public. Beginning in the 1960s, they began aiming to look more authentic, of the people. On the Democratic side, young voters rejected their elders and tradition, while on the Republican side, Nixon turned the \u201csilent majority\u201d against intellectuals and the cultural elite. In both cases, the result was politicians aiming for a style that was immediate and real rather than polished and perfect. They didn\u2019t go all the way\u2014whether Obama or Bush, most aimed to keep some kind of dignity in their words. But demotic was in, and Demosthenes was out. By Trump, this trend had reached a peak: It was all emotion and plain words, with no hint of aiming for dignity or what used to be called \u201crhetoric\u201d in the good sense.\n\nYet despite what Orwell might have hoped, this plain speech did nothing to stop Trump. It may indeed have been his biggest weapon. If he lied, voters either didn\u2019t know, or they gave him a pass. And if he promised something unconscionable, like torturing terrorism suspects\u2014\u201cI\u2019d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding\u201d\u2014many people either gave him a pass on that, too, or they actively thought it was a great idea. When people want bad things, the man who promises them those things in the plainest possible language is going to win. And beyond those who want bad things, many voters really are ill-informed. So it goes in a big and diverse society in which most people\u2019s job is not politics.\n\nAs Trump and Brexit show, the weight of fixing a broken politics can\u2019t fall on language alone. People need facts and arguments to make their case, not just plain talk. A democracy cannot be better than its voters. There is no easy way\u2014linguistic or otherwise\u2014around the hard slog of educating them to make good decisions.\n\nExcerpted from Talk on the Wild Side: Why Language Can\u2019t Be Tamed by Lane Greene.

Whitaker, a marginally talented former U.S. attorney from Iowa who thinks candidates for judgeships should be asked if they are \u201cpeople of faith\u201d with a \u201cbiblical view of justice.\u201d He makes Steve Bannon look like Adlai Stevenson. Like Bannon, his highest qualification for serving the president as the nation\u2019s top cop is his skill at slathering Trump with his fawning and bootlicking. As acting attorney general, Whitaker will now exercise oversight over special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation, an undertaking he has called a \u201clynch mob.\u201d In 2017, Whitaker claimed not a \u201csingle fact\u201d showed there was any evidence of foreign interference in the 2016 election. He also suggested on CNN that year that Mueller\u2019s team could be throttled by cutting the budget \u201cso low that his investigations grinds to almost a halt.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, as disbelief over Whitaker\u2019s appointment, and its transparent motive, threatened to drown out the helicopter waiting to spirit Trump on his way to Paris, Trump began to backpedal, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know Matt Whitaker.\u201d This despite reports Whitaker had briefed him numerous times in the Oval Office and the fact that last month he told the hosts of Fox & Friends, \u201cI know Matt Whitaker.\u201d When a reporter pressed Trump on whether he had chosen Whitaker to \u201crein in Robert Mueller.\u201d Trump\u2019s surly response\u2014\u201cWhat a stupid question\u201d\u2014only proved it had hit home.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhitaker\u2019s appointment as acting attorney general isn\u2019t good news for the Mueller probe, but it\u2019s nowhere near close to the knockout punch Trump seems to be reaching for. For one thing, the appointment looks legally iffy to former acting solicitor general Neal Katyal and attorney George Conway (Kellyanne\u2019s husband). Writing for the New York Times op-ed page this week, they asserted that the appointment sidesteps the Senate\u2019s power to confirm and hence violates the Constitution. \u201c[I]t it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid.\u201d\n\nOn a more practical note, Ben Wittes explains in the Atlantic that Trump can\u2019t undo 541 days of Mueller\u2019s work by putting Whitaker in a supervisory capacity now. Mueller has subpoenaed the hell out of the Trump universe, enlisted countless prosecutors and FBI agents in collecting and assessing evidence, and refined many of the unknown unknowns of the Russian meddling into known knowns.\n\nOne example of Mueller\u2019s share-the-wealth strategy was his decision to hand off the prosecution of former Trump attorney Michael Cohen to prosecutors of the Southern District of New York to make sure that if anything happened to his investigation, Cohen would still face the music. Mueller \u201chas also let other components handle matters involving core questions of Russian interference in the U.S. elections, such as the Maria Butina and Elena Khusyaynova prosecutions,\u201d Wittes continues. By farming out prosecutions and not insisting on handling every associated case, Mueller has schooled others in the Department of Justice in the ways of the scandal and avoided charges that he\u2019s the big foot from Washington who wants to prosecute every case that falls into his sights.\n\nIf Whitaker\u2019s metaphor is to starve Mueller by cutting his budget, his timing is way off. Mueller is fatter on Trump evidence right now than a September grizzly gorging on a salmon run. Whitaker might be able to hinder Mueller on the margins, questioning his investigative and prosecutorial decisions and overturning any move that violates Department of Justice practices. But Mueller is smart enough to have prepared contingency plans should Trump or somebody like Whitaker attempt to thwart an ethical investigation that has already resulted in convictions or guilty pleas by several of the president\u2019s men, including Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos.\n\nWith the Democrats taking charge of the House investigative committees starting in January, Mueller now has a national megaphone for his findings should Trump and Whitaker attempt to prematurely shut him down. As my colleague Darren Samuelsohn writes, incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Rep. Adam Schiff plans to reopen his committee\u2019s Russia investigation. Democrats also have made plans to issue a summons to the special counsel to testify before the TV cameras should Trump attempt to short-circuit his investigation. \u201cMueller has used silence as a powerful strategic instrument throughout his investigation,\u201d Wittes writes, giving him \u201cenormous moral and political power\u201d on the day he decides to declare \u201cthat his investigation is facing interference from the Justice Department.\u201d Mueller could also write an unclassified summary of the report that he is currently working on for the attorney general and give it to the Democrats for release, which could be damaging to Trump\u2019s political and legal futures.\n\nSpooked at the prospect of a wide-ranging investigation by House Democrats and the prospect of his tax returns being examined by them, too, Trump threatened via Twitter this week that he would use his Senate majority to retaliate by investigating Democrats for leaks of classified information. \u201cTwo can play that game!\u201d But even if Trump\u2019s proxies find evidence of Democratic wrongdoing, that won\u2019t help him much if the Democrats find and air damaging material on him. The game of mutually assured destruction works only if it deters the other side from acting, and there\u2019s no indication the Democrats have been cowed by Trump\u2019s latest bluster.\n\nAs the week ended, Trump found himself plagued by a legal matter that can\u2019t be resolved by persuading a delivery truck with Iowa plates to run over Robert Mueller. The Wall Street Journal, which has controlled the Trump-hush-money-to-his-paramours story from the beginning, reports that denials by Trump, his legal team and his advisers over the past two years that he wasn\u2019t involved in payoffs to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal are bunk.\n\n\u201cThe Wall Street Journal found that Mr. Trump was involved in or briefed on nearly every step of the agreements. He directed deals in phone calls and meetings with his self-described fixer, Michael Cohen, and others. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan has gathered evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s participation in the transactions,\u201d the newspaper writes. Where is this information coming from? The story cites interviews with three dozen people with direct knowledge of the events or who have been briefed on them, in addition to court filings and corporate records. David Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump whose National Enquirer has long protected him and who paid McDougal for her silence, was granted \u201cimmunity for his grand jury testimony\u201d the Journal reports, and \u201ctold investigators about Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement in the McDougal deal.\u201d\n\nIf found guilty of violating campaign finance law, Trump could face five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, according to Larry Noble, former general counsel of the Federal Election Commission. Maybe he could be cellmates with Manafort.\n\n******\n\nShut down my column with emailed threats to investigate me: Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

Five bullets had ripped through me, devastating the right side of my body. Behind the wheel of an airplane, I waited for the shooting to stop and said my Act of Contrition, praying for forgiveness and waiting for the lights to go out.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSomehow, through the encroaching darkness of my final thoughts, I saw my 87-year-old Grandma Emma. All I could think was I am not going to make Grandma live through my funeral. I couldn\u2019t bear the vision of her sitting in front of my casket. Breathing heavily, I pulled myself to my feet, stumbled to the plane\u2019s baggage compartment and took shelter.\n\nI\u2019d come to Guyana as a congressional aide on a fact-finding mission. In the months leading up to the trip, my boss, Congressman Leo Ryan, had been contacted by worried constituents whose loved ones were members of a San Francisco-based religious group called the Peoples Temple, which had fled to South America for the promise of a utopian commune led by their preacher, Jim Jones. They called it Jonestown.\n\nThe night before, our delegation watched Jones\u2019 followers perform a show at their compound. Jones himself sat onstage in a throne beneath a sign that read: \u201cThose who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d The members sang and danced and, by every appearance, were happy.\n\nAt the end of the evening, Rep. Ryan walked onstage and thanked the group. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are a lot of people here who think this is the best thing that happened in their whole life.\u201d He was interrupted by manically enthusiastic cheering. It was utter pandemonium.\n\nAs I scanned the hundreds of smiling faces, I never could have fathomed that within 24 hours, virtually every one of them would be dead.\n\n\n\n***\n\nAt 16, I\u2019m not sure I understood what a state assemblyman did, but when my parents received a solicitation from Leo Ryan\u2019s reelection campaign in 1966, I mailed back a note: I\u2019m in high school. I don\u2019t have any money to donate, but I\u2019d like to volunteer. Whatever impelled me to send in the card changed the course of my life.\n\nRyan did not look or behave like your typical politician. A former high school teacher, he was swept into politics by the idealism of the Kennedy era and elected mayor of South San Francisco before running for state Assembly. Charismatic and tall with salt-and-pepper hair, he commanded a room. He told you precisely what was on his mind, no matter who you were or whether or not you wanted to hear it.\n\nAfter his campaign received my note, I started volunteering as a \u201cRyan Girl,\u201d part of a troop of young women clad in houndstooth bobby hats, miniskirts, black tights, black turtlenecks and bright-white boots. (It was the \u201860s.) We accompanied Assemblyman Ryan to shopping centers and campaign events to pass out pamphlets and speak with voters. The outfits were a ridiculous gimmick, and the role was clearly objectifying. But at the time, none of that occurred to me; I was thrilled to be working for a candidate I believed in\u2014one who always treated me with respect.\n\nA year later, I applied to college, and he wrote me a letter of recommendation. During my freshman year at UC Davis, when I told him about my major, he offered encouragement: \u201cIf you really want to learn about political science, you should come and intern in my office.\u201d I did, and over the years, worked my way up from volunteer to intern to staffer to senior aide, just as he climbed from the state Assembly to the U.S. Congress.\n\nThen-State Assemblyman Leo J. Ryan behind the bars in a Folsom prison cell in Feb. 1970, where he spent a week living as an inmate to learn needs for reform. | AP\n\nHis suggestion that I would learn far more from first-hand experience was in step with the way he approached politics. Inquisitive by nature, he was a proponent of \u201cexperiential legislating,\u201d preferring to go out and experience issues firsthand before he decided what to do.\n\nIn 1965, after riots shook Watts, an African-American neighborhood in Los Angeles, Ryan briefly took a job there as a substitute teacher while serving in the state Assembly, and used the experience to shape education policy. In 1970, as chairman of a committee overseeing prison reform, he assumed a pseudonym and had himself booked, strip-searched and incarcerated for 10 days at Folsom State Prison, revealing his identity only when it was time to be released. After he passed legislation improving prison conditions, the inmates showed their gratitude by giving him a chess set they had sculpted from toothpaste and toilet paper. He treasured it.\n\nThe approach continued even after he\u2019d moved from Sacramento to Washington, D.C. In Congress, he joined a March 1978 Greenpeace mission to investigate the slaughter of baby seals in Newfoundland, Canada. As one of his top aides, I accompanied the delegation, venturing out on the ice floes where the clubbing took place. After that trip, I remember telling myself that never again would I witness such violence at such close range. I admired Ryan\u2019s worthy missions, but questioned if I shared his bottomless capacity to bear witness.\n\nThat same year, Congressman Ryan read a newspaper article about a constituent of his named Sam Houston, whose son had been a member of Jim Jones\u2019 Peoples Temple and, in 1976, died under suspicious circumstances after having a phone conversation in which he confessed to wanting to leave the group. Sam was certain Jones had something to do with his son\u2019s death.\n\nExcerpt from UNDAUNTED: Surviving Jonestown, Summoning Courage, and Fighting Back by Jackie Speier, reprinted under a license arrangement originating with Amazon Publishing. | Amazon\n\nIn the two years since, Jones and most of his followers had left the Bay Area and moved to Jones\u2019 commune deep in the jungle of Guyana. Of the more than 900 members of Jones\u2019s congregation who had moved there, nearly a third were children. Among them were Sam\u2019s teenaged granddaughters.\n\nSam was far from the only person concerned about Jones\u2019 malicious influence over a loved one. A growing body of constituents known as the Concerned Relatives wrote Congressman Ryan with increasing alarm about their daughters or sons who had accompanied the charismatic demagogue to Guyana.\n\nRyan wanted to investigate. I knew him well enough to understand what would happen next.\n\n\n\n***\n\nBorn in Crete, Indiana, in 1931, Jim Jones grew up an outcast and underdog, and was fixated on being recognized as someone greater.\n\nA self-anointed minister, as a young man he started proselytizing outside a storefront church in Indianapolis, and by 1955, had formed the Wings of Deliverance church. Although he had no formal training as a minister and no affiliation with any organized religion, his high-octane enthusiasm and open-armed policy attracted a diverse range of followers. He preached a \u201csocial gospel,\u201d attracting devotees while promoting a community that did not discriminate or take into account race, background, or previous circumstances. His following grew, and Jones became the leader of one of the first mixed-race churches in Indiana.\n\nOver the next decade, Jones moved his congregation and changed its name several times before settling on \u201cPeoples Temple\u201d around 1964. The next year, his church relocated to Redwood Valley, a small community in northern California.\n\nBy that time, darker elements had seeped into Jones\u2019 sermons. He spoke often of apocalypse\u2014Jones chose Redwood Valley because he believed it was one of a few places in the country that could survive a nuclear holocaust\u2014yet insisted the Peoples Temple would exist as a sort of heaven on Earth, with himself in the role of God. Behind his dim glasses, Jones preached love and equality while manipulating his followers\u2014taking their property and having them sign over their paychecks and Social Security. Join me, he assured his followers, and you\u2019ll get health care, education and a family that would never mistreat you.\n\nIt was a message that appealed to the dispossessed, which is why it made sense for the Peoples Temple to relocate to San Francisco around 1972. The tumult of the late \u201860s and early \u201870s had left masses of people searching for a greater sense of security and purpose. Though driven by the kind of underlying insecurity that so often fuels tyrants, Jones appeared to offer hope, redemption, and an idealistic new life. Should they have any doubt of his intentions, they could look to the vibrant community of believers who echoed his sentiments and treated his words as gospel.\n\nPeoples Temple leader Jim Jones (left) shakes hands with San Francisco Mayor George Moscone (right) after being sworn in to serve on the San Francisco Housing Authority, Nov. 24, 1977. | AP\n\nIn San Francisco, his church was lauded for its social programs, and Jones\u2019 efforts to feed the poor and fight segregation found receptive ears with progressive politicians. Jones became active in local politics, giving money, running food programs and busing Temple members to attend rallies and get out the vote for his favored candidates. Among them were George Moscone, who the Peoples Temple played a significant role in electing mayor in 1975, and Harvey Milk, the pioneering openly gay city supervisor, who went so far as to write a letter to President Jimmy Carter extolling Jones\u2019s work and rebutting charges that he was abusive.\n\nMeanwhile, ex-devotees of the Peoples Temple began sharing stories about Jones\u2019 darker side. Their accounts led to an expos\u00e9 in New West Magazine planned for publication in summer 1977. The article dissected Jones\u2019s rise, revealing his practices of manipulation, public humiliation and fake faith healings, called out the Temple\u2019s corrupt financial structure, and included ex-members\u2019 testimonies of sexual assault and brutal beatings by Jones or at his command. Before going to print, the editor of the magazine, who held some esteem for Jones, felt compelled to call him and read aloud the article before it went to press. While on the phone listening to the allegations that would soon be made public, Jones scribbled a note to his aides: \u201cWe leave tonight.\u201d\n\nBefore the New West issue hit the stands, Jones and hundreds of his followers had left San Francisco for Jonestown, their promised land in Guyana.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWithin a year, a few Jonestown defectors had managed to return to the Bay Area\u2014most notably, Debbie Layton Blakey, who\u2019d been Jones\u2019 trusted aide and worked as the Temple\u2019s financial secretary.\n\nRep. Ryan and I arranged to meet her. We listened as she offered a detailed and disturbing account of her experience. She mentioned a Bay Area couple, the Stoens, who had defected and were fighting for the return of their young son, John. Debbie said the couple had gone to court to try to compel the Guyanese government to intervene; Rev. Jones responded by telling them that if any actions were taken to remove John, the entire Jonestown population would commit suicide.\n\nThe cover of a Jonestown promotional booklet from 1978. | AP\n\nOnce, Debbie continued, Jones woke up the camp in the early hours of the morning. It wasn\u2019t unusual for Temple members to be awakened at dawn over the loudspeaker and summoned to the pavilion for one of his increasingly unhinged sermons. But this particular morning, Jones told his followers that they had to kill themselves to keep from being tortured by mercenaries who were preparing an ambush. Debbie stood in line to drink the red liquid that she was told would kill her in a matter of minutes. When the time of their supposed deaths came and went with everybody still alive, Jones announced it had just been a drill to test their loyalty. They had passed.\n\nWe compiled similar testimonies from other defectors who corroborated Debbie\u2019s reports of physical and sexual abuse, forced labor and captivity. We heard that the church had weapons, and that Jones was paranoid and possibly on drugs. He had engineered complete authority\u2014collecting members\u2019 Social Security and disability checks, and determining when and how his disciples could communicate with their families. Anyone running afoul of Jonestown\u2019s security detail was put in a labor camp and forced to clear jungle. Repeatedly, the defectors mentioned forced participation in mass-suicide rehearsals known as the \u201cWhite Night trials.\u201d\n\nLeo Ryan wanted answers. Never one to accept second-hand information, he decided to embark on a fact-finding\u2014and potentially life-saving\u2014trip. He knew that Jones had considerable political clout, with close ties to Democratic leaders in San Francisco, Sacramento, and even with the State Department. Politically, there was nothing to gain\u2014and everything to lose\u2014by taking on Jones, and there was no telling what he\u2019d do if confronted and challenged. None of those red flags made the congressman reconsider.\n\nLeo Ryan assured me that there was nothing to worry about. Besides, when had a congressman ever been assassinated on foreign soil while on a congressional delegation trip?\n\nRyan invited members of the press and a few of the Concerned Relatives to join him. And he assigned two of his staff members to come along: Jim Schollaert and me.\n\nI had read the articles and listened to hours of testimony. I did not feel confident this was a good idea. But I was one of very few women who held senior staff positions in Congress at the time, and I was concerned that if I gave in to my reluctance and let a male colleague go in my place, I\u2019d be setting back women in politics.\n\nCongressman Ryan assured me that there was nothing to worry about. He genuinely believed that he had some sort of protective shield around him, despite the fact that we weren\u2019t traveling with any military escort or protection. Besides, when had a congressman ever been assassinated on foreign soil while on a congressional delegation trip?\n\nOn the plane to Guyana, Nov. 18, 1978. Left-right: Jim Schollaert, Jackie Speier and Congressman Leo Ryan. | AP/San Francisco Examiner\n\n***\n\nWe landed in Georgetown, Guyana\u2019s capital, on November 14, 1978.\n\nThe morning after our arrival, Congressman Ryan, Jim Schollaert and I attended a closed-door briefing by Ambassador John Burke and his staff at the U.S. Embassy. Dick Dwyer, an embassy official, showed us a slideshow of his visit to Jonestown the previous May\u2014images in which he and Jim Jones looked unnervingly chummy; images of tables filled with food, of joyful children on a swingset, of bountiful crops and an exuberant church session. It looked staged. Chief among my concerns was how cozy Jones appeared to be with members of the embassy: How could any Jonestown resident feel safe reporting an injustice to a U.S. official who is arm in arm with Jim Jones in every image?\n\nOn November 17, we landed at the tiny airstrip at Port Kaituma. A few Temple members stood in front of a rusty dump truck waiting to shuttle us to the compound. Congressman Ryan and I were among the first shift of the delegation to climb in for the excruciatingly slow six-mile drive to the commune. Members of the press and the Concerned Relatives waited behind on the airstrip until the truck could come back for a second load.\n\nJones greeted us at the compound. As I shook his hand, I looked at his sideburns. One of the defectors we\u2019d interviewed claimed that Jones dyed them black. Sure enough, I could tell he had. And then I realized that confirming one tiny detail could mean that the worst of the testimonies were true.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know why you\u2019re here, but we\u2019re happy to have you,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see what a wonderful place it is.\u201d He took us on a tour highlighting the most favorable aspects of the commune. We saw an impressive community with dozens of pathways, cabins, a medical center, a little school, and a large pavilion where the members congregated regularly. It was imminently clear Jonestown was a hierarchical community, with the power structure resembling some sort of plantation: the majority of the Temple members were black, while the leadership was almost exclusively white. It did not sit well with me.\n\nJim Jones with a group of children living at Jonestown, circa 1978. | California Historical Society\n\nAt one point, Congressman Ryan interrupted our tour to make sure that the press and Concerned Relatives had been given the transportation to join us. Reassured that they were on their way, we parked ourselves at a few picnic tables in the far corner of the pavilion area. Ryan and I asked one or two Temple members at a time to come talk to us. We didn\u2019t want a group to present a canned response or any individual to look to others for their answers. We worked quickly to locate and speak to the individuals whose families had contacted our office and had been campaigning for their return.\n\nNone of the Temple members showed any interest in receiving correspondence from home. Not a single person we spoke to expressed a desire to leave, not even those whose family members had flown all the way to Guyana. They all swore that Jonestown was the one and only place they could ever consider home. Individually, their insistence would have been hard to question. But listening to one after the other after the other say the same choreographed thing made me uneasy.\n\nNBC news correspondent Don Harris was part of our delegation, and was well versed on the accusations against Jones. At the compound, Don wandered off to smoke a cigarette. A man followed him and slipped a folded piece of paper into his hand, then disappeared back into the crowd. Don put it in his pocket and took a few more steps before carefully unfolding it. \u201cVernon Gosney and Monica Bagby,\u201d it read. \u201cPlease help us get out of Jonestown.\u201d Soon after, Don was approached by another member, who claimed that many Temple members desperately wanted to leave but were too terrified to come forward.\n\nDon hung back for a moment before approaching Congressman Ryan and me at the picnic table and surreptitiously passing along the note.\n\nI felt my stomach knot. Oh my God: It\u2019s true.\n\n\n\n***\n\nRyan decided that we would wait until the morning and suggested we keep a low profile until then. We split up, as Jones had arranged. In a cabin with about six women from the Temple, I took a top bunk, sweating as a downpour opened up outside. I barely got a wink of sleep.\n\nAt the pavilion for breakfast, I did my best to appear unruffled. I noticed an elderly woman stuffing pieces of bacon into her pockets; the ample spread was just another showpiece. I asked to speak to Monica Bagby, one of the names on Don\u2019s note. Monica confirmed that she wanted to leave. She had an extremely anxious demeanor, and we moved quickly as we went to her cabin to pack. Returning to the pavilion area, I sought out other anxious-looking members.\n\nI spoke with a woman named Edith Parks, the matriarch of three generations of Temple members who wanted out. As I took down their names, I looked over at Don Harris, who was interviewing Jones. By that time, it was obvious that some of his disciples intended to leave.\n\nAs soon as it became clear that we would be bringing more than one or two defectors home with us, the communal fa\u00e7ade cracked. Increasing numbers of people approached us. Traumatizing family rifts erupted on the spot, with mothers and fathers engaged in literal tug-of-wars over their children. My list kept growing\u2014what started with two names was now more than 40. With Jones\u2019s wild gaze on us, I tape-recorded affidavits of their wishes to return to the United States.\n\nI was feet away from Jones, close enough to hear him trying to convince people to change their minds. When cameras were rolling, he spoke of how he loved them and how there would always be a place for them\u2014but those declarations would be followed by thinly veiled mutters about treason and liars. Jones wove his way through the camp, repeating that he wasn\u2019t upset that they wanted to leave; it was just that they were doing it in the wrong way. He was cracking.\n\nSo many people wanted to defect that we had to call Georgetown to request an extra plane. We\u2019d have to make multiple trips in the truck. I would be in the first group; Congressman Ryan insisted that he stay behind to make certain that every person who wanted to leave made it to Port Kaituma safely.\n\nThen, as a group of men dug the truck out of the mud, we heard a loud commotion from the pavilion. Moments later, Congressman Ryan emerged from a throng of people with a torn and bloodied shirt. While trying to keep the peace, he had been attacked with a knife. Ryan joined us for the trek\u2014one of roughly two dozen of us crammed in the bed of the truck, with dozens of would-be defectors left behind, belongings packed, waiting to escape.\n\nLarry Layton had gotten onto the truck with us, which struck me as a glaring red flag\u2014he was an entrenched member of the hierarchy, one of the true believers. It made no sense that he would be trying to leave Jonestown. He had on a big yellow poncho, and his eyes were set in a sullen glare.\n\nAt Port Kaituma, while I ushered the defectors onto a plane, a large red tractor-trailer rumbled onto the airstrip. I couldn\u2019t immediately identify the deafening sound that filled the air. Everybody bolted in different directions. Before I could even comprehend what was happening, about a dozen men leapt from the tractor, leveled their automatic weapons, and fast approached. I heard screams and the rapid pounding of gunfire. I dove beneath the plane, hiding behind the wheel as bullets thumped against the metal above me.\n\nSuddenly, my body was crushed by a blow to my side. It felt like a Mack truck had just sped over me.\n\nFive bullets hit me from point-blank range, piercing my right arm, leg, and back. Indescribable pain consumed me, leaving room only for a fleeting thought that I should pretend to be dead.\n\nThe chaos persisted until, abruptly, a silence fell. I have no idea how much time passed until I turned my head and opened my eyes. Bodies lay crumpled on the tarmac around me. There was no movement, but I thought the others might also be playing dead. Congressman Ryan\u2019s body was probably 15 feet away. I was later told that he had been shot 45 times. It\u2019s hard to know when it became obvious that he was dead, or when I realized that others weren\u2019t pretending.\n\nBut the moment I looked down at my own body is locked in my mind. A bone shot out of my right arm, and a huge hunk of flesh had been blown off my thigh.\n\nTwelve hours had passed as I lay, teetering on death\u2019s precipice when a light turned on inside me: The simple fact that I knew I was dying was proof that I was, indeed, still alive. I just needed to hang on.\n\nAlmost 22 hours after the ambush, I heard the groan of a plane\u2019s engine\u2014finally our escape had arrived. Onboard, every bump we hit shot an arrow of pain through my body. When we touched down in Georgetown, a U.S. Air Force medevac plane was waiting. As I was transferred onto a gurney, I was conscious enough to look up and see a big, gleaming white plane with The United States of America written on the side. That was the last moment I remember with any real clarity before I surrendered my body to the medical staff.\n\nJackie Speier manages a smile as she is wheeled on a stretcher at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, Nov. 20, 1978. | AP\n\n***\n\nMany hours before the plane came, somehow, word filtered in that after Jones had released his death squad to the airstrip, he had led more than 900 of his flock into his \u201cWhite Night\u201d of death. All of those people I had been standing beside, speaking to, sharing a cabin with. All of those children. It was impossible to cope with the pain.\n\nThere is a sickening recording of Jones coercing his followers that day. With the camp surrounded by his armed guards, he told his followers to give \u201cthe medicine\u201d\u2014grape FlavorAid and Kool-Aid laced with cyanide and tranquilizers\u2014to the children and the elderly first.

Nearly 300 children were administered the poison with no comprehension of what it meant, including a number of infants in the arms of their parents. Infants cannot commit suicide. The hundreds of elderly were told that if they attempted escape, they would be left to die prolonged deaths alone in the depths of the jungle.\n\nThe news at the time and the history lessons to follow usually fail to mention that a number of Peoples Temple members were shot, several of whom were in the field between the pavilion and the jungle, clearly trying to escape the massacre. Others, who presumably refused to \u201cdrink the Kool-Aid\u201d\u2014a flippant, misguided phrase I very much wish could be scrubbed from our lexicon\u2014were injected with cyanide and other poisons.

They also failed to pick off Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds \u2014 despite near-optimal conditions of a freshman incumbent, massive turnout and tariffs weighing heavily on rural voters \u2014 and lost the Ohio gubernatorial race, winning just nine of 88 counties after Trump carried the state by 9 percentage points in 2016.\n\nYet those statewide defeats Tuesday were balanced with promising signs such as the election of new Democratic governors in Michigan and Wisconsin, and Gov. Tom Wolf\u2018s easy reelection in Pennsylvania.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now. Stay in the know. Follow our presidential election coverage.

Yeah, sure. But I\u2019m talking about winning \u2026 We\u2019re talking about winning here, we\u2019re not talking about some fanciful notions.\u201d\n\nNo red state has appeared riper for a takeover than Georgia, where the non-white population\u2019s explosive growth has buoyed Democrats and where Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 by less than 6 percentage points. Democrats performed far better in Georgia this week than they have in recent years, with a still-uncalled gubernatorial race and runoffs for secretary of state and a seat on the state\u2019s public service commission.\n\nBut even in Georgia, Republicans had prevailed in the statewide races that had been called. And the Democratic candidate for governor, Stacey Abrams, was running just less than 2 percentage points behind her Republican rival, despite her national profile and aggressive campaigning in the state by prominent Democrats, including several potential 2020 contenders.\n\nThe result was similarly positive for Democrats \u2014 and equally unconvincing \u2014 in Arizona. Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema took a narrow lead Thursday over Republican Rep. Martha McSally in a Senate race that remains too close to call. But Sinema, a moderate who broke with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and often votes with Trump, has a more conservative voting record than any likely Democratic presidential nominee. And Republicans swept their other statewide races.\n\nIn Texas \u2014 a bastion of conservativism and perennial fixture of the Democratic imagination \u2014 the outcome was even starker. Not only did Democrats\u2019 top midterm sensation, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, fall short in his effort to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, but the incumbent Republican governor, Greg Abbott, won reelection by more than 13 percentage points.\n\n\u201cTexas has been four years away from being competitive for 40 years,\u201d said Peter Ernaut, a veteran Republican strategist who has advised Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and former Sen. John Ensign. \u201cI hear a lot of people talking about Arizona becoming competitive. I don\u2019t know about that either. I kind of believe it when I see it.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats focused primarily on the party\u2019s 2020 primary, if nothing else the midterm elections confirmed Trump\u2019s apparent vulnerability, with Democrats seizing control of the House and making inroads in the nation's governorships. Senate candidates backed by the president fell short in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe gubernatorial and Senate victories were critical to Democrats reeling from Trump\u2019s victories in those three states in 2016, following decades of Democratic dominance in presidential elections.\n\nWhile Trump is likely to compete again in all of those places, Democrats this week may have put other states out of his reach. Republicans flat-lined in Minnesota and Nevada, the two Democratic-leaning states that once appeared to represent Trump's best opportunity to plow new ground.\n\nTrump lost Minnesota by only 1.5 percentage points in 2016, and he said at a midterm rally in the state that it would be \u201creally, really easy,\u201d for him to win Minnesota in 2020.\n\nBut Democrats there all but ran the table this week, winning the governorship and two Senate races, picking up two House seats and flipping the state House.\n\nRick Kahn, a friend and former campaign treasurer to the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, described the election as a \u201cpolitical reordering.\u201d Kahn, who helped Rep. Tim Walz in his successful gubernatorial campaign, said, \u201cI don\u2019t see how Trump can possibly \u2026 I\u2019d be shocked if they even bothered to try to compete.\u201d\n\nThen there are the two Western states where Trump, despite losing in 2016, had been expected to compete: Colorado and Nevada. Both states elected full slates of Democrats on Tuesday, and in Nevada \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s campaigning for the incumbent \u2014 Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen unseated Republican Sen. Dean Heller.\n\nSurveying the landscape for Republicans and Democrats alike, Jon Seaton, a Washington-based strategist and former adviser to Sen. John McCain, said, \u201cAt the end of the day, for all the talk of realignment, we\u2019re going to be talking about the same five, six, seven states.\u201d\n\nForty of 50 states voted for the same party from 2000 to 2012. For anyone expecting 2020 to be different, he said, \u201c2018, as I\u2019m looking at it, is certainly a reality check.\u201d\n\nErnaut, who is based in Nevada, said the results are especially significant to Trump\u2019s prospects of expanding his field in 2020 because \u201cthe election in Nevada on Tuesday was more a referendum on the president than anything else.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThey have a daunting challenge to turn that around.\u201d\n\nDoug Rubin, a political strategist who has advised former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 both potential 2020 candidates \u2014 said that regardless of the result, Democrats\u2019 performance in Georgia and Texas compared favorably to Republicans\u2019 faltering in Democratic-leaning states such as Minnesota and Nevada, a positive sign for 2020.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no state where Trump is gaining ground in a place where he shouldn\u2019t be gaining ground,\u201d Rubin said.\n\nFor Democrats, Rubin said, \u201cThis is not like a one election thing \u2014 these things take time.\u201d\n\nAnd even if Democrats fall short in 2020 in a traditionally red state, the threat of a competitive election will force Republicans to spend money and time there, as Trump did in the midterms.\n\nFollowing this week\u2019s elections, Rubin said, \u201cRepublicans are going to have to spend money in those states now to make sure they stay red in presidential years. It takes money away from other sates.\u201d\n\nIt is also possible, Democrats say, that Trump will fall out of favor in a red state, or that a Democrat with ties to a red state could galvanize support there.\n\n\u201cIt depends who\u2019s on the top of the ticket,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. \u201cA lot of the candidates at the top of the ticket will have different paths \u2026 I think some candidates would have to win by expanding the map. Some candidates would have a better chance on traditional maps, like we\u2019ve seen over the last few cycles.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cA smart campaign will take a look at an expanded map at the beginning, and then start to concentrate resources over time. And I think that expanded map would include Georgia, Texas and Arizona, depending on the candidate.\u201d\n\n", "Sen.

In fact, they took heart in a GOP that\u2019s \u201csliding in the suburbs,\u201d as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) put it to reporters in his home state on Friday.\n\nSchumer stayed characteristically sunny this week in his first post-election chat with reporters.

Even the liberal activists who occasionally gripe that he\u2019s not being aggressive enough in challenging Trump aren\u2019t calling for his head. Additionally, if Democrats can eke out victories in Arizona and Florida races that remain too close to call, Schumer will hold Republican gains to a net of one seat.\n\nIf Democratic senators recognize the brutal two years ahead of them, as McConnell uses his heftier majority to shut down House Democratic priorities and steamroll through more judicial confirmations, they\u2019re not letting their anxiety show.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) pointed to the three conservative states that voted to expand Medicaid last week as just one example of voters embracing his party\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cLook at Medicaid expansion and voting rights and minimum wage \u2014 our ideas are popular,\u201d he said. \u201cEconomic populism and health care are winners for us.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans are equally confident that their party has locked in an enduring majority on the strength of the most favorable midterm map in more than a decade.\n\nThe GOP has to defend 22 seats in 2020, but only about a half-dozen of those can be considered instantly competitive without a strong Democratic recruit. Republicans are also expected to mount serious efforts against two Democratic incumbents, Sens. Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan.\n\nAfter picking up more seats on Tuesday, \u201cI do think we\u2019ve got a great chance of holding onto the majority for years to come,\u201d said Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who is running to lead the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm for the next Congress.\n\nSchumer\u2019s tough spot will be made only more difficult as multiple members of his caucus jockey for position ahead of the 2020 presidential primaries. His role as Washington\u2019s most powerful Democrat will also be diminished; with the House turning blue, Schumer will have to compete with a Democratic speaker for the microphone he\u2019s relished using over the past two years.\n\nEven so, his Democrats are standing by him. Sen. Chris Murphy hailed Schumer\u2019s ability \u201cto feel the new center and adjust.\u201d\n\n\u201cChuck is adaptive. He is relentlessly in touch with members to get a sense of where the pulse is shifting and he\u2019s very good at getting out ahead of it,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said in an interview.\n\nSen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) predicted that Schumer will shine as he navigates the shadow presidential primary among as many as a half-dozen of his Democrats.\n\n\"I think you will see Sen. Schumer\u2019s real strengths of caucus leader as he navigates the big egos of several senators launching presidential campaigns in our caucus,\u201d Coons said. Coons added that he\u2019s talked to Schumer every day since the election, and that Schumer was trying to call him during a Friday telephone interview with a reporter.\n\nSchumer's trademark volubility was on full display this week as he addressed Trump's rosy view of Senate Republican midterm wins, publicly warning the president that \u201cif you can only campaign in the reddest states that you won by 30 or 40 points in the last election and no one wants you in large parts of America, that doesn\u2019t bode well for your political future.\"\n\nYet it might work just fine for Senate Republicans, as McConnell noted on Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll remind everybody that every state\u2019s got two senators and we\u2019ve got a lot of red states,\u201d the Kentuckian told reporters. \u201cI think that bodes well, hopefully, for the future of having the Senate Republican majority.\u201d\n\nThe GOP is also hopeful that the 2020 presidential contest will help its case by forcing Schumer\u2019s members to tack leftward.\n\n\u201cMost of us believe that overall our country is a center-right nation,\u201d said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), who is up for reelection in 2020. \u201cSome of my colleagues in the 2020 cycle are going to stake out positions on the far left for reasons of their presidential aspirations that are completely unsupported by the majorities of Republicans and Democrats.\u201d\n\nBut while it\u2019s undeniable that Senate GOP candidates powered to victory in rural areas where Trump remains a huge draw, Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia showed it is possible for moderate Democrats to win in states where the president remains popular.\n\nSchumer\u2019s caucus will also have a new opening to hammer McConnell next year as the majority leader gets to work rebuffing the new House Democratic majority\u2019s priorities on issues that otherwise poll well.\n\nAnd not every Republican shares Trump and McConnell\u2019s rosy outlook about the Senate GOP\u2019s midterm night.\n\nPicking up seats in the chamber is merely \u201can affirmation of a favorable map,\u201d retiring Sen.

Mattis' decision to refuse refueling to Saudi war planes is seen as a step towards punishing the kingdom for its involvement in Yemen's civil war. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Defense Pentagon: No more refueling of Saudi aircraft bombing Yemen The move was hailed by critics of the U.S. role in the civil war but they called for halting other support.\n\nThe decision to halt refueling warplanes from Saudi Arabia and its allies bombing rebels in Yemen was hailed Friday by Democrats and other longtime supporters of curtailing the Pentagon's support for what they consider an unlawful use of American forces that has contributed to a humanitarian disaster.\n\nBut they also called on President Donald Trump and members of Congress to take additional steps -- including cutting off arms and ending the sharing of targeting information -- to further extricate the U.S. military from involvement in Yemen's civil war.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLate Friday , Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis confirmed the decision in a statement saying \"we support the decision by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, after consultations with the U.S. Government, to use the Coalition's own military capabilities to conduct inflight refueling in support of its operations in Yemen.\"\n\nThe move, first reported by the Washington Post, was hailed as a positive step by those who have been urging the Trump administration to cut off the Saudis and its allies in the conflict, including the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"By finally ending refueling missions for Saudi bombers, the Trump administration is admitting our joint operation in Yemen has been a disaster,\" said Sen.

Ro Khanna (D-CA), a vocal advocate of barring U.S. military support to the Saudi-led coalition, said Congress must also pass a resolution that would \u201censure that all U.S. involvement is shut off.\"\n\nThe Saudi government issued its own statement insisting it had requested the halt to refueling operations now that it has developed the ability to resupply its fighter jets on its own.\n\n\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the member countries of the Coalition to Support legitimacy in Yemen, continually pursue improvements to military professionalism and self-sufficiency,\" the statement said. \"Recently the Kingdom and the Coalition has increased its capability to independently conduct inflight refueling in Yemen. As a result, in consultation with the United States, the Coalition has requested cessation of inflight refueling support for it's operations in Yemen.\"\n\nSince 2015, U.S Air Force aerial tankers have provided mid-air refueling to some of the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s strike aircraft attacking Houthi rebels in Yemen that are backed by Iran.\n\nSome of those strikes have been blamed for deaths of civilians, including a highly publicized bombing of a bus over the summer.\n\n\"The Saudi Arabia-led coalition supporting the internationally recognized Yemeni government continued to bomb civilian infrastructure and carried out indiscriminate attacks, killing and injuring civilians,\" Amnesty International said in a recent report.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has also reported thousands of civilians have died in the conflict and millions have been displaced. It has also fueled the spread of cholera and other diseases due to the destruction of what was already a very poor infrastructure.\n\nThe Pentagon previously maintained that by providing refueling and providing intelligence support it was helping to ensure the strikes were more precise and that civilian deaths were being kept to a minimum.\n\nMattis said in August that the U.S. military support was \u201cnot unconditional\u201d but also insisted that the Saudi military was taking proper precautions and following new procedures after undergoing American training.\n\n\"The training we have given them we know has paid off,\" Mattis told reporters. \"We have had pilots in the air who recognize the danger of a specific mission and declined to drop even when they get the authority. We have seen staff procedures that put no-fire areas around areas where there\u2019s hospitals or schools.\"\n\nLast week Mattis also called for a ceasefire to enter effect this month, saying that \u201cthe Saudis and the Emiratis are ready\u201d and blaming the Houthis for the failure of past negotiations.\n\nSome experts suggested Friday that the Trump administration is also trying to head off growing criticism over its cozy relationship with the Saudi monarchy and expectations that a new Democratic majority in the House in January could force its hand.\n\nThe broader U.S.-Saudi relationship has also come under more fire since the alleged murder last month of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Riyadh's consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nCritics in Congress have called for the White House to pull the plug on a $110 billion deal to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s being done as part of the administration\u2019s effort to get ahead of congressional action against Saudi arms sales and other operational support,\u201d said Michael Knights, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has consulted with the Saudi-led coalition in its campaign in Yemen against both a Houthi insurgency and militant groups affiliated with Al Qaeda.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the administration decided to end refueling because it saw the writing on the wall and wanted to save face before Congress could vote to cut off U.S. support to the coalition,\u201d added Kate Kizer, director of the progressive foreign policy advocacy group Win Without War.\n\nThe practical effect of the new move is likely to be limited. The United States has only provided some 10 percent of refueling support to the air campaign, according to Knights.\n\nIt could still reduce civilian casualties, however.\n\n\u201cRemoval of that support will not end the war,\" he explained, \"but it might make it more difficult for Saudi Arabia to station aircraft over the Yemeni capital.\"\n\nThat\u2019s the part of the country, he noted, where the Saudis have undertaken some of their most questionable strikes, including against rebels on the move.\n\nThe decision was seen by many critics of the U.S. role to date as a significant turning point.\n\n\u201cFor years, the United States has sold weapons to Saudi Arabia and offered targeting and refueling assistance as American-made bombs were sent to kill thousands of innocent people, including children,\u201d Murphy said in his statement. \u201cThe U.S. has radicalized entire generations because there was an American imprint on every civilian murdered there.\"\n\nMore needs to be done, he insisted. \u201cWhy are we still helping the Saudis with targeting?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy are we still selling them the bombs at a discount?\n\nKevin Martin, president of Peace Action, an anti-war group, also credited the Trump administration for taking action but expressed hope it will lead to fully extricating the United States from the conflict if a peaceful settlement cannot be reached.\n\n\"This is an important step, but it is not the end of the struggle to end U.S. support for the war and to end the war itself,\" he said in a statement.\n\nLike others he called on Congress to play a more active role.\n\n\"Congress must pass the Yemen war powers resolutions to bind the administration to this policy shift, to end other forms of U.S. support for the war, and to reclaim its constitutional authority on the question of war,\" Martin said. \"This war was illegal from the start, and it\u2019s time for Congress to stand up and say so.\"\n\nDefense Priorities, a think tank funded by the conservative Charles Koch Foundation that advocates a less interventionist foreign policy, also took a swipe at President Barack Obama for supporting the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen in the first place.\n\n\u201cU.S. military support for this conflict is something President Obama should have never started,\u201d said Benjamin Friedman, a senior scholar at Defense Priorities. The campaign \"is a humanitarian disaster that does nothing to advance U.S. security\u2014if anything it undermines it.\"\n\nHe, too, said the halt to American refueling of Saudi jets should only be the beginning.\n\n\u201cThe United States should end the other forms of intelligence and logistical support provided to the Saudis, including the arms sales aiding their bombing campaign,\u201d Friedman said.\n\nMattis, in his statement Friday, reiterated the need to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.\n\n\"We are all focused on supporting resolution of the conflict,\" he said. \"The U.S. and the Coalition are planning to collaborate on building up legitimate Yemeni forces to defend the Yemeni people, secure their country's borders, and contribute to counter Al Qaeda and ISIS efforts in Yemen and the region.\"\n\n\"The U.S. will also continue working with the Coalition and Yemen to minimize civilian casualties and expand urgent humanitarian efforts throughout the country,\" Mattis added, calling on all parties to \"support the United Nations' ongoing efforts on this new phase in Yemen.\"\n\nThe Saudi government insisted Friday it is seeking the same outcome, via a new attempt to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2216, which was adopted in 2015. That effort to end the conflict peacefully has so far failed to yield results.\n\n\"The Coalition Command expresses its hope,\" the Saudi statement said, \"that the upcoming UN sponsored negotiations in a third country will lead to a negotiated settlement in accordance to UNSCR 2216 and see an end to the aggression by the Iranian backed Houthi militias' against the Yemeni people and countries in the region.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This post has been updated to correct the spelling of Kizer's name.", "Rep.

The odds are long: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell thinks the proposal is unnecessary even after Attorney General Jeff Sessions was pushed out. And it\u2019s easy enough for Republicans to shut down Flake's demands for a vote, unless he and his Democratic allies insist that his plan is included in spending legislation.\n\nStill, Trump is taking notice, attacking Flake on Twitter Friday for pressing forward with the Mueller bill.\n\n\u201cJeff Flake(y) doesn\u2019t want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel, he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the \u2018crime\u2019 of doing a terrible job!

So, in a sense, yeah. I\u2019ll give him credit.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Flake leaves the Senate as a man without a constituency. Liberals and conservatives outside of Washington have little regard for him: The left says he talks a good game but doesn\u2019t back it up, the right sees him as an enemy of the president.\n\nBut Flake is well-liked by most of his Senate colleagues and is teaming with Sen.

He said repeatedly that the GOP \u201ccan\u2019t be the party of Donald Trump,\" but he also acknowledged that the president could still win reelection even if he believes his party is eventually doomed for a series of electoral blowouts.\n\nWhether Trump can win again \u201cdepends on if one, there\u2019s no alternative on the Republican side.

As long as people want to win Republican primaries and Trump is president, they will continue to yoke themselves to Trump, he said, and it will only get worse with a Democratic House investigating and antagonizing the president.\n\n\"The natural inclination, because the president kind of demands loyalty, is to stand by your party, stand with your tribe,\" Flake said. \"So you\u2019re going to see that really play out a lot more than we\u2019ve seen in the past.

He named several special envoys \u2014 roles that don\u2019t always need Senate consent \u2014 for places like Iran, North Korea, Syria and Afghanistan. Tillerson had moved to eliminate many special envoy roles.\n\nThe State Department didn't directly respond to questions about the timing of the latest nominations, but a State spokesman pointed out that Pompeo has \"urged the United States Senate to allow our talented nominees to 'do what it is they have agreed to do on behalf of our nation.'\"\n\nPompeo has in recent weeks accused Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of \u201cputting our nation at risk\u201d by slowing down the confirmation process.\n\nMenendez and his aides have dismissed Pompeo\u2019s complaints, noting that Republicans control the committee and the Senate as a whole, and that many positions are vacant because the administration hasn\u2019t tapped nominees.\n\nMenendez\u2019s office has also questioned the quality and vetting of some nominees. Case in point: Christine Toretti, the nominee for ambassador to Malta, is reported to have had a restraining order filed against her for allegedly putting a bullet-riddled target sheet in the office of her ex-husband\u2019s doctor.\n\nAfter Tuesday's midterm elections, Republicans are expected to grow their Senate majority. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also is set to get a new GOP chairman, Sen. James Risch of Idaho, who is more in line with Trump than the retiring chairman, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee.\n\nStill, there are any number of factors that could keep hampering the confirmation process.\n\nCongress will not be in session much during the rest of 2018. Some of Trump\u2019s nominees have drawn objections from Republicans as well as Democrats. And there\u2019s always the reality that a single senator of either party can severely delay a confirmation through procedural maneuvers.\n\n\u201cHaving a larger majority strengthens the Republicans\u2019 overall hand, but it won't allow them to blindly confirm Trump's dreadful nominees,\u201d said one Senate Democratic aide.", "Livingston Group removes names of former members from website\n\nWith Daniel Lippman, David Beavers and Sarah Cammarata\n\nFIRST IN PI \u2014 LIVINGSTON GROUP REMOVES NAMES OF FORMER MEMBERS FROM WEBSITE: The Livingston Group, the Washington lobbying firm that represents clients including Citigroup and Tulane University, has removed from its website the names of three former members of Congress who had been listed as \u201csenior counselors\u201d at the firm but had done little work for it in recent years, POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Lippman reports.

Yeah.

McCarthy himself took a more hard-line stance on immigration before the midterms in an apparent attempt to woo House conservatives.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you would have a Republican governor of Ohio or Georgia or Florida if the president didn\u2019t go in and campaign in the manner which they did,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy, though, did acknowledge that Trump\u2019s path to reelection in 2020 may not help GOP efforts to retake the House.

Bill Nelson\u2019s campaign and Florida Democrats filed an 11th hour federal lawsuit Friday to block local elections officials from applying \u201carbitrary and standardless\u201d policies for rejecting thousands of vote-by-mail and provisional ballots.\n\nThe lawsuit \u2014 filed in the heat of three nationally watched and disputed statewide elections amid charges of voter suppression and voter fraud \u2014 comes just a day before the noon Saturday deadline for Florida election supervisors to send the first wave of results for the 2018 midterms, so that the state can determine which races to certify and which to recount.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo far, Nelson\u2019s reelection against Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida races for governor and agriculture commissioner are headed to recounts as well as three state legislative contests.\n\nJudging by past elections, thousands of ballots have likely already been rejected because the voter\u2019s signature on file with the county election supervisor does not appear to match the signature on his or her envelope carrying the mailed-in absentee ballot or provisional ballot. More than 2.6 million vote-by-mail absentee ballots were mailed in this election.\n\n\u201cDespite its grave effect of rendering voters' ballots ineffective, Florida's process for rejecting ballots based on signature mismatch is done without any consistent standard or relevant expertise. Some counties use signature verification technology, for example; others do not,\u201d the lawsuit said. The number of VBM [vote by mail] and provisional ballots that are rejected as illegal based on a perceived signature mismatch varies considerably and significantly across counties \u2014 and even, more troubling, across race and party.\u201d\n\nThe suit cites a study from University of Florida political science professor Daniel A. Smith who found that \u201cin Florida, younger voters as well as racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately more likely not to have their VBM ballot counted as valid.\u201d Also, the study said, due to \u201cissues with their signature, eligible registrants in Florida who are younger \u2014 particularly first-time voters \u2014 and who are racial or ethnic minorities are much more likely to have their ballot rejected by a county canvassing board.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, former Democratic congressman and 2016 U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Murphy told POLITICO that his absentee ballot was rejected because his signature didn\u2019t match.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy this happened,\u201d said Murphy, who found out when he checked his ballot status in Palm Beach County online Thursday. \u201cMy signature was good enough in the primary, but now it doesn\u2019t match? So my vote didn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who has falsely alleged voter fraud in Florida in previous elections, has weighed in again with the same accusation, which had been echoed by Scott as he has watched his lead against Nelson drastically shrink and head to a hand recount, prompting the governor to file lawsuits and call for a criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Florida \u2014 I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!\u201c\n\nThe signature-matching requirement in question was placed in Florida statute to prevent voter fraud because it ensures that there\u2019s some way to prevent an anonymous person from mailing in phony votes without getting caught.\n\n\u201cWith today's filing, their desperation has driven them to ask the federal courts to allow voter fraud,\u201d a Scott campaign press release said. \u201cThey are asking courts to overrule election officials and accept ballots that were not legally cast.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s rhetoric has grown increasingly accusatory and conspiratorial as tens of thousands of votes were tallied after Election Day in Democrat-heavy Broward and Palm Beach counties, causing the margin in his race against Nelson to fall below 16,000 and less than a quarter of a percentage point, which triggered a manual recount under Florida law. At the same time, the margins in the race for governor shrunk to also trigger a recount.

The president continued to weigh in on an array of topics on Twitter after takeoff for the hours-long flight just before 10 a.m.\n\nON ACTING AG MATT WHITAKER, Trump claimed \u201cI don\u2019t know Whitaker,\u201d adding that he is \u201chighly thought of\u201d and a \u201chighly respected man.\u201d\n\n-- MAGGIE HABERMAN (@maggieNYT): \u201cInteresting for him to do \u2018I hardly know the guy\u2019 this quickly. He does know him, from repeated Oval Office visits. (This doesn\u2019t bode well for Whitaker becoming permanent).\u201d\n\n-- THE PRESIDENT said he did not speak to Whitaker about special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation. He also lamented that Mueller had not been confirmed by the Senate. In 2001, Mueller was confirmed as FBI director 98-0, with two not voting. And special counsels are not subject to Senate confirmation.\n\nBLOOMBERG\u2019S JENNIFER JACOBS (@JenniferJJacobs): \u201cQUESTION (from @abbydphillip): Do you want acting AG Matt Whitaker to rein in Mueller?

But there\u2019s just no evidence right now that anything illegal has happened. The vote totals are simply changing as more ballots from Democratic counties are being uploaded.

A weak and ineffective guy!\u201d\n\nON JIM ACOSTA AND OTHER REPORTERS: Asked how long CNN reporter Jim Acosta\u2019s White House ban would last, Trump said, \u201cI haven\u2019t made that decision, but it could be others also.\u201d He then turned his ire to April Ryan. \u201cYou talk about somebody who\u2019s a loser. She doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing \u2026 She gets a pay raise, and she gets a contract with, I think, CNN. But she\u2019s very nasty.\u201d\n\n-- TRUMP also rejected reports that press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had shared on Twitter an altered video of Acosta\u2019s interaction with a White House aide. \u201cNo one manipulated it.

But to Where? On the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, there are fresh jitters across the continent.\n\nIt was a shocking statement, one that would have been unimaginable not very long ago. French President Emmanuel Macron, touring the battlefields of World War I, told a reporter that it\u2019s time for Europe to build a real army. \u201cWe have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia, and even the United States.\u201d\n\nYes, the italics are mine, because the notion that America\u2019s oldest ally, one of its closest friends, is even considering the possibility that it might one day need an army to defend itself from the U.S. is an extraordinary development, alarming evidence of the damage President Donald Trump has inflicted on America\u2019s relations with the rest of the world and on the geopolitical principles that have kept the West largely at peace for many decades.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMacron was speaking in Verdun, site of one of the greatest battles of what some still call the Great War. Trump is joining Macron and other world leaders in France this weekend to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day, the end of World War I. That was the war that marked the transformation of the United States into a global power.\n\nUntil 101 years ago, the U.S. had resisted coming to its friends\u2019 aid. Then, in 1917, President Woodrow Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war, saying, \u201cThe world must be safe for democracy,\u201d making moral leadership at least an aspirational element of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nSince then, Americans have fought side by side with European democracies. They ultimately formalized the relationship after World War II by creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO soon became the world\u2019s greatest military alliance, one that has been feared by America\u2019s enemies, valued by military and political leaders, and lauded by every president until Trump.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s dismissive attitude may just inadvertently be making Europe great again by casting doubt on America\u2019s commitment to defend its friends. Or perhaps helping it to unravel\u2014it\u2019s not yet clear which.\n\nNow Macron is leading the charge, aiming to persuade European leaders to move beyond raising defense spending to creating a robust European military force capable not only of defending against known foes but apparently also, as he let on, against a turn of events whose implications boggle the mind: defending Europe from the United States.\n\nEven before he took office, Trump had deprecated NATO, repeatedly calling it \u201cobsolete.\u201d As president, he has appeared reluctant to affirm NATO\u2019s indispensable Article Five, its mutual defense clause. More conventionally\u2014but in a much more crass and undiplomatic style\u2014he made the same demands previous presidents have, asking the allies to raise their defense spending to the agreed 2 percent of GDP. But his complaints came wrapped in disdain for America\u2019s best friends. When asked to list America\u2019s foes, Trump named the European Union. He has repeatedly behaved insultingly toward allies at NATO summits, a fact made more noticeable by his penchant for praising dictators and his unwillingness to criticize the leader Europeans view as most threatening, Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPerhaps Trump\u2019s criticism has been genuinely aimed at persuading Europe to raise its defense spending. (More likely not: Trump has falsely claimed they were cheating the U.S. and not paying their dues to NATO, when their agreement is to spend on their own defense to bolster the alliance\u2019s capabilities.) But what his criticism has achieved is to inject serious doubts among U.S. friends about whether they can rely on America to fulfill its commitment to come to Europe\u2019s defense.\n\nThose doubts now loom over a landscape Macron views with no small amount of concern. In the same interview with Europe 1 radio, the French president declared, \u201cPeace in Europe is precarious,\u201d noting that \u201ca Russia which is at our borders has shown that it can be a threat.\u201d Europe, he said, must be able to \u201cdefend itself better alone, without just depending on the United States.\u201d\n\nMacron has been a leading critic of the rise of nationalist sentiment and authoritarianism across Europe. He warned that the peace and prosperity of the past 70 years are a historical exception, rather than the rule, and noted parallels between the 1930s and current trends, including \u201cnationalism playing on people\u2019s fears.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the 1930s, this time the United States is also led by a man calling himself a nationalist, also playing on people\u2019s fears.\n\nThe chances that Macron will succeed in persuading Europe to build a military force capable of facing down Russia (let alone the U.S.) still look remote. They improve modestly with the UK leaving the EU because Britain has opposed undermining NATO with a competing army\u2014but others in the EU share the concern. Still, Europe took a preliminary step in December to start the process of building a joint military force. The EU, however, remains deeply divided over the issue, not least between liberal democracies and increasingly illiberal ones such as Hungary.\n\nAs Trump and Putin agree to Macron\u2019s request not to hold a bilateral summit when they\u2019re both in Paris this weekend to avoid outshining the official commemoration, concerns about the future will be on many a mind as leaders celebrate a time when America came to Europe\u2019s rescue.\n\nIt\u2019s a striking moment: The mere fact that a major European leader is openly doubting it can count on America\u2019s support can serve only to embolden potential aggressors. For the Kremlin, the astonishing sight of a top U.S. ally musing aloud about becoming an enemy of the United States is reason enough to again pop champagne corks. If Europe is pondering the unimaginable, we have already entered the land of what used to be inconceivable.\n\nFrida Ghitis writes about world affairs.

While the president insults many journalists, these critics say his barbs targeting women and people of color feel especially sharp, and hit at the reporter's basic intelligence and competence as a person. It's a tone that black reporters and scholars of African-American history say particularly stings, given that African-Americans journalists were not allowed into the White House until 1947 \u2014 and that the White House press corps remains overwhelmingly white to this day.\n\n\"Things have gotten contentious between the president and the press, but this is unlike anything we've seen since the days that African Americans were first allowed into the White House to report,\" said Marcia Chatelain, an African-American studies professor at Georgetown University. Alice Allison Dunnigan was the first African-American to serve as White House correspondent, which she gained access to in 1947.\n\n\"Although we have a 70-year history of African-American reporters being brought into the White House, it seems that this president wants to extend beyond those years in the days that they were banned,\" she added.\n\nThe National Association of Black Journalists on Friday said Trump's comments towards Ryan, Philip and Alcindor were \"appalling, irresponsible and should be denounced.\"\n\n\"The most powerful man in the free world is verbally abusing journalists,\" NABJ President Sarah Glover said. \"The past two years have been filled with assaults on the media and Donald Trump's comments this week have reached an all-time low with attacks on three black female journalists.\"\n\nTrump's scolds also drew attention as they came the same week the president repeatedly interrupted reporters who had accents, saying that he did not understand them. To some media observers, Trump's reactions echoed reports that Trump has previously mocked the accent of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi or mimicked the style of Asian trade negotiators.\n\nChatelain said Trump's behavior demonstrates his contempt toward people of color and women, even as he continues to denounce many members of the media as \"fake news.\"\n\n\u201cThese reporters really represent three segments of the population that this president has often used to air out his deepest hostilities, and his deepest held racism,\" Chatelain said. Trump has repeatedly shot down suggestions that he is racist.\n\nOne of Trump's most hostile exchanges this week with a reporter of color came when he sparred with Alcindor when she asked Trump whether he worries his rhetoric is emboldening white nationalists.\n\n\"That is such a racist question,\" Trump fired back, adding that the question \"is so insulting to me. It\u2019s a very terrible thing you said.\u201d\n\nOf course, Trump has frequently sparred with white reporters, as well. Trump told Washington Post reporter Josh Dawsey this week that one of his questions was \"stupid,\" echoing the language he used with Phillip. He also went after NBC News's Peter Alexander on Wednesday, calling him \"fake news.\" And he has spared some reporters of color, such as Fox News White House correspondent Kevin Corke, who is black.\n\nBut journalists and reporters say Trump seemed to go one step further in his attacks on journalists like Ryan, Phillip and Alcindor. For instance, while Trump dismissed Dawsey's question as stupid, he went one step further with Phillip by noting \"I watch you a lot\" and and that she asks \"a lot of stupid questions.\" With Ryan, he added on that she was a \"loser.\"\n\nCritics say the additions are meant to undercut the person's entire character, value and intelligence, not just their professional conduct. They see a pattern, pointing to an interaction earlier this year with ABC News White House correspondent Cecilia Vega when Trump said she \"never thinks.\" Trump also raised eyebrows earlier this month when he called Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who is black, \"not qualified,\" citing \"her past\" and \"her history\" without offering specifics.\n\nThe journalists who were the target of Trump's ire defended each other on Friday.\n\nAlcindor in a tweet came to Phillip's and Ryan's defense, calling Phillip \"a smart, professional, and hardworking journalist. Not only was her question to Pres Trump not stupid, it was asked in public service because it\u2019s what people want to know.\"\n\nIn a separate tweet, Alcindor said Ryan is \"not a loser\" and has \"been winning in her personal and professional lives for a while.\"\n\nPress advocates worried, though, that Trump might bar these reporters from the White House if they continued to hit him with tough questions.\n\nThe White House earlier this week revoked Acosta's access credentials without any indication about if it would be reinstated. And Trump warned Friday that other reporters could have their security badges revoked, too.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, I haven't made that decision,\" Trump said of restoring Acosta's press pass. \"But there could be others also.\"", "Evan Vucci/AP photo Trump: Judge's ruling blocking Keystone XL \u2018a disgrace\u2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump today blasted a federal judge in Montana who on Thursday blocked construction of the Keystone XL pipeline over climate change and other environmental issues.\n\n\u201cIt was a political decision made by a judge.

Our Aaron Lorenzo got an exclusive look at some numbers showing that each of the four companies involved in the program are on pace to be assigned about 40,000 cases this month, up from roughly 12,000 each per month during the 2018 fiscal year. \u201cA total of more than 1.9 million accounts will get turned over on an annual basis at the new rate, putting it near the peak intended amount,\u201d Aaron writes. The program has notched a $22.3 million profit since its launch in April 2017, though it lost money during fiscal 2016 and 2017 due to startup costs. The companies have been paid about $16 million in commissions through Sept. 13.\n\nLosses from costs outstripping collections led the IRS to shutter a previous private debt collection effort. But advocates \u201clike Sens.

The program targets tax underpayments, which are taxes owed by those who have filed returns and agree that they owe, yet haven\u2019t paid off their balances in full. They\u2019re among the toughest to collect on, and the IRS has given up on them itself. \u201cThe fiscal 2018 collection rate was about 1.7 percent, based on $82.2 million collected out of $4.8 billion in unpaid assessments entered in the program that year,\u201d Aaron writes. \u201cThat\u2019s up from the fiscal 2017 rate of about 0.7 percent.\u201d Read more here.\n\nFINALLY FRIDAY.

The department is examining how and when to deploy possibly risky radio jamming tech in populated areas, among other top considerations, our Stephanie Beasley writes. DHS officials said that blocking radio communications to errant drones in large cities, or even more rural areas where wireless device use is widespread, could cause major disruptions. Vetting those risks will require interagency discussions with the FAA and FCC, they said.\n\nSomething to consider: A former FCC official said the challenges of using of radio jamming tech could grow, if state and local authorities also were granted powers to interdict suspicious drones. Their technology might be less advanced, and they might not have the same process as federal law enforcement for dealing with drone threats, the former official said. The FAA bill did not grant counterdrone authorities to non-federal authorities, though airports had pushed to be included. \u201cBut some have suggested that Congress will continue to move slowly until there is more certainty about how drones might be safely brought down in populated areas, especially when radio frequency waves are disrupted,\u201d Stephanie writes.\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO\u2019s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

One familiar name for MT readers: Steven Bradbury, general counsel at DOT. He\u2019s had an impressive legal career, but faced opposition from Democrats and some Republicans (John McCain and Rand Paul) during confirmation for his current job over his involvement in writing the so-called torture memos during the George W. Bush administration. Another name floating around: former New Jersey Gov.

Restore Public Trust, which launched this week, said it filed a dozen FOIA requests Thursday with different agencies. And a survey the group released hints at what it might be looking at, such as \u201cWhether Chao knew about the large-scale fraud committed by Wells Fargo while she made millions of dollars serving on its board of directors.\u201d Also on the list are questions of whether Chao has implemented policies that benefit donors to her husband, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and whether the shipping company owned by her family is financially benefiting from policies and programs she has helped implement.\n\nDOWNHILL TREND: The Cato Institute published an analysis Thursday arguing that public transit has been losing riders at a steady rate, and federal, state and local governments should stop subsidizing it. In fiscal 2018, Randal O\u2019Toole found, transit ridership (including both bus and rail) across the country dropped 2.7 percent from the year before, as it has every year since 2014. In some urban areas the drop has been \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d like in Memphis, which has seen a 47 percent decrease since 2008. Regardless, the report says, transit subsidies have continued to grow, supporting an industry that's \u201cobsolete and irrelevant\u201d in most urban areas. \u201cThe subsidies are merely a drain on the national and local economies without providing any social, environmental, or economic benefits,\u201d O\u2019toole writes.\n\nAviation\n\nLET\u2019S GET STARTED: DOT\u2019s inspector general is launching an audit of FAA\u2019s processes for permitting small drone flights in controlled airspace.

But the impact of those actions is limited because the law generally only applies to transportation projects when there is a major action that significantly affects the quality of the environment, the IG said. Also, highway, railroad, transit and multimodal projects are exempt. So only two ongoing aviation projects are subject to the FAST Act provisions, and the law doesn\u2019t actually impose extra requirements for those.

The looming exit of 20 House Republicans means Trump will lose a number of reliable trade votes. As Trump figures out his next move with China, U.S. businesses that have a stake in the fight are being left in the dark about what\u2019s next and getting conflicting information on what the administration could accept in a deal. Start here:\n\nG-20 TO BE SITE OF USMCA SIGNING: Mexican Economy Secretary Ildefonso Guajardo said the U.S., Mexico and Canada will sign the revamped NAFTA deal on Nov. 30 on the sidelines of the G-20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, even if U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum remain in place \u2014 but he expressed hope there would be some resolution before then.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re attempting to initiate a dialogue so that before the signing we can see if [the Mexican and U.S. industries] can reach a solution,\u201d he said, adding that the ideal scenario would be complete elimination of the tariffs.\n\nCanadian Ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton told our Pro Canada colleagues this week that Ottawa is still arguing against quotas but has started informal talks about what those might look like. Canada would insist that any quota be large enough to allow its exports to grow, he said, and would grudgingly sign the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement even if tariffs remain.\n\nGuajardo said the plan is for the ministers from the three countries to sign the agreement. He said he didn\u2019t expect the signing to be a large-scale event, according to an audio recording of his remarks obtained by Morning Trade. MacNaughton has joked that perhaps the appropriate signatory for Canada if tariffs remain in place would be a junior staffer at the Buenos Aires Embassy, who might sign the deal \u201cwith a bag over his head.\u201d\n\nNo need for changes: Guajardo also said that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer included provisions \u2014 particularly on labor \u2014 that would appease Democrats so there\u2019s no need to alter the deal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any necessity, not even through side letters, to make changes to the agreement. \u2026 The design of this agreement we already have and will be signing considered a scenario where there\u2019s be a Democrat-majority Congress,\u201d he said.

If that happens imminently, Small Business Administration chief Linda McMahon is the leading candidate to replace Ross, two sources familiar with the discussions said. \"McMahon has made clear she is interested in the position and would accept it if it is offered,\" report POLITICO's Eliana Johnson, Gabby Orr, Annie Karni and Ben White.\n\nRoss has backed Trump's tariffs on trade partners, but the president \"has expressed private frustration\" about the 80-year-old billionaire, the foursome writes. Ross' job security will also \"depend on the extent to which newly empowered Democrats in the House decide to probe the Commerce secretary\u2019s finances and questions about his divestment of assets, a White House official said. If Democrats decide to press those issues, Ross could have a harder time staying.\"\n\nREPUBLICAN CASUALTIES INCLUDE LONGTIME FREE TRADERS: The more than 20 Republicans who lost their House seats on Tuesday included several reliable voters for trade agreements. Texas Reps. John Culberson and Pete Sessions have been in Congress since 2001 and 2003, respectively. During that time, they voted for every free trade deal sent to Congress and supported trade promotion authority for former President Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nAnother crop of defeated Republicans with shorter congressional careers all voted for the South Korea, Colombia and Panama free trade deals in 2011 and TPA in 2015. Those include Reps. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.) and Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.).\n\nSix others weren\u2019t around for the 2011 FTA votes, but supported TPA for Obama. Those are Reps. Carlo Curbelo (R-Fla.), Rod Blum (R-Iowa), Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), David Young (R-Iowa), Steve Knight (R-Calif.) and Mike Bishop (R-Mich.).\n\nSome Republicans who lost Tuesday voted no on TPA in 2015, including Reps. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.), Keith Rothfus (R-Pa.), Steve Russell (R-Okla.) and Dave Brat (R-Va.). A few others \u2014 Reps. John Faso (R-N.Y.), Jason Lewis (R-Minn.) and Scott Taylor (R-Va.) \u2014 haven\u2019t been in Congress long enough to establish a trade voting record.\n\nBUSINESS COMMUNITY LEFT IN THE DARK ON CHINA: Trump has begun consulting U.S. companies about what they would like to see in any future trade deal with China \u2014 but his administration is still leaving them largely in the dark as to what might happen next.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear to the business community what is taking shape here,\u201d Rufus Yerxa, a former U.S. trade official who now leads the National Foreign Trade Council, told reporters in Washington Thursday afternoon.\n\nWhat comes next? Yerxa \u2014 who was speaking at the close of the annual meeting of the NFTC Board of Directors, which includes companies like Walmart, Visa, Samsung and Ford \u2014 said members of the business community are hopeful that Trump\u2019s upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires could produce some sort of \u201ca deal to make a deal, or to start a process to resolve outstanding issues.\u201d He added that some of his member companies have been asked by administration officials to identify specific issues they would like to see addressed with Beijing.\n\nThat meeting comes as the Trump administration is poised to increase tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent on Jan. 1. The administration has also threatened a fourth set of tariffs on all remaining goods imported from China.\n\nWho\u2019s in charge? NFTC members are still worried about the conflicting interests within the Trump administration and their goals with regard to China, Yerxa said.\n\n\u201cWe hear different things from different parts of the administration about what would and what wouldn\u2019t be an acceptable deal and an acceptable outcome,\u201d Yerxa said. \u201cSo there\u2019s concerns about, \u2018Is the administration getting its act together to have one coherent proposal, or one coherent outcome from Buenos Aires?\u2019\u201d\n\nTHE BATTLE FOR TRADE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The fight over who will be the next chairman for the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee could come down to a competition between Reps. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) and Ron Kind (D-Wis.). Pascrell already sent fellow committee members a letter explaining why he\u2019s the best for the job. But others have asserted that Kind would have first dibs since he sits ahead of Pascrell on the dais. In fact, both lawmakers entered Congress in the same January 1997 class and got seats on the committee the same year, in 2007. Still, Kind technically has seniority since lawmakers of the same class who enter a committee at the same time are assigned seniority by lottery.\n\nOne House aide, however, discounted using seniority, arguing doing so would displace a sitting committee leader (Pascrell is currently ranking Democrat on the subcommittee) on the basis of a coin flip that occurred in January 2007, when the two lawmakers got their committee assignments.\n\nSEMICONDUCTOR GROUP OUTLINES GOALS FOR FUTURE TRADE DEALS: An industry group representing global semiconductor manufacturers has outlined its 10 goals for prospective trade agreements with the European Union, Japan and the United Kingdom. At the top of the list are strong rules against discriminatory policies that put foreign providers at a disadvantage to domestic firms. Two other topline items: \u201cmaintain strong respect for intellectual property and trade secrets through robust safeguards and significant penalties for violators\u201d and \u201cremove tariffs and end technical barriers on semiconductor products.\u201d\n\nWTO CHIEF MEETS WITH ABE AS G-20 LOOMS: World Trade Organization Director-General Roberto Azevedo met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday in the run-up to the annual G-20 meeting, where global trade tensions and efforts to strengthen the WTO are expected to be high on the agenda.\n\n\u201cI am talking to all sides to try to resolve this situation. Instead of escalating tensions, we need to find ways to resolve them constructively,\u201d Abe said in a speech to the Japan External Trade Organization, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year. \u201cThis debate will continue into 2019, when Japan will hold the G-20 presidency.\u201d\n\nEU TRADE MINISTERS TO GET BRIEFING: Trade ministers from the 28 European Union member states will gather in Brussels today to be briefed by European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m on EU-U.S. trade relations, among other things.

Will plans and providers exploit telemedicine to pinch pennies by limiting the size of their provider networks? Maybe yes, maybe no, one expert says.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nToday, states deciding whether to approve private plans are required to consider the time it takes for beneficiaries to reach a provider and the distance they travel. But enrollees could be \u201cwell beyond a normal time and distance standard\u201d and still easily access many different providers on a virtual basis,\u201d the proposal released Thursday notes. Under a new system, states could choose other benchmarks to reflect accessibility; states with lots of telehealth providers, such as New Mexico, might opt for different metrics (such as the time it takes to get a virtual appointment) compared to the ones chosen by more densely populated states.\n\nThe proposal cited a 2017 USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy report arguing that telemedicine could make proximity measures irrelevant or counterproductive. The proposed rulemaking\u2019s impact on patients \u201cdepends on how aggressively it\u2019s implemented,\u201d says Mark Hall, an author of that report.\n\n\u201cYou could imagine a scenario [in which] a plan says, \u2018for cost saving reasons, we\u2019re going to farm out all of our psychological therapy services to teletherapy \u2026 for everything and everybody,\u2019\u201d Hall said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if regulators would allow that.\u201d\n\nA CMS spokesperson emphasized that the agency is still gathering comment and that the proposal was in response to states who felt the time and distance standards were too restrictive.\n\nAlex Shekhdar, vice president for policy at the Medicaid Health Plans of America, said the proposal gives health plans more options, but that states still have the authority to deny them.\n\n...In other CMS news, the agency wants to make sure doctors are on-board with its latest regulatory changes intended to give them a break from laborious documentation. In a letter distributed Thursday, administrator Seema Verma unpacked the recent rules intended to overhaul the evaluation and management codes.\n\nOver the summer, CMS tried overhauling the rule by collapsing five levels of codes into two. That proposal was roundly castigated by doctors\u2019 groups, as we reported. The agency responded in its payment rule by putting off the more radical proposals until at least 2021.\n\neHealth Tweet thread of the day: Lisa Bari @lisabari Someone tell me why we can't just ship Smart on FHIR apps for reporting, templates, forms, whatever, that providers integrate into their EHRs?

The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration in September starting gathering public input on privacy principles it plans to formulate.\n\n\"It's not a completely blank hall pass; we will expect to see certain parameters in the legislation, and the devil is going to be in the details,\" Slater said.\n\n\u2014Intel has offered an unsolicited draft of its thoughts on the subject. The company outlined provisions requiring entities to notify people before collecting any data related to their geolocation, biometrics, physical or mental health, sexual life and genetics.\n\n\u201cWhile patients\u2019 medical data is regulated by HIPAA, there is data from outside the clinical area that can reveal information about a person\u2019s health that may fall through the cracks.

(Pros can Read Darius\u2019s story here.)\n\n\u2014And the push for privacy legislation could get new momentum in the Democrat-held House. Lawmakers could focus even more on privacy and other health IT topics in 2019, Darius reports.\n\n\"On the House side, with Democrats in power, I think we'll see a big focus on privacy,\" said Janet Marchibroda, health innovation fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the presumptive Energy and Commerce chairman, circulated a list of priorities Wednesday that included data privacy. Pallone opposed the 42 CFR Part 2 rule change, which passed the House earlier in the year but was not included in the opioid bill signed by President Donald Trump.\n\nBoth consumer advocates and big business are seeking privacy rules, though with different objectives.

In states that allow telemedicine abortion, licensed providers can prescribe abortion medication to patients without being in the same room; consultations can happen via video-chat.\n\n...In other telehealth news, the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Commission is seeing growing numbers of physicians applying though its expedited licensure process, the group announced Thursday. So far 24 states have enacted legislation to join the compact, which makes it easier for doctors to treat patients via telemedicine in states where they aren\u2019t licensed. Since the compact was launched in 2017, member state medical boards have issued almost 3,500 licenses; the IMLCC itself has processed almost 2,000 licenses and renewed almost 500.\n\nVA TAKES A WHACK AT VA UNION MEMBERS: The Veterans Affairs Department plans to reassign more than 400 physicians who work for government unions, our POLITICO colleague Ian Kullgren writes. \"President Trump has made it clear \u2014 VA employees should always put Veterans first,\" Jacquelyn Hayes-Byrd, VA's acting assistant secretary for human resources and administration, said in a written statement.\n\nThe VA said the changes will take effect Nov. 15 and could affect more than 10,000 employees who do union work.\n\nThe reassignments may add to the complications of the VA\u2019s Cerner implementation. As Morning eHealth\u2019s Arthur Allen has reported, VA officials have said \u201cchange management\u201d \u2014 getting clinicians who generally like their EHR to accept the new EHR system \u2014 is the biggest challenge in the $16 billion, decade long implementation. Pros can read the rest of Ian\u2019s story here.\n\nWILL PRECISION MEDICINE LEAVE EHRS BEHIND? Doctors seem to think so, according to a new report from KLAS Research. Almost three-quarters of providers interviewed said they didn\u2019t think EHRs would play a primary role in precision medicine \u2014 mostly because they didn\u2019t think that current health IT is capable of handling the data needed to tailor treatment to individual patients\u2019 genetic and environmental history. Providers said smaller niche vendors were more likely to be able to handle that level of complexity; two respondents who said EHRs would figure prominently in their precision medicine strategy were using a specialty oncology EHR product.\n\nON TAP TODAY \u2014 ATHENAHEALTH EARNINGS: After delaying its earnings report by more than week, the practice management, billing, and EHR company is scheduled to release its third quarter revenue numbers after markets close today. The delay had some customers worried that executives have only bad news to report, they tell Morning eHealth. Leadership is also in the middle of acquisition deliberations, which could have contributed to the delay.

But Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a longtime appropriator and political compromiser, told POLITICO\u2019s Jennifer Scholtes and Sarah Ferris that he believes Congress could tie a deal on DACA to funding for the border wall during the lame duck session that begins next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s an obvious compromise in terms of border security and DACA,\u201d Cole told them last week. \u201cAt some point, it\u2019s going to come back up again. Why not solve it now, after the election and a long way before the next election?\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Mitch McConnell is less optimistic. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine with all the things we have to do here, to wrap up this Congress, that we would revisit immigration. But who knows.\u201d More here.\n\nINSIDE DOL\n\nDOL RESCINDS TIP GUIDANCE: DOL on Thursday rescinded Obama-era guidance that said tipped employees who are paid less than minimum wage must spend most of their time performing tipped-wage duties. The guidance, referred to as the 80/20 rule, required that the tipped employees spend 80 percent of their time performing tipped-wage duties such as waiting tables, as opposed to folding napkins or washing dishes.\n\nDOL, in an opinion letter, said it does not \u201cintend to place a limitation on the amount of duties related to a tip-producing occupation that may be performed, so long as they are performed contemporaneously with customer service duties.\u201d The letter references 25 acceptable tasks for tipped workers, including rolling silverware and preparing drinks.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association filed a lawsuit over the 80/20 rule in July. The trade association argued that the guidance placed a record-keeping burden on restaurant owners. \u201cHow do you keep time records accordingly?\u201d said Shannon Meade, an Restaurant Association lobbyist. \u201cIt\u2019s just an arbitrary number to deal with.\u201d\n\nBut worker advocates say that getting rid of the guidance allows businesses to take advantage of workers by paying them a sub-minimum wage even if they aren\u2019t receiving frequent tips. Seventeen states plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands allow businesses to pay the federal tipped wage of $2.13 an hour, compared to $7.25 an hour for non-tipped employees, provided the employee makes at least $30 a month in tips. \u201cIt certainly seems to signal that this Department of Labor is going to cede to the wishes of the National Restaurant Association,\u201d said Judy Conti, a lobbyist for the National Employment Law Project. \u201cYou\u2019re getting away with not paying them the full minimum wage.\u201d\n\nDespite the change, Meade said the National Restaurant Association will move forward with its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Texas. The complaint alleges that DOL exceeded its authority when it added the 80/20 requirement, inserting it \u201cquietly into an internal agency handbook without notice to the public or an opportunity for comment.\u201d\n\nGOOGLE ADDRESSES WALKOUT: 20,000 Google employees walked out of their offices last week in response to a New York Times report revealing the tech giant shielded one of its software creators following a credible sexual assault allegation. And the company took notice.\n\nToday in an email sent to employees, CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company would no longer require forced arbitration in sexual assault claims and recommit to hiring a more diverse workforce. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need to make some changes,\u201d the email read.\n\nBut walkout organizers say that the effort doesn\u2019t go far enough to address the other issues of inequity at Google. In a Thursday post on Medium, the organizers called on Google to establish employee representation on its board and to provide full rights and protections to contract workers, who they say make up more than half of the company\u2019s workforce and are mostly people of color and immigrants.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment is the symptom, not the cause,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIf we want to end sexual harassment in the workplace, we must fix these structural imbalances of power.\u201d Read Google\u2019s new commitment here and the Medium post here.\n\nJOBS, JOBS, JOBS\n\nJOBS HAVE AMERICANS ON THE MOVE: People are migrating from the coast to \u201csecondary\u201d cities in search of job growth and a lower cost of living, Michele Lerner reports in the Washington Post. Nashville, Sacramento, Atlanta, Phoenix, Austin and Dallas are seeing the highest uptick in newcomers, and \u201cjobs are an important piece of the choice to move,\u201d Lerner says.\n\n\u201cOne thing that makes it easier for people to relocate is that there are more remote workers all the time,\u201d Daryl Fairweather, chief economist for Redfin real estate brokerage told the Post. \u201cIf you can live anywhere, it makes more sense to live somewhere that\u2019s less expensive. At the same time, more companies are willing to open offices in other cities to accommodate remote workers.\u201d\n\nForty-five percent of workers say that jobs and the economy are a factor when choosing a place to live, and another 43 percent say they\u2019re a factor when deciding to move, according to the Prudential American Workers Survey released earlier this week. Take a look at the survey here and read more from the Post here.\n\nPOULTRY PROBLEMS, AGAIN: Democrats are again pressing USDA\u2019s Food Safety Inspection Service on a new waiver policy that would raise line processing speeds at certain poultry plants, arguing that the agency failed to demonstrate that the policy is legal. In a letter provided to POLITICO, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) argue that a September Federal Register notice formally announcing the policy \u201cattempts to defend [its] validity. . .but again fails to show that its criteria meet the minimum requirements of current regulations.\u201d They also complain that FSIS failed to update them over the past 60 days on the status of waiver applications, as requested in a July 30 letter. In response to a request for comment, a FSIS spokesperson directed POLITICO to the September notice. Read the letter here.\n\nMORE 'NOTICE TO APPEAR': USCIS said Thursday it will continue to expand types of visa applications where officers may issue a \u201cnotice to appear\u201d in cases where there's evidence of fraud or criminal activity, or when someone is denied an immigration benefit and lacks legal status. Starting Nov. 19, USCIS may begin deportation proceedings based on denials of applications for T, U, U-1 and I-360 visas. The expansion will also include I-730 Refugee, Violence Against Women Act, and Special Immigrant Juvenile petitions and applications to register permanent residents or an adjustment of status. However, expansion has not yet impacted employment based visas.

A slew of Democratic wins in state capitals in Tuesday\u2019s elections increases the likelihood that more states will pass laws to crack down on companies collecting federal student loans \u2014 in defiance of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to stop them.\n\n\u2014 Democrats flipped six state legislative chambers this week, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. They also picked up seven new governor\u2019s seats.\n\n\u2014 Several of the changes come in states where there\u2019s been an active push by consumer groups and Democrats to pass legislation on student loan companies. The attempts have largely been driven by Democrats, though they\u2019ve won the backing of GOP officials in some states. The industry and the Trump administration have argued that states don\u2019t have the power to regulate companies that collect federal student loans.\n\n\u2014 In Colorado, earlier this year the state House passed legislation that would stiffen rules on student loan servicers. But the bill stalled in the Republican-controlled state Senate, which will now be run by Democrats. The outgoing Republican attorney general, Cynthia Coffman, backed the bill \u2014 and criticized Trump administration efforts to stop it as did Rep. Jared Polis, the state\u2019s Democratic governor-elect.\n\n\u2014 In Maine, state lawmakers this year passed a bill that would crack down on student loan servicers. But it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Paul LePage. He\u2019ll be replaced by Democrat Janet Mills, who as attorney general called for greater protections for student loan borrowers.\n\n\u2014 In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed in his budget to allow the state\u2019s banking regulator to oversee student loan servicers. But the plan ran into opposition in the state Senate, which has been effectively controlled by the GOP. Democrats won back full control of the chamber on Tuesday, which advocates of the loan servicer bill say they hope will clear the way for its passage. New York would be the second-largest state, following California, to enact tougher rules for loan servicers.\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, in Congress, House Democrats have sharply criticized the Trump administration\u2019s moves to stop state-led scrutiny of federal student loan servicers \u2014 and it could crop up as part of what Democrats have promised will be aggressive oversight of the administration. Flashback: Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who is expected to lead the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing education funding, clashed with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over the issue earlier this year.\n\nGOOD FRIDAY MORNING AND WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

We offer our deepest condolences to the Housley family and ask that our community join us in keeping Alaina\u2019s family, friends, and loved ones in their prayers during this incredibly difficult time,\u201d Pepperdine wrote in a Facebook post.\n\n\u2014 Both schools made resources available to students and faculty, including opening up campus chapels.

The agency said it spent $279 million in STEM discretionary grant funds in fiscal 2018 through programs like the Education Innovation and Research grants, Teacher Quality Partnership grants and Supporting Effective Educator Development grants.

The Tennessee Republican said he fears more problems are ahead when the VA seeks to reprocess many claims once an expected IT system change is made.\n\n\u2014 \"I implore you to personally oversee the implementation of these modifications and ensure student veterans and schools are informed about these changes and delays as quickly as possible,\" Roe told Wilkie in the letter dated Monday.\n\n\u2014 The House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee has scheduled a hearing for Nov. 15 to discuss the issue.

We look at why they think it\u2019s too risky for him to veto the legislation while staring down a split Congress next year.\n\n\u2014 Scuttle on Senate committee leadership moves: The midterms have set off a scramble for new committee assignments. We\u2019ve heard talk that Sen. Maria Cantwell wants to jump from her ranking member spot on Energy and Natural Resources. That could \u2014 emphasis on could \u2014 open the door for Senate Ag ranking member Debbie Stabenow to be asked to replace her.\n\n\u2014 When will USDA\u2019s waiver rule land? Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue didn\u2019t provide that detail Thursday. But he said he wants Congress to use the farm bill to restrict states\u2019 ability to issue work-requirement waivers for able-bodied adults enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S FARM BILL THREAT RINGS HOLLOW: Congress comes back to town next week with House and Senate agriculture leaders pledging action on the farm bill in the lame-duck session. Hanging over negotiations is the question of just how dug in Trump is on stricter SNAP work requirements.\n\nTrump on Wednesday blamed Democrats again for delaying the farm bill over opposition to stronger work requirements, and reiterated that he wants \u201cwork rules\u201d in the bill \u2014 a demand that some interpreted as essentially a veto threat.\n\nBetting on a bluff: For now, many food and ag lobbyists are shrugging off Trump\u2019s latest comments. They\u2019re betting he wouldn\u2019t actually veto a farm bill if it doesn\u2019t include new work requirements akin to those proposed in the House measure, H.R. 2 (115), which must be dropped for a final bill to have any chance of clearing the Senate.\n\n\u201cFrom President Trump\u2019s own standpoint, a threat to refuse to accept the bill if it doesn\u2019t contain the House SNAP provisions doesn\u2019t compute,\u201d said Bob Greenstein, founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that works on SNAP policy. \u201cIf he refuses to accept such a bill, the farm bill will die in the lame duck, and the next Congress \u2014 with a Democratic House \u2014 will start over, with the result that the final bill will be even less to his liking.\u201d\n\nVeto virgin: Trump so far has not vetoed any bills. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush each issued 12 during their tenure. It\u2019s worth noting that, back in June, the White House issued a statement of administration policy criticizing the Senate farm bill, S. 3042 (115), for not strengthening SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults, but stopped short of threatening a veto.\n\nHistory lesson: The last time a farm bill was vetoed was in 2008 when Bush rejected the package \u2014 not once, but twice! \u2014 because he thought it was fiscally irresponsible and didn\u2019t rein in subsidies to wealthy farmers. Congress overrode the veto (twice) with an overwhelming bipartisan majority.\n\nIn 1995, President Bill Clinton vetoed a budget reconciliation package that included the first version of what later became the 1996 farm bill, per the Congressional Research Service, but that move wasn\u2019t due to opposition to the farm bill, specifically. President Dwight Eisenhower also vetoed a farm bill in 1956.\n\nNumber of the day: There have been 2,574 presidential vetoes since 1789. FDR issued 635!\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY, NOV. 9!

Our Pro Energy colleague Zack Colman heard chatter that Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, wants to vacate her ranking member post on Energy and Natural Resources next year to jump to the Commerce Committee if Sen. Bill Nelson\u2019s recount bid in Florida comes up short.\n\nCantwell wants Commerce because it oversees numerous interests in her state (think Boeing, Amazon, ports, commercial fishing). \u201cThere\u2019s an understanding among the staff\u201d of her interest, a former Senate aide said.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: Cantwell\u2019s exit from the panel could elevate Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to the ranking member role, but he\u2019s more consistently voted with Republicans than Democrats on an array of environmental and climate issues.\n\nWhat about Stabenow? If Nelson goes down, some sources have suggested that Senate Ag\u2019s top Democrat could be asked to switch to the ranking member post on Energy and Natural Resources because she outranks Manchin on that panel. She is also more aligned with rest of the party on issues the committee handles.\n\n\u201cThere is pressure on Stabenow to finish farm bill in the lame duck so that she could more easily make the transition to Energy,\u201d an energy industry source said.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a Stabenow spokesperson said, \"It\u2019s obviously too early to comment since there are Senate races still undecided, however Senator Stabenow is committed to continuing to serve as ranking member of the Senate Ag committee.\"\n\nMA thought bubble: It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether Stabenow would relinquish her gig on Senate Ag, even if a farm bill passes this year. Given agriculture\u2019s importance in Michigan, MA thinks it\u2019s unlikely. But sources told Zack that moving to Energy and Natural Resources could allow her to oversee electric vehicles \u2014 no small policy matter in Detroit.\n\nUSDA STILL HOLDING OFF ON SNAP WAIVER RULE: The November election came and went, and the Agriculture Department didn\u2019t issue its proposal to tighten up the waiver process for states seeking to exempt able-bodied adults without dependents from SNAP work requirements \u2014 and it appears the Trump administration is likely to keep holding off as farm bill talks roll on.\n\nThe timing: The rule, now parked at OMB, was initially slated for release last month. Many expected USDA to release the proposed rule before the election as a way to help galvanize the right. But Perdue has repeatedly said he doesn\u2019t want to preempt Congress on the issue, which could be addressed in farm bill conference talks.\n\nDear states: Perdue last week implored governors in all 50 states to rethink their use of the waivers, Pro Ag\u2019s Helena Bottemiller Evich reported earlier this week. In a letter, the secretary noted that in fiscal 2016, 1.7 million of 3.8 million able-bodied adults without dependents who received SNAP benefits lived in places that received waivers.\n\nHow it works: This group, known as ABAWDs, is the primary target of the stricter work requirements included in the House farm bill. Under current law, the group can only receive SNAP for up to three months in a three-year period if they are not working or not engaged in a work-like activity such as training for at least 80 hours per month. States can ask USDA to waive the time limit in places where the unemployment rate is relatively high or where there aren't enough jobs.\n\nThe big picture: Perdue told reporters Thursday that he remains hopeful the farm bill conference report will include something to reform the waiver process. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that Congress, to the best of their ability, be as specific regarding their intentions as they can in law,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we know in a partisan divide it\u2019s difficult to do that.\u201d\n\nSOME H-2A REQUIREMENTS GOING DIGITAL: The Labor Department is trying to bring the application process for temporary employment visas into the 21st Century. DOL will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register today to require U.S. employers seeking workers under the H-2A and H-2B programs \u2014 for seasonal farm labor and non-agricultural labor, respectively \u2014 to first advertise the jobs online instead of in newspapers, reports Pro Employment & Immigration\u2019s Ted Hesson.\n\nThe proposal follows another plan DOL unveiled two weeks ago to use an electronic system for issuing decisions on H-2A applications. The actions are part of a coordinated effort by the Trump administration to modernize the system, which involves the departments of Labor, State, Agriculture and Homeland Security.\n\nPerdue calls on Congress for broader fix: Perdue said in a statement Thursday that the administrative changes are one way to modernize the H-2A system so that it\u2019s less cumbersome and expensive for employers, but he argued congressional action is needed to \u201cfully\u201d address chronic farm labor shortages.\n\nH-2A visas have seen double-digit growth since 2012, despite industry\u2019s complaint that the system is a bureaucratic nightmare. That growth is due in part to both the Obama and Trump administrations cracking down on undocumented immigrants. U.S. farms hired more than 242,700 temporary workers in fiscal 2018, a 21 percent increase over the previous year.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 The race to replace Sessions: Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has emerged as a strong contender for attorney general, following Jeff Sessions' resignation Wednesday, two former White House officials told POLITICO's Eliana Johnson, Gabby Orr, Annie Karni and Ben White. However, several sources said that Trump is in no particular hurry to fill his top law enforcement position.\n\nMcMahon replacing Ross? Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross may follow Sessions out the door. If that happens imminently, Small Business Administration chief Linda McMahon is the leading candidate to replace Ross, two sources familiar with the discussions told Eliana, Gabby, Annie and Ben. Ross has backed Trump's tariffs on trade partners, but the president \"has expressed private frustration\" about the 80-year-old billionaire.\n\n\u2014 U.S., Canada talk options for tariff relief: Canada, eager to escape the 25 percent tariff on its steel exports to the U.S., has had informal talks with Trump administration officials about establishing quotas in exchange for Trump dropping the penalties, Canadian Ambassador David MacNaughton told Pro Canada\u2019s Alexander Panetta. Canada responded to the steel tariffs with retaliatory duties on about $12.6 billion worth of American imports, including food and beverage items.\n\n\u2014 No need to reopen the new NAFTA deal, MacNaughton says: The Canadian ambassador also told Alex that Democrats\u2019 concerns about the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact can be addressed through side letters and wouldn\u2019t require deal to be reopened next year.

He pointed to U.S. Cyber Command\u2019s new Twitter account that publicly shares information about malware that the command discovers. \u201cThat is an engagement saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to take your tools. We\u2019re going to put them out there. We\u2019re going to show your tradecraft. We\u2019re going to make it harder for you to do these kind of operations,\u2019\u201d Joyce said. \u201cAnd by doing that, we\u2019re imposing friction.\u201d\n\nThe government has been tight-lipped about the practical implications of the military\u2019s new \u201cdefend forward\u201d strategy, and Joyce offered no details about how Cyber Command was hacking adversaries with the freer hand that Trump has given it. But he cited the Twitter account as an example of other, less aggressive ways that the government could pressure adversaries and make their activities less rewarding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about making it harder for them to succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of that will be taking away the infrastructure they\u2019re using.

His role as the state\u2019s top elections supervisor and his oversight of the voting process have been riddled with controversy and lawsuits. Just days before the midterms, he accused the Georgia Democratic Party of trying to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system \u2014 an allegation made without evidence.\n\nHis resignation leaves some election integrity advocates hopeful that Georgia may begin making substantial changes to safeguard voting. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that whoever replaces him will do a worse job in terms of election integrity,\u201d Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at Brennan Center for Justice, told MC. \u201cAt this point we can only go uphill.\u201d\n\nVoting integrity advocates have long criticized Kemp\u2019s reluctance to end the use of electronic voting machines without auditable paper trails, relying on systems that cybersecurity experts and this federal judge say are bad for voters. The next secretary of state will have a chance modernize that system. So far, however, it\u2019s unknown who that person will be as the race enters a runoff scheduled for Dec. 4. One of the candidates, Republican Brad Raffensperger, has advocated for updating election machines to move away from the state\u2019s paperless system.\n\nBut the damage Kemp did to the democratic process in Georgia will be hard to undo, said Jenny Flanagan, vice president of state operations for watchdog group Common Cause. \"Kemp's resignation, while welcome, has come too late. Kemp spent his tenure disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Georgians.\u201d\n\nBOB LORD AT ASPEN \u2014 Computer and phone makers should configure their products to automatically install software updates by default, and browser makers should incorporate security features, like forcing HTTPS, that are currently only available as third-party add-ons, the DNC\u2019s chief security officer said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019d love to see the operating system vendors start to figure out how to start patching so that it becomes harder and harder to not run a patched system,\u201d Bob Lord said at the Aspen Cyber Summit, adding that the security community should also \u201cstart leaning on the browser manufacturers to adopt some additional controls.\u201d\n\nDuring the midterm campaign, the DNC distributed a one-page cybersecurity checklist to campaigns and party organizations, and Lord said he planned to \u201cwork with them a little bit more closely\u201d on security. But he added that \u201cthere are some things where we should be pushing on the technology providers to do a much better job in getting to that next level and making these things secure by default.\u201d\n\nLord also compared the voting technology industry of 2018 to the broader tech industry of 10 or 15 years ago. \u201cWe saw some of these companies, years ago, pushing back, trying to posture, trying to \u2026 sue or make trouble for the people who are responsible for making these issues known,\u201d he said. Over time, the situation improved, but \u201cthat didn\u2019t happen overnight, and it didn\u2019t happen without some wailing and gnashing of teeth on occasion.\u201d He said he hoped voting vendors would invite researchers to help them modernize their security programs. \u201cI guarantee you there\u2019d be people willing to raise their hands and step up and help usher them through that journey.\u201d\n\nATMS UNDER ATTACK \u2014 The infamous North Korean hackers Lazarus Group behind the Sony Pictures attack and WannaCry ransomware are now draining ATMs of cash, according to research from Symantec. The firm linked malware discovered in compromised ATMs in 30 countries back to the cybercrime syndicate. US-Cert issued an alert about the ATM campaign back in October. While Symantec estimates that Lazarus has carried out the attacks to steal tens of millions of dollars since 2016, there are no reported attacks on banks in the U.S.\n\nSO NOT ON THE SAME PAGE \u2014 The Federal Reserve System\u2019s Board of Governors organizational structure is preventing it from doing a better job to protect its data, according to a watchdog report. The inspector general study found division heads \u201ccan make IT decisions without the CIO's approval and are not required to align investments with the Board's enterprisewide architecture\u201d and that \u201cvarious IT governance bodies lack a documented reporting hierarchy.\u201d\n\nHIGH FIVES ALL AROUND \u2014 European Union security agencies agreed on a roadmap for cybersecurity cooperation next year when they met in Belgium this week. \u201cThe initial focus will be on working closer in the areas of training and cyber exercises, building the cooperation capacity and the improved exchange of information on respective projects and events with a view to complementing the work of the four partners and avoiding the duplication of efforts,\u201d the participating agencies \u2014 Europol, the European Defense Agency, CERT-EU, and the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security \u2014 said in a statement.\n\nDuring the meeting at CERT-EU\u2019s headquarters, the agencies reviewed recent developments in cybersecurity and discussed their cooperative activities under a May memorandum of understanding. Jorge Domecq, head of the EDA, said the agencies\u2019 goal was to \u201cpromote civ/mil synergies in the cyber domain, considering also relevant EU initiatives,\u201d to support member countries\u2019 development of cyber capabilities.\n\nSPEND IT WISELY \u2014 DHS on Thursday announced grants totaling $1.27 million to two universities working on ways to measure the value of cybersecurity spending. The University of California, San Diego, received $1.05 million to \u201cdevelop threat intelligence tools and techniques for measuring the reliability and value of a threat intelligence source to an enterprise,\u201d while the University of Illinois, Chicago, received slightly more than $227,000 to \u201cdevelop a cyberattack economic impact model, and a tool to automate data collection and analysis in order to provide near real-time estimates of cyberattack outcomes.\u201d The two research programs are part of the Cyber Risk Economics project in DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate.\n\nVETS FOR HIRE \u2014 The firm Synack, which crowdsources vulnerability testing, launched a Veterans Cyber Program on Thursday to recruit former members of the military to its teams of freelance security researchers.

Under the statute, the president can bar the entry of foreigners deemed \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nMigrants arrested between ports of entry will still be able to apply for humanitarian relief through other legal avenues, such as \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d or protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n\nBut under those programs, migrants face a higher bar to prove a fear of returning to their home countries, and generally aren\u2019t able to petition for a green card or for families members to join them.\n\nThe ban blocking asylum seekers between ports of entry will apply to unaccompanied minors, according to guidance posted online late Friday evening by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nA Justice Department official said the opposite on a call with reporters Friday morning, but DOJ later confirmed the asylum ban will apply to unaccompanied children.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has painted the level of illegal immigration as a crisis, the number of Border Patrol arrests in fiscal year 2018 \u2014 a proxy for illegal crossings \u2014 fell below the average over the past decade. A September 2017 Homeland Security Department report found the border was more difficult to cross illegally \u201cthan ever before.\u201d\n\nThere has, however, been a change in the composition of border crossings. The number of family members caught at the southwest border in the past year reached the highest level since such record-keeping began in fiscal year 2012.\n\nEfforts to push asylum seekers toward ports of entry could result in backups on the Mexican side of the border. When a caravan of roughly 150 migrants arrived at the San Ysidro port of entry in the spring, asylum seekers waited for days as border officials limited the number of people able to make a claim.\n\n\u201cYou cannot simply move all of your resources toward migrant processing,\u201d a DHS official said Friday, adding that \u201cdiscussion are ongoing\u201d as to how U.S. Customs and Border Protection will handle a larger volume of entries at ports.\n\nMexican officials said they counted roughly 4,800 migrants seeking temporary shelter in a stadium in Mexico City, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA September report by the DHS inspector general\u2019s office raised questions about CBP\u2019s use of \u201cmetering\u201d to limit entry of asylum seekers at ports, saying it \u201cmay have led to additional illegal border crossings.\u201d\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker praised Trump in written statement issued Friday morning.\n\n\n\n\u201cThanks to this decisive order from President Trump, we are continuing to provide a path to protection for those who truly need it, while stopping our generosity from being abused,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBut Reps.

Story by POLITICO Pro California's Angela Hart in San Francisco\n\n-- Hours later, a NorCal conflagration had expanded to the point that Newsom felt compelled to declare a state of emergency in Butte County, and more blazes ignited in southern California. The roaring Camp Fire and proliferation of others underscores a point Brown has made often in recent years: Accelerating climate change will make these blazes both more ferocious and more frequent, and Newsom will be on the spot to respond \u2014 not just with emergency declarations but with policies to manage climate change and the complex, multifactorial equation of who pays what when the bill comes due.\n\n-- Oh, and by the way: As Newsom was managing it all, health care groups were getting ready to meet and strategize over what happens next in a policy area that, with the exception of housing, will be the paramount item on Newsom\u2019s agenda.

Ron DeSantis' lead over Democrat Andrew Gillum narrowed to less than half of a percentage point, a margin that would trigger an automatic recount under Florida law. Gillum conceded defeat late Tuesday night but on Thursday, he released a statement saying that all votes should be counted.\n\nGiuliani tweeted: \"Hillary\u2019s lawyers trying to steal Florida election. They are still counting (or creating) ballots just in Democratic Broward and Palm Beach. All other votes counted in the state. Court should disqualify votes counted only after all other counties were finished,\" Giuliani wrote, referring to 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \"Democrats love to say there is no voter fraud in US.

The accusations gained steam among some on the right with the help of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, culminating in repeated calls for Obama to release his birth certificate and his college admissions records. Trump at one point claimed to have seen the president\u2019s birth certificate himself, which he said would back up his claims, although he never released the proof he claimed to have.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe issue fizzled out near the end of Trump\u2019s run for president in 2016, when he held a press conference to announce that he did, in fact, believe that Obama was born in the U.S., but declined to take responsibility for promoting the conspiracy or apologize to Obama for spreading the false claim, seen by many as racist.\n\nTrump has also spread the false claim that the Obamas are Muslims, a statement that has also been identified by many as a racist dog whistle.\n\nThough then-President Obama poked fun at the conspiracy occasionally, Michelle Obama writes in her book that she worried Trump\u2019s claims would incite violence against her husband and her family.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

TGIF.\n\nBAKER SIGNS CIVICS BILL \u2014 Gov. Charlie Baker signed a law designed to kick-start civics education in the state yesterday, just days after young voters across the country turned out in higher-than-usual numbers for the midterm election, according to a post-election analysis from one civics group.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe new law, designed to boost civic engagement, requires public schools teach American history and civics education, provide student-led civics projects and encourage voter registration. The bill also includes a media literacy piece, although, as the State House News Service pointed out on Twitter, media were not invited to the bill signing.\n\nCivics advocacy group Generation Citizen, which had a hand in drafting the bill, says it hopes the law becomes a model for other states. And civic engagement among young people is rising, according to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, based at Tufts University. Across the country, 31 percent of young people ages 18 to 29 turned out to vote in the Nov. 6 election, a 10 percentage point rise over the 21 percent of young people who voted in the 2014 midterm, CIRCLE told reporters earlier this week.\n\nBetween then and now, CIRCLE found the percentage of young people who say they've participated in some form of political activism had tripled. In 2016, only 5 percent of young people said they had participated in political activism. This year, 15 percent say they have done so.\n\nAside from actual participation, that means young people are now also more likely to know someone who has engaged in some form of political activism, like a walkout. And that makes sense. Since the 2016 election, we've seen large-scale political activism during the Women's March, the teen-led March For Our Lives and even the protest in support of Special Counsel Robert Mueller that assembled in front of the State House last night.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

All symbolize the party\u2019s embrace of diversity and its emphasis on the empowerment of new voices.\n\nBut there\u2019s a case to be made that 31-year-old Max Rose deserves to be mentioned in that company. His victory over incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan in New York\u2019s 11th district, which consists of all of Staten Island along with a sliver of south Brooklyn, was one of the region\u2019s biggest upsets Tuesday night.\n\nThe Staten Island-based district has been a Republican playground since 1980, when Guy Molinari defeated longtime incumbent John Murphy, a charismatic West Point grad and war hero who had a run-in with law enforcement in the caper that became known as Abscam. (Those with long memories will recall that Murphy was clever enough to delegate a staff member to carry away a briefcase stuffed with cash after meeting with undercover FBI agents. That bit of quick thinking led to his acquittal on bribery charges, although he was found guilty of taking an illegal gratuity, which made it sound like he had a side job working tables at his local eatery.)\n\nThe district has not only been solidly Republican since then \u2014 it has been a Molinari legacy, quite literally. Susan Molinari succeeded her father in the seat, and when she quit in 1997, Guy Molinari handpicked Vito Fossella for the seat. He had a spot of bother involving a second family, so he chose to forgo re-election in 2008. Democrat Michael McMahon won the seat but then lost it in 2010 to a man often described as Molinari\u2019s surrogate son, Michael Grimm. And Grimm\u2019s legal issues \u2014 sensing a theme here? \u2014 led to resignation and Donovan\u2019s election.\n\nThrough all of this, Democrats have been non-competitive in the district save for McMahon\u2019s surprising and short-lived victory. That\u2019s what makes Rose\u2019s win all the more worthy of greater notice.\n\nRose, an Army veteran of Afghanistan, was on Lawrence O\u2019Donnell\u2019s show, \u201cThe Last Word,\u201d on MSNBC last night, and he did not focus on Donald Trump or collusion or immigration \u2014 nothing that would excite the party\u2019s base. Instead, he told O\u2019Donnell that he was more concerned about \u2014 wait for it \u2014 better bus service on Staten Island and a more reliable R train in Brooklyn. \u201cSolving problems is what matters,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question is whether he\u2019ll find his voice in a House that's sure to be among the most contentious in memory. \u2014 Terry Golway\n\nIT\u2019S FRIDAY.

The program allows about 700,000 young immigrants to stay and work in the United States.

With Amazon reportedly poised to announce it will locate one of its two new headquarters in New York City, some experts are wondering why the state seems prepared to heavily subsidize that decision when its fellow tech behemoths have come to the city without similarly lucrative enticements. Google on Wednesday told the Wall Street Journal it has taken no state subsidies to aid its rapid growth in New York City. Facebook on Thursday told POLITICO the same...After the news broke that Amazon is inclined to split its new headquarters between Crystal City, in Northern Virginia, and Long Island City, Queens, Cuomo began to hint at the size of the subsidy package to come...The governor is fond of using state subsidies to incentivize job growth, even if his record at achieving that growth is spotty .

The city writes fines for everything from building-code violations to mixing recyclables with garbage. Most of these are never paid. As of October 2017, the city was due $1.5 billion in outstanding violations.

Michelle Obama hits Chicago next week to promote her book. The book reveals new information about her life, including that she used IVF to conceive. Story here\n\nTHE BUZZ\n\nGov. Bruce Rauner faces another tough week. On Tuesday, lawmakers turn their attention to Springfield for a veto session taking up bills the governor rejected over the summer. One of those is a bipartisan measure extending regulations for car-sharing operators like Turo. The bill would impose regulations similar to those in place for rental-car companies. A source close to lobbying efforts says an override of that bill is expected when the veto session starts.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhat it would mean: Lawmakers on both sides are ready to move on without Rauner. This car-sharing bill is an easy first step for Democrats and Republicans as they feel out their new world with a Democrat moving into the governor's seat. The bill addresses bipartisan ideals: consumer protection and taxation. An override could signal trouble for Rauner on more controversial measures as D\u2019s and R\u2019s start feeling comfortable seeing eye-to-eye on things while the governor operates in lame duck status.\n\nMORE BUZZ\n\nTurns out Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle knew for months that her former chief of staff was at the center of a sexual assault incident. She told POLITICO she couldn\u2019t do anything about it at the time. \"In March, I received an unsubstantiated rumor. No victim came forward, and there was nothing I could act on. In September, I received an allegation that was corroborated, and I acted immediately,\u201d Preckwinkle said in a statement.\n\nThe Tribune has documents and a story saying Preckwinkle was told in March about an incident involving John Keller. She fired him six months later. Keller\u2019s tenure is being investigated by the Office of Independent Inspector General.\n\nThe victim is a friend of Emily Miller, a Democratic political consultant who told a Preckwinkle aide about the assault last spring, according to the Trib. Miller then followed up with Preckwinkle because she was concerned about how the matter was handled.\n\nThere\u2019s another layer of drama in this story. The day before the Trib piece was published, Sun-Times Columnist Mike Sneed reported Miller was working for Susana Mendoza\u2019s mayoral campaign\u2014which hasn\u2019t been formally announced. But that information isn\u2019t quite right. Miller supports Mendoza (judging by her Twitter page) but she doesn\u2019t work for her. She actually was a consultant for J.B. Pritzker in his run for governor.\n\nReporters don\u2019t reveal sources, but political wonks are pointing fingers at the misinformation.

Every incumbent who voted for the controversial measure was reelected, and sponsors of the HB4114 to repeal HB40 were defeated. They are state Reps. Peter Breen, Christine Winger and Sheri Jesiel. Breen\u2019s defeat was particularly shocking. Along with being had been an outspoken opponent of HB40, which repealed the \u201ctrigger\u201d language in Illinois stating that the day Roe v. Wade is ever modified or overturned, abortion would be illegal in Illinois with no exceptions. HB40 also removed the restriction on state funding for some abortions. After the bill passed and was signed by the governor, Breen filed suit to dismantle the legislation. Personal PAC, which supports abortion rights, spent more than $300,000 to unseat Breen, \u201cand it was worth every penny,\u201d Terry Cosgrove, president and CEO of Personal PAC told POLITICO, calling it one of the political action committee\u2019s \u201cbiggest victories ever.\u201d\n\nAnother big victory was in 1992, when pro-life Republican leader State Rep.

Two employees of the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation, speaking on condition of anonymity over fears of losing their jobs, claimed that senior administrators delayed sending kids to the hospital \u2014 even as many started dying.

They promised to use their newfound leverage to somehow prod the Trump administration to finance the stalled Gateway rail and tunnel project. And instead of vowing to wage a political jihad on Trump in the run-up to his 2020 reelection, the New Jersey newcomers see an opportunity to negotiate with Trump and the (small) bloc of Republican moderates in the Senate to stabilize health insurance and prescription costs.\u201d Read the report\n\nAND YOU WOULDN\u2019T HAVE BEEN CALLED RACIST IF YOU DIDN\u2019T POST RACIST STUFF \u2014 \u201cI would have won if people didn't call me a racist, GOP House candidate says,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Chris Franklin and Bill Gallor Jr.: \u201cHis was a campaign with little money and scant support from state and national Republican leaders, but Seth Grossman made an unexpectedly strong showing in the race to fill New Jersey's Second Congressional District seat. He says it was a campaign he could have been a victor in. \u2018There's no doubt in my mind that if I did not have unnecessary distractions thrown into my path I would have won yesterday's election as a pro-Trump candidate because this is a pro-Trump district,\u2019 Grossman said Wednesday. ... Grossman stuck to his conservative message saying he was needed in the House to help carry forward President Donald J. Trump's agenda. He said it was Democrat mischief that spread word he had forwarded via Facebook an article from a group known for promoting pro-white nationalist content. \u2018I was distracted trying to prove I'm not a racist,\u2019 he said.

Michael Puzio is the newly elected mayor, but perhaps it will take some time before residents get that right. In August, longtime Mayor Michael Dachisen died from a heart attack, said his family. The day after his death, Council President Jeremy Jedynak became the acting mayor. His term was only good for 30 days. At the end of that term, and in the midst of some local political drama, the council named Paul Minenna interim mayor.

Approximately two thirds of the water samples tested by the city last month and submitted to the state Department of Environmental Protection showed lead levels in excess of the 15 parts per billion federal limit, according to state data. Three of the 32 samples exceeded 50 parts per billion, more than three times the legal limit. The latest results come as city officials face growing scrutiny over their response to the potential public health crisis. The city has repeatedly declared its water is \u201cabsolutely safe\u201d to drink and is \u201csome of the best water in the state of New Jersey,\u201d despite being cited by the DEP for lead contamination three times since 2017.

As a former head of the European Space Agency\u2019s human spaceflight program, she is also encouraging more pooling of international resources to help power new human exploration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDi Pippo\u2019s office has recently orchestrated a way for companies or agencies from non-space faring nations to send experiments into orbit on a space plane built by Sierra Nevada Corporation and to conduct scientific research on the Chinese space station after it begins operating in the early 2020s.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of change of attitude,\u201d she says. \u201cMember states gave the UN the [permission] to start working more with the private sector, with a lot of caveats.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Space POLITICO\u2019s weekly must-read briefing on the second space age.

Di Pippo insists the UN's treaty work is \"still valid,\" but acknowledges that the documents need to be updated to reflect today's landscape.\n\n\u201cA lot has happened,\u201d she explains. \u201cA lot of technologies were developed...and now they are very useful for the developing and flourishing of the commercial side of space\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview, Di Pippo also spoke about ways to increase cooperation on human exploration missions, the desire of non-space faring nations to launch space programs of their own, and concerns about a propsed U.S. Space Force and a greater militarization of space.\n\nThis transcript has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\"Member states gave the UN the [permission] to start working more with the private sector, with a lot of caveats,\" said Simonetta Di Pippo, Director of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. | Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat role should the United Nations have in solving the problem of orbital debris?\n\nThe role of the UN, at least the Office of Outer Space Affairs, is really to try to build bridges and...bring all the players and the stakeholders together so that all are part of the process of defining...the future. It can sound generic, but in reality, [it is] what we try to do.\n\n[We] act on the basis of what member states decide. It\u2019s the member states decision. But we try to bring...the private sector or civil society to the table so we can really grasp their needs. Because if we don\u2019t understand in detail their needs, it\u2019s also difficult for us to try to drive the discussion towards the right guidelines.\n\nWe have...agenda items [that we discuss] in the meetings for the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Member states report on their activities in the various fields. It\u2019s also a way for them to develop cooperation in trying to work on the various topics.\n\nWhat are the other major areas of focus?\n\nWe are working a lot on space weather. We are working on planetary protection. We are working on exploration...We work on how to use space-based data for disaster risk reduction and emergency response.\n\nWhat we do essentially is capacity building and training mainly focusing on developing and emerging countries in general. We try to use this triangular approach where we are helping developed and developing countries to get together because this is a way of doing capacity building. When you bring a developed, space-faring nation into a project with a developing country, they can get a lot from this collaboration. We facilitate these connections.\n\nDoes the UN need to work on new rules of the road for space?\n\nWhat is...under discussion in the UN\u2026[is] a revision of the current legal regime...because the treaties are really still valid.\n\nIn the meantime, [the] space [program] is quite young...but a lot has happened. A lot of technologies were developed...and now they are very useful for the developing and flourishing of the commercial side of space...This is because a lot of money has been spent by the government, so this is now allowing companies to put themselves forward...with a lot of innovation.\n\nIn Vienna and here in New York...everything is reached by member agreements and decisions are taken by consensus. So you have long discussions and reach an agreement by consensus, then all the members states which participated in the discussion, they follow their own decisions...Even if it\u2019s not a treaty...is not binding...but it\u2019s a voluntary commitment to follow certain guidelines that they approved by consensus, they follow...The system is very solid.\n\nIs the UN\u2019s role changing as the private space sector grows?\n\nThere\u2019s been a little bit of change of attitude starting in the end of 2015, when the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was approved. The agenda is based on 17 sustainable development goals. One of them, number 17, is partnerships...It\u2019s addressing the needs of working more with civil society and the private sector.\n\nMember states gave the UN the [permission] to start working more with the private sector, with a lot of caveats. We obviously have to pay a lot of attention to the kind of industry we're dealing with. We always warn them to abide by the UN core values. They need to demonstrate very strong corporate social responsibility.\n\nIn the case of the Office for Outer Space Affairs, we have a few examples...not only [in the] private sector, but also space agencies offering donations in kind or the possibility to launch free of charge cubesats or using slots on the space station.\n\nDo the priorities of private companies and member states differ?\n\nNo...when we start a project...we usually know in which way we can deal with company A or company B. We don\u2019t have overlaps, so we usually work with companies that have very specific products.\n\nFor example, we\u2019re working with Sierra Nevada Corporation, which is developing the DreamChaser, [to send experiments from non-space faring nations into space.] It\u2019s a unique vehicle. We work with Digital Globe in the United States, now Maxar Technologies...on high resolution images. We recently signed an agreement with Airbus, a European company, and they\u2019re offering some slots free of charge on a facility they are developing on a commercial basis for the International Space Station. So that\u2019s the approach: unique facilities, with unique offers.\n\nAre more developing space nations wanting to get involved in space?\n\nYeah. For example, with the Dream Chaser...Last year, we issued a call for interest, [which] was up on our website for six weeks, so not a long period of time...We received 150 proposals from 75 countries. This was a very good sign that the idea was good.\n\nYou have to consider the mission...will be fully focusing on experiments linked to the 17 sustainable development goals I mentioned before, which means it will be the only space mission in the world linked to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development\u2026.Every proposal has a minimum [of] one, but in a few cases two or three [sustainable development goals.]...So there are many interesting proposals there from the 75 countries.\n\nWhat are the biggest roadblocks to improving cooperation on human exploration?\n\nThis is one of the topics that we are starting to discuss right now. There are already some coordination mechanisms...between space faring nations...There is [an existing group] where you have 15 space agencies already working on a roadmap for exploration. The idea is to enlarge this so everyone can contribute...This is a process that we started a couple of years ago\u2026[and is] what we have to do for the future...in order to have an open and inclusive open architecture for exploration of the solar system.\n\nAre you concerned about geopolitical conflicts on Earth extending to space?\n\nWhat I\u2019m seeing is that, in terms of operational relationships, everything works very well...The UN champion for space is a former NASA astronaut Scott Kelly. He\u2019s now in his third year with us as the champion for space. He is famous for a lot of reasons, but one of the reasons is because he spent one year on the space station..He was in this one year mission with a Russian colleague, [Mikhail Korniyenko]...Scott refers to Korniyenko as his brother from another mother, which means that they became so close, they act like brothers.\n\nThis happens for every crew on board the space station...because you have to develop a very good relationship independent of your age, your culture, your region, your gender, whatever. Because at the very end, what you do in space and your life is linked to what the others do. So it must really be a family.\n\nThen operationally also you have control centers...in Japan, Russia, Europe, the United States. They have to work all together at the same time. You have thousands of people on Earth working together. So it\u2019s not only what you see on the space station [where] you have six astronauts of different nationalities. Yes, it\u2019s already a really good, visible and tangible effect of this collaboration. But on ground, you have a lot of technicians, supporting [the crew] day-by-day, minute-by-minute together.\n\nHow are member states responding to American plans for a military Space Force?\n\nWe deal with the peaceful uses of outer space. What we do is...develop coordination mechanisms and measures which can help transparency and can help build confidence and trust. So what we really do [is] we try to bring everyone to the table and try to open up.\n\nFor example, this collaboration we have...with the Chinese space agency. We had a joint announcement of an opportunity through which the China space station [currently being developed] was opened to everyone in the world for utilization...We\u2019re starting the technical evaluation of those proposals [for experiments onboard the station]...[When the station is] up and running in 2021 [or] 2022, we expect to have...the experiments ready.\n\nIt\u2019s an example. We have plenty of them, but just to say, there is really through us this attempt also from member states to be more open, more transparent and more cooperative.\n\nSo you\u2019re not seeing any member states pull back from that because of the U.S.?\n\nNo. There\u2019s a lot of discussion, but this is the place for discussion. It\u2019s exactly the value of what we do: creating the place for diplomatic discussion.", "Protesters rally in front of the White House in March 2017. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT Judge tosses Trump\u2019s Keystone XL approval over climate change\n\nA federal judge ordered both the Trump administration and TransCanada to stop any work on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline on Thursday, saying President Donald Trump\u2019s approval of the project last year violated several key environmental and administrative laws by ignoring facts about climate change.\n\nJudge Brian Morris of the U.S. District Court for Montana ruled that the Trump administration almost completely ignored climate change in its analysis supporting the pipeline\u2019s construction, a shift that unlawfully reversed the Obama administration\u2019s 2015 decision rejecting the pipeline\u2019s cross-border permit.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMorris, an Obama appointee, directed the Trump administration in his ruling to prepare a new environmental study before the pipeline can resume construction, leaving the door open to a renewed approval in the future.\n\n\u201cThe [State] Department did not merely make a policy shift in its stance on the United States\u2019 role on climate change.

DAVID MCKINLEY, who handily won re-election, asked the leadership why Republicans aren\u2019t planning immediate action on a bill that guarantees health care to people with pre-existing conditions. He noted that this was a major election-season issue. SPEAKER PAUL RYAN said the bill they passed in 2017 did ensure coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, and doing so now would be a false concession -- in his mind -- that the initial bill fell short in that regard.\n\n-- TWO SOUTHERN lawmakers -- Florida Rep. Neal Dunn and Georgia Rep. Austin Scott -- said Congress needs to pass an emergency disaster spending bill to help clean up from the hurricane.\n\n-- REP.

Democrats will lead in the 116th Congress and I will support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker.

Republicans are going to push for a full year of funding for the remaining spending bills, which includes DHS -- and, presumably the wall. This would give Congress the ability to get a fresh start on spending in 2019. But Democrats have to go along with that plan -- and they may see it to their advantage to enact a short-term bill so they can negotiate immigration and border security language on their terms.\n\nBUT Republicans and Democrats will need to negotiate a new budget deal next year, and the GOP believes that a short-term spending deal might delay those talks.\n\n-- THAT ALL SAID \u2026 NEW YORK REP.

This is an era of weakened parties, and much of the financial and strategic air-cover for candidates across the country was provided by the biggest outside organizations: Kelly\u2019s House Majority PAC, allied with Democrats, and Bliss\u2019 Congressional Leadership Fund, allied with Republicans.\n\nBoth super PACs are allowed to bring in unlimited sums of campaign cash\u2014and they did. The Congressional Leadership Fund raised and spent roughly $160 million for the election, while House Majority PAC and its partner organization, Patriot Majority, raised and spent roughly $113 million. As the executive directors of their respective organizations, Bliss and Kelly were engaged in a high-stakes political chess match, moving millions of dollars around the map supporting\u2014and attacking\u2014candidates in the country\u2019s tightest races.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe House GOP was destined to play defense in 2018: A first-term president\u2019s party loses an average of 32 seats in the midterm election, and Donald Trump\u2019s polarizing tenure sparked a groundswell of energy and money in the Democratic base. \u201cThe last time we did this, the first midterm of an incumbent president in 2010, we picked up 63 seats,\u201d Bliss said. \u201cSo history said this was going to be a tough environment. Throw in 40-plus retirements\u2014and throw in the green wave with $100 million from Michael Bloomberg on top\u2014and you\u2019re going to create a very tough map and a very tough environment.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats, some of the obvious targets represented upscale, traditionally Republican suburbs where Trump has proved toxic. But they were also able to stretch the GOP\u2019s resources by competing in certain rural districts where the president is popular. Kelly called this a \u201cparallel track strategy,\u201d and it rested on a fundamental advantage: Many Republican incumbents\u2014due to gerrymandering, demographic changes or both\u2014had no experience running a tough race. \u201cTotally caught flat-footed, not prepared to run a modern campaign,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

What follows is a conversation\u2014spliced from those interviews\u2014about how the House was won, what the results tell us about the country\u2019s political, cultural and geographic divisions and where Congress goes from here.\n\n(Note: The interviews are condensed for brevity. District numbers and party affiliations are added for clarity.)\n\n\n\n***\n\nALBERTA: I want to talk about the biggest surprises of the election cycle. Charlie, what was the most pleasant surprise for you? A race that you weren\u2019t necessarily expecting to win, but when it came on the board for Democrats, you were thrilled.\n\nKELLY: Upstate New York I was watching very, very closely. Super encouraged by [Democrat] Anthony Brindisi in New York-22. That\u2019s one of the places where we invested starting in April on our paid media efforts and over the course of the summer, ran a digital program there. And then obviously, in the fall, right around Labor Day and on, we were on TV almost throughout.\n\nALBERTA: And that\u2019s a district where Trump has been pretty popular.\n\nKELLY: Yeah, he is. In the data that we saw, he was probably a plus-10 or -12 job performance. The generic ballot was not in our favor there. I think people, if they were to say, \u201cWell, the generic is in your favor everywhere,\u201d it was not in Upstate New York, certainly in Central New York. He overperformed and I think the contrast that we outlined early on to help disqualify [Republican incumbent Claudia] Tenney was really, really important. Health care-oriented, increase in premiums, the age tax, the fact that the tax plan increased the debt and to pay for it, cutting Medicare and Social Security. Powerful arguments, things that we\u2019ve seen nationally. But those were focused there.\n\nALBERTA: Corry, before we lay too much blame on the president, you did have some districts where Donald Trump is pretty popular. And I\u2019m thinking specifically up in the Hudson Valley with Tenney and John Faso [Republican, N.Y.-19], two incumbents who, despite Trump\u2019s standing in their districts, could not get across the finish line.\n\nFour of the incumbent Republican House members who lost on Tuesday. Clockwise, from top left: Florida Congressman Carlos Curbelo; upstate New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney, campaigning with Eric Trump; Staten Island Republican Dan Donovan; Congressman John Faso, who represents a large part of New York\u2019s Hudson Valley. | AP; Getty Images\n\nBLISS: In this environment, if you get outraised 3-to-1, 4-to-1, if you wait until the last four months to try really hard, you are asking for trouble. In those two districts, President Trump is plus-10, plus-15; they were only close because of President Trump. Candidates and campaigns matter.\n\nALBERTA: A lot.\n\nBLISS: A lot. And the tougher the year, the more it matters. One person who I think ran a perfect campaign and lost by a nose is Carlos Curbelo [Fla.-26] I think Curbelo ran a great race, worked hard, raised money, was in tune with the district, and he lost by a little bit over a point in a district that Hillary Clinton [won] by 16. But it wasn\u2019t enough, and that\u2019s very disappointing because I think he deserved to win.\n\nKELLY: Curbelo was a surprise. We saw the trend line upwards towards the end. But winning two seats out of Miami-Dade County, I think, is extraordinary.\n\nBLISS: On the other side, if we\u2019re being honest, there were a couple members of Congress who didn\u2019t raise enough money, who didn\u2019t start early enough, who I guess didn\u2019t work hard enough. You know, Steve Russell [Republican, Okla.-05] raised about a million dollars for the cycle. You know, Dan Donovan [Republican, N.Y.-11] raised almost no money after the primary. And those were races\u2014in the world of the green wave where Michael Bloomberg puts $2 million into Oklahoma at the end, where Dan Donovan\u2019s opponent outspent him about 10-to-1 on TV, if you\u2019re not prepared, if you don\u2019t start early, if you don\u2019t raise money in the off year, if you don\u2019t put our campaign together in the off-year, in this environment you can get caught at the wire.\n\nIf we\u2019re being honest, there were a couple members of Congress who \u2026 didn\u2019t work hard enough.\u201d Corry Bliss\n\nKELLY: The true surprises were South Carolina-01 and Oklahoma-05. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say about those two: Heading into Election Day, South Carolina-01, we actually had survey data that had us down a couple. One of our partner groups, 314 Action was big in that race, and they\u2019ve done a lot of sort of paid-media work. We saw that two-thirds of the African-American voters were undecided at that point. We felt if they broke the way we expected them to break that we could actually potentially pick up that race and that\u2019s one where the strategy is lie in wait and see what happens.\n\nALBERTA: Don\u2019t draw too much attention to it.\n\nKELLY: Exactly, And then Oklahoma-05, the Bloomberg folks were on the case there. They sort of said, \u201cLook, we\u2019ll take a flyer here and see what the reality is.\u201d And obviously, it played out.\n\nALBERTA: Charlie, what about the unpleasant surprises? Give me a couple of races you were really feeling optimistic about, and they just didn\u2019t quite get across the finish line.\n\nKELLY: Kansas-02. I think Paul Davis is an exceptional public servant. I think he\u2019s in it for the right reasons. He\u2019s a terrific guy. I thought that he would sneak that one out. I expected Paul Davis to come to Congress, so that\u2019s a tough one. Minnesota-01 with Dan Feehan. I\u2019m from Minnesota. I thought that we would potentially hold that Walz seat. I think some of the doom and gloom stuff at the end of the cycle that the Republicans sort of relied on kind of snuck up and caught Feehan. There\u2019s still potential there, there\u2019s a recount. But at this point, that one looks tough.\n\nALBERTA: Corry, what were the pleasant surprises for you? What was the race that in your heart of hearts you were counting out for Republicans, that they wound up winning?\n\nBLISS: I\u2019m really surprised and I\u2019m really happy that we won [Republican] Brian Fitzpatrick\u2019s race in Pennsylvania-01. That was a tough district; that\u2019s a Hillary Clinton district. He ran against a self-funder. He was outspent by almost $4 million. He ran a great campaign focused on local issues from the water well to the opioid epidemic. And we were proud to help him. We were proud to play a big role in the two seats we picked up in Minnesota. Pete Stauber [Republican, Minn.-08], we knocked on almost 500,000 doors there, and we were the biggest spender in that race. Jim Hagedorn [Republican, Minn.-01] we spent significant resources on his race. Mimi Walters [Republican, Calif.-45] ran a great campaign, won a very tough race in a tough district. She was outspent by almost $3 million. Young Kim [Republican, Calif.-39] was one of our biggest expenditures in Orange County. I think she will be a future superstar of the party, the first Korean-American woman ever elected to Congress. [Note: Tens of thousands of ballots remain to be counted in these California races, leaving the outcomes in doubt.]\n\nIf you get to create this image of a nonpartisan, bipartisan mom or dad with three cute little kids and you\u2019re just going to save the world\u2014and, oh, P.S. before you decided to come save the world, you spent a couple of years in the Middle East blowing up terrorists\u2014you\u2019re going to win. Corry Bliss\n\nALBERTA: There were a lot of great Democratic recruits that benefited from Republican incumbents being asleep at the switch. In the two Texas races, the 32nd District and the 7th District, where these Republican incumbents, John Culberson in the Houston area and Pete Sessions in the Dallas area, these guys had not faced a tough election in long time\u2014if ever.\n\nKELLY: In Texas-32, Colin Allred ran a spectacular campaign.\n\nALBERTA: You told me you thought he might be the best recruit of the entire cycle.\n\nKELLY: Oh, there\u2019s no question. He\u2019s been successful. Everything he touches is gold\u2014from his career as a professional football player, his work as an attorney. Again, he has a record of success in the community. He won a very contested primary, and then he ran a very tough runoff so he was sort of battle-hardened for the general election. Sessions didn\u2019t take it seriously. These districts, too, in both Texas-32 and Texas-7, they\u2019ve changed so much under the incumbents\u2019 feet. It\u2019s much more diverse in both of them. Beto O\u2019Rourke helped, and the surge around his campaign was big and that obviously, pushed us over, probably.\n\nBLISS: And the Democrats deserve credit. They did a great job with hard-dollar, small-dollar fundraising that helped their candidates get on TV early, start earlier than ever before. There were a number of these races that if we didn\u2019t win August, it wouldn\u2019t matter who was going to win October because the Democrats had record amounts of money and they did a good job recruiting good stories and good candidates. In this environment, if you get to create this image of a nonpartisan, bipartisan mom or dad with three cute little kids and you\u2019re just going to save the world\u2014and, oh, P.S., before you decided to come save the world, you spent a couple of years in the Middle East blowing up terrorists\u2014you\u2019re going to win. It doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re running or who you\u2019re running against.\n\nALBERTA: Someone who fits that profile is Elissa Slotkin [Democrat, Mich.-08), a former CIA analyst who upset Republican incumbent Mike Bishop. Charlie, talk about the quality of the Democratic recruits\u2014not just in the abstract, but as a fit for their districts. In the Midwest and in Trump-friendly parts of the country, these candidates went out of their way throughout the campaign to triangulate against what could be perceived as a Democratic Party nationally that might be moving too far left. And they were very intentional in these campaigns to present themselves not as partisan firebrands but as pragmatic, thoughtful individuals. How difficult is it, in an environment like this, for candidates to thread that needle?\n\nFour incoming Democratic freshmen House members who flipped seats previously held by Republicans. Clockwise, from upper left: Texas Congressman-elect Colin Allred; Michigan Congresswoman-elect Elissa Slotkin; New York Congressman-elect Antonio Delgado; Michigan Congresswoman-elect Haley Stevens. | AP\n\nKELLY: I think that that was the message from the top. I mean, these are common sense leaders in their communities who want to get things done. And I think whether it\u2019s in Michigan, Elissa Slotkin or Haley Stevens [Democrat, Mich.-11]. Whether you\u2019re talking about Upstate New York, across the Midwest, even out to California. These folks have had success in their professional fields and a diverse array of professional fields. And heading to Congress, what they want to do is they want to pursue an agenda that works to lift up the middle class. That\u2019s the unifier. That\u2019s when we\u2019ve had the most success as the Democratic Party.\n\nALBERTA: Let\u2019s talk about the suburbs. Across the map last night, from Detroit to Chicago to Philly to New York to Washington to Houston to Oklahoma City to Los Angeles, you\u2019ve got Republicans hemorrhaging support in the suburbs. Corry, where do you see that trend taking the party and what adjustments need to be made in order to prevent long-term damage?\n\nBLISS: Almost every race is winnable. There are very few races that are not winnable, and I think candidates and campaigns really, really matter. Look at a couple of the winners from last night. Mimi Walters ran a tremendous campaign focused on what she has accomplished for her constituents from legislation to get rid of sex trafficking, to going home every weekend and selling tax reform. And that\u2019s a very tough district, a very affluent, educated district. Brian Fitzpatrick in Bucks County, Pa., a district that Hillary Clinton won. He did a great job, focused on local issues, put a diverse coalition together, and he won by a comfortable margin. So candidates and campaigns matter. In some races there\u2019s other factors that play in, sometimes the top of the ticket. The top of the ticket in Illinois certainly didn\u2019t help Peter Roskam [Republican, Ill.-06]. It certainly didn\u2019t help Randy Hultgren [Republican, Ill.-14].\n\nYes, we struggled in districts that Hillary Clinton won, but if we have good candidates who run strong campaigns, we have every opportunity to win almost all those seats back in two years.\n\nALBERTA: As we\u2019re seeing many of these affluent, white-collar, college-educated suburbanites moving towards the Democratic Party, it\u2019s happening the other way around with blue collar, middle class and working-class voters moving toward the Republican Party. Republicans are concerned about losing those suburbs, Charlie, but what level of concern should Democrats have about these exurban and rural areas that were once your party\u2019s stronghold?\n\nKELLY: Early on in this cycle, I always believed that we had an opportunity in these noncollege or sort of working-class districts. A lot of them have Democratic DNA. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve done two cycles working with the steelworkers and others in legally permissible ways. They started, I think through US Works, a long-term research program years ago to better understand sort of some of the challenges facing Democrats broadly in some of these noncollege districts, more rural and exurban districts. We\u2019ve clearly had challenges for cultural and economic reasons over the last couple of cycles. But when you make an economic case to these voters, the kitchen-table stuff, you can have success. Iowa-01, which went for Trump in 2016, we had success with [Democrat] Abby Finkenauer, her labor background, she did a terrific job. [Democrat] Cindy Axne in Iowa-3, which is southwestern Iowa from Des Moines to Omaha, we won that district as well. There were a number of places we were competitive last night that Trump did well in 2016. I think we\u2019ll continue to be competitive. We just need to make the economic case. I will double down on these districts because I believe for us to have a national party, a party of success, we need to be competitive everywhere and make the economic appeal. Because again, when we\u2019re at our best, we\u2019re making that appeal.\n\nALBERTA: And part of the success for Democrats in those areas was not going after Trump.\n\nKELLY: The Trump stuff is baked in. We know that. Our research suggests it. The chaos, the noise in Washington\u2014people are used to it for whatever reason. But beyond that, it\u2019s, \u201cWhat are you doing for me?\u201d That\u2019s what folks are saying in these communities. The Democratic candidates spoke to that. And a lot of the noise from the Republican side, a lot of the doom and gloom stuff, I think fell flat. They pursued a scattershot message strategy. They said they\u2019re going to run on taxes; they didn\u2019t. They moved on in [Pennsylvania Democrat] Conor Lamb\u2019s race quickly to immigration and then they moved on to him being weak on crime, etc. It didn\u2019t work. It played out in other races as well. They had a \u201ckill them in the cradle\u201d strategy at the beginning of August that largely fell flat. For a couple of races that may have had marginal success, but those were sort of self-inflicted wounds that the Democrats had.\n\nALBERTA: Kentucky-06, for example.\n\nKELLY: Yeah. And maybe Ohio-01, the mistakes made.\n\nALBERTA: Republicans would say they played a role in taking down those Democratic candidates, using their self-inflicted wounds against them.\n\nBLISS: Kentucky-06 was the first race we went on TV in July. After the primary our first survey had [Democrat] Amy McGrath\u2019s image at 53-14 and she was leading by 13 points on the ballot. One of the reasons why we had to go on TV in July was she raised $8.5 million dollars. One of the reasons why CLF had to go on TV in the first week of August in Cincinnati for [Republican] Steve Chabot [Ohio-01], he was running against a first-time opponent. We had that race tied. His opponent basically had unlimited money and was going to be on TV any day. That there was a number of these races that I think CLF played a big role in winning.\n\nKELLY: But against Jared Golden [Democrat, Maine-02], they put him in tattoos. It didn\u2019t work. [NOTE: The Maine-02 race is in a recount.] They attempted the same thing in New York-19. It completely fell flat, really sort of a silly argument made against [Democrat Anthony] Delgado. They attempted it in Kansas-03 against [Democrat] Sharice Davids. It fell flat. She had a lead throughout. Time and time again, their sort of strategy\u2014again, all over the place, throw anything against the wall\u2014but none of it really worked.\n\nALBERTA: One thing that did work, early on, was tying Democrats to Nancy Pelosi. We saw that in the Georgia-06 special election, Corry, where Republicans spent $18 million to hold that seat in the Atlanta suburbs, a district Trump had carried by 23 points, because of the symbolic value. And you told me afterwards, \u201cWe won the battle, but we may have lost the war.\u201d\n\nBLISS: That special election seems like it was 20 years ago.\n\nALBERTA: Yes, it does.\n\nBLISS: We learned a couple lessons in Georgia-06. No. 1, it was astronomical how much [Democrat] Jon Ossoff raised. I mean, Jon Ossoff basically was just a kid who lived in his parents\u2019 basement who raised $30 million on the internet. One of the moments I\u2019ll always remember is the first report came out, and I believe he had raised $8.5 million, and I looked on Twitter and said, \u201cThis has to be a typo. Jon Ossoff sitting in his underwear in his parents\u2019 basement raised $8.5 million in a month?\u201d But that taught us the green wave is coming. We won, but we did such a good job attacking, defining and beating Jon Ossoff, maybe we did too good of a job. Because it was all about tying him to Pelosi\u2014San Francisco money, San Francisco liberal values. It basically provided a road map to a lot of candidates: Study Jon Ossoff and do the opposite. Conor Lamb, who is a much better candidate than Jon Ossoff, you could tell that he had studied Jon Ossoff very closely and decided just to do the opposite. So we won the battle, it may have hurt us in the war. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. At the time, we had to win that race.\n\nKELLY: Our counterpart wasted a ton of money on what I call \u201caway games\u201d for us in special elections. Tens of millions of dollars. We come into the last nine weeks, and they expect, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve had an advantage throughout, we\u2019re going to have one throughout.\u201d Not at all. And I think that was really, really important.\n\nBLISS: My job is to do the best that I can do with what I can control, and that is raise as much money as possible. Thanks to Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, CLF was able to raise and spend $160 million, which was a big deal because of one of the tactical challenges we faced with the green wave. I think there\u2019s a case to be made that if it wasn\u2019t for CLF raising $160 million, being able to compete in 52 races, helping spread Democrat money across the country, that we could have lost upwards of 50 seats last night.\n\nKELLY: On the Democratic independent-expenditure front, we raised and spent record amounts here at House Majority PAC. We had 400,000 unique contributions, $113 million approximately between us and our C4 partner, Patriot Majority. But the partnership and leveraging the sort of resources and the strategic way among the IE progressive partners\u2014Independence USA, folks in the environmental community, labor, Emily\u2019s List\u2014was exceptional. Over $200 million this cycle. And I think we really surprised the other side.\n\nWe laid in wait until Labor Day. You sort of picture \u2026 Braveheart: \u201cHold, hold, and then boom.\u201d Charlie Kelly\n\nALBERTA: They\u2019re not used to being outspent.\n\nKELLY: They\u2019re not used to being outspent. And we laid in wait until Labor Day. You sort of picture that, what is it in Braveheart: \u201cHold, hold, and then boom.\u201d Come Labor Day, the last nine weeks, we let them have it. We outspent the other side in 90 percent of the districts, the competitive districts for the last nine weeks.\n\nBLISS: If there\u2019s one thing I really wish we could have done, I wish we could have figured out a way to have convinced Michael Bloomberg to give us the $100 million and not the Democrats, and that would have really helped win a whole bunch of seats. You know, in almost every race we were outspent\u2014in 45 out of 52 races CLF participated in\u2014we were outspent by an average of almost $2 million.\n\nALBERTA: And Charlie, as you watched the National Republican Congressional Committee dump $5 million into Republican Barbara Comstock\u2019s race in Virginia-11\u2014even as it was clear that she was not going to be able to win reelection\u2014what are you thinking to yourself?\n\nKELLY: Silliness. What a waste of money. We saw [Democrat Jennifer] Wexton up 16 points in July. We polled there every week to make sure because we ended up canceling our television time, and we saw that she was consistently down double digits. They just kept spending money. It was a giant waste of money. They did it, actually, in a couple of places, and I have no idea why. Colorado-06 is another place.\n\nALBERTA: I want to close by discussing where the Democratic Party goes from here. There are some parallels between 2010 and 2018, with the incumbent president\u2019s party facing a backlash from the grassroots of the other party. The one thing I reflect on is how, in 2010, many of those Republican challengers were framing themselves as independent-minded, and saying they wanted to push back on the Republican establishment, and saying they didn\u2019t trust either party. But then a lot of them, once they came to Congress, turned into fierce partisans. Charlie, how concerned should Democrats be that once these folks come to D.C. and find themselves in this environment\u2014with a Trump-driven news cycle, everything up to Level 10 every single day\u2014that they will get sucked into that vortex and not stay true to the independent brands that were so effective for them during the campaigns?\n\nKELLY: I think these people had real records of success before running for Congress. I said before, this is the most credentialed group of recruits in a generation. These are problem-solvers inherently. These are common-sense leaders. These are independent-minded folks. They\u2019re going to do I think the right work for those sorts of districts and the work that they feel is of importance to the constituents that they represent.\n\nBLISS: Basically, in every tough race in America, the Democrat campaigned against Pelosi and really against the Democratic Party. I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of new members of Congress who won yesterday, and in a year their constituents will be very surprised and very disappointed to learn they\u2019re actually Democrats. Because a lot of the candidates ran as kind of nonpartisan, bipartisan parents who were just going to come here and save the world, and they didn\u2019t know who Nancy Pelosi was and they\u2019ve never met her, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t vote for her. And I think a lot of their constituents are going to be very disappointed to see what they do when they get here.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, the frontrunner to be the next speaker of the House. | Getty Images\n\nALBERTA: All eyes will be on the new Democratic majority in the coming weeks as they elect their leaders. You had several dozen Democratic candidates across the country saying that they would not support Nancy Pelosi for speaker, and obviously, this is where the going gets tough What do you expect to happen, Charlie? Do you think Nancy Pelosi will be the speaker?\n\nKELLY: Yes, I do. Nancy Pelosi was a terrific speaker. She\u2019s going to be a terrific speaker again, and she has done extraordinary work for the American public. There\u2019s no question about that.\n\nALBERTA: But will there be a backlash for candidates? How do they get away with voting for her?\n\nKELLY: At the end of the day, look, I know that Nancy Pelosi did a great job as speaker. She\u2019ll do a great job going forward. She\u2019s committed to the\u2014focused on lifting up the middle class, individuals across this country providing economic opportunity, education, infrastructure investments and doing it the right way.\n\nBLISS: Nancy Pelosi is the most unpopular, polarizing politician in American politics, period, end of discussion.\n\nALBERTA: More so than Trump?\n\nBLISS: Absolutely. Absolutely.\n\nALBERTA: I want to crunch the numbers on this.\n\nBLISS: I think every Republican hopes she never retires. And it\u2019s clear that Democrats learned very, very little as she is about to become speaker again. And I think we\u2019re all excited to have her be speaker again and remind the American people what that means. That means raising your taxes, weak on the border, San Francisco liberal values. And we\u2019ll see all these candidates who won\u2014saying they don\u2019t know who she is, or they\u2019ve never met her, would never take a picture with her, certainly not take any money from her\u2014we\u2019ll see who they vote for. I predict a lot of them will follow her every step of the way, and that\u2019ll be a big problem for them in two years. That\u2019ll be one of the reasons we take back the House in two years.\n\nTim Alberta is chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine.", "Now the House of Representative has flipped to the Democrats, conventional wisdom anticipates the new leadership will launch a wave of investigations into not only the president but also the proliferating scandals around figures such as Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Federal Emergency Management Agency chief Brock Long. The firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions only exacerbates that possibility.\n\nSome have even suggested that congressional investigations will suffice to address any legally questionable moves by the present administration. But such optimism should be tempered: The new House will have to proceed strategically in selecting both the topics and the tools of inquiry. Missteps will not only undermine proper oversight and generate partisan blowback. They might also sap the long-term prospects for maintaining an executive branch constrained by the rule of law\u2014something both liberals and conservatives should fear.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCongressional oversight is largely conducted by committees holding hearings and requesting information. House and Senate rules enable committees to issue subpoenas for information in the form of either live testimony or written documents. The current House rules vest this so-called powerful subpoena power exclusively with the committee majorities.\n\nThe power to issue a subpoena, however, is not the same as the power to extract information. Indeed, in very real terms, the House majorities\u2019 ability to ask for information doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get it, or that the ensuing fight won\u2019t inflict considerable collateral damage on the rule of law.\n\nMost important, an executive official can decline to produce information by citing the idea of an \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d against disclosure. This is the idea that presidents have a right to withhold information or documents because its release would, among other things, compromise the candor of their advisers or undermine national security.\n\nThe phrase \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d is both novel and ambiguous, and it is not mentioned in the Constitution. Although presidents had declined to make disclosures to Congress since the 1800s, the phrase was first used by President Dwight Eisenhower, who invoked it some 40 times during his tenure. It was later endorsed by the Supreme Court in the litigation over President Richard Nixon\u2019s White House tapes. That culminated in the well-known decision in United States v. Nixon, in which the court recognized the privilege, but refused to allow Nixon to invoke it against a subpoena issued by a prosecutor in a criminal investigation.\n\nMore than 40 years later, the court has not revisited the Nixon case, and only a smattering of lower courts have spoken to executive privilege\u2019s metes and bounds. This means that the precise scope of the privilege in terms of what materials can be withheld is highly uncertain. Given this presidency\u2019s record of pushing the constitutional envelope, we should expect ambitious, startling, and wholly novel claims of executive privilege to be proffered at every turn.\n\nHistorically, when the executive branch has refused to comply with an information request, Congress has had two means of enforcing subpoenas.\n\nFirst, a chamber has used its constitutional authority to enforce contempt orders by arresting an executive official. In February 1889, for example, the House\u2019s sergeant-at-arms forcibly brought former Minister to China George Seward to the House for impeachment proceedings after he appeared but failed to produce documents sought by the committee.\n\nToday, the idea of the House\u2019s sergeant-at-arms physically restraining an executive branch official seems jarringly inappropriate, to say the least. Such a move would likely stoke the violence that has been bubbling away, tragically, in U.S. political rhetoric and in the actions of some fringe groups. It is thus a tool that is no longer consistent with the (benign) norms of our present political culture\u2014to say nothing of its political cost. We see no merit to this path.\n\nCongress\u2019 second option is to go to the federal courts. For instance, when Bush II White House officials Harriet Miers and Josh Bolton declined to provide information about the allegedly improper firing of U.S. attorneys, the House Judiciary Committee sued\u2014and initially prevailed in federal District Court.\n\nBut the judicial safeguard against the excessive or abusive deployment of executive privilege is illusory for three reasons. First, the judiciary since the 1970s has been leery of ordering officials to produce information. In the Miers/Bolton matter, for example, the Court of Appeals stayed proceedings\u2014effectively extinguishing the possibility that either official would be forced to produce information. Even in the more liberal 1970s, in the immediate wake of the Nixon case, courts took pains to avoid confrontation with the executive.\n\nSecond, litigation takes months or years. It is always possible for the executive to run the clock on the House\u2014which has a two-year life by law\u2014by appealing, dickering and delaying, until an issue has lost its political legs.\n\nFinally, and most troubling, if the House ultimately presses its case beyond the District Courts and the Courts of Appeal it is likely to face a Supreme Court perhaps inclined to radically expand the executive\u2019s immunity from oversight. Recall that there is no textual basis in the Constitution for \u201cexecutive privilege.\u201d Moreover, the relevant history and judicial precedent are quite hazy. As a result, the John Roberts Supreme Court is unfettered by law when it comes to expanding executive privilege\u2014or even when it comes to creating new privileges from whole cloth. It is perhaps a bellwether that Justice Brett Kavanaugh has already intimated a sweeping view of the privilege\u2014a view that might shape the court\u2019s ultimate decisions.\n\nThe harm from such decisions would be long term and structural. The resulting legal rulings would impose permanent, potentially disabling, constraints on Congress\u2019 ability to ensure that this presidency\u2014or any future administration\u2014has acted under the rule of law. The immediate case for such constraints has only swelled with Matthew Whitaker\u2019s assumption of control over special counsel Robert Mueller\u2018s investigation. But those rulings would more permanently insulate bad actors in the executive from oversight\u2014a lasting prospect neither liberals nor conservatives should relish.\n\nAt the same time, the political costs of such a (likely) doomed confrontation for the House would be substantial. Just as the president has tarred the free press as \u201cenemies of the people,\u201d so he will claim the mantle of victimhood when confronted by a Congress that is anything other than a lapdog. The Sessions ouster makes such confrontation more likely, as perhaps the president anticipates (and relishes). The resulting politics of comparative victimhood is a game at which Trump excels\u2014and so is a contest that the House will likely lose. We see nothing salutary coming from such confrontations over basic tenets of the rule of law.\n\nThe congressional power of the subpoena, in short, is far less powerful than many (including, it seems the president) presently believe it to be. But if the standard tools to press the executive for disclosure and oversight are handicapped, is there any path that the House could take?\n\nIn short, yes. A successful strategy of oversight can still have teeth while avoiding legalistic confrontations over executive privilege. Here\u2019s what the House needs to do:\n\nFirst, it should recognize that it has the power to investigate without using subpoenas. historical evidence suggests that hearings and investigations, even in the absence of judicially forced disclosure, materially influence the president\u2019s public standing. As the political scientists Douglas Kriner and Eric Schickler have demonstrated through a meticulous review of past investigations into the conduct and policies of a president and his administration, the public record created by these investigations significantly dents presidential standing and can inflect policy outcomes. Imagine such an investigation into the Trump International Hotel\u2019s dealings with foreign dignitaries, and the potential impact of revelations about financial improprieties.\n\nSecond, the House should be strategic about who it subpoenas. The force of executive privilege claims weakens considerably when the person asserting it is not an official or a former official. For many of the scandals surrounding the president and his Cabinet, there are an array of private actors, including former campaign staff and the financial intermediaries to the Trump family, who could provide important information about the underlying scandals. Such people can be compelled to testify and provide documents within quite wide bounds.\n\nThe outgoing House and the Senate have employed this strategy tenaciously\u2014and perhaps tendentiously\u2014and there is no reason why the House now cannot make real progress following the same path.\n\nThird, the House should think big and focus not just on nailing down specific facts, but on creating a common basis for public debate. Investigations aren\u2019t only useful for uncovering criminal wrongdoing or other administration scandals. They can establish facts. In an era when Americans increasingly do not share common perceptions of reality, Congress can play an important role in making persuasively and comprehensively sourced findings. These in turn can influence public discourse at a time when the press is, quite literally, under attack.\n\nThere are no end of such investigations to be pursued. Our favorite would focus on debunking misleading claims about the correlations between immigration and crime, and on casting a light on the tremendous human cost of family separation at the border. But the key point is that there are an embarrassment of such platforms that need not create perilous confrontations over executive privilege.\n\nMuch about the next two years is uncertain. One thing, though, we think is already clear given the cavalcade of events after the midterm: The legal powers that the new House majority possesses are more fragile, and more vulnerable to backlash, than many believe. If those powers are to be exercised in ways that benefit our democracy and the rule of law\u2014and not just narrow partisan ends\u2014wisdom and caution will have to be the watchwords of the day.\n\nAziz Huq teaches law at the University of Chicago Law School and is co-author of How to Save a Constitutional Democracy.\n\nTom Ginsburg teaches law at the University of Chicago Law School and is co-author of How to Save a Constitutional Democracy.\n\nThis article tagged under: House Democrats\n\nDonald Trump", "poster=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/963/1155968404_5966537081001_5859541018001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true Elections How an all-woman, pro-gun control ad crew is flipping Republican seats Moving from state to state, Sarah Ullman\u2019s crew has attempted a small-scale revolution in the political admaking process\n\nWhen Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut gave his now-famous filibuster in the aftermath of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting, his impassioned plea for increased gun control galvanized liberals across the country. One of them, all the way on the other coast in Los Angeles, was Sarah Ullman. The 30-year-old had once interned for Murphy and relocated to pursue a career as a filmmaker, but she was moved deeply enough that she launched a special undertaking, separate from but related to her primary career. She began to make political ads for progressive, pro-gun control candidates across the country with her super PAC, One Vote at a Time.\n\nBut Ullman wasn\u2019t satisfied with the traditional admaking process. Where other admakers would see an opportunity to spend big-time campaign dollars on glitzy feathers in their cap, Ullman saw a market inefficiency. Employing a crew of all women, Ullman decided to make her ads fast, cheap and straight to the point, allowing her to provide them pro bono to progressive candidates in crucial state-level races. Moving from state to state, Ullman\u2019s crew has attempted a small-scale revolution in the political admaking process, providing professional-quality spots for candidates who might otherwise have had to cough up crucial campaign dollars for them. Of the 190 candidates for whom Ullman\u2019s group cut ads, 76 won their races this week, all except one of those offices flipping from red to blue \u2014 a result that Ullman hopes to continue to improve upon in 2020.", "POLITICO Illustration/Getty Images Nerdcast Trump comes to grips with divided government\n\nIt\u2019s time for a new episode of Nerdcast, POLITICO\u2019s podcast on the White House and politics.

However, the allegations against Sullivan directly involve Sanchez, a former ranking member of the House Ethics Committee.\n\nSullivan is alleged to have improperly charged personal expenses to the Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, a consortium of six municipal electric utilities. These alleged improper expenses included taking Sanchez to the Kentucky Derby in 2013 and 2014. Those trips were first reported by the Norwich Bulletin in early 2017.\n\nIn addition, Sullivan expensed a trip for Sanchez to Key West in December 2014, according to the Justice Department, as well as paid for trips back and forth to Washington.\n\nAt the time of those trips, Sullivan was serving as chairman of the Norwich Board of Public Utilities Commission, which oversees Norwich Public Utilities and is part of the CMEEC, the Bulletin reported.\n\nThe CMEEC was the recipient of $9 million in federal funds between 2010 and 2015, according to Thursday\u2019s indictment, which brought the FBI into the case.\n\nSanchez\u2019s office said the California Democrat received approval for the Kentucky Derby and Key West trips from the Ethics Committee. The trips were not disclosed on Sanchez\u2019s annual financial disclosure forms.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Sanchez attended the event in her personal capacity as the spouse of a board member, which is expressly allowed under House rules,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAlthough she was not required to do so, out of an abundance of caution she did seek the advice of the House Ethics Committee prior to attending, and the committee confirmed that she could attend.\u201d\n\nHouse ethics rules allow a spouse\u2019s employer to cover the cost of trips that aren\u2019t related to official duties.\n\nSanchez was first elected to Congress in 2002 after a stint working for labor unions in California. Linda and Loretta Sanchez made history by being the first sisters to serve in Congress together.\n\nSanchez, who was vice chairwoman of the Democratic Caucus, has been involved in a number of difficult jobs as a lawmaker. Her stint on the Judiciary Committee included the U.S attorney firing scandal during the George W. Bush administration. She also was a member of the Select Committee on Benghazi, investigating the 2012 fatal attack on U.S. government facilities in Libya.

Rick Scott took the unprecedented step Thursday of asking state law enforcement to investigate election officials playing a key role in a recount involving his U.S. Senate campaign. The impromptu announcement was organized by his campaign and held at the Florida Governor's Mansion, the governor's taxpayer-funded home.\n\nScott\u2019s request to have the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigate embattled Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes came moments after his Senate campaign joined the National Republican Senatorial Committee in filing two emergency lawsuits against Snipes and Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher, saying their offices are not complying with state public records laws.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe announcement, blurring Scott\u2019s official roles as governor and U.S. Senate candidate, is the latest twist in a midterm election cycle that has once again put Florida in the national spotlight for election gaffes. In simple terms, Scott is asking state law enforcement to investigate two local election officials playing a pivotal role in a recount that involves his run against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement is overseen by the Florida Cabinet, not Scott directly, but in 2015 he had a big role in ousting the department\u2019s commissioner and installing current Commissioner Rick Swearingen. Gretl Plessinger, spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said the agency will open an investigation at Scott\u2019s request.\n\nScott had a narrow lead over Nelson after election night, but that has continued to narrow. A recount had already been set for Nov. 10, but on Thursday night the margin narrowed to .18 percent, which is in the range to trigger a manual recount under Florida law. That has not yet been called.\n\nThe fact that votes continue to come out of Broward, a Democrat stronghold, has been a point of contention for Democrats since election night. Snipes, a Democrat appointed to her post by Republican former Gov. Jeb Bush, has taken much of the heat not only for her performance this year, but for a resume littered with high-profile election gaffes.\n\nIn 48 the hours since the polls closed, \u201cBroward and Palm Beach counties are still finding and counting ballots,\u201d Scott told reporters Thursday evening, declining to take questions. \u201cThe people of Florida deserve fairness and transparency, and the supervisors are failing to give it to them.\u201d\n\nWithout providing evidence of fraud, Scott said he was concerned about \u201crampant fraud,\u201d noting that Palm Beach has added 15,000 votes since election night and Broward County\u2019s vote count went from 634,000 to more than 695,000.\n\nThe event was hastily organized by Scott\u2019s Senate campaign, whose staff was advancing the event in jeans and t-shirts. Those in Scott\u2019s formal office said they were not aware of what was happening beforehand.\n\nThe lawsuits filed with the NRSC, which was involved with his campaign, said that both Palm Beach and Broward county election officials are not complying with state public record laws.\n\n\u201cTwo days after voting has concluded, the Supervisor Of Elections is unwilling to disclose records revealing how many electors voted, how many ballots have been canvassed, and how many ballots remain to be canvassed,\u201d Scott\u2019s lawsuit, filed with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said.\n\n\u201cThe lack of transparency raises substantial concerns about the validity of the election process,\u201d the suit said. \u201cAn emergency hearing is necessary as the Canvassing Board is obligated to submit the unofficial elections results to the Division of Elections by noon November 10, 2018.\u201d\n\nThe suit was filed by attorney Aliette Rodz with the firm Shutts & Bowen LLP and George Levesque, an attorney with GrayRobinson.\n\nCritics of the governor quickly took to social media to note the irony of a public-records lawsuit being filed by Scott, who has been sued multiple times for refusing to disclose public records and was even caught using a private email account to conduct state business. Scott had lied about the private email account in claiming he only used it to talk to family members.\n\nScott\u2019s announcement was criticized by Democrats who say he just wants to stop all the votes from being counted so he can be declared the winner against Nelson. Nelson\u2019s campaign questioned the legality of the governor making a campaign-related announcement from the Governor\u2019s Mansion, a state building.\n\n\u201cThe goal here is to see that all the votes in Florida are counted and counted accurately,\u201d Nelson spokesperson Dan McLaughlin said of the pending recount. \u201cRick Scott\u2019s action appears to be politically motivated and borne out of desperation.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s lawsuit comes as a rising bipartisan chorus of voices has begun to call for the removal of Snipes, whose office has been the subject of a string of controversies over the years. Democrats fault her office for a poor ballot design that may have cost Nelson votes because thousands of voters may not have seen the race tucked into the lower right hand corner of the ballot.\n\nThe election controversy, right down to Democrats\u2019 call to count every vote, echoes the state\u2019s most-infamous election meltdown, the 2000 presidential race, in which Broward County played a central role during a recount of tens of thousands of undervotes and overvotes that was ultimately stopped by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFor the past two days, Snipes could not or would not provide campaigns, the press or the public with a tally of how many votes were left to be counted while tens of thousands of new votes \u2014 many of them vote-by-mail absentee ballots received on Election Day, in the Democrat-heavy county poured in.\n\nThe changing vote counts led to recounts in the U.S. Senate race that pits Scott against Nelson. On Thursday afternoon, the margins in the governor\u2019s race between Republican Ron DeSantis and Democrat Andrew Gillum fell below the 0.5 percentage point state threshold for triggering a recount, thanks in large part to Broward\u2019s ever-changing vote totals. In both of those cases, the Republicans continue to hold leads, even thought those have gotten smaller since election night.\n\nThe Florida agriculture commissioner race, a statewide elected post, is headed to a recount to be conducted by hand. It features Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell against Democrat Nikki Fried. Fried was trailing after election night, but has since taken a small lead.\n\nAs the margins became smaller, Republicans became angrier and, in the case of Sen. Marco Rubio, more conspiratorial. Rubio on Twitter accused Snipes of breaking the law concerning the timely counting of ballots, but didn\u2019t specify what law that was. He also noted that Snipes had lost court battles concerning her office\u2019s policy of handling absentee ballots and its destruction of ballots that a 2016 congressional candidate wanted to review.\n\n\u201c#Broward election supervisors ongoing violation of #Florida law requiring timely reporting isn\u2019t just annoying incompetence,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIt has opened the door for lawyers to come here & try to steal a seat in the U.S. Senate & Florida Cabinet.\u201d\n\nRubio also referenced the Aug. 28 school board race involving the father of a slain Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student, Ryan Petty, who thought he was going to force a runoff against an incumbent but learned the next day that a crush of newly \u201cfound\u201d ballots gave his opponent just enough of an edge to win the race.\n\nAs the nation\u2019s eyes \u2014 and state election law lawyers \u2014 began focusing on Broward, Petty said Snipes should leave office or be removed by the governor.", "A cabinet post for former New Jersey governor Chirs Christie would be a dramatic plot twist in his complicated, years-long relationship with the Trump family. | Willy Sanjuan/Invision/AP White House Sessions\u2019 job is hard to fill. Enter Chris Christie.

(After this story was published, a source familiar with Acosta's thinking insisted that he would accept an offer with no conditions.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs a result, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie has emerged as a strong contender, according to two former White House officials briefed on the ongoing discussions, one of whom predicted that \u201cthis is going to end up with Christie.\u201d The president has said in recent days that he believes Christie, the first prominent Republican to back his presidential bid, has patiently waited his turn after being passed over for the job during the post-2016 election transition.\n\nThat said, candidates for top Trump administration jobs have learned that Trump\u2019s whims are subject to sudden changes, thanks to anything from a bad-chemistry meeting to a snippet of critical cable TV commentary the president happens to catch. Other candidates are in the mix, including Solicitor General Noel Francisco. And several sources said that Trump is in no particular hurry to fill his top law enforcement position.\n\nThe post opened on Wednesday when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions submitted his resignation at the president\u2019s request. Trump has appointed Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Matt Whitaker, to take the job on an acting basis. Whoever replaces Sessions permanently will inherit oversight of Mueller\u2019s probe into 2016 Russian election interference, if it is still ongoing. Trump has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and indicated he wants an attorney general who will carry out his wishes as it relates to the investigation, while Democrats say he has sought to obstruct by pressuring senior Justice Department officials.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

Christie ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican primaries before advising and representing his campaign. As a U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Christie led a 2004 criminal prosecution that landed Jared Kushner\u2019s father, Charles Kushner, behind bars for tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions \u2014 and earned him the enmity of Trump\u2019s son-in-law.\n\nBut Christie was at the White House on Thursday for a long-scheduled meeting on criminal justice reform, an issue both he and Kushner support. White House officials said Thursday that Kushner\u2019s ambition to make progress on the cause could incentivize him to set aside his anger. Christie, for his part, has been \u201ctrying to mend some fences\u201d with Kushner and first daughter Ivanka Trump, according to a former White House official.\n\n\u201cThat stuff is ancient history,\u201d Christie said in a March 2017 interview, insisting that he and Kushner \u201cget along just great.\u201d One person who attended a White House holiday party last year recalled seeing Christie and his wife, Mary Pat, chatting amiably with Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\n\nWhatever bitterness remains between the two, it\u2019s unlikely Kushner has the power to kneecap Christie\u2019s candidacy if he wanted to do so. Trump associates predict the president will do as he likes, and doubt that Kushner wants to get deeply involved in a job appointment that Mueller, who is said to be considering whether Trump has sought to obstruct his probe, may scrutinize.\n\nChristie arrived in Washington Thursday morning after boarding a 6:15 am Amtrak Acela train from Newark, N.J. He disembarked in conversation with the former NBA star Dikembe Mutombo.\n\nChristie\u2019s prospects of becoming the next attorney general have brightened as less controversial candidates have begged off, in part due to Trump\u2019s handling of the Mueller probe.\n\nAt one time, a possible successor to Sessions was the Justice Department\u2019s third-ranking official, Rachel Brand. But she left her post for the private sector in February \u2014 reportedly in part to avoid the prospect of overseeing the politically explosive Mueller investigation. Brand would have been put in charge of the probe if the president had fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who became Mueller\u2019s supervisor after Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe early last year.\n\nAs Attorney General, Christie himself could face calls to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, given his prominent role in Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. At a March 2017 press conference explaining his recusal, Sessions said that Justice Department lawyers \u201csaid that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation.\u201d (Sessions had also come under fire for not fully disclosing 2016 contacts with Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington.)\n\nDuring Sessions\u2019 tenure, which came to an abrupt end on Wednesday, Trump fumed at him both in public and in private for his recusal, and told advisers on countless occasions that he believed he deserved a loyal attorney general who served him the way Eric Holder served Barack Obama.\n\nWhitaker is considered a loyalist, and he has repeatedly criticized Mueller and his probe \u2014 raising alarms among Democrats who fear he might try to limit or even end the Russia investigation. But Trump officials are looking for someone with stronger credentials more likely to survive what could be a contentious Senate confirmation process.\n\nAttorney General may be just one of several cabinet vacancies Trump will need to fill in the coming months, amid widespread talk that several top officials could leave or be pushed out.\n\nSpeculation is growing about the fate of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, about whom Trump has expressed private frustration. The 80-year-old billionaire has supported Trump\u2019s controversial tariffs on trade partners, but may be asked to resign as Trump weighs post-midterm personnel changes.\n\nThe leading candidate to replace Ross if that happens is now Small Business Administration chief Linda McMahon, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. McMahon has made clear she is interested in the position and would accept it if it is offered, according to a source familiar with the conversations.\n\nWhether Ross stays or goes will depend on the extent to which newly empowered Democrats in the House decide to probe the Commerce secretary\u2019s finances and questions about his divestment of assets, a White House official said. If Democrats decide to press those issues, Ross could have a harder time staying.\n\nMcMahon and her husband, Vince \u2014 the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment \u2014 have known the Trumps for years and were early and active supporters of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. McMahon, who initially backed Christie\u2019s 2016 White House bid, is credited in part with helping secure his support for Trump during the campaign.\n\nInside the White House, McMahon is viewed as largely pro-free trade and less friendly to tariffs than Ross. So her takeover at Commerce, if it happens, might be seen as a shift away from economic policies that critics call protectionist. In an administration filled with big personalities and which has struggled to attract talent, she is appreciated for being low-key, competent, loyal \u2014 and easily confirmable by the Senate.", "Tens of thousands of activist-organized protesters gathered at 900 events across the country on Thursday night calling on Matthew Whitaker, the new head of the Justice Department, to recuse himself from the Russia inquiry because of conflicts of interest. | Charlie Neibergall, File/AP Photo Legal Mueller's new boss immediately draws enemies Critics say Matthew Whitaker might intervene to protect the president, while newly emboldened Democrats pledge vigilance.\n\nActing Attorney General Matt Whitaker is only one day into the job and already he looms large over special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nTens of thousands of activist-organized protesters gathered at 900 events across the country on Thursday night \u2014 including in Times Square and in front of the White House \u2014 calling on the new interim head of the Justice Department to recuse himself from the Russia inquiry because of conflicts of interest.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe outspoken husband of White House senior counsel Kellyanne Conway co-authored a New York Times op-ed deeming President Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Whitaker \u2014 to replace the fired Jeff Sessions, for whom Whitaker served as chief of staff \u2014 as unconstitutional.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, House Democrats still in celebratory mode after winning back majority status in Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections convened an emergency conference call to discuss plans to investigate Sessions\u2019 ouster when they have gavels and subpoena power in January.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s promotion even surfaced at the start of a federal court hearing in Washington, where an appellate judge presiding in a case that centers on the legality of Mueller\u2019s appointment told lawyers representing the special counsel and a former aide to longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone that they should plan to file supplemental briefs that address the change in command atop the Justice Department.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

They vowed to be vigilant in watchdogging him.\n\n\u201cThere are no secrets,\u201d said Norm Eisen, the former top ethics official in the Obama White House. \u201cIf he steps out of line, it\u2019s going to become known.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s allies countered that Whitaker is a welcome new face replacing Sessions, whose own recusal from overseeing the Mueller investigation and all other matters tied to the controversial 2016 election has long frustrated the president.\n\n\u201cTerrific!\u201d John Dowd, the president\u2019s former personal attorney, said in an email to POLITICO when asked for comment about Whitaker\u2019s appointment.\n\nTrump\u2019s current team of lawyers insisted on Thursday that the appointment of a new attorney general would not affect the way they interact with the special counsel.\n\n\u201cI think that any rational decision maker would come out the same way on this as a lawyer, so I don\u2019t know how much difference it makes,\u201d Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said in an interview.\n\nUnder DOJ regulations governing his position, Mueller is actually not subject to daily supervision from anyone in the department.\n\nBut Whitaker, who before joining Justice made dozens of public comments critical of the special counsel appointment, has now picked up veto power for some of Mueller\u2019s most important moves.\n\nFor starters, Whitaker can ask the special counsel for explanations on any investigative or prosecutorial steps, and he has the authority to overturn anything Mueller does if he deems it \u201cso inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.\u201d\n\nWhitaker\u2019s new role means he is primed to have immediate influence over Mueller ahead of key court dates involving cooperating government witnesses, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort (a pre-sentencing status report is due Nov. 16); former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen (a sentencing date is set for Dec. 12 in a case in federal court in New York referred by Mueller\u2019s office); and former national security adviser Michael Flynn (a sentencing date is set for Dec. 18.).\n\nThe new acting attorney general is also positioned to weigh in on a topic central to the president who just appointed him: whether Mueller can subpoena Trump and force his testimony.\n\nGiuliani on Thursday said the president and his lawyers were scheduled to have a critical meeting next week to discuss whether to respond in writing to a first round of written questions. Once that decision is made, Trump\u2019s attorneys and the special counsel can re-engage in negotiations over a sit-down interview that would cover topics related to Trump\u2019s time in the White House \u2014 including the May 2017 firing of FBI Director James Comey that spawned a probe into whether the president committed obstruction of justice.\n\nNo subpoena has been issued for Trump\u2019s testimony yet, but Giuliani said that talks with Mueller on the topic could still break down and result in a high-profile legal fight. \u201cWe both agreed to leave it open to discussion,\u201d the president\u2019s lawyer said.\n\nWhitaker has final say over major Mueller moves involving indictments. And while those kinds of actions have largely remained under wraps until they are unsealed in court, several members of the president\u2019s inner circle of longtime aides, associates and family members, including Stone and Donald Trump Jr., remain in the crosshairs.\n\nThe acting attorney general will also have an important role in Mueller\u2019s end game . The special counsel at the end of his work must submit to Whitaker a confidential final report explaining why he chose to bring charges against some people but not others.\n\nA decision on whether to make that report public will rest with Whitaker.\n\n\u201cI can see a scenario where somebody who may perceive his loyalty more to Trump than to the department and the public deciding the report is in and it\u2019s sealed,\u201d said one former top Justice official in the Obama administration. \u201cJust like the Watergate report. It\u2019d be available in 40 or 50 years.\u201d\n\nWhitaker can\u2019t totally stifle Mueller.\n\nThe DOJ regulations also require the acting attorney general at the end of the Mueller investigation to issue a report to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees spelling out any major moves the special counsel wanted to make but that got vetoed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll have to take the heat for those if it looks like those were politically motivated,\u201d said Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor and former DOJ official who helped oversee the FBI\u2019s Russian-meddling investigation before Mueller\u2019s appointment in May 2017.\n\nTrump, of course, has been no fan of the Mueller inquiry since its start. During his post-election news conference on Wednesday, the president mused about his power to end the investigation if he wanted to. \u201cI could fire everybody right now, but I don\u2019t want to stop it because, politically, I don\u2019t like stopping it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nBut with Whitaker now atop the Justice Department, one less-noticeable way to meddle with Mueller would entail repealing or rewriting the underlying DOJ regulations in a bid to shutter the special counsel\u2019s work or to eliminate the requirement for congressional notice whenever he\u2019s overruled.\n\n\u201cIn this administration, nothing would surprise me,\u201d the former senior Justice official in the Obama administration said. \u201cThey\u2019ve already proven themselves to use tactics that you don\u2019t see in the United States.\u201d\n\nA DOJ spokeswoman declined comment on Thursday when asked whether Whitaker had any plans to rewrite the underlying special counsel regulations.\n\nBefore joining the department, Whitaker suggested during a CNN interview that one way to stymie Mueller was for a new attorney general who replaces Sessions to reduce his budget \u201cso low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\u201d But that train may have already left the station \u2014 at least for the next 10-plus months, because Mueller got approval in July from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for his spending through the end of the current fiscal year.\n\nFor now, Mueller appears to be full steam ahead \u2014 no matter who\u2019s atop DOJ.\n\nOn Thursday, Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, who represents Mueller\u2019s office, argued in federal appeals court that Mueller\u2019s supervision was one of the critical elements backing up why his appointment is constitutionally sound.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the case that the special counsel is off wandering in a free-floating environment and can decide when to report,\u201d Dreeben said during oral arguments in the case, which centers on a Mueller subpoena to compel testimony from Andrew Miller, Stone\u2019s former aide.\n\nAlso Thursday, the special counsel\u2019s office appeared to file a 12,970-word sealed brief, a sealed motion and a sealed supplemental appendix in federal appeals court in a mystery case involving a different fight over one of his grand jury subpoenas.\n\nSessions\u2019 status atop the Justice Department had long been tenuous. And some observers say Mueller appears to have been operating with that in mind, noting his moves to hand off some of his work to other U.S. attorneys around the country.\n\nJon Sale, an assistant special prosecutor during Watergate and a close friend of Giuliani\u2019s, said he expected that Mueller had prepared for possible meddling from above by interviewing witnesses with FBI agents in the room, rather than bringing them before a grand jury where the testimony is more difficult to share. He also said the special counsel could have filed both sealed indictments and grand jury reports in federal court, where a judge would have the final say on their release.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt the people in Mueller\u2019s office have a contingency plan,\u201d Sale said.\n\nPolitically, Whitaker has become a launching pad for Trump critics, who on Thursday used his appointment as the rallying cry for a mass protest organized to support the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always conceived of this as a show of opposition and a deterrent force to make noise if something like this did happen,\u201d Leah Greenberg, one of the former House Democratic aides who co-founded the liberal anti-Trump network Indivisible, said in an interview about the protests.\n\nIndeed, the Sessions-Whitaker shakeup was front and center as protesters gathered from Dayton, Ohio, to the Boston Commons. Two of their hashtags \u2014 #NoOneIsAboveTheLaw and #ProtectMueller \u2014 were trending on Twitter.\n\nElana Schor contributed to this report.", "poster=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201811/795/1155968404_5859496769001_5859491003001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true Congress Opposition to Pelosi hardens The California Democrat can\u2019t afford to lose much more support if she\u2019s going to win back the speakership.\n\nTen Democratic incumbents or members-elect told POLITICO that they will vote against Nancy Pelosi for speaker on the House floor, exposing a serious problem for the California Democrat in her bid to reclaim the gavel.\n\nEight sitting lawmakers or their offices said on Thursday that they will oppose Pelosi on the floor.

However, Democratic leaders believe they\u2019ll net another half-dozen seats that have yet to be formally called, meaning Pelosi could lose up to 14 members.\n\nMeanwhile, the anti-Pelosi faction \u2014 whom some have dubbed the \u201crevolutionaries\u201d or the \u201crebels\u201d \u2014 are working to grow their numbers. Eight of them joined an hour-long conference call Wednesday night to discuss strategy and messaging. They\u2019ve divvied up the names of just-elected candidates who have called for \u201cnew leadership\u201d and are reaching out to encourage them to vote against Pelosi on the floor.\n\nThese members\u2019 pitch to incoming lawmakers is this: You\u2019re not alone.\n\nThe Pelosi critics are arguing that they may be able to deliver as many as a dozen incumbents to vote against Pelosi on the floor, and that they could be successful in ousting her should these incoming freshmen join forces.\n\nThe eight lawmakers or offices who have confirmed to POLITICO that they intend to vote against Pelosi on the floor are Democratic Reps. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, who organized the Wednesday night call, Kathleen Rice of New York, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Bill Foster of Illinois, Tim Ryan of Ohio, Filemon Vela of Texas, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Rep. Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe campaigns of Reps.-Elect Abigail Spanberger and Jason Crow have told POLITICO their bosses won\u2019t vote for her on the floor. Pelosi critics say there are more to come, but until these members publicly say so, it is unclear if they will follow through.\n\nThis list does not include two Democrats who voted against Pelosi in 2016: Reps. Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Ron Kind of Wisconsin. Neither office has returned request for comment about whether they intend to do the same again.\n\nPelosi has been working behind the scenes to lock down support and is already making some headway. Two lawmakers have removed their names from a letter calling for rules changes that would make it more difficult for her to become speaker. One of those, Rep. Robin Kelly, told POLITICO that she will support Pelosi on the floor.\n\n\"I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together, get us organized and start off on the right foot as we get back to work for the American people,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe other lawmaker who removed his name, Rep. Albio Sires of New Jersey, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut Pelosi has also won over another former critic, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who released a statement Thursday night saying he backs her: \u201cThe new Democratic majority must deliver results for the American people. I am convinced that at this critical moment, Nancy Pelosi remains the right person for the job.\u201d\n\nPelosi allies are hoping to convince some of the incoming lawmakers to oppose her in a secret ballot caucus vote, where she only needs half the Democrats to win the nomination, and then vote for her on the floor. There\u2019s also been talk of having some vote \u201cpresent\u201d or skip the vote to pad her margin.\n\nSchrader, who was working Thursday afternoon to organize a call with the new freshman class, said these candidates would be foolish to do so and that it would open them up to political attack ads in 2020.\n\n\u201cIf they say they\u2019re not going to vote for Pelosi on their campaign, then they turn around and do that\u2026 I think that\u2019d be a foolish exercise for them, and I\u2019m just trying to advise them on the smart thing to do,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, Ryan has also been encouraging the group of rebels to frame the issue as a matter of protecting the majority: these members said on the trail that they would back new leadership or won\u2019t back Pelosi. They\u2019re likely to be attacked by Republicans in the future if they flip-flop.\n\nAs if on cue, the Republican National Committee on Thursday taunted Democratic winners about whether they would keep their word.\n\n\u201cWhich House Democrats will break this critical promise to their constituents as their first official act?\u201d read an email that listed all the Democratic candidates who called for \u201cnew leadership\u201d or said they would not back Pelosi.\n\nAccording to anti-Pelosi organizers, the lawmakers willing to vote against her have discussed putting their names on a letter saying that they will be a no on the House floor. They ultimately decided to postpone that plan and instead work to grow their numbers first.\n\nHowever, the group agreed on the call Wednesday night that they would propose the rule \u2014 a requirement that the speaker nominee receive 218 votes in caucus as well as on the House floor \u2014 as early as next week: first, in a caucus meeting with current members, and then again in a separate caucus meeting with new members-elect. Currently, Pelosi only needs support from half the caucus to get the nomination.\n\nThe rebels' biggest problem is this: They don\u2019t have someone to challenge her, and as Pelosi allies like to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t replace someone with no one.\u201d\n\nSome Pelosi critics had encouraged Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York to run for speaker, but Jeffries declared Thursday for the No. 4 House post, caucus chair. Ryan, who unsuccessfully challenged Pelosi in 2016, has said he\u2019s not currently looking to run, though he didn\u2019t rule out doing so.\n\nSchrader acknowledged having a challenger would help their cause since some members feel more comfortable voting for someone rather than simply voting against Pelosi. But Schrader said he understands why no one has jumped in due to the intense backlash the person may face for going up against the most powerful lawmaker in the caucus.\n\n\u201cThat person becomes the focus of the discussion\u2026 gets beat up badly \u2026 and it gets to be pretty ugly pretty quick,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main message is: \u2018Anybody but her.\u2019 Then, it opens up a much friendlier, better discussion about the talent we have in our caucus.\u201d", "Most of the outstanding ballots are coming from Arizona's largest county, Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix and includes Kyrsten Sinema's congressional district. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images Elections Sinema takes slim lead in too-close-to-call Arizona Senate race\n\nDemocratic Rep.
