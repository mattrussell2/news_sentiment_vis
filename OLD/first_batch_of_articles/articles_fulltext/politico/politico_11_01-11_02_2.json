Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) remain well known to the electorate from prior campaigns, and they both traveled to the state in October. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) has lent aid to Nevada Democrats, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), drew raucous applause when she addressed the state Democratic Party at its convention in Reno in June.\n\nIn a nod to their common ground, two Californians nursing presidential ambitions \u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris and billionaire Tom Steyer \u2014 rallied Democrats in separate appearances in Las Vegas on the state\u2019s final day of early voting. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has visited Las Vegas repeatedly this year and raised money for Nevada Democrats in Los Angeles, including $100,000 for the state party.\n\nSteyer, appearing at a rally in a sun-drenched parking lot in Las Vegas, said \u201cevery state, honest to goodness, is separate, and I think it\u2019s unfair to lump them together.\u201d And Harris, campaigning alongside Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen in her Senate bid, said she views each state as \u201cvery distinct \u2014 interconnected, but very distinct.\u201d\n\nStill, Harris told POLITICO there is \u201cno question there\u2019s some truth to the fact that geographic accessibility makes it easier for people to just go back and forth, obviously.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Harris\u2019 2020 campaign will likely rely on busloads of activists and labor union volunteers crossing the border from Northern California to the Reno area, and from Southern California into Las Vegas and its suburbs. Laying groundwork for that effort, Harris, who is close with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nevada), has sent $25,000 to the state Democratic Party here, cut get-out-the-vote advertisements and raised thousands of dollars for statewide candidates.\n\nThe newest of the four early primary states, Nevada has held its early caucuses only since 2008. But Andres Ramirez, a Nevada-based Democratic strategist, described its status as \u201csomewhat nebulous\u201d in the primary calendar, often overshadowed by Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nBut with Nevada\u2019s cultural and geographic ties to California, said Ramirez, a former vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Hispanic Caucus, Nevada in 2020 could position itself as a significant \u201ctest run\u201d for Democratic candidates and operatives \u201cto test messages \u2026 gain some experience\u201d before returning to California and its delegate-rich primary.\n\nThe Democratic electorates in both states are diverse, with significant Hispanic communities, and Nevada draws more in-migration from California than any other state. In 2008, when California last held an early primary, Clinton carried the state against then-Sen. Barack Obama and also won the vote in the Nevada caucuses, though Obama won more delegates to the national convention from Nevada.\n\n\u201cThe mayor of L.A. is a big deal to Las Vegas and Southern Nevada,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cBy the time the next election comes around, you\u2019ll have tens of thousands, if not 100,000, Californians from Southern California who have become residents of Nevada during Mayor Garcetti\u2019s tenure as mayor \u2026 If you\u2019re a Western candidate and you\u2019ve performed well and you win Nevada, and the next major prize is in California, that\u2019s going to give you a lot of momentum.\u201d\n\nThe pairing of Nevada and California does not come without risk for a Democrat attempting to appeal to both. Republicans in Nevada have long warned of California-style policies crossing the border, a central campaign theme of Adam Laxalt, the Republican candidate for governor this year.\n\nEven many Democrats are \u201cxenophobic when it comes to California,\u201d said Bob Fulkerson, state director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada Action Fund, a group that runs registration and turnout operations in the state. \u201cAny candidates that talk about \u2018We\u2019re going to make this a California-Nevada thing, it would rally be a turn-off for a lot of Nevadans.\u201d\n\nStill, Fulkerson said that if candidates could use the primary calendar to campaign in both states, \u201cyou would get a two-for-one deal \u2026 I think it would really work in a primary, because the voters are going to be similar.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have invested millions of dollars in Nevada this year attempting to increase turnout among Latinos and low propensity voters, not only with an eye to the state\u2019s competitive midterm elections, but in an attempt to put Nevada out of reach for Republicans in 2020. President Donald Trump lost Nevada by just more than 2 percentage points in 2016, and he is expected to compete again in the state in 2020.\n\nWilliam McCurdy, chairman of the Nevada Democratic Party, said that \u201cin Nevada, as a whole, we\u2019re becoming more and more blue.\u201d In regards to its relationship with California, a bastion of progressivism, he said, \u201cI guess you could say that we have a lot of shared values.\u201d", "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is seen reflected off a window of a security booth after speaking to members of the media outside the White House on Aug. 16. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo Energy & Environment Vise tightens around Zinke 'People are assuming that there is something there,' one former administration official says, as some one-time allies distance themselves.\n\nEmbattled Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is finding himself with fewer defenders inside or outside the Trump administration, as one-time supporters in industry drift away and his sagging popularity in his native Montana appears to be keeping him off the campaign trail.\n\nThe pileup of ethics investigations into the former Navy SEAL and congressman is not only placing Zinke in potential legal jeopardy. It\u2019s also alienating many of the same industry groups and Trump allies who welcomed his arrival at the Interior Department just 19 months ago, according to people who requested anonymity to protect their relationships with the administration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMany of those same people are predicting that Zinke will step aside and let Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist and experienced bureaucratic infighter, fill the agency\u2019s top slot.\n\nThat would almost certainly bring no change in the Interior Department\u2019s support for President Donald Trump's policies of loosening restrictions on drilling, fracking and mining on federal lands and waters. But it could mean fewer embarrassing headlines about lavish travel expenses, taxpayer-funded helicopter trips and personal development deals involving the chairman of Halliburton.\n\n\u201cPeople are assuming that there is something there and that Bernhardt is going to step into the role,\u201d one former administration official said.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Earlier this week, news reports said the Interior Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General had referred one of its Zinke investigations to the Justice Department.\n\nEven before those developments, a June poll funded by the conservation group Center for Western Priorities showed that Zinke\u2019s approval rating in Montana \u2014 which he once represented as its sole House member \u2014 was 36 percent, with 49 percent disapproving. Focus groups found that Montana residents did not disagree with all of Trump\u2019s public lands policies but vehemently disliked the Interior Department\u2019s shrinking of protected acreage at several national monuments, including the Bear\u2019s Ears monument in Utah.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like everything was unpopular,\u201d said Brian Gottlieb, a Republican pollster who conducted the survey on behalf of the nonprofit. \u201cBut the public land thing was extreme. When his name came up, they would say, \u2018Was he the guy who did that Utah thing?\u2019\u201d\n\nZinke has been notably absent from campaigning in his home state in recent months, even though the race between Montana Republican challenger Matt Rosendale and Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is one of the key races that will decide the balance of power in Washington. Zinke has not joined Trump at any of the president\u2019s three rallies in Montana since the summer, and he does not appear on the schedule for the president\u2019s rally Saturday in Bozeman, Mont.\n\nZinke also did not join last week\u2019s Montana campaign swing by Donald Trump Jr., who just two years ago had supported his bid for Interior secretary.\n\nInstead, Zinke was spending Friday in Alabama, a state with no battleground federal races during this election cycle.\n\nZinke faces several investigations into matters that include his handling of tribal casino permits in Connecticut and his ties to a Montana land deal \u2014 first reported by POLITICO \u2014 that involves the chairman of Halliburton, a major oil services company that stands to benefit from Interior\u2019s expansion of drilling leases.\n\nThe investigations have become a distraction, and some people following the issue said Zinke hasn\u2019t done much to better his lot.\n\nZinke made a risky gambit in recent months, pitching himself to the White House as a potential replacement for outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley despite facing multiple investigations into his conduct, according to a source familiar with the situation. Though the president never seriously considered him as a candidate, the person said, the move caused his opponents inside the White House to start chattering about the investigations.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner were among the people who opposed moving Zinke to the U.N., a former White House official told POLITICO.\n\nSpokespeople for Zinke also may have done him no favors last week when they pointed the finger at the White House and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson for a bizarre episode involving a scuttled attempt to put a political appointee in charge of Interior\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s Office.\n\nEven before that, the ice beneath Zinke\u2019s feet appeared to be thinning with senior White House staff. CNN reported in March that Zinke was one of several Cabinet members called into the White House for lectures about the \u201coptics\u201d of their ethics flaps.\n\nOn the other hand, Zinke has been a favorite of Trump\u2019s, the former White House official said, with the same level of presidential support that former Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt enjoyed before he finally resigned in July. It might take a similarly long stretch of scandals, serious allegations and negative headlines before Trump is willing to cut Zinke loose, the former official said.\n\nHe may face the most serious legal jeopardy from the land development deal in Whitefish, Mont., which involves a group backed by Halliburton Chairman David Lesar and which received a crucial assist from a nonprofit foundation created by Zinke. Zinke and Lesar met in the secretary\u2019s Interior Department office last year before discussing the development project over dinner, POLITICO reported in June.\n\nThe possible legal repercussions could involve anything from anti-bribery statutes down to an assortment of public integrity regulations, depending on whether any evidence exists to support a quid pro quo between Zinke and Lesar, said Scott Amey, general counsel for the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight. But Amey warned that it has become much harder for prosecutors to prove bribery since the Supreme Court tightened the standards in 2016, when they tossed out the corruption conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell.\n\nEven so, Amey said, \u201cthere\u2019s a whole slew of different regs that would put Zinke on the hook that would be a lot easier to prove.\u201d\n\nStill, the embattled chief has supporters. Zinke is \u201ca natural leader\u201d who has an \u201cextraordinary presence,\u201d said Alex Flint, executive director of the Alliance for Market Solutions, who served as Zinke\u2019s sherpa through his Senate confirmation process.\n\nThough he hasn\u2019t spoken to Zinke since July, Flint said he is saddened by the news dogging the Interior boss.\n\n\u201cI watch it somewhat pained because I like him as an individual,\u201d Flint said.\n\nEliana Johnson contributed to this report.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this report incorrectly identified the sponsor and timing of a poll on Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's favorability in Montana.

He was on the road again by midafternoon Friday to West Virginia and Indiana, where he was expected to whip up his supporters with back-to-back combative, high-energy speeches that draw crowds of people who want to witness the Trump show.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of an 11-day rally sprint that Trump has signed himself up for ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections \u2014 the tail end of a travel schedule that has been a slog by design.

In 2016, he successfully branded one of his early GOP rivals, Jeb Bush, as \u201clow energy.\u201d Trump also often mocked Hillary Clinton for lacking \u201cthe stamina\u201d to be president.\n\nTrump\u2019s criticisms of his opponents \u2014 like accusing the media of propagating lies when his speeches and public statements are often rife with inaccuracies \u2014 are often a mirror of his own deficiencies.\n\nBut when it comes to sheer, physical stamina that does not appear to be the case.\n\nTrump\u2019s busy campaign schedule is striking for a 72-year-old man who doesn\u2019t believe in exercise, and whose diet has long relied heavily on well-done steaks, McDonald\u2019s quarter pounders and Diet Coke by the bucket.\n\n\u201cThe guy\u2019s a machine,\u201d said Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, who traveled extensively with him during the 2016 presidential race. Lewandowski insisted that he\u2019s never even seen Trump close his eyes on the plane between stops.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve seen him do is, he\u2019s gone into his cabin,\u201d Lewandowski said of traveling on Trump\u2019s private plane during the 2016 campaign. \u201cBut I know he wasn\u2019t asleep, because when you changed the TV channel, it changed all the channels, and he would change the channel.\u201d\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t seem to sleep much in between his travel days. Last week, the president appeared to be online after 3 a.m., grievance tweeting about his media coverage. Trump has also recently been reaching out to aides early in the morning and late at night with questions about specific states and contests \u2014 asking for gut checks and demanding the latest polling. That would be consistent with the January claim of his then-White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, that Trump needs only 4-5 hours of sleep per night. (\u201c[P]robably one of the reasons why he\u2019s been successful,\u201d Jackson said in a cloyingly flattering news conference about Trump\u2019s health.)\n\nThat fits with Trump\u2019s self-aggrandizing self-image of a vigorous, ageless leader constantly getting things done. During the 2016 campaign, he told Dr. Mehmet Oz that when he looks in the mirror, \u201cI would say I see a person who is 35 years old \u2026. I mean I feel the same.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s breakneck campaign schedule isn\u2019t just about boosting Republican candidates in the midterms, although he has been in great demand for candidates across most of the country. It\u2019s also about competition with the men who have held his office before him, and part of a pass-the-blame strategy if Democrats make big gains on Election Day.\n\n\u201cIt sets up some of the post-election narrative,\u201d one former administration official said. \u201cHe can\u2019t be blamed because he worked so hard, so the blame has to lie elsewhere. If anything, these events are just as much about optics, post-election, as it is about turning out the vote.\u201d\n\nThe White House has made it an explicit priority for Trump to appear at more midterm events than his predecessors Barack Obama and George W. Bush did. When his political shop presented Trump with a late fall campaign schedule back in August, Trump complained that it was too thin. \u201cThis isn\u2019t enough,\u201d he responded, telling to tack on more fundraisers and more rallies, goading them to send him out \u201cas many days as possible.\u201d\n\nSome top Obama advisers don\u2019t seem too worried about being outdone in the category of midterm campaign rallies. \u201cObama understood that making the case was important and necessary,\u201d said his former top adviser, David Axelrod. \u201cBut he also was much more involved in the actual work of governing. Trump lives for the show.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, the midterm campaign offers Trump a window to conduct the presidency that his family members, at least, always thought would be his preferred mode: \u201cMaking America Great Again\u201d out on the road, energizing his followers, while outsourcing the grunt work of foreign and domestic policy to Cabinet officials and aides.\n\nThat model has not exactly come to pass \u2014 even if Trump has shown less gusto in complex national security briefings than he has before large, cheering crowds. But people close to Trump insist that his physical stamina is and always will be one of his greatest assets.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been that way,\u201d said his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. \u201cWhether it\u2019s business or politics, no one will ever outwork him. That\u2019s just who he is.\u201d", "It\u2019s true there were more border arrests in 2018 than in 2017, a development that prompted the president to level blistering criticism against Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. But in 2017, border arrests had dropped to a historic low. | Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images Immigration Immigration crisis? The stats tell a different story To find a year with fewer border arrests than 2017, you'd have to go back all the way to 1971.\n\nThroughout this election season \u2014 and ever since he declared his presidential candidacy \u2014 President Donald Trump has been calling illegal immigration a \u201ccrisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to provide an update to the American people regarding the crisis on our southern border,\u201d the president said in his Thursday speech on the subject, \u201cand crisis it is.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut the numbers tell another story.\n\nThe word \u201ccrisis\u201d typically describes a problem that\u2019s getting worse. According to Customs and Border Protection, arrests along the southwest border \u2014 the standard metric used to calculate illegal border crossings \u2014 numbered 396,579 in fiscal year 2018, which ended Oct. 1. That\u2019s lower than the average over the previous decade (400,751). It\u2019s also lower than the number of border arrests in fiscal 2016, 2014 and 2013.\n\nIt\u2019s true there were more border arrests in 2018 than in 2017, a development that prompted Trump to level blistering criticism against Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, and that led Attorney General Jeff Sessions to impose \u2014 without consulting DHS \u2014 the \u201czero-tolerance\u201d border arrest policy that led to last spring\u2019s surge in family separations.\n\nBut in 2017, border arrests had dropped to a historic low; to find a year with fewer border arrests, you have to go back all the way to 1971. Indeed, a September 2017 report by the Department of Homeland Security was able to boast \u2014 somewhat inconveniently as Trump sought to secure funding for a wall along the southern border \u2014 that \u201cthe southwest land border is more difficult to illegally cross today than ever before.\u201d\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAnd border arrests over the past decade, averaging 400,000 annually, are very low compared with recent history. In the 1980s and 1990s, border arrests seldom fell below 1 million. Border arrests peaked at 1,643,679 in 2000, and remained at or near the 1 million mark until the last two years of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\nTougher border enforcement likely helped explain the decline in border arrests in the late 2000s, but the principal reason, experts agree, was a decline in illegal border crossings by Mexicans attributable initially to improvements in the Mexican economy and later to the Great Recession of 2007-2009.\n\nAfter the recession ended, Mexican border crossings stayed low; in 2017 alone, the population of Mexican-born immigrants in the U.S. dropped more than 300,000, according to an analysis of Census data by the Pew Charitable Trusts. \u201cThe sudden plunge,\u201d Pew reported, \u201cseems to be an acceleration of a long-term trend of native Mexicans returning to their homeland.\u201d\n\nAs Mexican border crossings declined, Central American border crossings increased. According to Pew, the U.S. population from the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala has more than tripled since 1990, accelerating a trend that began in the 1980s with the rise of violence in those countries. But this substantial increase in Central American immigration, most of it illegal, has not come close to offsetting the decline in Mexican immigration.\n\nOne common justification for declaring immigration a crisis rests not on the number of immigrants crossing the border illegally, but on the mayhem they create after they arrive. \u201cRepublicans \u2026 want to make strong borders,\u201d Trump said in his Thursday speech, \u201cwant to get rid of any crime because of the borders, of which there\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nBut study after study has shown that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than the general population. In a March study specifically focused on undocumented immigrants, University of Wisconsin sociologist Michael Light examined the relationship between illegal immigration and violence in 50 states and Washington, D.C., over a 24-year period ending in 2014 \u2014 a span that included the peak years for border arrests. His conclusion: \u201cUndocumented immigration does not increase violence. Rather, the relationship between undocumented immigration and violent crime is generally negative.\u201d\n\nAnother justification to label immigration a crisis is that it lowers wages for native-born workers. But economists have struggled to find evidence of this. George Borjas, a Harvard economist who favors more restrictionist immigration policies, concluded in his 2016 book \u201cWe Wanted Workers\u201d that high school dropouts were the only group of native-born workers that lost significant income (about 3 percent) over the long term as a result of immigration during the peak years of 1990-2010. Individuals who graduated high school but never received a college degree \u2014 a core Trump constituency \u2014 actually experienced long-term wage gains as a result of this immigrant \u201csupply shock,\u201d Borjas found.", "\"A blue wave equals a crime wave.

The administration has said the question will allow the Justice Department to enforce the Voting Rights Act more effectively.\n\nLast week, the justices blocked the questioning of Ross in advance of the trial, but allowed other preparations to continue.\n\nThe judge in the case, U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, said evidence suggests that Ross may have decided to add the question before asking the Justice Department to request it. He also cited proof Ross had overruled senior Census Bureau staff who concluded adding it was very costly and would harm the census count.\n\n\u201cMost significant, the Court found reason to believe that Secretary Ross had provided false explanations of his reasons for, and the genesis of, the citizenship question,\u201d Furman said.\n\nLast month, Ross, in a Justice Department filing, said he now remembers speaking with former senior White House adviser Steve Bannon last year about adding a citizenship question to the census.

It adds that investigators ultimately chose to focus on 31 cases that were all mentioned in a single document, but that it is likely more people were affected.\n\nMany of the passports were apparently taken by an assistant regional security officer looking into passport fraud. Yemen has long been a major source of such fraud, with many Yemenis using false names or untrue kinship claims to gain U.S. citizenship, State officials say.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The magistrate declared a statement Omar signed appeared to have been \"involuntary\" and seemed to have been taken after he was deprived of food, water and needed medication.\n\nThe magistrate also noted that while the department accused Omar of using a false name, it accepted his statement even though he signed it with that same name.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO on Friday that the agency had reviewed the inspector general's report, agreed with its recommended fixes and is implementing them.\n\n\"The integrity and security of the U.S. passport is among our highest priorities,\" the spokesperson said. \"The department takes seriously our responsibility to protect U.S. borders through the vigilant adjudication and processing of U.S. passports.\"\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report does not take a stand on whether any passport fraud claims involved were legitimate or not. But it suggests the process used to take and keep the passports was confused at best and harmful at worst.\n\nFor one thing, the assistant regional security officer confiscated many of the passports after what turned out to be miscommunicated guidance from a paralegal. (The report specifically faults the department for not having a sole legal authority on passport seizures.)\n\nIn several cases, the passports were taken away and held for many months; the department insisted they had simply \u201cretained\u201d the documents, but the inspector general said they had effectively confiscated them. The department also routinely ignored requests for information about their passports from the affected Yemeni-Americans.\n\nThe report notes that all but one of the 31 cases ended up in the passport being revoked, but, while it avoids determining whether the revocations were justified, it points out that some of those revocations were later overturned. The report also says the department could not prove it had properly notified many of the affected Americans about the revocations.\n\nMeanwhile, security in Yemen kept getting worse as rebel and terrorist groups gained territory. The U.S. Embassy in Sana\u2019a ultimately shut down in early 2015, as Iranian-backed Houthi rebels ousted the Yemeni government. A Saudi-led coalition has since tried to restore that government, fueling a war that has left millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation.\n\nIn its official response to the inspector general, State stressed the difficult situation in Yemen and the national security implications of making sure U.S. passports are not misused in explaining why the cases took so long to handle.\n\nThe watchdog wrote back that it \u201cagrees that the cases presented complex questions, but the deteriorating security situation in Yemen and the risks to U.S. citizens remaining there made the resolution of such questions even more urgent.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: State Department\n\nYemen", "\u201cRight now Republicans are all \u2018Look the economy\u2019s so good,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhere do you think that started?

The American Diabetes Association estimates the total cost of diagnosed diabetes, including lost productivity, reached $327 billion in 2017. | Elmer Martinez/AFP/Getty Images Health Care The Diabetes Epidemic: Opportunities and Missed Opportunities A POLITICO working group report.\n\nOne in 3 adults in the United States, about 100 million people, are living with diabetes or prediabetes, according to the CDC. Another case is diagnosed every 21 seconds. The American Diabetes Association estimates the total cost of diagnosed diabetes, including lost productivity, reached $327 billion in 2017, a big jump from $245 billion just five years earlier. That\u2019s roughly one-tenth of the astronomical $3.5 trillion in annual U.S. health expenditures. People with diabetes are at risk for other chronic conditions such as heart disease, as well as dangerous conditions including stroke, amputation, kidney failure and blindness. The challenge is finding ways of preventing diabetes when possible and managing it optimally when prevention fails.\n\nPOLITICO recently convened a working group of policymakers, researchers, clinicians and experts to explore the growing diabetes crisis, and identify challenges, gaps and solutions. Participants included researchers from the National Institutes of Health, PCORI, congressional staff and academic experts, as well as health care providers ranging from endocrinologists to pharmacists and community health workers. In an on-the-record discussion moderated by POLITICO\u2019s executive editor for health care, Joanne Kenen, the group found areas of broad consensus on policy priorities, the research agenda \u2013 and the alarming magnitude of the problem. The conversation mostly focused on Type 2 diabetes, particularly regarding prevention, although some aspects of the discussion particularly surrounding disease management and care coordination apply as well to Type 1. The conversation was held under Chatham House rules. It was on the record, to encourage a free and frank conversation, but comments were not attributed to individual participants. They are listed at the end of this report.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe discussion, outlined in this working paper, looked at prevention and prediabetes; management of early diabetes, and challenges with more advanced cases with serious comorbidities. A few common themes:\n\nPOLITICO Pulse newsletter Get the latest on the health care fight, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\n\u2013 We know less than we think we do about diabetes prevention: Interventions often delay onset of diabetes, but do not ultimately prevent it. And we are not always acting optimally on what we do know.\n\n\u2013 The scientific/nutritional/public health community might have taken a \u201cwrong turn\u201d on food. The emphasis on lowering fat intake to prevent heart disease led to a \u201cdiabetogenic\u201d American diet rich in carbohydrates and sugar.\n\n\u2013 The challenge of diabetes will not be solved individual case by individual case. It requires a comprehensive approach, with care taking place in the community, not just in clinics and hospitals.\n\n\n\n***\n\nPrevention and prediabetes\n\nDiabetes is a silent disease in many respects; people often do not know they have it until a crisis hits. One in 4 adults with diabetes have not been diagnosed. (Prediabetes also is not detected in a timely manner.) This is a huge missed opportunity. The health care system must do a better job of preventing diabetes \u2013 and identifying prediabetes when disease can still be averted or reversed.\n\nPrevention requires a holistic approach to lifestyle, nutrition and exercise. But that goes beyond changing individual behavior (which is hard to do.) It requires attitudinal shifts across entire populations and communities.\n\nIn addition, more people are being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes at a young age, including many women who experienced gestational diabetes (once thought to be less of a risk factor) during pregnancy.\n\nTakeaways\n\nDiabetes prevention requires a more effective population health approach, taking into account social determinants of health including poverty and availability/affordability of healthy food.\n\nThe prevention research agenda must focus on diabetes in younger people, and on the recently recognized risks for women with gestational diabetes and their children.\n\n\u201cThis epidemic of type 2 in kids, this is a huge societal problem and we don\u2019t yet have research that proves how to deal with that. It\u2019s an area we need to invest in,\u201d one participant said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really scary is that the offspring of those women who have had gestational diabetes are more likely to be obese and to have factors that put them at risk for Type 2 diabetes, and that\u2019s the population that we don\u2019t have an effective way to treat,\u201d said another.\n\nBehavior change is hard \u2013 and we can\u2019t \u201cblame the victim\u201d for unhealthy eating or lack of exercise, particularly \u201cif they\u2019re working two or three jobs to get by,\u201d as one clinician put it.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t put the onus on the person, if they live in an unsafe neighborhood, or if [they can\u2019t afford] healthy food. The health care system that will pay for hospitalizations, emergency care and amputations won\u2019t pay for prevention. And behavioral modification is hard.\u201d\n\nIn medicine and policy, we undervalue preventive care and early intervention. Yet we also overestimate how effective prevention has been; most of the \u201csuccessful\u201d prevention programs did not in fact prevent diabetes, although they did delay it significantly.\n\n\u201cWe never think about that child who is born with no \u2018diagnosis.\u2019 They don\u2019t get services until they\u2019re labeled \u2018obese.\u2019 They don\u2019t get services until they\u2019re labeled \u2018pre-hypertensive.\u2019 They don\u2019t get services until \u2026 \u2018Oh, this person is diabetic.\u2019 \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to have to have an amputation.\u2019 They\u2019re going to get everything now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you overestimate how much we know. I think you overestimate how successful the diabetes prevention program was,\u201d said one person. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to follow those people now for over 15 years. Most of those people who got that lifestyle intervention, which was 16 individual sessions with motivational interviewing, the best we could possibly throw at them, most of those people now have diabetes.\u201d\n\nYet participants noted that it\u2019s essential to remember that sustained, committed, multi-pronged public health or population programs can and have worked. The fight against tobacco use has shown that.\n\n\u201cThere are excellent models of mass population behavior change. In the United States in 1964,\n\n44 percent of the adult population smoked. That\u2019s now down to about 15 percent. For most of those years smoking was the most heavily marketed product in our country. It was highly addictive, it was socially acceptable, and yet, we were able to get people to change. And the way we got people to change is not with magic bullets but not with one or two best practices but with a comprehensive campaign of approaches.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nEarly diabetes\n\nFew people are diagnosed with diabetes and only diabetes; most diabetics already have other conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, increasing the risk of stroke and heart disease. They can still be managed \u2013 and much of this can be done in a primary care setting. But focusing only on diabetes misses the fuller picture \u2013 and sometimes diabetes gets short shrift in primary care because the other conditions pose a more immediate or, as one working group participant put it, a \u201clouder\u201d threat.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. has a shortage of primary care doctors \u2013 and these doctors face tremendous time pressures to address a host of conditions and needs during brief office visits. Under traditional fee for service, panelists noted, the doctors are not paid for the time they spend talking to patients and coaching them on diabetes management \u2013 or even to make sure they follow up with diabetes education and management classes and consults to learn about nutrition, lifestyle changes and medication.\n\n\u201c... It\u2019s relatively straightforward, lifestyle modification, send them to a diabetes educator if the insurance covers it, send them to a nutritionist if the insurance covers it, but sometimes it\u2019s a challenge to get them to those. So, the primary care physician becomes their nutritionist, becomes their diabetes educator \u2013 even though he or she doesn\u2019t have the time.\u201d\n\nTakeaways\n\nInvest more in primary care \u2013 broadly defined.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a team-based sport and it\u2019s not just the doctor. We recognize that. And there are other members of the team that can contribute things that the physician cannot.\u201d\n\nExpand community-based and community-rooted care, be it through diabetes educators, peer-to-peer counseling or community health workers who understand the day-to-day environment and realities. It\u2019s the community health workers, not the endocrinologist, who will know how to work with the patient who says, \u201cI can\u2019t even focus on a healthy meal because I just got evicted.\u201d Build bridges between the community care, and the clinic and hospitals. Recognize that community pharmacists \u2013 there are still a lot of neighborhood drug stores \u2013 are a trusted but underutilized resource in diabetes and medication management and education.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve done is really bring in an intentional community health advocate or community health worker practice model in our system. \u2026 We\u2019ve really not just said, \u2018We\u2019ll go in the community and figure that out,\u2019 but we\u2019ve managed them from the bedside, out, back home, to make sure that they\u2019re having a robust clinical care model that really has an impact. And so, we brought the community inside and taken it back outside.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody gets that the clinic walls are not the boundaries of health care, that primary care has to merge much more closely with the community, that out in the community there are not only the problems that cause disease but also the answers for managing it if we can tap into them.\u201d\n\nAct sooner, rather than later, clinicians and researchers urged.\n\n\u201cGetting to these conditions that are going to progress earlier is much better. The condition is \u2013 and the associated conditions are \u2013 more reversible at that time, and we actually have lots of evidence now that behaviors as well as more drastic measures can reverse diabetes at an early stage.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nManaging advanced disease\n\nDiabetes is a continuum, as one panelist summed it up. Patients spend perhaps a decade with prediabetes and a decade with early diabetes that might be controlled just with diet or metformin (a safe and inexpensive generic drug) before the condition progresses. Patients need more (and more expensive) medications, more management and eventually insulin.\n\nAnd there are more complications than much of the public understands. Diabetes\n\nincreases the risk of numerous other illnesses, including dementia and heart disease. In traditional fee-for-service medicine, there\u2019s often no quarterback to oversee a patient\u2019s overall care. No one is in charge. The oncologists can\u2019t adjust the insulin in a patient who, pre-chemo, never needed insulin. The cardiologist is looking at blood vessels, not blood sugar. The neurologist isn\u2019t asking whether a patient with early Alzheimer\u2019s can manage their diabetes drugs. Nor are there enough endocrinologists to go around. The ongoing (albeit still slow) transition from fee-for-service medicine to alternative payment systems should reward care management, prevention and earlier intervention. But there are plenty of unknowns \u2013 and even among the more developed programs, room for improvement. As one participant noted, in 2015 only 20 percent of all Medicare Advantage plans \u2013 supposedly the most integrated care available \u2013 had a five-star rating on diabetes management.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things we know that improve diabetes. They can reduce complications, but they have been expensive, so we also have to look at that.\u201d\n\nTakeaways\n\nTreat the patient, not the pancreas. Treat tomorrow\u2019s crisis, today.\n\n\u201cDiabetes is a quiet disease. This is very important. And I think it goes into the psychology of patients, how they behave. If diabetes was a loud disease \u2013 I call the others loud diseases, like heart attack \u2013 it would have gotten the attention it deserves. It\u2019s very easy for people in the midst of prioritization to ignore diabetes, [push it] to the back as if nothing is happening. So, there\u2019s a psychological component. How do we push it into the front of their attention rather than keeping it in the background?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some health care systems, they\u2019re starting to realize that it\u2019s really expensive when people keep showing up at the emergency room. So, for those really expensive patients they\u2019re starting to give people help; they\u2019re starting to have people call them and encourage them to take care of themselves. But, you know, this should be delivered much more broadly. And I think as we get away from fee-for-service and as we get into managed health care plans, plans then have the freedom to do what\u2019s effective.\n\nParticipants said there\u2019s enough money in the $3.5 trillion health care system to address diabetes \u2013 but it\u2019s not being spent correctly. It\u2019s probably worth studying and trying to adapt some cost-effective models developed overseas.\n\n\u201cWe have enough dollars. They just are being spent in completely crazy ways, including the cost of these drugs, and some of the costs of these interventions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are international models of \u2018frugal intervention\u2019 \u2013 the world is facing diabetes too, it\u2019s not just a U.S. problem. In many countries now, too, you are facing the dual burden \u2026 trying to figure out how to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases.\u201d\n\nThe research agenda must be broad and comprehensive. There\u2019s not enough accurate, certain science on food and nutrition \u2013 and the public may end up discounting such advice when it keeps changing. More needs to be learned about preventing \u2013 not just delaying \u2013 diabetes onset. Researchers need to examine which drugs \u2013 new and old \u2013 are cost effective and determine the optimal time for patients to start them.\n\nAbove all, it\u2019s important to understand that preventing and managing diabetes \u2013 which encompasses managing weight \u2013 isn\u2019t just about diabetes. It\u2019s the prism for a healthier America.\n\n\u201cDiabetes is really sort of a gateway disease and a model for chronic care. People with diabetes are at increased risk for practically everything you can think of, you know, from heart disease to cancer to cognitive dysfunction to incontinence, depression, you name it. So, when you start to think about a model of integrated care, diabetes is the perfect disease to [address]\n\nIt\u2019s not the diabetes per se; it\u2019s all the behaviors that make you healthy.\u201d\n\nParticipants included:\n\nOLUWARANTI AKIYODE, PharmD, associate professor, Advanced Diabetes manager, Howard University Hospital Diabetes Treatment Center\n\nOLENGA ANABUI, director, Penn Center for Community Health Workers\n\nLAUDAN Y.

Racist. Anti-American. An inhumane and expensive boondoggle. Critics of Donald Trump\u2019s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border see it as a disaster in the making, and some of these Trump administration opponents seem willing to reject paying for a wall at all costs. \u201cIt happens to be like a manhood issue for the president, building a wall, and I\u2019m not interested in that,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in mid-October at a Harvard Institute of Politics discussion, after she told one attendee that she would be willing to trade \u201cnothing\u201d in exchange for the wall.\n\nBut, why? When it comes to immigration, Democrats should take heed of the bigger picture and bend rather than break on the smaller issues\u2014like the wall. If Democrats are interested in a more humane immigration policy as a whole, they should push for a higher refugee ceiling and a simultaneous enhancement of border security to help more people and those who are most in need. A more humane immigration agenda would certainly also include a stop to the forcible separation of children and parents (ended for now, but reportedly being reconsidered by the Trump administration) and a fix for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to make sure that immigrants who have barely known their country of origin can\u2019t be deported. And such a plan would also ensure that no immigrant is turned away on the basis of gender, religion, race or ethnicity. These concerns are much larger than any kind of human rights concerns posed by the wall, and Democrats should trade the wall for solutions on some of them instead.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFirst, ignoring Americans\u2019 widespread concerns over immigration and border enforcement is politically unsustainable. Rising nationalism around the world will not soon disappear, and the number of global migrants is likely to rise\u2014not fall\u2014in the future. In the United States, illegal immigration was the highest-rated concern among Republican voters in polling released on October 15. In Europe, voters in 21 of 28 countries surveyed cited immigration as the top issue facing the continent, despite steadily decreasing migrant arrivals. If real steps aren\u2019t taken to manage the numbers of migrants, then the public backlash will increase and anti-immigrant platforms and candidates will continue to win elections. Eventually, the politicians elected on these sentiments will obtain enough power to severely cut immigration and make it difficult to reverse course, as we\u2019ve seen across Europe in recent years with the popularity of anti-immigrant candidates in Germany, Italy and Hungary. In the end, fewer migrants will be allowed to legally enter the United States, and American economic interests and global stability\u2014not to mention the human lives caught in the political crossfire\u2014will suffer.\n\nThe wall is Trump\u2019s defining immigration obsession, the rallying cry at his campaign events and the symbol of his naked appeals to nativism and racism. It also happens to pose the least humanitarian concern out of his whole immigration agenda. Democrats should let him have it\u2014and watch as the toxic anti-immigrant politics that Trump has fueled begin to fade.\n\nAfter the election, Democrats will have plenty of opportunity, with a threatened government shutdown in December and the promise of a post-midterm fight over the border wall, to trade funding for the wall for other immigration wins, such as increasing the number of refugees the United States admits, curbing harsh immigration enforcement, fixing DACA and boosting aid to the troubled Central American countries whose citizens are fleeing north to escape violence and poverty.\n\nRaising the refugee cap is essential for a smarter immigration policy: In the past fiscal year, the United States admitted its lowest number of refugees in 40 years and has set a historically low cap for next year at a time when there has never been more refugees in the world. (More than 68 million people, larger than the populations of France or the United Kingdom, are currently displaced globally.) Washington is shirking its global responsibility, placing the burden on the shoulders of poorer countries, like Lebanon, Jordan and Uganda, that are ill-equipped to handle large numbers of displaced people. Politically, Democrats should also emphasize the fact that all refugees are heavily vetted before entering the United States and that there is no evidence that refugees who have been admitted heighten the risk of terrorist acts\u2014homegrown terrorists pose a much greater threat.\n\nDemocrats should also focus more of their attention on a permanent solution for the so-called Dreamers, or DACA recipients, and curbing overzealous immigration enforcement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and going back to treating immigration violations as civil offenses rather than criminal ones. The hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children should be offered a path to citizenship.\n\nAny long-term immigration deal between the parties should also provide effective security assistance to reduce violence in other countries, because without addressing what migration experts call \u201cpush\u201d factors\u2014a lack of economic opportunity or gang violence in a migrant\u2019s country of origin, for instance\u2014border and interior immigration enforcement can go only so far in deterring migration. Under Trump, U.S. assistance to Central America has been cut\u2014and he is threatening to make further cuts\u2014but any immigration policy that seeks to quell the influx of migrants coming from those countries would be incomplete without restoring that funding, or, even better, increasing it.\n\nDemocrats may not be able to get all of these things, but stonewalling on Trump\u2019s wall is a waste of their energy when it comes to combating the far less symbolic immigration crises facing the country.\n\nIt is in America\u2019s national interest to design a more forward-looking migration policy. In fact, the United States will need more (not less) migration to address its looming demographic challenges. Fertility rates are at record lows. The nation\u2019s ratio of retirement-age seniors to working-age adults is expected to rise, from 25 seniors per every 100 working-age adults in 2017 to 35 per 100 in 2030\u2014and it will keep rising. Barring major reductions to Social Security and Medicare, there will not be enough workers to financially support the elderly in the future without increases in immigration.\n\nAnd even if it didn\u2019t ultimately serve our economic and social interests, neither party would be able to stop migration to the United States. While the United States and other wealthy countries are aging, and less able to fill available jobs, many developing countries are young with rapidly growing populations, most of whose members need jobs. This will increase the pressure to migrate from poor to rich countries\u2014yet one more reason for Washington to develop a sustainable migration policy.\n\nThat inevitability sets us up for a political standoff. Allowing more open borders is politically infeasible, but trying to block immigration with no attention to the causes that drive it is unrealistic. A more sustainable, long-term solution for Democrats would be to strengthen border enforcement while treating the root causes of migration and maintaining a commitment to a welcoming immigration and asylum system overall. President Barack Obama adopted a tough enforcement policy as well, but he did so relatively quietly\u2014it\u2019s safe to assume that Trump will not be quiet about building a wall. This should be enough noise to ease the fears of immigration, providing cover for durable humanitarian gains.\n\nThe price of building a wall is well worth paying if it facilitates a new and sustainable U.S. immigration policy.\n\nDavid Kampf is a senior Ph.D. fellow at the Center for Strategic Studies at The Fletcher School.", "Google's relationship with Washington has become increasingly strained in the last years of Susan Molinari's tenure. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Technology Head of Google's Washington office stepping aside\n\nFormer Republican Rep.

Google refused to send its CEO to a September hearing despite requests from Senate Intelligence Committee leaders, drawing the ire of lawmakers who opted to sit an empty chair at the witness table rather than hear from a more junior executive.\n\nThe company has also found itself in Republicans' cross-hairs over accusations that its liberal-leaning workforce suppresses conservative viewpoints in its search results. President Donald Trump tweeted in August that Google's news search was \"RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD\" because it served up news outlets like CNN in its top results.\n\n\"Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see.

The company staunchly opposed legislation that makes internet companies more liable for knowingly facilitating sex trafficking on their platforms because it carved an exception out of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That statute has for more than two decades shielded Google and others from legal accountability for things their users post, keeping them from being hit with costly, possibly fatal civil or criminal penalties and thereby helping them become the juggernauts they are today. The bill amending Section 230 become law earlier this year.\n\nAnd the company will also soon face a battle over consumer privacy regulation. Lawmakers of both parties have pledged comprehensive privacy legislation in the next Congress. Google has signaled an openness to federal rules, but it's likely to clash with consumer groups and certain lawmakers over what those rules should include and what responsibility companies must shoulder.\n\nWhat's more, Google's antitrust woes in Europe could make their way stateside.

The argument is classic Trump, who despite making the midterms a referendum on his own presidency, has a history of personalizing and then dwelling on his victories while distancing himself and diverting attention from his losses.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nShould Republicans pick up Senate seats, \u201cthat\u2019s all they\u2019ll talk about,\u201d said Barry Bennett, a presidential adviser on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s where the math is in our favor.\u201d\n\nEven in the House, where Republicans are laboring to sustain their 23-seat majority, the White House is already dismissing any notion of a Democratic wave election on par with the Republican midterm pickups under former presidents Barack Obama or Bill Clinton.\n\nCounselor to the president Kellyanne Conway this week on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d pointed to the 43 Republican House retirements as a major reason the GOP was likely to lose seats. She also tried to contrast the expected GOP losses with drubbings previous Democratic presidents have received. \u201cNo nonpartisan, sane prognosticator right now is predicting the 63 House seat losses that President Obama suffered in his first midterms in 2010, or even the 54\u201d that Clinton lost in his first midterms in 1994, which gave Republicans the House for the first time in 40 years, she said.\n\nA recent internal memo by White House political director Bill Stepien similarly contended that House Republicans\u2019 goal this year is to minimize their losses.\n\n\u201cWe do what we can with the situation,\u201d a White House official said, using language similar to the memo, which cast the scenario for House Republicans as \u201cchallenging.\u201d\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

I\u2019ve campaigned for a lot of candidates that were down a little bit and now they're up,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, Trump added: \u201cI think we're doing really extraordinarily well in the Senate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for White House officials to lower expectations ahead of the midterms. Prior to the 2010 elections, Democratic leaders like then-DNC chairman Sen. Tim Kaine warned early about the \u201ctough\u201d year ahead. Obama at times seemed exasperated by what he referred to as a \u201cbig, messy democracy\u201d while campaigning for fellow Democrats. Top aides said Obama would not personalize expected losses, but the president nonetheless limped out of what he called a \u201cshellacking,\u201d saying he felt \u201chumbled\u201d by his party\u2019s worst showing at the polls in decades.\n\nSitting presidents\u2019 parties have collectively picked up just seven Senate seats over the last 80 years in midterm elections. So Trump confidants have been arguing that because these Senate gains have been so infrequent, boosting the Republican majority in the Senate would be meaningful enough to blot out Democratic gains in the House.\n\n\u201cIf the president picks up Senate seats, they\u2019ll be no honest people talking about a \u2018blue wave,\u2019\u201d Matt Schlapp, a Trump ally and chairman of the American Conservative Union, told POLITICO.\n\nAnother reason some think the Senate argument will stick is because of what\u2019s at stake: The Senate approves Supreme Court justices, federal judges and confirms appointees, so retaining the majority will allow the GOP to pursue major parts of the Trump agenda even under a divided government.\n\nRepublicans say they are also preparing to cast their hold on the upper chamber as a setback for the Democratic senators who are likely to run in 2020, especially after some of them were weaved into GOP ads targeting their red-state colleagues.\n\nOne Republican ad against Democrat Phil Bredesen in the Tennessee Senate race featured clips of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts with the word \u201cANGRY\u201d on the screen, casting her and Democrats as \u201cRAGING\u201d and \u201cHUNGRY FOR POWER,\u201d using the fight over Trump\u2019s newly minted Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as an example.\n\n\u201cA Republican gain in the Senate is a rebuke of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker,\u201d said Brad Todd, a GOP consultant working on the midterms, citing the Democratic senators frequently being floated as 2020 presidential hopefuls. \u201cThe Democrats in the Senate became the face of the opposition to Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nThe strategy dovetails with anticipation in the White House that Trump will quickly shift into reelection mode after Election Day, assailing his opponents before they can get out of the starting blocks. He has already spent months going after Warren and Booker, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden. Current and former presidential aides said Trump has been rearing to shift to 2020 attack mode on a full-time basis.\n\n\u201cIn the mind of the president, 2018 is simply an extension of 2020,\u201d a former White House official said. \u201cThe reelection campaign began long ago, whether the press and the public realized it, or not.\u201d", "POLITICO Playbook PM: Amid Trump immigration push, economy booms Presented by\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Columbia, Mo., on Thursday. | Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nTHINK ABOUT THIS \u2026 THE ECONOMY added a quarter-million jobs in October, and pretty much all that\u2019s coming out of the White House is talk of a plan to militarize the southern border with Mexico, a change asylum laws, build a border wall and make immigration into the U.S. far more restrictive.

Joe Donnelly accepted the endorsement of Victor Oladipo, an NBA All-Star for the Indiana Pacers, on a Friday night last month. In front of 2,300 people at the Hammond Civic Center, Oladipo\u2014an Indiana University alum born to Nigerian immigrants and a native of Silver Spring, Md.\u2014urged attendees to vote for Donnelly over his Republican challenger Mike Braun. \u201cI call everybody from the state of Indiana my adopted family, because at the end of the day, this state believed in me when no one else did,\u201d said Oladipo, whose name has been in the local news media recently for performing acts of kindness, such as holding open the door of a Chick-Fil-A for an elderly lady and writing a letter to an 8-year-old cancer patient.\n\nThe endorsement splashed across multiple news cycles here in \u201cbasketball-crazed Indianoplace,\u201d as Hillary Clinton once called us in a 2010 email to then-State Department aide Jake Sullivan. The Indianapolis Star\u2019s right-leaning columnist, Tim Swarens, wrote a piece suggesting that \u201cOladipo has a future in politics, if he wants it.\u201d The Star\u2019s Trump-supporting cartoonist, Gary Varvel, drew an image of Oladipo hoisting Donnelly\u2019s hand against the backdrop of an American flag, as a man in the audience asked a woman next to him: \u201cWho is the guy with Victor Oladipo?\u201d Though he hasn\u2019t yet reached the superstardom of former Pacers\u2019 guard Reggie Miller, Oladipo\u2019s presence on the trail so overshadowed the rest of the proceedings that the question the cartoon posed might as well have applied to Donnelly\u2019s other surrogate in town that night: former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn netting (sorry) Oladipo\u2019s endorsement, Donnelly became yet another in a long line of Indiana pols who have used basketball to appeal to Hoosier voters. Basketball has shaped the state\u2019s perception nationally more than perhaps anything else. As the Pacers\u2019 sideline at Bankers Life Fieldhouse reads: \u201cWe grow basketball here.\u201d \u201cIn 49 states, it\u2019s just basketball,\u201d goes another saying. \u201cThis is Indiana.\u201d With Oladipo, Donnelly may have checked\u2014or maybe even surpassed\u2014Trump\u2019s get of Bobby Knight, the former Indiana University coach who endorsed the president in the state\u2019s 2016 Republican primary.\n\nThe coach called \u201cthe General\u201d has become made-for-MAGA-rally fodder whenever the president visits the state. At the time, Trump called it \u201cthe greatest endorsement in the history of Indiana.\u201d On Friday, the president announced Knight would be a \u201csecret\u201d guest at his rally in Southport, Indiana, that evening, raising the possibility that the coach could endorse Braun and once again play a pivotal role in an Indiana race. But Knight\u2019s stock in Indiana has dropped as Oladipo\u2019s has risen. After the April premiere of The Last Days of Knight, an ESPN documentary about the coach\u2019s firing from IU, WTHR columnist Bob Kravitz called Knight an \u201cunrepentant bully\u201d who \u201cfailed to change with the times.\u201d \u201cGene Keady legend grows as Bob Knight\u2019s continues to shrink,\u201d read the headline of a March 23 column by the Star\u2019s Gregg Doyel. The piece compared the former Purdue University basketball coach, who also endorsed Trump during the primary, to Knight. \u201cThe record book will suggest Bob Knight was a better coach than Gene Keady, and maybe he was,\u201d Doyel wrote. \u201cBut as far as being a human being? Knight couldn\u2019t hold Keady\u2019s jock.\u201d The column dropped days before Trump would return to the state again this past May to campaign with Braun.\n\nIn an episode reported here for the first time, Republican Sen. Todd Young rebuffed efforts by national GOP operatives who repeatedly encouraged him to seek Knight\u2019s endorsement in the 2016 campaign, according to a Republican with knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity. This came even as Young faced a tough race against Democrat Evan Bayh. That Young declined to embrace Knight is evidence that the coach might not always be a slam dunk\u2014again, my apologies\u2014for a candidate, even in the Hoosier state. (Young did receive and tout the endorsement of three-time Indy 500 winner Johnny Rutherford, a fellow Marine.)\n\nIn 49 states, it may be just basketball. But this is Indiana. \u201cBasketball is in our DNA,\u201d says Kip Tew, a lifelong fan of the game, an IU alum and a Democratic lobbyist in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s central to our culture as a state. Every politician tries to capitalize on that one thing we have in common.\u201d\n\nBut the zeitgeist of basketball is shifting in Indiana, away from the chair-throwing, player-choking Knight and toward woke players like Oladipo, who represents basketball\u2019s urbanization and internationalization. Oladipo plays America\u2019s soft power export, the second-most popular game in the world. Invented by a Canadian-born gym teacher, basketball now draws foreign workers back into the United States and is an engine of assimilation for them, whether Yao Ming, Dirk Nowitzki, Joel Embiid or Giannis Antetokounmpo. Basketball is Indiana\u2019s best cultural export, and this state\u2014like many others\u2014is benefiting from its trade with other countries, a part of basketball\u2019s global identity in the new century that\u2019s in tension with Trumpism.\n\nHoosiers still embrace the \u201cMilan Miracle\u201d that inspired the 1986 Gene Hackman movie Hoosiers, but now we also celebrate the Crispus Attucks Tigers, the team that just a year after the Milan Miracle became the first all-black program to win the Indiana State High School Basketball Championship.\n\n\n\n***\n\nNot long after James Naismith, a physical education teacher, invented the game in Massachusetts in 1891, basketball grew roots as deep as Indiana\u2019s corn. \u201cBasketball really had its origin in Indiana, which remains the center of the sport,\u201d Naismith later observed. In 1911, the state adopted its storied single-class state high school tournament, which gave birth to the Milan Miracle, when the high school team from the small town of Milan (enrollment: 161) upset Muncie Central (enrollment: 1,600) in 1954.\n\nSince then, pandering to basketball has become as time-honored a political ritual as noshing on a tenderloin at the Indiana State Fair. \u201cI agree, and I plead guilty to that,\u201d says former Rep. Lee Hamilton, a Democrat who is also a member of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cI was in the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame because I was a member of Congress, and I was in Congress because I was in the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame.\u201d (His dry one-liner more or less checks out: Voters in Indiana\u2019s 9th Congressional District first elected Hamilton to the House in 1965, 17 years before his induction into the hall of fame, thanks to his all-state performance at Evansville Central High School, and his turn as the DePauw University Tigers\u2019 outstanding senior in 1952.)\n\nHere is a brief but by no means exhaustive history of politicians trying to score points with Indiana voters both on and off the court: In 1989, three years after Hoosiers, Gov. Evan Bayh added a basketball hoop at the Governor\u2019s Residence. On a Saturday morning this past August, popular Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb unveiled an entire basketball court on the grounds of the Governor\u2019s Residence that would host youth and community basketball events. Holcomb also has shot a basket in all 92 of Indiana\u2019s counties. This Halloween, he dressed as a Pacer and handed out minibasketballs. Vice President Mike Pence, a former Indiana governor, had a basketball court installed on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory, complete with the logo from the movie. In 2003, Gov. Mitch Daniels announced his gubernatorial campaign at Butler University Hinkle Fieldhouse, where the movie\u2019s climactic game was shot. He announced his reelection bid there as well. Daniels also used the Milan Miracle as a metaphor for the state\u2019s comeback.\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign played off the state\u2019s love affair with the game, thanks in part to the former president\u2019s adeptness at the game and the guidance of Tew, Obama\u2019s state senior adviser in 2008. On April 25, after a rally in Kokomo, Obama played a three-on-three game at Maple Crest Middle School. During the primary, Tew and other staffers also arranged for Obama to tour the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame with George McGinnis, the ABA and NBA star and Washington High School standout. Before the first presidential debate, David Plouffe attempted to set debate prep at the French Lick Resort, where he would play hoops with Hall of Famer Larry Bird, \u201cThe Hick from French Lick.\u201d Bird ultimately decided against getting involved in presidential politics that year, and advisers scuttled the plan. That year, Obama won the state in November.\n\nBut basketball is not a panacea for an unpopular candidate, or one who fails to embrace basketball in an authentic way. In 2000, a clip surfaced on local television featuring a Republican gubernatorial candidate, David McIntosh, playing basketball awkwardly. Gov. Frank O\u2019Bannon challenged McIntosh to a three-on-three game. McIntosh declined. \u201cWe have an obligation to Hoosier voters everywhere to talk about taxes first and then to play basketball,\u201d a McIntosh spokesperson said at the time. That didn\u2019t work out well for McIntosh. \u201cHe was humiliated, and we spent the rest of the campaign continually challenging him to all manner of basketball competitions to remind voters he wasn\u2019t an authentic Hoosier,\u201d Tew, who advised O\u2019Bannon\u2019s campaign, recounted in his book about Obama's 2008 campaign, Journey to Blue. \u201cIt hurt him, even among his base.\u201d\n\nThere was also the brief and ill-fated 2002 secretary of state campaign of Kent Benson, a Knight product from IU and the No. 1 pick in the 1977 NBA draft. Despite his notoriety on the court, he couldn\u2019t shake financial problems to get traction on the trail and dropped out.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s legendary metaphorical air ball in May 2016. Cruz routinely quoted Hoosiers at campaign stops around the state. But at a rally at the Hoosiers Gym in Knightstown, Cruz had an aide measure the hoop, recreating a famous scene from the flick. \u201cYou know the amazing thing is, that basketball ring here in Indiana is the same height as it is in New York City and every other place in this country,\u201d Cruz said. Ring? Clank. Cruz made himself the object of ridicule for days. He lost the state\u2019s primary to the Knight-endorsed Trump.\n\nIn recent years, basketball has become perhaps the most liberal-minded game in American sports, led by players like Beto-hat-wearing LeBron James and Trump-critic coaches like Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors and Greg Popovich, a native of East Chicago, Ind., of the San Antonio Spurs. As the sport has tilted from Knight to Pop, the way the game is celebrated in Indiana has changed in similar ways. The Crispus Attucks Tigers, the first all-black team to win the state high school championship, was initially shunned by official Indiana. When they won the state championship in 1955, buoyed by all-time great Oscar Robertson, who later played for the NBA\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks, they didn\u2019t get the customary celebration on Monument Circle after a team ride on a fire truck, for fear of fights breaking out. The Tigers became the first Indianapolis-area school to win the state title\u2014and the first black school in the nation to win an open state tournament. The historic victory, though, has often been eclipsed by the fictional Hickory Hoosiers and that of the actual Milan team that inspired the film. In 2015, a group of Indiana lawmakers attempted to right that wrong: Then-Sen. Dan Coats and Donnelly honored the Tigers on the floor of the U.S. Senate, while Rep. Andre Carson did the same in the House. This week, Donnelly tweeted a two-minute video endorsement from Bill Hampton, the guard for the 1955 Tigers. It features grainy black and white video of that year\u2019s championship game.\n\nNBC\u2019s coverage of the 2000 NBA Finals between the Indiana Pacers and the Los Angeles Lakers included a tight shot of a chain-link basketball hoop against a blue sky, before widening to reveal a red tractor and a barn and two white boys playing basketball near a dog that mills about. \u201cIf you created the perfect basketball fable, it might begin in a small town in Indiana, where kids grow up with a ball in one hand, a basket out back, and dreams of glory in their heads,\u201d Bob Costas said in the voice-over. But Indiana, like the rest of the nation, is becoming increasingly urban, and that fable could just as easily play out on a neighborhood court on the Eastside of Indianapolis. According to the most recent 2010 Census, less than 14 percent of Hoosiers\u2014891,906\u2014live in rural counties. That\u2019s compared to 62 percent, or about 4 million, who live in urban counties.\n\n\u201cFor years and years, the movie Hoosiers was the iconic image of Indiana basketball,\u201d Kravitz, the Indianapolis sports columnist, told me. Now there\u2019s room for the Tigers, and for Oladipo.\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhen Rep. Jim Banks, an Indiana Republican, entered the Oval Office and met Donald Trump for the first time last March, Trump asked the Indiana University alumnus and Hoosiers basketball fan a question. \u201cYou got to tell me, did Bobby Knight or Mike Pence get me more votes in Indiana?\u201d Trump asked Banks, according to the congressman. Banks, at the White House that day with other members of the Republican Study Committee to discuss changes to the American Health Care Act, took the question in stride.\n\n\u201cNo question that Bobby Knight won the primary for you,\u201d replied Banks, somewhat in jest, while standing next to the vice president, whom he had requested appear in the post-meeting photo op.\n\n\u201cBobby Knight is such a great man\u2014great man,\u201d Trump said to Banks, the congressman told me in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cI went to IU largely so I could go to basketball games,\u201d Banks, whom Trump invited on stage at an event with the Future Farmers of America in October, told me. \u201cI was a student at Indiana University when [Knight] was fired. Basketball is ingrained in our Hoosier spirit, and the president tapped into that uniquely with Bobby Knight, who is the most storied legend and figure we have in college basketball. Bobby Knight is a mixed bag, of course. But to many of us, he made Indiana basketball what it is, what it always will be, and President Trump, as a candidate, recognized that.\u201d\n\nBut for every person like Banks who says Knight helped cement Trump\u2019s primary win in Indiana, you\u2019ll find another here who claims it was tin-eared\u2014especially as the coach\u2019s relationship with his former university has soured. \u201cI've always really enjoyed the fans and I always will,\u201d Knight said on \u201cThe Dan Patrick show\u201d in a March 2017 interview. \u201cOn my dying day, I will think about how great the fans at Indiana were. As far as the hierarchy at Indiana University at that time, I have absolutely no respect whatsoever for those people. With that in mind, I have no interest in ever going back to that university.\u201d He added later in the interview: \u201cI hope they are all dead.\u201d Some were dead, Patrick pointed out. \u201cWell, I hope the rest of them go,\u201d Knight said.\n\n\u201cBob Knight is an angry old man and he has lost his relevance in this state,\u201d Tew says. \u201cThe Venn Diagram of Trump and Bob Knight supporters is a circle.\u201d\n\nKnight is Trump\u2019s basketball avatar. Trumpism and Knightism are inextricable: Win until you are tired of winning, and then win some more. The two also weather crises similarly. In 1992, when Knight fake-bullwhipped Calbert Cheaney, a black small forward and shooting guard from Evansville who was bent over at practice, a photograph of it sparked outrage. In a Trumpian defense, Kit Klingelhoffer, a spokesman for the program at the time, chalked it up as a joke. Knight offered neither an apology nor a comment. And in a 1988 NBC News interview with Connie Chung, when asked about coping with stress, Knight said: \u201cI think that if rape is inevitable, relax and enjoy it.\u201d Knight tried to talk his way past the remark in real time. \u201cThat\u2019s just an old term that you\u2019re going to use. The plane\u2019s down, so you have no control over it. I\u2019m not talking about that, about the act of rape. Don\u2019t misinterpret me there. But what I\u2019m talking about is, something happens to you, so you have to handle it\u2014now.\u201d (Chung shared her story of sexual assault in the 1960s earlier this fall, during Senate hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh.)\n\n\u201cI really have no interest in discussing Bob Knight,\u201d Dan Dakich, an Indianapolis-based ESPN analyst and Knight\u2019s former assistant for 12 seasons at Indiana University, told me this fall. Dakich is a Trump supporter but has broken with Knight, calling him a \u201cmiserable human being.\u201d On Nov. 9, 2016, at 9:38 a.m., Dakich tweeted about Trump\u2019s election: \u201cThe people not the media or special interests have spoken.\u201d\n\nEven Banks admitted that Donnelly\u2019s Oladipo endorsement was a coup on Twitter: \u201cIf @VicOladipo ever endorsed my opponent I\u2019d be a little heartbroken,\u201d he tweeted the day after the endorsement. Donnelly\u2019s campaign manager, Peter Hanscom, praised Oladipo\u2019s \u201cguts\u201d for the endorsement in a tweet. But Kravitz, the Indianapolis sports columnist, said Oladipo\u2019s endorsement was unlikely to lose him many fans. \u201cIf he can get 23 points a game, 6 rebounds and two steals a game, he could throw his support behind Mussolini and we\u2019d still love him,\u201d Kravitz told me.\n\nI learned of the endorsement as I\u2019d been trying to suss out whether an eleventh-hour Braun endorsement was coming from Knight in Indiana\u2019s hotly contested Senate race. Braun\u2019s campaign announced the support of former Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz earlier in the summer, but they did not return emails seeking comment about whether a Knight endorsement was in the offing or whether it would help him in the same way that some say it helped Trump back in 2016. \u201cBob Knight is a beloved figure [for] a huge number of people in Indiana,\u201d says Rob Kendall, a Trump-supporting talk radio host in Indianapolis. \u201cSo many, including blue-collar voters that Braun desperately needs, grew up loving Indiana basketball and Bob Knight.\u201d\n\nI asked Donnelly\u2019s campaign spokesman, Will Baskin-Gerwitz, before the rally in Hammond with Biden: Would Donnelly, who\u2019s trying win over Trump voters here, accept a Knight endorsement?\n\nForty-eight hours before the surprise Oladipo endorsement, the response came.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019re more of an Oladipo kind of campaign,\u201d Baskin-Gerwitz replied.\n\nAdam Wren is a contributing editor at Politico Magazine and Indianapolis Monthly.", "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration intends to keep pressing ahead with sanctions and other efforts to starve the Iranian regime of access to global funds. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Foreign Policy 'Sanctions are coming': Trump warns Iran with 'Game of Thrones' meme Cabinet officials acknowledged that at least eight 'jurisdictions' will be given waivers \u2014 for now.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is using a \"Game of Thrones\" meme to boast to Iran's leaders that they are about to feel even more economic pain.\n\n\"Sanctions are coming, November 5,\" the president warned in a tweet Friday.

He emphasized that the deals would be temporary and said the Trump administration had demanded \u201cmuch more serious concessions\u201d than had been extracted by the Obama administration for such exemptions.\n\nThe Trump administration did not name the exempted jurisdictions, but they are expected to include China, India and Turkey. The European Union is not among the exempted jurisdictions, Pompeo said.\n\nThe secretary of State noted that the pressure campaign has already badly hit Iran\u2019s critical oil sector.\n\n\u201cWe will, we expect, have reduced Iranian crude oil exports by more than 1 million barrels even before these sanctions go into effect,\u201d Pompeo said, crediting the administration\u2019s efforts to force other countries to cut off commercial ties to Tehran.\n\nThe goal is \u201cdepriving the regime of the revenues it uses to spread death and destruction around the world,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nAside from Iran\u2019s oil sector, the latest sanctions that lock in Monday target its shipping, shipbuilding and banking sectors.\n\nIn a statement released by the White House later Friday, Trump said: \"On Monday, November 5, the termination of United States participation in the Iran nuclear deal will be complete. The last set of sanctions lifted under the terrible nuclear deal will come back into force, including powerful sanctions on Iran\u2019s energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors, and sanctions targeting transactions with the Central Bank of Iran and sanctioned Iranian banks.\n\n\"Our objective is to force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster.\"\n\nFor its part, HBO was displeased with Trump's attempt to co-opt the \"Game of Thrones\" symbolism.\n\n\"We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes,\" the network told NBC News.\n\nThe Trump team is in large part reimposing sanctions that had been lifted under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which was struck under President Barack Obama. Trump quit the nuclear deal earlier this year, saying he wants to negotiate a better agreement that covers Iran\u2019s nuclear program but also tackles its other nefarious activities, including its support for terrorist groups.\n\nTrump aides have gone beyond the U.S. sanctions originally imposed by Obama to drag Iran to the negotiating table.\n\nMnuchin said the list of sanctioned entities will be published Monday and will cover more than 700 entities, including over 300 new designations. Under both administrations, many of the sanctions not only apply to Iranian individuals and entities, but also to individuals and entities in other countries that do business with Iran.\n\nMnuchin also said SWIFT, the bank messaging system that helps transmit billions of dollars around the world every day, would be treated the same as any other entity, noting it would be subject to sanctions if it provides financial services to designated entities.\n\nThere\u2019s an exception for humanitarian actions, Mnuchin said, but \u201cbanks must be very careful that these are not disguised transactions.\"\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are unhappy with the administration\u2019s approach to SWIFT, saying there are too many loopholes.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s overall approach to Iran has also upset European allies, some of which helped negotiate the nuclear deal.

Pritzker\u2019s closing ad in Illinois governor\u2019s race? His name\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 After pouring a record-breaking $161.5 million into his own candidacy, Illinois Democrat J.B. Pritzker will close out his 18-month gubernatorial campaign with an ad that never even mentions his name.\n\nIn the final spot, first obtained by POLITICO, Pritzker doesn\u2019t ask Illinois voters to go to the polls for him specifically. Instead, the ad urges \u201con Tuesday, vote Democratic.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cYou can send a message that it\u2019s time for a change, in Springfield and in Washington,\u201d the ad says, before closing with photos of incumbent Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and President Donald Trump side by side.\n\nIn a statement about the ad, Pritzker said he\u2019s focusing on boosting Democrats up and down the ticket. Pritzker has already financed a massive statewide GOTV operation that is coordinating with Democrats across the state. While polls have consistently shown Pritzker holding a comfortable lead against Rauner, four Republican-held Illinois congressional districts remain toss-ups. The Democratic nominee for governor has also invested in the contest for attorney general, which pits Democrat Kwame Raoul against Republican Erika Harold.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Viewers will likely recognize the narrator\u2019s voice: it\u2019s Pritzker himself. He also makes an appearance in the spot.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest reminder of the largesse behind a campaign that saw the billionaire Democrat give his own campaign $161.5 million \u2014 more money than any other self-financed candidate in U.S. history. That topped the $144 million eBay executive Meg Whitman gave her own campaign in her failed 2010 bid for California governor. Rauner, a multi-millionaire himself, had set a marker by plowing $50 million into his reelection fund two years before the election with billionaire donor Ken Griffin adding another $20 million. While that may have staved off some competitors, it only brought an eminently wealthier challenger in Pritzker.\n\nAll told, fundraising in the Illinois gubernatorial contest, including self-donations, primary spending and independent expenditures, reached an eye-popping $285 million, according to the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. It\u2019s a staggering sum considering the Illinois governor\u2019s mansion was long predicted to flip to a Democrat this year in what is already a blue state. An analysis by the Associated Press reported Illinois as the most expensive governor\u2019s race in the nation \u2014 outspending Florida\u2019s bruising gubernatorial contest \u2014 and the state has also outpaced every other in reported contributions for state-level campaigns.\n\n", "Facebook and other social media giants have faced tough criticism from Capitol Hill and others over their attempts to tackle foreign influence campaigns, but DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended their efforts. | AP Photo/Gregory Bull Elections DHS secretary on midterms: 'Most secure election we\u2019ve ever had'\n\nThe 2018 cycle is \"going to be the most secure election we've ever had,\" DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said today, just days before the midterms, but she is worried about a \"dynamic threat\" that could include foreign attempts to portray the results as invalid afterward.\n\nNielsen said DHS has had no indication of a \"sustained effort to hack voting infrastructure\" from any foreign government.

This was a stunning assertion of constitutional power by California, and it was properly and promptly dismissed by the district judge. It is unfortunate that, in the interim, California forced both the Justice Department and the court to spend valuable time and resources to dispose of its baseless position.\"\n\nAt the time of the filing, Justice Department officials panned the law as yet another way to counter the Trump administration. Sessions noted that \u201cCalifornia was admitted to the Union upon the express condition that it would never interfere with the disposal of federal land\u201d and complained that he shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cspend valuable time and resources\u201d on the suit.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has, once again, passed an extreme statute found in no other state to obstruct the federal government, this time by interfering with the conveyance of federal lands,\u201d acting Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio said at the time. \u201cThis is another example of California ignoring federal law.

Republicans\u2019 cut in the corporate tax rate has given Democrats a fat target this campaign season, which they\u2019ve used to cast the entire Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a massive corporate giveaway. Polls show the public basically agrees, with one survey last month showing voters believe large corporations are the biggest winners under the law. But, as yours truly writes, Republicans actually paid for much of their cut in the corporate rate by raising other, less-noticed taxes on big companies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEven as they slashed the rate, they simultaneously raised taxes on corporations by more than $1 trillion through hikes on everything from their overseas earnings to their fringe benefits. \u201cThe reality is, on the business side, most of it was offset \u2014 but that\u2019s not something the typical person thinks,\u201d said Mark Prater, a former top GOP tax aide in the Senate. That means the corporate tax cut is not nearly so large as many seem to presume, and it is significantly less costly than the tax cuts going to individual Americans. Next year, the law\u2019s business tax cuts will cost less than half of what goes to individuals, official tables show.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible that many of those tax increases will not ultimately stick. We saw that with the Affordable Care Act, which was supposed to be deficit neutral, but not long after it passed, lawmakers began suspending tax increases intended defray its cost.\n\nIT\u2019S FRIDAY.

The New York Times looks at the potential legal battle over President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. If Democrats take the House, they\u2019re promising to use an obscure law to force the Treasury Department to hand them over. \u201cIf they win the House and there is a request, we will work with our general counsel and the IRS general counsel on any requests,\u201d Secretary Steven Mnuchin tells the paper. More interesting perhaps is former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who said he could see his old agency thinking twice about handing them over. \u201cHe suggested that the more fundamental intention of law is the protection of taxpayer privacy, so Treasury and IRS lawyers could deem a request that appears intended to publicize the president\u2019s tax information for political purposes inappropriate,\u201d the Times said.\n\nMIDTERM ROUNDUP: Rep. Tom MacArthur, the only New Jersey Republican to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is in a tough reelection bid. His vote for the new $10,000 SALT cap is unpopular, but he's portraying it as an example of his independent-mindedness, The Wall Street Journal says.\n\nTaxes in general are getting serious play in both Democratic and Republican House television campaign ads, the Wesleyan Media Project finds. It was the top issue in pro-GOP ads between Sept. 4 and Oct. 25, and the second-most popular issue in Democratic spots. And while all eyes are on the House, the Cook Political Report sees four members of the Senate Finance Committee in tight reelection races. With less than a week to go, the nonpartisan election handicapper says Democratic Sens. Bill Nelson, Claire McCaskill and Bob Menendez along with Republican Sen. Dean Heller are all in difficult fights for another term.\n\nUNHAPPY WITH OPPORTUNITY ZONE REGULATIONS: Treasury\u2019s opportunity zones rules were taxpayer friendly, but not friendly enough for some. Venture capital firms and other potential investors are unhappy with a provision in the rules that \u201crequires that businesses generate at least half their gross income from within the distressed community or 'opportunity zone' in which they operate,\u201d Bloomberg News reports. \u201cThat\u2019s fine for, say, an apartment building or a grocery store, but a disaster for a business hoping to manufacture a product to be sold widely, or provide services online.\u201d\n\nNOT SO MUCH FOR ESTATE TAX LAWYERS TO DO THESE DAYS: The Washington Post looks at how years of cuts to the estate tax have left estate tax lawyers with relatively little to do. \u201cCharles \u2018Skip\u2019 Fox, president of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel, said he frequently hears of lawyers shifting their focus away from navigating the estate tax, and adds that there has been a downturn in the number of young attorneys going into the estate tax field. Jennifer Bird-Pollan, who teaches the estate tax to law students at the University of Kentucky, said that nearly a decade ago her classes were packed with dozens of students. Now, only a handful of students every so often may be interested in the subject or pursuing it as a career.\u201d\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nEU WILLLING TO COMPROMISE ON DIGITAL TAX: \u201cEuropean Union finance ministers will discuss next week a watered down proposal on an EU-wide digital tax, a document seen by Reuters shows, trying to persuade reticent governments to agree on a plan by the end of the year,\u201d the news service reports. The revised plan, offered by Austria, would create an expiration date on the proposed levy. \u201cAustria has also proposed excluding the sale of users\u2019 data from the activities covered by the planned tax, softening the commission\u2019s proposal,\u201d Reuters said.\n\nDID YOU KNOW FINLAND MAKES TAXPAYER DATA PUBLIC? \u201cFinland is unusual, even among the Nordic states, in turning its release of personal tax data \u2014 to comply with government transparency laws \u2014 into a public ritual of comparison,\u201d the New York Times reports. \u201cThough some complain that the tradition is an invasion of privacy, most say it has helped the country resist the trend toward growing inequality that has crept across of the rest of Europe.\u201d It also leads to shaming of tax dodgers, the Times said. As for Trump\u2019s refusal to release his returns, one Finn called it \u201cunthinkable,\u201d adding: \u201cThe society just expects that to happen. If it did not happen, that society would punish that candidate.\u201d\n\nTAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT HURTING IRELAND: \u201cUS investment in Ireland declined by \u20ac45bn ($51bn) in 2017, in another sign that sweeping tax reforms introduced by US president Donald Trump have impacted the decisions of American multinational companies,\u201d Yahoo Finance reports. \u201cEconomists have been warning that both the UK\u2019s impending departure from the EU and Trump\u2019s overhaul of the US tax code, which aimed to reduce the use of foreign low-tax jurisdictions by US companies, would dent inward investment in Ireland.\u201d\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nBROWNBACK TAX EXPERIMENT STILL ECHOES: Former Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback is gone, now serving as an ambassador, but he\u2019s not forgotten in this year\u2019s gubernatorial race, the New York Times reports. \u201cState Senator Laura Kelly, the Democrat running for governor of Kansas, likes to talk about Sam Brownback, the Republican ex-governor. At a debate last week, she mentioned him five times. And that was just in her two-minute opening statement. Democrats see a path to power in red-leaning Kansas this way: Talk a lot about Mr. Brownback and his tax-slashing experiment that left gaping state revenue shortfalls in recent years. Then tie the ex-governor as closely as possible to Secretary of State Kris W.

A high-level meeting to discuss trade issues with India originally scheduled to take place Nov. 1 will probably be postponed until January at the earliest. In rural America, farmers continue to be patient with President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies even as commodity prices continue to drop. Start here:\n\nTRUMP EXPANDS HIS CHINA ATTACK STRATEGY: The Department of Justice is now a major player in the U.S. fight against Beijing\u2019s trade practices, which the administration says includes blatant theft of technology and trade secrets from U.S. companies. The first \u2014 and unlikely to be the last \u2014 target of the initiative is Chinese state-owned company Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., which Justice alleges was part of a conspiracy to steal, convey, and possess trade secrets stolen from Idaho-based Micron Technology. Taiwanese semiconductor foundry United Microelectronics Corp. and three Taiwanese nationals were also named in the indictment as being part of the scheme.\n\nThe action represents an increasingly multi-pronged approach at punishing China\u2019s alleged theft of U.S. intellectual property and policies that require U.S. companies to transfer their technology to Chinese partner companies as a condition for doing business there. Tariffs have already hit more than $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. On Monday, Jinhua was sanctioned by the Commerce Department.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going after a number of Chinese companies going forward. This is just the beginning,\u201d a source close to the effort told Morning Trade.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled a new initiative on Thursday that will target Chinese economic espionage. One of the goals of the new \u201cChina Initiative\u201d is to address supply chain threats to the telecommunications sector as it transitions to 5G networks \u2014 a technology that China is racing to dominate.

The U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum had been expected on Nov. 1 in New Delhi. But the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative never confirmed the date and three weeks ago industry officials had serious doubts the meeting would occur.\n\nUSTR declined to comment on Thursday about the status of the meeting, which was last held in October 2017, when little was accomplished. Instead of the customary joint statement issued at the end of the forum, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer issued his own press release that said the two sides had \u201cdiffering views that could not be resolved immediately [and] there was agreement that it is critical to continue strong engagement over the coming months in order to achieve concrete outcomes before the next TPF.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a number of news outlets in India reported earlier this week that Trump declined Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s invitation to be a guest at India\u2019s annual Republic Day celebration on Jan. 26. A White House spokesperson told the publications that Trump could not attend the event because of \u201cscheduling conflicts\u201d but \u201cvery much looks forward to meeting PM Modi again at the earliest opportunity.\u201d\n\nDISPATCH FROM THE HEARTLAND: FARMERS\u2019 LOVE FOR TRUMP STAYS STRONG: Ask a farmer in southern Illinois what the impact of Trump's trade war has been on his or her bottom line, and you'll probably get a pretty specific answer. It might be a 20 percent cut in profits due to falling commodity prices, for example, or higher costs for a new combine or grain bin, whose prices are rising because of tariffs on steel.\n\nBut ask them if they're planning to vote Republican on Election Day next week, and you'll almost certainly get an answer in the affirmative. Farmers in Illinois' sprawling 12th Congressional District, where Megan spent a few days last week, are unwavering in their support for the GOP, even as their policies are directly cutting into their own profits and affecting their livelihoods.\n\nRoadblock to a blue wave? Democrats had pinpointed the district as one of their most likely opportunities to pick up a House seat, as they sought to win back the Obama-Trump voter and launch a blue wave that hinged, in part, on the expectation that farmers would abandon the GOP as trade woes hit the Midwest. But incumbent Republican Rep. Mike Bost is pulling away in polls, offering a glimpse of how that economic argument might not be enough to win over voters, even in swing districts.\n\nFarmers' reasons for sticking with Trump are multi-fold: They almost uniformly told Megan that they believed in Trump's mission, and that they feel short-term pain is worth better access to markets in the long run. Many also support the tariffs to protect U.S. national security and pointed to the launch of new negotiations with the U.K., EU and Japan as proof that the president is making progress. Read Megan's full story here.\n\nFlip side of the same coin: steel: There's more than just ag in IL-12. The district is also home to a U.S. Steel plant in Granite City, which has also put several hundred workers back on the job since Trump put steel and aluminum tariffs in place in the spring. The United Steelworkers union has endorsed Brendan Kelly, the Democrat in the race, but many individual steelworkers say they are sticking with Bost, who they credit for giving them back their jobs.\n\nThe dueling storylines within the district represent a microcosm of sorts illustrating the two sides of Trump\u2019s trade war \u2014 and show how on both sides, loyalty to the GOP throughout middle America remains strong.\n\nCHINESE TARIFF EXCLUSION REQUESTS CONTINUE TO RISE: The opportunity to file requests for products to be excluded from Trump\u2019s 25 percent tariff on an initial $34 billion worth of Chinese goods ended on Oct. 9. But the number of requests posted to a spreadsheet maintained by USTR continues to rise. The latest tally, as of Nov. 1, shows more than 7,800 requests. So far, more than 800 have been denied and none have been approved, but around 240 are tagged for approval if U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the exclusions are administrable.\n\nA second spreadsheet shows companies have filed 435 requests to be excluded from 25 percent duties on an additional $16 billion worth of Chinese goods. That number is also certain to rise because companies have until Dec. 18 to file requests. Most of the requests so far are still in Stage 1 of the review process, where another company can object to the exclusion request. However, some are in Stage 2, where USTR makes a determination whether to deny a request or mark it for tentative approval, subject to CBP\u2019s final OK.\n\nUSTR has not established an exclusion process for the $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that Trump hit with a 10 percent tariff that is scheduled to rise to 25 percent on Jan. 1\n\nBOUSTANY TO JOIN ANTI-TARIFF CAMPAIGN: Former Republican Rep. Charles Boustany will become the public face of a campaign fighting the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. Boustany, a Louisiana lawmaker who was a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and vociferous proponent of free trade during his 12 years in Congress, will be the spokesman for the Tariffs Hurt the Heartland campaign. The grassroots effort will hold town-hall style events in Washington state, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, Louisiana and Missouri starting after the election and into the new year. The campaign has also funded ads in 11 states.\n\n\u201cYou learn quickly in Congress that real change begins outside the Beltway, with the people whose lives are being impacted,\u201d Boustany said in a statement.\n\n\u2018TROIKA OF TYRANNY\u2019: CUBA TO GET HIT WITH MORE TRADE RESTRICTIONS: National Security Adviser John Bolton said the administration will add more than two dozen new entities to the Cuba restricted list. He announced the move during a speech in Miami on Thursday in which he listed Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua as members of the \u201cTroika of Tyranny\u201d among Latin American nations. Bolton provided no detail on which entities would be added to the list.\n\nThe additions to the restricted list would come almost a year after the initial list was published. The Trump administration action represented a reversal on some of the Obama administration\u2019s policies that opened up Cuba and allowed U.S. companies more freedom to make certain investments and lifted some travel restrictions. Trump last year rolled back some of those travel policies and barred U.S. companies or people from engaging in transactions with GAESA, the business arm of the Cuban military that controls most of the hotels on the island.\n\nProponents of a more open Cuba trade policy criticized the addition of more entities to the list: \u201cExpanding this list is another slap in the face to Cuban entrepreneurs, whose restaurants, Airbnbs, and other services have suffered over the past year as American travel and investor confidence have both declined,\u201d James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, said in a statement.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 When looking at the multidimensional U.S.-India trade relationship, Trump appears to have his eye on only one trade irritant: tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, The New York Times reports.\n\n\u2014 Trump\u2019s trade war is shifting the flow of agricultural products in the U.S., which in turn is changing pricing patterns, Bloomberg reports.\n\n\u2014 China signals a big shift in its economic policy as it faces headwinds from the trade fight with the U.S., the South China Morning Post reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

While doctors applauded the effort to reduce their administrative burden, many warned it would slash their payment for treating complex patients \u2014 so the version released Thursday preserves the billing code for the most complex patients and collapses the coding system into three tiers starting in 2021. Pros can read that story here.\n\n...elsewhere in the Thursday evening news dump, CMS finalized most of its proposed changes to the health IT sections of the MIPS program, Morning eHealth\u2019s Darius Tahir reports.\n\nThe changes are intended to streamline documentation and reporting requirements for clinicians that grew out of the meaningful use program. Under the scoring system, physicians must demonstrate their commitment to information sharing by submitting data to entities like public health agencies and other doctors.

PCORI \u2014 the $6 billion comparative effectiveness group that\u2019s up for reauthorization next year \u2014 got a shot in the arm from a former GOP Doctor Caucus member.\n\nLobbyist Phil Gingrey, the former Georgia congressman, said he\u2019d be joining Tony Coelho, the former Democratic congressman from California, to push for new funds for PCORI. Since becoming a lobbyist for the District Policy Group after leaving office in 2015, Gingrey has softened his stance on parts of Obamacare, which funded 10 years of research through the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.\n\nBack in 2010, Gingrey said PCORI could end up functioning like European agencies that weigh whether government health agencies should pay for different drugs or procedures. But PCORI was sited outside of HHS and its charter expressly does not address health care costs, only efficacy.\n\n\u201cI hated the ACA and I hated PCORI, but I have to say I\u2019m very comfortable today that PCORI has fulfilled and continues to fulfill its mission,\u201d said Gingrey, a former ob-gyn, in a panel with Coelho. PCORI spokeswoman Christine Stencel said Gingrey, who lobbies for various provider and research groups, had no direct relationship with the institute.\n\nREPORT \u2014 VA EHR UPGRADE \u201cTRENDING TOWARDS RED\u201d: A recent progress report from Cerner on its VA EHR modernization project called its alert level \u201cyellow trending towards red,\u201d ProPublica\u2019s Isaac Arnsdorf, formerly at POLITICO, reports. That\u2019s not a good sign for the $10 billion project, recently under scrutiny from lawmakers for a variety of reasons, not least because of the influence of three individuals associated with President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort. Arnsdorf reports that the White House and Trump\u2019s associates have interfered with the hiring of a qualified leader for the tech upgrade, and that current leaders have no health care experience.\n\nCYBERSECURITY\n\nOIG CONTINUES FOCUS ON FDA\u2019S CYBER WORK: FDA\u2019s monitoring of devices for cybersecurity problems was lacking, a new report by HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General argues. The report, based on fieldwork conducted between September 2016 and February 2017, states that the agency needs to do a better job ensuring devices already on the market are well-defended against digital intrusion.\n\nMuch of the report\u2019s criticisms are based on historical information, and the agency claims it\u2019s addressed many of the faults. FDA recently embarked on a spate of cybersecurity activity, including issuing new guidance and inking a memorandum of understanding with DHS and other cyber organizations.\n\nA September OIG report urged FDA to do more to check devices\u2019 digital defenses during the pre-market phase.\n\nWYDEN DRAFT BILL COULD SEND TECH EXECS TO PRISON: Draft legislation from Sen. Ron Wyden would beef up the Federal Trade Commission's power to police tech companies' privacy practices \u2014 and subject senior executives to criminal penalties for breaking the rules, our colleague Ashley Gold reports.\n\nWyden's Consumer Data Protection Act of 2018 applies to companies with at least a million users that generate at least $50 million in annual revenue. It would create a national Do Not Track registry to let Americans stop tech companies from collecting and sharing their data. Under the draft bill, the FTC would maintain a website for that registry where people could view or change their opt-out status.\n\nWyden also proposes letting sites like Facebook and Google offer paid versions of their services that don't collect data, as long as they don't charge more than they would have made from data-driven targeted advertising.\n\nThe measure would direct the FTC to establish cybersecurity and privacy standards for tech companies to follow. Companies would then have to submit an annual report on their compliance with the act and ensuing FTC rules. Misleading the agency on that report could send top executives to prison for up to 20 years.\n\nNIH RE-OPENS GENOMIC SUMMARY DATA: NIH on Thursday announced that it would again allow unrestricted research access to genomic summary results for most NIH-funded research. The summary results do not include individual-level information, Human Genome Research Institute Director Eric Green said in a blog post.\n\nThey come from analyzing pooled genomic data to generate a statistical result for the entire dataset, providing potentially powerful tools to help figure out which genomic variants contribute to diseases.\n\n\u2026 NIH had removed the summary results from unrestricted access after researchers raised concerns in 2008 that general access could lead to privacy violations.

Economists expect to see an uptick in job growth this morning when the Labor Department releases the October jobs numbers. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the creation of 190,000 jobs \u2014 up from September\u2019s 134,000. They also expect a modest 3 percent increase in over-the-year hourly earnings and the unemployment rate to match last month\u2019s at 3.7 percent. Payroll company ADP was more optimistic, calculating 227,000 private-sector jobs added in October, just shy of its independent calculation for September at 230,000 jobs.\n\nThe current rate of job growth \"is not sustainable,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, warned earlier this week, predicting it will slow in the coming months. \"Even if businesses want to hire workers, they're not going to be able to find them,\" he said. \"At some point it\u2019s going to bite into the job numbers, it's inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am surprised we sustained this rate of job growth at this point,\" he added.\n\nRelated read: \u201c5 Things to Watch in the October Jobs Report,\u201d from The Wall Street Journal\n\nIT\u2019S FRIDAY!

POLITICO\u2019s Ted Hesson, Rebecca Morin and Andrew Restuccia report that Trump said the U.S. military would treat any rocks thrown by asylum-seeking migrants heading to the southern border as firearms.\n\n\"They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\" Trump said from the White House podium Thursday. \"We'll consider \u2014 and I told them \u2014 consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle.\"\n\nThe president this week ordered 5,200 troops to the border, and told reporters Wednesday that he might increase that number to 15,000, the trio report. \u201cThe troops will not conduct law enforcement operations, but some of them will be armed for self-defense, administration officials said Monday.\u201d Before the announcement to potentially increase the number of troops, a Mexican official told Morning Shift: \u201cWe\u2019re always worried when foreign troops come to our border. Imagine it the other way around?\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is weighing a series of policy options to limit asylum-seekers' ability to enter the U.S. The president said a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration executive order is coming \u201csometime next week\u201d during his speech Thursday, although he provided little detail of what it will include. More from POLITICO here.\n\nGOOGLE WALKOUT: At 11:10 a.m. in every time zone, employees at over 60 percent of Google offices across the world flooded the streets Thursday demanding \u201can end to the sexual harassment, discrimination, and the systemic racism\u201d that organizers say fuels a \u201cdestructive culture\u201d at the company. \u201cThis is a new era in tech,\u201d one organizer told Morning Shift. \u201cThere's a lot of questions we need to ask about how this culture is built.\u201d\n\nEmployee organizers penned a piece in The Cut Thursday, outlining their demands to address the culture at the tech-giant. The list includes: an end to forced arbitration in cases of harassment and discrimination; a commitment to end pay and opportunity inequity; a publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report; and a clear, uniform, globally inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d one of the walkout organizers said. \u201cWhat we saw here is people flexing their muscle and saying, \u2018Hey we do have power.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe walkout was spurred from a New York Times report that Google paid out $90 million to Andy Rubin, creator of Android software, even after determining that reports he coerced a female employee into performing oral sex were credible. \u201cThis is not blowing off steam, this is going to escalate if our demands aren\u2019t met,\u201d the organizer added.

However, a federal judge early last month temporarily halted the Trump administration\u2019s plan to force more than 300,000 nationals from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan to find another immigration status or face deportation. TPS allows people to remain in the U.S. and apply for work permits if their home country experiences a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. The October preliminary injunction prevents the administration from ending TPS until the courts have issued a final ruling in Ramos v. Nielsen. More on that from POLITICO\u2019s Ted Hesson here.\n\nTIME OUT: The Women\u2019s National Basketball Players Association announced Thursday that it will terminate its current collective bargaining agreement with the WNBA Oct. 31, 2019.

This is about a six-foot-nine superstar taking a red-eye cross-country and having to sit in an economy seat instead of an exit row. Often with delays,\u201d Nneka Ogwumike, of the Los Angeles Sparks and president of the WNBPA, said in a piece in The Players\u2019 Tribune.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at issues like that \u2014 those everyday, real-life player experiences.

Here\u2019s the immigration and employment issues we\u2019re watching:\n\nVaping at work: In Florida, voters will consider a revision to the state constitution that would ban the use of vaping, including electronic cigarettes, in enclosed indoor workplaces (the vaping item is bundled with a ban on offshore oil drilling in state waters). The change must be approved by 60 percent of voters to become law.\n\nMinimum wage increases: In both Arkansas and Missouri, voters will decide whether to raise their state's minimum wage. In Arkansas, voters will consider Issue 5, an initiative that would gradually increase the minimum wage to $11 per hour (up from $8.50) by 2021. Missouri\u2019s proposition B would gradually increase the state\u2019s minimum to $12 an hour by 2023 (up from $7.85) and after that would adjust based on the consumer price index. Government employers are exempt from wage minimum.\n\nPensions: In Arizona, Proposition 125 would grant the legislature permission to make changes to shore up two of the state\u2019s pension plans for correctional officers and elected officials. The legislature\u2019s proposals would replace the \u201ccurrent permanent benefit increase with a cost of living adjustment tied to inflation and transition to a defined contribution system\u201d for corrections officers hired on or after July 1, 2018. Elected official retirees would be \u201cguaranteed cost of living adjustment tied to inflation.\u201d\n\nRest breaks: California voters will decide whether to allow private ambulance drivers to remain on-call during rest breaks while being paid at their normal rate, so that they can more promptly to respond to emergencies. Proposition 11 would allow private ambulance employees to be exempt from California labor laws requiring hourly employees to take certain rest and meal breaks without being on call.\n\nJail work requirements: In Colorado, residents will vote on whether to approve Amendment A, which would remove a provision in the state constitution that permits \u201cinvoluntary servitude\u201d for criminals.\n\nSanctuary states: Oregon voters will consider Measure 105, which would repeal the state\u2019s sanctuary law limiting state cooperation in enforcing federal immigration laws.\n\nPayroll tax: Maine\u2019s Question 1 measure would create a 3.8 percent payroll tax to fund a Universal Home Care Program for people with disabilities and senior citizens.\n\nLIFE AFTER JANUS\n\nTEACHERS UNION DODGES JANUS: Teachers unions appear to have dodged a serious blow to their political activity and membership rolls following the sweeping Supreme Court ruling in Janus v. AFSCME earlier this year, POLITICO\u2019s Caitlin Emma and Mel Leonor report.\n\n\u201cNine union leaders in eight states interviewed by POLITICO reported modest but anticipated drops in membership since the court decision, in addition to the loss of thousands of non-members who used to pay mandatory union fees,\u201d they write. On top of that, union leaders reported an uptick in members participating in midterm canvassing and phone banking. Although the teachers unions\u2019 national rankings in political giving to candidates has slipped, even conservatives acknowledged that teachers remained key to Democratic Party election organizing, Emma and Leonor write.

Fatima Goss Graves, who leads the National Women\u2019s Law Center, plans to tell the commission that the department under DeVos has \u201call but abandoned many of its civil rights enforcement duties.\u201d She\u2019ll blast the agency for rescinding Obama-era guidelines for schools handling allegations of sexual assault, scrapping guidance on the use of race in admissions and rewriting the manual for its civil rights investigators. Read her statement here.\n\n\u2014 The commission will hear about school discipline and diversity from Janel George, a senior policy advisor who co-leads the Equitable Resources and Access team at the Learning Policy Institute. George will present two reports \u2014 one on discipline, the other on diversity in schools \u2014 that say \u201cat minimum, this administration could stall progress toward achieving educational equity and may, in fact, reverse progress.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Advocates will slam the administration on affirmative action and bash its record on protections for students with disabilities. John Yang, the president of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, will blast the administration for backing a court fight over Harvard\u2019s use of race in admissions, saying \u201clitigation to remove consideration of race in college admissions should not be a priority for the Justice Department.\u201d Read his statement here. Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, plans to say, \u201cThough it is not uncommon for new Administrations to review policies, regulations and guidance from previous Administrations, the current Administration\u2019s actions have taken this to an extreme level.\u201d Read his statement here.\n\n\u2014 Some speakers will defend the Trump administration. Robert Driscoll, who served as deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ\u2019s Civil Rights Division under George W. Bush, plans to tell the commission that \u201cconservatives, including conservative civil rights lawyers, tend to feel bound by statutory and constitutional text. As such, advocacy groups and others that want, in the absence of statutory authority, to advance issues such as transgender rights, are disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cFederal civil rights enforcers do not write with a free hand,\u201d Driscoll plans to say. \u201cI recall, back in the early 2000s, I was responding to congressional inquiries about whether the civil rights division would respond to the cases of violence against gay students in public schools under a strained interpretation of Title IX. I responded that the Division would happily bring such cases if Congress would give us the authority to do so, but in the absence of such authority I could not.\u201d He notes that DOJ now prosecutes such hate crimes based on sexual orientation after the passage of a 2009 hate crimes law explicitly covering such crimes. Read his full statement.\n\n\u2014 Others will argue what we\u2019re seeing now is a bit of deja vu. R. Shep Melnick, a political science professor at Boston College, will echo Driscoll. He plans to say that \u201cmuch of the often heated and often partisan debate over \u2018enforcement\u2019 of civil rights laws is not really about enforcement at all. For decades Democrats have accused Republican Administrations of failing to enforce civil rights laws; Republicans have accused Democratic Administrations of regulatory overreach and administrative bullying. In reality, these are debates about what our policies should be \u2014 the proper regulatory standards \u2014 not the extent to which established policies are being adequately enforced.\u201d Read his statement here.\n\n\u2014 The civil rights commission is chaired by Catherine Lhamon, who led the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights under the Obama administration. Other Obama administration alums are expected to testify, as well, including Arne Duncan, the former Education secretary. He is expected to criticize the Trump administration\u2019s \u201csteps to starve civil rights enforcement that could, if unchecked, last well after the end of the current presidency.\u201d That includes repeated attempts to cut OCR\u2019s budget and its \u201crepeatedly expressed position that the federal government should leave decisions \u2014 even decisions about civil rights \u2014 to state and local choices.\u201d Read his written statement.\n\n\u2014 The commission will also hear about civil rights enforcement at other agencies, including HHS, HUD and the Labor Department. It will issue findings, recommendations and a report next September, incorporating testimony from today\u2019s hearing as part of the investigation. The hearing kicks off a 9 a.m. at the National Place Building, 1331 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, 11th Floor, Suite 1150. Watch the livestream.\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

Judge Allison Burroughs offered both sides an opportunity to make another round of arguments at a later date and both appear ready to take her up on it. That hearing isn\u2019t set, but will likely take place early next year. Expect both sides to keep arguing their cases in court filings before then, as well.\n\n\n\nMIDTERMS WATCH\n\nKEEP AN EYE ON THESE HILL STAFFERS: If Democrats take the House, as many insiders predict, Rep. Bobby Scott, (D-Va.), the ranking member on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, is expected to become chairman. Democrats likely would ramp up oversight of the department. Here are two staffers who have been on the committee\u2019s minority staff who could play a more prominent role:\n\n\u2014 Jacque Mosely, the education policy director, is a veteran education policy wonk who has worked for both Scott and former Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) when he was the committee\u2019s ranking member. She worked closely with Scott behind the scenes as he helped negotiate the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015 that updated the George W. Bush-era\u2019s No Child Left Behind.\n\n\u2014 V\u00e9ronique Pluviose, the staff director, has a civil rights background, having joined the staff as civil rights counsel in 2015. She started her Hill career working for Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), and did a previous stint working for the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nTITLE IX\n\nLATEST ON TITLE IX: DeVos\u2019 proposed rules for schools handling allegations of sexual harassment and assault are expected to come out this month \u2014 but not until after the midterms, despite some speculation that the proposed regulations could be released sooner. OMB was still reviewing the proposal late Thursday and was still holding meetings on it as recently as Tuesday.\n\n\u2014 The administration is expected to make a couple of tweaks to the proposal compared with drafts that leaked this summer. One change, which is likely to be controversial, would allow students to cross-examine their accusers. The cross-examination wouldn\u2019t necessarily be direct, though. Questions could go through a third party and students could be in separate rooms during questioning. Under another change, the rules are expected to maintain the right for both parties to appeal rulings, rather than just accused students, as an earlier draft indicated. Both changes were first reported by The Wall Street Journal and were confirmed by POLITICO.\n\n\u2014 The proposal is also not expected to contain language narrowly defining gender under federal law. The New York Times reported last month that HHS has for months been considering defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth under Title IX \u2014 federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in federally funded education programs. If approved by the Justice Department, other agencies would have to adhere to the definition, which would essentially erase federal recognition of and protections for transgender individuals.\n\n\u2014 The leaders of Princeton, Rutgers and the University of Wisconsin, meanwhile, are urging DeVos to \"do everything you can to prevent\" that proposal from becoming a reality. \"We hope you will provide needed leadership in opposing the proposed change, and that you will strongly advocate for an interpretation of Title IX (and other federal laws) that fully protects the rights of transgender people \u2014 an interpretation grounded in the law, medical judgment, compassion, and a firm commitment to respect the dignity of all Americans,\" the university leaders wrote in a letter to DeVos Thursday.\n\n\u2014 The letter came as a slew of major corporations \u2014 including Amazon, Coca Cola and Nike \u2014 signed a statement opposing \"any administrative and legislative efforts to erase transgender protections through reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations.\"\n\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS\n\n\u2014 The Data Quality Campaign, a nonprofit, has added three new members to its board of directors: Jos\u00e9 Luis Cruz, president of the Herbert H. Lehman College of The City University of New York; Cassandra Herring, founder and CEO of the Branch Alliance for Educator Diversity; and Stephen Pruitt, president of the Southern Regional Education Board and former Kentucky state commissioner of education.\n\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n\n\u2014 A new survey conducted by the advocacy group Student Debt Crisis found nearly 9 in 10 student loan borrowers are struggling to make their payments.\n\n\u2014 While half of adjunct faculty would prefer to have a tenure-track position, two-thirds report being satisfied overall with their academic careers, according to a new survey by TIAA Institute.\n\nSYLLABUS\n\n\u2014 CFPB employee union files mass grievance complaint: POLITICO Pro.\n\n\u2014 Maryland Board of Regents chair plans to step down amid fallout from death of football player: The Washington Post.\n\n\u2014 Maryland\u2019s accreditation is also now under review after the player\u2019s death: The Baltimore Sun.\n\n\u2014 The overwhelming majority of DeVos\u2019 scheduled conversations in her first year-and-a-half in office were with Republicans: EdWeek.\n\n\u2014 North Carolina\u2019s state school board delays vote on school takeover: AP.\n\nIt\u2019s not living if it\u2019s not with the Pro Education team. @caitlinzemma (cemma@politico.com), @khefling (khefling@politico.com), @mstratford (mstratford@politico.com), @BenjaminEW (bwermund@politico.com), @MelLeonor_ (mleonor@politico.com) and @JaneNorman (jnorman@politico.com).", "Ag's biggest 2018 ballot initiative\n\nWith help from Sarah Zimmerman, Helena Bottemiller Evich and Ryan McCrimmon\n\nEditor's Note: This edition of Free Morning Agriculture is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Agriculture subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIN THE HOPPER: California voters next week will decide on a ballot initiative that could affect decisions by egg, pork and veal producers in other states.\n\n\u2014 Farmers\u2019 bottom lines are getting whacked by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. But that doesn\u2019t mean ag will abandon the president that farmers helped put in the White House.\n\n\u2014 Target: Romaine lettuce.

But what really makes it one of the most consequential state ballot initiatives in this election cycle is that it would require producers in other states to move to cage-free if they intend to sell within the country\u2019s most populous state.\n\n\u2014 The pork and egg industries warn it will have far-reaching implications for producers nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe pressure to meet this market demand will impact production in many states,\u201d said Ken Klippen, a spokesman for the National Association of Egg Farmers, which opposes the initiative.\n\n\u2014 Sound familiar? California voters passed a similar initiative, Proposition 2, in 2008. It forced producers of pigs, eggs and veal to house animals in spaces that don\u2019t inordinately constrain movement. But animal activists said that measure didn\u2019t go far enough in terms of enforcement and allowed producers to continue using cages. Prop 12 closes those loopholes, which proponents say will promote animal welfare and keep food safer.\n\n\u2014 The food safety debate: Both sides of the debate argue that their preferred approach to housing is a better option to combat the spread of disease \u2014 highlighting how there is no scientific consensus on the link between food safety and livestock housing.\n\nPros, POLITICO\u2019s Sarah Zimmerman has the full story here.\n\nHAPPY FRIDAY, NOV. 2!

It went for former President Barack Obama in 2012, and Democratic strategists figured that Trump\u2019s trade war would push Republican-voting farmers away from the GOP as retaliatory tariffs cut into their bottom lines and crop prices plummeted.\n\n\u2014 But that bet may be wrong. Republican incumbent Mike Bost has pulled in front of his Democratic challenger Brendan Kelly in recent weeks after they ran neck-and-neck for months.\n\n\u2014 His surge has made the race a showcase for why the tariff argument alone may not be enough for Democrats to prevail in farm country races, Pro Trade\u2019s Megan Cassella reports in a dispatch from the campaign trail in Illinois.\n\nJudgment day for Schumer: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has spent two years trying to protect a group of red-state Democrats from being unseated.

The FDA said Thursday it\u2019s launching a special surveillance project to monitor romaine lettuce for contamination.\n\n\u201cThis will help us determine whether products are safe to enter the U.S. marketplace,\u201d FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.\n\n\u2014 It was probably the water: FDA conducted an intensive, monthslong investigation after the outbreak in Yuma-produced romaine, but could not nail down the definitive cause. In an environmental assessment released Thursday, FDA said contaminated canal water was likely the mode of contamination, but investigators couldn\u2019t rule out other possibilities.\n\nFDA found the outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 in sampling of water from three locations along a 3.5-mile stretch of an irrigation canal adjacent to both lettuce growing fields and a CAFO.\n\n\u2014 Where are the produce safety water standards? The fact that FDA identified water as the likely means of contamination led consumer groups to call on the agency to finalize its long-delayed water-safety standards under the Food Safety Modernization Act produce-safety rule.\n\n\u2014 Slow regulatory roll: Last year, FDA essentially scrapped its water standards after produce growers, local food advocates and others connected to the sector criticized the regulations as being too complicated and unworkable for growers. Compliance with water standards for produce growers has been pushed back several years to give FDA more time to develop new, more workable standards.\n\n\u201cIn light of this assessment, FDA must finalize its safety standards for agricultural water soon \u2014 in a matter of months, not years,\u201d Sandra Eskin, head of food safety at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said in an email to MA. Eskin suggested FDA should develop stronger standards than it previously proposed.\n\n\u2018PROFESSOR\u2019 PERDUE TOUTS ERS, NIFA MOVES: Perdue talked up his plans to relocate the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture during a lecture Thursday at Kansas State University. The school is one of the sites that formally expressed interest in housing the two agencies.\n\n\u2014 \u201cYour folks here in Kansas have been encouraging to me,\u201d Perdue told students, in between life lessons and farm tales. (Here\u2019s the speech.)\n\nK-State is part of an economic development coalition seeking to bring ERS and NIFA to Manhattan. The school\u2019s Polytechnic Campus, in Salina, has expressed interest separately.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWe\u2019ve got great researchers at USDA, as you do here at Kansas State,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cI believe their research will be even more effective if the team is closer to the constituents and the farmers that they serve.\u201d\n\nAmazon on the mind: Perdue name-dropped the tech mega-company multiple times, along with Chick-fil-A, calling them models of efficiency and customer service. \u201cI want USDA to be the Amazon of federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nROW CROPS\n\n\u2014 States up next in dicamba decisions: Now that EPA has signed off on two more years of dicamba use, Bayer has turned its attention to 34 states that will issue their own reauthorizations and/or restrictions of the widely used herbicide.

Pro Energy\u2019s Zack Colman has details on a letter that the heads of the three entities sent to lawmakers Thursday.\n\n\u2014 Trump expresses optimism about China trade talks: After a call Thursday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump said trade discussions are \u201cmoving along nicely.\u201d The two leaders are set to meet at the end of the month in Buenos Aires, in what is shaping up to be an important juncture in the trade war. Pro Trade\u2019s Adam Behsudi has the recap.\n\n\u2014 Ag merger bills draw support: More than 200 organizations are backing a pair of measures introduced by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) that would pause mergers within the agriculture industry for 18 months, giving lawmakers time to update antitrust laws to better address industry consolidation. Massive tie-ups have caused declining farm prices and incomes, stagnant wages and increasing food prices, their letter claims.\n\n\u2014 Boustany joins anti-tariffs effort: Charles Boustany, a former Louisiana Republican congressman, is now a spokesman for Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, a campaign from Farmers for Free Trade and Americans for Free Trade.

The Pentagon\u2019s intelligence arm is weeks away from issuing a formal agency announcement to industry detailing the concepts and initial requirements for the new Machine Assisted Analytic Rapid Repository System (MARS) program, which was unveiled earlier this year. The call will set into motion of series of moves that culminate with a request for proposals in fiscal 2020, according to Terry Busch, the program\u2019s manager. Pros can read the full story here.\n\nSENATOR\u2019S SOCIAL MEDIA HACKED \u2014 Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s social media accounts were hacked, his office announced Thursday. Manchin is in one of the most competitive Senate races this cycle. Manchin\u2019s office said he was \u201cnotified\u201d that accounts associated with his official office had been hacked, but didn\u2019t say which accounts specifically, or who notified him. It did say his accounts had since been secured. \u201cManchin and staff are working with state and federal law enforcement officials to prevent further hacking and secure all accounts,\u201d the office said. Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill and Jeanne Shaheen have said this year that their offices endured hacking attempts, and Google also this year notified staffers and senators in both parties that foreign attackers had targeted their personal emails.\n\nSEEING THE WHOLE GAME BOARD \u2014 Despite its opaque name, the new DHS National Risk Management Center has a critical goal: It\u2019s a strategic counterpart to the agency\u2019s operational cyber watch center, an office that\u2019s meant to help companies think about the future of threats to vital infrastructure, the NRMC\u2019s No. 2 official said Thursday. \u201cEvery time I\u2019m out there talking to the industry and to the sectors, people are saying, \u2018This is right. We should have been doing this. Why haven\u2019t we been thinking more strategically down the road?\u2019\u201d Mark Kneidinger told members of the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focused on specific areas of concentration, but not how they all tie together. And that\u2019s really a key new element for the center itself.\u201d\n\nThe risk management center replaced the DHS Office of Cyber and Infrastructure Analysis and absorbed its approximately 115 employees. It also has 40 staffers detailed from other agencies, and it will hire additional workers once it determines \u201cwhere the focus needs to be\u201d and what expertise is missing. The center is still hunting for office space; it\u2019s currently housed in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, but that won\u2019t work in the long term. The team hopes to find a new facility by January.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s ISPAB session, Kneidinger said the center had asked industry partners to identify \u201cnational critical functions\u201d that spanned multiple sectors and required priority protection. A tri-sector working group, which will eventually include representatives of other sectors, met for the first time Thursday to begin that work. DHS hasn\u2019t yet established the metrics it will use to evaluate the NRMC. Kneidinger said the center would develop its performance goals once it had a better sense of its initial activities.\n\nCHANGING THE INCENTIVES \u2014 As the DHS supply chain risk management task force begins its work, agency employees are grappling with the need to establish across-the-board standards for due diligence around cybersecurity risks. One problem they face is that there are currently few incentives to spend precious time evaluating a product\u2019s supply chain integrity.\n\n\u201cMost people in the supply chain are making decisions based on their own economic interest, and they know that nobody\u2019s asking,\u201d Emile Monette, who co-chairs the task force, said at Thursday\u2019s ISPAB meeting. \u201cNobody runs around asking Dell or HP, before they purchase those laptops, \u2018Well, which motherboard is in there, and who made your microprocessors?\u2019 Those kinds of things don\u2019t tend to have a return on investment in current market conditions, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re not doing them.\u201d\n\nLarge companies do vet their suppliers and have done so for years, Monette said, but they may not be doing so in terms of cyber risk and code integrity. One goal of his task force, he said, is to bring together cybersecurity assurance testing with businesses\u2019 existing supplier vetting. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is establish some new government regime that requires some sunk cost to be lost, where commercial actors are already doing good things\u201d and they have to replace those processes, Monette said. \u201cReally, what we want to be able to do is recognize good practices in a consistent way, so that we can begin, as buyers, to reward that good practice.\u201d\n\nThe task force\u2019s executive committee will hold its first meeting in the middle of this month, followed shortly after by a meeting of the full task force. The executive committee is expected to approve three initial lines of work, Monette said: developing a proposal for a supply chain procurement rule, writing criteria for threat assessments of suppliers and figuring out how to assemble an \u201capproved products\u201d list. Monette also told ISPAB members how the task force would get things done despite its large size (60 people from across the government and two infrastructure sectors).\n\nEncryption\n\nREIN THEM IN \u2014 One of the most outspoken opponents of end-to-end encryption is using the Cambridge Analytica and Google China scandals to accuse tech companies of consistently putting profits ahead of society\u2019s best interests. In a report released Thursday, the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance pointed to Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of Facebook user data and Google\u2019s plans to launch a censored version of its search engine in China as evidence that \u201ccertain technology companies have made their decisions, not based on what might be prudent public policy, but\u2014understandably\u2014based on what is in their shareholders\u2019 economic interest.\u201d The report argued that Silicon Valley\u2019s attitude toward encryption \u2014 that companies shouldn\u2019t compromise the integrity of their security measures to facilitate government access to data \u2014 fell into the same category as the Facebook and Google controversies.\n\nTech firms \u201chave effectively established themselves as the arbiters of what data they can and should collect, and how they should or should not make that data available pursuant to legal process,\u201d Vance\u2019s report said. The Manhattan DA believes that tech companies should disregard the consensus view of cybersecurity experts and try to design strong encryption that complies with warrants for encrypted data. In Thursday\u2019s report, the fourth in a series that began in 2014, Vance\u2019s office said that federal encryption restrictions are \u201cthe most rational and least intrusive means to require device manufacturers to comply with lawful court orders in serious criminal cases upon a finding of probable cause.\u201d\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 NSA General Counsel Glenn Gerstell said the U.S. needs to act on digital privacy because the international community is pushing aggressive laws. \u2026 DOJ started a \u201cChina Initiative\u201d to, among other things, counter Beijing\u2019s cyber intrusions and supply chain threats. \u2026 Tech executives could face criminal penalties under privacy legislation introduced by Sen.

Given that it\u2019s widely viewed that \u201cDemocrats nationwide are riding a wave of enthusiasm that promises to overwhelm Republicans and flip control of the House of Representatives,\u2019\u2019 he notes, there\u2019s some stuff here which looks surprising ... and which should concern Democrats.\n\nThe key findings:\n\n-- IN THE JUNE PRIMARY: \u201cDemocrats turned out at higher rates than Republicans in three of the districts currently being targeted by the DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee). \u2026 Tom McClintock's CA-04, Dana Rohrabacher's CA-48 and the open CA-49 seat being vacated by Darrell Issa.\n\n... AND \u201cthe early vote at seven days out from the election proved to be somewhat prophetic ... as Democrats had returned a greater percentage of their mailed ballots than Republicans\u201d in those same districts.\n\nTHE PICTURE NOW: As of seven days out from the election, PDI data shows \u201ccuriously, the rate of Democratic mail ballot returns has thus far failed to outpace the rate of GOP mail ballot returns in any of the DCCC-targeted districts.\u201d\n\n-- EXAMPLE: In CA-04, \u201cRepublicans are running 1.39 percent ahead of Democrats in the percentage of mail ballots that have been returned. As it was in the primary, the gap is widest in CA-21, where 28.5% of the ballots mailed to GOP voters have been returned compared to 18.9% of those sent to Democratic voters.\u201d\n\n-- PYERS\u2019 TAKE: \u201cFor the embattled GOP incumbents attempting to hold onto their seats, one plausible hope for salvation would be if Republicans can duplicate the turnout edge they had in the June primary. It remains far too early to know whether they will ultimately be successful in that endeavor, but at seven days out, the suggestion is no longer as far-fetched as it might have previously seemed.\u201d\n\n-- DIANNE\u2019S PREDICTION: \u2018Feinstein: If women vote, they will decide\u2019 midterms,\u201d by SacBee\u2019s Alexei Koseff: Story.\n\nQUESTION: WHERE\u2019S JERRY BEEN FOR GAVIN?

Charlie Baker referred to President Donald Trump as \u201coutrageous, disgraceful and a divider\u201d during a debate Thursday night.\n\nThe harsh words were among the few areas of agreement between Republican Baker and his Democratic challenger Jay Gonzalez in their final gubernatorial debate. The comments came during a lightning round of questions, where moderators asked Baker and Gonzalez to describe Trump in three words.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"Only three,\" Baker said. \"Outrageous, disgraceful and a divider.\"\n\nGonzalez has spent the election season trying to tie Baker to Trump by way of the other Republicans on the Massachusetts ticket, who align more closely with the president. It's the only shot Democrats have against the blue-state Republican, who is ranked as the most popular governor in the country with sky-high approval ratings.\n\nAsked whether the 2018 World Series champion Boston Red Sox should go to the White House to celebrate their victory, Baker didn't answer directly.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

My guess is they get asked, people will make whatever decision they think is best for them, and I think that's OK,\" Baker said.\n\nThe first-term governor has kept his distance from the commander in chief, and has frequently pushed back on Trump's agenda on issues such as the Affordable Care Act, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and family separations. He left the presidential ballot blank rather than vote for Trump in 2016, and said he won't vote for him if he runs for reelection in 2020.\n\nBaker\u2019s approach reflects his state\u2018s low regard for the president \u2014 Massachusetts disapproves of Trump more than any other state in the country. Bay State voters gave Trump a 62 percent disapproval rating in September, according to Morning Consult. A close second in Trump disapproval ratings is neighboring Vermont, another blue state with a popular Republican governor.\n\nBaker's ability to keep Trump at arm's length has enabled him to build a wide margin in his reelection campaign. He leads Gonzalez 68-25, according to a recent poll, and a plurality (48 percent) of Democrats say they will vote for Baker. Gonzalez has support from just 45 percent of Democrats.\n\nBaker penned an op-ed in The Boston Globe this week decrying \"dark days for public discourse,\" and blamed the breakdown on \"the example set by President Trump.\"\n\nThe GOP governor waffled last month in a debate when Gonzalez asked him whether he'd vote for former Trump campaign co-chair Geoff Diehl, who is running against Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Baker said he hadn't decided who he was voting for in the Senate race, and quickly course-corrected after the debate, saying he misspoke and will vote for Diehl.\n\nThe political impetus behind Baker\u2019s initial reluctance to fully support Diehl is clear \u2014 about a third of likely voters in Massachusetts will cast ballots for both the Republican Baker and Democrat Warren, a top leader of the anti-Trump resistance, according to a WBUR report.", "poster=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201810/74/1155968404_5856060838001_5856057261001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true economy Jobs numbers boost GOP heading into midterms\n\nAccelerated growth in jobs and wages in October gave President Donald Trump a critical boost in the final days before the midterm elections.\n\n\"Wow!\" the president tweeted after the Labor Department released the numbers Friday morning. \"The U.S. added 250,000 Jobs in October - and this was despite the hurricanes. Unemployment at 3.7%. Wages UP! These are incredible numbers. Keep it going, Vote Republican!\"\n\nWow! The U.S. added 250,000 Jobs in October - and this was despite the hurricanes. Unemployment at 3.7%. Wages UP! These are incredible numbers. Keep it going, Vote Republican! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2018\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe White House couldn't have asked for a more favorable set of economic numbers to flag in the four days left before the midterms. The report gives Trump an opportunity to argue that the economy, under his leadership, is soaring. And the rapid increase in wages \u2014 the largest year-over-year gain since 2009 \u2014 could undermine Democrats' argument that economic gains under Trump have left behind working-class voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a strong signal that workers are finally beginning to see the growing economy reach their paychecks,\u201d said Elise Gould, senior economist for the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\nOne economist cautioned that the Labor Department's 3.1 percent wage figure, which measures progress over the previous 12 months, could be a statistical fluke caused by Hurricane Harvey last year. Wage growth fell in October 2017 as people returned to work.\n\n\u201cThe movement up between September and October is entirely artificial. That\u2019s math,\u201c said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nBut even Shepherdson conceded that evidence is accumulating that the wage stagnation that's baffled economists throughout the nine-year economic recovery is coming to an end. \u201cStep back from that short-term weather story,\" he said, and \"the trend in wage growth is inevitably picking up.\u201d\n\nOctober's 250,000 new jobs created was a significant improvement on the 118,000 in September. The 3.1 percent increase in wages was up from 2.8 percent in September.\n\nThe White House was quick to spike the football, telling reporters in a rare phone briefing that the October numbers exceeded their expectations.\n\n\u201cPeople who got discouraged by the Great Recession, they\u2019re coming back in droves,\u201d said Kevin Hassett, chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nBrisk economic growth under Trump \u2014 an obvious talking point for any president \u2014 has not been Trump's principal theme in the final runup to the election. Instead, Trump has focused on a caravan of Central American migrants heading north to the U.S. border; on a constitutionally dubious threat to revoke birthright citizenship; on fomenting trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China; and on a long-running battle with the Federal Reserve over raising interest rates.\n\nAsked why Trump has minimized the strong economy in his closing midterm arguments, Hassett demurred. \u201cI\u2019ve never had much of a valuable opinion about politics,\u201d he said, \u201cThis is a really good news story that\u2019s not necessarily a good political story or a bad political story.\u201c\n\nEvidence that wages are rising is not an entirely unmixed blessing for the White House. That's because it increases the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month to keep inflation in check. That, in turn, would likely depress the stock market \u2014 already turbulent in recent weeks \u2014 and prompt more fury from the president.\n\nDemocrats pushed back on the jobs report as best they could, noting that the gains under Trump are part of a trend that started under his predecessor.\n\n\u201cLet's be clear on Republican congressional ads bragging about the economy,\u201d William Spriggs, the AFL-CIO\u2019s chief economist, tweeted. \u201cTrump took office with the unemployment rate already below 5% and falling.

MCCARTHY FOR MINORITY LEADER? -- White House dispatches Trump Cabinet\n\nBy Nolan D. McCaskill ( nmccaskill@politico.com or @NolanDMcCaskill )\n\nMARK YOUR CALENDAR -- House Democrats are eyeing holding leadership elections on Nov. 28 and 29, according to multiple Democratic sources, though no date has been formally set. Democrats expect to win back the majority, so the timeline gives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) about three weeks after Election Day to corral enough votes to win back the speaker\u2019s gavel. But the size of the Democratic majority could determine Pelosi\u2019s place in the party. If she has the votes, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.) are expected to become majority leader and majority whip, respectively.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nClyburn is unlikely to challenge Hoyer for the No. 2 slot if Democrats win the House, but both leaders have expressed interest in running for speaker if Pelosi falls short. Other members have announced candidacies for lower-tier positions in leadership, including assistant Democratic leader and Democratic Caucus chair and vice chair. House Republicans will vote on their leaders for the next Congress on Nov. 14.\n\nPELOSI\u2019S POWER PLAY -- Pelosi is quietly courting Democratic candidates who have kept their distance from the Democratic leader this cycle but are most likely to win competitive races. The effort includes pushing donors toward the candidates and attending private fundraisers for those who can\u2019t be seen with her publicly. \u201cWhile it\u2019s too early to say whether she would have the 218 votes to claim the speaker\u2019s gavel should her party claim House majority, Pelosi has clearly made inroads,\u201d Rachael and Elena Schneider report. Only 11 of the 43 Democratic challengers in districts POLITICO rates lean Democrat, likely Democrat or toss-up have said they\u2019d oppose Pelosi for speaker.\n\nBut only four of those 11 confirmed they would vote against Pelosi on the House floor next year. \u201cTo ease her path, Pelosi has raised $6.7 million for \u2018Red to Blue\u2019 candidates trying to oust GOP incumbents,\u201d they write. \u201cAnd she\u2019s sent more than 30 of her staffers out to toss-up districts -- including places where candidates have distanced themselves from Pelosi on the trail.\u201d Senior Democratic sources said some candidates haven\u2019t specified what it means to not support Pelosi. Voting against her in the private caucus election and voting against her on the floor are entirely different things. Much more: https://politi.co/2JAtLUy\n\nCBC SIGNALS NO. 3 ISN\u2019T GOOD ENOUGH -- The Congressional Black Caucus wants one of its members elevated to speaker or majority leader. \u201cHoyer, especially, could be the one to face a potential challenger if the CBC backs up [Chairman Cedric] Richmond\u2019s threat,\u201d Bres and Rachael write. But Clyburn has no intention to challenge Pelosi for speaker or Hoyer for majority leader. He told POLITICO he\u2019s content returning to his former majority whip post. \u201cOne House Democratic aide close to the CBC suggested Pelosi could make a deal with the group to save her speakership if she lacks the votes to get back the gavel she lost in the 2010 GOP wave,\u201d they report.\n\nThe aide said having Pelosi back a CBC member over Hoyer \u201ccould help cushion any criticism that the next generation of leaders is being ignored.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unpopular to be an 80-year-old white guy at this moment in politics,\u201d the aide said.

The group, which already has started raising money, will vote on leadership and plan a retreat with new women lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe mission is to promote the leadership of women elected to the House in an inclusive and collaborative way,\u201d state Rep. Ann Williams told POLITICO. \u201cWe want to address systemic challenges for women not just in government but any workplace.\u201d\n\nCreating an official women\u2019s caucus comes as veteran lawmaker Barbara Flynn Currie, a House Democrat, retires. Along with being a legislative powerhouse on the floor, Currie has been a mentor and go-to person for procedural expertise.\n\nCurrie\u2019s leadership shoes are big to fill, and women lawmakers have been careful not to step on toes to say one or another of them might emerge as the next Rep. Currie.\n\nAlong with Williams, some of the natural leaders are Kelly Burke (36), Sara Feigenholtz (12), Mary Flowers (31), Robyn Gabel (18), Jehan Gordon-Booth (92) and Camille Lilly (78).\n\nSome lawmakers want Currie\u2019s majority leader position also held by a woman, especially in wake of #metoo and controversial SCOTUS hearings. \u201cThe incoming freshman class of legislators will be deeply disappointed if women\u2019s voices are not included in top levels of the House leadership,\u201d said one woman lawmaker.\n\nCurrie has held that job because she\u2019s a master legislator on the floor, a mentor to lawmakers, a student of government and \u201ca workhorse,\u201d as one legislative operative put it. With that in mind, don\u2019t be surprised if it's state Rep. Greg Harris (13), another respected workhorse, who emerges as majority leader.\n\nMORE BUZZ\n\nDemocrats are on the stump for one candidate in the next few days: Kwame Raoul.

But not this one. Gov. Charlie Baker appears to be untouchable, and leads Democratic challenger Jay Gonzalez by 43 percentage points, according a WBUR poll out Thursday. Only 2 percent of voters say they are undecided about who to vote for.\n\nWith five days until the election, Gonzalez would have needed to do more than just move the needle at Thursday night\u2018s debate. He came out swinging against Baker \u2014 but the governor really swung back.\n\nIn what seemed to be a response to Gonzalez's repeated attempts to tie him to the more Trump-like Republicans on the ticket, the governor touted his working relationship with the state's most prominent Democrats. Baker mentioned a compromise with Sen. Elizabeth Warren here, work on a lawsuit with Attorney General Maura Healey there.\n\n\"But you want to replace her with Jay McMahon,\" Gonzalez countered referring to the GOP's pro-Trump nominee for attorney general and repeating his point that Baker \"can't have it both ways,\" a jab that's been a hallmark of all three debates.\n\nBut Gonzalez can't have it both ways either, Baker said later on when Gonzalez cheered his billion-dollar-a-year plan to tax endowments on some of the state's wealthiest colleges.\n\n\"You've spent that billion dollars five times since this debate started. You spent it three times on transportation, he just spent it again on early childhood ed, he'll spend it later on K-12 education,\" Baker said. \"It's dishonest to stand here in front of the voters say you're gonna be bold and then talk about initiatives that cost billions of dollars that you don't have the dollars to pay for.\"\n\nOne point of agreement between the candidates? Harsh views on Trump. Asked to describe Trump in three words, Gonzalez went with \u201chateful, racist un-American.\u201d Baker opted for \u201coutrageous, disgraceful and a divider\u201d to describe his party\u2019s chief.\n\nWhen they head to the polls Tuesday, voters can't have it both ways either. They'll choose between a Democrat who thinks the state should dream bigger and reach higher, and a Republican who says bipartisanship is the key to steering a steady ship.

That\u2019s more than 80 percent of its terrestrial radio buys (most of the rest went to the station that broadcasts Carr\u2019s show in Mass, WRKO, and its parent company), and for a candidate who has a mere $319,388.28 on hand heading into the election.

In Cambridge, where Google employs about 1,400, the workers walked out from the company\u2019s building along Main Street just after 11 a.m. The backlash comes amid a cultural reckoning over misconduct by men in positions of power, and the technology business has been particularly visible because of a years-long trend of underrepresentation of women in important roles .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cHere\u2019s what a British dorm builder is planning for Boston,\u201d by Tim Logan, Boston Globe: \u201cBritish student housing developer Scape has big plans for Boston, and this week the company made its first move.

Mind you, it\u2019s not as though the governor has gone missing. Our Bill Mahoney notes that Cuomo has been upstate a lot, including yesterday, presiding over ceremonies to mark the completion of renovations to airports in Rochester and Syracuse. As Bill notes, it allows the governor to stand by, modestly, as local officials praise him for getting things done. Which, as fortune should have it, happens to be one of his campaign\u2019s main talking points.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nMeanwhile, the governor\u2019s four opponents debated each other last night. It was all very earnest and civic-minded and basically meaningless, since Cuomo himself wasn\u2019t there and there was no television coverage. Not exactly a high point for New York\u2019s electoral process.\n\nThe governor hasn\u2019t had a public campaign event since his debate with Marc Molinaro nine days ago. Nine days without a campaign event in late October \u2014 that\u2019s the sign of a confident incumbent.\n\nOr, on the other hand, perhaps it\u2019s a reminder that democracy in New York leaves something to be desired.\n\nLike, say, real elections for statewide office..\n\nIf the polls are right, Cuomo, Comptroller Tom DiNapoli and U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand will win overwhelming victories over their little-known and forlorn Republican foes. Attorney general candidate Tish James, a first-time statewide candidate, is a likely winner as well, although she might not pile up the kind of margins her running mates will.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that Democrats are winning all these offices. It\u2019s the margins of victory, the lopsided fundraising, and the relative anonymity of their Republican opponents \u2014 it adds up to an absence of any real choice on Election Day. And that allows incumbents like Cuomo to blow off campaigning and debates without fear of any consequences on Election Day. \u2014 Terry Golway\n\nIT\u2019S FRIDAY.

Former Goldman partner Timothy Leissner, then its head of Southeast Asia , pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violate foreign antibribery laws for helping siphon off billions of dollars from the fund, known as 1Malaysia Development Bhd, or 1MDB, according to filings unsealed Thursday.Former Goldman managing director Roger Ng, and the alleged mastermind of the fraud, Malaysian financier Jho Low, were indicted on three counts of conspiring to violate foreign antibribery laws and launder money.\n\nFor Goldman, the charges\u2014as well as a continuing investigation into the bank\u2019s own conduct\u2014come at an inflection point. Executives have spent years shining up a reputation sullied by the 2008 crisis and refashioning the elite firm as a Main Street bank. Goldman underwrote about $6.5 billion in bonds for 1MDB. The indictment alleges the bankers bribed government officials to get the bond deals, controlled offshore accounts where the stolen money was funneled and helped launder the proceeds.\u201d Wall Street Journal\u2019s Nicole Hong, Liz Hoffman and Bradley Hope\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe alleged masterminds behind a $4 billion international fraud, the investigation of which revealed how easily illicit money from around the world can find its way into major New York City real estate deals, were charged by federal prosecutors on Thursday.

Ng was also charged with bribing officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Full of international intrigue from Abu Dhabi to Hollywood, the scandal drew attention in the city for Low's ostentatious purchases made with the illicit funds, including a $200 million investment in the Park Lane Hotel, and his acquisition of several high-priced apartments in Manhattan, such as a unit at the Time Warner Center.\u201d Crain's Daniel Geiger .\n\nWHOSE STREETS? HIS STREETS: In the fusillade of criticism attending the decline of New York City's mass transit system, advocates think one leader has gotten off too easy. At a modestly attended press conference near City Hall on Thursday, those advocates urged dissatisfied bus riders to tweet out their complaints with the hashtag, #deBUSio. The new social media campaign targeting Mayor Bill de Blasio was inspired by #CuomosMTA, the wildly successful campaign targeting the governor that, more than two years after its advent, remains in heavy circulation. It's \"Only on #CuomosMTA that a local #subway train beats the express,\" tweeted @JavanBlackshear, as this article was being written. Cuomo controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which, in turn, operates the buses that ply New York City streets. Mayor Bill de Blasio controls those streets. He decides if they get bus lanes, and if the police enforce those bus lanes \u2014 or allow drivers to double-park in them and block traffic. He also controls the sidewalks that house bus shelters. For those reasons, advocates argue he deserves a good share of the blame for the slow speed of city buses, which wade through traffic at an average of roughly 7 miles an hour\u2026.

The Department of Housing Preservation and Development said today it is accepting proposals from developers for shared housing projects that include income-restricted units. The setup generally involves independently occupied rooms where tenants share kitchens and bathrooms, and buildings often include dorm-style, building-wide common spaces. The agency said the initiative, called ShareNYC, is part of a broader effort to expand the types of models used to address the city\u2019s housing crisis. In June, the city announced the launch of a different pilot program to create and renovate basement apartments. The department said it's looking for proposals that would include income diversity but also create as many units as possible for households in the lowest income tiers.

Phil Murphy and his wife Tammy paid more than $300,000 in property taxes last year on their home in Middletown, according to the couple's 2017 tax returns. Taxes on their estate along the Navesink River in Monmouth County totaled $306,541, about $100,000 more than in 2016. The Murphys prepaid their property taxes for the first half of 2018, due to the new limit on state and local tax deductions, Dan Bryan, spokesperson for the governor, said. The governor has fought back against the so-called SALT cap, which limits such deductions to $10,000, and signed a law that aims to circumvent the new policy. The couple also own homes in Germany \u2014 where Murphy previously served as U.S. Ambassador \u2014 and in Italy. They paid a combined $17,000 in taxes on those properties last year, the returns show.

Cory Booker can run for president and Senate at the same time. Gov. Phil Murphy on Thursday signed a bill \u2014 unofficially dubbed \u201cCory\u2019s Law\u201d \u2014 that would clarify that a U.S. senator or member of the U.S. House from New Jersey can appear on the primary and general election ballots for those offices as well as for the presidency. Booker, a Democrat and New Jersey\u2019s junior senator, is widely expected to run for president in 2020, the same year he\u2019s up for reelection for a second full six-year term in the Senate. In recent weeks, he\u2019s visited Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 which have the first presidential nominating contests in the nation \u2014 ostensibly to help out other candidates. Republican state Chairman Doug Steinhardt called Democrats hypocritical for rushing through the law, since some Democrats \u2014 including state Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) \u2014 in 2015 introduced legislation that would have forced then-Gov. Chris Christie to resign if he ran for president. (The bill never advanced.)

Medical weed, approved for use in the state eight years ago, is being polished, repackaged, and sold as a mainstream frontline treatment for patients as the Murphy administration relaxes the tough regulations put into place by the governor's predecessor, Chris Christie. But it was a bit of a tough sell in late October for Jeff Brown, the assistant commissioner of New Jersey's medicinal-marijuana program, when he described the new rules and the health benefits of the program to 70 health professionals gathered at the Samaritan Healthcare and Hospice Center in Voorhees Township. The questions were rapid-fire after he ended his lively pitch to convince doctors, nurses, and others that medical marijuana is real and it's easier than ever to provide authorization to allow their patients to use cannabis. What about the lack of research? How is smoking weed better than federally approved synthetic cannabis? Why do dispensary workers \u2013 not doctors \u2013 determine the dose? \u2026 Over the last five months, more than 1,500 physicians have attended seven grand-round lectures at hospitals throughout the state.\u201d Read the report\n\n\u2014\u201cAtlantic City stays on hot streak as credit bump shows everything that dies one day comes back\u201d Read the report\n\n\u2014\u201cAs sick leave law debuts, confusion remains on finer points\u201d Read the repor\n\n\u2014\u201cCan N.J. borrow $500M for schools?

Newark\u2019s engaged. The North Ward is mobilized .. In Hudson, the Hudson County Democratic Organization (HCDO) can\u2019t compete with state Senator Brian P.

According to the Constitutional Officers Association of New Jersey, which represents county clerks, 553,606 mail-in ballots had been sent to voters as of Oct. 29. In 2014 \u2014 the last time a federal midterm election was held \u2014 143,049 New Jersey voters cast their ballots by mail. County clerks had to scramble to prepare for the state\u2019s new vote-by-mail law, under which voters who sign up for absentee ballots will automatically receive them for all future elections, or until they opt out in writing. The law included a controversial section, criticized by some county clerks, requiring that mail-in ballots be sent to everyone who requested them for the 2016 general election. According to the Democratic voter data firm TargetSmart, 262,095 New Jersey ballots have already been cast by mail, compared to 102,030 at this point in 2014. According to TargetSmart\u2019s analysis, 126,577 of those ballots have come from Democrats \u2014 who have a 900,000 voter registration advantage in New Jersey \u2014 while 74,908 have come from Republicans. Another 60,610 mail-in ballots have come from unaffiliated voters or those whose party affiliation is \u201cunavailable.\u201d Read the report\n\nBECAUSE NJ ISN\u2019T USED TO NY BLAMING IT FOR THINGS \u2014 \u201cLiving in New York and sick of political ads?

The latest indicator: political ads About $95 million has been spent on political advertisements in the New York City media market this election, more than double the $40 million spent during the 2014 midterm, according to Advertising Analytics, a company that tracks political advertising.

Those are popular initiatives. But they cost money. And money is the 800-pound simian lurking over the incumbent Democrat senator who is running for re-election Tuesday, Bob Menendez. Menendez was a defender and close friend of the man who was convicted of one of the biggest frauds in the history of Medicare. Yet when it was his turn to speak Tuesday Menendez accused the Republicans of targeting that and other health-care programs. That led me to ask the following question when the governor opened the floor for questions from the media: \u2018I'm wondering how we're going to get medical costs under control when we have Senator Menendez defending one Florida eye doctor who over-billed Medicare by 73 million dollars,\u2019 I said. \u2018Would you like to comment?\u2019 That question went over with the audience like an episode of flatulence in an elevator. \u2018We'll pass on that,\u2019 said the Governor. \u2018Nice try.\u2019\u201d Read the report\n\nSHORTER GROSSMAN: OK, SO HE STIFFED LOCAL WORKING PEOPLE, BUT HE\u2019S MY GUY \u2014 \u201cPro-Trump candidate Seth Grossman: I sued Trump decades ago,\u201d by The Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s Amy S.

'All the casinos were tough to deal with in those days,' Grossman said in an interview. 'Donald Trump was in my opinion no better or no worse than the rest of the industry. I represented a security guard company. I represented a limousine company. I represented various, maybe half a dozen, vendors.

Given the events of the last few days -- and the actual threat made against my seven children last week -- I am compelled to respond to the author, dad to dad. As parents, we can all agree that America must be a place that gives kids a chance to grow up safely, allowing them to be who they are and work towards whoever they want to be.

In Palisades Park, the mayor and his mentor dueled over which man doled out more patronage jobs to cronies. For a time, Rockaway Township had two mayors. What\u2019s to explain the silly, often offensive, always embarrassing fights currently tearing these three towns apart? \u2018This just makes us look even more ridiculous,\u2019 said Paul Minenna, one of two men recently appointed to serve as mayor of Rockaway Township simultaneously. All of this outrage \u2014 some of it feigned, some of it pure and seething \u2014 is rooted in the death of a local power structure, and the scramble for power that followed. For years Rockaway Township, Palisades Park and Englewood Cliffs each had its politics controlled by a small group of insiders. By controlling municipal and school district budgets, government contracts and jobs, election rules and political donations, cronies were rewarded and opponents quashed \u2026 In Rockaway Township, where most of the players are Republicans, things grew even stranger. For years the local power structure's public face was Mayor Michael Dachisen, whose father, Stephen, had been a well-liked police chief.

Instead, families that could not come up with enough money to repay their debt to the government borrowed from a pool of funds donated by a few dozen people, according to Moshe Tress, who also goes by the first name Mark and who helped organize the fundraising effort. The money was distributed on an honor system that borrowers would repay it if and when they were able, and without interest or a fee, Tress said. Tress said such charity is second nature for Orthodox Jews, who make up the majority of Lakewood's population. But a state senator says using donations to repay benefits allowed Medicaid cheats to escape without punishment.

He spent the bulk of his D.C. career -- 39 years -- at The Wall Street Journal as a reporter and bureau chief.\n\nWITH IMMIGRATION taking such a major role in the elections, we started wondering yesterday whether there was a plan in place to fund PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S border wall. Each person we spoke to in the Capitol said they had no idea how the fight would play out, and noted that there are NO serious talks underway yet. Republicans will look to wrap this up this year. It\u2019s going to be a long eight weeks.\n\nONE CONSTANT during Trump\u2019s presidency is that he\u2019s seemed surprised by the constraints of the office. He came in as the CEO of a family real estate empire, who had to learn to deal with Congress, congressional leaders and the guardrails around the executive branch. If Democrats take the House, Trump will be further shackled. The policy preferences he\u2019s enumerating at the moment -- new asylum policies, a militarized southern border and a new tax bill -- would likely go up in smoke in divided government. There are serious concerns at the top of the GOP food chain that the White House is not fully attuned to this reality.\n\nEYE-POPPING \u2026 ALASKA REP.

Trump\u2019s campaign, Stephen K. Bannon, was interested.\n\n\u201cHe emailed the political operative Roger J.

Mr. Bannon and two other former senior campaign officials have detailed to prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, how Mr. Stone created that impression, according to people familiar with their accounts.

It started in Iran,\u201d by Zach Dorfman and Jenna McLaughlin in Yahoo News: \u201cFrom around 2009 to 2013, the U.S. intelligence community experienced crippling intelligence failures related to the secret internet-based communications system, a key means for remote messaging between CIA officers and their sources on the ground worldwide. The previously unreported global problem originated in Iran and spiderwebbed to other countries, and was left unrepaired \u2014 despite warnings about what was happening \u2014 until more than two dozen sources died in China in 2011 and 2012 as a result \u2026\n\n\u201cYahoo News\u2019 reporting on this global communications failure is based on conversations with eleven former U.S. intelligence and government officials directly familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive operations.

A few hours later, another prominent Israeli official, Naftali Bennett, took to Twitter to defend Mr. Trump from critics, including some in the American Jewish community, who said the president\u2019s divisive, inflammatory language sowed the seeds for the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in the United States in recent memory.\u201d NYT\n\nTHE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION -- \u201cWhite House concerned Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated federal rules,\u201d by WaPo\u2019s Juliet Eilperin, Josh Dawsey and Lisa Rein: \u201cThe White House is growing increasingly concerned about allegations of misconduct against Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to two senior administration officials, and President Trump has asked aides for more information about a Montana land deal under scrutiny by the Justice Department.\n\n\u201cTrump told his aides that he is afraid Zinke has broken rules while serving as the interior secretary and is concerned about the Justice Department referral, according to the officials ...\n\n\u201cBut the president has not indicated whether he will fire the former Navy SEAL and congressman and has asked for more information, the officials said.This week, Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General referred the inquiry \u2014 one of several probes into the secretary\u2019s conduct \u2014 to the Justice Department to determine whether a criminal investigation is warranted.

And it is looming especially large over the Arizona senate race.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s video series \u201cThe Midterm View\" is exploring some of the biggest political themes this year. In the fifth and final episode, we dig into how the strict rhetoric and laws in Arizona are coming to a head in the race between Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally.", "To understand how American politics got the way it is today, it helps to rewind the tape to the presidential campaign of John McCain\u2014specifically to his effort to win back a listless crowd at an otherwise forgettable campaign event in south-central Pennsylvania in the summer of 2008. The Republican nominee had opened by promising a country-over-party approach to politics, recalling his compromises with Democrats like Ted Kennedy: \u201cWe\u2019ll have our disagreements, but we\u2019ve got to be respectful.\u201d The Republican crowd sat in silence. McCain then denounced Vladimir Putin\u2019s incursion into independent Georgia, warning that \u201chistory is often made in remote, obscure places.\u201d No one seemed interested in that particular remote and obscure place.\n\nMcCain just couldn\u2019t connect with the crowd, until he unleashed a garbled riff about how Congress shouldn\u2019t be on recess when gasoline prices were soaring. \u201cMy friends,\u201d he said, \u201cthe message we want to send to Washington, D.C. is: \u2018Come back off your vacation, go back to Washington, fix our energy problems, and drill and drill now, drill offshore and drill now!\u2019\u201d It lacked the poetic brevity of the \u201cDrill, baby, drill\u201d line his future running mate, Sarah Palin, would use to fire up crowds, but the York Expo Center suddenly erupted with raucous cheers. It felt visceral, almost violent, as if McCain had given his supporters permission to drill someone they hated. McCain flashed an uneasy grin, like a kid who had just set off his first firecracker, delighted but also a bit frightened by its power. He wasn\u2019t really a drill-baby-drill politician, but he could sense his party drifting toward drill-baby-drill politics.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Republicans clamoring for drilling that day in Pennsylvania weren\u2019t reacting to the science of global warming or the economics of petroleum or the geopolitics of energy policy. They loved the idea of drilling now, and drilling everywhere, because their political enemies hated it. They were enjoying the primal experience of owning the libs, lashing out at the smug Democratic hippies who wanted to take away their SUVs and guns and Big Gulps. Oil exploration is a complex issue, but in the arena it was just another blunt-force weapon in a simple culture war.\n\nA decade later, McCain is dead, bipartisanship is just about dead\u2014his funeral felt like the rare exception that proved the rule\u2014and the leader of the Republican Party is a world-class polarizer who mocked McCain\u2019s service while cozying up to Putin on his way to the White House. President Donald Trump has pioneered a new politics of perpetual culture war, relentlessly rallying his supporters against kneeling black athletes, undocumented Latino immigrants and soft-on-crime, weak-on-the-border Democrats. He reverses the traditional relationship between politics and governance, weaponizing policy to mobilize his base rather than mobilizing his base to change policy. And in the Trump era, just about every policy issue is a wedge issue, not only traditional us-against-them social litmus tests like abortion, guns, feminism and affirmative action, or even just the president\u2019s pet issues of immigration and trade, which he has wielded as cultural cudgels to portray Americans as victims of foreign exploiters. These days, even climate change, infrastructure policy and other domestic issues normally associated with wonky panels at Washington think tanks have been repackaged into cultural-resentment fodder.\n\nThe Friday Cover Sign up for POLITICO Magazine\u2019s email of the week\u2019s best, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.

But it\u2019s also dangerous. It\u2019s as if the rowdy cultural slap-fight the kids were having in the back seat has moved into the front, threatening to swerve the national car off the road. Transforming difficult analytical questions into knee-jerk emotional battlegrounds will dramatically increase the danger that thoughtless short-term choices will throw off our long-term national trajectory. And even beyond the impact on the quality of our public policy decisions, the ferocious politicization of everything is not healthy for the American body politic, which is why a Russian troll farm used fake social media accounts to gin up protests and counterprotests about hot-button issues like police shootings and Trump\u2019s border wall. Our foreign adversaries like it when we yell at one another.\n\nHonestly, though, we don\u2019t need much prodding. Democrats and Republicans are increasingly self-segregated and mutually disdainful, each camp deploying the furious language of victimhood to justify its fear and loathing of the gullible deplorables in the other. One side boycotts Chick-fil-A (over gay rights), Walmart (over sweatshops) and companies that do business with the National Rifle Association, while the other boycotts Nike (over Colin Kaepernick), Starbucks (over refugees, gay marriage and non-Christmas-specific holiday cups) and companies that stop doing business with the NRA. We live in an era of performative umbrage. Every day is Festivus, a ritual airing of our grievances about Kathy Griffin, Roseanne Barr, fake news, toxic masculinity and those fancy coffee machines that Sean Hannity\u2019s viewers decided to destroy for some reason. Every decision about where to shop or what to drive or what to watch is now an opportunity to express our political identities. The 24-hour news cycle has become a never-ending national referendum on Trump.\n\nIllustration by Ben Fearnley\n\nPolitically, it makes sense that debates over highly technical challenges like energy and climate change have been transformed into shirts-and-skins identity issues. Ron DeSantis, the Trump-loving Republican former congressman running for governor of Florida, recently proclaimed that he\u2019s \u201cnot in the pews of the Church of Global Warming Leftists,\u201d a very 2018 way of expressing opposition to carbon regulations, renewable energy subsidies and other forms of climate action. He wasn\u2019t disputing that the planet is getting hotter, or questioning the scientific data on the dangers of fossil fuels. He was clarifying which team he\u2019s on, and more specifically which team he isn\u2019t on, the team of tree-hugging scolds who look down on ordinary Americans for eating bacon and using plastic straws. You can see that sentiment expressed in less genteel ways if you search YouTube for \u201crolling coal,\u201d where pollution-porn videos flaunt diesel trucks (sometimes dubbed \u201cPrius repellents\u201d) retrofitted to spew thick clouds of black smoke into the air, the transportation version of a middle finger to the opposing tribe. And there\u2019s no denying that the opposing tribe of conspicuous composters and recyclers and Tesla drivers have their own identitarian rituals that pointedly broadcast their wokeness.\n\nBut while DeSantis may win points with his base by distancing himself from the Church of Global Warming Leftists, just as Trump does by dismissing global warming as a hoax manufactured in China, global warming is real, no matter who belongs to its church. Greenhouse gases don\u2019t care whether they\u2019re a wedge issue. Culture-war politics are often a crutch, a look-at-the-shiny-ball distraction, an easy way to shift complicated policy debates from inconvenient facts to emotion and identity.\n\nAs long as America keeps sorting itself into two factions divided by geography, ethnicity and ideology, pitting a multiracial team of progressives who live in cities and inner-ring suburbs against a white team of conservatives who live in exurbs and rural areas, this is what debates about public policy\u2014or for that matter about the FBI, the dictator of North Korea and the credibility of various sexual assault allegations\u2014will look like. We will twist the facts into our partisan narratives. The self-inflicted wounds will infect more and more of our lives. And if you want something else to worry about, consider where it might be spreading next.\n\n\n\n***\n\nPolitics has always been adversarial. Traditionally, though, we\u2019ve had a fairly robust national consensus about a fairly broad set of goals\u2014a strong defense, a decent safety net, freedom from excessive government interference\u2014even though we\u2019ve squabbled over how to achieve them. What\u2019s different about drill-baby-drill politics is the transformation of even nonpartisan issues into mad-as-hell battles of the bases, which makes it virtually impossible for politicians to solve problems in a two-party system. Cooperation and compromise start to look like capitulation, or even treasonous collusion with the enemy.\n\nTake infrastructure spending, which was once reasonably uncontroversial, at least in principle. Today, many conservatives portray it as a liberal plot to siphon rural tax dollars into urban bike paths, subways, and high-speed rail boondoggles that unions will build and Democratic city slickers will use. The Trump administration actually changed the rules of the most prominent grant program for local transportation projects so that it explicitly favors rural projects, infuriating liberals who now see it as a slush fund for sprawl roads to nowhere serving out-in-the-boonies Trump voters. The war over Obamacare has a similar mine-versus-yours feel; many Republicans see it as a scheme to redistribute tax dollars (and the hard-earned Medicare benefits of older Americans) to lazy and entitled Barack Obama voters, while Democrats see the intense opposition to universal health care as generational warfare on behalf of the aging white GOP base.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the opposing tribe of conspicuous composters and recyclers and Tesla drivers have their own identitarian rituals that pointedly broadcast their wokeness.\n\nTrump has never shown much interest in the details of policy, but he does understand how to use the levers of government to reward his allies and punish his enemies. He froze the pay of federal employees, a key Democratic constituency, while approving a $12 billion bailout for farmers, who, like other industries, have taken a hit from his trade wars, but, unlike other industries, tend to vote as a Republican bloc. Trump\u2019s tax bill hammered blue states by reining in deductions for state and local taxes, while his energy policies have provided relief to red states that rely heavily on fossil fuels. His administration has picked fights with California, the epicenter of coastal-elite Blue America, over fuel-efficiency standards, net neutrality and water policy.\n\nPolicy skirmishes tend to metastasize into cultural battles when they involve identity issues, and after spending time on the campaign trail recently, I got the sense the next big Republican culture war will be a war on college. For generations, the notion of higher education as a ladder of opportunity for everyone has been an anodyne nonpartisan talking point, even if Democrats and Republicans disagreed on the appropriate levels of federal funding and regulation. But Republican attitudes are changing. In Ohio, I heard them talk about taxpayer-funded school bureaucrats who trick kids into believing that expensive and often useless liberal-indoctrination universities are the only way to get ahead in life; siphoning students away from vocational programs that could prepare them for well-paying jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not a coincidence that this shift is happening at a time when college-educated voters are trending Democratic and noncollege whites have been Trump\u2019s most reliable constituency. Policies that hurt colleges, like policies that hurt cities, are policies that hurt Democrats. To listen to pols talk about college these days is to watch a wedge issue in its embryonic stage, as substantive questions about the cost and relevance of higher ed, the burdens of student debt, the adequacy of worker training and the power of political correctness on campus start to morph into red-meat attacks on pointy-headed elitists who look down on ironworkers and brainwash America\u2019s youth. Republicans are starting to fit the Democratic push for universal free college into their larger critique of the Democratic urge to hand out free stuff to Democratic voters. And they\u2019re portraying a liberal arts education as a culturally liberal thing, like kale or Kwanzaa or reusable shopping bags.\n\nIllustration by Ben Fearnley\n\nI saw a soft-edged version of this anti-college theme at a manufacturing roundtable that Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for governor, held in September in Youngstown. DeWine listened for an hour as a group of executives complained how teenagers are constantly told they need college degrees to get ahead in life, how students who might flourish in programs to prepare them for factory jobs are steered into mainstream classes they hate. DeWine perked up when the director of a local career center said that only 12 percent of students who pursue four-year degrees end up earning enough to pay off their loans and that many never learn about other options. \u201cThe goal should be exposing kids to more things, not forcing them into anything,\u201d DeWine interjected.\n\nIt was an earnest policy discussion\u2014the mild-mannered DeWine is not very Trump-like\u2014and the main policy takeaway seemed to be a positive call for better vocational options. It reminded me of Florida Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s argument during the 2016 campaign that America needed fewer philosophers and more welders. This is a debatable point, and Rubio himself recently changed his mind about it after reading the Stoics; he now believes America needs philosophers, too. There\u2019s voluminous evidence that post-secondary degrees lead to higher incomes and better life outcomes, despite the popular narratives about art history majors moving back home with their parents, and it\u2019s a good bet Rubio and the executives at DeWine\u2019s roundtable want their own kids to go to leafy colleges with decent literature departments. Nevertheless, the focus on how to produce more welders is a legitimate policy concern, based on a serious assessment of a gap between what American students learn and what employers want them to learn.\n\nThe Widening Gap Democrats\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 opinions on policy-related issues have grown further apart. IMMIGRATION\n\nPercentage of Democrats and Republicans who answered that immigration was, on the whole, a good thing for the country at that time.\n\n\n\nGLOBAL WARMING\n\nPercentage of Democrats and Republicans who answered that they worried about global warming \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount.\u201d\n\n\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nPercentage of Democrats and Republicans who answered that, yes, it is the responsibility of the federal government to make sure all Americans have health care coverage.\n\nSource: Gallup\n\nA few days later, at a campaign event hosted by Ohio Congressman Jim Renacci, who is running for Senate on a much Trumpier platform than DeWine\u2019s, I saw hints of a less substantive campaign against higher education. It was more reminiscent of Governor Scott Walker\u2019s red-meat attacks on the University of Wisconsin as an ivory-tower bastion of left-wing professors ripping off hardworking taxpayers. The underlying theme was that liberal elites have rigged the system to funnel Americans into colleges that look down on the kind of white working-class families who supported Trump. Speaking to a group of staunch Republicans at a northeast Ohio soybean farm, Renacci told a story about an opioid addict he met who fell in with a bad crowd because an uncaring taxpayer-financed educational establishment told him college was the only plausible path to success. Renacci said the addict plaintively told him: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to learn trigonometry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to stop pushing everyone into college,\u201d Renacci said. \u201cLet\u2019s get this stigma off our backs: You can live the American dream without college.\u201d\n\nRenacci\u2019s event was supposed to be about trade, but none of the local farmers expressed any concern about the beating they\u2019re taking from Trump\u2019s trade war. What they expressed concern about was illegal immigrants who commit crimes and demand handouts; the deep state; Democrats who want to steal from Medicare to fund Obamacare; and Antifa thugs. Even though their party controls Washington and Columbus, they believe they\u2019re under siege; one 60-something farmer told me he\u2019s afraid to speak out because \u201cradical Democrats will burn your house down.\u201d When I said that seemed unlikely in the rural expanses of Ashtabula County, he said I should check out the angry leftist millennials he\u2019s seen when he\u2019s visited the Ohio State campus, \u201cwearing boots and backpacks and shouting stupid slogans.\u201d I asked him whether he supports government spending on higher education for those millennials, and he shot back: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I don\u2019t support: free college for illegals and higher taxes for me.\u201d\n\nThere are real policy debates to be had over higher education, and they\u2019re important. U.S. universities aren\u2019t blameless: They\u2019ve jacked up their tuition costs much faster than inflation, overpopulated their faculties with liberals, failed to hold themselves accountable for the employment outcomes of their students and policed speech to the point that they look more concerned with stamping out \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d than promoting free inquiry. At the same time, a lot of work has been done to try to make colleges, especially community colleges, more relevant to the job market; DeWine\u2019s roundtable event highlighted a model partnership between local educators and manufacturers. The Obama administration also established tough new rules limiting federal dollars to institutions that don\u2019t move students into gainful employment. Ironically, the Trump administration is trying to roll back those rules, as well as others providing relief to students defrauded by Trump University-style for-profit diploma mills.\n\nWhat they expressed concern about was illegal immigrants who commit crimes and demand handouts; the deep state; Democrats who want to steal from Medicare to fund Obamacare; and Antifa thugs.\n\nBut modern politics isn\u2019t about these nuances of policy substance. It isn\u2019t evidence-based. The debate over immigration isn\u2019t really about measured wage effects or growth effects; it\u2019s about whether a diverse America is the \u201creal\u201d one, and whether nonwhite newcomers make the country great. The Trump fans who came to see Renacci in Ashtabula County didn\u2019t care any more about the details of higher education studies than they cared about the details of Paul Manafort\u2019s guilty plea or our trade deficit with Canada. (It\u2019s actually a surplus, a fact that will change approximately zero minds about Trump\u2019s trade rhetoric.) The signal of substance breaks through the noise of politics so rarely that the noise has become the signal.\n\nNevertheless, substance does end up affecting people\u2019s lives. Our higher education system is still one of America\u2019s most valuable competitive assets, and breaking it in a fit of cultural fury would be the national equivalent of choking on diesel smoke to own the libs. Meanwhile, polls show that Americans, and particularly Republicans, are already increasingly suspicious that four-year colleges are really worth the money. That could affect their future choices and limit their own children\u2019s options, all because \u201ccollege\u201d now feels like the other team.\n\n\n\n***\n\nDonald Trump was not the first Republican president to exploit America\u2019s divisions. Think of Richard Nixon rallying his \u201csilent majority\u201d against bra-burning, free-loving, acid-dropping hippies, or even George H.W. Bush running against flag-burning and Willie Horton. And Trump didn\u2019t create the so-called Big Sort of Americans into two ideologically polarized, geographically and racially segregated, mutually suspicious partisan camps. The rift between the mostly white camp of gun-owning, evangelical-church-going Fox News watchers who live relatively spread out and the more diverse camp of Whole Foods-shopping, funky-cafe-going NPR listeners who live closer together has been widening for decades.\n\nTrump may be America\u2019s leading culture warrior, but a war requires two armies. The frequent journalistic safaris into the right side of America\u2019s divide tend to focus on the unwavering faith that Trump supporters have in Trump, but polls suggest the left side is just as prone to motivated reasoning about politics, and perhaps even more consumed by anger over politics. In a Pew Research Center survey, 47 percent of liberal Democrats said that if a friend supported Trump, it would put a strain on their friendship, and 68 percent of all Democrats said it\u2019s \u201cstressful and frustrating\u201d to talk to Trump supporters. Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida, had to fire his youth outreach director for posing for an Instagram post while wearing a shirt featuring the 2016 electoral map, with blue states labeled \u201cUnited States of America\u201d and Trump states labeled \u201cDumbfuckistan.\u201d It was a perfect manufactured-outrage episode for our time\u2014needless to say, similar shirts on which the blue states are labeled Dumbfuckistan are available for purchase\u2014but it did reflect a common Democratic disdain for Republican rubes in the provinces.\n\nIllustration by Ben Fearnley\n\nSo the culture war is not all about Trump. But Trump has a destructive genius for exploiting the culture war, exploding Washington\u2019s norms of decorum and euphemism to trash his adversaries and torture the truth, portraying Puerto Ricans as ungrateful, immigrants as dangerous and Democrats as un-American. You\u2019re with him or you\u2019re with the terrorists. And the rest of Washington, which was already uncelebrated for civility, has followed him into perennial attack mode, to the point that even Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh bellowed partisan conspiracy theories during his confirmation hearing.\n\nTrump\u2019s entire Make America Great Again theme was always a cultural call to arms, deeply rooted in nostalgia for the supposedly good old days of the 1950s, before the messy disruptions of Black Lives Matter or #MeToo, before the steel industry had to worry about global competition or the coal industry faced limits on pollution. And since he\u2019s abandoned his populist promises to crack down on Wall Street, build $1 trillion worth of infrastructure projects and get every American good health care, he\u2019s doubling down on his racial and cultural messaging to his white working-class supporters, betting his attacks on the intelligence of LeBron James and CNN\u2019s Don Lemon will overshadow his efforts to strip protections for pre-existing conditions and gut oversight of financial rip-offs. So far, it seems like a good bet.\n\nOur higher education system is still one of America\u2019s most valuable competitive assets, and breaking it in a fit of cultural fury would be the national equivalent of choking on diesel smoke to own the libs.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to have serious public debates about the massive changes in public policy that Trump is pursuing, because there\u2019s no longer a clear path for facts and logic to break through the daily onslaught of demonization and obfuscation. We\u2019re too busy fighting to think. It\u2019s especially tough to have an evidence-based debate about an issue like trade when Trump proclaims at one rally that his tariffs have prompted U.S. Steel to open seven new plants, and after fact-checkers point out the actual number is zero, he ups the number to eight or nine at his next rally. He understands that modern political debates don\u2019t depend on facts or logic. Where you stand\u2014on questions of whether to believe Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers and whether there was any collusion with Russia, as well as questions about corporate tax rates or lifetime insurance caps\u2014depends almost entirely on where you sit. Deficits are bad when your team is in charge, benign when my team is in charge. I\u2019m being denied due process by a witch hunt, but you belong in jail. I\u2019m no puppet; you\u2019re the puppet.\n\nThis is presumably how entire countries turn into Dumbfuckistan. The solutions to our political forever war are pretty obvious: Americans need to rebuild mutual trust and respect. We need to try to keep open minds, to seek information rather than partisan ammunition. We need to agree on a shared foundation of facts from authoritative sources. But those words looked ridiculous the moment I typed them. Americans are not on the verge of doing any of those things. Once the dogs of war have been unleashed, it\u2019s hard to call them back. And we should at least consider the possibility that we\u2019re fighting this forever war because we like it.\n\nThe thing I remember most about Trump\u2019s rallies in 2016, especially the auto-da-f\u00e9 moments in which he would call out various liars and losers who didn\u2019t look like the faces in his crowds, was how much fun everyone seemed to be having. The drill-baby-drill candidate would drill the Mexicans, drill the Chinese, drill the gun-grabbers, drill all the boring Washington politicians who had made America not-great. It sure as hell wasn\u2019t boring. It was a showman putting on a show, a culture-war general firing up his internet troops. It wasn\u2019t a real war, like the one that Trump skipped while John McCain paid an unimaginable price, but it made the spectators feel like they were not just spectating, like they had joined an exhilarating fight. They got the adrenaline rush, the sense of being part of something larger, the foxhole camaraderie of war against a common enemy, without the physical danger.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how a fight like that would ever end.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.", "The massacre at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue last Saturday announced with chilling clarity that a lethal strain of anti-Semitism, long presumed to be peripheral in post-World War II America, had returned with a vengeance. Harbingers had been appearing for months: the online harassment of Jewish journalists during the 2016 presidential race; the anti-Jewish themes deployed by Donald Trump and his campaign; the painted swastikas, toppled gravestones, neo-Nazi handbills, threats to Jewish community centers, and other incidents of hate that made local and national headlines since the election; and the siege of a Charlottesville synagogue during the right-wing rampage there in 2017. Yet even those warning signs somehow seemed aberrant, and the public outcry in each case told us that our nation\u2019s underlying commitment to ethno-religious pluralism remained sturdy.\n\nWhy such confidence? It is true that over the course of the past 75 years, hard-right anti-Semitic voices were\u2014though never eradicated\u2014significantly sidelined. But such security might also be because some of the worst episodes of anti-Semitic violence in American history have somehow faded from memory. Historians describe physical violence against Jews in America as having been rare\u2014painting the United States, in the words of one authority, as having \u201cknown no pogroms.\u201d The abiding image of America as a haven from the bloody religious violence of Europe, for Jews as for others, reinforce the belief that it can\u2019t happen here. In other words, caught up in an idealized picture of America, we\u2019ve let some of the troubling details drop out of our historical narrative.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut according to Stephen Norwood, a senior historian at the University of Oklahoma, anti-Semitism in the United States has been \u201cmuch more deeply entrenched than most scholars acknowledged.\u201d In a startling academic article from 2003, Norwood amassed considerable evidence to refute this sunny picture of America as a sanctuary from brutal violence. In particular, the article tells the story of a right-wing Irish group called the Christian Front, inspired by the wildly popular radio preacher Charles Coughlin, that regularly menaced Jews\u2014especially in Boston and New York\u2014during the final years of World War II. Starting in 1942 and continuing for more than a year, Norwood recounts, marauding bands of Irish Catholic youths stalked and assaulted the Jews of urban communities like Dorchester and Mattapan in Boston and Washington Heights in New York, as police officers and even elected officials looked the other way. Harrowing as this episode was, few Americans know of it; it was even omitted from a very good recent list of anti-Semitic incidents that ran in the Atlantic.\n\nThe role of Coughlin is significant, as he was a key figure in fostering a particular strain of angry right-wing populism, especially popular among American Catholics, that would organize the darkest impulses of American conservatism for many decades thereafter. Back in the 1980s and 1990s it went by the name of paleoconservatism. Its exponents were fond of conspiracy theories, eager to mobilize the power of the masses against alleged elites, often isolationist, protectionist, and nativist, and either overtly or subtly anti-Semitic in character. In the 1950s, its avatar was Joe McCarthy, the rabidly anti-Communist senator from Wisconsin. In our lifetimes, it was best embodied by Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan aide Pat Buchanan, who despite spouting anti-Jewish and racist sentiments was one of the most visible television pundits of the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. Its best known spokesman today is probably Steve Bannon\u2014although one could include Trump himself.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t that Trump is an anti-Semite (though he has said anti-Semitic things) or that he would sanction anti-Jewish violence (he wouldn\u2019t). Rather, it\u2019s that for the first time we have a vessel for Coughlinite ideas, however transmuted, in the White House\u2014raising worries that their darker expression may become common once again.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe years before World War II were difficult ones for American Jews. On the one hand, this was the era in which liberal ideas about equality spread widely in the United States; looking abroad at the vicious anti-Semitism of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Americans defined their values in opposition to those totalitarian regimes, placing civil liberties, religious pluralism and toleration at the center of the national creed. On the other hand, the Depression brought forth ugly resentments that took anti-Semitic form, including toward President Franklin Roosevelt, whom anti-Semites called \u201cRosenfeld\u201d and whose policies they called the \u201cJew Deal.\u201d Many prominent Americans espoused nakedly anti-Jewish views, including carmaker Henry Ford, whose Dearborn Independent published conspiracy theories about international Jewry in the 1920s, and Charles Lindbergh, who in 1941 claimed American Jews, possessing outsized influence in Hollywood, the media, and the Roosevelt administration, were pushing the nation into war against its interests. In 1939, the German American Bund held a rally of 20,000 people in Madison Square Garden, which was decorated with swastikas and other Nazi iconography (footage of which has been circulating on social media in recent years).\n\nA key figure in fomenting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories was Coughlin, who years earlier supported Roosevelt and advocated vaguely left-wing redistributionist egalitarianism but whose populism steadily took on a bitter, aggrieved and, eventually, fascistic tone. Past the peak of his popularity in 1938, he nonetheless commanded a large, loyal fan base, especially among Irish Americans, some of whom formed the Christian Front, a vigilante group. In 1940, the FBI arrested 13 members of the Front for plotting to bomb the offices of the Forward, the Jewish paper, and to assassinate Jewish members of Congress.\n\nAccording to Norwood, these arrests didn\u2019t dent the Christian Front\u2019s popularity. By 1942, its members\u2014and toughs not explicitly affiliated with it\u2014undertook a relentless monthslong campaign of physical intimidation, beatings and slashings that probably warrant the name pogrom. In what the New York Post called \u201can almost daily occurrence,\u201d Jews in Dorchester, Roxbury and Mattapan (and, to some extent, in Jewish neighborhoods of New York) were attacked and beaten on the streets, in parks, with some victims stabbed or disfigured, and some girls having had their clothes ripped off. Gangs robbed Jewish merchants, defiled synagogues and cemeteries, and committed other acts of vandalism. Jewish Girl Scout troops and other clubs had to stop meeting.\n\nJewish residents of these besieged neighborhoods told their elected officials that they were living in \u201cmortal fear.\u201d Some non-Jewish leaders spoke up for them\u2014including Frances Sweeney, a leading anti-fascist in Boston; the black New York City Councilman Adam Clayton Powell Jr.; and New York Attorney General Thomas Dewey, who was assailing the Christian Front in his (ultimately victorious) bid for governor in 1942. But most political leaders shrugged. In New York, Dewey\u2019s opponent, Democrat John Bennett, was sympathetic to the Coughlinites. Others, such as Massachusetts Governor Leverett Saltonstall and Boston Mayor Maurice Tobin, both liberals, weren\u2019t anti-Semitic but probably feared alienating Irish voters. Even New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, himself half-Jewish, downplayed reports as isolated occurrences\u2014an increasingly untenable claim as the violence mounted.\n\nThe police disingenuously wrote off reports as run-of-the-mill juvenile delinquency or even sided with the thugs. In one case, two 17-year-old Jewish boys, Jacob Hodas and Harvey Blaustein, were set upon by a mob and then were themselves arrested and roughed up by the police. All the while, the Catholic Church did nothing, and no major newspaper covered the violence until the liberal New York paper PM finally ran an expos\u00e9 in late 1943. Pressure then mounted on Saltonstall, the Boston police commissioner was soon replaced, and the violence began to abate.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the replacement of the police chief alone caused the violence to cease. (It diminished in New York, too.) The end of the crisis coincided with the war winding down and Americans learning the full nature of Hitler\u2019s plans to exterminate European Jewry. Even though prejudice lingered, explicit anti-Semitism became unacceptable in mainstream politics. The idea of what historian Kevin Schultz has called \u201cTri-Faith America,\u201d which had gained currency before the war, came to be widely accepted. And as another historian, Stuart Svonkin has written, groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee poured their energies into interfaith programs, educational efforts, and research into the social and psychological nature of prejudice and bigotry, relying on some of the leading social psychologists of the day. One of them, Gordon Allport, whose book The Nature of Prejudice became a canonical work in the field, was sent by Saltonstall in 1945 to give lectures to the Boston police force in what Norwood deems the first-ever training course in prejudice awareness for policemen. These ideas and practices made their way into educational curricula and the broader culture, influencing generations of American children about prejudice and racism. (They should be revived today.)\n\nThe intervening years have hardly been free of anti-Semitism, even of a violent kind. But incidents have been sporadic, rarely tied to organized movements. Figures like Pat Buchanan and Joseph Sobran certainly maintained followings on the right (and Buchanan sustained his ubiquitous television presence), although in time they too were marginalized. To the extent that anti-Semitism has crept into mainstream discourse, it has tended to come from the left\u2014commingling with animus toward the state of Israel. The attacks of 9/11 in particular prompted essays, like those written this week, prophesying that a dark strain of anti-Semitism had resurfaced. Some left anti-Semitism mirrors that of the right\u2014with conspiratorial thinking, claims of Jewish disloyalty or un-Americanness, and fantasies that Jews will take a peace-loving America to war\u2014just as the far left\u2019s blend of isolationism, protectionism and anti-immigration sentiment finds a reflection in Trump\u2019s international agenda.\n\nAnti-Semitic attacks are on the rise, but it would be premature to say anti-Semitism has returned to what it was in the 1940s. One big difference between then and now is that public officials have unanimously condemned the violence in Pittsburgh and elsewhere. But, we might be moving in the wrong direction. As many have pointed out, Trump\u2019s response has still been grossly inadequate, as he continues to demonize George Soros with tropes out of \u201cThe International Jew,\u201d and other Republicans have persisted in running campaign ads and tweeting messages with anti-Semitic overtones. How long the official consensus against anti-Semitism will endure remains uncertain. Recently, historians of the U.S. have been asking whether core features of the postwar order that seemed solid or even permanent\u2014a mixed-economy welfare state, American leadership in the world, objectivity as the lodestar of journalism\u2014are looking more like products of a passing era, what one scholar called a \u201clong exception.\u201d It\u2019s now an open question whether the taboo against anti-Semitism was a product of that long exception as well.\n\nDavid Greenberg, a professor of history and journalism and media studies at Rutgers, is a contributing editor at Politico Magazine.

We\u2019ve usually treated cultural fights as a sideshow to the serious business of governance, but right now it\u2019s hard not to feel that the culture war has morphed into the main event. \u201cConservative vs. liberal\u201d feels so dated. Now it\u2019s personal: Do you drive a Prius hybrid or an F-150 pickup? Watch Fox News or listen to NPR? Buy your gear at Cabela\u2019s or REI? Wrap yourself in the First Amendment or the Second? You don\u2019t even have to know what the fight is about to know which side you\u2019re on.\n\nNormally this is the kind of rift national leaders can help bridge, invoking the usual formulas about our shared values and history of inclusion. For the past two years, however, we\u2019ve had a president with a gift for intuiting fault lines and prying them open with a crowbar. Who would have imagined, before Donald Trump, that Republicans would be boycotting the NFL? That buying sneakers would seem like a political decision? That \u201cfree speech\u201d would become a kind of code for owning the libs?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn this issue of Politico Magazine, with midterm elections upon us, we wanted to look at the state of the fight, and what it\u2019s doing to us. As Politico Magazine senior writer Michael Grunwald finds in our opening essay, there\u2019s a good reason to worry about the national costs of the spreading war: As us-vs.-them politics grows past lifestyle issues into complicated policy topics like infrastructure and energy, it leaves our political system increasingly unable to settle the arguments we rely on it to solve.\n\nWhat does the war look like up close? One way to see it is our cover, a loaded parking-lot faceoff created by illustrator Justin Metz. Another is on our back page, where you\u2019ll find a handy field guide to 2018\u2019s new culture warriors. And we\u2019ve worked with consumer-data firm Simmons Research to assemble a portrait of red-vs.-blue America along what might be the most accessible American spectrum of all: brand preferences. (Do you eat Republican cheese? Find out.)\n\nSome battles in the culture war actually do end. Why? Politico Magazine chief political correspondent Tim Alberta takes an authoritative look at the Republican war on pornography, and why the GOP simply dropped it\u2014even as porn exploded into a far more pervasive, and possibly dangerous, social force.\n\nIn the realm of ideas, writer Amelia Lester offers the first serious profile of Quillette, the online magazine that has emerged as a vehicle for the intellectual cultural war\u2014a home for the new \u201cfree-thinking\u201d center-right, which liberals worry is a stalking horse for much darker intellectual ideas. In party politics, New York political writer David Freedlander finds the Democrats in the grips of their own culture clash, divided along race and class lines. And Politico White House correspondent Ben Schreckinger investigates what became of the right-wing provocateurs of the Trump campaign. Plus, if you want to appreciate Trump\u2019s particular talent for working a cultural rift, take a look at his canny use of the word \u201celite,\u201d which he once embraced, then reviled and is now trying to reappropriate. Politico Magazine senior writer Michael Kruse has the backstory.\n\nAnd finally, in a project we\u2019re proud to present, we sent Lauren Markham, a writer with deep experience in Latin American reporting, to probe the true effects of Trump\u2019s tough new border policies on the people they\u2019re supposed to discourage from immigrating. The results aren\u2019t what the policy\u2019s architects might expect at all. The culture, it turns out, is subject to change from forces we can\u2019t always control\u2014and which aren\u2019t likely to stop.\n\nStephen Heuser is print editor of Politico Magazine.\n\nThis article tagged under: Culture Club\n\nEditors Note", "You know who matters in the 2018 midterms? Donald Trump! But not just Donald Trump. Control of the Senate rests in part on what voters think of the president of the United States, but it will also be determined by local disputes and regional quirks\u2014demographics and issues, but also mythmaking and self-conception. In this series\u2014this is the eighth, and last, article\u2014Politico Magazine asked an expert on a state with a crucial statewide race to explain what matters there that doesn\u2019t matter anywhere else.\n\nThere is going to be a lot of gnashing of teeth and rending of garments around the country if Beto O\u2019Rourke loses his quixotic, Harry vs. Voldemort quest to snatch Ted Cruz\u2019s Senate seat. Outside Texas, the defeat will most likely be interpreted as another failed attempt to turn Texas purple, with all the accompanying stereotypes hauled in as proof: All those church-going, bronco-busting, tobacco-chewing conservatives and their even more right-wing wives have done it again. And if Beto couldn\u2019t do it, who can? As myriad stories have reported, Texas Democrats haven\u2019t won a statewide race since George W. Bush trounced then-Governor Ann Richards in 1994. The state hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic senator since Lloyd Bentsen in 1988.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke supposedly had a way around that. He would visit every one of Texas\u2019 254 counties and shake the hand of every potential voter, Democrat or Republican. Talk with and listen to them one on one, and put forth a message of, well, hope and change. It seemed like a great time to ride that great Latino wave to victory. What self-respecting Latino wouldn\u2019t vote for him with all that talk out of Washington about building walls and all those reprehensible (to Democrats, at least) actions like separating undocumented parents from their children at the border? Maybe Beto wasn\u2019t Hispanic, but he had a Latin diminutive for his nickname and he spoke beautiful Spanish. He was young, articulate and urbane even if he lived in El Paso. (\u201cThe most frequent adjective used is Kennedy-esque,\u201d Cruz likes to say, using the near infinite number of adoring Beto profiles as yet another opportunity for passive aggression.) Beto would refuse PAC money and high-priced political consultants. He would refuse to go negative. Maybe he would be the guy to defeat one of the most divisive, least liked members of the Senate.\n\nSo, while old-line campaign operatives remained quietly pessimistic, a new, Beto-favoring concept started making the rounds: Texas isn\u2019t a red state, it is a nonvoting state. This made a lot of sense, as turnout has declined to the point where Texas ranks dead last in the country, with only 28 percent of Texans voting in the 2014 midterms. The reasons for this are many: voter suppression; gerrymandering, which made most races noncompetitive; profound voter apathy (because the races were mostly noncompetitive); and a very young electorate. The last was perhaps the most crucial: as the Texas Tribune reported, almost a third of Texas\u2019 Hispanics aren\u2019t yet old enough to vote, so they can\u2019t be blamed.\n\nThe people who do vote regularly are over 65, with the second-largest group between 45 and 64. The vast majority of them are white: Two out of three of over-65 voters are, as are about half in the 45-to-64 demographic. They are the proverbial stakeholders, with families, schools, homes and neighborhoods to maintain.\n\nPut another way, while the media has focused intensely on the Latino vote, the truth is that a Democratic candidate in Texas still needs a whole lot of white votes to win, from Republicans or from people who have never voted in the past. As the Trib put it, white Texans outnumber voters of other races in the age groups that most consistently turn out to vote.\n\nSo, the solution for any sort of Democratic return to power in Texas involves a number of factors, the most important of which might be to take a page from Karl Rove, who basically found brand-new Republican voters to get George W. Bush into the governor\u2019s office in 1994. This might not have been as hard then as turning up new Democrats today\u2014Texas then had experienced a surge of (mostly white) immigrants from Rust Belt cities to the north, who were more interested in supporting a moderate, good ol\u2018 boy (Bush) than a sassy, white-haired liberal woman (Richards).\n\nBeto is looking for new voters when he travels to those 254 counties, sure, but the trouble is that many Texas counties have very few people. As Bill Miller, a longtime Austin lobbyist puts it: \u201cBeto made a big point of going to 254 counties. There is nobody in 200 of those counties and those who do mostly vote Republican.\u201d Campaign operatives watching from the sidelines point out that the majority of voters are in the cities, which are blue, and the suburbs and exurbs, which are mostly red. Here, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s tactic has been to attract millennials\u2014assume you\u2019ve seen the video with the skateboard\u2014who have traditionally lagged in attendance at the polls. Whether they are just showing up at rallies and preaching to each other on social media but will be MIA at the voting booth remains to be seen. They haven\u2019t shown up in the past.\n\nOne reason for that, however, may be a lack of inspiring Democratic candidates. Wendy Davis, who ran against Governor Greg Abbott after filibustering for women\u2019s health in the state Senate, wound up being a very glamorous flash in the pan. Lupe Valdez, who is running against Abbott today, is getting very little traction, despite or because of the fact that she is a gay Latina sheriff. The ineffectuality of the Democrats here was demonstrated most pathetically when state Senator Carlos Uresti went to jail for helping perpetrate a Ponzi scheme, and a Republican beat his replacement in an overwhelmingly Democratic district. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d one political operative chided.\n\nWeak candidates create a perpetual downward spiral. Good candidates don\u2019t run, so the weaker ones who do inevitably lose, which then supports the conventional wisdom that a Democrat, especially a white male Democrat, can\u2019t win statewide in Texas.\n\nThe case could be made that now Texas Democrats finally have a strong candidate in O\u2019Rourke, but if he loses, it will be because he wasn\u2019t strong enough against an incumbent who radiates smarminess. Yes, Beto has broken all fundraising records; that $38 million helps, but a lot of the donors don\u2019t live here, and hence aren\u2019t voters. Those who are\u2014and those who aren\u2019t traditional liberals or further left\u2014may need more than the positive but somewhat vague message O\u2019Rourke is selling. As Miller puts it, \u201cHe\u2019s been Beto, which is his No. 1 message. He\u2019s been on fire with certain pockets of people and he has been on fire nationally, but he\u2019s not on fire in Texas.\u201d\n\nOf course, the more O\u2019Rourke defines himself\u2014pro-abortion rights, anti-wall, anti-gun, pro-immigrant and so on\u2014the more Cruz can paint him as \u201ca far-left liberal who doesn\u2019t represent Texas values.\u201d Which is exactly what he has done.\n\nA group supporting O\u2019Rourke recently countered by applying some old-line Texas jujitsu, that is, by suggesting in a commercial that Cruz isn\u2019t, as his campaign slogan claims, as \u201ctough as Texas.\u201d It stars Sonny Carl Davis reprising his quintessential Texan role in Richard Linklater\u2019s 2011 movie Bernie. He essentially calls Cruz a pussy. This quien es mas macho strategy may or may not work on November 6, but at least it\u2019s funny.\n\nO\u2019Rourke himself has finally begun to attack Cruz in commercials for his shutdown of the government, his antipathy toward health care for all, and his disrespect for Texas teachers and support of Betsy DeVos. \u201cHe\u2019s selling fear and paranoia instead of solutions,\u201d O\u2019Rourke says in another ad, criticizing Cruz\u2019s intention to deport the Dreamers. Ads like these may be what is necessary to attract the new voters he needs, though pros wish he would show less Beto and more regular Texans, including endorsements from local community leaders. \u201cA more low-key, humble thing,\u201d said one political organizer, \u201cnot school spirit on steroids.\u201d (Many who support Beto wish he would have gone on the attack much sooner. If he loses, get ready to hear this as a common refrain.)\n\nOf course, it ain\u2019t over til Election Day, and there are those who believe that despite trailing anywhere from 5 to 9 points in the polls, O\u2019Rourke may still pull it off. My colleague at Texas Monthly, R.G. Ratcliffe, wrote a column explaining why various polls could have it wrong\u2014that the numbers could be based on traditional turnout instead of taking into consideration the supposed blue wave and the Trump backlash.\n\nThe truth is, no one will know what kind of plan will put a Democrat into a major office in Texas until someone actually wins a race this century. The O\u2019Rourke plan has been to use social media, newfangled metrics, positive messages and a whole lot of charisma to distance himself from the old Democratic base while simultaneously building on it. You can\u2019t argue that he hasn\u2019t already been successful, maybe with help from an unpopular president: Texas had 14 million registered voters in 2014, but just 4.7 million people went to the polls. As of today, the number of those registered has grown by 1.6 million, 400,000 of them just since March. Early voting started on October 22, and the turnout has already hit record numbers\u2014some of the credit for that has to go to a Democratic candidate who has generated almost as much enthusiasm as Willie Nelson, who endorsed him.\n\nTexas does not register party affiliation, and we still don\u2019t know who these new voters will choose, of course. A Quinnipiac poll released on October 29 narrowed a 9-point gap in Cruz\u2019s favor back down to around 5. It also hints how things could, maybe, break O\u2019Rourke\u2019s way: Men here are going for Cruz by 56 to 39 percent, but women are going for O\u2019Rourke by 52 to 45. Cruz leads with white voters by 67 percent to 30 percent, while black voters are going for O\u2019Rourke by 86 percent to 12 percent, and Hispanics by 60 percent to 36 percent.\n\nO\u2019Rourke\u2019s canvassers have been working extra hard of late in minority communities in the cities. In Houston, there are still many unhappy folks who are still underserved after not one but two hurricanes. The 7th Congressional District, which Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, and where Lizzie Pannill Fletcher has challenged Republican stalwart John Culberson, might be an indicator. It\u2019s a C-shaped district that encompasses some poor neighborhoods as well as prosperous white suburbs like Memorial. (At the same time, her candidacy could be helped by having O\u2019Rourke higher up the ticket.) Exurbs like Kingwood to the north and Sugar Land to the south have voted reliably Republican in the past, but they are full of prosperous immigrants who might find O\u2019Rourke\u2019s positive message a lot more welcoming than that of the current administration.\n\nIf the kids vote, if the immigrants vote, if the blacks vote, along with lots and lots of angry white women and a smattering of white liberal men\u2014well, maybe. But other seasoned observers believe all those votes still add up to a 5-point loss in a state that remains dominated by mostly white Republicans who vote.

At the moment, Rodriguez is working six days a week on the latter.\n\nOn a Sunday morning, one of the slowest times of his week because most people were either asleep or at church, Rodriguez strode past brown stucco homes in a south Phoenix neighborhood, knocking on doors for 45 minutes before hitting his first bull\u2019s-eye: a voter who had requested a mail-in ballot.\n\nNicholas Romero, 18, answered the door with a glossy charcoal face mask dotted on his nose and cheeks.

One report on the 2016 election found that millennials made up 19 percent of the voting population in Arizona, while baby boomers made up 37 percent of voters, even though the state has more millennial residents.\n\nThe Pew Research Center estimated that Latinos made up 22 percent of Arizona eligible voters in 2016, but exit polls indicated 15 percent of people casting votes there were Latino. Latinos aren\u2019t shoo-ins for Democratic votes, but 61 percent of them in Arizona said they voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, while 31 percent of Latinos said in exit polls that they supported Trump.\n\nPart of the issue, the Democracy Alliance posits, is that campaigns and candidates show up for a season and then move on. By building up organizations over several years, the Democracy Alliance is hoping it can equip groups like LUCHA in Arizona and others in New Mexico, Florida and Virginia \u2014 plus one Midwestern state, Minnesota \u2014 to turn out those harder-to-reach voters in next week\u2019s midterms.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in inauthentic community-based efforts. We\u2019re not interested in building an AstroTurf operation,\u201d said Democracy Alliance executive vice president Kim Anderson. \u201cWe want to empower real people: authentic community members raising the issues that are important to them.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have argued for two years about how to respond to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. The Democracy Alliance and many of its donors took heat from others in the party after the election for helping to build up organizations that pushed the idea that focusing on women and minorities could tip elections to Democrats. One Democratic strategist at the time described the group as \u201ca social club for a handful of wealthy white donors and labor union officials to drink wine and read memos, as the Democratic Party burns down around them.\u201d\n\nSome moderate Democrats and other political observers think the party continues to overemphasize trying to pick off deep red states, rather than playing defense in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where Trump showed they were losing voters.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018new American majority\u2019 is one piece of the strategy that Democrats need to focus on, but it can only get you over the line in certain states and districts,\u201d said Lanae Erickson, vice president at the think tank Third Way, which published a sweeping report in the wake of the last election titled \u201cWhy Demography Does Not Equal Destiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd even there, you also need to persuade people who are beyond that group,\u201d Erickson said.\n\nAnderson said the Democracy Alliance is interested in how to win back Rust Belt voters too, even though most of its early efforts are focused across more diverse Southern states.\n\n\u201cThis is about doing \u2018both, and,\u2019\u201d Anderson said. \u201cHow to expand and continue to engage Americans and real people so we\u2019re not writing states and communities off the map.\u201d\n\nDonors who belong to the Democracy Alliance pay dues to the organization and pledge to give a minimum of $300,000 a year to causes from a portfolio of approved groups. LUCHA is one of them this year, as is the Native American Voters Alliance in New Mexico, which is sending paid canvassers onto the Navajo reservation daily, armed with information on which candidates will help protect the area from uranium mining. Another organization, Somos Acci\u00f3n, organizes and mobilizes voters in eastern New Mexico around bringing higher wages and better working conditions to the state\u2019s agriculture, gas and private-prison industries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just an electoral strategy, it\u2019s how do you engage people all the time?\u201d said Shekar Narasimhan, a Democracy Alliance donor and board member. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see the results in a way we haven\u2019t seen before. And you can maintain it in \u201919, you can maintain it in \u201920 \u2014 but you better be there.\u201d\n\nDemocracy Alliance officials said they will not know how much donors contribute to the groups in total until after the election, and they declined to provide an estimate.\n\nDemocracy Alliance donors have long maintained an air of secrecy, and little is known about most of them. Major Democratic donors who have been identified as members include Soros and Steyer, hedge fund magnate Donald Sussman and technology entrepreneur Tim Gill. Until recent years, the group was mostly focused on combating the conservative ideas generated by groups like The Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council.\n\n\u201cWe progressives continue to have a strong bias toward coastal donors who focus primarily on D.C.,\u201d said Raj Goyle, a former Kansas state legislator involved in the Democracy Alliance. \u201cSo, it is definitely exciting to see genuine attention to the states with serious dollars flowing and new muscle building. But decades of neglect won't be fixed overnight, even with a successful election night next week.\u201d\n\nThe race to replace Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who is retiring, is crucial for both parties\u2019 efforts to secure control of the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a narrow, one-seat majority. Sinema, a Democratic House member, is in a statistical tie with Republican Rep. Martha McSally, a former Air Force pilot.\n\nEarly voting so far appears to favor Republicans. More than a million ballots have been cast early, 42 percent of which were cast by Republicans and 33 percent by Democrats, according to the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe data says right now that that wave\u2019s not happening,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, a veteran GOP consultant in the state. \u201cSomeday. It\u2019s not going to be this cycle.\u201d\n\nGetting more low-propensity voters to participate in elections is a victory in itself, said Alejandra Gomez, co-executive director of LUCHA, a 501(c)4 organization that does not have to reveal its donors. Gomez said the group gets funding from sources including unions and dues-paying members in addition to the Democracy Alliance.\n\nEarlier this year, she said, the organization registered 190,000 voters during a get-out-the-vote drive. LUCHA focused initially on registering people to vote by going to supermarkets and gas stations in parts of Phoenix with large minority populations. Later, canvassers started going door-to-door to identify possible Democratic voters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a historic number of communities of color that have been registered to vote, that are turning out to vote. The same thing with Democratic registrants \u2014 it\u2019s at an all-time high this year,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what this year is going to bring. What we do know is that we\u2019ve already won.\u201d\n\nIn the same neighborhood where Rodriguez sat with Romero while he filled out his ballot, LUCHA canvassers Astrid Pizarro, 22, and Felix Medina, 18, helped Jaime Zamarron Rosas, 43, register to vote over the weekend. He was too late to vote Tuesday, but he said he\u2019s wanted to register but has \u201calways been very busy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Spanish while seated on a beige sectional in Rosas\u2019 living room, Medina walked him through the various boxes on the form, leading up to party preference.\n\n\u201cDo I have to mark something down?\u201d Rosas asked. \u201cWhat party is \u2018El Donald\u2019 from?\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublican,\u201d Medina replied. \u201cSo, if you support immigrants and education, then put down Democrat. If you support Donald Trump, then put down Republican.\u201d\n\nRosas ticked off a box. \u201cWhichever party is opposite Trump\u2019s,\u201d he said.\n\nJesus Rodriguez contributed to this report.", "To ease her path back to the speaker's gavel, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has raised $6.7 million for \u201cRed to Blue\u201d candidates trying to oust GOP incumbents. | J.

The minority leader has raised $6.7 million for \u201cRed to Blue\u201d candidates trying to oust GOP incumbents. She\u2019s set up phone-banking and texting operations for one California House candidate who hasn\u2019t clarified a position on her to lead the caucus. And she\u2019s sent more than 30 of her staffers out to toss-up districts \u2014including places where candidates have distanced themselves from Pelosi on the trail.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a charm offensive underway, and there\u2019s a real effort on [Pelosi\u2019s] part to reach out to these campaigns and offer help, even to those who seem to be distancing himself or flat out rejecting her,\u201d said a senior Democratic aide. \u201cThey know what the political reality is.\u201d\n\nAdded another Democratic operative working on House campaigns: \u201cShe\u2019s endearing herself to these candidates and she\u2019s building relationships with them, laying that groundwork. But her primary objective is flipping the House.\u201d\n\nPelosi's office would not comment for this story.\n\nStill, Pelosi\u2019s spadework doesn\u2019t guarantee success: A small but determined group of candidates could complicate her path to the speakership. The five candidates with solid prospects of winning on Election Day, who have confirmed to POLITICO that they would vote against her on the floor, are Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Paul Davis of Kansas, Dan McCready of North Carolina and \u2014 after publication of this story \u2014 Jason Crow of Colorado.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Marine and a Christian. I keep my word,\u201d McCready said in an interview when asked about the possibility of changing his mind and supporting Pelosi.\n\nThat pool could grow if Democrats in Republican-leaning districts win. Indeed, staff on many of these campaigns told POLITICO they worried about being attacked by Republican challengers in 2020 if the first vote they take is to vote for Pelosi after implying they would not.\n\nSome Democratic political consultants and a handful of lawmakers have encouraged candidates to break with her if it can help get them elected. While Pelosi has had to keep a low profile on the campaign trail because of her status as an election-season lightning rod, some of her more vocal critics within the party \u2014 such as Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Tim Ryan of Ohio \u2014 have been campaigning publicly with Democratic hopefuls in red-leaning districts.\n\nRepublicans have worked to tie Democratic candidates to Pelosi, running more than 260 different anti-Pelosi TV ads in 74 House districts during the final months of the campaign cycle. That\u2019s forced many candidates to mimic the \u201cLamb model\u201d: declaring flatly in an ad never to support Pelosi.\n\nBut most candidates adopting that strategy are from \u201creach\u201d districts and unlikely to win. If they do prevail, Pelosi allies\u2019 thinking goes, it would mean a big night for Democrats, and more leeway for Pelosi to muster the 218 votes she needs.\n\nMost of the party\u2019s contenders in \u201ctoss-up, \u201clean\u201d and \u201clikely\u201d Democratic districts fall into three categories on the Pelosi question: Embrace her, decline to weigh in until after the election or call vaguely for \u201cnew leadership.\u201d Multiple Democratic leadership sources \u2014 and even some of Pelosi\u2019s critics \u2014 believe she could win over candidates who have not said specifically they'll vote against her on the House floor.\n\nMultiple senior Democratic sources also noted that some candidates haven\u2019t specified what they mean by not supporting Pelosi. A vote against Pelosi in caucus \u2014 a secret-ballot election in which she would need a simple majority of Democrats to win the nomination for speaker \u2014 is one thing. A vote against her on the House floor, when she\u2019d need 218 votes and likely could afford only a small number of defections \u2014 is another thing entirely.\n\nThese sources expect some candidates who have bucked Pelosi on the campaign trail to vote against her in caucus, then back her on the floor. After the 2016 election, more than 60 Democrats voted against Pelosi behind closed doors, but only four followed up by opposing her on the floor.\n\nSome senior Democratic sources are also already discussing the possibility of trying to persuade some Pelosi opponents to skip the vote or vote present. That would give Pelosi a bigger buffer, while allowing these candidates to say they never voted for her.\n\nDemocrats such as McCready say that wouldn't fly with them. But other candidates in \u201ctoss-up,\u201d \u201clean\u201d or \u201clikely\u201d Democratic seats, who have come out against Pelosi, have not specified whether that would mean voting against her on the House floor. They include: Mikie Sherrill and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Jared Golden of Maine and Gil Cisneros of California.\n\nAides to those candidates declined to comment for this story or did not respond.\n\nVan Drew suggested recently that he\u2019s open to negotiation. While the candidate running for an open New Jersey seat said \u201cPelosi will not have my support as leader in the next session,\u201d he recently signed a letter vowing to back the candidate for speaker who promises to make certain changes to House rules.\n\nSome anti-Pelosi House Democrats believe the incoming class of lawmakers, fresh off campaigns in which they've touted themselves as change agents, would band together and oppose her. But others are skeptical that the incoming freshmen would stand up to Pelosi and throw the caucus into chaos after Democrats just won the majority.\n\nPelosi has been leader for more than a decade for a reason: She knows how to win people over, with flattery or arm-twisting. Among her current tactics is using her fundraising prowess to build chits with candidates without drawing the attention of their Republican opponents.\n\nPelosi has personally donated to more than 25 of those candidates most likely to win. And she\u2019s personally called or had her staff reach out to candidates with encouragement and praise.\n\nThe Pelosi-aligned House Majority PAC has also spent millions on ads helping these candidates in \u201clean\u201d and \u201clikely\u201d Democrat as well as \u201ctoss-up\u201d districts. Many of those candidates have embraced Pelosi outright or have called for \u201cnew leadership,\u201d but stopped short of saying they would vote against her.\n\nDemocratic hopefuls Andy Kim of New Jersey and Anthony Brindisi of New York have both called for new blood. \"It\u2019s time we have new leadership on both sides of the aisle in Washington to get the job done,\u201d Kim said this summer. Brindisi struck a similar tone, saying earlier this year: \"I believe it's time for new leadership on both sides of the aisle.\"\n\nBut both have accepted money from Pelosi\u2019s PAC. House Majority PAC spent $3.1 million to help Kim and $2.2 million to boost Brindisi.\n\nNeither candidate would say whether they'd buck Pelosi on the floor if they win and Democrats are in the majority.", "President Donald Trump's verbal attacks on female candidates aren\u2019t applied equally across the board. | Scott Olson/Getty Images White House Name-calling Trump treads lightly with some female candidates While his jabs might delight hard-core supporters, they also come with risks in states like Missouri, where there is a tight Senate race.\n\nCOLUMBIA, Mo. \u2014 He called Nancy Pelosi \u201can MS-13 lover.\u201d He deemed Maxine Waters a \u201clow-IQ person.\u201d He dubbed Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump has never been shy about branding his female political enemies with personal and demeaning insults.

While his jabs might delight hard-core supporters, they also come with risks, especially in states like Missouri, where McCaskill has served as a senator for nearly 12 years, winning over moderates and surviving as other state Democrats went extinct.\n\n\u201cThere are certain women who seem to irk him and so he raises them in all sorts of settings as representative of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a professor at Rutgers University-Camden who studies gender in politics.\n\nTrump has often responded to this historic moment with rage, launching deeply personal and sarcastic attacks on the women he sees as his enemies. During the 2016 presidential primaries, he dismissed opponent Carly Fiorina by declaring, \u201cLook at that face. Would anybody vote for that?\u201d And during the general election, he recapped a debate with Hillary Clinton by noting, \u201cWhen she walked in front of me, believe me, I wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201d\n\nSince then, he has granted nicknames to many of his female adversaries. In Trump\u2019s lexicon, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is \u201csneaky Dianne\u201d and Rep. Jacky Rosen, running for the Senate in Nevada, is \u201cWacky Jacky.\u201d On Thursday, Trump called Abrams \u201cnot qualified\u201d to be governor, adding \u201clook at her past, take a look at her history, take a look at what she wants to do and what she has in mind for the state.\u201d\n\nBut some of the women in the tightest Senate races haven\u2019t had to endure such an intense upbraiding. While New York Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is a \u201clightweight,\u201d Trump has mostly avoided memorable insults when stumping in North Dakota for Kevin Cramer, who is running against Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.\n\nOne possible explanation for the kid-glove treatment: Democrats in tight races have avoided going after Trump aggressively, a tactic that \u2014 intended or not \u2014 shields them from the hot-tempered president\u2019s wrath.\n\n\u201cThe direct attacks tend to be against the women who have been the most vocal against him,\u201d Dittmar noted.\n\nMcCaskill, for her part, has at times avoided even saying Trump\u2019s name as she is out campaigning, focusing instead on local issues and her ability to work effectively with politicians of all stripes. McCaskill even went on Fox News last week to insist she was not one of the \u201ccrazy Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe crazy Democrats are people who walk in restaurants and scream at elected officials\u2019 faces,\u201d she said.\n\nHer campaign even aired a radio ad recently that featured two men chatting.\n\n\"Claire's not one of those crazy Democrats. She works right in the middle and finds compromise,\" one man says .\n\nTrump on Thursday night argued that though McCaskill might be sane, her voting record aligns with with \u201cthe crazy Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to what Claire says,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cJust look at how she votes. She votes with the crazy Democrats and they have gotten crazier.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s critics say there\u2019s a marked difference between the way he talks about his male and female opponents.\n\n\u201cHe has one playbook for women and one for men. He attacks women on their looks, their intelligence and mental stability,\u201d said Christine Matthews, president of the public opinion research firm Bellwether, adding that his habit of attacking women is \u201ctiresome\u201d and \u201cimmature.\u201d\n\nPublicly, Republicans argue that Trump is just being Trump, asserting that his brash broadsides are what makes him appeal to so many conservatives. And they counter that he\u2019s an equal opportunity attacker, noting that he has lambasted men too.\n\nBut some GOP strategist have privately worried that the president is alienating women with his rheotric \u2014 a recent survey from PBS, NPR and Maris found that only 33 percent of women approve of Trump\u2019s job performance, compared to 46 percent of men. Young women are especially turned off by the president. A CBS News poll over the summer showed that 70 percent of women aged 18 to 35 were dissatisfied or angry about the Trump presidency.\n\nTrump brushed off such concerns Thursday night, sarcastically addressing the polling.\n\n\u201cWomen want security and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing well with women,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWomen are smart \u2014 they\u2019re smarter than the men,\u201d he added, before holding his hand up to the side of his mouth as if he were telling a secret to the crowd: \u201cBut don\u2019t say I said it.\u201d\n\nBut the numbers don\u2019t back up Trump\u2019s boasts. While Trump frequently brags about how well he did among women the 2016 election, he only received 41 percent of their vote. And Trump\u2019s remarks about women have hurt him with college-educated white women, particularly in light of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s controversial nomination fight, during which Trump mocked Christine Blasey Ford after she accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment. According to polling, 58 percent of college-educated white women believed the Senate should have rejected Kavanaugh.\n\nBut it remains unclear whether Trump\u2019s mouthy midterm roadshow will make a significant difference on the final results.\n\nThough Dittmar said Trump\u2019s antics are unlikely to shift the opinions of the already-dug-in electorate, she added that his harsh critiques can be used as a tool to fundraise and to encourage voters to show up at the polls on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it necessarily changes a lot of minds,\u201d Dittmar added. \u201cWe\u2019re three years in now and we\u2019re sort of accustomed to this. He\u2019s done and said all of these things before.\u201d", "Several hawkish GOP senators \u2013 led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R.-Tex) \u2014 expect that the president will disappoint them when he rolls out new Iran sanctions Friday. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Foreign Policy GOP hawks to Trump: You're going soft on Iran The president says he's waging a 'maximum pressure' campaign, but a group of prominent Republican senators is pushing him to overrule his Treasury secretary and punish Iranian banks.\n\nDemocrats at home and allies abroad have slammed President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Iran as recklessly dangerous. But some prominent Republicans are making the case that Trump\u2019s policy is actually too soft.\n\nThat\u2019s the argument of several hawkish GOP senators who plan to introduce legislation later this month that would force Trump to dramatically increase U.S. economic pressure towards Tehran, in what would amount to a high-stakes showdown between the Trump White House and Senate Republicans over foreign policy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTheir goal is to make Trump side with his national security adviser, John Bolton, and overrule Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who argued for a more cautious approach.\n\nLed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R.-Tex), the lawmakers \u2014 who typically cheer Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves \u2014 expect that Trump will disappoint them when he rolls out new Iran sanctions Friday. The State Department has scheduled a Friday morning call on the subject. Refusing to be associated with a policy he opposes, Bolton dropped off the call, during which Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will brief reporters, according to two sources familiar with the conversations.

He has also threatened Iran with severe \u201cconsequences\u201d if it seeks a conflict with the U.S.\n\nUnder similar Congressional pressure, the Obama administration cut off Iranian banks from SWIFT several years ago, but ended those penalties as part of the nuclear deal.\n\nBolton argued internally that the new sanctions, set to go into effect late Sunday, would only have teeth if they blocked Iranian banks from the SWIFT network. That would make it nearly impossible for those banks to conduct international business.\n\nBut Mnuchin resisted Bolton\u2019s efforts, arguing that preserving access for Iranian banks is necessary to keep humanitarian aid flowing into the country and to prevent a number of European nations, which opposed the U.S. exit from the Iranian nuclear deal, from forming an alternative network to SWIFT that could include Iran, Russia, China \u2014 and to which the U.S. would have no visibility.\n\nAs a result, the new sanctions package is not expected to include demands on SWIFT, according to four Republicans familiar with the administration\u2019s internal deliberations.\n\nAs GOP hawks demand tougher action on Iran, former Obama administration officials warned that even the non-SWIFT sanctions Trump is expected to impose on Iran\u2019s oil and gas industries could lead to war.\n\n\u201cThe Trump Administration has laid out unachievably high objectives for changes in Iran and its policies,\u201d Jarrett Blank, the former deputy lead coordinator and State Department coordinator for Iran nuclear implementation at the U.S. Department of State said in a statement released Thursday by the left-leaning group Diplomacy Works.\n\n\u201cThe outcome will at best be U.S. isolation and failure and at worst conflict with Iran,\u201d he added.\n\nSome foreign policy experts expressed distress \u2014 but not surprise \u2014 that lawmakers are making plans to take on the White House even before the administration has announced its policy.\n\n\u201cThere was a sense that those who are advocates of a more judicious approach to handling that particular dimension had won out,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the Foreign Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cI am not surprised to see there is noise from the Hill because it may in fact be intended to try to press the administration to reverse the decision even before it\u2019s announced.\u201d\n\nSome of the Cruz bill\u2019s supporters believe his legislation is intended, at least in part, to generate headlines that will draw the president\u2019s attention to the dispute among his advisers \u2014 it is not clear whether he personally signed off on the non-SWIFT sanctions or understood that a more Draconian approach was open to him \u2014 and incentivize him to overturn it. That is something the president can do by fiat at any point.\n\n\u201cI think the objective of the legislation is partly to attract his attention when his strongest supporters in the House and in the Senate are saying \u2018Mr. President, you\u2019re not being tough enough on Iranian banks,\u2019 that will attract his attention,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which has worked closely with the administration on foreign policy but supports the forthcoming bill. \u201cAnother objective is to demonstrate to SWIFT\u2019s board of directors that Congress will continue to pursue the expulsion of sanctioned banks from SWIFT as they forced SWIFT to do in 2012.\n\nThe Cruz legislation would impose mandatory sanctions on SWIFT officials if they refused to disconnect Iranian banks that were sanctioned before the JCPOA went into effect. Republican supporters of the legislation say it could pass the Senate as an attachment to the National Defense Authorization Act or any other appropriations bill if Republicans hold the upper chamber on Tuesday.\n\nIts prospects to become law are less clear if the Democrats take the House on Tuesday. Its proponents are hopeful that AIPAC, the influential pro-Israel lobbying group, will support it \u2014 and pressure pro-Israel Democrats into doing so as well. \u201cIf SWIFT provides services to sanctioned Iranian banks we believe appropriate action should be taken,\u201d an AIPAC official told POLITICO on Thursday.\n\nUnder U.S. pressure, SWIFT cut off access to Iranian banks six years ago, a move credited in part with weakening the Iranian economy and helping bring the mullahs to the table to negotiate the Obama administration\u2019s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s maximum pressure campaign will not succeed if the Islamic Republic remains connected to SWIFT,\u201d Cruz wrote in an August letter to Mnuchin that was co-signed by 15 other GOP Senators.\n\nSkeptics of the Cruz legislation say that access to SWIFT may be key to ensuring Iran continues to comply with the nuclear deal even though the U.S. has torn it up.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians were quite specific in citing SWIFT access as an absolute requirement of any nuclear deal, it was very high on their list of priorities,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cFor that reason, it looms very large on the side of the Europeans as a point of leverage they can preserve with the Iranians. If they can protect SWIFT that is going to try to help them persuade the Iranians to sit tight and abide by their obligations under the nuclear deal even as the United States is not.\u201d", "Restating his vow to deploy thousands more troops to the southwest border, President Donald Trump fumed over border-crossers and said he had instructed U.S. military personnel to \u201cconsider it a rifle\u201d if incoming migrants hurl stones at them. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images White House Trump's immigration obsession could backfire, some Republicans fear Ignoring pleas for a closing focus on the economy, Trump embraces a fiery finale that has distressed vulnerable GOP candidates.\n\nPresident Donald Trump hammered his hard line on immigration again on Thursday, but some Republicans wish he would shift focus to the economy, lest he drive away suburban voters and mobilize Latino communities against the GOP.\n\nSeveral Republican operatives and officials described a growing sense of fear within the party over Trump\u2019s hard-line rhetoric on border security, which he has repeated nearly every day for the past three weeks.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re playing at the margins with Republicans on the issue of immigration, but there are very many more Democrats that might be mobilized by his rhetoric,\u201d said conservative radio host and The Resurgent editor Erick Erickson, who called Trump\u2019s immigration-heavy closing pitch \u201cnot smart politically\u201d in a tweet earlier Thursday.\n\nOperating under the assumption that talking tough on immigration can energize enough Republicans to stymie a \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democratic midterm voters, Trump has spent the past week unveiling restrictive immigration policies at a dizzying pace and making erroneous declarations about a caravan of Central American migrants.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Republicans everywhere should denounce it,\u201d tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent Trump critic.\n\nFlake is retiring, but congressional Republicans battling for political survival in swing districts with large clusters of college-educated voters and women have grown increasingly worried that such groups are having trouble stomaching what Trump is dishing up.\n\n\u201cThe kind of voters Trump is talking to right now, there aren\u2019t enough of them in these areas to get us over the finish line,\u201d said one GOP campaign official.\n\n\u201cWe understand this is an issue that motivates his base, but the economic issues are what we really need to win these swing voters because they are who\u2019s going to decide who controls the House,\u201d the official told POLITICO, adding that Trump \u201cis solidifying swing voters who were already leaning Democratic and are now definitely going vote for Democratic candidates.\u201d\n\nTop Republican leaders have long urged Trump to make better use his rallies by highlighting the strong economy and reminding voters of the extra cash in their pockets from last year\u2019s GOP tax cuts. As opposed to stoking fear over an \u201cimmigration crisis\u201d, they want him to boast about the unemployment rate slipping below 4 percent, middle-class incomes returning to pre-recession levels, and surging consumer confidence.\n\nConcerns about the president re-focusing attention on illegal immigration have reached a fever pitch in districts with large numbers of Latino eligible voters, who\u2019ve become exceedingly angry at the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just not enough base voters in a place like Miami to hand Carlos Curbelo a win,\u201d said one Republican operative, pointing to a recent New York Times poll showing Curbelo, the GOP incumbent, trailing his Democratic opponent by a single percentage point in Florida\u2019s 26th congressional district, which is nearly 70 percent Latino.\n\nSome Republicans retiring from districts won by Hillary Clinton have also expressed dismay at the president\u2019s decidedly anti-illegal immigrant closing argument.\n\n\u201cThe bloc of competitive [Republican-held] districts less impacted by POTUS thus far are those with high # of immigrants. So now POTUS, out of nowhere, brings birthright citizenship up. Besides being basic tenet of America, it\u2019s political malpractice,\u201d said retiring GOP Rep.

Public opinion polls on the House have moved away from Republicans in the last two weeks and if you look at where that\u2019s coming from, it\u2019s the president\u2019s hard-line rhetoric.\u201d\n\nNo generic ballot poll has directly linked the president\u2019s immigration talk to a pro-Democratic voter shift. But recent studies have shown that Americans see immigration as among the nation\u2019s most divisive issue, in addition to it being a policy area Trump has mishandled, according to voters in some states with key midterm races.\n\nAn MPR News/Star Tribune poll taken last month in Minnesota, where both Senate seats are up for grabs and Republicans are competing for the governor\u2019s mansion, found that 52 percent of likely voters disapprove of the president\u2019s direction on immigration, versus 42 percent who approve.\n\nTrump may also be betting too much on the all-around importance of immigration to voters who are not already a part of his base.\n\n\u201cThere is a large partisan intensity gap on immigration, with Republicans and supporters of President Donald Trump assigning much higher priority to the issue than Democrats and Hillary Clinton voters,\u201d wrote Republican pollster and strategist Patrick Ruffini in an October report about Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the issue.\n\nStill, the president clearly believes he has a winning formula on his hands.\n\n\u201cOnce they arrive, the Democrat Party\u2019s vision is to offer them free health care, free welfare, free education and even the right to vote,\u201d Trump said Thursday of the caravan of migrants, many of whom are fleeing gang violence and extreme poverty in their own home countries.\n\n\u201cYou and the hardworking taxpayers of our country will be asked to pick up the entire tab,\u201d he warned.\n\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the title of Erickson's publication.", "", "Exit pollsters this year are adjusting the way they ask voters about their educational attainment to better conform to Census data, and then adjusting their samples. | John Minchillo/AP Photo Elections Exit pollsters make changes after 2016 breakdown\n\nThe much-beleaguered and always-in-demand election-night exit polls are getting a makeover for 2018.\n\nIn a joint statement issued Thursday, a consortium of four news networks at the company that conducts the exit polls, Edison Research, announced changes meant to make this year\u2019s surveys more accurate after 2016, when early results suggested Hillary Clinton was more likely to win the presidential election than Donald Trump \u2014 yet another example of the exit poll\u2019s overestimating Democrats\u2019 performance in the vote count.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe changes are designed to better account for the sharp cleavages in the electorate along educational lines, especially among white voters, and the continually increasing share of the vote that is cast prior to Election Day in states that allow early or no-excuse absentee voting.\n\nBut they also come as two outlets have already defected from the National Election Pool: The Associated Press and Fox News, which are conducting their own version of an exit poll. It ended the pool\u2019s decades-long monopoly on the exit poll, and for the first time since 1988, there will be two separate surveys of voters on Election Day.\n\nThe announcement Thursday from Edison Research and the surviving members of the National Election Pool \u2014 ABC News, CBS News, CNN and NBC News \u2014 said the exit poll would still, fundamentally, be conducted using the \u201cmethodology that has provided reliable estimates and served journalists and scholars for more than a generation.\u201d But there are some key tweaks being made.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

In many states that have robust early voting \u2014 on this year\u2019s Senate map, that includes Florida, Nevada and Tennessee \u2014 a majority of the votes are expected to be cast prior to Election Day. That means simply surveying voters who leave the polling place on Election Day is no longer sufficient to measure the electorate.\n\nExit pollsters have, for the past few elections, used telephone calls to survey early voters. But for the first time this year, the exit poll is already underway: Edison Research has positioned in-person interviewers outside large early-voting centers in some states to capture voters as they leave.\n\nThe other changes are wonkier, but just as significant. Educational attainment has become a key predictor of a voter\u2019s behavior in the Trump era, especially among whites. White voters without a college degree have flocked toward Republicans in recent elections \u2014 and supported Trump in even larger numbers. White voters with a college degree, meanwhile, have become markedly more Democratic.\n\nThere\u2019s strong evidence that the trend will continue in 2018. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released Thursday showed Democrats leading the generic congressional ballot by 9 percentage points among white voters with a college degree, while Republicans have a yawning, 33-point advantage among white voters without a degree \u2014 a 42-point education gap in this year\u2019s midterms.\n\n\u201cThe results of the exit poll in 2016 demonstrated that knowing a voter\u2019s educational background is critical to understanding American politics today,\u201d the National Election Pool said in its statement.\n\nTypically, the exit poll overestimates the more-educated share of the electorate. But this year, exit pollsters are adjusting the way they ask voters about their educational attainment to better conform to census data, and then adjusting their samples \u2014 which they hadn\u2019t done in the past \u2014 to better reflect the true electorate by education and age.\n\n\u201cWhile this adjustment does not meaningfully change the results of the Exit Poll in terms of the voting behavior of various subgroups,\u201d the statement said, \u201cit does serve to adjust the poll\u2019s estimates of the age and education makeup of the day\u2019s voters in a way that is a best practice for polling in today\u2019s environment.\u201d\n\nThe changes come at a perilous time for the National Election Pool and its exit-polling operation. The four networks still in the pool are committed for 2018 and 2020. And as part of the agreement, those networks are getting both exit-poll data and the actual election results from Edison Research, abandoning a roughly 15-year partnership with The Associated Press.\n\nThe AP and Fox News, meanwhile, are preparing for the public debut of their joint project, which The AP is calling \u201cVoteCast.\u201d It\u2019s not a true exit poll: Voters are interviewed via phone calls and web surveys, rather than at the polling place. The two news outlets are partnering with NORC at the University of Chicago on the project.\n\nTheir plans were officially unveiled back in May. Arnon Mishkin, a consultant on Fox News\u2019 decision desk, delivered a presentation at a pollsters\u2019 convention that month, explaining why Fox had left the network consortium. Mishkin cited a \u201cpro-Democratic skew\u201d in the results of the traditional exit poll going back decades.\n\n\u201cThis is a longstanding problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been exacerbated to a certain extent in recent years, but it\u2019s been around forever. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve collectively addressed.\u201d", "President Donald Trump has been leaning heavily into immigration and nationalism just days before the election. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo Media As Trump fumed about immigration, some media outlets cut away\n\nPresident Donald Trump, normally accustomed to wall-to-wall coverage, lost television audiences on Thursday as he made fiery remarks on immigration and the nation\u2019s asylum system that deviated from what was expected to be a meaningful policy speech.\n\nThe resistance came from at least two networks that have previously been targets of the president\u2019s anti-media rhetoric: CNN and MSNBC.

And while doing so, he has played fast and loose with the truth, for instance claiming without evidence that Middle Eastern terrorists could be among the migrants moving through Mexico in hopes of reaching the United States to claim asylum.\n\nCiting his record of untruths, MSNBC chose not to carry Trump\u2019s remarks at all.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s used immigration in blatantly political ways, and in an abundance of caution, we\u2019ve decided to monitor those remarks, fact-check them against his rhetoric and record on immigration, and bring you the important news from them,\u201d Nicolle Wallace, the host of \u201cDeadline White House,\u201d told viewers as Trump spoke.\n\nThe president\u2019s favorite network, Fox News, carried the remarks and a subsequent exchange with reporters in their entirety. A spokesperson from Fox did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether producers debated switching the president off.\n\nMichael Barbaro, host of the New York Times podcast \u201cThe Daily,\u201d also announced that his show would be \u201cplaying down\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cThey are clearly not policy remarks or policy announcements,\u201d tweeted Barbaro, whose podcast reaches millions of listeners monthly. \u201cThey are deliberate attempts to inflame the electorate before the midterms.

Michael Bennet (D-Colo.). \u201cThese are not easy jobs people have from these purple and red states.\u201d\n\nThe five senators are taking desperate measures to emphasize their moderate virtues as Republicans call them Trump-hating liberals. Donnelly is expressing openness to limiting birthright citizenship for immigrants and touting his support for President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall. Manchin is playing up his battles with Senate liberals and declaring \u201cboth sides are guilty\u201d of uncompromising politics.\n\nAnd McCaskill has amped up her border security rhetoric to line up with Trump.

They hope Trump\u2019s final-week sprint through states with close Senate races will put several Republican challengers over the top.\n\nBut there are pockets of apprehension. Polls have shown Heitkamp trailing by a wide margin in North Dakota. But Trump is skipping the state this week, reflecting fears among some Republicans of overconfidence.\n\nHeitkamp\u2019s opponent, Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), is \u201cnow worried about complacency from some of the polls. That\u2019s really not helpful to him,\u201d said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.).\n\nThe five red-state Democrats have already shown they know how to traverse unforgiving political terrain. All of them won in 2012 in states Mitt Romney carried. Tester and McCaskill won in 2006, too, part of a wave of Democrats elected as a check on President George W. Bush.\n\nThe question at the heart of their campaigns this time is whether the five adequately reflect the conservative makeup of their states. They call themselves independents and point to votes where they broke ranks with Schumer and caucus liberals. Republicans say anything but full cooperation with Trump doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nDonnelly boasts about the number of his bills Trump has signed, often mentions his support for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and touts voting with Trump more than 50 percent of the time. To his opponent, Republican Mike Braun, though, none of that matters.\n\n\"On the important stuff, he's been with Schumer,\u201d Braun said in a recent interview.\n\nManchin is the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, occasionally even tilting to the right of a pair of high-profile moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. A solid favorite in his race, the anti-abortion Democrat says of liberals: \u201cI look at things very different than they do.\u201d\n\nBut his opponent, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, argues that Manchin\u2019s profile is still at odds with a state that Trump won by 42 points. \u201cA conservative fighter who\u2019s going to help President Trump versus a dishonest Washington liberal,\u201d is how Morrisey sums up the race.\n\nIn Missouri, Republican Josh Hawley called McCaskill a \u201cliberal Democrat\u201d at least 10 times during their final debate. In response, she highlights her votes that align with Trump\u2019s positions, and her willingness to work with him.\n\n\u201cJosh Hawley has decided in this campaign that he is going to win or lose by being 100 percent, never wavering from President Trump,\u201d McCaskill said. By contrast, she added, if \u201cI agree with the president, great. If not, I\u2019m not afraid\u201d to oppose him.\n\nFor Schumer to ever rise to majority leader, he needs McCaskill's strategy to resonate with voters in states that Democrats barely contest in presidential elections.

He announced the move without consulting NATO allies, many of whom helped secure the treaty three decades ago and will be threatened by its demise. And like much of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, the withdrawal offered a short-term fix to a long-term problem that ultimately will leave everyone, not least the United States, worse off.\n\nTrump cited two reasons for his decision Saturday to pull the United States out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the historic agreement Ronald Reagan struck with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Russia had violated the treaty by testing and later deploying a ground-launched cruise missile that falls within the 500-5,500km range banned by the treaty. And China, which has deployed a large arsenal of midrange missiles, is not a party to the agreement.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBoth concerns have merit. The Obama administration accused Russia of violating the INF Treaty in 2014 and sought without success to resolve the issue. And as the strategic competition with China heats up, Beijing\u2019s growing arsenal of ground-based cruise missiles increasingly threatens U.S. naval forces in the Pacific region.\n\nA strong response to these developments is warranted. But pulling out of the INF Treaty simply rewards Russia for cheating without increasing the prospects that Beijing will agree to limit its missile buildup. Once the treaty is dead, Moscow will be free to develop and deploy medium-range missiles without any constraint, threatening U.S. allies throughout Europe, the Middle East and Asia. But Russian missiles targeted east and west can also be targeted south at China, likely leading Beijing to respond with more missiles of its own.\n\nOf course, the United States would also be free to respond in kind. But it can already counter the threat of Russian medium-range missiles by deploying additional air- and sea-based missiles, which are not prohibited by the INF Treaty. New ground-based missiles would take nearly a decade to develop, and geography dictates that they would have to be deployed on the territory of allied nations in Europe and Asia.\n\nYet, it\u2019s hard to see any ally willing to accede to such a request. When NATO decided to deploy INF missiles in Europe back in the early 1980s, large-scale protests erupted. They were quieted only when the Reagan administration committed to negotiating a treaty banning all INF missiles. Trump\u2019s decision reverses that logic\u2014rather than deploying missiles as an incentive to reach an arms control agreement, it is withdrawing from an arms control agreement so it can deploy new missiles. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to develop those weapons,\u201d Trump said in announcing his decision. \u201cIf Russia is doing it and if China is doing it, and we\u2019re adhering to the agreement, that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d But if allies won\u2019t agree to deploy them, the new missiles won\u2019t have much, if any, value as bargaining chips to extract Russian and Chinese concessions.\n\nWorse, Trump decided to withdraw from the INF agreement without consulting NATO or other allied countries, even though the decision affects their core security interests. Instead, U.S. officials briefed allies on the decision only after they first visited Moscow to explain Washington\u2019s new course. Coming after Trump\u2019s repeated bashing of NATO for failing to spend more on defense, and his open questioning of America\u2019s commitment to NATO members, this latest decision further weakens an already frayed alliance.\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to walk away from the INF Treaty is hardly surprising. It\u2019s the latest in a long list of diplomatic moves he has taken without thinking through the consequences and developing a strategy that anticipates them.\n\nConsider Trump\u2019s decision to leave the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This 12-nation agreement would have encouraged trade among nations representing some 40 percent of the global economy and provided an economic and diplomatic counterweight to a rising China. The U.S. departure instead gave Beijing an opening to push its preferred trade policies, the same policies the Trump administration is now belatedly trying to counter with a trade war whose consequences will ripple across the global economy.\n\nOr take the Iran nuclear deal. Trump dismissed efforts by Britain, France and Germany to address his concerns about the agreement. He then withdrew from the deal without a clear road map for how to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear program and regional behavior. Rather than uniting the world against Tehran, the withdrawal has united much of the world against Washington.\n\nThe president has repeated the same shortsightedness on a range of other issues. Trump exited the Paris agreement on climate change without suggesting what a better deal would look like or an alternative for addressing this growing global threat. He moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem without considering how it would deepen divisions between Israelis and Palestinians. He embraced the Saudi crown prince without considering what it meant to give him a free reign to blockade Qatar, kidnap Lebanon\u2019s prime minister, wage an indiscriminate war against Yemen or murder a dissident on foreign soil.\n\nThe president insists that his willingness to upend the diplomatic chessboard means big wins for America. But it\u2019s doing nothing of the sort. Rather than solving problems, he is creating new and tougher challenges. The long-term consequences of this disruption unmoored from strategy will be a more dangerous world for the United States\u2014one it will increasingly have to face with fewer friends and allies at its side.\n\nIvo Daalder is president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\n\nJames Lindsay is senior vice president at the Council of Foreign Relations.

Brownstein Hyatt\u2019s memo helpfully breaks down the potential turnover on each committee due to retirements and possible losses, giving a sense of the scale of the changes that could occur on certain committees.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Take the House Financial Services Committee, for instance. Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) is retiring. So are Reps. Dennis Ross (R-Fla.), Ed Royce (R-Calif.), Dave Trott (R-Mich.) and Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.). Five members of the committee aren\u2019t coming back after choosing to run for other offices: Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.), who ran for Senate but lost in the primary; Rep. Steve Pearce (R-N.M.), who\u2019s running for governor; Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), who\u2019s running for Senate; Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who\u2019s running for state attorney general; and Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who\u2019s running a long-shot campaign for president. And Reps. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) and Mike Capuano (D-Mass.) lost their primaries. That\u2019s a dozen members who are definitely gone.\n\n\u2014 Now take into account the committee members who might be defeated next week. Rep. Keith Rothfus (R-Pa.) is the most endangered, according to the Cook Political Report. He\u2019s running against Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb due to redistricting, and the race is rated likely Democratic. Another seven members are in races that are rated toss-ups: Reps. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.), Mia Love (R-Utah), Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), Bruce Poliquin (R-Maine) and Claudia Tenney (R-N.Y.). If all of them lose next week \u2014 which isn\u2019t outside the realm of possibility \u2014 a third of the committee\u2019s 60 members would be gone. Other committee members could be in trouble, too: Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), whose race is rated \u201cLean Republican,\u201d and Reps. French Hill (R-Ark.), Pete King (R-N.Y.), Scott Tipton (R-Colo.) and Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), whose races are rated \u201cLikely Republican.\u201d Just one Democrat is considered at risk: Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), whose race is rated \u201cLikely Democratic.\u201d\n\n\u2014 K&L Gates takes a different approach in its memo, outlining what might happen in both chambers depending on which party controls them. If Democrats win back the House, they\u2019ve \u201cindicated they want to quickly pursue an ethics and campaign finance reform package should they assume control of the House,\u201d the firm writes. \u201cAmong the other items that may be on their legislative agenda are an infrastructure package, lowering the price of prescription drugs, protecting participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program (an upcoming court ruling on DACA will likely force action on this issue, regardless of which party controls the House), working to preserve and protect the Affordable Care Act (ACA), gun control, and protecting voting rights, among other items.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cHouse Democrats will also move quickly to pursue a wide-ranging oversight agenda focused on hearings and investigations into the Trump administration. The impact of these investigations on government agencies could be paralyzing, with many agencies understaffed to reply to the requests for documentation and testimony.\u201d The memo also delves into what might happen in different issue areas, such as the environment, financial services, health care, taxes and trade.\n\n\u2014 Here\u2019s Brownstein Hyatt\u2019s full memo.

Rather than fighting them off, the Chamber slashed its primary-season expenditures this cycle, spending just $3.6 million on political communications for its preferred candidates, compared to $11 million and $14 million in 2014 and 2016 respectively, according to federal election data.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Scott Reed, the Chamber\u2019s senior political strategist, \u201csaid his group identified fewer primaries in 2018 that pitted moderates against less business-friendly conservatives, and the group felt its cash was not as critical in those races. It instead shifted spending to support vulnerable Republican incumbents, he said. 'It\u2019s not a normal year,' Reed said in an interview. 'There weren\u2019t a lot of primaries where there was a real, fundamental difference between the candidates, so we took a different approach.\u2019\u201d Full story.\n\nYour 2018 Midterms HQ: The countdown is on.

An affiliate of Senate Leadership Fund dumped $15.5 million into Arizona during that time, the memo says, while Democratic equivalents Senate Majority PAC and Majority Forward spent a combined $6.4 million.\n\nIn Missouri, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill spent $11.9 million, far more than Republican Josh Hawley\u2019s $4.3 million.

The district went for Obama in 2012, though Trump carried it by 15 points in 2016. But the race is turning into a showcase for how that economic argument alone may not be enough to prevail among voters, even in swing districts.\n\nAfter running neck-and-neck with his Democratic challenger for months, incumbent Mike Bost began to pull ahead after the divisive September Senate hearings to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\n\nThere\u2019s a disconnect between the negative effect of Trump\u2019s policies on his voters in farm country and their unwavering support for him. That could limit the size of the Democratic majority widely expected to take control of the House next year and give Trump cover to prolong his aggressive moves against U.S. trading partners.\n\nThough soybean prices have plunged 20 percent and farm incomes are down 50 percent over the past five years, farmers who plan to vote for Bost say they still have faith their economic pain will be short-lived.

On trade, Kelly pinned the blame for the current instability on Republicans, who he said used \u201ca shotgun approach when we needed sniper.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be ups and downs in terms of trade, but right now we have no real clear plan in terms of how we\u2019re handling it,\u201d he told POLITICO.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201810/2318/1155968404_5855565189001_5855569952001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nThe Illinois Farm Bureau has also recently endorsed Bost, as have a group of trustees representing each county farm bureau.\n\n\u201cThe question is, do the farmers believe that they\u2019ve been hurt, and are they angry enough about the dramatic decline in prices that they blame the president and blame his surrogates like Mike Bost?\u201d said John Jackson, a political scientist who has been with Southern Illinois University in Carbondale in the southern part of the district since 1969.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m skeptical,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhether they vote against themselves based on the long-term belief that they\u2019re going to be alright remains to be seen.\u201d\n\nAt a national level, the Trump administration has largely sought to skate over agriculture\u2019s woes from the trade war to instead celebrate wins in industries like steel and aluminum, which have begun to rehire hundreds of workers as demand for American steel rises. Trump illustrated as much during a recent visit to Carbondale, Ill., a rural part of the district, to rally support for Bost, where he spoke at length about the steel industry while scarcely even saying the word farmer.\n\n\u201cThis is steel country,\u201d he said, and then paused. \u201cAnd lots of other country.\u201d\n\nFor Bost, the strategy has been to keep in constant touch with worried farmers and remind them that the end goal is more access to markets than they\u2019ve had before. His work with the administration on steel and as co-chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus has also allowed him frequent contact with the president, to whom he says he\u2019s brought a simple but urgent message from his farmers.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t allow this to last too long.\u201d\n\nWhile campaigning for Rep.

Down to the point where farmers are tightening their belts, holding back on major equipment purchases, sometimes retiring early. Down for the foreseeable future, but for what seems like frustratingly little in return.\n\n\u201cMost of our customers get what I think Trump is trying to do,\u201d said Rob Stookey, a manager at Mascoutah Equipment who sells tractors, combines and other machinery to farmers grappling with how to manage higher costs amid lower profits. \u201cBut at what cost? And how long is it going to last? That\u2019s the big question that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind.\u201d\n\nIn rural towns like these, where the farm economy dominates the local economy, it\u2019s more than just farmers themselves taking a hit. A recent Iowa State University study found that current trade disruptions could lead to an estimated income loss of up to $2.2 billion for four major sectors of the agricultural economy, which would in turn reduce labor income in the broader state economy by another $484 million \u2014 enough to support roughly 12,300 jobs.\n\n\u201cIt does have an economic impact,\u201d said Adam Nielsen, the director of national legislation and policy development at the Illinois Farm Bureau. \"When agriculture is doing well, rural communities seem to be doing better.

He slammed socialist leaders in three countries \u2014 Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua \u2014 as the \u201ctroika of tyranny.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBolsonaro is a legislator whose presidential campaign was punctuated by openly racist, sexist and homophobic comments he made \u2014 for instance, saying he would rather his son die than be gay. President Donald Trump also previously congratulated Bolsonaro on his election.\n\nBolton grouped Bolsonaro\u2019s election with that of Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque, a rightist politician who has not been embroiled in similar controversies.\n\n\u201cThe recent elections of like-minded leaders in key countries, including Iv\u00e1n Duque in Colombia and, last weekend, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, are positive signs for the future of the region, and demonstrate a growing regional commitment to free-market principles, and open, transparent and accountable governance,\u201d Bolton said at Freedom Tower in Miami, a national historic landmark that served as a processing center for Cuban refugees in the 1960s.\n\nLatin America was a major staging ground for the Cold War, leading to U.S. policies such as the one that allowed Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro\u2019s rule to resettle stateside.

Bolton also announced a fresh round of sanctions against Venezuela, which will prevent Americans from doing business with corrupt actors in the the country\u2019s gold sector.\n\n\u201cAs the president has said, the problems we see in Latin America today have not emerged because socialism has been implemented poorly,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cOn the contrary, the Cuban, Venezuelan and Nicaraguan people suffer in misery because socialism has been implemented effectively.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Bolsonaro, who has called immigrants \u201cscum,\u201d will be willing to help Venezuelan refugees arriving at the border with Brazil. In August, residents of a Brazilian border town drove Venezuelans out with attacks that included beatings and arson.\n\nBolton\u2019s speech was reminiscent of his time in the George W. Bush White House, when, as the United Nations ambassador, he made a name for himself as a foreign policy hawk. He previously named Cuba as part of the \u201cbeyond\u201d axis of evil for opposing the U.S. fight against terrorism after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has unraveled the rapprochement with Cuba that former President Barack Obama had sought, imposing travel restrictions and pulling out diplomatic staff from the U.S. Embassy following mysterious sonic attacks.\n\nBolton also railed against his boss\u2019s predecessor by name, saying that no member of the Trump administration would ever pose in front of an image of Che Guevara, the right-hand man to Castro. Obama came under scrutiny during his visit to Cuba in 2016, when he was seen at a ceremony in Havana\u2019s Revolution Square against the backdrop of the Cuban Ministry of Interior building, which has a mural of Guevara\u2019s likeness.\n\nIn Miami, Bolton\u2019s message resonated. The influx of Latin Americans fleeing leftist dictatorships has made the city a stronghold of anti-communist fervor and support for Republicans. Flanking Bolton was Rep.

Prominent Democrats have taken whatever opportunities available to them given their limited legislative power, whether through viral moments in Senate hearings, attention-grabbing tweets, or campaign-trail cameos for vulnerable allies in swing states. But a quieter campaign has been happening largely in the shadows\u2014a battle for the hearts and minds of both the policy mavens who set the parameters of conventional wisdom on the left, and an activated Democratic base hungry to see those parameters expand. Call it the wonk primary.\n\nIt looks something like this: Most of the big-name Senate Democrats rumored to be eyeing 2020 presidential bids\u2014among them Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders\u2014have introduced at least one bold, progressive policy initiative as a legislative proposal over the past year. Their efforts are doomed to failure under a Republican-controlled Congress, but the initiatives are useful in shoring up that base\u2019s morale, and, perhaps more important, planting a flag in what\u2019s likely to be a crowded Democratic field.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a race to the great idea,\u201d said Ann O\u2019Leary, lawyer and former policy adviser to the 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign. \u201cWho\u2019s going to adopt what first, between guaranteed jobs, bold cash ideas and other policies \u2026 they\u2019re recognizing, \u2018OK, the election starts the day after the midterms,\u2019 so you put a marker down the month before and really hook on.\u201d\n\nTop Democrats have drawn on progressive pipe dreams both new and old such as universal basic income and single-payer health care, as well as more relatively modest, proven initiatives like Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s Postal Banking Act, which would allow the U.S. Postal Service to establish basic checking and savings accounts and offer small-dollar loans, effectively putting payday lenders out of business. Harris\u2019 LIFT the Middle Class Act would give a basic monthly income to Americans within a certain income bracket, an idea in vogue in Silicon Valley and pushed heavily in its universal form by ex-Facebooker Chris Hughes\u2019 Economic Security Project. From a policy standpoint, the mood on the left is freewheeling, collaborative and ambitious\u2014the product of a nothing-to-lose Democratic Party at its lowest ebb of power since the 1920s.\n\nThe 2016 primary was a bitter two-person contest, in which the policy was decidedly secondary to the clash of ideologies between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, whose finely tuned policy apparatus was overshadowed by the Vermont senator\u2019s characterization of her as an establishment hack beholden to corporate dollars, and in turn how Clinton painted her opponent as an impractical dreamer.\n\nThe next Democratic primary will be different. The 2020 contenders, however many they number, all know they want to remedy wealth inequality, and they know they want to \u201cresist\u201d Trump by whatever means necessary. The combination could lead to the Democrats\u2019 most ambitious slate of legislation since the New Deal\u2014and the competition to attach one\u2019s name to FDR-style progressivism is already well underway.\n\n\n\n***\n\nThe 2016 primary birthed what was perhaps a surprising result given its bitterness\u2014a fledgling new consensus on the left. Ideas that had once been the domain of the activist fringe, like a national $15 minimum wage or tuition-free college, now took pride of place in the party\u2019s platform. In 2018, that has emboldened Democrats to promise voters a more robust program of economic reforms heading into both the midterms and eventual presidential election.\n\nToday, boutique research groups on the progressive end of the policy spectrum, like the Roosevelt Institute, are gaining new influence amid the explosion of interest in worker-friendly economic ideas. \u201cIt\u2019s not one or two representatives or senators, it\u2019s people all across the spectrum, from center-left to far left,\u201d said Nell Abernathy, the Roosevelt Institute\u2019s VP of research and policy.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 leftward lurch is simply following their voters, who despite emerging from the 2007-08 recession were left behind in many ways by the recovery, liberal strategists say.\n\n\u201cWe knew the middle class, while they were more stable, had not improved their lot\u2014the cost of being in the middle class was worse than ever, housing prices were rising, college costs, child care,\u201d said O\u2019Leary of her experience with Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cBernie Sanders really captured something that was part of that problem with the cost of college, and that got to the hearts of a bunch of voters.\u201d\n\nNow, Sanders\u2019 blue-sky policy thinking has infused the Democratic Party\u2014long dominated by veterans of the Bill Clinton administration better known for shrinking welfare rolls than expanding them\u2014with a newfound economic progressivism. Bills like Harris\u2019 LIFT (Livable Incomes for Families Today) Act, with its direct monthly cash infusion, or Booker\u2019s American Opportunity Accounts Act, which would establish \u201cbaby bonds\u201d for all American children that would be funded by the government every year before maturing at age 18, would have been unthinkable under the previous status quo. Warren\u2019s ambitious housing plan would, in a similar manner, provide direct financial assistance to first-time homebuyers in areas that were previously redlined, or segregated by race.\n\nSanders, in his typically bold fashion, has prioritized what might be the biggest rallying point in Democratic politics that doesn\u2019t come with a long red tie and fake tan: The ongoing fight to improve America\u2019s health care. Sanders, who has criticized former President Barack Obama for not going far enough in increasing access to care, wasted little time in the Trump era before introducing his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill in September 2017. In doing so, he staked a claim as the leading champion of one of the Democratic base\u2019s most passionate causes.\n\nSanders also may be helping himself with a constituency he struggled with in 2016: African-Americans. \u201cWhen you start to look at who is more likely to have medical debt in collections, it\u2019s African-Americans and also the young\u2014the share of millennials and Generation X with medical debt is actually greater than the silent generation and baby boomers,\u201d said Signe-Mary McKernan, economist and co-director of the Opportunity and Ownership Initiative at the Urban Institute.\n\nWarren, Sanders\u2019 main progressive rival, has recently taken a swing at another cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of the left: a crisis of affordable housing that\u2019s left many Americans spending nearly half their monthly income on rent. Warren\u2019s American Housing and Mobility Act takes a two-pronged approach, using subsidies and regulatory changes to increase the supply of affordable housing while subsidizing down payments for new homebuyers.\n\nHarris and Booker\u2019s signature policy efforts have been less of a bank shot: They aim to put money directly in people\u2019s wallets. Booker\u2019s program would give children a $1,000 savings account at birth, which would then be boosted each year by an amount determined by their family\u2019s income (the lower-income the household, the larger the deposits). When the fund matures, that child would then be free to use it for life costs like college tuition or a down payment for a home.\n\nAccording to a Booker aide, it was developed closely with Sandy Darity and Darrick Hamilton, economists who have been developing similar ideas for \u201cbaby bonds\u201d for the better part of the past decade. (Darity and Hamilton were also consulted in the development of Harris\u2019 LIFT program, and have done extensive work on the jobs guarantee programs in vogue with many Democrats, highlighting their position as in-demand policy tribunes on the left.)\n\nHamilton described Democrats\u2019 growing interest in such policies as a reflection of the base\u2019s desire for bolder economic action. \u201cSandy and I have been talking about this for well over a decade,\u201d Hamilton said of the \u201cbaby bonds\u201d plan. \u201cWhen you talk about the appetite to consider these policies, we go in a little bit wary to make sure [politicians are] serious and not wasting our time, or worse, are going to take the policy and turn it into something it wasn\u2019t intended to be. The Booker team \u2026 it was clear to me they were serious.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 program would provide even more direct cash assistance, providing families with up to $500 per month and individuals with up to $250 per month through a tax program that would essentially invert the unpopular Trump tax cuts. The program excludes the poor with no income, which may hurt its popularity with critics on the left, but The Atlantic reported the calculation of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (who were consulted during the development of the bill, according to a Harris aide) that it would lift 9 million Americans out of poverty, making it an undeniably powerful tool were it to be enacted.\n\nThe LIFT Act resembles in many ways with its overall effect the Earned Income Tax Credit, the benefit to working taxpayers that enjoys bipartisan popularity and which Democrats see as ripe for expansion, including Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Congressman Ro Khanna of California, who introduced legislation last year that would do so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen an issue take off so quickly to get to a place where it\u2019s already poised to be one of the big ideas in the 2020 race, and certainly in the 2020 Democratic primary,\u201d said Adam Ruben of the Economic Security Project, who has already consulted with Harris, Brown and Khanna\u2019s congressional policy teams.\n\nAnn O\u2019Leary described Harris\u2019 plan as exactly the kind of bold idea that could help with what might be the most important part of the 2020 primary\u2014finding a way to steer the national conversation, instead of having it dictated by the president. Citing Trump\u2019s recent announcement of his mysterious new tax cuts, O\u2019Leary said, \u201cShe got him to pay attention, and he didn\u2019t say \u2018You\u2019re a crazy spending lefty.\u2019 He said, \u2018You\u2019re right, and I\u2019m gonna do it better.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nOf course, Trump\u2019s attention can be a currency in its own right among top Democrats, regardless of the content of his message. Riding the fine line between harnessing that attention and letting the president dictate the terms of engagement will be a crucial part of any campaign against him; with their bold new plans for the economy and the social safety net, Democrats are clearly hoping they can hold that engagement on what they see as their natural turf.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether economic grist alone can empower Democrats to take down Trump. It certainly didn\u2019t work for Hillary Clinton. With his ability to command entire news cycles in his pajamas, Trump undeniably has the upper hand in driving the conversation, and Democrats will have to respond effectively to him no matter where he takes it.\n\nConnie Razza, vice president of policy and research at progressive think tank Demos, argues that Democrats need to use policy ideas to directly counter the president\u2019s identity-based appeal.\n\n\u201cIf progressives are silent on race, then the other side gets to try and reframe it so that they can take what is clearly not in the interest of working and middle-class white folks and make it palatable because they\u2019re vilifying people of color,\u201d Razza said.\n\nThat will be no small feat for a party already dealing with its own world of internal conflict on identity politics. And as the primary draws nearer, new fault lines are likely to emerge.\n\n\u201cIn a primary the incentive is to distinguish yourself and not necessarily be unified,\u201d said Abernathy of the Roosevelt Institute.\n\nAnd policy wonks are wary of the possibility that Democrats\u2019 newfound appetite for redistribution may not last\u2014or that the heat of electoral politics will see earnest, research-backed ideas watered down into something entirely different on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cOne thing we have to be careful in going forward with these bold ideas is to watch for the risk that they get watered down or turned into something else,\u201d said Hamilton, the economist. \u201cSomeone could take a job guarantee and turn it into a welfare-to-work program, and we certainly don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nDerek Robertson is a news assistant for POLITICO Magazine.

The asylum seekers, who are fleeing from violence and poverty, are more than 800 miles from Texas\u2019 southern border.\n\nIn his remarks, Trump said that \u201cthere\u2019s not much difference\u201d between a firearm and getting hit in the face with a rock.\n\n\u201cThey want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019ll consider \u2014 and I told them \u2014 consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I say consider it a rifle.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is weighing a series of policy options to limit asylum seekers\u2019 ability to enter the United States.\n\nWhite House officials had initially been planning a high-profile immigration-focused speech this week, but the mass shooting in Pittsburgh upended those plans. Still, Trump has pounced on a caravan of Central American migrants that is slowly making its way to the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to rally his base ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. In recent days, he has floated the idea of issuing an executive order to end birthright citizenship, a proposal that experts say wouldn\u2019t survive legal challenges.\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

The troops will not conduct law enforcement operations, but some of them will be armed for self-defense, administration officials said Monday.\n\nUnder existing rules of engagement, deployed troops should use deadly force only \u201cwhen there is a reasonable belief\u201d the subject \u201cposes an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\u201d\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s use-of-force handbook offers similar guidance. The handbook says agents should not discharge firearms in response to thrown or launched projectiles unless the agent has reason to believe the subject \u201cposes an imminent danger of serious physical injury or death\u201d to the agent or another person.\n\nThe handbook suggests agents seek cover or distance themselves from the threat in such a situation.\n\nTrump also said Thursday that the administration would seek to detain all migrants arrested at the border, including families and asylum seekers. To accomplish that, he said, the troops would build tent cities on the border.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting up massive cities of tents,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military is helping us incredibly well. \u2026 We have thousands of tents, we have a lot of tents, we have a lot of everything. We\u2019re going to hold them right there, we\u2019re not letting them into our country.\u201d\n\nThe 1997 Flores settlement agreement limits to 20 days the time a child can be kept in detention with a parent. A ruling earlier this year suggested parents may waive that right, but the Homeland Security Department is already at capacity with family detention space. Under the agreement, family detention centers must also be nonsecure, state-licensed facilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on a system where they stay together,\u201d Trump said of migrant families, without offering more details.\n\nThe president did not explain how the migrant tent cities would be funded, but resources for detention facilities have been an impediment to mass detentions during the course of his administration.\n\nIn a January 2017 executive order issued just days after taking office, Trump called for migrants caught at the border to be detained pending the outcome of removal proceedings. But budget limitations and legal restrictions have kept that from becoming a reality.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, called Trump\u2019s speech \u201ca political stunt aimed at whipping up fear and xenophobia just days before the election.\u201d\n\nThompson said in a written statement that Trump and Republicans \u201chave sunk to new lows with hateful rhetoric and racist campaign ads.\u201d Trump on Wednesday tweeted an inflammatory video that featured an undocumented immigrant convicted of killing two law enforcement officers.\n\nThe White House and the Department of Homeland Security have been weighing an executive action and a regulatory change that would restrict certain migrants\u2019 ability to seek asylum.\n\nPeople familiar with the White House maneuvers told POLITICO last week that the administration could seek to bar certain asylum seekers under a federal statute that authorizes the president to suspend entry of foreigners deemed \u201cdetrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe statute, 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, served as part of the legal basis for Trump\u2019s travel ban executive orders. The Supreme Court in June upheld the third version of the policy, which critics labeled a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d\n\nA person familiar with the planning said the fast-track regulation wasn\u2019t ready in time for Thursday\u2019s speech but remained under consideration.\n\nThe White House has also weighed a reprise of its family separation policy, which sparked widespread opposition earlier this year. Under the plan, migrant parents would be offered the \u201cbinary choice\u201d to remain in detention with a child or have the child sent to a shelter where they could be released to a sponsor, POLITICO reported in October.\n\nHealth and Human Services Department officials worried Thursday that Trump could embrace the controversial policy in his speech, according to a source briefed on the deliberations. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen called HHS Secretary Alex Azar early in the day, which put officials on high alert, the person said.\n\nThe Trump administration previewed a wide range of asylum actions in its fall regulatory agenda and could potentially fast-track one or more of those measures, according to Jessica Vaughan, a policy director with the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates lower levels of immigration.\n\nOne option could be a regulation to toughen the standard for a migrant to claim \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution, the first step in an asylum claim. The administration said in its fall regulatory agenda that it intended to issue a proposed rule on the issue in September 2019.\n\nAnother planned regulation would narrow asylum standards to align with new immigration court precedent. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June moved to block most migrants from obtaining asylum based on gang victimization or domestic violence. The administration slated a related proposed rule for December.\n\nWhile the measures are under consideration as part of broad efforts to reduce migrant flows at the border, it remains unclear whether they could be part of the executive action Trump plans to announce next week.\n\nTrump has come under criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for his unsubstantiated claims about the migrant caravan, casting the group of people as an \u201cinvasion\u201d and warning without evidence that the group contains gang members and \u201cunknown Middle Easterners.\u201d\n\nIn his speech Thursday, Trump said migrants arriving at the border had engaged in a \u201crampant abuse\u201d of the asylum system and displaced legitimate asylum seekers. He said migrants parrot certain phrases to clear the baseline to begin seeking asylum.\n\n\u201cThey understand the law better than the lawyers understand the law,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president hammered Democrats as the party of \u201copen borders\u201d and said they favored granting a broad range of public benefits to undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cOnce [migrants] arrive, the Democrat Party\u2019s vision is to offer them free health care, free welfare, free education and even the right to vote,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou and the hardworking taxpayers of our country will be asked to pick up the entire tab. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened. \u2026 In many cases, they\u2019ve got some big medical problems before they get here.\u201d\n\nUndocumented immigrants have access to few federal benefits, but can obtain emergency medical care, public education for children, and services through a health and nutrition program for pregnant women and young children.\n\nThe pro-migrant Physicians for Human Rights said Thursday that Trump\u2019s attempt to deter asylum seekers violated international refugee agreements.\n\n\u201cMost of these migrants are coming from countries where they face widespread violence and intimidation, and many have no choice but to flee,\u201d said Kathryn Hampton, an asylum program officer with the group. \u201cThey have a legal right to seek asylum and to have their cases heard once they have arrived on U.S. soil.\u201d\n\nOverall, migrant arrests at the border in fiscal year 2018 remained below the average level under President Barack Obama and far below the high levels of the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nGabby Orr, Dan Diamond, Rebecca Morin and Wesley Morgan contributed to this report.", "Only one-quarter of the poll\u2019s respondents believe that Moscow is very likely to interfere, while a further 22 percent believe it is somewhat likely to do so. | Gabriel Rossi/Getty Images POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL Poll: Less than half of Americans predict Russian interference in midterms\n\nNearly half of Americans believe that the Russian government will help Republicans if it tries to influence Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, and 4 in 10 Americans would be \u201cmuch more likely\u201d to vote if they learned that a foreign government was interfering in the election, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll.\n\nBut only 47 percent of people believe that Russia will try to influence the midterm elections, the poll showed, even after months of warnings from senior intelligence and national security officials \u2014 plus recent criminal charges \u2014 about the Kremlin\u2019s ongoing influence operations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOnly one-quarter of the poll\u2019s respondents believe that Moscow is very likely to interfere, while a further 22 percent believe it is somewhat likely to do so.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) issued the sternest rebuke to date on Wednesday, threatening unspecified retaliatory moves if the tax, or similar ones proposed by the EU and other countries, takes effect in 2020 as planned. \u201cIf the United Kingdom or other countries proceed, that will prompt a review of our U.S. tax and regulatory approach to determine what actions are appropriate to ensure a level playing field in global markets,\u201d Brady said in a statement, per our Aaron Lorenzo. If Brady has anything particular in mind, neither he nor his staff provided any clues.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nExperts say that may be because the options for striking back are limited. \u201cI think this is a difficult issue for Congress and the Administration,\u201d said Mark Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy. David Rosenbloom, another former Treasury tax official who\u2019s now at Caplin & Drysdale, said he doubts the proposed taxes would run afoul of tax treaties. \u201cEven if such taxes created issues under tax treaties, (a) that is not a matter for Congress to do anything about; (b) it would take years to have the question played out in bilateral negotiations and domestic courts; and (c) it is humorous for the US to complain about tax treaty issues, and especially for Brady to complain, given that the TCJA is rife with potential tax treaty \u2018violations,\u2019\u201d Rosenbloom said.\n\nRichard Asquith, vice president for Global Indirect Tax at Avalara, sees a risk for the U.K. in retaliatory tariffs by the U.S., he said in a statement about the U.K. tax. Indeed, President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been shy about playing the tariff card when he thinks the U.S. is being treated unfairly, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin issued two statements recently denouncing digital taxes. On the other hand, Trump hasn\u2019t been a fan of Big Tech recently, largely for political reasons.\n\nOther recent U.S.-European flare-ups over taxes may offer clues to what's ahead. Officials in the Obama and Trump administrations, along with lawmakers in both parties, have railed against EU \u201cstate aid\u201d investigations into member countries\u2019 tax deals with several U.S. corporations. In 2016, the Obama Treasury Department reviewed the possible use of a 1934 law, Section 891, which would theoretically allow the president to levy double-taxes on corporations and people from countries accused of imposing discriminatory or extraterritorial taxes on U.S. entities. That was considered mere saber rattling, though, since the law would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement. Another possibility mentioned at the time was legislation to impose withholding taxes on interest payments to Europe.\n\nON THE SAME PAGE NOW: Brady and Trump issued a joint statement Wednesday saying: \u201cWe are committed to delivering an additional 10 percent tax cut to middle-class workers across the country. And we intend to take swift action on this legislation at the start of the 116th Congress.\" The statement seemed designed to clarify the situation after the White House and Capitol Hill appeared to be talking past each other for the last couple weeks.\n\nTo recap: When Trump said on Oct. 20 that administration officials and congressional leaders were working on the tax cut, it seemed to be news to those officials and leaders. A couple days later, Trump said \u201cwe\u2019re putting in a resolution sometime in the next week or week and a half, two weeks\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019ll do the vote after the election.\u201d Then Brady told CNBC that Republicans wouldn\u2019t act on the plan until \u201cthe new session of Congress if Republicans maintain control of the House and the Senate.\u201d Now it\u2019s settled \u2014 as long as Trump doesn\u2019t move the goal posts, as he\u2019s wont to do.\n\nBOO!

And some experts think GRATs could be in play even if Republicans keep control of both houses of Congress. \u201c\u2026Austin Bramwell of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see GRAT limits emerge as a revenue raiser in bipartisan or even Republican-led initiatives,\u201d Tax Notes said.\n\nLOOKING UP FOR NOW IN THE STATES: It\u2019s boom time for state revenues, partly due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It\u2019s also a time of fiscal uncertainty for states, partly due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115). State tax revenues grew 7.1 percent through the first three quarters of state fiscal year 2018, according to a preliminary estimate by the Urban Institute. \u201cHigh income tax revenues in a few states were responsible for much of the increase,\u201d the report said. Collections \u201cwere boosted related to income earned in 2017, stemming from both anticipation of and passage of the TCJA and the final realization date for Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 policies.\u201d\n\nOn the flip-side, there are plenty of unknowns out there. The report cited five: how the states respond to continued implementation of the TCJA, with a nod to efforts by several states to get around the new cap on the state and local tax deduction; the impact of the TCJA\u2019s corporate repatriation provision, which could boost state revenues; the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow states to require remote sellers to collect sales tax from their residents; a second high court decision that legalized sports betting, which could also be a revenue boon for states; and trade uncertainty driven by tariffs implemented or threatened by Trump, which could be a revenue drain.\n\nRecently enacted state tax changes, \u201ccoupled with the boosted tax revenues attributable to federal tax policy changes, helped the states end fiscal year2018 on a positive note,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cHowever, large fiscal uncertainties lie ahead for the states in the coming months as state revenues fluctuate in response to federal income tax changes, the Wayfair decision, and state responses to both.\u201d\n\nINTERNATIONAL UPDATE\n\nU.K. NEEDS A HEALTHY BUDGET: Just a couple days after Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, included the digital tax in his budget, he\u2019s been told by a prominent think tank that the country needs to overhaul its tax system to raise revenue for the National Health Service, since the budget also includes a tax cut for upper-income Brits.\n\n\u201cUrging the chancellor to conduct a formal review of taxation alongside the government\u2019s planned spending review next year, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said Hammond would be unable to balance the books in future without finding extra tax revenue,\u201d The Guardian reported. \u201cJagjit Chadha, the director of NIESR, said public spending on health would need to rise significantly to accommodate Britain\u2019s ageing population by the middle of this century. Without raising more money from tax, this could generate \u2018some very scary numbers\u2019 for the national debt.\u201d\n\nSTATE NEWS\n\nTO THE VICTOR, THE SPOILS: South Dakota, the state that launched the case that led to the Supreme Court\u2019s Wayfair decision, will now be able to enjoy the fruits of its victory. The original lawsuit that pitted the state against several online retailers has finally been settled. \u201cThe settlement Wednesday resolves all remaining issues not addressed by the [Supreme] court and will allow the state to collect sales tax from Wayfair, Overstock and Newegg \u2014 the three businesses involved in the lawsuit \u2014 starting Jan. 1, 2019,\u201d the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported.\n\nTAXING HOMES TO HELP THE HOMELESS: Chicago is considering a new tax on people who buy expensive homes in the city, which would fund efforts to combat homelessness. The plan would impose a one-time tax of 1.2 percent of the value of homes that cost more than $1 million. The tax \u201ccould deter upper-income buyers who have already been nicked by property tax increases and lost homeownership deductions, according to agents and lenders who work with the city's luxury real estate market,\u201d Crain\u2019s Chicago Business says. Proponents pushed back. The tax is \u201casking people who can afford to buy these homes to pay according to their means to end homelessness in their city,\" Mary Tarullo, deputy director of policy for the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, told Crain\u2019s. \"They have the means to contribute to solving this problem.\"\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 DealBook says the U.K.\u2019s digital tax has structural problems.\n\nAn obscure tax case on the Supreme Court docket is more than it seems.\n\nThe court heard arguments Wednesday in a case involving tribal law and state fuel taxes.\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nCrime insurance claims surge by 24 percent on Halloween, more than any other single day, due to tricks of the outlaw kind. \"This includes particularly sharp increases in theft, both inside and outside the home, and vandalism,\" according to NerdWallet.", "Survey: More North American companies looking within region for growth\n\nWith help from Sabrina Rodriguez, Doug Palmer, Catherine Boudreau and Adam Behsudi\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This edition of Morning Trade is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Trade subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro\u2019s comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nON TAP TODAY: North American companies are increasingly looking within the region for opportunities for growth, rather than elsewhere around the globe, a new HSBC survey shows. Plus, the Trump administration has unexpectedly rejected all de minimis waivers under the Generalized System of Preferences program and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow offers his thoughts on what might happen when Trump speaks to Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month. Let\u2019s start here:\n\nSURVEY: MORE NORTH AMERICAN COMPANIES LOOKING WITHIN REGION FOR GROWTH: Businesses in the United States, Mexico and Canada are looking more closely at trading opportunities with each other rather than with partners outside of the region, according to a new survey by banking giant HSBC out this morning.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real pivot to intra-regional,\u201d Jaron Campbell, HSBC\u2019s U.S. head of international subsidiary banking, told Morning Trade.\n\nThe survey was wrapped up before the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement was formally announced, but roughly half of the 500 U.S. businesses surveyed said the existing NAFTA would have a continued positive impact on their business over the next three years. Still, more than two-thirds of U.S. firms believe governments are becoming more protective of their domestic businesses.\n\nNeighborly love: The U.S., Mexico and Canada all named each other as their top two markets for growth, the HSBC survey shows. Almost half of Mexican and Canadian companies named the United States one of the top three markets where they will look to expand in the next few years. More than one-third of Mexican companies named Canada a top three market for expansion. Canadian companies also named Mexico as a top three market \u2014 but much less frequently, with only 15 percent identifying Mexico as a priority market.\n\nGood news, bad news for China: Businesses globally are increasingly looking within their regions for trading opportunities, according to the survey, which drew responses from more than 8,650 companies in 34 markets. More Asia-Pacific companies are looking to China as a growth market, while Asian interest in the North America market declined. Only 15 percent of North American firms cited Asia as a top market for growth \u2014 down from 33 percent in the previous survey, which was released in March.\n\nTariff connection: A majority of U.S. firms remain positive about the outlook for global trade. However, most companies with a negative outlook cite tariffs and U.S. trade uncertainty with China as key concerns.\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY, NOV. 1!

USTR can still waive the duty if total imports of the good are less than the de minimis threshold of $23.5 million. But this year, it said no to 92 de minimis waivers from 14 countries: Suriname, the Falkland Islands, Egypt, the Philippines, Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, Belize, and Turkey.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, de minimis waivers have never been denied on a wholesale basis,\u201d Marideth Sandler, CEO and principal trade adviser at Sandler Trade, said in an email. That was backed up by Dan Anthony, who coordinates the business community\u2019s Coalition for GSP. The de minimis waivers involve such a small volume of trade that they typically have been automatically approved without companies even making requests, he said.\n\nImporters will have to pay an estimated $8 million in tariffs over the next year without the waiver. That will affect importers of goods like orchids from Thailand, swordfish fillets from Ecuador and gherkins from India. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge number in the scheme of things,\u201d but it could result in some small importers suddenly facing hundreds of thousands of additional dollars in unexpected charges, Anthony said.\n\nCHINA TARIFF EXCLUSION REQUESTS: THE EARLY RESULTS ARE IN: After Morning Trade\u2019s reporting Wednesday on the China tariff exclusion process, an alert reader directed us to a link to a spreadsheet on USTR\u2019s Section 301 investigation page that shows the status of more than 5,000 requests over the past several months for products to be excluded from the 25 percent tariff that Trump imposed on an initial $34 billion worth of Chinese goods.\n\nAs of Oct. 26, USTR denied around 816 exclusion requests, including more than 300 from one company, Blaine, Minn.-based Arrowhead Electrical Products, which filed its requests in August, well ahead of the Oct. 9 deadline. USTR also denied 29 requests from IRISO U.S.A in Farmington Hills, Mich.; 26 from Oasis International in Columbus, Ohio; 22 from Dimplex Thermal Solutions in Kalamazoo, Mich.; and 22 from Engel Machinery in York County, Pa., among others.\n\nNo approvals so far: USTR\u2019s spreadsheet categorizes requests that have not been denied into four different stages: As of Oct 26, 2,533 requests were still in stage 1 of the review and 1,494 were in stage 2. None the requests had reached stage 4, which indicates approval, but 173 were in stage 3, which indicates they will be approved if USTR receives a final sign-off from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The tariffs for any product that receives an exclusion will be revoked retroactively to July 6, when they went into effect. However, the exclusion is only good for one year after USTR\u2019s decision is published in the Federal Register.\n\nWARREN WEIGHS IN ON COMMERCE EXCLUSIONS: The Commerce Department is conducting its own exclusion process for companies looking to avoid the administration\u2019s 25 percent tariff on imported steel \u2014 and it\u2019s favoring foreign-owned firms over American companies, according to Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIn a letter sent Tuesday to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the Massachusetts Democrat accused the administration of undermining American producers by allowing large imports of foreign steel to come in tariff-free, while harming U.S. steel-dependent companies \u201cinstead of improving their competitive advantage over companies headquartered in China and other foreign countries.\u201d\n\nCommerce pushback: Agency spokesman James Rockas replied that Warren's analysis \"betrays a lack of understanding of the exclusion process, which was put in place to supply domestic consumers with steel that could not or would not be produced here in the United States or in an exempted country.\" Doug has the story here.\n\nBRADY CHIMES IN ON DIGITAL TAX CONCERNS: House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady fired a warning shot across the Atlantic on Wednesday, saying Congress will consider ways to hit back against the U.K. and other countries if they move forward with proposed digital services taxes.\n\n\u201cIf the United Kingdom or other countries proceed, that will prompt a review of our U.S. tax and regulatory approach to determine what actions are appropriate to ensure a level playing field in global markets,\u201d Brady said in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest backlash from U.S. officials to the U.K. proposal, though publicly the most threatening, Pro Tax\u2019s Aaron Lorenzo reports. Brady called the 2 percent tax included in the U.K. budget proposal on Monday \"troubling.\"\n\nTRADE TALK ON THE TRAIL: Here\u2019s a snapshot of what candidates are saying about trade in Midwest battleground states.

But these gains will be more than negated by those two countries\u2019 retaliatory tariffs on American farm goods, ranging from cheese and pork to fruits and vegetables, which were implemented in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, according a new economic analysis published Tuesday.\n\nThe analysis \u2014 commissioned by Farm Foundation and conducted by Purdue University \u2014 estimates that if these retaliatory tariffs continue long-term, U.S. farmers and ranchers could lose nearly $1.8 billion in exports.\n\nThe world stage: Purdue University also analyzed the combined impact of retaliatory tariffs by major trading partners like Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union on U.S. farm goods, determining that exports could shrink by nearly $8 billion over time. The biggest drops will be in oilseeds like soybeans, as a result of the 25 percent tariff China slapped on U.S. exports of the crop, followed by meat products.\n\nLabor: About 45,000 workers would shift away from the agricultural and food sector, most of which from the oilseed industry.\n\nSo how\u2019s China doing? Not so hot, our partners at the South China Morning Post report. Economic growth is slowing quicker than expected, business sentiment is down and export demand dipped sharply, according to a Chinese government index.\n\nNext year could be more brutal when the trade war jumps to new heights. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods are set to ratchet up from 10 percent to 25 percent in January.\n\nKUDLOW: NOTHING SET IN STONE WITH CHINA TARIFFS: National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow cautioned against getting \u201cahead of your skis\u201d when it comes to more tariffs on China. Bloomberg reported earlier this week that the White House was poised to announce additional tariffs against Beijing if talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping don\u2019t go well at the upcoming G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not forecasting, but it is possible that some good, positive things could \u2014 I say could \u2014 come out of President Trump, President Xi talks,\u201d Kudlow told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nKudlow said China knows what the U.S. is demanding. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had intense talks lately, but there\u2019s alway communication,\u201d he said.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT\n\n\u2014 The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on consumer prices will likely be manageable this holiday season, in part because of early orders and the devaluation of China\u2019s yuan, Yahoo Finance reports.\n\n\u2014 U.S. companies are beginning to raise prices on goods and services as they pass on higher costs to customers after years of low inflation, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nTHAT'S ALL FOR MORNING TRADE!

FDA warned consumers and health care providers not to use the test results to stop or change any medication. \"Results from this test should be confirmed with independent pharmacogenetic testing before making any medical decisions,\" the agency said in a news release.\n\nThe company has had a strong past few months: in July, the startup inked a four-year deal with GlaxoSmithKline to help drug development. It also picked up an additional $300 million in deals with the pharmaceutical giant, bringing its total funding to $786 million (according to industry database Crunchbase).\n\n\u2014 Cellphone merger blasted: Public Knowledge, Free Press, the Communications Workers of America and the Rural Wireless Association aren\u2019t fond of a proposed merger between T-Mobile and Sprint, our Tech colleague Margaret Harding McGill reports.

Some technologies are barely sending data to the patient record: for example, only 25 percent of organizations said they have IV pumps transmit data to the EHR.\n\nExchange with outside organizations is, in some cases, high. 85 percent of respondents said they can consume discrete data from outside hospitals, and 82 percent said the same for outside physicians. Skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies are lagging as exchange partners; only 60 percent said their EHRs could consume data from those organizations.\n\nGENETIC PRIVACY ALSO RAISING CONCERNS: People have deep concerns about genetic data and privacy, a research article in PLoS ONE that synthesizes surveys with nearly 48,000 respondents concludes. But they\u2019re nevertheless willing to share their DNA.

A select joint pensions committee in Congress is tasked with producing a bipartisan solution by the end of this month, but it hasn\u2019t met since July. If nothing is done, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which insures multiemployer pensions, will go bankrupt as soon as 2025.\n\nThe pensions \u201csupercommittee\u201d is deadlocked over whether to support the Democratic-backed Butch Lewis Act, which would extend to struggling plans low-interest federal loans that could be repaid over 30 years. Republican committee members oppose anything that smacks of a bailout, even though more than two dozen business and industry groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have urged lawmakers to embrace low-interest loans.\n\n\u201cPlans are not getting better, and that may be a surprise to the general public because last year was a fairly good year for investment returns,\u201d Peter Hardcastle, investment consultant and actuary at Cheiron, told Morning Shift. \u201cThe longer it takes to find a solution, the more difficult the solution is going to be.\u201d\n\nAs the clock ticks, insolvent plans have been lining up at Treasury to request permission to trim benefits under a 2014 multiemployer reform bill.

Three district court judges have barred DACA\u2019s phaseout; the matter is now before the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit. DOJ urged the appeals court to rule before Oct. 31, fearing a ruling by the liberal 9th Circuit past that deadline would make it impossible for the Supreme Court to hear an appeal this term. But the witching hour came without an appellate decision.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time the administration asked SCOTUS to take up DACA.

During closing remarks at a well-attended meeting on sexual harassment, Feldblum, who may not have enough Senate votes to be reconfirmed, challenged HR officials to disclose the results of their harassment investigations to accusers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s very helpful for someone who has gotten the courage to come forward to be told at the end \u2018we did an investigation and we\u2019ve dealt with it appropriately,\u2019\u201d Feldblum said. \u201cAnd when I talk to HR people, that\u2019s what they\u2019re all trained to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to challenge that assumption,\u201d Feldblum added. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to convey our corrective action, but let\u2019s put our heads together and think about how we can make that work.\u201d\n\nFour GOP senators \u2014 Mike Lee (R-Utah), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and James Lankford (R-Okla.) \u2014 are holding up Feldblum\u2019s renomination for reasons that remain murky. It appears to have something to do with Feldblum openly identifying as a lesbian and favoring left-leaning social policies. In February, Lee called Feldblum, the first openly LGBT person to serve on the commission, a \u201cthreat to marriage\u201d because she\u2019d said society ought to recognize a \u201cwide array of non-marital social structures.\u201d\n\nFeldblum, in her remarks, tacitly acknowledged that her time on the EEOC may be running out, heaping praise on Acting Chairwoman Victoria Lipnic. \u201cI will let you know, just in case this sounds like a goodbye speech, it\u2019s not,\u201d Feldblum said. \u201cI am planning to serve out any term I am confirmed to.\u201d\n\nWorker Safety\n\nSAFETY FOR WORKING WOMEN: Safety risks in the workplace are different for women, Gloria Gonzalez reports for Business Insurance. Initiating discussions about workplace violence and designing personal protective equipment that fits women more easily would improve an imbalance between protections for men and women, safety experts say.\n\nSeventy percent of workers reporting trauma from nonfatal workplace violence in 2016 were female, and 70 percent worked in health care and social assistance, according to BLS. \u201cMany times when we think about workplace violence, we think about it in terms of active shooter,\u201d said Diana Stegall, ASSP president-elect. \u201cBut when you look at the injuries that actually happen, many times it\u2019s those people who were providing care.\u201d\n\nProfessionals also noted that ill-fitting personal protective equipment can \u201clead to increased hazards.\u201d \u201cIf you put a women in PPE and it doesn\u2019t fit her \u2026 do they feel unprotected because it doesn\u2019t fit right? Or more importantly, do they not wear it because it doesn\u2019t fit?\u201d Sally Smart, a technical safety specialist, told Gonzalez. \u201cSometimes employers don\u2019t understand that.

AFSCME outlawed the collection of mandatory fees from non-union members to offset collective bargaining costs, cutting off a major source of funding before Election Day. The ruling threatened to dampen union membership rolls and endanger teachers unions\u2019 long-standing position as stalwarts of Democratic Party politics and grassroots organizing.\n\n\u2014 Nine union leaders in eight states interviewed by POLITICO reported modest but anticipated drops in membership since the court decision, in addition to the loss of thousands of non-members who used to pay mandatory union fees.\n\n\u2014 At the same time, union leaders reported an uptick in members attending rallies, canvassing neighborhoods and phone banking for the midterms \u2014 though the teachers unions\u2019 national rankings in political giving to candidates slipped. Even conservatives acknowledged that teachers remained key to Democratic Party election organizing. Caitlin Emma and Mel Leonor have the story.\n\n\u2014 State leaders insist it\u2019s been a banner election year. \u201cWhen I go and I see our members out there on the stump or at a rally, I see a level of enthusiasm and engagement that I did not see four years ago or two years ago in the presidential race,\u201d said Dan Montgomery, president of the Illinois Federation of Teachers, a state affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\u2014 In Illinois, with more than 100,000 members, Montgomery said the union lost about 6,500 non-union fee payers and about 250 members since the Janus decision. \u201cOur members want change,\u201d he said. \u201cI see a blue wave coming in Illinois.

Many signed as \u201cAnonymous\u201d or Jane Doe.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe proposed changes will make schools even less safe for survivors and enable more perpetrators to commit sexual assault in schools without consequence,\u201d the letter says. It raises concerns that schools may not be required to investigate assaults that take place off campus and that schools may only be required to investigate complaints made to certain officials. Read it here.\n\n\u2014 The letter comes as advocacy groups renew their legal fight against DeVos' temporary Title IX rules after a federal judge in California earlier this month dismissed many of their previous claims. The groups, led by SurvJustice, which represents sexual assault survivors, filed an amended complaint Wednesday arguing DeVos\u2019 interim Title IX guidelines violate the Fifth Amendment because the policy \"disproportionately burdens women and girls\" and \"was motivated by the baseless and discriminatory but longstanding stereotype that women and girls tend to lie about or exaggerate experiences of sexual assault and harassment.\" More on that here.\n\n\u2014 Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill blasted the lawsuit as \u201cnothing more than a baseless, politically motivated attack on the Secretary. She and OCR staff met with a number of people on this important issue including survivors, falsely accused students, college presidents and university GCs and the message was very clear from all of them \u2014 we have to get this right on behalf of students and the current process isn\u2019t serving students well. The Secretary is committed to Title IX reforms that will ensure survivors feel empowered to come forward, all students are afforded due process and universities have clear rules to follow.\u201d\n\nSPEAKING OF TITLE IX: The National Women\u2019s Law Center and more than 100 other advocacy groups sent a letter this morning to the Education, Labor and Justice departments and HHS blasting a Trump administration proposal to narrowly define gender under federal law. \u201cYour agencies are seeking to legally erase transgender, non-binary, and intersex people, which is an abomination,\u201d the letter says. \"This attempt to narrow our civil rights laws would set back women\u2019s rights and make it easier to discriminate against anyone who is perceived as not conforming to rigid stereotypes.\u201d Read it here.\n\nMIDTERMS WATCH\n\nPOLL: EDUCATION NOT A TOP PRIORITY FOR VOTERS: Just 6 percent of voters said education issues are the top set of issues on their mind when casting a vote in congressional races in the midterms. That\u2019s according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll out this morning.\n\n\u2014 Education is ranked only above energy issues, which registered with just 4 percent of those polled. Education trails economic, security, health care, seniors\u2019 and women\u2019s issues and is tied with \u201cother.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Most voters \u2014 48 percent \u2014 said they trust Democrats more to handle education issues. Thirty-two percent said they trust Republicans more and 20 percent said they didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t have an opinion.\n\n\u2014 Meanwhile, more than a third of voters, 36 percent, said adding restrictions on gun ownership is a top priority. Another 22 percent said it\u2019s important, but not their top priority. Twelve percent say it\u2019s not important and nearly a quarter, 23 percent, say it shouldn\u2019t be done. Voters are split on who they trust more to handle gun policy, with Democrats and Republicans each drawing 41 percent. The rest said they didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t have an opinion.\n\n\u2014 Most voters also say passing a bill granting citizenship to young people brought to the U.S. illegally when they were children is important to them. Thirty percent said it\u2019s a top priority; 29 percent said it\u2019s important, but not a top priority. Sixteen percent say it\u2019s not important and another 16 percent say it shouldn\u2019t be done. The poll surveyed 2,543 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. Read more in the toplines and crosstabs.\n\nEDUCATORS PLEDGE TO HELP STUDENTS VOTE: Hundreds of teachers and college professors have signed an online pledge that says \"we will make every effort to accommodate students as they seek to participate in our democracy.\" That includes recording classes and distributing notes, providing information about voter registration and polling places, and even rescheduling classes or excusing absences so students can head to the polls.\n\n\u2014 The pledge is meant to be nonpartisan. It reads in part: \"We hope that all students, no matter who they support, will make their voices heard at the ballot box this November.\" It was started by a group of students at Yale Law School and Columbia Business School.\n\n\u2014 It has drawn some notable names, including former Education Secretary Arne Duncan (now a distinguished senior fellow at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy) and former secretaries of State Madeleine Albright (a professor at Georgetown) and John Kerry (a distinguished fellow for global affairs at Yale's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs).\n\nMEANWHILE: A new white paper by Campus Labs takes a look at how students across the U.S. organize on college campuses. Among the organization\u2019s findings: In states that voted for President Barack Obama in 2012, but President Donald Trump in 2016, there was a drop in Republican group memberships and a correlating increase in Democratic-based organization membership. The split was particularly emphatic during spring 2017 after Trump\u2019s election, according to the report. Check out the full report.\n\nEDUCATION DEPARTMENT\n\nFEDERAL EMPLOYEES UNION SLAMS EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OVERHAUL: The American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents federal employees, says a major reorganization of the Education Department is a \u201ccalculated tactic\u201d meant \u201cto force out dedicated employees\u201d by making the agency \u201ca miserable and untenable place to work.\u201d Morning Education earlier this week reported new details of that reorganization.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Department of Education reorganization is yet the latest act by Betsy DeVos in her quest to decimate the mission of the Department of Education and attack the Department\u2019s employees,\u201d AFGE said in a statement. \u201cMany employees are being displaced and moved to positions and/or departments in which they have no training or background. \u2026 Employee satisfaction scores have already sharply declined, this will only hasten further decline of employee satisfaction and their ability to provide critical services to the American public.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The sweeping overhaul of the agency, which picked up steam this year, stems from an executive order Trump issued in March 2017 that directed agencies to examine whether their organizational structures could be improved. Spokeswoman Liz Hill said the effort, which is expected to be completed by early January, is \u201cfocused on streamlining our internal processes in an effort to make the department more efficient, coordinated and responsive for students, educators, parents and taxpayers.\u201d\n\nPORTMAN PRESSES DEVOS ON PARENT LOAN FORGIVENESS: Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) on Wednesday sent DeVos a second letter asking her to forgive federal student loans made to parents whose children experience a total and permanent disability. Known as Parent PLUS loans, they are made to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Portman was joined on the letter by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) and Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.).\n\n\u2014 Portman and other lawmakers first sent DeVos a letter in March about the issue. \u201cWe reiterate the message from our previous letter and urge you to discharge all Parent PLUS loans borrowed on behalf of students who become totally and permanently disabled,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in their letter this week. \u201cWe are concerned that it has been six months since we sent our original inquiry, and we still have not received a reply.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Students who experience a total and permanent disability are discharged from paying most of their federal student loans. But parents of those students remain liable for the Parent PLUS debt. The average Parent PLUS loan is $15,880, which can be a burden when caring for a child, the lawmakers note. Portman introduced a bill last year, S.2258 (115), to discharge parents of the debt. Langevin introduced a companion bill, H.R. 2270 (115), but the legislation never gained traction.\n\n\u2014 Spokeswoman Liz Hill said, \u201cCongress has not authorized the Department to discharge parent borrowers from Parent PLUS loans for students who have become totally and permanently disabled. The Department is certainly willing to work with Congress to address these difficult situations.\u201d\n\nMOVERS AND SHAKERS\n\n\u2014 Deirdre Latour will be the next chief corporate affairs officer at Pearson beginning Jan. 1.

We also asked whether a foreign influence campaign would motivate more voters to head to the polls \u2014 or cause them to stay home. Here\u2019s what we found out:\n\nNearly half of Americans believe that the Russian government will help Republicans if it tries to influence Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, and 4 in 10 Americans would be \u201cmuch more likely\u201d to vote if they learned that a foreign government was interfering in the election, according to the poll. But only 47 percent of people believe that Russia will try to influence the midterm elections, even after months of warnings from senior intelligence and national security officials \u2014 plus recent criminal charges \u2014 about the Kremlin\u2019s ongoing influence operations.\n\nOnly one-quarter of the poll\u2019s respondents believe that Moscow is very likely to interfere, while another 22 percent believe it is somewhat likely to do so. Forty-eight percent of Americans believe the Russians would try to help Republicans, while 15 percent said they\u2019d help Democrats.\n\nForty-six percent of Americans said they would be more likely to vote if reports emerged about foreign government interference in the midterms, while only 12 percent said they would be less likely.

Ron Wyden.\n\nKrebs also told Wyden, a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that DHS has several ways of tackling \u201cend-of-life\u201d software: Outreach by the department\u2019s National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center to educate and train stakeholders, uncovering vulnerabilities through the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program, and regular advisories on digital risks and mitigation.\n\nTRUST US \u2014 The Trump administration is on top of election security and is well positioned to face cybersecurity threats during Tuesday\u2019s midterms, a group of senior administration officials told reporters during a short briefing Wednesday. The briefing, which was announced hours after a POLITICO story detailed the administration\u2019s lack of a strategy for countering foreign influence operations, produced little new information. Officials spent most of the time assuring reporters that they were working closely together and were committed to identifying, disrupting and if possible prosecuting election interference.\n\n\u201cThe progress we\u2019ve made since 2016, working with those state and local election officials, is immense,\u201d said one senior administration official. Because of improvements in the relationship between DHS and the states, \u201cwe\u2019re not just able to push information down, but we\u2019re receiving a great deal of information back from the state and local officials that allows all of us at the federal government to understand the threats that are targeting election systems and respond appropriately.\u201d\n\nAdministration staffers are fleshing out President Donald Trump\u2019s recent executive order creating a process for imposing interference-related sanctions. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hard at work since that executive order was signed,\u201d said a second senior administration official, \u201cto actually work through the framework, and how those sanctions would be scoped and implemented, in the event that we do see some level of interference in this election.\u201d\n\nThe White House will play an important role in the government\u2019s election security monitoring on Tuesday, the second official promised. \u201cA number of our partners are going to be standing up some operations, the official said. \u201cWe are fully ready to plug into each one of those and make sure that we\u2019re actively communicating with them throughout the course of the day. It\u2019s really a matter of maintaining situational awareness.\u201d\n\nTHE IT CROWD \u2014 More attention needs to be paid to IT networks in critical infrastructure, cybersecurity firm Vectra said in a report out today. While attacks on industrial control systems take the spotlight, IT networks are more frequently attacked because they usually have schematics and data of those control systems, Chris Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra, told MC. The report analyzed the behavior of attacks targeting manufacturing and utility networks. The company found that hackers often use or mimic network access programs used by the target company to infiltrate their targets, blending in with legitimate traffic.\n\nInstead of relying on log analysis, industries should focus on monitoring networks for unapproved behaviors as logs can be erased, Morales said. Network analysis can also provide clues on a hacker\u2019s method of attack. If an ICS was attacked, Morales said, it\u2019s likely that a hacker was also inside the IT network, too.\n\nONE IS BETTER THAN TWO \u2014 The federal government\u2019s new cloud computing policy should simplify the security certification process by requiring only one authorization, the Professional Services Council told Federal Chief Information Officer Suzette Kent in a recent letter. PSC, a leading government technology trade group, offered 20 suggestions for improving the recently released Cloud Smart strategy, and one of them concerned the way companies get permission to provide cloud services to agencies.\n\nPSC wants the Defense Department to amend its regulations to let companies use the FedRAMP certification, rather than a special DoD certification, to provide cloud services. The current rule, PSC said, \u201cimpedes access to commercial cloud services and innovation by requiring DoD-specific security authorization before a contract award.\u201d\n\nTHE SKY IS DARKEST BEFORE DAWN, RIGHT? \u2014 Global internet freedom is declining for the eighth consecutive year, according to the annual report released today from Freedom House. The human rights group studied 65 countries and found that while 19 saw a rise in internet freedom, 26 countries are in decline. Many restrictions coincided with elections, the group said. Almost half the countries manipulate social media content to drive discussions, the group says, while at least 17 are using \u201cfake news\u201d to suppress dissent. State surveillance has also increased in 18 countries.\n\nChina is the worst of the lot, the report asserts, and is exporting its techniques to at least 36 other countries through training sessions and seminars. The repeal of net neutrality means U.S. internet freedom has declined as well, Freedom House says, and the government needs to do more to protect user data.\n\nRECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY \u2014 Wyden chided the nation\u2019s spy chief for giving a classified answer about Trump administration's claims that China has meddled in U.S. elections. \u2026 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will be able to delete problematic content effectively by the end of 2019.\n\nTWEET OF THE DAY \u2014 Brutal.\n\nQUICK BYTES\n\n\u2014 Hacking the brain might just be possible if someone has this vulnerable medical device.

But the same database lists a global total of 13.5 million acres.\n\n\u2014 Why it matters: Getting the numbers right isn\u2019t just about proper bookkeeping \u2014 it\u2019s part of an effort to crack down on fraudulent organic products.\n\nThe data problem is unique to the organics sector, which has battled for decades to share an equal footing at USDA with conventional agriculture. Responsibility for collecting organic acreage stats has passed from agency to agency in recent years. It\u2019s now handled by the National Organic Program, which certifies products as \u201cUSDA Organic.\u201d (You know the green seal.)\n\nMark your calendars: USDA plans to release a proposed rule in early 2019 aimed at shoring up organic integrity. An increase in mandatory reporting to boost USDA\u2019s data collection efforts could be part of the rulemaking process.\n\nPros, grab some (organic?) coffee and catch up with Helena and Sarah\u2019s story.\n\nHAPPY THURSDAY, NOV. 1!

EPA did, however, set some dicamba spraying limits, Pro Ag\u2019s Liz Crampton reports.\n\nDrift from the chemical has caused unintended damage to millions of acres of crops across the South and Midwest. On Wednesday, the agency set new restrictions on its use, like a 57-foot buffer for endangered species habitats, and a sort of curfew (spraying is permitted from one hour after sunrise to two hours before sunset). A cap on \u201cover-the-top\u201d applications was lowered from four to two, as well.\n\nBayer, which inherited the dicamba license when it bought Monsanto, said after the EPA decision that it plans to train certified pesticide applicators on the label requirement changes. The company was set to provide further details today on what the decision means for growers.\n\nTARIFFS COULD OFFSET FARMER GAINS UNDER NAFTA 2.0: U.S. agriculture, particularly the dairy and poultry sectors, could reap an estimated $450 million from additional exports to Canada and Mexico under the new trade pact. But the gains would be more than negated by those two countries\u2019 retaliatory tariffs on American farm goods, according a new economic analysis published Tuesday.\n\nThe analysis from Farm Foundation and Purdue University estimates that U.S. farmers and ranchers could lose nearly $1.8 billion in exports if counter-tariffs continue long-term. Purdue also analyzed the combined impact of retaliatory tariffs from major trading partners like Canada, Mexico, China and the European Union, and determined that ag exports could shrink by nearly $8 billion over time.\n\n\u2014 The biggest drops will be in oilseeds like soybeans, due to Chinese retaliatory duties, followed by meat products. Pro Ag\u2019s Catherine Boudreau has the details.\n\nSo how\u2019s China doing? Not so hot, our South China Morning Post partners report. Economic growth is slowing quicker than expected, business sentiment is down and export demand dipped sharply, according to a Chinese government index.\n\nNext year could be more brutal, as U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods are set to ratchet up from 10 percent to 25 percent in January.\n\n\u2014 The White House wants China to feel the heat from the trade war, so that Beijing is more likely to come to the table or bend to some of Trump\u2019s trade demands. Trump has said tariffs on another $267 billion in Chinese goods will be ready if his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month doesn\u2019t go well.\n\n\u2014 However: Longtime China observers warn not to underestimate the country\u2019s ability to stomach economic hardship in pursuit of national gain. And the government is likely to spur growth with some monetary or fiscal stimulus.\n\nTRADE TURMOIL IN BATTLEGROUND FLORIDA: Indiana, North Dakota \u2026 and Florida? The Sunshine State could be another battleground where Trump\u2019s trade war could affect close, critical races in next week\u2019s elections.\n\nThe president stumped Wednesday night in Fort Myers for Republicans in Florida\u2019s tight Senate and governor races, where he touted the new North American trade pact and claimed the U.S. was \u201cwinning very big\u201d in negotiations with China.\n\nTrade is likely to be on some voters\u2019 minds in key contests across the Midwest, where Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, and the retaliatory duties on U.S. ag products, are cutting into the bottom lines of ag and manufacturing operations. Florida\u2019s agriculture sector has been roiled, too, by trade challenges and severe weather in recent months.\n\nFlorida tomato growers, for example, warn they could be wiped out by cheaper Mexican imports \u2014 a topic that wasn\u2019t resolved in the new North American trade pact. (Produce growers in the state wanted the updated NAFTA to give them a mechanism to mount seasonal challenges to Mexico\u2019s practice of selling fruit and vegetables in the same season and at much lower prices than U.S. growers.) Retaliatory tariffs are hitting the state\u2019s prominent orange industry and other ag sectors, while Trump\u2019s duties are also weighing on U.S. companies.\n\nBy the numbers: New data from the Trade Partnership and Tariffs Hurt the Heartland \u2014 a joint project of Farmers for Free Trade and Americans for Free Trade \u2014 show Florida businesses in August paid $122 million in tariffs, a nearly 50 percent increase compared with August 2017. The monthly import tax totals have jumped steadily since April.\n\nAll eyes on Florida: Republicans and Democrats are bringing in the heavy hitters all week. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held a rally Wednesday for Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor, and former President Barack Obama will campaign for Democrats on Friday in Miami. Oh, and Trump is headed back to Pensacola on Saturday.\n\nTRADE TALK ON THE TRAIL: Here\u2019s a snapshot of what candidates are saying about trade in Midwest battleground states.

Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, a longtime oil and gas lobbyist, is well versed in the world of bureaucratic infighting, Pro Energy\u2019s Ben Lefebvre and Zack Colman write.\n\n\u2014 Are the midterms a lose-lose situation for budget compromise? Congress will be back in action for only a month before the next major spending deadline, and the sentiment on both sides of the aisle is that the end-of-year fiscal fight could get nasty under either electoral scenario: Democrats win the House, or the GOP keeps it. Pro Budget\u2019s Sarah Ferris has a good read for Pros here.\n\n\u2014 EPA sends biofuel blending rule to White House: The proposed rule would add 330 million more gallons of biodiesel in 2020 and calls for refiners to blend nearly 20 billion gallons of biofuel into the nation\u2019s fuel system next year. It\u2019s part of the Trump administration\u2019s push to allow fuel with 15 percent ethanol, known as E15, to be sold year-round. Pro Energy\u2019s Eric Wolff has the story.\n\n\u2014 Price hikes coming to parts of the food industry? U.S. companies are passing along higher costs to consumers, sensing that the consumer environment remains strong, The Wall Street Journal reports. Mondelez International, for instance, plans to raise prices in North America next year, citing rising costs for ingredients and transportation, among other factors.\n\n\u2014 Women (farmers) rule: Women make up 30 percent of farm operators in the U.S., but in 2017, female farmers out-earned their male counterparts.

Serving as California\u2019s insurance commissioner or state superintendent of public instruction lacks the high profile or policymaking capacity of senator or governor, but those races have evolved into big-budget proxy fights. Here\u2019s where voters stood:\n\n-- In the race to be California\u2019s top educator, charter schools ally Marshall Tuck registered a substantial 12-point lead (48 percent to 36 percent) over state Assemblyman Tony Thurmond, as Tuck takes his second shot at the position. In the insurance commissioner contest, Republican-turned-unaffiliated Steve Poizner has carved out a slimmer, five-point lead (49 percent to 44 percent) over state Sen. Ricardo Lara.\n\n-- The state superintendent race has attracted the most outside spending of any statewide contest, some $35 million: Teachers unions have showed up big for Thurmond, while rival EdVoice \u2014 whose campaign warchest is stocked by a small cast of individuals that includes Bill Bloomfield, Arthur Rock, Eli Broad, Richard Riordan and Jim Walton \u2014 have poured it on for Tuck. Both sides are saturating the airwaves; illustrating the stakes, the California Democratic Party just launched a $2.3 million ad blitz for Thurmond, and Sen. Kamala Harris appeared in a new pro-Thurmond ad .\n\n-- As for the insurance commissioner race \u2014 while Poizner is no longer a card-carrying GOPer, he still represents the best chance for conservatives to break the Democratic monopoly on statewide offices. Groups like the California Chamber of Commerce\u2019s PAC and realtors have spent on Poizner\u2019s behalf; labor is forking it over for Lara, along with Planned Parenthood. NARAL Pro-Choice California hit Poizner Wednesday for his stance on women\u2019s health care but so far hasn\u2019t spent much in the race.

Gavin Newsom and Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg emerged from the Newsom campaign bus in superhero costumes, Newsom wearing a Batman mask and cape, Steinberg going part-Superman, part-Clark Kent with a red cape and black-rimmed glasses.\n\n\n\n-- Though Newsom\u2019s Sacramento stop didn\u2019t involve a congressional or legislative candidate, he again talked about stumping and fundraising for down-ballot Democrats, emphasizing that it\u2019s all about turnout and that it would be a \u201chollow\u201d victory if he wins but the party falls short elsewhere. \u201cThe turnout opportunities are off the charts. Democrats, if we turn out, we win an overwhelming majority of these races. The problem is, historically, we haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\n-- Then it was all about policy. Newsom said, \u201cI\u2019m not profligate,\u201d when asked about the differences between him and Gov. Jerry Brown. Of his time as a San Francisco supervisor and mayor, Newsom said, \u201cI had to say no more often than I had to say yes. I was the proverbial adult in the room. We balanced budgets, we created our own rainy-day reserve.\u201d But Newsom said he\u2019d be more aggressive than Brown on homelessness, housing, early childhood education and worker training.\n\nTHE TRUMP ERA\n\n\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION CARD: A new campaign missive from the president seeks to stoke fears about illegal immigration by showing footage of Luis Bracamontes, who early this year was given the death penalty after killing Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver and Placer County sheriff's Detective Michael Davis Jr. Here\u2019s the video , and you can read some background on the Bracamontes case here .\n\n-- \u201cDCCC raises $100 million online in massive midterm haul\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Scott Bland: \u201cThe DCCC passed the nine-figure mark on Tuesday, one week out from Election Day, with an average donation of $19, according to a committee aide.

The single biggest independent expenditure buy was from the California Republican Party, which put up over three quarters of a million...to support Madera County Supervisor Rob Poythress. Democratic state Assembly member Anna Caballero has received support both from SEIU, which has spent $250,000 to boost her candidacy, as well as Californians for Jobs and a Strong Economy, a group that supports moderate Democrats, and the California Charter Schools Association Advocates.\n\n-- East Los Angeles County Senate District 22 - $5.4 million: The Democrat vs. Democrat race in SD22 (currently held by state Sen. Ed Hernandez), is attracting the most attention on the legislative side, with Baldwin Park City Councilmember Susan Rubio\u2019s supporters dominating on the spending side, accounting for $3.7 million of the total. State Assemblyman Mike Eng, primarily drawing support from organized labor, has benefited from $1.7 million in outside spending. See Pyers\u2019 full PDF report here.\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- SUPERMAJORITY WATCH: The key question this cycle is not whether Dems retain their majorities \u2014 you can count on that like snow in the Sierra -- but whether they safeguard their two-thirds margin in the state Assembly and regain it in the state Senate.

More than 30% of Californians spend over 50% of their paycheck on rent and utilities. As foreign tariffs fluctuate and new energy regulations mandate expensive and under-developed technologies, the livelihoods of millions of Californians are at risk. As a state that advocates sustainable energy for all, it is time to live up to this mission. California\u2019s diversity should not only reflect its people, but its energy strategy as well. An \u201cAll-of-the-Above\u201d energy mix, which blends every source of California-made energy including renewable sources such as wind and solar, and traditional sources such as oil and natural gas, is imperative to generate reliable and affordable energy. To be a true energy leader California needs to shift its dependence from foreign imports to secure locally produced energy.

The White House has sought to use anti-immigrant rhetoric to drive Trump's base of conservative voters to the polls, pointing to a caravan of asylum-seeking migrants making its way through southern Mexico and floating a long-shot executive order to end the practice of birthright citizenship.\n\nTrump in recent days has spread the unfounded conspiracy theory that the caravan has received financial support from Democrats, a claim that has taken root in right-wing circles. Trump has referred to the caravan as an \u201cinvasion\u201d and frequently implores the migrants to \u201cturn back\u201d and enter the U.S. \u201clegally\u201d despite the fact that seeking asylum at a U.S. port of entry, which the migrants say they plan to do, is legal.\n\nHe has claimed without evidence that the caravan, comprised largely of Central American migrants, includes \u201cthugs\u201d and \u201cgang members.\" He also told his Twitter followers that the caravan contained \"unknown Middle Easterners,\" a claim he later conceded he has \"no proof\" to support.\n\nHe took issue in his interview with Karl about reported size estimates of the caravan, which have varied widely from 1,000 to 10,000 people. The president told Karl he is \"pretty good at estimating crowd sizes,\" a point he has long fixated on in describing his own rallies and events. Trump's former press secretary, Sean Spicer, famously insisted that the crowd at the president's 2017 inauguration was the largest in history, despite clear photographic evidence to the contrary, reportedly at Trump's demand.\n\n\"You have caravans coming up that look a lot larger than it\u2019s reported actually,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good at estimating crowd size. And I\u2019ll tell you, they look a lot bigger than people would think.\u201d\n\nIn an interview released Tuesday in which Trump announced his intent to end the citizenship guarantee many say is settled law as part of the 14th Amendment, the president falsely claimed that the U.S. is the only country in the world with such a guarantee.\n\nWhen confronted with the fact that more than 30 countries also confer birthright citizenship \u2014 which in the U.S. means that a child born on U.S. soil is an American citizen regardless of his or her parents\u2019 citizenship \u2014 Trump said his \u201conly country\u201d remark was \u201cwhat I was told,\u201d according to Karl.", "\u201cYou know the word \u2018racist\u2019 is used about every Republican that\u2019s winning,\u201d President Donald Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. \u201cAny time a Republican is leading they take out the \u2018R\u2019 word, the \u2018racist\u2019 word.\u201d | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images white house Trump: Republicans attacked as 'racist' only because they're winning\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday pushed back against critics who have labeled him and others in the GOP as racist, telling an interviewer that such criticism is a sign that Democrats are growing desperate in their efforts to win back power in Washington.\n\n\u201cYou know the word \u2018racist\u2019 is used about every Republican that\u2019s winning,\u201d he told Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s Jenna Browder en route to a campaign rally in Florida. \u201cAnytime a Republican is leading, they take out the \u2018R\u2019 word, the \u2018racist\u2019 word. And I\u2019m not anti-immigrant at all.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump has long been accused of relying on racially charged rhetoric, especially in his push for more stringent immigration policies and tougher border security. He famously said the Mexican immigrants coming into the U.S. was made up, at least in part, of rapists, drug dealers and other criminals. On Wednesday, he posted a video on Twitter blaming Democrats for murders committed by an undocumented immigrant and suggesting that caravans of mostly Central American immigrants making their way toward the U.S. through Mexico includes other criminals.\n\nTrump also headlined a rally on Wednesday for Florida gubernatorial nominee Ron DeSantis, who is running against Democrat Andrew Gillum, an African-American, in a tight race teeming with racial tension.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But that messaging has been blunted somewhat by a recent spate of violence, seen by many as politically motivated, which has put new focus on the incendiary rhetoric used by the president about his political rivals and minorities.\n\nTrump on Wednesday maintained that migrant caravans making their way through Mexico with the goal of seeking asylum at the U.S. border pose a significant threat to the country, telling CBN \u201cthese are not angels.\u201d\n\nTrump cited reports that there was a skirmish between some of the migrants and authorities along Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala earlier this week that left Mexican police injured and said that he would be sending another surge of U.S. troops and military resources to the U.S.-Mexico border, though the migrants still have hundreds of miles to travel before they reach the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all for people coming into the country legally and people based on merit,\u201d Trump said, despite the fact that seeking asylum at at a U.S. port of entry, which the migrants say they will do, is a legal process.\n\n\u201cBut when you see a caravan that\u2019s pouring up to our country with thousands of people, maybe 10,000 people now, and then you see the violence that was caused by a second caravan that\u2019s forming on the northern Mexico side ... Look, we\u2019re not going to let them come into our country.\u201d\n\nEstimates on the size of the caravans vary, and one humanitarian group aiding the caravans told USA Today last week that the number had swelled to 10,000, though the size is expected to continue to drop off as the group makes its way through Mexico.\n\nTrump has rejected the notion that his latest anti-immigration push is an effort to score points with his base and get them to the polls next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWell if I am, I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time because I\u2019ve been on this issue for a long time, ever since you\u2019ve known me \u2014 and now we have a chance to do something about it,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump expressed confidence in the electoral prospects of the GOP next week, and he partly credited the issue of immigration for his optimism.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re just doing very well. There\u2019s a lot of feeling about the horrors of the illegal immigration problem, what people think they\u2019re just going to come into our country and take over our country? And it\u2019s just not going to happen.

It's the Republican Party's last bastion of power in state government, assuming the GOP doesn't score a breathtaking upset in one or more of November's statewide elections. The GOP is trying desperately to retain its one-member majority, while Democrats sense that this may be the year the chamber finally flips. Republicans have that slender majority thanks to Sen. Simcha Felder of Brooklyn, a Democrat who caucuses with the Republicans.\n\nYou haven\u2019t been paying super close attention to the Senate races so far? Don\u2019t know which races to watch on election night? Problem solved!\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPOLITICO analyzed the state of play in 11 competitive seats that we think are either toss-ups or leaning in one party\u2019s favor. The overall picture shows Republicans playing defense, thanks in part to several retirements and a possible increase in Democratic turnout because of President Donald Trump's unpopularity in his home state.\n\nFive of the races are toss-ups, according to our analysis, from Brendan Cheney and Bill Mahoney. Republican incumbents are retiring in two of those districts \u2014 the 39th, in the Hudson Valley, where Sen. William Larkin is packing it in after a long legislative career, and the 50th in central New York, where Sen. John DeFrancisco is retiring after an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for governor. President Donald Trump won the Larkin district in 2016 by 4 points but Hillary Clinton won the DeFrancisco district by 5 points.\n\nIn two other cases, Republican incumbents are holding on to seats in districts where Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and where there is considerable money flowing into the two races. Both are on Long Island: the 5th, held by Republican State Sen. Carl Marcellino, and the 7th, held by Republican Elaine Phillips.\n\nThe last toss-up seat is the 8th district on Long Island , currently held by Sen. John Brooks, a Democrat. Clinton won the district in 2016 by 3 points.\n\nThere are six other seats that are close but that we think are leaning Republican: districts 3 on Long Island, 22 in Brooklyn and 40, 41, 42, and 43 in the Hudson Valley. Clinton won two of these seats; Trump won the other four, but by 6 percentage points or less. Three of these are open seats.\n\nThere are no seats that are close but leaning Democrat. Instead there are 26 seats that we think are safe for the Democrats and four seats where we think the Democrat is likely to win, though an upset is possible. See our guide here. There\u2019s a handy, dandy map.\n\nIT\u2019S THURSDAY. And the first day of November. We will accept any candy corn you do not want. Got tips, suggestions or thoughts? Let us know ...

As of Monday, $31.6 million in outside money has flowed into congressional races in New York this election cycle, a 20 percent increase from the $26.4 million in outside money that was spent in 2016, according to Sludge\u2019s analysis of independent expenditure and campaign finance data collected by the Federal Election Commission, OpenSecrets and ProPublica. In the last midterm elections in 2014, outside groups spent $27 million on New York congressional races. This spending could affect the balance of power in the House, as Democrats attempt to pick up a handful of seats that are currently in Republican control in New York. Of the 27 districts, Democrats currently hold 17, while Republicans hold 9 seats primarily in upstate, Long Island and Staten Island. In total, nine congressional races in New York are considered competitive by Cook Political Report.\u201d [Sludge\u2019s Josefa Velasquez]\n\nWHAT CITY HALL IS READING\n\nDE BLASIO FORGETS TO HONOR TERROR VICTIMS, AT EVENT TO HONOR TERROR VICTIMS: \u201cA mourner at a memorial for the West Side Highway terror attack on Wednesday refused to shake Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s hand \u2014 after the city only let loved ones know about the event at the last minute. Hugh Hales-Tooke stared straight ahead and refused to acknowledge de Blasio\u2019s presence as Hizzoner stuck out his hand while greeting those gathered to grieve the eight people mowed down by a truck-driving terrorist on the pathway a year ago. Hales-Tooke said his friend Monica Missio, whose son Nicholas Cleves died in the massacre, missed the event because she was only told about it late Tuesday afternoon and was out of town. \u2018She\u2019s very hurt. She was very hurt,\u201d he told The Post. Adding insult to injury, de Blasio then forgot to read out any of the victims\u2019 names during his address at the service \u2014 despite managing to name-check all of the politicians who showed up. When family members objected after the memorial, the mayor returned to the podium to apologize for the faux pas.\u201d New York Post\u2019s Rich Calder and Ruth Brown\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe memorial came to an awkward halt when the mayor offered only a generic mention of the people killed. \u2018We lost good souls that day,\u2019 said de Blasio. \u2018New Yorkers and visitors alike, and we\u2019re here today to remember them, to mourn them\u2026\u2019But apparently not to mention them by name, at least not at first. The mayor wrapped up his remarks applauding first responders and made his way into the crowd to shake hands with the victims\u2019 families. Minutes later, after someone pointed out the oversight, de Blasio returned to the podium. \u2018I want to apologize,\u2019 he said. \u2018This should have been part of the gathering to read the names of the eight we lost, so I want to right that wrong and do that now so I\u2019d ask everyone to bow their heads as we do that now.\u2019 A representative from the mayor\u2019s office said tonight the program did not originally include a reading of the names, but when the families raised the issue, the mayor agreed and read the names.\u201d CBS2 New York\u2019s Jessica Moore\n\nGOLDEN PROUD OF HIS BOY: City Council Member Brad Lander chastised Brooklyn state Sen.

Council attorney Rob Newman has been assigned to the case, Johnson said. The speaker\u2019s interest in the veracity of Peters\u2019 testimony could signal more trouble ahead for the embattled investigations commissioner. A recent report concluded that Peters had overstepped his authority by trying to subsume the school watchdog into his own domain.

But if the former vice president passes? Mr. Cuomo could at least be tempted by a field he sees as less accomplished than himself. Still, most say it is hard to see him taking the plunge. For one thing, he craves control of every situation, gaming out moves and countermoves to cover all eventualities. Presidential campaigns are fundamentally uncontrollable. For another, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s dislike of the basics of retail politics has been a long-running joke among his campaign aides, past and present.\u201d NYT\u2019s Shane Goldmacher\n\nTHE LATE OCTOBER MONEY PICTURE: About $1 million in Independent expenditures were reported to the state Board of Elections on Tuesday and Wednesday; those funds have largely gone to the state Senate races that had already received the bulk of spending over the past month. The largest beneficiary was Republican Jeff Pravato, who is running against Sen. John Brooks in southern Long Island. He benefited from $318,000 in spending on ads from national Republican group Balance New York. That group also spent $75,000 helping Republican Tom Basile \u2014 on whom it had already spent over half a million \u2014 in a Newburgh-area district.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s Stronger Neighborhoods PAC, which had previously spent $459,000 aiding Basile\u2019s opponent James Skoufis, spent an additional $13,000 on mailings on his behalf. It has also begun to get involved in more races: In recent days, it has identified $54,000 spent on radio ads on behalf of Syracuse-area Democrat John Mannion, $50,000 apiece on television ads for Long Island Democrats Monica Martinez and Brooks and $44,000 in mailings for Buffalo Republican Chris Jacobs. Capital District Democrat Aaron Gladd, who has been at the receiving end of hundreds of thousands of dollars of attack ads in recent days, now has a super PAC working to support him.

In an interview with the Times Union editorial board on Wednesday, Molinaro said he doubts the U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 now more conservative with the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 would actually move to overturn the 1973 decision, Roe v.

His comments came Wednesday during meeting with the Democrat and Chronicle's Editorial Board to discuss the accomplishments of his two terms in office and his bid for re-election. In large part, however, the governor's hands are tied when it comes to education reform, as state law gives oversight of the system to the state Education Department and leaves the responsibility for developing the system largely to local communities. \u2018The only involvement I have with K-12 education is negotiating the budget and changing laws,\u2019 said Cuomo.\u201d [Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\u2019s Meaghan McDermott]\n\n\u201cArab Organizers in South Brooklyn Say: Yalla, Let's Unseat Marty Golden!\u201d \u2014 \u201dThis patch of South Brooklyn has long been considered a uniquely Republican stronghold, by New York City\u2019s standards, but the newly-kicked-up energy from Father K\u2019s [Rev.

Menendez\u2019s says Hugin will \u201cnever stand up to Trump.\u201d Hugin in his ad says \u201cI often hear, will you stand up to President Trump? The answer is yes.\u201d And on Tuesday, Hugin criticized Trump for \u201cinflammatory\u201d rhetoric on immigration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWe already know Menendez\u2019s problems that have made what should be a safe Democratic seat a pick-up opportunity for Republicans. The question is whether voters know \u2014 and how much they\u2019ll care \u2014 that Hugin was major financial backer for Trump, well after he had used inflammatory rhetoric on the campaign trail. Hugin gave more than $200,000 to Trump, a pro-Trump super PAC and the Republican National Convention despite having known that Trump had, for instance, called for a ban on Muslims entering the country. He served as a delegate for Trump at the Republican National Convention nearly a year after he made that statement. And there were, of course, many more inflammatory statements from the president.\n\nI asked Hugin spokesman Nick Iacovella if that was inconsistent with his current stance. He responded with another question. \u201cBob Menendez criticizes Bob Hugin and Celgene about the company's $280 million settlement and for \u2018gouging cancer patients\u2019 yet he accepted PAC money from Celgene as late as December 2017 \u2014 after the settlement. Seems inconsistent. Is that not the case?\u201d Iacovella wrote back.\n\nWhile you could say that\u2019s inconsistent, I don\u2019t think accepting one of dozens or hundreds of donations is the same as affirmatively giving hundreds of thousands of dollars. Regardless, it doesn\u2019t answer the question.\n\nHugin is asserting his independence from Trump now that he\u2019s running in a state where Trump is extremely unpopular. His latest ad could easily be mistaken for a Democrat\u2019s. Just as you can go and read countless clips about Menendez\u2019s corruption trial, you can read about Hugin\u2019s support for Trump before he had to worry about it as a political liability. But with Menendez being outspent and having to deal with so much of his own baggage, Hugin\u2019s history of supporting Trump may get lost in the noise.\n\nWHERE\u2019S MURPHY?

Phil Murphy himself. The company, Northstar New Jersey, followed a similar strategy several years earlier to win the long-term lottery contract under Republican Gov. Chris Christie. But a month after Murphy became governor, Northstar enlisted a lobbying firm that had formed a `strategic partnership\u2018 with Brendan Gill, the veteran Democratic strategist who had managed Murphy\u2019s campaign. Gill, president of the Essex County freeholder board, does not serve in Murphy's administration. And he is not a registered lobbyist. Yet he played an important role in the February meeting by suggesting that Northstar and its lobbyists from Public Strategies Impact meet with the governor's top lawyers. Gill has a financial agreement, described by him and the lobbying firm as a retainer, with Public Strategies \u2026 This new landscape is why campaign finance experts say there should be regulations. ... \u2018Lobbying has become a lot more sophisticated than it ever was. There\u2019s a lot more tools in the tool box,\u2019 said Jeff Brindle, executive director of the Election Law Enforcement Commission. \u2018These lobbying firms, particularly the wealthier ones, they can hire public relations people, which always softens the ground.\u2019\u201d Read the report\n\n\u2014\u201cThe documents: Emails show Brendan Gill's relationship with Gov.

Phil Murphy and legislative leaders continue to debate how to gradually raise the statewide minimum wage to $15 an hour, eight Democratic members of the state Assembly have put forth their own proposal. The bill, which Assemblywoman Britnee Timberlake (D-Essex) introduced this week, would raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2023 and not include exemptions, or so-called carveouts, for specific industries or groups of workers. Most Democrats \u2014 including Murphy, Senate President Steve Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin \u2014 generally agree on a $15 minimum wage and that it should be phased in over a period of years. However, there\u2019s been considerable disagreement over whether certain groups should be exempt. Murphy wants a bill free of carveouts, while Sweeney wants to exclude farm workers and teenagers, among others. Coughlin has said he is still assessing each potential carveout, although he has acknowledged that getting a proposal through the Legislature without any exemptions would be unlikely. Yet that\u2018s what Timberlake and her seven co-sponsors are hoping to do. Timberlake noted that someone making the current $8.60 minimum wage and working 40 hours a week has an annual income of just $17,888, before taxes.

At least one lawmaker says the latest allegations marring the Office of the State Comptroller's investigation into rampant Medicaid fraud in Lakewood deserves a closer look. \"We do have to look at it now that these issues have been raised. It would be irresponsible of us not to follow through,\" said state Sen. Declan O'Scanlon, R-Monmouth, who stopped short of calling for an official investigation by the Legislature.

A new report from S&P Global, one of the top Wall Street credit-rating firms, tracks some incremental progress for New Jersey\u2019s pension system but still ranks its funding ratio as second-to-last among all U.S. states. The Garden State also places dead last for progress on funding even the bare minimum of its growing pension costs, according to the S&P report. The firm\u2019s research \u2014 which did not carry with it any change to New Jersey\u2019s \u2018A-\u2019 credit rating \u2014 should not come as a surprise because the state routinely scores poorly in state-by-state rankings, thanks to years of underfunding by governors and lawmakers from both political parties.

But in a state rich with commuters and cul-de-sacs, party leaders are being forced to mount a last-minute, all-hands-on-deck effort to rescue Mr. Menendez\u2019s candidacy and preserve their long-shot dreams of a Senate majority. In New Jersey, many of the suburbanites who are backing Democratic House candidates from Republican-leaning areas are still uneasy about embracing Mr. Menendez after his 2017 federal corruption trial, which ended in a mistrial. And these voters have been reminded of that case most every day by a monthslong, $30 million ad campaign financed by Bob Hugin, a wealthy former pharmaceutical executive who is Mr. Menendez\u2019s Republican opponent \u2026 In Washington, Democrats grew increasingly alarmed when in mid-October their own internal polling indicated that Mr. Menendez\u2019s lead had fallen to only two points. Continuing to watch their scandal-tarred incumbent be outspent by seven to one was not a risk national Democrats were willing to take, especially given the prospect that they could take back the Senate in 2020 if they do not lose significant ground this year. So, perhaps grudgingly, the party\u2019s Senate super PAC began spending in a state where there are 900,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans.\u201d Read the report\n\nPUTTING IMMIGRATION ON ICE \u2014 \u201cGOP Spoiling for Immigration Fight, But Dems in N.J. Hold Their Punches,\u201d by WNYC\u2019s Matt Katz: \u201dForced separation of immigrant families. The door slammed on tens of thousands of refugees. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents looking for immigrants at courthouses, and soldiers looking for immigrants at the border. President Trump's immigration policies are so divisive they seem ripe for political exploitation by Democrats running tight races in swing districts. But in New Jersey, most of the time you hear congressional candidates mention immigration, they're Republicans. In the 11th district, Democrat Mikie Sherrill doesn't list \u2018immigration\u2019 as one of the 12 issues on her website. She hasn't tweeted about immigration since June. She blew off a chance to debate her opponent on immigration, and her spokesperson didn't respond to an email seeking her immigration platform. The reason may be the Democratic party perspective on how Sherrill can win a seat long held by a Republican in a mostly white, suburban district that narrowly voted for Trump. While child separation may be upsetting to Democrats, it is not a motivating factor for these voters. On the other side, however, the approaching caravan of immigrant adults and children from Latin America does motivate Republicans to the polls.\u201d Read the report\n\n\u2014The Menendez camp keeps pushing the idea that Bob Hugin left his job at J.P. Morgan in 1999 under shady circumstances. There is, of course, no evidence to support that (Imagine that: A campaign using unsubstantiated accusations to accuse its opponent of something sinister). This remind s me a bit of Harry Reid in 2012 baselessly claiming that Mitt Romney paid no taxes. Yesterday, Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-9th Dist.) wrote a letter to JP Morgan Chase\u2019s head of human resources asking her to release the U5 form that would presumably explain the reason for Hugin\u2019s departure. That probably won\u2019t happen. \u201cDue to Mr. Hugin\u2019s pursuit of high federal office, the facts surrounding Mr. Hugin\u2019s leadership role at a large financial institution are a matter of pressing public concern and public interest,\u201d Pascrell wrote. \u201cAs such, I respectfully request that J.P. Morgan release all relevant correspondence, information and any and all forms filed with your organization, and with FINRA and the Securities and Exchange Commission, in regards to Mr. Hugin\u2019s tenure and sudden departure from J.P. Morgan.\u201d Hugin himself could simply ask the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to release it, and put this to bed. If he did and it showed nothing of what the Menendez campaign is alleging, it wouldn\u2019t be a good look for Menendez. So if it really is simple for Hugin to get FINRA to release it, why not just do it? My colleague asked the Hugin campaign yesterday. We\u2019ll see.\n\nDONALD WHO? \u2014 MacArthur, Kim debate Trump policies, but steer clear of Trump, by POLITICO's Matt Friedman: President Donald Trump's policies, but not his name, dominated Tuesday night's debate in New Jersey's hotly contested 3rd Congressional District. The president's name was barely uttered, despite the fact Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur is Trump's biggest ally in the New Jersey delegation, and Democrat Andy Kim's candidacy has been boosted by the wave of anti-Trump anger that's swept the state's suburbs. \"I work with the president when I can, and when I disagree with him, say so,\" MacArthur, echoing a line both he and other New Jersey GOP candidates have repeatedly used, said during the debate, which was televised by NJTV. MacArthur's association with Trump has been front and center for the last two years. He authored the amendment that nearly saved the president's attempt to repeal Obamacare and was the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote for the Trump tax law. Trump, for his part, has headlined a fundraiser for MacArthur that raised almost $1 million. But despite MacArthur's deep pockets and ties to Trump, Kim has consistently outraised him in campaign cash.

Despite that precaution, scores of workers are killed at road projects each year. Across the country, 609 lost their lives at construction sites between 2011 to 2015, according to the federal Bureau of Labor statistics.

According to Issue One, 90 percent of House members have a leadership PAC, and only three sitting senators do not have one.\n\n\"Serve America PAC is about more than just cutting checks. Seth has aimed to recruit and inspire a new generation of leadership that will remain actively engaged in the Democratic Party,\" spokesman Matt Corridoni said in a statement to POLITICO.\n\nOn the giving side, Massachusetts-based defense contractor Raytheon ranked 12th among top donors to leadership PACs. The company has given close to $780,000 to 125 leadership PACs since last January. Broken down by party, 30 percent of that giving has been to Democratic PACs, and 70 percent was to Republican PACs, according to the report.\n\nTV AD BUYS SHOW LACK OF ACTION \u2014 If you've felt inundated by political ads on TV this month, it could be a lot worse. Boston only ranked 25th for political ad spending over the last 30 days, according to data compiled Tuesday by Advertising Analytics. It's a sign there's a lack of action on the ballot in Massachusetts, at least compared to other political hot spots. Las Vegas ranks number one, with more than $63 million in ad spending over the last 30 days \u2014 that's four times the spending in Boston. Nevada has competitive races for governor, the Senate and the House this cycle.\n\nIn Massachusetts, statewide challengers like gubernatorial hopeful Jay Gonzalez and GOP Senate candidate Geoff Diehl haven't exactly made huge TV ad buys. Gonzalez started advertising on television in the last couple of weeks, and Diehl opted to take out print ads in newspapers.\n\nThe Providence-New Bedford market was ranked 53rd over the last 30 days, with around $5.5 million in political ad spending. The Springfield-Holyoke market took in $1.3 million, ranking 124th on the list.\n\nBEACON HILL FORECAST \u2014 Things are heating up in races for the Legislature, but it looks like incumbents still hold the cards, according to elections data shared with POLITICO.\n\nThe race between GOP state Sen. Patrick O'Connor and Democrat Katie McBrine saw some movement yesterday when the new Priorities for Progress PAC announced it's spending $5,000 in digital ads against O'Connor, who is leading by 4 points according to a recent poll.\n\nAnd now the conservative Jobs First PAC is teeing up some digital ads critical of McBrine's support for safe injection sites leading up to election day. Jobs First Massachusetts Executive Director Andrew Goodrich told me the first ad buy will be $1,500, but the PAC is aiming to match Priorities for Progress' spending. McBrine's campaign manager Melissa Smith said it seems both PACs have decided to \"make some hay,\" though the campaigns have agreed to keep it positive.\n\nSo how will it all shake out? Carl Klarner, an academic and political consultant, forecasts McBrine, endorsed by President Barack Obama, will get 42.2 percent of the vote next week, and he says there is an 89.5 percent probability that O'Connor will win. Klarner modeled state-level races across the country using conditions measured Oct. 27 to Oct. 29. He used Bureau of Economic Analysis income data and presidential approval data, among other factors.\n\nIn Andover, Democrat Tram Nguyen has picked up endorsements from big names like Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Klarner forecasts Nguyen will get 42.4 percent of the vote, and that incumbent state Rep. Jim Lyons has an 88.7 percent chance of winning.\n\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

Charlie Baker, Boston Globe: \u201cWhen my brothers and I were young, my mom, a Democrat, and my dad, a Republican, used to lead freewheeling discussions at our dinner table. The only rule was paying attention when others were talking, and no interrupting. My parents cancelled each other out in most elections, but the back and forth around our table was a conversation, not a contest. They were both good listeners, and they expected the rest of us to be good listeners too. Their message was simple and clear \u2014 tough on the issues, and soft on the people .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cBump falls short of state\u2019s audit deadlines,\u201d by Colman M. Herman, CommonWealth Magazine: \u201cSTATE AUDITOR SUZANNE BUMP\u2019S office is legally required to audit 210 agencies every three years, but she has fallen short of that mark 29 times recently. Three cabinet-level agencies \u2014 energy and environmental affairs, housing and economic development, and labor and workforce development \u2014 were all supposed to be audited two-and-a-half years ago, but they haven\u2019t been done yet .\u201d\n\nON THE STUMP\n\n\u2013 \u201cOne race for governor \u2014 and two very different days in the campaign\u201d by Matt Stout, Boston Globe: Wrapped in a Red Sox sweatshirt, Governor Charlie Baker bounded up the Fenway Park riser Wednesday to gleefully recount the last out of the World Series. He mimicked Manny Machado\u2019s flailing, down-on-one-knee swing to a cheering crowd. \u2018It was awesome!\u2019 Baker exclaimed. Local TV stations carried the moment live. A few miles away at South Station, Jay Gonzalez stood outside. One hand stuffed inside a dark grey peacoat, the other extended outward, he greeted commuters trying to beat the dwindling walk signal. \u2018Hello, Jay Gonzalez,\u2019 he said introducing himself, a Republican party tracker training a lone handheld video camera at his back .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cGonzalez gets praise, flak for time as budget chief,\u201d by Joshua Miller, Boston Globe: \u201cIt was the summer of 2011. The state was still reeling from the Great Recession. Lawmakers had sent the governor legislation that would allow cities and towns, without drawn-out negotiations, to shift health care costs to employees and retirees. Unions were apoplectic. Cities and towns were dug in about the need for savings to avoid laying off workers. And Deval Patrick\u2019s budget chief, Jay Gonzalez, was assigned an unenviable task: Somehow, some way, get everyone on board .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cGeoff Diehl Says He Was Co-Chair Of Trump's Bay State Campaign. Was He?\u201d by Antonio Caban, WGBH News: \u201cGeoff Diehl, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, has long touted himself as the Massachusetts co-chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. He served as a convention delegate, volunteer and was an avid supporter of Trump. But Diehl\u2019s co-chair position with the campaign was honorary, with no independent management authority, and he didn\u2019t have any officially sanctioned role after the March 2016 primary was over, according to people who worked with the Trump campaign in New York .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cCharlie Baker says he\u2019s been tough on Trump when it matters. Is that enough for Mass. voters?\u201d by Matt Stout, Boston Globe: \u201cAs Baker seeks reelection to a second term, still hovering at the periphery of his political profile are questions about how he has responded to, navigated around, and truly feels about Donald Trump. Baker didn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2016, and said he doesn\u2019t intend to in 2020, either. He has criticized Trump\u2019s actions in sharp tones (\u201cdisgraceful\u201d) and mild ones (\u201cdisappointing\u201d). But in a state where many voters generally loathe Trump, is it enough? His challenger, Democrat Jay Gonzalez, says absolutely not; The state needs a fiercer fighter .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cWBUR Poll: Just Days Before Election, Baker Keeps Big Lead Over Gonzalez,\u201d by Steve Brown, WBUR: \u201cAs they prepare for their final gubernatorial debate Thursday night, incumbent Republican Gov. Charlie Baker continues to hold a sizable lead over Democratic challenger Jay Gonzalez. A new WBUR poll looking at the race finds Baker remains popular among Republicans and Democrats. When we asked 502 likely voters this past weekend who they intend to vote for, 68 percent said they're going with Baker, and that includes many Democrats.\u201d\n\nWARREN REPORT\n\n\u2013 \u201cHere\u2019s the deal with the ethics complaint filed against Warren that she calls \u2018frivolous,\u2019\u201d by Victoria McGrane, Boston Globe: \u201cDuring the race\u2019s final debate Tuesday, GOP Senate hopeful Geoff Diehl accused Democratic incumbent Elizabeth Warren of \u201cillegally\u201d fund-raising off the controversial confirmation vote for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Warren was caught off guard by the accusation and said she didn\u2019t know what Diehl was talking about. She said she\u2019d look into it. It turns out, a conservative group that calls itself the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, or FACT, filed a complaint Monday against Warren and Senator Kamala Harris of California for violating Senate ethics rules with fund-raising e-mails ahead of the final vote on Kavanaugh .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cWBUR Poll: Warren Keeps Big Lead As Voters Want A Senator Who Will Stand Up To Trump,\u201d by Fred Thys, WBUR: \u201cA new WBUR poll finds Sen. Elizabeth Warren maintaining a big lead over her Republican rival, state Rep. Geoff Diehl, in the 2018 race for her seat. The survey finds Warren leads Diehl 54 to 32 percent, with independent Shiva Ayyadurai polling at 6 percent. Warren drew a lot of criticism recently for releasing results of a DNA test that confirmed she has some American Indian ancestry \u2014 a claim she has long made .\u201d\n\nFROM THE HUB\n\n\u2013 \u201cIf \u2018Whitey\u2019 Bulger thought he was safe in W.Va. prison, he wasn\u2019t,\u201d by Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy, Boston Globe: \u201cWhen James \u2018Whitey\u2019 Bulger, the infamous octogenarian Boston gangster, arrived at his new prison digs in West Virginia on Monday, he was probably tired from his long trip from a transit stop in Oklahoma, but he wouldn\u2019t necessarily have been nervous. It\u2019s unclear whether US Bureau of Prisons officials who made the decision to transfer Bulger to the US Penitentiary Hazelton and place him in the prison\u2019s general population, despite a recent spate of violence there and complaints of chronic understaffing, were aware that Bulger should have been concerned .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cBoston Ballet project aims to lift women choreographers,\u201d by Lillian Brown, Boston Globe: \u201cIt\u2019s an issue as old as ballet itself: the lack of female choreographers in classical dance. Around the world, from the United States to England and Australia, it\u2019s true: While women choreographers have thrived in modern and contemporary dance, they remain strikingly rare on most major ballet stages. It\u2019s especially puzzling when women typically outnumber men among ballet dancers, from girls stepping gingerly in their first pointe shoes to the tutu-filled ranks of a professional corps de ballet. Where are the prominent women choreographers graduating from their ranks? The gender gap is starting to be addressed .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cMGH doctor says she was racially profiled on Delta flight to Boston,\u201d by Katie Camero, Boston Globe: \u201cDr. Fatima Cody Stanford was on Delta Flight 5935 flying from Indianapolis to Boston Tuesday night after a business meeting when the woman next to her started to convulse and hyperventilate. Stanford, an obesity medicine physician, scientist, educator, and policy maker at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said her first instinct was to figure out how best to help the passenger. But attendants on the plane questioned her identity and qualifications several times as she tried to calm down the woman, even after she showed them her medical license more than once .\u201d\n\nDAY IN COURT\n\n\u2013 \u201cFISCAL ALLIANCE LEAVES COURT WITHOUT INJUNCTION,\u201d by Matt Murphy, State House News Service: \u201cWith just days left until the 2018 elections, the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance left a federal courthouse Wednesday afternoon without an answer on whether it can air television ads this cycle without having to disclose its top five donors. The right-leaning non-profit has filed a lawsuit challenging donor disclosures and other advertising requirements that were part of 2010 and 2014 campaign finance laws .\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u201cSpringfield Police Officer Gregg Bigda's fall from grace punctuated by quiet courtroom, jazz music,\u201d by Stephanie Barry, Springfield Republican: \u201cOne of the most dramatic crises in the police department's recent history peaked in a quiet courtroom Wednesday, with instrumental jazz music piped cloyingly through overhead speakers. Tarnished Springfield Police Officer Gregg A. Bigda was arrested along with a former colleague earlier in the day. Bigda is charged with three counts of deprivation of civil rights and one count of filing a false report in an internal investigation .\u201d\n\nTHE TSONGAS ARENA\n\n\u2013 \u201cIn 3rd District, clear choices on campaign funds,\u201d by Chris Lisinski, The Lowell Sun: \u201cFor voters in the 3rd Congressional District, the Nov. 6 election is in many ways a referendum on how political campaigns are financed. Question 2 on the ballot, brought forth by a petition, proposes a commission aimed at limiting the role of money in politics. The area's congressional race, too, renders the debate in clear terms: each of the three candidates offers a different view .\u201d\n\nTHE CLARK CAUCUS\n\n\u2013 \u201cUnlikely Democratic House candidates are gaining momentum, even in GOP strongholds,\u201d by Jennifer Haberkorn, LA Times: \u201c\u2018The blue wave was never going to be double-digit wins. It was going to be close races tipping the way of Democrats,\u2019 said Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), vice chairwoman of recruitment for House Democrats. \u2018We always anticipated these would be tight races playing on a field where Democrats haven\u2019t been successful in a long time .\u2019\u201d\n\nABOVE THE FOLD\n\n\u2014 Herald: \u201cMOOKIE!\u201d Globe: \u201cTITLETOWN HAS THIS DUCKY THING DOWN,\" \"The mystery deepens: Why was Bulger left in harm's way?\" \"Criminal saga ends in a most unlikely place.\"\n\nTHE LOCAL ANGLE\n\n\u2013 \u201cWorcester Art Museum gets $600K grant to strengthen partnerships,\u201d by Prithvi G.

There is very, very little hedging among GOP insiders on this topic these days. So, with that in mind \u2026\n\n\u2026 We bring you THE PLAYBOOK DEMOCRATIC HOUSE STAFFER CHEAT SHEET. Here are the 13 STAFFERS you need to know (compiled by POLITICO Capitol Hill bureau chief JOHN BRESNAHAN, ANNA and JAKE):\n\n-- NANCY PELOSI: DREW HAMMILL, GEORGE KUNDANIS and DIANE DEWHIRST, deputy chiefs of staff. This trio of Pelosi aides has decades of experience in leadership. They help the California Democrat with her internal caucus politics as well as shaping her policy and communications strategy.\n\n-- STENY HOYER: ALEXIS COVEY BRANDT, chief of staff, and BRIAN ROMICK, deputy chief of staff. These are Hoyer\u2019s top two staffers, and they are intensely loyal to the Maryland Democrat. They help orchestrate Hoyer\u2019s caucus-wide operation.\n\n-- JIM CLYBURN: YEBBIE WATKINS, chief of staff. The longtime Clyburn staffer knows the Congressional Black Caucus better than just about anybody, and is always keeping an eye out for his boss\u2019 best interests.\n\n-- ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE: JAMIE FLEET, staff director. This key panel inside the Congress is charged with overseeing the management and operations of the House itself. The chairman of this panel is often called the \u201cmayor\u201d of Capitol Hill because they dole out everything from parking spaces to coveted office space.\n\n-- WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE: BRANDON CASEY, staff director. Taxes are going to be a huge issue for Democrats next Congress. Democrats have already said they will use the panel to seek President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\n-- APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE: SHALANDA YOUNG, staff director. Government spending is going to be a major battleground between Trump and the Democrats on all issues, but most notably the border wall.\n\n-- OVERSIGHT & GOVERNMENT REFORM COMMITTEE: DAVE RAPALLO, staff director. Armed with subpoena power, OGR, as it\u2019s referred to, will be the hotbed of investigations into the Trump administration. Rapallo -- a veteran of the Henry Waxman oversight committee -- will be at the center of all this.\n\n-- ENERGY & COMMERCE COMMITTEE: JEFF CARROLL, staff director. Democrats promise to push forward on an agenda that includes new initiatives to lower the cost of drug prices, which E&C will take the lead on.\n\n-- REP. JERROLD NADLER: AMY RUTKIN, chief of staff. If impeachment is on the table, it will come from the House Judiciary Committee. Rutkin is a pivotal player in Nadler\u2019s orbit.\n\n-- REP. BEN RAY LUJAN: ANGELA RAMIREZ, chief of staff. One of the top Democratic strategists in winning back the House, Ramirez will play a key role in Lujan\u2019s quest to move up in leadership.\n\nGood Thursday morning and happy November.

And I think we\u2019re doing very well. It looks like we\u2019re going to win the Senate, which is very important. \u2026 [T]he numbers reflect it as you know and I think we can do, I think we\u2019ll win the Senate, I think we\u2019re going to do well in the House.\u201d\n\nTHE COMING CLASH \u2026 IF DEMOCRATS do take the House, and Trump tries to change the Constitution through executive order, there\u2019s guaranteed to be a legislative clash on a must-pass government funding bill to stop this. There will be plenty of Republicans who would join with Democrats to buck Trump. Keep your eyes open for the Dec. 7 DHS funding deadline. It wouldn\u2019t surprise us at all if Democrats and some Republicans try to use that deadline to ensure that Trump can\u2019t change the birthright citizenship principle -- especially if he wants money for his border wall. Whether he knows it or not, the president just put a chip on the table for Democrats to use.\n\n-- TRUMP in Estero, Fla., per NYT\u2019s Katie Rogers: \u201cThe president referred to the citizenship clause in the Constitution as a \u2018crazy policy,\u2019 telling a rapt crowd that \u2018illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u2019 (Legal experts would widely disagree.)\u201d NYT\n\n-- TRUMP SPEAKS TO ABC\u2019S JONATHAN KARL: \u201c\u2018We have to have a wall of people,\u2019 Trump said, shortly after it was announced that they\u2019re going to send 10,000 to 15,000 troops to the border. In an exclusive interview with ABC Chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, Trump said that the caravan is bigger than is being reported, which he says he knows because of his own estimates.\n\n\u201c\u2018You have caravans coming up that look a lot larger than it\u2019s reported actually. I\u2019m pretty good at estimating crowd size. And I\u2019ll tell you they look a lot bigger than people would think,\u2019 Trump said.\u201d ABC\n\nA message from Delta Air Lines: Connecting armed service members with their loved ones while they undergo treatment and recovery is a small way to say thank you to the men and women who bravely serve us.

On Monday, officials announced that about 5,200 were being deployed. The next day, the Air Force general running the operation said more than the initially announced total were going, and he pointedly rejected a news report that it could reach 14,000, saying that was \u2018not consistent with what\u2019s actually being planned.\u2019\n\n\u201cGen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, the commander of U.S. Northern Command, told reporters the number would exceed the initial contingent of 5,200, but he offered no estimate of the eventual total. Just 24 hours later, Trump thrust new uncertainty into the picture, catching the Pentagon by surprise.\u201d AP\n\n-- TRUMP to Karl on telling the truth: \u201cWell, I try. I do try ... and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that\u2019s different or there\u2019s a change, but I always like to be truthful.\u201d\n\nThe most reliable politics newsletter.

Rick Scott joined Ron DeSantis on Wednesday night as he campaigned publicly for the first time next to President Donald Trump this year, ending a long spell when Florida\u2019s chief executive kept some distance from the man who had long encouraged him to run for U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cThe Scott-DeSantis rally with Trump in Fort Myers \u2014 the capital of one of the most politically engaged Republican counties in the state \u2014 highlighted the partisan nature of Florida\u2019s 2018 midterm election, in which both sides are ginning up their base voters with the two most popular figures in each party: Trump and former President Barack Obama, who visits Democrat-rich Miami on Friday. \u2018Is Southwest Florida Trump Country, or what?\u2019 DeSantis said when he took the stage to loud cheers.\n\n\u201cThe campaign event in the packed arena six days before Election Day showcased the classic hits of a Trump rally revival, replete with impromptu crowd chants of \u2018USA!\u2019 and \u2018CNN sucks!\u2019 and a new variant on an old theme: \u2018Lock him up!\u2019 \u2014 a reference to the federal investigation swirling around DeSantis\u2019 opponent in the gubernatorial contest, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.\u201d POLITICO\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES \u2026 SCALISE ARMY DEPLOYS \u2026 HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP STEVE SCALISE (R-LA.) will be in North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, New York and Kentucky today and tomorrow, visiting eight House Republican lawmakers and candidates: North Carolina Reps. Ted Budd, Richard Hudson and George Holding and candidate Mark Harris; Virginia candidate Denver Riggleman; New Jersey Rep. Tom MacArthur; New York Rep. John Faso; and Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr. LIZ CHENEY, the Wyoming Republican running for House GOP Conference chair, is traveling with him.\n\nSCALISE is sending staff to 10 districts to campaign. Senior Scalise aides Chris Bond, Lauren Fine, Ben Napier and Geoff Green are among those hitting the trail. In total, Scalise raised $5.4 million in October, hitting 17 districts in 10 states. He raised $4.2 million online.\n\n-- LAST PUSH FOR THE MAJORITY: Majority in Action, a PAC supported by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Scalise and Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), will deploy 115 GOP Hill staffers to 23 key districts to knock on doors from today until Election Day.\n\nTHE PAC raised $200,000 to send volunteers to front-line races that will determine the majority next year, including competitive districts in Arkansas, California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nMCHENRY will announce he has raised $5.8 million between his campaign committee and two PACs. He has given an additional $2.6 million to the NRCC and raised another $7.7 million for members, holding nearly 200 events.

Lynn Jenkins and nominated a political novice who has faced serious questions about whether he inflated his resume -- all the while facing an experienced Democrat who is raising far more money than his opponent.\n\n\u201cBut while a victory here could help flip the House to the Democrats -- and help make Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California the speaker again -- it also underscores the challenges for a party on the cusp of returning to power. Democrats like Davis are running away from their party's leader -- and may need to continue keeping their distance from their leadership to hold on to their seats in conservative districts.\n\n\u201cFirst, though, Pelosi will have to win the gavel -- without the support of Democrats like Davis. \u2018There isn\u2019t a circumstance in which I\u2019m going to support Pelosi,\u2019 Davis told CNN in Lawrence, Kansas. \u2018I think Democrats generally are going to have to figure out who\u2019s the candidate that can get to 218 votes.\u2019\u201d CNN\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S LAURA VOZZELLA in Richmond: \u201cDemocrat says Project Veritas infiltrated her campaign in Va.\u2019s tight 7th District\u201d: \u201cA conservative group that creates undercover \u2018sting\u2019 videos infiltrated the campaign of Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat in a tight race with Rep. Dave Brat in Virginia\u2019s 7th District.\n\n\u201cThe campaign said a young woman working for Project Veritas posed as a Democratic volunteer and spent every day over the past several weeks in Spanberger\u2019s suburban Richmond campaign office, performing basic office tasks \u2014 and peppering her office mates with questions that eventually raised red flags.

Fewer than a third, 31 percent, hold Democrats in Congress more responsible.

Donald Trump! But not just Donald Trump. Control of the Senate rests in part on what voters think of the president of the United States, but it will also be determined by local disputes and regional quirks\u2014demographics and issues, but also myth-making and self-conception. In this series of articles\u2014this is the seventh\u2014Politico Magazine asked an expert on a state with a crucial statewide race to explain what matters there that doesn\u2019t matter anywhere else.\n\nNorth Dakota handed President Donald Trump his fourth-largest margin of victory in the 2016 presidential election, making it the second-reddest state on the Senate map this cycle. But Democrats are surprisingly resilient when it comes to winning Senate races in the state. For a Republican state, North Dakotans sure love to send Democrats to Washington.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor more than two decades, two Democrats\u2014Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad\u2014won statewide races by double-digit margins. From 1980 until 2010, Democrats also held the state\u2019s only House seat every cycle. Then in 2010, Republicans took a Senate seat and the House seat for the first time in 30 years. It seemed like the beginning of a significant shift. Yet just two years later, in 2012, Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp defied polls and eked out a narrow 1-point victory over Republican Rep. Rick Berg. Even as North Dakota has moved further to the right, Heitkamp hopes to repeat her feat in the race against Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer this year.\n\n\u201cI've always thought because North Dakota leans Republican, that if you're a Democrat, you've got to be able to demonstrate that you can get results for your state,\u201d Conrad says. \u201cThat is the critical component of winning elections, showing that you can deliver. A Republican, they can sometimes get by just because an R is next to their name. But even that doesn't last very long.\u201d\n\nNorth Dakota is the only state that doesn\u2019t require voter registration. That independent streak makes the state notoriously difficult to poll, and it amplifies how much the state\u2019s politicians rely on individual voter connections. North Dakotans point to Heitkamp\u2019s first win six years ago to make the point: She trailed in every public poll in October, including by 10 points in one survey, but won by a point.\n\n\u201cWe're a small town with really long streets,\u201d Republican Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford says of the state (he credited Gov. Doug Burgum for the phrase). With so few voters, most residents know the politicians by first name, he said, and expect them to be readily available.\n\nDespite its geographic breadth, North Dakota\u2019s population is just over 755,000, about the size of most congressional districts. Fewer than 350,000 votes were cast in 2016. In 2010, the last time the state had a Senate race during a midterm year, just 238,812 votes were cast.\n\nThe majority of votes in North Dakota sit in a cluster of several counties with large cities: Fargo, in Cass County; Bismarck, in Burleigh County; Grand Forks, in Grand Forks County; and Minot, in Ward County. But according to Conrad, who won five Senate races in North Dakota, the state doesn\u2019t quite follow the national pattern of a clear divide among urban, suburban and rural voters.\n\n\u201cEast and West Coast urban areas have a different experience, a different life experience, than people in rural areas,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cThat is less true in North Dakota.\u201d He went on, \u201cI never targeted specific parts of the state. I never thought that was a winning strategy.\u201d\n\nThe homogeneity among the state\u2019s rural areas and its urban centers helps to explain Democrats\u2019 success in the state, says Tyler Axness, a former Democratic state senator who now hosts a radio show based in Fargo. But he said as the national Democratic Party shifted left, it has become harder for local Democrats to disassociate themselves from the brand, especially outside the cities. Axness said it wasn\u2019t uncommon to encounter voters who agreed with him on 80 percent of issues but wouldn\u2019t back him because of his party affiliation.\n\nStill, when it comes to voting patterns, the urban-rural divide is pronounced. Most of the populous counties that lean Democratic are on the eastern border of the state, while the western half is dominated by Republican voters. Democrats have only nine of the 47 state Senate seats this year, and only 13 of 94 state House seats, most of which are clustered near Fargo or Grand Forks. There are no Democratic state lawmakers west of the suburbs of Bismarck, near the state\u2019s geographical center.\n\nCass County is particularly critical for statewide elections. Home to Fargo, it\u2019s both the most populous county in the state and also the most fertile ground for Democrats. Heitkamp won the county by a 14-percentage-point margin in 2012, collecting 41,480 votes, almost exactly one-quarter of her total in the state.\n\nFargo\u2019s population leans younger and more educated than the rest of the state. The Fargo economy is high tech, focused on advanced agricultural manufacturing, and it\u2019s also the state\u2019s transportation hub, according to Sanford, the lieutenant governor. Axness said Fargo is also increasingly populated with young professionals who lean Democratic.\n\nIn 2008, when President Barack Obama lost the state by 9 percentage points, he won Cass County by 7 points. In 2012, when Obama lost North Dakota by 20 percentage points, he lost the county by 3 percentage points. His 10-point drop-off in Cass County nearly perfectly mirrored his drop-off statewide.\n\nSecond to Cass stands Burleigh County, the home to state capital Bismarck, a Republican-rich area. (Because Republicans have near total control of the state government, the capital city is populated with GOP officials.) Berg won Burleigh by 10 percentage points over Heitkamp in 2012, but the Republican margin matters significantly. In 2012, Berg won in Burleigh by only 4,254 votes, significantly less than his 8,761-vote margin two years earlier, when he carried the state on his way to the House of Representatives\u2014and significantly less than the almost 12,000-vote margin in 2012 for Cramer, when he won his House race easily.\n\nFargo isn\u2019t Democrats\u2019 only stronghold. Another vital area is Grand Forks County, on the eastern edge of the state. Heitkamp won here over Berg by 11 percentage points in 2012 even as the other statewide Republicans carried the county by narrow margins. In 2010, when Berg won his House race statewide, he lost Grand Forks by only 6 points.\n\nLast among the major population centers is Ward County\u2014home to Minot, also a Republican-rich area. Berg won there by 2,658 votes, or 10 percentage points. But again, he underperformed compared with his 18-percentage-point win in the county two years earlier. Cramer won it by more than 5,000 votes and Mitt Romney, when he was the Republican presidential candidate in 2012, won it by nearly 8,000.\n\nHigh Republican turnout and a strong margin of victory in Burleigh and Ward Counties can counterbalance a Democratic surge in Grand Forks and Cass Counties. Home to the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State University, the state\u2019s two largest colleges, Grand Forks and Cass are younger, more educated and generally more liberal. In Heitkamp\u2019s 2012 win, those four counties represented 55 percent of her total votes in the state. Heitkamp\u2019s best hope is a massive swell of turnout, coupled with a double-digit margin, over Cramer in Fargo and Grand Forks.\n\nFor Republicans, it\u2019s critical to limit the margin of loss in Barnes, Richland, Trail and Walsh counties\u2014four small collar counties that neighbor Fargo and Grand Forks and contain suburban voters. \u201cThose aren't huge in population but have enough to make a difference,\u201d a Republican operative with experience in multiple statewide races in North Dakota told POLITICO.\n\nThe counties in the eastern portion of the state\u2014particularly along the Minnesota border, and in the southeast corner\u2014handed Trump and Romney their lowest margins of victory, and Heitkamp won nearly every county in the eastern third of the state in her first election. She won only three western counties, and her largest margin of victory there was 2 percentage points. There simply aren\u2019t enough Democratic votes in the western half of the state to make up for any underperformance in the population-dense areas in the east. \u201cRepublicans need to really run up margins in the western half of the state,\u201d the GOP operative said.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s population has boomed this decade, growing by 12 percent (almost 83,000 people) from 2010 to 2017. Of that growth, about two-thirds was in the four populous counties. In a state where one-on-one voter contact is expected, outreach to new voters becomes even more critical.\n\nAlthough those new residents live in Heitkamp\u2019s geographical base, they are likely to be Republican voters, said Sanford, the lieutenant governor. Much of the population growth stemmed from the massive boom in oil production in the past decade, which drew people from other oil-producing\u2014and Republican\u2014states like Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Many of the oil workers, however, weren\u2019t permanent residents initially, and so it isn\u2019t clear whether the population growth led to a growth in North Dakota voters. (There\u2019s no voter registration, remember!)\n\nThe state\u2019s economy is massively dependent on energy and agriculture\u2014two industries that can divide the state. Though both issues are important across the state, agricultural interests are more prevalent in the east, while the energy sector is clustered in the western half of the state. North Dakota is the second-largest crude-oil producer in the nation, and has significant renewable energy resources. The state also ranks among the top soybean and wheat producers, among a collection of other crops. Veterans issues are also critical: The state has a sizable veteran population, and both Minot and Grand Forks are home to Air Force bases.\n\nOil and gas extraction accounts for close to half of the state\u2019s tax revenues, while agriculture still accounts for the majority of the state\u2019s gross domestic product, Sanford said.\n\n\u201cThe thing you'll hear in the legislature more than anything, more than partisan differences, is we can't have an east versus west battle,\u201d he added.\n\nDemographically, nearly 90 percent of the state is white, which means the power of each minority voting bloc is extremely limited. The largest is Native Americans, who make up about 5 percent of the state\u2019s population. There are five reservations at least partially geographically in North Dakota. Native Americans represent a critical voting bloc: Sioux County and Rolette County\u2014the only two counties Hillary Clinton won in the state in 2016\u2014both have populations that are more than 75 percent Native American.\n\nA new voter ID law implemented for the first time this year\u2014and upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this month\u2014requires a street address to vote. Many residents on reservations use post office boxes to collect mail rather than permanent street addresses, potentially limiting their ability to vote this fall. The Associated Press reported last week that tribes were scrambling to get full identification for voters, including handing out free IDs and hosting a Dave Matthews concert on Standing Rock reservation to draw attention to the change in law. One tribal leader told ABC News the law could potentially galvanize Native American voters, increasing turnout. Any small change in either direction could be significant.\n\nFor now, Cramer holds the inside track to a promotion from the House to the Senate, as he leads most public polls by a comfortable margin. But North Dakota\u2019s infamous polling errors loom large.\n\nSix years ago, a grinning Heitkamp stood in front of a large American flag and held a copy of the Fargo Forum with a headline touting Berg\u2019s 10-point lead in the race, her personal \u201cDewey Defeats Truman.\u201d If Heitkamp pulls off another improbable victory next week, she will surely have her choice of headlines to restage the triumphant moment once again.", "For Donald Trump, \u201celite\u201d used to mean a modeling agency. \u201cShe was with Elite,\u201d he said of Anna Nicole Smith four days after her death in 2007 in an interview with Howard Stern, the same way some might say a person had won a prestigious prize. \u201cShe had the best body. She had the best face. She had the best hair I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nIn his long career as a celebrity businessman, Trump used the world \u201celite\u201d the way the agency did, as a bit of marketing boilerplate more or less interchangeable with \u201cclassy\u201d or \u201cluxury.\u201d Trump\u2019s golf courses were \u201celite.\u201d His buildings, in New York or Toronto, in Panama or Las Vegas, were \u201celite.\u201d Mar-a-Lago was \u201celite.\u201d Applied to people, it was an unvarnished compliment: Eli Manning was an \u201celite\u201d quarterback.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis, however, changed abruptly in the summer of 2015. When Trump started running for president, \u201celite\u201d no longer was a thumbs-up affirmation. He had followed politics long enough to understand that it meant something else when said in front of a red-meat Republican crowd. \u201cThe elites want Common Core,\u201d he tweeted not long after he announced his bid, \u201cso they can take education out of parental control. NO!\u201d He stopped using the word only as a compliment. In interviews and speeches at rallies, as his campaign gathered momentum, the steady target of his ire was the establishment and its even more suspect inner circle: \u201cmedia elites,\u201d \u201cthe political elites,\u201d \u201cthe elites who only want to raise more money for global corporations,\u201d \u201cthe elites who led us from one financial and foreign policy disaster to another.\u201d Hillary Clinton, he said, hammering away at starkly sketched lines, \u201cstood with the elites.\u201d In this, the otherwise unorthodox candidate was adopting a time-tested populist tactic, an insult used to great effect by such political notables as Huey Long, George Wallace, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. It even served as one of the linchpins of Trump\u2019s closing argument. \u201cIt is time,\u201d he told a crowd in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the day before the election in 2016, \u201cto reject a failed political elite.\u201d\n\nBut then he won. And over the past year, as he has settled into the trappings of the presidency, he has begun to do something none of his populist forebears ever attempted. He has been reclaiming the word \u201celite\u201d with an almost vengeful pride. Having vanquished his opponents at the polls, having slammed the \u201celites\u201d as corrupt, incompetent and out of touch, Trump now has bestowed upon himself, as well as his most fervent supporters, the mantle of \u201celite\u201d as if it were a spoil of war. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he said last year in Arizona. \u201cI think we\u2019re the elites.\u201d In recent months, this approach has ramped up markedly. \u201cWhy are they elite?\u201d he said in Minnesota. \u201cI have a much better apartment than they do. I\u2019m smarter than they are. I\u2019m richer than they are. I became president, and they didn\u2019t. And I\u2019m representing the greatest, smartest, most loyal, best people on earth\u2014the deplorables.\u201d He and his voters are now the elite, the new elite, \u201cthe super-elite,\u201d Trump said in South Carolina. \u201cJust remember that,\u201d he said in West Virginia toward the end of the summer. \u201cYou are the elite. They\u2019re not the elite.\u201d\n\nThis Trumpian rebranding is more than mere semantic sleight of hand. It is a true novelty in politics, and a window into the source of his power. \u201cThe phenomenon of the Trump voter is twofold,\u201d veteran Republican consultant and pollster Frank Luntz told me. \u201cHalf of the people felt forgotten. And half of the people felt fucked. I call it F-squared.\u201d The \u201cF-squared\u201d portion of the population was the key to his victory. It continues to contribute to his sway over members of Congress. And it will help determine, one way or another, his fortunes in the next two years and maybe beyond. \u201cTrump,\u201d Luntz explained, \u201cis seeking to elevate those who feel oppressed by and taken advantage of by the elites, and he seems to raise them up and say, \u2018Hey, guys, you\u2019re now in charge. \u2026 You matter.\u2019\u201d And now Trump is upping the ante. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the last time that someone ran for president championing being the elite,\u201d Luntz concluded. \u201cThis is truly groundbreaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon of the Trump voter is twofold. Half of the people felt forgotten. And half of the people felt fucked. I call it F-squared.\u201d Frank Luntz\n\nMany have noted the sheer implausibility of a plutocrat stepping out of his chauffeured limousine, or off his private plane, and making common cause with some of America\u2019s most down-and-out voters. But Trump always has felt an intense antagonism for what he sees as a privileged class of Americans, and particularly New Yorkers, who long mocked his outer-borough origins and sniffed at his signature achievements. And this in turn has made him an especially savvy combatant in the culture wars. His gut appeal to voters has nothing to do with the big ideas that have energized the right and the left\u2014like morality or personal freedom\u2014and it isn\u2019t even a matter of dollars and cents. His acrobatic use of \u201celite\u201d is not some cynical political contortion but precisely the opposite. Trump\u2019s abiding sense of grievance, his unconcealed mix of envy and resentment of this class of person, constitutes an unmistakable point of consistency in his character.\n\nFrom Elite, to Anti-Elite Crusader, Back to Elite Donald Trump\u2019s comments about elites over the years map out a journey of identity, with two key inflection points. 2006 \u201cI want you to become part of an elite wealth building team that works under my direction. Trust me, you are going to want to be part of this team.\u201d In a pitch email for Trump University. September 17, 2012 \u201cEli Manning staged a great comeback in 4th quarter--an elite quarterback.\u201d On Twitter. October 16, 2012 \u201cI was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment\u2014I agree.\u201d On Twitter. November 2, 2012 \u201cIn the heart of the city, Trump International Toronto is the city\u2019s most elite property.\u201d On Twitter.

August 21, 2013 \u201cMar-a-Lago in Palm Beach is one of the most exclusive & elite clubs in the world w/award winning amenities.\u201d On Twitter.

May 21, 2015 \u201c@TrumpNationalNY is Westchester\u2019s most elite club.\u201d On Twitter.\n\nContinued below\u2026\n\n\u201cIt betrays this Janus-faced quality that\u2019s deeply embedded in President Trump, which is that he alternately disparages elitism but also wants to be a member of the club. \u2026 He had every reason not to feel like an outsider \u2026 and yet he feels that in his bones all the time. And then he articulates it. And that\u2019s why a good chunk of the electorate responds to him,\u201d biographer Tim O\u2019Brien said in an interview.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d O\u2019Brien added, \u201cone of the very few authentic things about him.\u201d\n\nIt has been said that nothing gave Trump more pleasure than accepting Clinton\u2019s concession call on election night. Finally, he had irrefutable proof that he was better than all the gatekeepers who had ever found him lacking. As the 45th president, he is now a member of one of the most exclusive clubs in the world, and his daily occupation of the White House is a fundamental rebuke to the many people who view him as unfit for the job. The longer Trump holds it, the more his standards become norms of their own. He already has remade the Republican Party in his image, and he continues to turn campaign rhetoric into policy reality; in early October, headlines announced the replacement of the North American Free Trade Agreement with a rejiggered trade deal of Trump\u2019s own naming. Is Trump, the master of reinvention, also now turning a lifelong grudge into a radical redefinition of what it means to be elite in American society?\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn late 1985, when Donald Trump paid a headline-worthy $7 million to buy the Mar-a-Lago estate in tony, old-money Palm Beach, Florida, word was he didn\u2019t receive an invitation to join the ultra-exclusive Bath & Tennis Club, known in local society simply as the B&T. \u201cUtter bullshit!\u201d Trump bellowed in 1990 in Vanity Fair. Perhaps, but the talked-about slight was still on his mind a decade and a half later. Tooling about town in his red Ferrari with O\u2019Brien riding shotgun, Trump railed at the rumors. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI have a better club than them.\u201d He called Mar-a-Lago \u201cmuch bigger.\u201d\n\nIt was the South Florida version of what had already happened to Trump in New York, as the Queens-born real estate heir tried desperately to crack the Manhattan social scene and found himself scorned and shunned by the tastemakers, the philanthropists, the lovers of culture and art, even his would-be peers, the top people in the real-estate business. He was \u201ctoo tawdry\u201d for them, according to Gwenda Blair, another Trump biographer. \u201cMany of the developers believed that his ego was out of control,\u201d said George Arzt, who was an aide to former New York Mayor Ed Koch. Trump, for his part, again claimed he had never wanted any part of it. \u201cIn my opinion, the social scene\u2014in New York, Palm Beach, or anywhere else, for that matter\u2014is full of phonies and unattractive people,\u201d Trump told O\u2019Brien in 2005.\n\nThe roots of Trump\u2019s resentment of elites run even deeper than that. His father, a wealthy and established builder whom Trump admired profoundly, forever had felt like an outsider. The son of an immigrant, Fred Trump was German at a time when that wasn\u2019t helpful; for decades, he insisted that he was actually Swedish. He was Presbyterian when most of his competitors were Jewish. He was awkward and shy, and the vast wealth he acquired building homes and apartments in Brooklyn and Queens did little to alter this mindset. He forged ties with the boroughs\u2019 Democratic political establishment for business reasons, but his personal politics tended toward the anti-elite; he was, by 1964, a supporter of the outsider Republican Barry Goldwater.\n\nIf Fred Trump was the first important influence on Donald Trump, Roy Cohn was the second. And Cohn, notorious for his role as red-baiting Senator Joe McCarthy\u2019s scowling chief counsel in the 1950s, had managed by the \u201970s to master an inimitable insider-outsider straddle. He called himself \u201can iconoclast\u201d and pooh-poohed the \u201cstuffed-shirt\u201d elite, all while being driven around in a Rolls-Royce and living and working in an Upper East Side townhouse. \u201cCohn\u2019s position in the culture was such that he could scorn the establishment from one side of his faux-populist, pro-little guy mouth even as he suckled the power structure from the other,\u201d journalist Tom Gogola once wrote, \u201cand get away with it again and again.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted to be part of [the New York society elites], but because he was not, he hated them.\u201d Jack O\u2019Donnell\n\nTrump was Cohn\u2019s prize pupil. And in the ensuing two decades in midtown Manhattan, Trump turned the old Commodore Hotel into the new Grand Hyatt and built Trump Tower and fixed Wollman Rink when the government could not\u2014consistently hawking himself as a magnanimous savior of the city. This made headlines around the country, but miffed the people who mattered the most in New York. With the Grand Hyatt, he extracted an unprecedented tax cut from a financially struggling city; with Trump Tower, he jackhammered valuable friezes off the face of the building it replaced even after he had promised to donate them to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He then used a series of Cohn-coordinated appeals to win another lot of public subsidies for Trump Tower; and with the skating rink in Central Park, he relished ribbing Koch and his administration, turning it into a tidy tale of private enterprise over public-sector incompetence. Unquestionably successful though the project was, the never-ending series of self-congratulatory press conferences rubbed people (and not just in the mayor\u2019s office) the wrong way, especially coming from a guy who owed as much as he did to government assistance. \u201cI think that\u2019s where people lost patience,\u201d a former Trump associate told me.\n\nNew York society never warmed to him. Jack O\u2019Donnell, a former Trump casino executive, always thought of it as a love-hate relationship, and a veritable engine of his existence. \u201cHe wanted to be part of them,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said, \u201cbut because he was not, he hated them.\u201d In his efforts to build a so-called Trump City, he tangled for the rest of the 1980s with the Upper West Side\u2019s resident intellectual elite, who found him unbearably \u201cboorish,\u201d according to Ruth Messinger, the neighborhood\u2019s liberal city councilwoman at the time. And he kept putting his name on everything he built or bought, \u201clike a barbarian marking what he had seized,\u201d in the words of New York University urban policy and planning professor Mitchell Moss.\n\nPivot 1 July 9, 2015 \u201cThe elites want Common Core so they can take education out of parental control.

November 7, 2016 \u201cIt is time to reject a failed political elite that has bled this country dry.\u201d At a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nContinued below\u2026\n\nAs Trump continued knocking on the door and finding it closed, he came to realize\u2014grudgingly, say people who worked for him\u2014that he was much more admired and accepted by another set of people, the kinds of Americans whom Hillary Clinton later would label \u201cdeplorables.\u201d Some 130 miles south of New York, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, flanked by bodyguards, he paraded through the lobbies of his three casinos\u2014Trump Plaza and Trump Castle and the Trump Taj Mahal. The small-time gamblers who flocked there on cut-rate buses wanted to shake his hand, or just rub him for luck. \u201cIt was always very interesting to watch,\u201d recalled O\u2019Donnell, the casino exec, \u201cparticularly knowing that he really despised them. He hated it when they touched him.\u201d\n\nOften, O\u2019Donnell said, after these theatrical sweep-throughs, Trump beelined to the bathroom to wash his hands. \u201cThe first thing he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was disgusted by his customers,\u201d a former Trump Organization higher-up told me. \u201cHe would say, \u2018Can you believe these are the people I make my money with?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut they were the ones who loved him, and Trump nurtured that love by publicly disparaging the caste of people he so wanted to impress. \u201cPerhaps the most important thing I learned at Wharton,\u201d he wrote in his 1987 book The Art of the Deal, referring to the business school of his Ivy League alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, \u201cwas not to be overly impressed by academic credentials. It didn\u2019t take me long to realize that there was nothing particularly awesome or exceptional about my classmates.\u201d An avid country club golfer, he still hosted at his casinos the decidedly more lowbrow sports of boxing and professional wrestling. While he once considered reality television so much pap for \u201cthe bottom-feeders of society,\u201d according to Trump Revealed, he used \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d to present himself to that very audience as an uber-successful and omnipotent corporate titan. Forgoing \u201cpheasant under glass,\u201d as he once dubbed fancy fare, he preferred hamburgers, meatloaf and well-done slabs of steak slathered in ketchup.\n\n\u201cHe could never be old money,\u201d Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization vice president who started working for him in the late 1970s, told me. \u201cHe could never be the kind of people who were into museums and art and opera, things like that. He could never, ever be that. And he wanted it, and he resented it, and then he played upon it\u2014and then he said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m better than that, my elite is better than the old elite.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat he lacked was a way to prove it.\n\n\n\n***\n\nTrump glided down the gilded escalator in his midtown tower in June 2015, in the estimation of Moss, the NYU professor, because \u201calmost no one admired or deferred to him in New York City.\u201d\n\nAs angrily personal as his motivation might have been, Trump\u2019s campaign also tapped into a deep American history of anti-elitism as a potent political tool. Huey Long, the force-of-nature governor and United States senator from Louisiana in the 1920s and \u201930s before his assassination in 1935, railed against oil companies, big banks and utilities and denounced the wealthy as \u201cparasites\u201d who gorged themselves at the expense of the poor. More than 30 years later, George Wallace, the racist Alabama governor and presidential candidate, saw himself as \u201cthe very incarnation of the \u2018folks,\u2019\u201d wrote biographer Marshall Frady, \u201cthe embodiment of the will and sensibilities and discontents of the people\u201d\u2014a new user of \u201cLong\u2019s coalition of frustration.\u201d Reagan injected into the equation the actual word \u201celite\u201d in 1964, 16 years before he was elected president. In his speech in Los Angeles in support of Goldwater\u2014\u201cA Time for Choosing\u201d\u2014he launched his political career and gave the culture wars a fresh lexicon, \u201cpitting a supposedly indignant Middle America against the liberal snobs of the coasts,\u201d as Yale history professor Beverly Gage has written.\n\nIt was Nixon, of course, who made all this stick as a national candidate, running and winning on an anti-elitist resentment four years later. \u201cHe had a gift for identifying, from his own personal prejudices, the gnawing sense of grievance in others,\u201d Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell told me. \u201cNixon\u2019s whole life was a chip on his shoulder,\u201d presidential historian Doug Brinkley said in an interview. For Nixon, it was a formula for success; for others, it offered a road map. \u201cNixon\u2019s anti-elitism,\u201d Farrell pointed out, \u201cwas a foundational element of modern Republican populism\u201d\u2014and, some would add, its various offshoots, from Ross Perot to Pat Buchanan to Sarah Palin to \u2026 Trump.\n\nTrump met Reagan, but he knew Nixon. In the 1980s, they were both regular guests in the Yankee Stadium suite of team owner George Steinbrenner. They had a mutual confidant in political operative Roger Stone. \u201cYour man\u2019s got it,\u201d Nixon told Stone, sensing Trump\u2019s political potential, Stone wrote in his book, The Making of the President 2016: How Donald Trump Orchestrated a Revolution. \u201cTrump was intrigued by Nixon\u2019s understanding of the use of power.\u201d In 1989, Stone helped organize a weekend meeting in Houston, where Trump and Nixon holed up in a hotel room and talked for hours. Nixon, according to Stone, was \u201cdownright impressed.\u201d Trump, meanwhile, \u201cabsorbed as much as he could.\u201d In Trump, Nixon saw a provocative, room-filling presence. In Nixon, Trump saw a kinship in their disdain for elites.\n\nHeading then into 2015, and given his past, Trump needed no tutorial on the politics of resentment. \u201cNo. He got it,\u201d former political aide Sam Nunberg told me, recalling his conversations with Trump in the two or three years leading up to his candidacy. \u201cWe talked about us versus them. Populism. Going for low-income, working-class voters, non-college-educated voters. Going against the system.\u201d\n\nNow, though, Trump is doing something different from his predecessors. He has embraced the notion of a populist revolution without renouncing a single trapping of his gold-plated lifestyle. Can he really run as the elite instead of against the elite?\n\nPivot 2 August 22, 2017 \u201cThey\u2019re elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were. ... You know what? I think we\u2019re the elites. They\u2019re not the elites.\u201d At a speech in Phoenix, Arizona. June 20, 2018 \u201cWhy are they elite?\u201d At a speech in Duluth, Minnesota. June 25, 2018 \u201cWe are the super-elite, we are the super-elite.\u201d At a speech in West Columbia, South Carolina. June 27, 2018 \u201cThey\u2019ve been stone cold losers, the elite.\u201d At a speech in Fargo, North Dakota. August 21, 2018 \u201cI said, \u2018Well, I have a lot more money than they do. I have a much better education than they have ... Why the hell are they the elite?\u2019\u201d At a speech in Charleston, West Virginia. August 24, 2018 \u201cI\u2019m much more elite than any of them. So are you. We\u2019re much more elite. We\u2019re smarter. We\u2019re richer. We\u2019re better educated, in most cases \u2026 they\u2019re slobs.\u201d At a speech in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nAnother former Trump adviser suggested to me that it\u2019s less strategic, and more a visceral response to discovering that he can be president and still not considered elite by the arbiters of the standard. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think he got enough credit for overcoming the odds to win,\u201d this person told me. \u201cAnd I just think it\u2019s a way of legitimizing his victory.\u201d\n\nBut can it be more than just pinning a medal on himself? Whether he believes it or not, Trump\u2019s rhetoric actually taps into a deeply American idea: The promise of true democracy is that nobody is better than anyone else, that the power over the government should be broadly shared rather than commandeered by monied elites. Long, maybe the most purely populist campaigner ever, distilled his anti-elite platform into four simple words: \u201cEvery man a king.\u201d Even people who disagree with and fear Trump acknowledge that he\u2019s getting at a painful truth: A lot of Americans really have been excluded.\n\nBut Long\u2019s phrase came with another, less-quoted clause: \u201cBut no one wears a crown.\u201d No one thinks for a moment that Trump believes in Long\u2019s socialist redistribution of wealth as a cure for income inequality. But they do fear that by channeling a legitimate economic grievance into a hatred of establishment elites he might be paving the way for a form of governmental power that is not democratic, but the opposite.\n\n\u201cElites are masters of their eras, but they are also metaphors for them. They illustrate what is valued, how success is earned, and how power is garnered and wielded. ... Indeed, elites reveal how we see our own societies.\u201d David Rothkopf\n\nLuntz, for one, doesn\u2019t think Trump, no matter how well he communicates to the \u201cforgotten\u201d and the \u201cfucked,\u201d can actually reshape society\u2014for the better or for the worse\u2014simply by giving his supporters the ultimate confidence booster.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Luntz said. \u201cAnd here\u2019s the reason: Donald Trump in his convention speech said it clearly, when he said, \u2018I alone \u2026 \u2019\u201d This, Luntz believes, is temporary. \u201cIt\u2019s not a movement,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about a man.\u201d\n\nA very self-obsessed man. For all the ferocity of his anti-establishment agitation, the germophobic distance Trump keeps from the crowds at his rallies reminds his critics that when he says, \u201cWe\u2019re the elites,\u201d he\u2019s speaking of the \u201croyal we.\u201d This is what makes some people suspicious of his motivations and unwilling, even though he is president, to accord him the honor of the office. It is not the job that makes the man, they believe, but the other way around.\n\nIn Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making, David Rothkopf offered an expansive assessment: \u201cElites are masters of their eras, but they are also metaphors for them. They illustrate what is valued, how success is earned, and how power is garnered and wielded. They also reflect what flaws we tolerate in those at the top and what flaws we find unacceptable. Indeed, elites reveal how we see our own societies.\u201d\n\nHow, I asked Rothkopf, based on the definition in his book, is Trump not elite already?\n\nHe was unmoved.\n\n\u201cTrump,\u201d Rothkopf said, \u201cis a tiny little boy, knocking on a big mahogany door, saying, \u2018Let me in!\u2019 And he\u2019s never going to get in. And I think the ultimate irony of his life is he has been elevated to the most powerful job in the world. And so long as he is in it, it declines in importance.\u201d He likened it to Greek tragedy. \u201cThere is no bigger job. There is no greater way for him to do it. And there is no greater proof that he is a pretender.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, though, the \u201cpretender\u201d is the president. And already, halfway through his first term, it is hard to outright dismiss the notion that Trump is in some sense redefining each and every day what it means to be elite, merely by existing in the White House.\n\nMichael Kruse is a senior staff writer at Politico Magazine.", "Missouri Republican nominee Josh Hawley has attempted to make his Senate race a referendum on Sen.

GOP candidates are pairing the late rallies with Trump-focused closing arguments on TV \u2014 the party\u2019s nominees in Indiana, Montana, Tennessee and West Virginia are airing late ads featuring clips of Trump supporting them and bashing their opponents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d be there if he didn\u2019t think we were going to be able to bring it home,\u201d said Todd Graves, the chairman of Missouri\u2019s Republican Party. He added: \u201cSoutheast Missouri, that\u2019s probably the strongest Trump country, and that is sending a clear message to the good folks in that part of the state on how important the next day is.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more than any other Senate candidate in the country, Missouri Republican nominee Josh Hawley has nationalized his campaign, attempting to make it a pure referendum on McCaskill\u2019s status as a Democrat in a Trump state. He has relentlessly linked McCaskill to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and focused on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation \u2014 even as Hawley, the Missouri attorney general, faces late revelations about alleged mismanagement of his state office.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Hawley told POLITICO the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings \u201ccrystallized\u201d what was at stake in the election and scoffed at a question about whether he disagreed with Trump on any issues, arguing the president\u2019s agenda has been good for the state.\n\n\u201cSenator McCaskill is a party-line liberal Democrat,\u201d Hawley said, standing outside his campaign bus \u2014 which is bedecked with massive pictures of McCaskill, Schumer and Pelosi \u2014 at a farm and grain storage facility. \u201cThat is not what this state wants, that is not what this state told her to do, and that\u2019s why she is sinking in the polls and going to lose in November.\u201d\n\nDemocrats view the race as a dead heat, and believe McCaskill is well within striking distance if she can turn out the Democratic base and peel off enough Republican voters to eke out a win. They view Trump\u2019s two visits as a signal that Hawley needs a major boost, not as a sign of Republican strength.\n\nAt every campaign stop this past weekend, McCaskill closed by imploring volunteers to pick up extra shifts, saying the race could come down to the number of folks in the room.\n\n\u201cI think the race is really close. I think they do, too,\u201d McCaskill said at a campaign office in Kansas City last week when asked about Republicans\u2019 confidence. \u201cDon\u2019t judge by what they say, judge by how they act. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re acting like they\u2019ve got this race put away. I think they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s very close and it is.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s visits will highlight McCaskill\u2019s narrow path to victory as she fights to both pick up votes in Missouri\u2019s conservative areas and energize her Democratic base. McCaskill has consistently attacked Hawley on health care, specifically for joining a lawsuit to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate insurance regulations benefiting people with pre-existing conditions. Hawley has said he supports protecting pre-existing conditions, but says it should be done outside the confines of Obamacare. McCaskill has also brought in former Vice President Joe Biden Wednesday to rally the base in St. Louis.\n\nBut McCaskill also highlights her record supporting Trump\u2019s lower court judicial nominees and touts the number of pieces of her legislation Trump has signed. During a debate last week, she said the president should use \u201cevery tool\u201d to enforce security on the border. Hawley, meanwhile, routinely bashes McCaskill for voting against both of the president\u2019s Supreme Court nominees and the GOP\u2019s 2017 tax law.\n\nIn the closing days of the campaign, Democrats have also highlighted reports about Hawley\u2019s tenure as attorney general, accusing him of shirking his official duties in order to focus on the campaign. The Kansas City Star reported Wednesday that Hawley\u2019s political consultants helped direct business in his official office starting shortly after he was sworn in, which Democrats say underscores their portrayal of Hawley as a political climber, even as the Republican runs a campaign decrying politics as usual in Washington.\n\nRoy Temple, a former chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party, said the report highlights Democrats\u2019 view of Hawley as a \u201cblindly ambitious politician\u201d and could change the trajectory of the race in McCaskill\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty strong arrow in the quiver to go into the final edge in the race,\u201d Temple said.\n\nHawley\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the report. Last week, he defended his tenure as attorney general, saying that any suggestion that he\u2019d been \u201canything other than an aggressive prosecutor is ridiculous.\u201d\n\nInstead, the Republican\u2019s campaign has kept its focus on Kavanaugh. Hawley campaigned Monday with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who became a sudden star to conservatives after his aggressive defense of the justice during the hearing examining allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cIf we win here, it will be the most visible symbol that Kavanaugh did matter,\u201d Graham said in Missouri earlier this week.", "CNN President Jeff Zucker sparred verbally with the president after the network was sent pipe bombs last week. | Roy Rochlin/Getty Images Media CNN cools on hiring Trump alums Network president Jeff Zucker has told people that he\u2019s not interested in hiring former officials he perceives as complicit in spreading falsehoods.\n\nCNN is known for its big panels and endless parade of talking heads, but the network is signaling that it\u2019s running out of room for figures from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nWith the midterms next week, many White House aides are soon expected to head for the exits and look for new gigs, including in media. But CNN president Jeff Zucker has told people inside and outside the network that he\u2019s not interested in hiring former officials he perceives as complicit in spreading falsehoods or spurious talking points, according to four people familiar with the conversations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"If they do any hiring after the midterms, it's more likely to be members of Congress, senators and governors who lost their races, plus outgoing GOP members,\" including some who would likely defend Trump, one of the people familiar with CNN said.\n\nThere is no hard rule in place, however, and Zucker would be interested in what he views as independent-minded officials who he thinks have avoided damaging their credibility, another of the people said, citing Nikki Haley, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, as an example.\n\nMultiple networks, including CNN, have put out feelers to Haley, who has so far rebuffed them, said two talent agents familiar with the outreach.\n\nMorning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nAt MSNBC, where the conservative voices are almost uniformly of the never-Trump variety, executives are also out on former Trump administration officials, the two agents said. But Fox News, where ex-Trump aide Sebastian Gorka became a paid national security analyst after leaving the White House, could be more welcoming to former administration officials.\n\n\u201cWe are always open to talking with strong political experts on both sides of the aisle who are interested in being on-air talent,\u201d a Fox News spokesperson said.\n\nMSNBC and CNN declined to comment on the record.\n\nThe cooling interest at CNN comes after the network took flak for hiring analysts who had signed non-disclosure agreements \u2014 and as its relationship with the White House has grown even more tense after the network was sent pipe bombs over the last week. After the network\u2019s New York office was forced to evacuate, Zucker sparred verbally with Trump and his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\n\nThe broader job landscape for departing Trump officials could be just as challenging beyond media. Some officials from the Trump administration have already struggled to land the same high-powered jobs their predecessors in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations secured.\n\nFor instance, former Obama press secretaries Robert Gibbs and Jay Carney joined the executive teams at McDonald\u2018s and Amazon, respectively, and former White House chief of staff Andy Card landed a senior post at the global public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard after leaving Bush\u2019s side.\n\nTrump's former communications director, Hope Hicks, scored a job on Rupert Murdoch's Fox payroll, and another top communications aide, Josh Raffel, now works with the e-cigarette company Juul. Others, such as former deputy national security adviser Dina Powell and ex-chief of staff Reince Priebus, returned to old employers after the White House.\n\nBut former White House press secretary Sean Spicer never picked up a high-profile corporate or media job after resigning as White House press secretary in July 2017. He now consults, does speeches and serves as a spokesman and senior adviser for the Trump-aligned super PAC America First Action. Ex-chief strategist Steve Bannon lost both his role as executive chairman of the right-wing news site Breitbart and his primary financial backer, Rebekah Mercer. He only recently re-emerged from a year-long hiatus to debut his latest project, \u201cTrump@War,\u201d a feature-length film that takes aim at Democrats and the media elite.\n\n\u201cThe corporate gigs do not exist,\u201d one former White House official said.\n\n\u201cPeople whose resumes predate the White House are basically going to end up fine,\u201d the former official said. \u201cPeople who think their job in the White House is going to be their golden parachute to a high-level corporate gig are going to find themselves crashing and burning.\u201d\n\nAt the very least, exiting administration officials in the past have been able to count on TV gigs where they could capitalize on their inside perspective. And more than its competitors, CNN tends to air commentators from across the political spectrum, including liberals and pro- and anti-Trump conservatives.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Zucker hired former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, even after he was dismissed from his role amid an assault allegation by a reporter \u2014 and despite the fact that he had signed an NDA with the campaign. CNN was savaged for the decision, which Zucker defended at the time by telling Variety, \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to have voices on CNN who are supportive of the Republican nominee.\u201d\n\nIn August, anchor Poppy Harlow challenged former Trump campaign hand and CNN contributor Rob Astorino about whether he could speak openly about Trump matters, as he struggled to answer her questions.\n\nCNN\u2019s last hire from the White House was Marc Short, the president\u2019s top liaison to Capitol Hill, whose wonky presence in TV interviews during his tenure was markedly different from some of his flame-throwing colleagues. Since joining the network last summer, Short has disclosed multiple times on air that he signed a document preventing him from disclosing sensitive information or private conversations with the president, but he has said he is free to offer his \u201cunvarnished opinion.\u201d\n\nHaving signed an NDA \u2014 which many lawyers believe are not enforceable \u2014 would not immediately disqualify someone from consideration for a job at CNN, a person familiar with the network said, but that person would need to offer a unique perspective, and there would have be consensus that he or she could speak freely on the network.\n\nIn any case, there is a feeling inside CNN that the contributor roster is \u201cpretty full on all sides,\u201d the person said, though any potentially interesting candidates would be considered on a case-by-case basis. People who have \"in the room\" expertise but who operated under the radar and did not publicly defend Trump's less factual statements could stand a better chance.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a behind-the-scenes player, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to do TV,\u201d one of the agents said. \u201cThe ones who are going to have difficulty are the mouthpieces of Trump.\u201d\n\nIf they can't get cable gigs, though, administration aides might still have a shot at publishing deals.\n\nOne prominent D.C. literary agent told POLITICO he is in talks with would-be authors from the Department of Justice and the FBI, and he anticipates an uptick in submissions once special counsel Robert Mueller releases his final report on the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThere will be publishers interested in these books if they sell,\u201d said D.C.-based literary agent Gail Ross, adding that readers could get tired of Trump books at some point. \"Very few people are going to get the Woodward numbers or the Wolff numbers, but everybody wants to try.\"\n\nDaniel Lippman contributed to this report.\n\n", "An unprecedented surge of women, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is on the midterm ballot, and most of them are Democrats. | Michael Swensen/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool Elections Wave of Democratic women could reshape party agenda\n\nThe surge in female candidates this year is poised to remake the face of Congress \u2014 whether or not there\u2019s a so-called blue wave on Election Day. In this year\u2019s primaries, Democrats nominated 198 women for Congress overall, while Republicans nominated 59.\n\nBut new data shared exclusively with POLITICO by The Primaries Project at Brookings also suggests the influx of new female members could significantly alter how the Democratic Party shapes its message and sets its policy agenda.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe record-breaking number of Democratic women who sought their party\u2019s nomination won primaries at a higher rate than their Republican counterparts. In House primaries without an incumbent, Democratic women faced off against male candidates in 147 races and were victorious in 101 of those races.\n\nBy contrast, only 51 Republican primaries featured such a match-up, and Republican women won only 17 of those races. The end result? An unprecedented surge of women on the midterm ballot, most of them Democrats.\n\nData compiled by Brookings researchers Elaine Karmarck and Alex Podkul suggests that gender is a key divide not just between the parties \u2014 witness the wide gender gap in the polls this year \u2014 but within them as well. The project catalogued every primary nationwide, tracked which issues candidates mentioned and what positions they held.\n\nIn the 2018 Democratic primaries, female candidates were more likely than their male counterparts to mention abortion, federal education policy, same-sex marriage and gun control as campaign issues.\n\nHowever, the data reveal essentially no gender divides on the underlying policy positions candidates took on these issues \u2014 a result that Karmarck says is consistent with existing research.\n\n\u201cOn abortion, it may be that Democratic men and Democratic women have the same position and end up taking the same votes\u201d said Karmarck, \u201cbut the greater salience of that issue to women means that it may come up further up on the agenda, with more attention paid to it.\u201d\n\nThat agenda-setting effect is likely to be felt in the next Congress.\n\n\u201cWomen in Congress see a difference in the perspective that women bring into the institution,\u201d said Kira Sanbonmatsu, a professor of political science at Rutgers University who interviewed, with her coauthors, most of the women who served in the 114th Congress for their recent book, \u201cA Seat at the Table: Congresswomen\u2019s Perspectives on Why Their Presence Matters.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no single way to represent women, but women in office see a disproportionate responsibility to articulate issues important to women.\u201d\n\nDemocratic women might also be using these issues strategically to distinguish themselves in crowded primary fields \u2014 a dynamic that could play a central role in the upcoming 2020 Democratic primary, which could include several women candidates running in a crowded field of men.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But there was again little evidence of a gender divide on their underlying positions: Republican men and women across the board called for less federal intervention and more local control of schools.\n\nAccording to Kamarck, the Republican Party\u2019s growing weakness among women voters appears more directly tied to the president\u2019s personal behavior.\n\n\u201cWith Trump and women, it goes way beyond policy, and that\u2019s why you see some evidence of Republican women moving over to vote Democratic,\u201d said Karmarck. \u201cIt\u2019s more who he is and how he conducts himself has proved to be anathema to a lot of American women.\u201d\n\nExit polls commissioned by Brookings suggest that women voting in the Republican primaries were more likely than Republican men to say they\u2019d want someone other than President Trump to be the Republican nominee in 2020. They were also more likely to break with the president\u2019s positions on immigration and foreign policy.", "Scott aired his next biggest share of pre-existing condition ads \u2014 at least 590 \u2014 in Tampa, targeting suburban moderates who he might be able to persuade to vote for him in 2018 | Getty Scott homes in on Hispanic, independent voters with health care ad\n\nTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate race could come down to what polls show is the No. 1 issue for Hispanic and independent voters: health care.\n\nGov. Rick Scott, the GOP nominee, appears to be hyperaware of that statistic. Since early voting began, he\u2019s run at least 1,333 ads in Orlando and Tampa media markets \u2014 crucial for reaching Hispanic and independents voters \u2014 wherein he promises to protect patients with pre-existing health conditions. The political group supporting his opponent, Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson, has run at least 541 TV hits in those same media markets, trying to convince voters of the opposite.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith less than a week until the general election and polls still showing a dead heat between Scott and Nelson, the single-issue focus could be a smart play for either candidate, putting them in a position to motivate two coveted groups of voters, said Democratic operative Steve Schale, who ran President Barack Obama\u2019s Florida campaign in 2008.\n\n\u201cI have long believed that Florida is both a turnout and a persuasion state,\u201d Schale said, conceding that the race \u201cjust feels tight.\u201d\n\nIn the nation\u2019s largest swing state, the key to victory for Nelson or Scott will be convincing independent and certain Hispanic voters to sway their way. The calculus here is that concerns about health coverage will motivate both voting blocs without alienating others.\n\nIn total, Scott has aired at least 2,029 television ads trying to convince voters that he\u2019s going to protect them from losing their health insurance for illnesses they already have. By contrast, Senate Majority PAC, the political committee backing Nelson, has run even more ads \u2014 at least 2,707 \u2014 trying to convince voters that Scott won\u2019t protect them.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 ads have run most heavily \u2014 at least 521 times \u2014 in Miami, where, Schale said, Nelson needs to run up the margin.\n\nBoth sides have aired hundreds of ads highlighting their dueling messages in each of six of the state\u2019s 10 media markets; Democrats have aired the spots in 9 of 10 markets. It\u2019s the No. 1 ad issue since early voting began in select parts of the state on Oct. 22 and statewide on this past Saturday.\n\nWith control of Congress and the governor\u2019s office at stake, more than 3.5 million people have already cast ballots. There are still three days left of early voting. It\u2019s a clear surge compared to 2014, when nearly 3.2 million people voted before Election Day.\n\nProtecting patients with pre-existing conditions is the most popular provision of the current federal health care law, the Affordable Care Act, and two new polls show health care overall is the most important issue for both independents and Hispanics.\n\n\u201cThe biggest rate increase from 2014 to 2018 is Hispanic turnout. They very well could determine election,\u201d said Daniel A. Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who studies the state\u2019s voter rolls and trends. He adds that Hispanics, overall, still do not turn out to the polls at as high a rate as other groups.\n\nIn general, voters say they trust Democrats over Republicans to protect their health care. But the question for Scott is whether he can convince enough of the crucial persuadable voters, like independents and Hispanics, that they can trust him specifically.\n\n\u201cIn the Puerto Rican community, Rick Scott is competing for their vote harder than any other Republican Senate candidate I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said longtime Republican operative David Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s an effective effort. I think he\u2019s going to do very well in that community.\u201d\n\nA poll released on Wednesday by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy shows that 57 percent of Puerto Ricans oppose repealing the Affordable Care Act. The community typically leans Democratic, but Scott had an early lead with the group before Nelson pulled ahead in August.\n\nFrom Oct. 25 to Oct. 31, Scott aired at least 743 ads in the Puerto Rican-heavy Orlando media market, claiming that he supports forcing insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nScott aired his next biggest share of pre-existing condition ads \u2014 at least 590 \u2014 in Tampa, targeting suburban moderates who he might be able to persuade to vote for him in 2018, as he did in 2014. Voters in Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, voted against President Donald Trump in 2016.\n\n\u201cYou want to protect those voters, but it\u2019s a turnout war now,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe persuasion was done and now it is identifying those you\u2019ve already persuaded to turnout.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt protecting patients with pre-existing conditions is Democrats\u2019 biggest message to Florida voters this campaign season. It\u2019s not only most important to Democratic and independent voters but it\u2019s also Republicans' biggest vulnerability.\n\nIn 2017, the GOP-controlled Congress failed to repeal and replace the ACA, which enshrined those protections into federal law; the bill that came closest to passing would have weakened those protections. Since then, the Trump administration and 20 GOP-led states, including Florida, have sought dismantle the law and its protection of pre-existing conditions through a federal Texas court, a case that\u2019s ongoing.\n\nOn Wednesday, the state Democratic party held four different campaign events on health care while Trump stumped in Florida for Scott and Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Halloween and we want to make sure folks are not tricked,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor in Tampa. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s at stake: your health care. Health care is central to this election.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s record doesn\u2019t back up his claim that he would protect people with pre-existing health conditions from paying much more for health care or losing coverage all together. And while he says he supports those protections but not the rest of the ACA, he\u2019s never articulated how he would pay for those protections, which are paid for currently by the ACA.\n\nPaying for sick and poor patients' health insurance is a large part of the law in general. Of the five measures implemented through the ACA to help pay for these two groups\u2018 health care, Scott has openly opposed four of them: Cutting Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and doctors; taxing wealthy individuals like him; requiring everyone to have health insurance, known as the individual mandate before it was zeroed-out by the GOP-controlled Congress in 2017; and charging people who don\u2019t qualify for federal subsidies higher insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cThere are a variety of ways to increase access to health care and reduce costs, while protecting people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Scott campaign spokesman Chris Hartline without explaining what those ways are. \u201cWhen Governor Scott gets to the United States Senate, he looks forward to working with members of both parties to find a real solution to solve health care problems in this country.\"\n\nHartline added: \"The only people who can\u2019t understand that position are liberal Democrats and members of the media who have bought into their lie that Obamacare is the only solution to this country\u2019s health care problems.\"", "President Donald Trump talks with Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis (left) and Florida Gov.

But the two men remain in nearly tied races against their opponents, with most polls indicating the Democrats have the slightest of marginal leads.\n\nScott\u2019s appearance at the rally was in doubt because he had both been keeping some distance from Trump and had announced after Hurricane Michael struck Florida on Oct. 10 that he was temporarily suspending all campaign trail appearances.\n\nTrump praised Scott\u2019s post-storm crisis management, which gave him a national platform but which unexpectedly failed to boost his poll numbers .\n\n\u201cHe takes a problem. He turns it into an asset,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a talent.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Scott touted his close relationship with Trump who, Scott said, gave Florida everything it wanted when it was struck by Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Michael.\n\nScott stuck to his longtime message of talking about jobs \u2014 specifically the 1.6 million private-sector jobs created during his two terms as governor \u2014 and described his opponent, Sen. Bill Nelson, as a do-nothing who has held various elected offices for four decades.\n\n\u201cBill Nelson cares about one job: his,\u201d Scott said to cheers, attacking the Democrat for voting against the \u201cTrump tax cuts\u201d and voting for tax increases while watching the national debt soar on his watch, although some of that future debt will be bigger because of the president\u2019s tax cut package that Scott lauds.\n\nScott also accused Nelson of being for \u201ccatch and release\u201d immigration policies, an allegation the Democrat\u2019s campaign has denied.\n\nBut Scott steered clear of Trump\u2019s hard-line talk on immigration, specifically his call to end birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment. It\u2019s an issue Scott has tried to avoid personally discussing in depth, going so far as to walk away from a Miami Herald reporter who asked about it on Tuesday.\n\nAt the rally, DeSantis also accused his opponent of being soft on immigration and accused Gillum of supporting sanctuary cities, a claim that Gillum denied onstage at their last debate last week. DeSantis pointed out that Gillum wants to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency but didn\u2019t mention that Gillum wants to have its duties carried out by the Justice Department. DeSantis also repeated his debunked claim that Tallahassee has the highest crime rate in Florida.\n\nDeSantis described himself as the only candidate who had served in the military and who doesn\u2019t want to raise taxes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only guy who can credibly say I\u2019m not under investigation for corruption,\u201d DeSantis said to applause.\n\nGillum, who maintains he was not a target of the FBI probe, has responded to the charges from DeSantis by accusing him of running interference for Trump in Congress to shut down a wide-ranging investigation of the president\u2019s campaign that has resulted in numerous indictments, including Trump\u2019s personal lawyer.\n\nGillum has called for Trump to be impeached. But DeSantis said Gillum should be kicked out of office instead.\n\n\u201cThis is a guy who took bribes from an undercover FBI agent, took money from a lobbyist, didn\u2019t pay back the lobbyist,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should impeach Gillum as mayor of Tallahassee!\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared, with some chanting \u201cTrump!

In the county where the rally was held, Lee County, and neighboring Collier County, turnout for pre-Election Day early voting is among the highest in the state. Already, more than 36 percent have voted, many of them Republicans.\n\nTrump learned that almost by accident.\n\n\u201cWho voted?\u201d he asked, watching with disbelief as thousands raised their hands.\n\n\u201cEverybody voted already?\u201d he asked to cheers. \u201cLet me see again: who voted?\u201d\n\nOnce again, they raised their hands and cheered.\n\nTrump: \u201cThen what the hell am I doing here tonight?\u201d\n\n", "Democrat Andy Kim\u2019s candidacy has been boosted by the wave of anti-Trump anger that\u2019s swept the state\u2019s suburbs. | AP Photo MacArthur, Kim debate Trump policies, but steer clear of Trump\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s policies, but not his name, dominated Tuesday night\u2019s debate in New Jersey\u2019s hotly contested 3rd Congressional District.\n\nThe president\u2019s name was barely uttered, despite the fact Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur is Trump\u2019s biggest ally in the New Jersey delegation, and Democrat Andy Kim\u2019s candidacy has been boosted by the wave of anti-Trump anger that\u2019s swept the state\u2019s suburbs.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI work with the president when I can, and when I disagree with him, say so,\u201d MacArthur, echoing a line both he and other New Jersey GOP candidates have repeatedly used, said during the debate, which was televised by NJTV.\n\nMacArthur\u2019s association with Trump has been front and center for the last two years.\n\nHe authored the amendment that nearly saved the president\u2019s attempt to repeal Obamacare and was the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote for the Trump tax law. Trump, for his part, has headlined a fundraiser for MacArthur that raised almost $1 million. But despite MacArthur\u2019s deep pockets and ties to Trump, Kim has consistently outraised him in campaign cash.\n\nKim accused MacArthur of voting with \u201cleadership,\u201d but stopped short of bashing Trump himself.\n\n\u201cHe stands with his party leadership that he votes 94 percent in line with. He stands with them on state and local tax deduction,\u201d Kim said of MacArthur. \u201cI stand with the delegation of New Jersey \u2014 the other 11 members of Congress from New Jersey, including the other four Republican members of Congress who voted against this tax law because they knew it was a bad deal for New Jersey.\u201d\n\nMacArthur, 58, is a millionaire former insurance executive who moved from Randolph in North Jersey to run for Congress in 2014, when the 3rd District seat opened up. Kim, 36, grew up in the district, but has spent most of his adult life in Washington and overseas, where he worked as a civilian national security official in several roles.\n\nThe 3rd District \u2014 which runs from the shore, across the Pinelands and into the Philadelphia suburbs \u2014 is split roughly evenly between a heavily Republican and pro-Trump area of Ocean County, and a more Democratic area of Burlington County. Most recent polls have shown the two candidates virtually tied.\n\nState Democrats have complained that political organizations supporting MacArthur have put out racist advertising against Kim, who is Korean-American. A flyer from the Republican State Committee used a font resembling a Chinese restaurant menu to highlight Kim\u2019s name. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC with ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Kim was \u201cnot one of us.\u201d\n\nMacArthur, who adopted two children from Korea, said the idea that he\u2019s racist is \u201csimply absurd\u201d and has accused Kim of \u201ctrying to get sympathy from people for it.\u201d\n\nKim, however, said the accusations of racism are \u201ccontinued distractions from the main issues of this campaign.\u201d\n\nAnd that, Kim stressed, was health care.\n\n\u201cMy concerns are and the voters\u2019 concerns are my opponent\u2019s record on health care, how he gutted pre-existing condition protections,\u201d Kim said.\n\n\u201cYou continue to say things like that that you know are dishonest,\u201d MacArthur shot back. \u201cYou know that our bill specifically protected people\u2018s pre-existing conditions.\u201d\n\nWhile MacArthur\u2019s amendment did not allow for insurance companies to not insure customers based on pre-existing conditions, health care experts said it allowed states to apply for waivers that would effectively let insurers charge prohibitively high amounts to some people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nMacArthur also accused Kim of supporting expanding Medicare for all Americans.\n\n\u201cThe answer is not the Medicare for all that my opponent has adopted. That will bankrupt Medicare as we know it,\u201d he said.\n\nMacArthur based that claim on Kim stating at an earlier event that he wanted \u201cuniversal health care\u201d and that there was \u201ca lot of good\u201d in the Medicare proposal. But Kim did not endorse any plan to expand Medicare.\n\n\u201cMy opponent tries to take those words and take them out of context,\u201d Kim said.\n\nMacArthur said that Kim was purposefully speaking in \u201cgauzy generalities.\u201d \u201cYou wanted that audience to think that you were with them. It was obvious,\u201d MacArthur said .\n\nMacArthur also defended his vote for the tax law, which studies have found that, on balance, saves the average voter of his district money, even while eliminating the popular tax deductions. Kim said the rest of the delegation \u201cvoted against this tax law because they knew it was a bad deal for New Jersey.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess your idea of leadership is if people are going this way you\u2019re just going to follow the herd,\u201d MacArthur said. \u201cI don\u2019t relish being alone on a vote, but I didn\u2019t go to Congress for people to tell me how to vote.\u201d\n\nMacArthur also attacked Kim for \u201cr\u00e9sum\u00e9 puffery,\u201d saying the Democrat had inflated his national security credentials, overstating his importance as an adviser to top civilian and military brass.\n\n\u201cWhen he says he was a strategic adviser to a top general and instead he was in a think tank that the group instead advised, he\u2019s puffing up his resume and making himself sound like a national security expert,\u201d MacArthur said.\n\nKim noted that retired Gen. David Petraeus had said he served \u201cwith distinction\u201d in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cMaybe you would if you ever visited our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d Kim said.", "President Donald Trump said that despite a \u201csmall protest,\u201d in Pittsburgh he and first lady Melania Trump were treated very kindly during their visit but that the media did not accurately reflect how they were received. | Chris O'Meara/AP Photo White House Trump, at Florida rally, raises synagogue shooting to slam media\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday night again invoked the mass shooting at a synagogue to slam the news media, opening a campaign rally in Florida by telling a vocal crowd that coverage of his visit to Pittsburgh the day before was \u201cfake and make-believe.\u201d\n\nTrump paid a solemn visit to the city on Tuesday in the aftermath of Saturday\u2019s shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue, which left 11 dead.

And he already has an heir apparent: Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, a longtime lobbyist for the oil and gas and water industries, who would be well placed to execute President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel, anti-regulatory policies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA department spokesperson said Zinke is not planning to step down soon. But he appears to be laying the groundwork to hand the reins to Bernhardt, who joined the Trump administration last year.\n\n\u201cFor the last month, if not longer, it has been a common reference, even from the secretary, that David needs to be ready,\u201d said a source close to Interior\u2019s senior staff, who requested anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters. \u201cNot anything actionable [was said], but Bernhardt could be in charge in the future and the implication was sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nZinke has faced more than a dozen probes from Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General and other watchdog agencies. Those include the IG\u2019s ongoing examination of a land deal in Montana \u2014 first reported by POLITICO \u2014 that brought together Zinke and the chairman of Halliburton, one of the world\u2019s largest energy companies, with extensive business before the Interior Department.\n\nAllies of the secretary say the investigation is not driving him from the department, but he has discussed the possibility of seeking higher office or pursuing lucrative opportunities in the private sector.\n\nBernhardt, a former lobbyist known as \u201ca lawyer\u2019s lawyer\u201d in the industry who is despised by environmental groups, could wind up playing a role similar to the one that longtime Washington lobbyist Andrew Wheeler has played after becoming acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency this summer. In contrast to former EPA chief Pruitt, who had alienated even many Republican lawmakers with his cascade of personal scandals, Wheeler has kept a relatively low profile while continuing to methodically roll back environmental rules and promote coal and oil production.\n\nBernhardt worked at Interior as solicitor during the George W. Bush administration, a time when the department had also been rocked by scandal over its division overseeing energy leases. He then went to lobbyist firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, where he worked for a client seeking to pump water from the Mojave Desert to Southern California.\n\nMany environmental activists fear Bernhardt would be more effective than Zinke in executing Trump\u2019s agenda. In fact, they contend he\u2019s already doing it, having taken meetings with appropriations staff and led policy on top-tier items like overhauling the Endangered Species Act and reorganizing the department.\n\n\u201cWhy would I want him to take over? I can\u2019t say that I do,\u201d said Aaron Weiss, media director with the Center for Western Priorities and a frequent Zinke critic who has not called for him to resign or be fired.\n\n\u201cThere are so many parallels with the Scott Pruitt and Andrew Wheeler situation [at EPA] and the Ryan Zinke and David Bernhardt situation. Andrew Wheeler knows exactly how to pull the levers of policy,\u201d Weiss added. \u201cDave Bernhardt is the exact same way. He is a walking conflict of interest.\u201d\n\nZinke\u2019s tenure has been under a cloud formed by multiple investigations into his behavior at Interior. The IG office has been looking at his ties to Halliburton Chairman Dave Lesar, who met with Zinke at Interior headquarters to discuss a real estate deal involving land owned by a nonprofit Zinke established that is now controlled by his wife.\n\nThe IG is also looking into whether Zinke bowed to political pressure in blocking requests from Native American tribes to open a Connecticut casino. That probe was requested in response to POLITICO\u2019s report on lobbying by the tribes\u2019 business rivals.\n\nIt is not clear which investigation was referred to the Justice Department.\n\nThe investigations might weigh on the secretary's time but would not necessarily be the driving factor behind a resignation, sources familiar with his thinking said. One source close to Zinke, who requested anonymity to discuss internal Interior matters, pointed to the scandals that plagued former Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who faced a special prosecutor\u2019s investigation into Interior\u2019s handling of a proposed American Indian casino in Wisconsin. (The prosecutor declined to file charges, calling evidence of wrongdoing \u201cinsufficient.\u201d)\n\n\u201cBabbitt had the same kind of issues,\u201d the source said. \u201cAny secretary has some investigations into them.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokespeople did not reply to questions.\n\nThe scandals also haven\u2019t appeared to shake Trump\u2019s affinity for Zinke, three sources said, although Cabinet members have seen their fortunes change quickly in the past. Before Pruitt\u2019s resignation in July, Trump stuck by the embattled EPA chief through months of negative press over the cut-rate rent he paid for a lobbyist\u2019s condo, his advocacy for a Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife and other flaps that became fodder for late night TV.\n\nHowever, Pruitt also faced internal criticism from White House aides who saw him as an ultimately ineffective sideshow, one who rushed to complete sloppy and insufficiently supported work justifying his agency\u2019s deregulatory actions. Zinke has not raised similar red flags, one official said.\n\n\u201cWith Pruitt you heard more general concerns,\u201d the White House official said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything to even hint that there\u2019s any concern or a loss of faith in Zinke.\u201d\n\nWhile those investigations keep Zinke\u2019s names in headlines, Bernhardt has quietly been taking on much of the responsibility for pushing Trump\u2019s agenda, sources have said.\n\nBernhardt has taken the lead in softening provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a move seen as making it easier for oil and gas companies to drill in ecologically sensitive areas.\n\nHe\u2019s also taken a lead role in what had been Zinke\u2019s signature policy campaign \u2014 reorganizing the department and sending more staff to Western states. Bernhardt has become \u201cthe main point of contact\u201d on the reorganization, Jay Tilton, a spokesperson for Senate Appropriations Committee Democrats, told POLITICO.\n\nInterior is trying to reorganize its regional jurisdiction around geographic watersheds and move headquarters for the Fish and Wildlife Service and other agencies to Western states. The move that will require budgetary authority from Congress.\n\nRequests for records have turned up scant communication from Bernhardt, a K Street veteran with ties to industries that he now regulates \u2014 raising additional fears among green groups. Western Values Project filed a lawsuit in July demanding access to Bernhardt\u2019s official communications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a like-for-like trade between Zinke and Bernhardt,\u201d said Chris Saeger, director of Western Values Project, but the group is still planning to call for Zinke\u2019s resignation. \u201cThere were lots of reasons to believe Bernhardt was the de facto secretary, anyway. And you\u2019re going to have the same amount of scandal.\u201d\n\nAfter Pruitt resigned from EPA, the agency was left in the hands of Wheeler, a Washington veteran who lobbied for coal and other interests after a career at EPA and on the Hill. The policy direction hasn\u2019t changed at EPA, and Trump suggested last week that he may tap Wheeler to become permanent administrator.\n\n\u201cIf you look at it in the most cynical possible way, for liberals it was better for Pruitt to be there because he could do less,\u201d said Melanie Sloan, senior adviser with American Oversight. \u201cBut it sends the wrong message.\u201d\n\n"]
