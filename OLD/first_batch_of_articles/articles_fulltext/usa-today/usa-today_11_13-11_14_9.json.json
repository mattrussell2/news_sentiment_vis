["Jacob deGrom 10 wins is the fewest by a Cy Young award winner. (Photo: Brad Penner, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nHow much should a pitcher's win total matter when voting for the Cy Young?\n\nNot much these days.\n\nJacob deGrom won the prestigious award on Wednesday in the National League despite winning just 10 games \u2013 the lowest win total ever for a starting Cy Young winner. Seattle Mariners pitcher Felix Hernandez had 13 victories when he won the 2010 AL Cy Young.\n\n\"This confirms the Cy Young is an award not only for the pitcher with the most wins but the most dominant,\" said Hernandez in 2010.\n\nIndeed.\n\nThe New York Mets ace received 29 of 30 first-place votes for 207 total points in voting conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America at the end of the regular season.\n\nWashington Nationals ace Max Scherzer, who won eight more games than deGrom, received one first-place votes for 123 total points, followed by the Philadelphia Phillies' Aaron Nola, who won 17 games and finished third in the race with 86 points.\n\nDespite his 10-9 record, deGrom was recognized for his historic season and wasn't penalized for his lack of \"W's\" because of the poor offense behind him. Among the 58 qualifying starting pitchers this season, deGrom finished second to last in run support average (3.53). In comparison, Scherzer, with 18 wins, finished 10th (5.27), Nola 53rd (3.79).\n\nDeGrom's credentials are unprecedented. He finished with a minuscule 1.70 ERA, sixth lowest among qualifiers since the mound was lowered to its current height in 1969. It's the second-best ERA by a starting pitcher this decade -- Zack Greinke finished with a 1.66 ERA in 2016.\n\nOpponents hit .142 with one home run in 150 plate appearances with runners in scoring position. Even more remarkably, he had 18 starts in which he went at least six innings and allowed one or zero earned runs, and set a record with 29 straight starts allowing three runs or fewer.\n\nFor the season, he finished second behind Scherzer in the NL in strikeouts (269) \u2013 fourth-most in Mets history \u2013 innings (217) and WHIP (0.91).\n\n\"Obviously (Max) Scherzer and (Aaron) Nola had great seasons, but for Jake to go out there and do what he did without getting run support and have to pitch through bad defense, there were very few pitches that were kind of under no-stress,\" catcher Devin Mesoraco said in a phone interview with USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"Every outing, the tying run was at the plate or in the on-deck circle, and it makes what Jacob did even more impressive.\"\n\n2018 NL Cy Young: Jacob deGrom.\n\n\n\nFull voting details: https://t.co/MA26uVnQg6 \u2014 BBWAA (@officialBBWAA) November 14, 2018\n\nScherzer, the three-time and reigning NL Cy Young winner, had arguably his most dominant season. He led the majors in strikeouts (300) and innings pitched (220 \u2154). Neither the Nationals nor Mets had a successful season, which ultimately favored deGrom.\n\nNola went 17-6 in 33 starts. He ranked second in the NL in ERA (2.37), fifth in strikeouts (224) and opponents' batting average (.197).\n\nIn claiming the award, deGrom becomes the first Mets pitcher to win since R.A. Dickey in 2012.\n\n\"I don't know how anybody ever beats him,\" said Atlanta Braves manager Brian Snitker after deGrom's final start, an eight-inning shutout performance at Citi Field. \"You don't like to face him. But you know what? When you do face him, man, you appreciate what he is and what he can do.\"\n\nContributing: Matt Ehalt\n\nFollow Boeck on Twitter @scott_boeck", "", "FILE - In this Nov. 8, 2018, file photo, Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Vance McDonald (89) runs with the ball during the team's NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers in Pittsburgh.

The Steelers scored on seven of their first eight possessions; the only time they failed to do so was when they took a knee before halftime to run out the clock.\n\n\"It's not something that happens a lot around here,\" Kuechly said of surrendering 52 points.\n\nThings have gone so well for Carolina on defense in recent years that the last two coordinators left to take head coaching jobs \u2014 Sean McDermott in Buffalo and Steve Wilks in Arizona.\n\nBut things aren't going so well for Eric Washington, Carolina's third defensive coordinator in three seasons.\n\nThe Panthers are 15th in the league overall and 31st in red zone defense.\n\nWashington said a \"myriad of things\" went wrong against the Steelers.\n\n\"We had execution issues,\" said Washington, the team's defensive line coach from 2011-2017. \"... We have calls, we have leverage, we have gap responsibility. We have things that we have to do from one down to the next in terms of our assignment. And we did not get that done.\"\n\nWashington's body of work as a defensive line coach was impressive.\n\nSince 2012, the Panthers have more gotten more sacks from their defensive linemen (234) than any team in the league. So for the Panthers to have only 22 sacks this season is disappointing to him.\n\n\"We're his pride and joy,\" defensive tackle Kawann Short said. \"That's one of those things where he demands more out of us, and he knows what every guy in that room is capable of.\"\n\nThe Panthers didn't watch game film from Steelers loss as a team, instead electing to move on to preparations for Detroit. But Short said it feels like players are trying to do too much on their own instead of playing as a team.\n\n\"We just need to light our hair on fire, and just go,\" Short said.\n\nWashington called the Steelers game an \"anomaly,\" guaranteeing the Panthers will rectify their problems.\n\nWhen players returned from a long weekend off he reminded them of this team's long-standing identity as a defensive power, as well as the amount of talent in the locker room. Along with defensive end Julius Peppers, Kuechly has a chance to be a Hall of Famer.\n\n\"We have a high opinion of what we should be able to do every time we step on the football field,\" Washington said.\n\nKuechly said now it's time to focus on Detroit.\n\n\"One game doesn't define a season,\" Kuechly said. \"And I don't think you can waste time thinking about something in the past when you play a good team this week.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nWarriors forward Kevin Durant will become a free agent next season. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWhen Kevin Durant decided to join the Golden State Warriors during free agency in the summer of 2016, he ended up signing a one-plus-one contract.\n\nA one-plus-one deal is a two-year contract, but it allows the player to become a free agent after one season if he chooses. It\u2019s a move LeBron James popularized when he returned to Cleveland in 2014, and it works for the player in two ways.\n\nThat deal allows a player to sign for more money the following season \u2013 even with the same team \u2013 if there\u2019s a significant spike in the NBA\u2019s salary cap. It also gives the player more freedom in free agency. He isn\u2019t locked into a long-term deal and can explore options sooner and more frequently.\n\nThat ability to become a free agent season after season is a root problem of the Draymond Green-Kevin Durant dust-up that threatens to torpedo the good thing Golden State has going.\n\nThe recent confrontation stems from an end-of-the-game play Monday against the Los Angeles Clippers in which Green committed a turnover as the fourth quarter expired. Durant, who had a 30-point triple-double, clamored for the basketball. Durant expressed his frustration at the end of regulation, and Green lashed out with the disagreement continuing after Golden State\u2019s overtime loss. According to The Athletic, Green called Durant an expletive and chastised him for dangling his contract situation over the franchise\u2019s collective head.\n\nAh yes, the contract. Durant chose free agency again in 2017 after helping Golden State to a title and re-resigned on another one-plus-one deal. He took the free agency route again in July after helping the Warriors to a second consecutive title in 2018 and re-signed another one-plus-one deal.\n\nDurant can become a free agent again after this season, creating the contractual turmoil and roster uncertainty that Golden State has been able to avoid with other players.\n\nThat kind of deal is good for the player but not always good for the team, which can feel like a hostage \u2013 always wondering if this is the player\u2019s last season. But Durant earned that right. He\u2019s an MVP and two-time Finals MVP. Not many players \u2013 perhaps only the top five players in the league \u2013 can pull off the one-plus-one deals season after season. Most players want the long-term security and guaranteed money.\n\nBut Durant and James can do it because of their unbelievable talents and because they have other sources of significant income such as endorsement deals and investments.\n\nMORE NBA:\n\nDurant\u2019s contract situation is a constant topic as Golden State tries to minimize distractions and win another title, adding to their dynasty. It doesn\u2019t make the situation any easier with increasing speculation that Durant will leave after this season. Multiple Eastern Conference executives are bracing for Durant to sign with the New York Knicks in July.\n\nIt leaves Golden State in a predicament. In some way, they must cater to the superstar, and in the case of Durant vs. Green, they have to choose a side, if they want the superstar to return. As good and integral as Green is, he\u2019s not Durant. If a team had to choose one or the other, a team chooses Durant.\n\nBy suspending Green one game without pay, they run the risk of alienating Green while trying to appease Durant.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Green and Durant have butted heads. How the two players and the team emerge from this recent dust-up will impact this season. But no matter which direction the relationship goes, Durant\u2019s contract still hangs over the team\u2019s present and future.\n\nFollow Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "", "CLOSE Attorney Michael Avenatti has been released from police custody following his arrest on a felony domestic violence charge in Los Angeles.

(AP Photo/James Kenney) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Marcus Mariota and the Tennessee Titans finally are starting to show signs that some of their growing pains of learning a new offense may be easing.\n\nThe quarterback had to learn his third new scheme going into his fourth NFL season. The Titans are leaning on a lot of young receivers and coordinator Matt LaFleur's experience calling plays grows with each game. The changes, along with the loss of three-time Pro Bowl tight end Delanie Walker in the opener, led to some early struggles on offense.\n\nNow Mariota is feeling comfortable enough with the offense and LaFleur to speak up when the game plan features something he doesn't like.\n\n\"I just feel as though I've gotten a better understanding of the offense, why we're calling certain things,\" Mariota said Wednesday. \"Maybe why he wants a particular play against certain coverage, so having that understanding I think has allowed me to have confidence in going in and saying, 'Hey, maybe I don't really like that. I'm not feeling that.'\"\n\nMariota said previously he might not have known how a play would look or work on the field.\n\n\"Having confidence in it, being in the offense a little longer has definitely helped that,\" Mariota said.\n\nThe results might not show up in NFL rankings with the Titans (5-4) 30th in total offense and 18th averaging 18.7 points a game.\n\nThe offensive turnaround started Oct. 21 in London in a 20-19 loss to the Chargers and includes a 28-14 win in Dallas and last weekend's 34-10 rout of the Patriots. In those three games, the Titans have converted 61 percent (25 of 41) of their third downs, which is best in the NFL in that span.\n\nMariota has posted his best passer ratings of the season in each of the past two games, and he has 542 total yards passing, running and catching with five touchdowns. His lone interception in the three-game stretch came in the second quarter against the Chargers\n\nCorey Davis finished with seven catches for 125 yards against Dallas, his second 100-yard receiving game this season. Tight end Jonnu Smith had a career-high 45 yards receiving on three catches with a TD. Even rookie Cameron Batson, who spent three weeks on the practice squad earlier this season, has had four catches for 47 yards over the past two games.\n\nRunning back Dion Lewis believes everyone has gotten comfortable with each other.\n\n\"It's a lot of bumps in the road when you're learning,\" Lewis said. \"You make a mistake, and you try not to make the same mistake again. I think that's what everybody's trying to do knowing what the coaches expect from them. And if they messed up something in the past, just move on forward and not make that same mistake. I think if guys do that, we can keep building on that as an offense and keep getting better.\"\n\nThe results are easy to see with the Titans, who went through an eight-quarter drought without scoring a touchdown during a three-game skid in October. They followed up a season-high 28 points in Dallas with the best first quarter (17) and first half (24) of scoring since Nov. 13, 2016, against Green Bay.\n\nThe Titans are 13th in the NFL holding the ball 30 minutes, 30 seconds per game. They're also 10th converting third downs, and they'll test their comfort level Sunday when they visit the Colts (4-5) in a key AFC South game.\n\n\"We've done a good job on third downs, definitely done a whole lot better in the red zone being able to score touchdowns,\" Mariota said. \"If we can continue that, I think we got a chance to be pretty good.\"\n\nNotes: LB Wesley Woodyard was named the AFC defensive player of the week after 1 \u00bd sacks against the Patriots. ...

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFRISCO, Texas (AP) \u2014 Ezekiel Elliott paused and lowered his voice when asked what he was doing when the Dallas Cowboys played without their star running back for the first time during his six-game suspension last year.\n\nNot only was Elliott having a self-described \"tough time\" with the NFL's ban over domestic violence allegations finally in place after weeks of court battles, but he had to watch a dreadful offensive showing by the Cowboys in a blowout loss to Atlanta. The 27-7 defeat started a three-game losing streak that wiped out any realistic playoff hopes.\n\n\"I was home watching it,\" Elliott said Wednesday. \"Tough to watch. Tough time for me. I'm glad I'm out there this year and able to help my guys go out there and try to get this win.\"\n\nIt's relevant because the Cowboys (4-5) are visiting the Falcons (4-5) again Sunday, nearly in the same spot on the schedule, in more dire need of a win because of an uneven first-half performance, particularly by the offense.\n\nJust like last year, though \u2014 when Elliott refused upon his return to the team to discuss already-public details about his time away \u2014 Elliott didn't last long talking about the drama surrounding his suspension, and the impact it had on the Cowboys.\n\n\"That's all behind me,\" he said. \"It's hard to even need extra motivation when you're 4-5. For the rest of this season, our backs are up against the wall. We have to do the best we can to go out there and try to win every one of these last games. And those guys on their side, they're feeling the same way.\"\n\nThe next two questions were brushed aside. \"I really don't want to dwell on last year,\" Elliott said.\n\nFour-time Pro Bowl right guard Zack Martin didn't even remember last year's Atlanta game was the first without Elliott.\n\n\"I know you guys want to talk about it,\" Martin said. \"That really hasn't come up at all this year.\"\n\nElliott and the Dallas offense have had a rough season, even with a running game that has ranked in the top five most of the season.\n\nBut the 2016 NFL rushing champion as a rookie is coming off one of his best games of the year in a season-saving 27-20 win at defending champion Philadelphia. Elliott had 151 yards rushing with a touchdown and 36 yards receiving with another score \u2014 and a TD he lost by stumbling in the open field after almost cleanly hurdling a defender and landing in stride.\n\n\"You do have a little bit more momentum,\" Elliott said. \"When you have a game like that last week, this Falcons team is going to be that much more clued into the run. It's not going to be easy.\"\n\nThe Cowboys recovered from the downer of losing Elliott to win the last three without him last season. Then they compounded the disappointment by losing his first game back to Seattle when Dallas still had faint playoff hopes.\n\nThat defeat eliminated the Cowboys a year after an NFC-best 13 wins during the remarkable debut seasons for Elliott and quarterback Dak Prescott, the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.\n\nFast-forward a year, and Elliott is still second in the league with 831 yards rushing despite an offense ranked 27th overall, and a group of blockers that has struggled since losing four-time Pro Bowl center Travis Frederick to a nerve disorder before the season started. Frederick's return this season looks less likely each week.\n\n\"I think he's handled it all really, really well,\" coach Jason Garrett said of Elliott . \"He wants to be a great player, wants to have a big impact on our team. I thought he handled a lot of the distractions last year very well. He came back from them and now he's focused on those same things that we always thought he was all about.\"\n\nAnd happy to be playing the Falcons instead of watching from home.\n\nNOTES: LT Tyron Smith was added to the injury report with a back issue Wednesday.

One week after signing, then losing receiver Dez Bryant to an injury, the Saints welcomed another aging star, Brandon Marshall, to their receiver corps. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMETAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Brandon Marshall takes nothing for granted when discussing his opportunity to join the Saints' seemingly inevitable march to the postseason.\n\n\"Let's not jump ahead. I've got a lot of learning to do and a lot of catching up,\" Marshall said after his first practice with New Orleans on Wednesday. \"I've been at the top and I'm on the bottom right now.\"\n\nBy bottom, the 34-year-old Marshall means getting cut repeatedly in the past couple seasons, most recently by Seattle a couple weeks ago.\n\nEven after he worked out for New Orleans (8-1) last week, Marshall wasn't the Saints' top choice. New Orleans went instead with Dez Bryant, but lost the former Dallas Cowboys star to a season-ending Achilles injury in his second practice.\n\n\"When you're on the other side of 30 and you don't produce, this is the situation you'll find yourself in,\" Marshall said. \"Being cut two times in a year is interesting. It built a lot of character. ... When Seattle cut me, I just continued to work out, stay in shape and have faith.\"\n\nMarshall had flown back to his temporary home in Seattle after his Saints tryout, only to hop back on a flight to New Orleans again on Sunday afternoon, while the offense he was about to join was putting up 51 points in Cincinnati.\n\nAnkle and toe injuries cost Marshall most of his 2017 season with the New York Giants, who didn't bring him back, leaving him free to sign with the Seahawks. Marshall said he wasn't full healthy until around Week 3 or 4 of this season which, ironically, was about the time his snap count began to plummet in Seattle.\n\n\"I know that the narrative is that I'm done,\" Marshall said.\n\nYet Marshall predicted he'd demonstrate in practice that between his 6-foot-5 frame, route-running, strong hands, and ability to quickly grasp offensive schemes, that he can still help a team with playoff credentials. Marshall noted that because he played in Chicago under then-offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer, a former offensive assistant to Saints coach Sean Payton, he is familiar with New Orleans' scheme.\n\nPayton called Marshall's ability to process a play book \"one of his strengths,\" adding that he expects Marshall's transition in New Orleans \"to be pretty smooth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Marshall described the opportunity to play with Saints record-setting QB Drew Brees \"a wide receiver's dream.\" Likewise, Brees was quick to throw a few compliments Marshall's way.\n\n\"He's a smart, veteran guy who is very fluid. I've seen him in a lot of different offenses \u2014 seen him be successful both as an outside receiver, an inside receiver. He's very versatile. He's a big target. A big catching radius. Just watching him run today, he's pretty impressive.\n\n\"We talked for a while today,\" Brees added. \"He's excited. We're excited to have him.\"\n\nMarshall's addition adds depth to an offense that already leads the NFL in scoring with 36.7 points per game and ranks in the top five in yards per game with 413.9.\n\nSeattle released Marshall on Oct. 30 after he'd appeared in the first seven games this season, catching 11 passes for 136 yards and one touchdown. But he had just two catches for 16 yards in his last four games.\n\nSeattle was the sixth NFL team for Marshall, who has eight 1,000-plus-yard seasons in his career. His best season, statistically, came with the New York Jets in 2015, when he caught 109 passes for 1,502 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n\nEven now, Marshall insisted, his motivation remains to achieve \"greatness.\"\n\n\"There's no reason why, with technology and modern medicine and with access we have to doctors around the world, why athletes can't play into their mid-30s or their 40s,\" Marshall said, stressing that he now feels \"fit as a fiddle and healthy as a trout.\"\n\nIt's not yet clear whether Marshall will play much, if at all this Sunday against Philadelphia. But Eagles coach Doug Pederson said his defense has to be prepared for the possibility.\n\n\"He's, I think, a red-zone threat with his size and so I think that's where we'll see him a little bit, is down there,\" Pederson said. \"He's another big, physical receiver, hard to defend and our guys definitely have their work cut out this week.\"\n\nNotes: Starting left tackle Terron Armstead did not practice.

(AP) \u2014 Case Keenum is off to a rocky start in the shadows of John Elway, Peyton Manning and the Rocky Mountains, which he and his wife, Kimberly, visited during the Broncos' much-needed bye week.\n\n\"It's pretty. I've been looking at them for the last six months,\" Keenum said. \"So, it was fun to go up there and enjoy that. It was good to get away.\"\n\nNot that he was scrambling from the pressure and high expectations of playing in quarterback-crazed Denver, the magnitude of which he insists doesn't faze him.\n\n\"Yeah, there's a lot to it, playing quarterback here, and I enjoy it, I love it, I love the intensity of it. I love the tradition, the history,\" Keenum told The Associated Press on his way to the weight room after practice Wednesday.\n\nAs if on cue, Keenum triggered an automatic door leading from the facility to the parking lot that separates the weight room from the rest of the team's headquarters.\n\nHe pointed to the larger-than-life photos of Broncos greats that decorate the walls and halls of the UC Health Center.\n\n\"I mean, you walk in and the pictures are right there of who's played here and what they've done,\" Keenum said. \"So, I don't take it lightly. I love my job. I love what I do. Personally, I feel like I've got the best job in the world.\"\n\nEven though it comes with such little patience from the boo-birds at the stadium and the longtime listeners/first-time callers smarting over the Broncos' 3-6 start, Keenum's 10 interceptions and two dozen sacks in his Denver debut.\n\nKeenum knew Denver was different from his other NFL stops when he signed with the Broncos for two years and $36 million after leading the Vikings to the NFC championship game.\n\n\"I love it.

I'd rather them be that way than nobody shows up. I'd rather play in front of all those fans that are into the game than just some other fans \u2014 not to mention any other fans out there \u2014 that come for the tailgate and the party. They want football and I appreciate that.\"\n\nBut for three plays, the Broncos could be 6-3 instead of 3-6 heading into their game against the Chargers (7-2) this weekend.\n\n\u2014 Keenum missed a wide-open Demaryius Thomas for the game-winning TD in the final minute of a 27-23 loss to Kansas City that helped grow the legend of Patrick Mahomes.\n\n\u2014 Emmanuel Sanders' taunting flag after an apparent touchdown cost Denver four points in a 23-20 loss to the Rams.\n\n\u2014 Brandon McManus pushed a 51-yard field goal wide right as time expired in a 19-17 loss to the Texans.\n\nWith the Broncos flirting with back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 1971-72, fans are left wondering whether Keenum is the answer at quarterback or if there was anything to general manager John Elway going to watch Oregon QB Justin Herbert last month.\n\nThey've seen a succession of quarterbacks flame out in Denver following Manning's retirement a month after the Broncos' Super Bowl parade 33 months ago:\n\n\u2014 Mark Sanchez was cut in camp.\n\n\u2014 Trevor Siemian kept getting hurt and eventually was traded.\n\n\u2014 Brock Osweiler was brought back in 2017 but not re-signed in 2018.\n\n\u2014 Paxton Lynch, a first-round bust.\n\n\u2014 Chad Kelly, a backup who got arrested.\n\nIf the Broncos had beaten the Chiefs (9-1), Rams (9-1) and Texans (6-3), maybe the buzz is all about a long-term extension for Keenum instead of whether he's the right quarterback to lead the Broncos' revival.\n\n\"That's not in my mind,\" Keenum said. \"During the season I'm taking it one game at a time.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson have faced off in a few memorable games in Seattle, from the \"Fail Mary\" to an unforgettable NFC championship game that sent the Seahawks to their second straight Super Bowl.\n\nFor the fifth straight regular season \u2014 and the seventh time overall since 2012 \u2014 Green Bay and Seattle will meet again on Thursday night, but this time it's positioning in a jumbled NFC playoff picture at stake.\n\nWashington, New Orleans, Chicago and the Los Angeles Rams are the division leaders in the NFC, leaving a pile of seven teams \u2014 including Seattle and Green Bay \u2014 within a couple of games of each other likely competing for the two wild-card spots. And every advantage or tiebreaker in that race \u2014 such as a head-to-head victory \u2014 could end up being crucial.\n\n\"I know that this team is very, very capable of doing what we're setting out to do,\" Wilson said. \"I think everybody should watch out (for) what we can do.\"\n\nSeattle (4-5) has dropped two straight after winning four of the previous five, and hasn't lost three straight since the middle of the 2011 season. Green Bay (4-4-1) snapped a two-game losing streak with a 31-12 thumping of Miami last week.\n\nThe \"Fail Mary\" in 2012, the 2014 season opener when Seattle raised its Super Bowl banner and the NFC title game after the 2014 season are the only three times Rodgers has lost to the Seahawks in his career.\n\nThe past two matchups with Seattle have been among Rodgers' best, throwing for 311 yards in a 17-9 win to open last season and in 2016 posting a 150.8 passer rating in a 38-10 Green Bay rout.\n\nHe also has the distinction of having won in Seattle \u2014 although that came 10 years ago.\n\n\"It's a tough environment like I said but we've definitely done it before,\" Rodgers said. \"You've just got to start fast, take care of the football. They're very good at turning the ball over. I know this is different personnel on their side of the ball than we've seen over the years, but they're still playing really well.\"\n\nRodgers and Wilson are being helped this year by improved run games that are among the best in the league. Green Bay's Aaron Jones leads the NFL in yards per carry, while Seattle has the No. 1 rushing offense and last week rushed for 273 yards against the Rams without starting running back Chris Carson.\n\nHere's what else to watch for on Thursday night:\n\nFIRST UP\n\nSeattle expects Carson to be available after missing last Sunday's game with a hip injury. If Carson can go, he will be the starter. But Seattle finally saw the promise of rookie first-round pick Rashaad Penny last week when he rushed for 108 yards on 12 carries and a touchdown. Penny showed the burst and big-play ability that had been missing through the first half of the season.\n\nExpect Penny to get additional chances no matter Carson's health as the Seahawks look to use its three-back trio \u2014 Carson, Penny, Mike Davis \u2014 all of whom have 100-yard rushing games this season.\n\nSECONDARY MATTERS\n\nAnother week, another lineup shuffle likely in the Green Bay secondary. Kentrell Brice was walking in the locker room with a boot on his left foot early in the week, making it appear unlikely that he will be ready to go on a short turnaround.\n\nThe Packers traded Ha Ha Clinton-Dix to Washington two weeks ago. Jermaine Whitehead was released last week. No Brice would mean probably mean veteran Tramon Williams and second-year player Josh Jones starting at safety. Kevin King (hamstring) also appears likely to miss another game, while fellow cornerback Bashaud Breeland (groin) was limited during the week.\n\nHERE'S JIMMY\n\nTight end Jimmy Graham is returning to Seattle for the first time since signing with the Packers as a free agent in the offseason. With just two touchdowns so far this year, Graham perhaps hasn't had quite the impact in the end zone as in 2017, when he had 10 scores with Seattle.\n\nBut with 33 catches through nine games, Graham in on pace to match the production he had with the Seahawks. He's also taking pride in his run-blocking, and his part in helping Aaron Jones run for career highs of 145 yards and two scores last week.\n\n\"I know everybody knows me for running go routes and snagging touchdowns, but I think I've dedicated myself to the run, to being a part of that because I'm a tight end now,\" Graham said on Sunday. \"For us to be successful I've got to do those things and I've got to be good at them.\"\n\nQUICK TURNAROUND\n\nBecause of the quick turnaround from last Sunday several players have been ruled out. Along with Brice and King, the Packers have also ruled out wide receiver Randall Cobb and linebacker Nick Perry.\n\nSeattle linebacker K.J. Wright was listed as doubtful because of a knee injury that knocked him out of last Sunday's game early. Carroll said Wright would be a game-time decision. Seattle sat Carson and guard D.J. Fluker against the Rams and both appear set to play against the Packers.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

DeGrom won the National League Cy Young Award on Wednesday, Nov. 14. (AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After a season marred by narrow defeats, Jacob deGrom became a runaway winner.\n\nThe New York Mets ace easily won the National League Cy Young Award on Wednesday night, a reward for a historically fruitless season in Flushing. The right-hander had just 10 victories, the fewest ever by a Cy Young-winning starter.\n\nThe AL prize also reflected a change in voters' values, with Blake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays narrowly beating out past winners Justin Verlander and Corey Kluber for his first Cy Young. Snell pitched just 180 2/3 innings, fewest ever by a Cy Young-winning starter. Over full seasons, Snell is the second starter to win the award with fewer than 200 innings after Clayton Kershaw logged 198 1/3 in 2014.\n\n\"I definitely think the game has changed in that aspect,\" deGrom said.\n\n\"I feel like it's just turning more into quality of work and what did you accomplish in those innings,\" Snell said. \"I think that's just the way it's going.\"\n\nDeGrom easily beat out Washington's Max Scherzer, who was seeking a third straight Cy Young and fourth overall. DeGrom got 29 first-place votes and 207 points from members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Scherzer had the other first-place vote.\n\nIn his first season after chopping off his distinctive long hair, deGrom cut down hitters from start to finish despite little help from teammates. He had a 1.70 ERA, the lowest in the NL since Zack Greinke's 1.66 mark in 2015. Yet the 30-year-old right-hander went 10-9, eclipsing the low bar among starters of 13 victories set by the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela in 1981 and matched by Seattle's Felix Hernandez in 2010.\n\nDeGrom allowed three runs or fewer in 29 consecutive starts to close the season, breaking Leslie \"King\" Cole's 108-year-old record of 26 such outings. Yet the Mets were 11-18 in those games and 14-18 overall with deGrom on the mound.\n\n\"My thought process was, 'Hey, take the ball every fifth day and continue to try to put this team in position to win and control what you can control,'\" deGrom said.\n\nHernandez's Cy Young victory signaled a major shift from voters, who once prioritized pitcher wins. The push toward advanced analytics made deGrom's candidacy possible, and by September there was little debate deGrom was worthy, even as the Mets regularly wasted his dominance.\n\n\"This was one of my goals,\" deGrom said. \"The team didn't end up where we wanted to be this past season, but you kind of set personal goals, and I think being able to accomplish something that has been a dream of yours is just something special. To be a Cy Young Award winner, you're in great company, and it truly is an honor.\"\n\nPerhaps no pitcher had ever been such a hard-luck loser. New York averaged 3.5 runs in games started by deGrom, second only to Cole Hamels for worst support in the majors among qualified pitchers. During one stretch late in the season, the Mets totaled 10 runs over seven of deGrom's outings, and four of those were driven in by the pitcher himself.\n\nDeGrom nearly produced more wins above replacement than actual wins \u2014 an unfortunate sabermetric feat that has only been accomplished once, when the Philadelphia Athletics' Eddie Smith went 4-17 with 4.1 WAR in 1937. Baseball-Reference calculated deGrom for 9.6 WAR.\n\nThe 2014 NL Rookie of the Year, he became the seventh rookie winner voted a Cy Young, joining fellow Mets Tom Seaver and Dwight Gooden. R.A. Dickey was the only other Met to win a Cy Young.\n\nThe Mets unveiled a deGrom bobblehead featuring the Cy Young Award shortly after deGrom was crowned. They will give away 25,000 prior to a home game April 7 against Scherzer's Nationals.\n\nSnell got 17 first-place votes and 169 points to 13 first-place votes and 154 points for Verlander. Kluber had 71 points, followed by Boston's Chris Sale and Houston's Gerrit Cole.\n\nSnell had a 1.89 ERA, third best in the AL since the DH was introduced, trailing only Ron Guidry (1.74) in 1978 and Pedro Martinez (1.74) in 2000. The 25-year-old pitched had 33 1/3 fewer innings than Verlander, but his dominance was enough to sway the electorate.\n\nThe lefty nicknamed Snellzilla wreaked havoc against the AL's top lineups. He was 3-0 with a 1.08 ERA in four starts against the World Series champion Red Sox, and 2-0 in two starts each against the Astros and Indians. The Yankees roughed Snell up twice, but he got threw five scoreless innings in a victory Aug. 16. That came during a late-season run of nine consecutive wins for Snell, including a victory against every team in the AL East. He also made five starts against former Cy Young winners and went 3-0 with an 0.59 ERA.\n\nSnell was the first player 25-or-younger to win 21 games since Barry Zito in 2002. He was highly regarded as a minor leaguer for his electric arsenal, but subpar control led to struggles during his first two major league seasons. He was even demoted to Triple-A for a month in 2017.\n\nIt all came together this year. Snell was a stalwart for a most unusual pitching staff, taking the ball every fifth day while manager Kevin Cash successfully experimented with reliever \"openers\" to start games in between. Snell led the Rays with 31 starts, and no other traditional starter had more than 17. After longtime franchise ace Chris Archer was traded to the Pirates on July 31, Snell went 9-0 with a 1.17 ERA.\n\n\"I felt with the opener, I had a bigger role on the team,\" Snell said.\n\nSnell is the second Rays pitcher to win the award, following David Price in 2012.\n\nScherzer went 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and led the majors with 220 2/3 innings and 300 strikeouts. He was attempting to become the first player since Randy Johnson to win three consecutive Cy Youngs. He got the first-place vote of John Maffei of the San Diego Union-Tribune, 29 seconds and 123 points. Aaron Nola of the Philadelphia Phillies was third with 86 points, followed by Colorado's Kyle Freeland and Arizona's Patrick Corbin.\n\nVerlander led the AL with 290 strikeouts while going 16-9 with a 2.52 ERA for AL West champion Houston. This is his third second-place finish since winning the Cy Young and MVP in 2011 with Detroit.\n\nKluber was attempting to win his second straight Cy Young and third overall. He went 20-7 with a 2.89 ERA for AL Central champion Cleveland and led the AL with 215 innings.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jake Seiner: https://twitter.com/Jake_Seiner\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Tenally, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nASHBURN, Va. (AP) \u2014 Home sweet home? Not so much for Redskins players right now.\n\nEven though Washington has won three of five home games this season and leads the NFC East, cornerback Josh Norman called out Redskins fans in the aftermath of an ugly victory at Tampa Bay and said he felt they played better on the road. In the process, he put the spotlight on the atmosphere Sunday at FedEx Field when the AFC South-leading Houston Texans come to town.\n\nNorman said home games are \"like the other team's turf\" because of an infusion of opposing fans and opined that Redskins fans \"just boo everything and aren't really behind us.\" Teammates hope that sentiment works to provide a spark of energy for the rest of the year.\n\n\"We have a really good team and what it comes down to is myself and Josh, we want to be backed up, and we don't want it to feel like it's 50/50 when we're at our home field and they have as many fans as we do,\" running back Chris Thompson said. \"We just want everybody to be there. That's it. We want our fans to be out there and just have our backs.\"\n\nThe Redskins organization began a concerted effort in the offseason to try to improve the fan experience at the stadium in suburban Maryland. Aware a sellout streak the team boasted had lasted the past 50 seasons would end, the decision was made to stop selling as many tickets to brokers and try to draw back in some of the disillusioned fans of a franchise that has just three playoff victories since its last Super Bowl title from the 1991 season.\n\nWashington's average attendance of 61,201 ranks 26th in the NFL, and its 74.6 percent-of-capacity crowd ranks dead last. Chief marketing officer Steve Ziff said prior to the season there's no timeline for when he expects fans to return in droves like the glory days at RFK Stadium.\n\n\"We're going to do things right for as long as it takes,\" Ziff said. \"Every day the goal is to do things right and hopefully over time, win or lose, fans will buy into that.\"\n\nRight now, the Redskins are winning. At 6-3, they're two games up in the division and on pace for their first postseason appearance since 2015.\n\nBut Thompson, who has been with the team since 2013, understands there are long-term issues under the surface leading to fans staying away. Decades of mediocre on-field performance, polarizing opinions about owner Dan Snyder and the location of FedEx Field are all factors that have nothing to do with the current roster and its wins and losses.\n\n\"All the responses I see all the time is, 'We've been fans for 10-plus years, we've been fans for 25 years \u2014 whatever the case may be \u2014 and we haven't gotten any results (and) the Redskins have been terrible,'\" Thompson said. \"I've been here for six years. I understand. I know. I've been to one playoff game in six years.\"\n\nIf the Redskins win the division and host a playoff game, the stands will be rocking like the old days \u2014 especially if Kirk Cousins and the Minnesota Vikings are the opponent. But to get there, they could use a boost at home so players don't feel like they're in unfriendly confines.\n\nFor quarterback Alex Smith, it's all about the cadence and ability to communicate verbally.\n\n\"The big thing offensively is communication that you can count on,\" Smith said Wednesday. \"To be at home and be able to communicate, I think you can do more in the huddle and do more at the line of scrimmage.\"\n\nOn defense, it's the opposite. The Redskins are coming off allowing 501 yards but only three points to the Buccaneers, and they're counting on noise against DeShaun Watson and the Texans, who have won six in a row since an 0-3 start.\n\n\"The fans play a big part in the way defenses can play, in the way the atmosphere is out there,\" linebacker Mason Foster said. \"When you get those guys going crazy in the stands, it's hard for quarterbacks to communicate, it's hard for them to audible at the line. When you get that going, I think it's a tough place to play at FedEx.\"\n\nNOTES: Coach Jay Gruden said left tackle Trent Williams (thumb) won't play Sunday and there's a good chance Thompson (ribs) is out, too. ...

The team announced the move Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) \u2014 The Detroit Lions have allowed 16 sacks in the past two games \u2014 and this week isn't off to a good start either for the offensive line.\n\nThe Lions put guard T.J. Lang on injured reserve with a neck injury Wednesday. Lang has missed three games this season, including last weekend's loss at Chicago. Detroit signed cornerback Mike Ford to the active roster from the practice squad and signed safety David Jones to the practice squad.\n\n\"He was a good veteran leader,\" center Graham Glasgow said. \"All of us will need to pick up the slack a little bit on that end.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Lang is in his second season with the Lions after playing eight with Green Bay. Lang signed a three-year deal with Detroit before the 2017 season, returning to his home area. He was born in Royal Oak, went to high school in Bloomfield Hills and went to college at Eastern Michigan.\n\nLang hasn't played a full 16 games since the 2014 season, but he's also never played fewer than 12 in his career. That obviously changes now. Lang has also dealt with back, concussion and hip problems this year.\n\nGuard Kenny Wiggins, who signed with the Lions in March, has started the three games that Lang missed so far this season.\n\n\"Same way I always approach it,\" Wiggins said. \"I've been preparing all year like I was a starter. Now it's just how it's going to be now from now on.\"\n\nDetroit (3-6) has lost three straight. The Lions yielded 10 sacks against Minnesota two weekends ago and six against the Bears.\n\n\"It just hasn't been our best performances,\" Glasgow said. \"Part of it has just been the situations that have been, just throughout the game. Down by a few scores, trying to come back and get some points on the board. It's a lot of pass pro, a lot of pass rush.\"\n\nThe Lions have invested a lot in recent years to try to improve their offensive line. Detroit has used four of its past seven first-round draft picks on offensive linemen. Two of those selections \u2014 Taylor Decker and rookie Frank Ragnow \u2014 have started every game for the Lions this season.\n\nLang, however, has been limited, and his future seems uncertain. Detroit's running game has improved a bit, but the sack totals have stood out over the past two weeks.

But it took a long time \u2013 it wasn\u2019t some snap (decision).\n\nQ: What specifically did you guys need to work through in order to move forward?\n\nCorgan: We haven't really discussed it because I don't think it's pertinent to the band. It was more stuff between us that went back 30 years. When you make that kind of peace with a family member, you don't sit down and say, \"Well, you know, in 1992 you hurt my feelings.\" It's really more about mending the fence and letting nature take its course. And that's kind of what happened. We got back in the business of being family again and breaking this 17-plus year wall of not talking.\n\nQ: What exactly went down between you and D'Arcy Wretzky (the band's original bassist, who left the band in 1999)? She recently shared what appear to be text messages between you two, in which you offer to have her be a part of the reunion but only in a limited capacity.\n\nCorgan: The problem is that she presented an incomplete record. Those conversations went on for years. What she presented was, a), without my permission. They were private messages. And b), because I never contextualized the messages, people just filled in their own conspiracy blank and created a narrative that isn't true. As you know, in the world we live in, you can try to correct a narrative that's already sealed in concrete and nobody listens because the narrative that they formed is far more interesting. The reality is quite boring.\n\nQ: Is there any chance you could reconcile or have those bridges been burned?\n\nCorgan: No. I\u2019ve said it repeatedly, but it\u2019s done. Done, done, done.\n\nQ: When you first reunited with the band and producer Rick Rubin, you only intended to record a single track together. How did it turn into a full-blown album?\n\nCorgan: We spent three weeks at The Village (studio) in Los Angeles doing some demos with the idea that we were going to get Rick to do just one song. We presented him eight songs and shockingly, he liked all eight. So we ended up going from recording one song with Rick to (tell fans), \u201cHey, we\u2019re back,\u201d to doing what became this record.\n\nQ: A number of reviews and write-ups about the new music have said you guys are \"recapturing\" and \"harking back to\" your old sound. Did you go back and listen to any past Pumpkins albums while making this?\n\nCorgan: I\u2019m not offended, but it's an offensive question. (Laughs.) I find that really funny, because when you do what you do, somehow it becomes retrospective. For years, I heard people complain that I was being too progressive and that I needed to get back in the room with the people who I made the music with that they liked. So I got back in the room with (those people), and then they (complained) about something else.\n\nIt\u2019s just weird, you can never satisfy something that's a ghost. The ghost of The Smashing Pumpkins is bigger than the reality of Smashing Pumpkins. The Smashing Pumpkins released 180 songs in 10 years, and a lot of songs were electronic, psychedelic, goth. I guarantee you, if we'd done something that was very electronic or goth (this time around), nobody would be talking about, \u201cOh, they\u2019re harking back to their fourth album.\u201d\n\nWe made eight songs in four weeks. That's lightning speed, so there wasn't a lot of thinking, like, \"Hey, let's put on an old album and try to get that guitar sound.\"\n\nQ: Are there any of your hits that you choose not to play live now, in part because they feel like fan service?\n\nCorgan: No. They\u2019re my songs, mostly, and I don\u2019t have a problem with any. It's more conceptual. I've complained for 20-plus years that rock 'n' roll was headed in the wrong direction, and I don't feel I was wrong. Rock 'n' roll was being neutered by the way social media worked and the way fans rose up. You see it now with the way people complain about comic books and \"Star Wars.\" They've created a culture where the fans almost create the ending, not the artists themselves. I'm not interested in being in a band that's servile to the need of a particular fan base. We're quite comfortably poised between who we were, who we are and where we're going.\n\nBilly Corgan greets fans in Anaheim, Calif., in 2016. (Photo: Jesse Grant, Getty Images for NAMM)\n\nQ: You interact a lot with your fans on Instagram. What do you like most about having that line of communication with them?\n\nCorgan: As somebody who's had my avatar stolen by the media and turned into something that I'm not, I quite like reinforcing my brand in line with who I am as a person. Probably the greatest compliment that I get from fans is, \"We like that you do this because it's your own voice. If you\u2019re being a brat, we know it\u2019s you being a brat.\" They don't wonder if it's a media contrivance.\n\nQ: Congratulations on welcoming your daughter, Philomena, last month. How does it feel to have two kids at home (including son Augustus, turning 2 this week)?\n\nCorgan: It\u2019s pretty crazy. I\u2019m almost 52, so having kids late in life has been a pretty wild adventure. I appreciate that I waited because I am really ready to be there for my children and love my children to the best of my ability. But at the same time, I also (understand) why parenting is such a difficult thing for anybody because it requires so much energy and devotion. I\u2019m in awe of any parent who does it well.\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan performing in London last month, as part of the rock band's globe-trotting reunion tour. (Photo: Rob Ball, WireImage)\n\nQ: After the current tour wraps next month, do you plan to take some time off or get right back to work?\n\nCorgan: We're already talking about tour stuff for next year, so there will be more Pumpkins shows in 2019. But for me, once we get off tour, I\u2019m either going to be doing some writing in LA with some friends or going back to Chicago to start writing new Smashing Pumpkins. I also have an inkling to try and get us to do a Christmas record one day, so I might try to use the Christmas spirit to put the record together in concept, even if we're not ready to record it.\n\nQ: Would that include covers or be all original material?\n\nCorgan: It would be a mixture. I have released two Christmas songs, and I was thinking it would be nice to re-record those in the context of the record we would make. It would be probably lean more acoustic. I would think it's a bit weird (to make) wild Christmas records. Although, I also like \"Jingle Bell Rock,\" which is basically 1950s rockabilly. But I don't know. When I think Christmas music, I tend to think something you want to put on and sit around the tree with the kids and not rock out to. I don't see us doing a rocking-out Christmas album.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/11/14/why-billy-corgan-reunited-original-smashing-pumpkins-new-album/1982257002/", "CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP Photo/John Amis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Flush with cash, the New York Yankees may take a run at Manny Machado.\n\nBut first, the slugging infielder would have some explaining to do.\n\nArriving in Atlanta for two days of owners meetings at a hotel next to the Braves' SunTrust Park, Hal Steinbrenner discussed the state of a team that has one of baseball's most dynamic young rosters but came up short in the playoffs the last two seasons.\n\nThe Yankees owner has plenty of money to spend after coming in under the luxury tax threshold last season for the first time since the penalty took effect in 2003. While the top priority is starting pitching, New York is also mentioned as a contender for one of the winter's biggest free-agent prizes.\n\nMachado is a dynamic player but comes with plenty of baggage, including the reputation as a dirty player and his admission that he's \"not the type of player that's going to be Johnny Hustle \" after he jogged out a groundball during the NL Championship Series.\n\n\"Certainly, those comments are troubling,\" Steinbrenner said during a meeting with a small group of reporters in the hotel lobby. He quickly added that it would be the job of general manager Brian Cashman to determine whether the comments would disqualify the Yankees from pursuing such a player.\n\nNew York needs a shortstop for at least the first half of 2019 after Didi Gregorius blew out his throwing elbow in Game 2 of the AL Division series , leading to Tommy John reconstructive surgery.\n\n\"If we're interested in any player, we sit down with them face to face with their agent and ask them, 'Where did this come from? What context was around the entire interview? What point were you trying to make? How do you justify it?'\" Steinbrenner said. \"Because that ain't going to sell where we play baseball.\"\n\nSteinbrenner also insisted many players with troubling reputations do just fine in New York.\n\n\"We have a great clubhouse,\" the owner said. \"They just don't put up with a lot of nonsense from players, whether it's a rookie just coming up or new players \u2014 even if they're veterans \u2014 coming in. That's a problem I'm less worried about. But makeup is a big part of what we look at. It's not just analytics.\"\n\nMachado doesn't seem to be a priority. Mimicking Cashman's recent comments at the general manager meetings in California , Steinbrenner said the shaky starting pitching must be addressed.\n\nIn a 3-1 loss to the Red Sox in the ALDS , Masahiro Tanaka was the only starter to last five innings. J.A. Happ, Luis Severino and CC Sabathia each took a loss after combining to give up 14 earned runs in eight innings, an ERA of 15.75.\n\n\"We have to add pieces,\" Steinbrenner said. \"Our starting pitching struggled in October. That was obvious. Tanaka was the only one who had good start in the Division Series, so we've got work to do.\"\n\nSteinbrenner didn't rule out another huge contract. The Yankees already have Giancarlo Stanton , who is guaranteed $270 million over the next decade unless he opts out of the deal following the 2020 season. Machado is likely to seek an even bigger deal.\n\n\"Who is the person? How old are they? What are their abilities? What is their injury history? Do we really need that particular position?\" Steinbrenner said, describing how he would approach another megadeal. \"I'm not against looking. We will leave no stone unturned.\"\n\nIn the end, the mantra is simple.\n\nWorld Series or Bust \u2014 especially after the rival Red Sox claimed the World Series championship.\n\n\"Look, our goal is to win the world championship, so it's going to hurt me no matter who it is,\" he said. \"But clearly, having our biggest rival do it hurts more. Absolutely.\"\n\nOn other subjects:\n\n\u2014 Steinbrenner said he's hopeful his late father will be selected for the Hall of Fame. George Steinbrenner is among 10 candidates on the Today's Game Era ballot , which will surely set up plenty of debate over whether seven World Series titles and 11 AL pennants are enough to offset two lengthy suspensions from the game. \"I feel he deserves to be in, and a lot of other people do too,\" Hal Steinbrenner said. \"I think it's just a matter of time.\"\n\n\u2014 The Yankees owner declined to comment on his team's plans to buy back the 80 percent stake in the YES Network sold to 21st Century Fox from 2012-14. Steinbrenner did indicate new investors likely would own a majority stake in the network, while the team retained control over content and presentation. It had a similar arrangement with Fox.\n\n\"Our ownership would be in all likelihood in the same ballpark,\" he said. \"But more important than how many points of equity we own, it's the ability to maintain control of the broadcast, the content, everything we always had, everything Fox was great at accepting.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

We will do this every week until the end of the season. The best situations are where we completely drop a team out of this article, only for them to make a last minute run. This isn\u2019t any form of power rankings. It\u2019s simply an update on where teams stand in regards to making the playoff race. We\u2019ll discuss chances at the division and also what teams are most likely to grab a wild-card berth.\n\nAFC East\n\nIs it too early to call this division over? It\u2019s never too early to call this division over. It\u2019s essentially over.\n\nNew England Patriots (7-3)\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Jets, Vikings, @ Dolphins, @ Steelers, Bills, Jets\n\nEveryone is burying the Patriots because they lost to the best scoring defense in the NFL at their field, in a big game for the Titans. Why does everyone do this to themselves? The Patriots have 3 wins left on their schedule and maybe it\u2019s four \u2014 by sweeping the division. Beat the Steelers and it\u2019s 12 wins and a bye.\n\nTom Brady was 21 of 41 for 254 yards. He had no interceptions. He is somehow losing his fastball, but that\u2019s not a bad game. People just fawned over Eli Manning throw for 180 yards against a bad Niners defense.\n\nThis is neither here nor there. The real point is the Patriots are playing for a bye still. Let\u2019s not bury them just yet.\n\nMiami Dolphins (5-5):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Colts, Bills, Patriots, @ Vikings, Jaguars, @ Bills\n\nIt just feels like the Dolphins are a .500 team. They win the games they are supposed to win. They lose the games they are supposed to lose. With their remaining games that could be 9-7. It could be 8-8 since the Colts are playing well and the Dolphins have to travel to Indy to play that game.\n\nIs Ryan Tannehill going to come back? We don\u2019t know. He probably will be rusty after missing a large portion of the season. It\u2019s also not great when the starting quarterback is having shoulder issues. Shoulders are apparently very important when throwing to receivers. The Dolphins aren\u2019t catching the Patriots unless New England absolutely implodes. They need to monitor the final wild-card spot.\n\nAFC North\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (6-2-1):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Jaguars, @ Broncos, Chargers, @ Raiders, Patriots, @ Saints, Bengals\n\nThe Steelers now know they won\u2019t have Le\u2019Veon Bell at all this season. That\u2019s fine since James Conner has been pretty darn good anyway. This version of the Steelers team \u2014 not the version that started the season \u2014 should beat the Jaguars and Broncos even though both games are away.\n\nThen the Steelers enter an absolutely brutal stretch of their schedule. The Chargers are good and could be the second best team in the AFC. There are rumors Hunter Henry may even come back. The Raiders are going to be a cakewalk but then the Steelers end their season against rival New England and at New Orleans. Pittsburgh wants a bye \u2014 it would be a lot easier to beat the Patriots at Heinz Field \u2014 but they have to play mistake-free football to do so.\n\nCincinnati Bengals (5-4):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Ravens, Browns, Broncos, @ Chargers, Raiders, @ Browns, @ Steelers\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at me . . . the person who predicted the Bengals would actually win the AFC North. The best picture is probably inserting the \u201cNot great, Bob!\u201d GIF. Picture it though. That\u2019s what I look like.\n\nThe Bengals defense has been hot garbage most of the season. The reason I picked them to win the AFC North was that their defense was good enough combined with their offense to build a well-rounded team. Bad choice by me.\n\nThe Bengals should win their next three games \u2014 assuming Robert Griffin or Lamar Jackson start for the Ravens \u2014 and there is only one really difficult game remaining on their schedule. That might be a home game if Cincinnati fans travel to Los Angeles. So there is a chance, if Pittsburgh slips up, that the Bengals could host a playoff game. Let\u2019s be serious though, it is the Bengals.\n\nAFC West\n\nThis division comes down to two teams, and both should make the playoffs based off their talent.\n\nKansas City Chiefs (9-1):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Rams, @ Raiders, Ravens, Chargers, @ Seahawks, Raiders\n\nKansas City has the best record in the AFC and they get to the play the Raiders two more times. What a blessing! The Chiefs control their own destiny now that the Patriots lost to the Titans. They have a two-game lead on the Patriots. They have a 1.5 game lead on the Steelers. They have a one-game lead on the Chargers \u2014 with a head to head win to start the season.\n\nThere is no excuse for the Chiefs to not get the one seed. Even if they lose to the Rams this Monday Night \u2014 in a game that was supposed to be played in Mexico but is now at the Coliseum \u2014 they still have an easy run. Andy Reid always had the excuse that his teams had to travel in the playoffs. They most likely won\u2019t have to do so. It\u2019s time to make the Super Bowl or it\u2019s a disappointment.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (7-2):\n\nRemaining Schedule: Broncos, Cardinals, @ Steelers, Bengals, @ Chiefs, Ravens, @ Broncos\n\nSo there\u2019s a win against Denver and a win against Arizona. The Steelers game could be difficult but maybe Joey Bosa and Hunter Henry are suddenly back \u2014 Bosa is probably more likely. Let\u2019s just say the Chargers run off with four wins. They have the running game, quarterback, receiving talent, and defense to do so \u2014 really the only thing they lack is a kicker.\n\nThe Chargers could potentially be playing the Chiefs, in Kansas City, with a chance to win the AFC West, and a chance at the top seed in the AFC. Home field advantage doesn\u2019t matter much to the Chargers, but it would be nice.\n\nEven if that doesn\u2019t happen, the Chargers only need to beat the teams they should beat to make the playoffs.\n\nAFC South\n\nHouston Texans (6-3):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Redskins, Titans, Browns, Colts, @ Jets, @ Eagles, Jaguars\n\nThe Texans come off the bye the same place they were when they entered the bye: in first place of the AFC South. Their biggest game will be against the Titans in Houston. Take the under there. That game involves two amazing defenses.\n\nAs for the rest of their schedule, they shouldn\u2019t be too nervous. The Eagles may have nothing to play for by the time that game rolls around. The Browns are improving but are beatable. The Texans should beat the Colts in Houston. The Jets are a joke after being kind of frisky earlier on in the year. In fact, the Texans could be a sneaky bye team. All they need is a Patriots loss \u2014 although the Pats do have the tiebreaker against Houston \u2014 and a Pittsburgh slip up.\n\nTennessee Titans (5-4):\n\nRemaining Schedule: @ Colts, @ Texans, Jets, Jaguars, @ Giants, Redskins, Colts\n\nThis is what I said about the Titans last week:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good chance the Titans aren\u2019t on this list come next week. If they upset the Patriots then we know they truly belong. If they get blown out, they are one of those teams that aren\u2019t making the playoffs.\u201d\n\nThey won. Now they need to prove they can win a big game away from the confines of their own homes. They need to not play down to the level of their opponent. They show up in big games. Now show up in games that aren\u2019t exactly marquee. The Titans have two huge games against division opponents. They almost need to win both.\n\nOutside and Frisky\n\nBaltimore Ravens (4-5): The Ravens had a bye and dropped off the list. This is what happens when RG3 or Lamar Jackson is scheduled to start.\n\nIndianapolis Colts (4-5): The Colts are fun. They probably aren\u2019t a playoff team, but they are definitely fun again.", "TEMPE, Ariz.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 The Philadelphia Eagles are closer to being the eighth defending Super Bowl champion to follow up with a losing record than becoming the ninth team to repeat.\n\nA season that began with promise has been a major disappointment. The offense is inconsistent, the defense has wasted several leads in the second half, and a slew of injuries has left the team short-handed in key areas.\n\nStill, the Eagles (4-5) are in the mix in a mediocre NFC East.\n\n\"There is a level of frustration, but listen, we're very close,\" coach Doug Pederson said Wednesday. \"We're so close in a lot of areas. You look at our output and production offensively, we're very similar to where we were last year.\n\n\"The difference is creating turnovers on defense and then scoring in the red zone. That's kind of what's staring at us right in the face. We have to finish better, and we have to score more points.\"\n\nThe Eagles have lost three straight games at home, including 27-20 to the Cowboys (4-5). They have four games remaining against division opponents, including two versus first-place Washington (6-3). Next up is a difficult game on the road against the New Orleans Saints (8-1). Philadelphia is a 9-point underdog.\n\n\"I never want to throw around the word desperate,\" quarterback Carson Wentz said. \"We realize where we're at. We know where the division is at. We don't want to overthink anything. We have a tough matchup against a great team. We're cognizant of it. We'll go there and give our best effort.\"\n\nPederson spoke to the team's leadership committee before practice to get a sense of morale and came away optimistic.\n\n\"They're all disappointed obviously in the performance the other day,\" he said. \"They're eager to get back on the practice field and they're excited for this week and this opportunity. I think they understand what's in front of them.\n\n\"They know that the sense of urgency in practice, it's not a panic or anything other than just a sense of urgency of understanding your job, doing your job, doing it collectively, and making sure that they just focus on one play at a time. I really do feel like they're in a good place and they're positive about the future.\"\n\nThe Eagles overcame several key injuries last season on their way to a 13-3 record and the franchise's first Super Bowl title.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump on Wednesday backed a criminal justice reform plan being pushed by one of his top advisers, son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nThe \"First Step Act,\" developed by Kushner and a bipartisan group of lawmakers, is designed to improve rehabilitation programs for former prisoners and give judges more discretion in sentencing offenders for nonviolent crime, particularly drug offenders.\n\nTrump said the legislation would \"make our communities safer and give former inmates a second chance at life after they have served their time.\"\n\nProponents have sought changes for years, arguing that mandatory sentencing, including for repeat offenders, has led to excessively long imprisonment for relatively minor crimes. And they note those sentences tend to disproportionately fall on African-Americans.\n\nSupporters said they hoped the president's support could speed the legislation's approval, possibly before the new Congress is seated in January. Others were skeptical lawmakers would move that fast.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., released a joint statement praising Trump's endorsement and said it would allow the proposal's sponsors to \"quickly take a critical first step towards reforming our criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also would place federal prisoners closer to home, allow more home confinement for lower-level offenders and expand prison employment programs.\n\nTrump announced his support at a White House event where he was flanked by lawmakers and joined by Kushner, who has made criminal justice reform a centerpiece of his portfolio. Members of both parties have long predicted criminal justice reform had the potential to win bipartisan support, but it has taken years for the legislation to materialize.\n\n\"Did I hear that word 'bipartisan'? Did I hear that word? That's a nice word,\" Trump said.\n\nBut Trump also used the event to take a shot at President Bill Clinton, who signed a sweeping crime bill in 1994 that funded community police officers and drug courts but also mandated sentences for certain crimes. Trump described the latest effort as rolling back parts of the \"Clinton crime law.\"\n\nOpinion: Governors: We need bipartisan criminal justice reform to improve lives and our workforce\n\nRelated: California Gov.

Bobby Scott, D-Va., who has led criminal justice reform efforts, called for the Congressional Budget Office to study those concerns.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency around here to introduce a bill with a title, discuss the title and then go to the press conference,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said he doubted Congress would act before next year. He said he expected more action in the next session and noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who said he is likely to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed interest in the issue.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s leadership that could bring about some change,\" Cardin said. \"We need to do it. We\u2019re losing too many of our people. It\u2019s ridiculous.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the House passed a version of the bill sponsored by Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., and Rep.

The NFL has moved the Los Angeles Rams' Monday night showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs from Mexico City to Los Angeles due to the poor condition of the field at Azteca Stadium. (AP Photo/Christian Palma) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 The NFL's decision to move the regular-season game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Rams due to the poor condition of the turf at Azteca Stadium has left many Mexicans disappointed, angered and wondering how it will affect the relationship with the league for the future.\n\nAfter consulting with the players association and local officials, the NFL determined the conditions of the historic venue did not meet the standards for playability and moved the game back to the Los Angeles Coliseum. The Rams (9-1) and the Chiefs (9-1) will face off Monday night in a much-anticipated game between the top two teams in each conference.\n\nBased solely on the teams' records, the game was going to be the best matchup ever played outside the United States.\n\nBut Mexico blew it.\n\n\"Colossal shame\" was the headline of the sports newspaper Record. \"The league takes away the best game of the season due to the lousy state of the field that Estadio Azteca was not able to fix. The NFL has left, and its return is in jeopardy.\"\n\nAzteca officials changed the playing surface from natural grass to a hybrid in May, but the turf hasn't been ideal for several months due to its intense use. Since July 21, America and Cruz Azul, the two Liga MX teams that share the stadium, have played 23 games between them in the stadium, and the women's professional team from America has played another seven games there.\n\nThe stadium also hosted two concerts by Colombian singer Shakira on Oct. 11 and 12, and another one from music channel Telehit on Nov. 7 that left the field in its worst condition in years.\n\n\"I feel devastated, angered and ashamed, all of that together,\" said former NFL kicker Raul Allegre, who is Mexican and works as an analyst for ESPN Deportes. \"I'm still trying to figure out how small minds were so irresponsible in the preparations for a game of this magnitude. I know that the world does not revolve around the NFL, but this is a great event not only for the sport but for the country, and it is inconceivable how it was taken so lightly.\"\n\nAccording to an NFL study released last year, the game between the Oakland Raiders and the Houston Texans played in 2016 generated a $45 million impact on the local economy. The Mexican government said that last year*s game between the Raiders and the New England Patriots topped that number.\n\n\"Our fans in Mexico are among the most passionate, dedicated NFL fans anywhere in the world,\" said Mark Waller, the league's executive vice president of International who will be in Mexico City on Thursday to discuss next year and what needs to occur at Azteca to keep the NFL interested in playing there. \"We will continue to look for ways to bring them closer to the NFL in the days and weeks ahead. We share the disappointment of not being able to play this game as planned in Mexico City.\"\n\nThe game is usually scheduled on the third weekend of November, when Mexicans celebrate the Revolution*s anniversary, and the authorities organize additional activities in order to entice fans to spend the whole weekend in the capital. For this year's game, the fanfest that drew more than 300,000 fans in Chapultepec Park was moved to the Zocalo, the country's main square located in downtown Mexico City, in an attempt to draw even more fans. The NFL office in Mexico and the Sports Institute of Mexico City also scheduled a 5k and 10k race for Sunday.\n\nLocal authorities have not said whether both events will continue.\n\n\"We have to learn from this experience so it won't happen again in the future\", said Horacio De la Vega, director of the sports institute in Mexico City. \"Everyone needs to assume their own responsibility in this. I think that the crew that takes care of the field in Azteca should have put more attention in such a big issue as the playing field is, and that did not happen.\"\n\nMany fans are also angered because they already paid airfares and hotel fees that are probably lost.\n\n\"I'm very upset because I already purchased my plane tickets and they canceled the game at the last minute. They promised to reimburse my money for the game ticket, but what about the other expenses, who is going to be held accountable for that?\" said Victor Reynoso, a Rams fan who was planning to come to the capital from the northern city of Monterrey.\n\nReynoso is probably not alone, according to Mexico's Tourism Secretary; around 30,000 fans come to the city for the weekend of the game.\n\nThe federal government, through the Tourism Secretary, pays the NFL $14.5 million for each game. Last year, the NFL and Televisa, which owns Estadio Azteca, announced that they signed an extension to bring back games until the 2021 season.\n\nBut it's uncertain what is going to happen after Televisa failed to present a field up to the standards for an NFL game. Several NFL owners are wary of further games at Azteca because of this situation, and the league is still keen on playing games in Mexico, but might be ready to consider other venues there. Monterrey and Guadalajara have stadiums capable of hosting NFL games, and both cities will be hosting games in the 2026 World Cup, though the NFL has believed Azteca is the best option.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Barry Wilner contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

They will award the Games next June.\n\nIf either of those candidates work out, it will be a victory in that Sweden or Italy will break a string of three straight Winter Games in Asia, two of which \u2014 Sochi (2014) and Beijing (2022) \u2014 have been run by authoritarian governments that didn't have to answer to the public for the money they spent to host.\n\nBut that's not to say Western democracies are falling back in love with the movement. Despite the IOC's attempts to streamline the bidding process and control the costs of the Games, no fewer than eight Western cities and countries have rejected the idea \u2014 either through elections or government action \u2014 of bankrolling what is increasingly viewed as a bloated, expensive sports festival with little upside for the city that takes them on.\n\n\"I think Calgary is another example of a democracy, more specifically, voters in a democracy, deciding that the hosting of the Olympic Games is just not in their best interest \u2014 and they have other things to focus on,\" said Chris Dempsey, who spearheaded Boston's opposition to hosting the 2024 Games.\n\nHere's a look at some of people, places and things in the bidding game, and where they stand after Tuesday's vote:\n\nITALY \u2014 The nation's federal government has vowed not to pay a penny after Turin was removed from this multi-city bid. It means regional governments will foot the brunt of the bill. Rome has bailed on two previous bids for the Summer Games, most recently in 2024, which certainly isn't a comforting thought for the IOC.\n\nSTOCKHOLM \u2014 Only three days after the IOC put the Swedish capital on its short list of finalists, a newly formed government in the city announced it would not provide funding to host the Games. Negotiations are ongoing.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 They have kept venues intact and, in many cases, improved on them, and there is no significant public opposition. To sum it up, the 2002 hosts could probably hold another Olympics in a few months , if pressed. IOC President Thomas Bach would be wise to award them 2030 right now \u2014 that is, only if they don't want 2026.\n\nDENVER \u2014 The only city to be awarded the Olympics, for 1976, only to turn around and reject them, is officially in the running to be the U.S. candidate for 2030. But it's not much of a contest. Not helping matters: Colorado's incoming governor, Jared Polis, recently channeled his inner Richard Lamm \u2014 the then-governor-to-be who led the opposition in the 1970s \u2014 calling the Olympics \"fun things for millionaires and business people\" that leave others paying the bill.\n\nTHOMAS BACH \u2014 The president of the IOC looks more brilliant by the day for his decision to award two Summer Games \u2014 2024 to Paris and 2028 to Los Angeles \u2014 in one shot at last year's IOC meeting. Acknowledging there were \"too many losers\" in the bidding game, he took the only two suitors he had left for the more-expensive, more-grandiose Summer Games and gave them both a victory. He might consider a two-for-one approach on the Winter side, as well.\n\nCASEY WASSERMAN \u2014 Bach might be the president, but it would be difficult to find someone who wields more power in the movement than the head of the LA 2028 organizing committee. He's had a major role in shaping the new U.S. Olympic Committee, signing off on the hiring of the new CEO and CFO. Because he agreed to take the consolation prize, 2028, in what began as a contest for the 2024 Summer Games, he brokered an advantageous marketing deal with the USOC. And his blessing \u2014 and only his blessing \u2014 would be crucial to pushing Salt Lake City into the 2026 slot \u2014 a move that is currently untenable because of how it would impact the LA marketing arrangement.\n\nROTATING CITIES \u2014 The fantastical notion of rotating Olympics between three or four cities \u2014 say Sydney, London and Beijing on the Summer side, and Salt Lake City, Sochi and Vancouver on the Winter side \u2014 suddenly doesn't seem so outlandish. Given the current trend, there's no guaranteeing any city will want to host this behemoth past 2030. Dempsey, the Olympic skeptic, concedes the Olympics provide plenty of magic and power, \"but that magic and power would be just as strong if there were one Winter and one Summer location for the Olympics, or some other process that allows you to host the Games without making exorbitant promises that lead to exorbitant costs.\"\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Helton realizes fans are unhappy just one season after he led the Trojans to the Pac-12 title. (AP Photo/Timothy J. Gonzalez, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Clay Helton believes his job at Southern California is secure as he heads into two games that could determine whether he's right.\n\nThe coach addressed the pertinent topic of his future with the Trojans in a meeting this week, and he did it again when asked about it Tuesday night after practice. While he recognizes the fan unrest created by USC's 5-5 season, Helton told his players to focus on their upcoming rivalry games against UCLA and Notre Dame, not on whether he is about to make a sudden departure.\n\n\"I feel very secure in where I'm at,\" Helton said. \"Like I told them, my plan is to be here for another 15 years. I'd like to do it 'til I'm 60, right here. That's my plan. Know this, I'm not going anywhere. I want them to know my jaw is set.\"\n\nHelton is one season removed from leading USC to the Pac-12 title, and two seasons removed from winning the Rose Bowl in his first full year in charge of a program that he has twice rescued from turmoil. He is 32-15 as the Trojans' head coach, and his contract runs through 2023.\n\nBut the Trojans (5-5, 4-4 Pac-12) are out of the Pac-12 South race heading into their 88th crosstown showdown with the rebuilding Bruins (2-8, 2-5). After three defeats in their last four games, including an embarrassing performance by Helton's offense last weekend in a 15-14 loss to California, their bowl prospects are uncertain even with a sixth win.\n\nA sixth regular-season loss would be the most by a USC team since 2000 \u2014 the year before Pete Carroll took over. Helton has been coaching long enough to know there's a price to pay for such a season at a program with USC's expectations, but he doesn't expect it to be his job.\n\n\"I have a lot of support from (athletic director) Lynn Swann,\" Helton said. \"Lynn, every Monday, walks into my office and has given me nothing but, 'Coach, we're in this for the long haul.' We're going to get this done. That's what I've felt from Day One, and what I felt after the Cal game also. I know, in my heart, I'm going to be here. ... The only pressure I feel is to help a bunch of seniors and a bunch of kids go out and get the Victory Bell one more year.\"\n\nSwann gave a hefty contract extension to Helton last winter even though he didn't hire the coach, and he has remained publicly behind Helton.\n\nHelton's players also stood behind Helton after practice. They know the sky-high expectations placed on every USC team by its fans, and they say they're to blame for not reaching them.\n\n\"Coach Helton is worried about the ballgame,\" freshman quarterback J.T. Daniels said. \"He's not worried about what some random dude in his pajamas is saying on Twitter. ... Nobody listens to Twitter. There's no requirement to have a Twitter account. Anybody can tweet what they want at any time. It's on us as players to realize just because a lot of people are saying it, doesn't make it true.\"\n\nHelton said he addressed his job status with his team because he knows social media chatter can get in the players' heads. Helton has never been a popular hire with a vocal online segment of the USC fan base despite his stabilizing influence on the program and two seasons of immediate success with Sam Darnold as his starting quarterback.\n\nA big finish to the regular season would relieve much of the pressure, and the Trojans would love to give it to Helton.\n\n\"I don't think there is a situation,\" receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said. \"I feel like Coach Helton has become a better head coach this season. It may not seem like it to people outside, but I feel like he's taken steps. He's doing the right thing. It may not be the prettiest ... (but) he's coaching us hard, and I couldn't be more proud of the changes he's made. People see it as he's ruining the team, but he's actually making it better. It's just we're in construction years right now.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: www.apnews.com/CollegeFootball and www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Indians traded versatile infielder Erik Gonzalez to the Pittsburgh Pirates in a five-player swap. (AP Photo/David Dermer, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The Indians traded one of their extra pieces. They're keeping their bigger ones \u2014 for now.\n\nCleveland began what could be a busy offseason on Wednesday by dealing versatile infielder Erik Gonzalez to the Pittsburgh Pirates as part of a five-player swap.\n\nThe AL Central champions sent the 27-year-old Gonzalez, who appeared in 81 games for the Indians last season, along with minor league right-handers Tahnaj Thomas and Dante Mendoza to the Pirates for outfielder Jordan Luplow and infielder Max Moroff.\n\nGonzalez batted .265 with one homer and 16 RBIs last season for Cleveland, which signed the Dominican native in 2009. And while he filled a valuable utility role, he was not going to crack the starting lineup behind All-Stars Francisco Lindor and Jose Ramirez.\n\n\"That was a tough thing for us,\" Indians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said. \"We've had multiple conversations with Erik about it. He's done so many things to impact the organization in his time with us, from the time he signed. He's played every position on the field I think other than catcher at one point or another. But, as our roster has taken shape over the course of the past few seasons, we have not had an opportunity for him to play regularly.\n\n\"So, we feel this will give Erik an opportunity to play more with Pittsburgh and continue his career and potentially blossom into the everyday player we think he can be.\"\n\nThe negligible move gives the Indians needed depth in the outfield, and it could be the first of many deals this winter.\n\nCleveland has not dismissed speculation it may be willing to trade prominent players, including ace Corey Kluber and right-hander Carlos Carrasco. Antonetti said it's difficult to measure whether the team has seen an increase in teams wanting to do business with the Indians.\n\n\"I think what I would reiterate is that I think the conversations have reaffirmed for us that we have a lot of players on our roster and throughout our organization that are of interest to other teams,\" he said. \"And I think what that allows us to do is have a lot of dialogue with other teams about potential opportunities for us to move forward as an organization and get better.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old Luplow is one of those opportunities. Cleveland's outfield was decimated by injuries last season, and the team is not expected to re-sign Michael Brantley as a free agent.\n\nLuplow appeared in 64 games over the past two seasons with the Pirates, who named him their top minor league player in 2017.\n\n\"He's capable of playing all three outfield spots,\" Antonetti said. \"He's spent most of the time in left and right, but we also believe he has the ability to play center field. He complements our roster really well as a right-handed-hitting outfielder that we think is capable of helping us at the major league level.\"\n\nMoroff has split the last three seasons between Triple-A Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, appearing in 26 games for the Pirates in 2018.\n\nAntonetti dealing young players \u2014 especially pitchers \u2014 like Thomas and Mendoza is difficult, but sometimes necessary.\n\n\"Two young pitchers out in Arizona that we like, that have some upside,\" he said. \"Obviously, they're a little ways away from the major Leagues, being both 19 years old. So, guys that definitely have some potential to continue to grow and develop and develop into major league pitchers. But, for us to acquire Max and Jordan, we thought it was a worthwhile deal for us to make, because they're two guys that can help our Major League team here in the near future.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It sells for $19.82, and Walmart's website currently lists the product as \"out of stock.\"\n\nThough the board features the traditional \"Go To Jail\" space, there is a major difference in this version of the classic game: Instead of collecting money, players will be collecting experiences as they traverse the board. These experiences include \"Parents' Basement,\" \"Thrift Shop\" and \"Farmers' Market.\"\n\n\"Money doesn't always buy a great time, but experiences, whether they're good -- or weird -- last forever,\" says the game's description on Walmart's website. The description also notes that \"adulting is hard.\"\n\nIn reaction to Hasbro's newest product, many people took to Twitter to express their feelings towards the game.\n\nSome found the game to be an unfair portrayal of their age demographic.\n\n@Hasbro Can you provide the URL for the Hasbro-official website featuring \"Monopoly for Millennials,\" where you trash on my age demographic because baby boomers caused an economic catastrophe that rendered us financially impotent for a decade?

(Photo: Tim Loehrke, USA TODAY)\n\nThe head of the Food and Drug Administration says the agency is increasing its focus on drug quality to guard against impurities such as the potentially cancer-causing chemicals that have been found in three commonly prescribed blood pressure medications.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb spoke to USA TODAY on Wednesday after the recall of versions of valsartan, irbesartan and losartan.\n\nGottlieb said the agency has hired dozens of chemists to review pharmaceutical companies and monitor for any changes in manufacturing techniques. The increased scrutiny is intended to prevent drug impurities that may be harmful to consumers.\n\n\"We put out very big guidance on this \u2013 it's a known risk,\" Gottlieb said during a meeting with the USA TODAY editorial board on Wednesday. \"It's a place where there's been a significant increase in focus in recent years.\"\n\nThe FDA is still investigating the scope of the manufacturing problem that led to the recalls.\n\nSandoz Inc. recalled losartan potassium hydrochlorothiazide tablets this month because the pills could contain the probable carcinogen N-nitrosodiethylamine, or NDEA. That followed the recalls of valsartan and irbesartan.\n\nPatients who are currently taking versions of the recalled drugs are urged to talk with their pharmacist or doctor. Discontinuing use of a blood pressure drug could cause greater harm to a patient than the small increased risk of cancer.\n\nThe losartan potassium hydrochlorothiazide medication affected by the recall are 100 milligram/25 milligram tablets with the lot number JB8912. The contaminated medication was shipped after Oct. 8. It was made by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. in Linhai, China.\n\nA Sandoz representative said the drug company detected the impurity in its losartan drug ingredient during routine testing. Sandoz is the generic division of Swiss drug maker Novartis.\n\n\"We are exploring all possible options jointly with health authorities to facilitate a continuous supply of losartan to cover patient needs,\" spokeswoman Sofina Mirza-Reid said.\n\nThe wide-ranging investigation of the class of blood pressure medications called angiotensin II receptor blockers began June 19, officials said. That's when Prinston Pharmaceuticals notified the FDA about impurities found in its blood-pressure medication, valsartan, made by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer in Linhai, China.\n\nThe initial recall involved three drug companies that sold five versions of valsartan supplied by Zhejiang.\n\nSeveral batches of the recalled valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide were contaminated with the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA.\n\nZhejiang stopped sending the contaminated valsartan to the United States, the FDA said.\n\nFDA officials said the agency is still investigating whether Zhejiang or other manufacturers made contaminated versions of angiotensin II receptor blockers.\n\nThe FDA suspects that the impurities stemmed from changes in Zhejiang's manufacturing process.\n\nBut the agency has not yet verified the root cause of how the contaminants formed, and why they were not separated from the drug during the manufacturing process.\n\nThe FDA has tested samples of valsartan and other drugs at its laboratory in St. Louis, officials said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/14/fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-drug-recalls-iosartan-valsartan-irbesartan/2000575002/", "CORVALLIS, Ore.

He\u2019s such a known threat that contingency plans have already been put into place to contain him should something go wrong. While all the Avengers are extremely powerful, and, in turn could use their power to become a threat, it\u2019s the Hulk\u2019s inability to control his rage or even be aware of the consequences of his actions that make him so dangerous.\n\nPolygon makes a solid case for Iron Man being the most dangerous Avenger, but Tony\u2019s power isn\u2019t left unchecked. That\u2019s the whole reason we had an entire movie about a brawl in a Wal-Mart parking lot. When Tony gets out of line, people can and have stepped in. The Hulk though, with his unmatched strength and mindless rage, can be beyond reason, making him more dangerous.\n\nWilliams is no stranger to controversy, but this question may be harder to resolve than then the discussion about the GQ cover, which according to the GQ\u2019s research manager, is because the word was handwritten by Virgil Abloh of Off-White, who styles everything in quotation marks.\n\nAnyway, let the debate over the most dangerous Avenger rage.\n\n", "Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri, left, fights for the ball with Qatar's Hassan Khalid Al Haidos during an international friendly soccer match between Switzerland and Qatar at the Cornaredo stadium in Lugano, Switzerland, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018.

This for a reason,\" Sanchez said.\n\nSwitzerland, which reached the last 16 in this year's World Cup in Russia and had kept nine clean sheets in its past 10 home matches, had wasted a number of chances to put the game away earlier and hit the post twice.\n\n\"It's a really awful defeat, it's a match almost to forget. We played really badly,\" Switzerland midfielder Remo Freuler said. \"We have to analyze what we did badly and I don't think we did anything well. ... I don't think we undervalued them but we never got into the match today.\"\n\nThe Swiss came into the game as massive favorites after putting six goals past Panama and Iceland this year, as well as scoring five against Hungary in 2017.\n\nThe last time Qatar played a European team it lost 2-1 at home against minnow Liechtenstein last December. Its last win against a European team was a 1-0 victory against Andorra last August.

Joe Flacco's hip injury means extra practice time for Ravens backup quarterbacks Lamar Jackson and Robert Griffin III, and perhaps one of them will make their first start of the season. (AP Photo/Gail Burton, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) \u2014 Lamar Jackson isn't staying awake at night thinking about the prospect of making his first NFL start.\n\nBaltimore Ravens starting quarterback Joe Flacco missed practice Wednesday because of a hip injury, and his status for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals is uncertain.\n\nIf Flacco can't go, coach John Harbaugh likely will turn to Jackson, whose first pro season thus far has been spent taking a few snaps per game in run situations.\n\n\"I'm going into it just like any other week. Just preparing for whatever,\" Jackson said. \"Everything is still the same.\"\n\nStarting at quarterback for a team desperate to end a three-game skid might cause some rookies to squirm, but Jackson insisted he's sleeping \"like a baby.\"\n\nFlacco hurt his hip early in a 23-16 loss to Pittsburgh on Nov. 4. He had the bye week to recover, but is still receiving treatment, meaning his availability for Baltimore (4-5) against the Bengals (5-4) could come down to a game-time decision.\n\nHarbaugh appears done talking about it.\n\n\"Rather than tip my toe in the water and start answering one question and then not answering the next one, I'm just not going to get into it. I'm just going to leave it alone,\" he said. \"I feel like we don't owe anybody any answers.\"\n\nIf Flacco can't play, veteran Robert Griffin III will likely serve as backup to the rookie he's been mentoring since summer. Griffin, like Jackson, was a running quarterback who had to make the transition into a passing league.\n\nGriffin won the Heisman Trophy as a junior at Baylor and finished with 2,254 yards rushing with 33 touchdowns. Jackson won the Heisman in 2016 and finished with 4,132 yards on the ground with 50 touchdowns.\n\nNow they're together in Baltimore, trying to get the Ravens into the postseason.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be a part of a winner,\" Griffin said. \"This franchise has done a lot of winning; we just got to make sure that we get back to that.\"\n\nAfter sitting out last season, Griffin launched his comeback by signing in April with the Ravens, presumably to be Flacco's backup. He dropped to No. 3 on the depth chart soon after Baltimore traded up to get Jackson in the first round.\n\nThough he has 41 career starts (including playoffs), Griffin will likely serve as a backup Sunday if Flacco can't play. At least he will be in uniform after spending the first nine weeks on the inactive list.\n\n\"I haven't been OK not playing,\" Griffin said. \"I think if I was OK not playing, then I wouldn't be the competitor that I've grown to be. But within that, you have to control what you can.\"\n\nHe will do what he's asked on Sunday, but makes no secret of his desire to start.\n\n\"It would be awesome,\" Griffin said. \"It's been a heck of a journey, but coming here was the best thing I could've done. Knowing what it means to play like a Raven and growing with these guys has been something that's been real special for me.

(Photo: David Maialetti, The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP)\n\nThere was a loud bang, and suddenly the Southwest Airlines jet rolled 41 degrees to the left. Smoke began to fill the cabin, and flight attendants rushed row by row to make sure all passengers could get oxygen from their masks.\n\nWhen flight attendant Rachel Fernheimer got to row 14, she saw a woman still restrained by her lap belt but with her head, torso and arm hanging out a window.\n\nFernheimer grabbed one of the woman's legs while flight attendant Seanique Mallory grabbed her lower body. They described being unable to bring the woman back in the plane until two male passengers stepped in to help.\n\nThe harrowing details from the fatal April flight were released for the first time as the National Transportation Safety Board began a hearing Wednesday into the engine failure on Southwest Flight 1380, which carried 144 passengers and five crew members.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to reach the pilots by intercom because of the rush of air and noise, Mallory was finally able to relay the situation to Tammie Jo Shults and Darren Ellisor, who had already planned an emergency landing of the crippled Boeing 737-700 in Philadelphia.\n\n\"We got (unintelligible words) a window open and somebody - is out the window,\" Mallory said. According to a transcript, she adds a little later, \"Yeah everyone still in their seats, we have people have been helpin' her get in I don't know what her condition is, but the window is completely out.\"\n\nThe flight attendants told investigators at least one of the male passengers put his arm out of the window and wrapped it around the woman's shoulder to help pull her back in. Fernheimer said when she looked out the window, she could see that one of the plane's engines was shattered, and there was blood on the outside of the aircraft.\n\nThe passenger in the window seat, Jennifer Riordan, was fatally injured \u2014 the first death on a U.S. airline flight since 2009. Eight other passengers including at least one of the men who helped pull Riordan back in the window, suffered minor injuries.\n\nOne of the men, an EMT in Texas, and a retired school nurse began CPR on Riordan, but according to interviews with investigators, they said her injuries seemed too severe. Emergency personnel took over once the plane landed, and passengers gathered her belongings to send with them.\n\nThe accident was triggered by an engine fan blade that broke off. A piece of engine cover struck and shattered the window next to Riordan, a 43-year-old mother of two from Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nWednesday's hearing in Washington focused on design and inspection of fan blades on the engine, made by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran S.A.\n\nA spokeswoman for CFM said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the company could not comment on an active investigation, but noted that it had \"responded aggressively\" to complete blade inspections after the fatal flight before an Aug. 31 deadline.\n\nThe blade that broke had made about 32,000 flights. An examination indicated that it probably was beginning to suffer cracks from metal fatigue when it was last inspected in 2012, said Mark Habedank, an engineering official at CFM. But the crack was smaller than could be detected by the test used at the time, which used fluorescent dye.\n\nAfter the fatal accident, CFM recommended the use of more sophisticated tests using ultrasound or electrical currents. The company also recommended much more frequent inspections and lubrication of the blades.\n\nA broken fan blade had triggered a similar engine failure with shrapnel on another Southwest flight, in August 2016 over Florida.\n\nAn FAA expert on engines, Christopher Spinney, said the agency considered the Florida incident \"very unexpected.\"\n\n\"We determined early that we would require some corrective action in that it was an unsafe condition,\" Spinney said, \"but we also determined we had some time.\"\n\nRather than issue an emergency order for fan blade inspections after the 2016 incident, the FAA began a normal process for new regulations, which includes a chance for the public to comment and takes longer. That process was still underway when the fatal accident occurred.\n\nFan blades have been thought to have no real lifetime limit. CFM and FAA officials said they were now considering whether blades must be replaced at some point even if they don't show wear.\n\nRepresentatives from CFM, Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration were also expected to be questioned about design of the engine housing, which is supposed to prevent pieces from breaking loose.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/14/hearing-reveals-chilling-details-fatal-southwest-flight/2002783002/", "", "Ted Olson led Republicans to victory in Bush v. Gore, now he's helping CNN go after Trump\n\nCLOSE The Radio Television Digital News Association is demanding the White House restore media credentials to CNN correspondent Jim Acosta after suspending his pass following a heated confrontation with President Donald Trump at a news conference. (Nov. 8) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Attorney Theodore B. Olson, the legal heavyweight best known for taking the Republicans' winning case before the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, is one of the attorneys representing CNN in its lawsuit against the Trump administration over the revocation of correspondent Jim Acosta's White House press credentials.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has held in no uncertain terms that the First Amendment protects 'robust political debate,' including speech that it is critical of those who hold public office,\" Olson said in a statement on Tuesday. \"Mr. Acosta\u2019s press credentials must be restored so that all members of the press know they will remain free to ask tough questions, challenge government officials, and report the business of the nation to the American people.\"\n\nAcosta's credentials were taken after a wild press conference last week in which President Donald Trump called the reporter a \"rude, terrible person\" as Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone. It was the latest in a number of tense exchanges between Acosta and the president.\n\nCNN announced Tuesday that it filed a lawsuit against Trump and other administration officials to get Acosta's credentials restored. USA TODAY and its parent company Gannett joined other news media organizations Wednesday in a filing friend-of-the-court briefs on CNN's behalf in the case.\n\nIn addition to his work on behalf of President George W. Bush in the Florida recount for the 2000 presidential election, Olson is also known for helping draft the legal arguments that led to the overturning of Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriage. Olson teamed up with attorney David Boies \u2013 the man who represented Vice President Al Gore's in 2000 \u2013 for that 2014 case.\n\nFormer Solicitor General Ted Olson testifies on a panel of experts and character witnesses before the Senate Judiciary Committee on behalf of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Sept. 7, 2018, in Washington.

FEC, in the which the court ruled that political contributions are a form of free speech and protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIn March, Olson, 77, turned down an offer to join President Donald Trump's legal team to help defend the president in the face of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election meddling, according to a report from The Washington Post.\n\nLast month, Olson resigned as a member of the American Bar Association after the organization called for the FBI to investigate the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the National Law Journal reported.

From The Athletic:\n\n\u201cWith what was said, there is already no way Durant is coming back,\u201d one player said. \u201cThe only hope is that they can say this summer, \u2018See, KD. We\u2019ve got your back. We protected you from Draymond.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo as we did with LeBron James in the middle of his final season with the Cavaliers, we\u2019re power ranking every landing spot \u2014 regardless of cap space \u2014 the forward could look at next summer.\n\n29. Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nThis is the scenario I most want to have happen but there\u2019s NO WAY he\u2019s going back there. Can you imagine the social media explosion if he went back to play with Russell Westbrook again?\n\n28. Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nIf he wants to win a ring in the near future, he probably wants to steer clear of LeBron James\u2019 old stomping grounds.\n\n27. Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nWould YOU want to go there after all that Jimmy Butler drama? Didn\u2019t think so.\n\n26. Memphis Grizzlies\n\nAdding Durant won\u2019t elevate this roster to a contender, so they\u2019re out.\n\n25. Orlando Magic\n\nNah.\n\n24. Chicago Bulls\n\nThey\u2019re not quite there yet with their rebuild.\n\n23. Charlotte Hornets\n\nNot much beyond Kemba Walker, but the bigger issue is: Does Durant want to be bugged by Michael Jordan all the time to be better? I wouldn\u2019t if I was him.\n\n22. Detroit Pistons\n\nAmong the reasons why he wouldn\u2019t want to go there: Where would he fit with Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond there?\n\n21. Sacramento Kings\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, they\u2019re 8-6 and the eighth seed in the West! That won\u2019t last this season, but the future is suddenly kind of bright in Sacramento. It\u2019s just not enough to entice Durant to come to the California capital.\n\n20. Phoenix Suns\n\nI guess if he wants to take on the challenge of teaching a young team how to win, this would be higher up. It just doesn\u2019t seem like Durant\u2019s M.O. right now. Although, as you\u2019ll see below, he does love Phoenix as a city.\n\n19. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nIf you just spent a few years getting destroyed by critics for going to a super-team and turning them into a mega-super-team, why would you do it again?\n\n18. Portland Trail Blazers\n\nThey should be higher: Durant is a Nike guy, and maybe he\u2019d want to give the Blazers what they should have had in 2007 when they took (wince) Greg Oden ahead of him. But after he ripped this team on C.J. McCollum\u2019s podcast and got into a Twitter fight with the guard, I think that ship has sailed.\n\n17. Washington Wizards\n\nI know: He\u2019s from Washington D.C. But he\u2019s not going home just to play with a team that\u2019s seriously underachieving and that may tear it all down by the trade deadline.\n\n16. Atlanta Hawks\n\nI was going to put him lower but then I saw these photos posted by Trae Young\u2019s dad. IT\u2019S A SIGN.\n\nYep it still doesn\u2019t seem real.

Miami Heat\n\nI\u2019m just sticking them here because Pat Riley is convincing and Miami is where everyone wants to be.\n\n13. San Antonio Spurs\n\nWho doesn\u2019t want to play for Gregg Popovich? The problem is the roster situation doesn\u2019t scream contender even if Durant was there.\n\n12. Boston Celtics\n\nHe\u2019s pals with Kyrie Irving. That\u2019s got to be worth a lot. At the moment, however, Danny Ainge would have to do quite a bit of maneuvering to carve out room for Durant due to a crowded roster. There\u2019s no doubt he\u2019d do it if he realized he had a chance, especially since he said he was close to getting Durant in 2016.\n\n11. Milwaukee Bucks\n\nPutting Greek Freak and Durant together could either be the greatest thing ever or a total disaster. ALL THE WINGSPAN!\n\n10. Indiana Pacers\n\nHe and Victor Oladipo would make a really fun pairing.\n\n9. New Orleans Pelicans\n\nThe Brow and KD. Together. And New Orleans is a really fun city.\n\n8. Toronto Raptors\n\nThis assumes Kawhi Leonard stays. The already-talented Raptors immediately become the East\u2019s best team (if that isn\u2019t the case now). So why aren\u2019t they higher? Durant gets the \u201cRING CHASER\u201d label again.\n\n7. Houston Rockets\n\nThey do have room at power forward \u2026 and wouldn\u2019t it be delicious if he decided to stick it to Green by playing on the Warriors\u2019 biggest rival? Same problem as joining the Raps, though.\n\n6. Denver Nuggets\n\nPotential 2019 free agent Kevin Durant on C.J. McCollum\u2019s @PullUpPod podcast: \"I like Denver a lot, it\u2019s super chill.

There\u2019s so many young pieces in Caris LeVert, D\u2019Angelo Russell, Jarrett Allen and others, and he\u2019d get to be the No. 1 superstar that brings them all together without the pressure of playing at Madison Square Garden.\n\n3. New York Knicks\n\nIf Durant wants to add \u201cwon a championship and saved New York from basketball hell\u201d to his resume, this is the spot.

(Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nATLANTA -- He is the perfect fit, the kid who grew up a New York Yankees fan, idolized one of their most famous players, and wants to be the man to lead them back to the World Series, ending the reign of terror by the Boston Red Sox.\n\nHe is Manny Machado, one of the greatest young players to hit the free agent market.\n\nAnd this time, after all the years of trying to get below the luxury tax, the Yankees have no financial restrictions on signing the guy who could be the centerpiece of their infield for the next 10 years.\n\nThe $300 million question is whether the Yankees have the same interest in Machado as he has in them.\n\nThe Yankees have yet to publicly declare their interest in signing Machado, 26, and say they first want to address the void in their starting rotation. But if they decide they want Machado, they need to talk.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just important,\u2019\u2019 Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner said. \u201cIt\u2019s essential.\u2019\u2019\n\nThey need to have a heart-to-heart chat with Machado about exactly what he meant when he uttered the infamous words that he didn\u2019t want to be \u201cJohnny Hustle,\u2019\u2019 during a Fox postseason interview.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a $300 million guy or a $10 million guy,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said at the Major League Baseball owners\u2019 meetings, \u201cclearly those comments are troubling.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s really [GM Brian Cashman\u2019s] job. If we\u2019re interested in any player, to sit down with them face to face and ask him, 'Where did this come from? What was the context around the entire interview? Was there a point? How do you justify it?'\n\n\u201cBecause that ain\u2019t going to sell where we play baseball.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen asked how important it was to determine whether Machado simply misspoke, or actually meant those words, Steinbrenner didn\u2019t blink.\n\n\u201cThat conversation will happen,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said.\n\nMachado, who also kicked Milwaukee Brewers first baseman Jesus Aguilar\u2019s leg while running to first base during the National League Championship Series, caused a commotion with his comments during a pregame show when asked about hustling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to change,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of player that\u2019s going to be 'Johnny Hustle,' and run down the line and slide to first base \u2026 and you know, whatever can happen. That\u2019s just not my personality. That\u2019s not my cup of tea. That\u2019s not who I am.\u2019\u2019\n\nMachado told his teammates and several friends that he intended to say, \u2018Not False Johnny Hustle,' but realized the words can cause any team to pause before possibly making him the highest-paid player in baseball history.\n\nSteinbrenner says he will talk in the next few weeks with Alex Rodriguez, who has known Machado since he was a 16-year-old growing up in Miami.\n\n\u201cWe (have) just begun this process,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said. \u201cOur pro scouting meetings started two weeks ago.

It\u2019s tough enough for them when they don\u2019t win a World Series, but even more painful when it\u2019s the Red Sox who do.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to win a world championship,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said, \u201cso it\u2019s going to hurt me no matter who it is. Clearly, having our biggest rival doing it, hurts more. Absolutely.\n\n\u201cBut the pain was still significant.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe perfect cure-all for that acid reflux is to find a way to finally topple the Red Sox, who have won four World Series since 2004 and are acting like the Yankees of old, blowing right past the $197 million luxury tax with a $240 million payroll.\n\nThe Yankees already have re-signed veteran starter CC Sabathia and left fielder Brett Gardner this winter, but Steinbrenner knows it\u2019s not near enough to catch the Red Sox. The Yankees still plan to trade starter Sonny Gray, and perhaps a few of their prized prospects, to get at least two front-line pitchers, before they would attempt to bring in Machado.\n\n\u201cWe have to add pieces,\" Steinbrenner said. \"Our starting pitching struggled in October. That much was obvious. We have work to do.\n\n\u201cWe need a team that\u2019s going to win a championship. That\u2019s what our fans expect. It\u2019s never out of our mind. It\u2019s in our DNA.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Yankees won 100 games last season, so it\u2019s hardly as if they need to make household changes. They just need to make the right ones. They not only need to find players with high character to fit into their clubhouse, but players who can handle New York.\n\n\u201cNew York is a tough place to play with the media, and the fans are very demanding. The makeup has to be there. That\u2019s a concern for any free agent,\u2019\u2019 Steinbrenner said.\n\nThe Yankees, Steinbrenner said, already have lopped free agents off their wish list who they believe can\u2019t cut it in New York.\n\nMachado still is on that list. But, they still must have that talk.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @BNightengale", "Florida defensive lineman Jachai Polite (99) does a chest bump with a teammate after stopping a South Carolina drive late in fourth quarter in an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Gainesville, Fla. (AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) \u2014 Alabama set an SEC record with 12 players taken in the 2018 NFL draft, including four in the first round.\n\nThe top-ranked Crimson Tide are sure to have several high draft picks in next year's draft, too, but there are players at many other SEC schools that are also likely to hear their names called in the first round of the 2019 draft.\n\nAccording to several mock draft boards the SEC could have first-rounders from as many as nine schools.\n\nNot surprisingly the top-rated SEC prospect with two weeks left in the regular season is from Alabama. Offensive tackle Jonah Williams is picked by some to be drafted as high as No. 2 after starting all 39 games in his career with the Crimson Tide and earning All-America honors at left tackle last season.\n\n\"He's one of those guys that's a perfectionist\" Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \"He wants to be the best player and he's one of the guys that's willing to do the things that you have to do to be the best player.\"\n\nOther possible first-round picks from Alabama include defensive tackle Quinnen Williams, safety Deionte Thompson, defensive lineman Raekwon Davis, linebacker Mack Wilson and running back Damien Harris.\n\nLSU has two top-20 prospects in cornerback Greedy Williams and linebacker Devin White. Williams led the SEC with six interceptions as a redshirt freshman last season and has two interceptions and 28 tackles and has defended eight passes this year. White ranked first in the country with 96 assisted tackles last season and has 89 tackles, including seven for losses, a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries this year.\n\nKentucky hasn't had a player taken in the past two drafts with the Wildcats' most recent draft pick coming when Josh Forrest was selected by the Rams in the sixth round in 2016. Their drought should end this year with outside linebacker Josh Allen expected to be chosen in the first round. If he is, it will give the Wildcats a first-round pick for the first time since Bud Dupree was selected by the Steelers with the 22nd overall pick in the 2015 draft.\n\nKentucky coach Mark Stoops isn't shy about bragging about his star player and called him the: \"best defensive player in the country,\" on his radio show last month.\n\nAllen, who is a senior, leads the SEC in tackles for losses (16) and sacks (11) and his five forced fumbles lead the nation. The 6-foot-5, 260-pound Allen has 65 tackles and has recovered two fumbles.\n\nMississippi could have two first-round picks with offensive lineman Greg Little and wide receiver A.J. Brown both projected to be top-25 selections. The Rebels entered the season with three first-round prospects, but receiver D.K. Metcalf could choose to return for another season after suffering a season-ending neck injury which required surgery last month.\n\nBrown's 72 receptions and 1,047 yards receiving both lead the SEC and he's had five 100-yard receiving games this season, including three in a row. The 6-1, 225 pound Brown became the school's all-time leading receiver in a loss to Texas A&M on Saturday. He has 2,711 yards receiving to move in front of Shay Hodge, who had 2,646 yards receiving from 2006-09.\n\n\"Been around a lot of great receivers here at Ole Miss, for him to be the all-time leading receiver, that's a pretty special accomplishment for him,\" Mississippi coach Matt Luke said. \"He's been very unselfish, playing inside, playing outside. He's very versatile. That will do nothing but help him going forward, his ability to do a bunch of different things.\"\n\nGeorgia, which had three first-round picks selected in the 2018 draft, could have another one next year in cornerback Deandre Baker. He flirted with the draft last offseason before returning for his senior year and has two interceptions and leads the SEC with nine passes defended.\n\nMississippi State has two defensive linemen who are among the best in the nation and could both be first-round draft picks. Jeffery Simmons, a 6-4, 300-pound tackle, is a three-year starter whose 12\u00bd tackles for losses rank fourth in the SEC. Simmons has 27\u00bd tackles for losses and five sacks and has piled up 148 tackles in his career.\n\nMontez Sweat is a defensive end who led the SEC with 16 tackles for losses and 11 sacks last season. This year he also ranks high on the SEC charts and is fourth with 13 tackles for losses and second with 10 sacks.\n\nAt Missouri, two offensive stars could be selected in the first round in 2019. Tight end Albert Okwuegbunam led the SEC with 11 touchdown receptions last season and is fourth this year with six TD grabs and has 466 yards receiving. His quarterback Drew Lock could join him as a first-round pick after a four-year career where he's thrown for 11,342 yards and 92 touchdowns with just 39 interceptions.\n\nLock led the nation with 44 touchdown passes last season and ranks second in the SEC this year with 21 TD tosses. He has thrown for 2,647 yards which also ranks second.\n\nFlorida has a top-10 draft prospect in defensive lineman Jachai Polite. The junior is third in the country with four forced fumbles and his 12\u00bd tackles for losses and 7\u00bd sacks are both No. 4 in the SEC.\n\nDefensive tackle Derrick Brown could be the first player from Auburn taken in the first round since the Tigers had two first-rounders in 2014. Brown has 9\u00bd tackles for losses and 3\u00bd sacks this season and has 20 tackles for losses and 8 sacks in three years at Auburn.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Knights' streak is 22 and pushing toward rare air in college football. There have been 26 streaks of 25 straight victories in major college football history.\n\nWhile UCF fans probably are not going to get the recognition and ranking they believe they deserve from the College Football Playoff selection committee, the Knights are lined up for another marquee bowl bid and a shot to take down a highly ranked Power Five team \u2014 like they did last season against Auburn in the Peach Bowl.\n\nSlip up against Cincinnati and the American Athletic Conference East Division becomes muddled, as well as the race for the coveted spot in the New Year's Six bowls that goes to the highest ranked conference champion from outside the Power Five leagues.\n\nThe latest CFP rankings had Utah State 23rd, Cincinnati 24th and Boise State 25th. The Aggies and Broncos play next week in a game likely to decide the Mountain West's Mountain Division. If the Mountain West and American teams pick each other off, keep tabs on Buffalo of the Mid-American Conference and UAB of Conference USA, both checking in at 9-1.

Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY", "", "", "", "", "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that legislation overhauling how Congress deals with sexual harassment within its ranks will be passed before the new session starts.\n\nSpeaking at the Senate Republican leadership press conference, McConnell said he\u2019s talked about the bill \u201cat length\u201d with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who has taken the lead on the Senate version of the bill along with Sen. Roy Blunt, D-Mo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on getting that done before the end of the year,\" McConnell told reporters Wednesday.\n\nAs the #MeToo Movement continues to reverberate, Congress has yet to pass reform within its own chambers. Over the past year, several lawmakers have resigned due to allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nBoth the Senate and House have passed separate bills reforming the process of how sexual harassment is reported internally, but the differences between the two proposals have not yet been reconciled.\n\nBoth versions of the bill seek to make members of Congress personally liable if they're found guilty of sexual harassment or misconduct toward a staffer or another congressional employee. This provision was introduced after a report that over $342,000 in taxpayer funds was used to settle discrimination and harassment complaints involving members of the House from 2008 to 2012.\n\nThe House bill, passed in February, calls for each congressional office to adopt an anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policy.\n\n\u201cThere is no place for sexual harassment or any type of harassment, period,\" Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., chairman of the House Administration Committee, said before the House vote on the measure.\n\nThe Senate bill, passed in May, also would update rules around reporting sexual harassment, including one that forced victims to wait out a 30-day \"cooling off\" period before taking complaints to court.\n\n\"I think it puts the responsibility where the American people think it should be,\" Blunt said during the Senate vote on the bill.\n\nIn March, all 22 female senators wrote an open letter McConnell expressing disappointment that Congress has \"failed to enact meaningful reforms\" in regard to sexual harassment. USA TODAY previously reported that McConnell disagreed with the provision in the House bill that makes members financially liable for discrimination settlements.\n\nBut a spokesman countered that report, telling USA TODAY that McConnell \"supports members being personally, financially liable for sexual misconduct in which they have engaged.\"\n\nIf passed, the new rules regarding sexual harassment would be the first update to the 1995 Congressional Accountability Act, which applied workplace rules to Congress for the first time.\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins, Nicole Gaudiano and Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/14/mitch-mcconnell-vows-congressional-action-sexual-harassment-reform/2001294002/", "Cincinnati Bengals special assistant Hue Jackson, left, meets with running back Giovani Bernard (25) during NFL football practice at Paul Brown Stadium, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, in Cincinnati. Jackson was fired by the Cleveland Browns last month after he won only three games in three seasons as head coach. (AP Photo/John Minchillo) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 Hue Jackson was talking to reporters outside Paul Brown Stadium when quarterback Andy Dalton yelled at him that practice was about to begin.\n\nJust like old times.\n\nThe former Bengals offensive coordinator is back in town, though this time dabbling in the other side of the playbook \u2014 well, mostly. How that part plays out is an interesting subplot as the Bengals (5-4) make one final push to save their at-risk season.\n\nAn unusual coaching arrangement for desperate times.\n\n\"It's a unique situation for a lot of us,\" linebacker Preston Brown said.\n\nA 51-14 loss to the Saints \u2014 the third straight game in which Cincinnati has given up 500 yards \u2014 set things in motion. Head coach Marvin Lewis fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday and installed himself in the dual role of coach and coordinator.\n\nHe also called his unemployed close friend to see if he was interested in returning for a third stint in Cincinnati as a special assistant on defense. Jackson was fired by the Browns two weeks earlier after winning three games in three seasons.\n\nJackson was hoping the Bengals would reach out to him.\n\n\"This is a tremendous opportunity for me, and I'm just thankful that they said, 'You come on home,'\" Jackson said.\n\nSo, now what?\n\nLewis built his coaching reputation as a defensive coordinator, directing the Ravens defense that won the Super Bowl in the 2000 season. He's decided to go back to his roots as a coordinator while also functioning as head coach \u2014 a challenge that few would undertake.\n\n\"There's a lot,\" Lewis said Wednesday.\n\nHe spent Tuesday night at home scripting defensive plays. He then led the team meeting on Wednesday morning and presided over the defensive meeting, simplifying things and pulling out a few plays from his past.\n\n\"He had a different PowerPoint,\" Brown said. \"He had a really small font, so it was kind of hard to take notes. But it was cool having him up there. You can tell he was having fun.\n\n\"We did a lot of things \u2014 old plays he was calling in 2015, '14, stuff I haven't seen yet. So he was bringing back some plays.\"\n\nLewis isn't sure how it will play out Sunday in Baltimore (4-5), a game the Bengals need to win to stay in the AFC North race. Jackson is providing input for the defensive game plan and will be on the sideline helping Lewis manage the defense, though their game-day roles haven't been defined.\n\nOne thing is clear: Jackson won't be dabbling in the offense. Not for now, anyway.\n\nAsked if Jackson would do anything with the offense, Lewis said emphatically, \"No. Separate from the offense.\"\n\nJackson was the Bengals' offensive coordinator when Dalton had his best season in 2015. He left to take Cleveland's head coaching job after the season. His return could create an awkward dynamic on the coaching staff.\n\nJackson said that offensive coordinator Bill Lazor came to his office at Paul Brown Stadium to greet him. Jackson said he'd be glad to offer an opinion if Lazor asks, but he's going to be careful not to trespass on other coaches' areas.\n\nHe knows that adding a newcomer midseason can work both ways.\n\n\"It can be impactful, but it can also hurt, too,\" Jackson said. \"And I get that. I just have to play my role, to the best of my ability. I don't want to do anything to upset anything that they have going on here. But at the same time if I can help, I do want to help.\"\n\nA DOZEN INJURED\n\nSeven players were held out of practice because of injuries Wednesday and five more were limited. The defense has been hit particularly hard.\n\nLB Preston Brown (knee), CB Dre Kirkpatrick (concussion), LB Nick Vigil (knee) and DT Adolphus Washington (knee) didn't practice. LB Vontaze Burfict (hip), CB Darqueze Dennard (shoulder) and LB Vincent Rey (groin) were limited.\n\nWR A.J. Green is out indefinitely with an injured toe. WR John Ross was limited because of a groin injury.\n\nSTADIUM UPDATE\n\nThe Bengals and Hamilton Country agreed in principle Wednesday on a plan to add parking and a music venue outside Paul Brown Stadium, and to repair and upgrade the 19-year-old stadium. The Bengals retain the right to build a cover over one of their adjacent practice fields, though they would have to pay for it. The team said there are no immediate plans to cover a field. The Bengals use the University of Cincinnati's covered field on wintry days.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nThrough 10 weeks of the NFL season we now have a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of NFL teams and their defensive identities.\n\nWhile NFL head coaches game plan how to exploit these weaknesses, savvy fantasy owners do the same thing to gain an edge in daily fantasy tournaments.\n\nThere are four teams allowing 23-plus fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks through 10 weeks of the season and the gap from the fourth to the fifth place team is nearly as large as the gap from the fifth place to the 20th place team. New Orleans, Tampa Bay, Cincinnati and Atlanta have all emerged as defensive units that allow consistent production to opposing quarterbacks. The Saints are a particularly unique case as they have been a top 5 rush defense and funnel opponents toward the pass. The Eagles travel to New Orleans this week to play in the SuperDome, often referred to as \"The Coors Field of DFS\" due to the high-scoring matchups, just like what fantasy baseball players see from Colorado.\n\nCarson Wentz projects as a top QB option in a matchup where the Eagles have a 24-point team total and a need to throw if they're trailing. DailyRoto has Wentz projected for the highest passing yardage of any QB on the Week 11 main slates, expected to throw for 300-plus yards and two touchdowns with upside for more. The Saints defense has also allowed the most PPR points to opposing pass catchers and both Alshon Jeffrey and Zach Ertz can be paired comfortably with Wentz in tournaments. The duo has combined for 56 targets over the previous three weeks and should be in line for another strong workload. While it remains to be seen how quickly Golden Tate can pick up the Eagles offense, his emergence would hurt Nelson Agholor more than Jeffrey or Ertz.\n\nThe Raiders, Patriots, Bucs and Panthers all average double digit points allowed to opposing tight ends. With DFS pricing tighter, the highly variant tight end position has been a popular position to save salary. At just $2,900 on DraftKings, Arizona's Ricky Seals-Jones should provide value and salary relief for fantasy lineups. Since Byron Leftwich took over playcalling, Seals-Jones has drawn 13 targets in the last two games and finished with double digit fantasy points in Week 10. Betting on Seals-Jones is also a bet against the depth of the tight-end position as a whole, allowing daily players to spend up on high volume wideouts and running backs.\n\nAmong running backs, Ezekiel Elliott of Dallas also has value for tournaments against an Atlanta Falcons team that ranks as a bottom five defense against opposing RBs. Zeke is one of the true workhorse backs, seeing 90 percent of the Cowboys snaps at running back, virtually all of their RB carries and he also projecting for an 18 percent share of targets in Week 11. With high ownership going to Saquon Barkley, Melvin Gordon and Alvin Kamara, using Elliott could be a contrarian play that pays dividends.\n\n___\n\nFor more daily fantasy tools and advice, visit DailyRoto: https://dailyroto.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

So, under the most unusual of circumstances, \"Monday Night Football\" returns to Los Angeles for the first time in 33 years.\n\n\"We are disappointed that we are not going to be in Mexico City,\" Jay Rothman, the \"Monday Night Football\" producer, said Wednesday. \"We were really excited about the game when the schedule came out, we had it two years ago, we wanted it last year with New England and didn't get it, and this year we got it back.\n\n\"We understand the circumstance and just had to adjust. As difficult as the logistics are for both teams ... the same holds true for our crew.

He goes into Sunday's winner-take-all season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway convinced he's finally going to win his first Cup title.\n\nLogano will race Truex, Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch for the championship.\n\n\"I said 15 weeks ago we were an underdog and I would be surprised if we made it to the final four,\" Logano said. \"Now I feel like we are the favorites to win this thing. It's crazy how things change.\"\n\nHe feels as if he's the favorite, but Logano is clearly the underdog of this group. His No. 22 Team Penske group was mediocre most of the season and an afterthought to the so-called Big Three of Busch, Harvick and Truex, a trio of former series champions who dominated the regular season.\n\nBut Logano mastered a path through the playoffs and could pull off the upset of his career.\n\nIt would be vindication for the driver tagged as NASCAR's next superstar by Hall of Famer Mark Martin when Logano was just a teen waiting to turn 18 and be eligible to race at NASCAR's national level. He was nicknamed \"Sliced Bread,\" because he was allegedly \"the best thing since,\" and the expectations were enormous by the time he made his debut.\n\nLogano is by nature happy-go-lucky, and when he made it to the big leagues, his parents traveled the circuit with him. That became a bone of contention among Logano's peers, who resented his clean path into NASCAR and found him an easy target for scuffles on and off the track.\n\nThen he was pushed into the Cup Series way ahead of schedule because Joe Gibbs Racing, the team that groomed him, had an unexpected opening. It made Logano a target for everyone from Tony Stewart, Kevin Harvick, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth and other high-profile drivers.\n\nDrama after drama would have broken some, but Logano has rebounded every time.\n\nWhen Gibbs could no longer wait for him to produce, he landed with Team Penske and has won 18 races since moving teams. He's qualified for NASCAR's championship round in three of the last five seasons, and was the favorite to win the title in 2015 but a feud with Matt Kenseth led to Kenseth wrecking Logano out of an automatic berth into the finale.\n\nHe was in a spectacular crash racing Carl Edwards for the victory the next year, and a penalty kept the No. 22 team out of the playoffs last season. Logano was the first driver locked into the finale this year, despite just one regular-season victory and not showing his Ford could keep up with the Big Three.\n\nHe earned his berth win a victory at Martinsville Speedway, where he moved Truex out of his way in the final turn to grab the ticket to Homestead. Truex was furious with the move, but Logano was adamant he had to take that opportunity and couldn't risk not going for broke.\n\nLogano was booed as he took the checkered flag.\n\n\"I love his passion. The one thing you've got to appreciate out of Joey is that he races, he gives 100 percent,\" said Logano crew chief Todd Gordon. \"He's racing all the time, and that's a great attribute of his. He's up on it. You never have to question where we are, if it's through practice or through any session, you're getting 100 percent out of him.\"\n\nLogano backed up his right to be aggressive with Truex and Almirola in last weekend's penultimate playoff race at Phoenix. A flat tire caused him to crash out early. If Logano hadn't won Martinsville, the Phoenix crash would have prevented him from making the finale. So he paid no mind to Truex's anger, and even less to Almirola's assentation that Logano should have cut other playoff drivers some slack because Logano had nothing on the line once he was locked into Homestead.\n\n\"Our sport was built on tough racing and I'm going to race hard,\" Logano said. \"I'm a racer. That's what I am. I've got one gear when I get in a race car ... it's to go win the race. To be a good race car driver, a lot of times you have to be selfish, you've got to think about what's best for your race team and I think that's kind of the approach I've taken over the years.\n\n\"Once I started racing that way, I've won a lot more races.\"\n\nHe also had to deal with the ire of some of his rivals, namely Kenseth in 2015. He and Kenseth had tangled on the track various times in that season, when Logano won six races, including three straight in the playoffs. One of those wins was at Kansas and Logano didn't need it to advance into the next round and the victory came at Kenseth's expense.\n\nLogano was unapologetic, made no effort to make peace with Kenseth, and Kenseth retaliated two weeks later by preventing Logano from winning at Martinsville Speedway to earn an automatic berth into the championship. Logano didn't recover and missed the final four.\n\nAll of those altercations \"make you tough as nails,\" Logano said, but also matured him into the driver he is now. The problems with Kenseth were a career-changer in that Logano now understands politics in racing stretch off the track and into the motorhome lot.\n\n\"I've learned how to handle situations,\" he said. \"You've got to go through things to learn things sometimes and you just have to learn things the hard way. It's not the fun way to learn things the hard way, but you do and not only does that help you on the race track, but for the rest of my life I'll be able to take those lessons with me.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP Auto Racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Warren, AP)\n\nBoeing didn't tell airline pilots about features of a new flight-control system in its 737 Max that reportedly is a focus of the investigation into last month's deadly crash in Indonesia, according to pilots who fly the jet in the U.S.\n\nPilots say they were not trained in new features of an anti-stall system in the aircraft that differ from previous models of the popular 737.\n\nThe automated system is designed to help pilots avoid raising the plane's nose too high, which can cause the plane to stall, or lose the aerodynamic lift needed to keep flying. The system automatically pushes the nose of the plane down.\n\nBut if that nose-down command is triggered by faulty sensor readings \u2014 as suspected in the Lion Air crash \u2014 pilots can struggle to control the plane, which can go into a dive and perhaps crash, according to a Boeing safety bulletin and safety regulators.\n\nThe bulletin included new details on how to stop a runaway series of events from leading to a crash, pilots say.\n\n\"It is something we did not have before in any of our training. It wasn't in our books. American didn't have it,\" said Dennis Tajer, a 737 pilot and spokesman for the pilots union at American Airlines. \"Now I have to wonder what else is there?\"\n\nJon Weaks, a 737 captain and president of the pilots union at Southwest, said he couldn't recall a similar omission in a Boeing operating manual.\n\n\"I was not pleased. How could something like this happen? We want to be given the information to keep our pilots, our passengers and our families safe,\" he said.\n\nWeaks said he is satisfied that \"we have been given, finally, the correct information.\"\n\nThe Max is the newest version of the twin-engine Boeing 737. More than 200 have been delivered to airlines worldwide, including American, Southwest and United.\n\nBoeing Chairman and CEO Dennis Muilenburg said Tuesday that the Chicago-based company remains confident the Max is a safe airplane. He said Boeing did not withhold operating details from airlines and flight crews.\n\n\"We ensure that we provide all of the information that is needed to safely fly our airplanes,\" Muilenburg told Fox Business Network. He said Boeing bulletins to airlines and pilots \"point them back to existing flight procedures\" to handle the kind of sensor problem suspected in last month's crash.\n\nA Southwest spokeswoman said the new automated maneuvering system was not included in the operating manual for Max models. An American spokesman said the airline was unaware of some new automated functions in the Max but hasn't experienced nose-direction errors. A United spokesman said Boeing and the FAA do not believe additional pilot training is needed.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency directive last week to airlines, telling them to update cockpit manuals to include instructions for how pilots can adjust flight controls under certain conditions.\n\n\"The FAA will take further action if findings from the accident investigation warrant,\" the agency said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nOn Oct. 29, Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta. All 189 people on board were killed.\n\nJohn Cox, a former 737 pilot and now a safety consultant to airlines, said Boeing's steps since the crash \"have been exactly correct. They have increased pilot awareness, they have reminded them of the proper procedure to disable (the automatic nose-down action), which stops the problem.\"\n\nIndonesian investigators say that the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 experienced malfunctions with sensors that indicate the angle of the nose on four recent flights, including the fatal one.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. and Indonesian investigators are increasingly focusing on the way that the plane's automated control systems interact. They are also questioning whether the FAA and Boeing adequately analyzed potential hazards if the systems malfunction and send faulty data to the plane's computers, according to the newspaper.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2018/11/14/pilots-says-boeing-didnt-disclose-new-control-feature-737-max/2001713002/", "", "I got a dog and unexpectedly became a better parent to my three daughters\n\nHere\u2019s the unexpected thing about being a dog owner to Chloe. All 8 pounds of her have made me a better parent to my three daughters.\n\nEvery few days one of my kids will ask, \u201cDo you love Chloe more than you love me?\u201d\n\nOr some variation like, \u201cIf the house was on fire and you could only save one of us or the dog, who would you choose?\u201d\n\nWe first spotted Chloe zipping around a front yard, tossing an empty yogurt cup in the air before attacking it with fury. She was a long-haired Chihuahua mix and the last of the litter. My husband and I still marvel at that today in the mushy voices reserved for dogs and babies. \u201cWhy last? You\u2019re the cutest, most special, most beautiful, most goo-goo-eyed good girl in the whole world.\u201d The owner of the puppies must have shielded Chloe \u2013 her favorite \u2013 from the public until no more puppies remained. That\u2019s how we explain that.\n\nWe drove home with Chloe in my lap, her chin resting on the yogurt cup between her paws. She was to be my 8-year-old's birthday present.\n\nBut it was clear to everyone: Chloe was mine.\n\nShe follows me from room to room. She greets me with the joyful relief of a reunited family when I return home. When I\u2019m napping and a kid disturbs me, she brings the same fury to them that she did that yogurt cup.\n\nRight to be suspicious\n\nMy kids have their reasons for asking who I love more. Consider:\n\nI say hello to Chloe first when I come home. But only because she\u2019s there waiting. My girls may not be bothered to look up from their electronic devices.\n\nBut only because she\u2019s there waiting. My girls may not be bothered to look up from their electronic devices. I labor over her snacks at the supermarket. Will she like this one? And didn\u2019t my dental hygienist say these snacks were bad for dogs? The kids get Goldfish, some fruit and I\u2019m done.\n\nWill she like this one? And didn\u2019t my dental hygienist say these snacks were bad for dogs? The kids get Goldfish, some fruit and I\u2019m done. I take A LOT of photos and videos of Chloe. She\u2019s a better subject than my kids. The girls stick out their tongues or snatch the iPhone from me and erase the most adorable pictures for fear it will ruin their street cred.\n\nAnd why shouldn\u2019t I lavish some extra attention on her? Unlike my kids, Chloe:\n\nComes when I call, tail wagging. My kids claim they fail to hear me. Every time.\n\ntail wagging. My kids claim they fail to hear me. Every time. Never says this is yucky at dinner. (At least not audibly.)\n\n(At least not audibly.) Gets in the car right when I say it's time to go. She doesn\u2019t complain that wherever we are going is boring. She doesn\u2019t make a rolling garbage can out of my car. She doesn't make rude comments about my choice of music.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t complain that wherever we are going is boring. She doesn\u2019t make a rolling garbage can out of my car. She doesn't make rude comments about my choice of music. Only whines when it\u2019s been too long since she\u2019s been outside or we fail to share our popcorn. My kids whine when we\u2019re out of their favorite cereal, their favorite school uniform skirt isn\u2019t hanging where they expect or another kid changed the TV channel.\n\nLittle dog, big impact\n\nHere\u2019s the unexpected thing about being a dog owner: All 8 pounds of her have made me a better parent. Let me count the ways ...\n\n1. I am more chill.\n\nI have bouts of teeth-grinding anxiety. But when she\u2019s beside me and I stroke her fur, it disappears. The anxiety slips away \u2013 subtly and without labor, unlike the deep breathing I practice. She\u2019s instant Prozac without the side effects. Happy mom, happy children.\n\n2. I check myself before I wreck myself.\n\nChloe doesn't like loud dissension in the house. Like most chihuahuas, she has the tremble factor. When I'm screeching at the kids that the living room looks like a wild frat party and I see Chloe shaking under the table, I bring it down a notch. Or two.\n\n3. I practice pack love.\n\nBeing near is enough.\n\nWhen the kids want me to watch some TV show with stupid parents, condescending kids and jokes I see coming from a mile away, I don't want to. But I do. Because Chloe demonstrates that being near your peeps is pack love, and it's important.\n\n4. I take breaks more often.\n\nIf I've been toiling away too long, usually on the computer, Chloe will offer a low growl. This means get up and do something else. She doesn't care that it has anything to do with her, but she, too, has been in the same spot for too long. That's good for me, but also my kids because after the break I'm reset. I'm out of my head and may actually be able to pay attention when one of my children is speaking.\n\n5. I forgive and forget. Faster.\n\nI can think of no finer example of how to practice forgiveness than my dog. Step on her tail, she yelps and is over it. She even licks your toes to let you know it\u2019s OK and she\u2019s sorry if she did anything to cause it. Think that doesn\u2019t translate into practicing fast forgiveness with your kids? You\u2019d be wrong because the buoyancy of being let off the hook for a wrong is so liberating that I want to pay it forward. Even to the kid who has kicked over the milk glass she put on the carpet for the upteenth time.\n\nDo I love her more?\n\nSo when the children ask, do you love Chloe more than you love us, I immediately say no. OK. Maybe first I like to watch them squirm a little.\n\nI don't love Chloe more. But I am, since she came into my life two years ago, definitely able to love you, dear children, better.\n\nLike All the Moms?

The United States play England in an international friendly soccer match at Wembley stadium in London on Thursday. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 Back with the United States for only the second time in an injury-troubled year, Christian Pulisic has watched the Americans rebuild from afar after their failure to qualify for the World Cup.\n\n\"I definitely need to be a more important piece of this team and continue to grow as a leader,\" the 20-year-old midfielder said ahead of Thursday's friendly against England. \"It's tough because I'm not a very vocal guy, not super outgoing. But I think the biggest thing I can do is lead by example. I want to show these guys how it's done on a professional level.\"\n\nPulisic is talking like a veteran and yet only debuted in March 2016. The Hershey, Pennsylvania, native has 21 appearances and nine goals, the last in the 2-1 loss at Trinidad and Tobago in October 2017 that ended the American's streak of seven straight World Cups. Pulisic's only appearance since has been in a friendly against Bolivia in May.\n\nHis focus has been getting playing time at Borussia Dortmund, a task frustrated by injuries. Pulisic didn't even make the bench Saturday when Dortmund beat Bundesliga champion Bayern Munich 3-2 to stay atop the standings. Pulisic confirmed he was \"100 percent\" fit last weekend.\n\n\"It's tough. I had some injuries going on and off, and I got some games that I missed out,\" Pulisic he said Wednesday. \"We have a great team this year. I want to be on the field just like everyone else does.\"\n\nPulisic inherited Landon Donovan's No. 10 jersey and his importance to the U.S. team.\n\nThe burden of pressure, too, at a young age, much like Wayne Rooney experienced with England. Now 33 and finishing his career in Major League Soccer, the D.C. United striker is making a one-off England return after a two-year absence and will make his 120th appearances.\n\n\"I can definitely look up to a guy like that,\" Pulisic said of Rooney, a five-time Premier League champion with Manchester United.\n\nRooney was part of an England \"golden generation\" that failed to live up to the hype. With a more low-key approach and most players unscarred by past setbacks, England in July unexpectedly reached its first World Cup semifinal in 28 years.\n\n\"It's an inspiration for us,\" Pulisic said. \"We definitely feel that with the young side that we can we can also do something like that. That's the goal for us.\"\n\nPulisic has spoken with new U.S. team general manager Earnie Stewart, who says he will hire the next U.S. coach later this year, putting the new regime in place ahead of next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup. After that will be qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Pulisic figures to be in the prime of his career when the U.S. co-hosts the 2026 tournament with Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe American midfield of the future could be on the field together for the first time at Wembley: Pulisic, 19-year-old Tyler Adams and 20-year-old Weston McKennie, perhaps joined by Tim Weah, the 18-year-old son of former FIFA Player of the Year \u2014 and current Liberia president \u2014 George Weah.\n\n\"We have a lot of brave young players and guys who aren't afraid to come in and show us what they know about the game,\" Pulisic said. \"Guys can't come in to be shy and expect us to kind of show them the ropes. They've got to come in and they've got to show what they can do it and be competent with it.\"\n\nPulisic is friends with McKennie, also based in Germany. Adams is expected to move there, too, this winter, leaving MLS's New York Red Bulls for sister club RB Leipzig.\n\n\"We want to help out the young guys ... as much as we can,\" Pulisic said. \"We also still have a lot to learn.\"\n\nPlaying in Germany helps.\n\n\"The Bundesliga has been a great platform,\" Pulisic said. \"They trust their young players, and Dortmund has been an unbelievable start to my career.\"\n\nInevitably when visiting England, talk will turn to whether Pulisic envisages a move to the Premier League. His Dortmund contract ends in 2020.\n\n\"I'm still enjoying every moment of it,\" he said. \"When the time comes, that's when I have my talks my Dortmund and see what I want to do moving forward.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Seriously, it\u2019s concerning.\n\nHe puts ketchup on steak. In fact, he puts ketchup on almost everything.\n\nIf there\u2019s one positive to come from this revelation, it\u2019s that Mahomes is self aware about how frowned up ruining a steak with ketchup is in society. Being a breakout NFL star means people recognize Mahomes in public and watch in horror as he puts ketchup on steak. He\u2019s tried to curtail that habit in public.\n\nVia ESPN:\n\nThe other day, in Mahomes\u2019 apartment in the Country Club Plaza neighborhood of Kansas City, his grandfather asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be famous?\u201d For one thing, it means he eats less ketchup. He spent most of his life putting ketchup on everything. He would get bottles of it for his birthday. But now that everyone is watching every move he makes, he is sheepish about ordering ketchup. At a restaurant recently, his mom, Randi, recognized an unfilled desire as he dove into a steak. \u201cJust ask for it,\u201d Randi said. \u201cI know you want it.\u201d Patrick wouldn\u2019t. So she asked for the ketchup and slipped it to him.\n\nIt\u2019s a little disappointing that his own mother would support destruction of a perfectly good steak. Peer pressure aside \u2014 ketchup on steak is gross.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe it\u2019s the secret behind throwing a football 90 yards. He might be onto something.", "Author and Nobel Peace prize winner Elie Wiesel, photographed in his New York office on Jan. 29, 2009. (Photo: Todd Plitt, USA TODAY)\n\nElie Wiesel is best known as a Holocaust survivor and a writer whose works, such as \"Night,\" called attention to the importance of remembrance and the need to prevent further inhumanity.\n\nBut while the Nobel Peace Prize winner - who died in 2016 at age 87 - taught millions of people around the globe lessons of faith and activism, many forget he was a professional educator, too.\n\nFor decades, he taught at Boston University, where his courses were among the most popular on campus.\n\nA new book chronicles those lectures and classroom interactions. Witness: Lessons from Elie Wiesel's Classroom (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 259 pp., \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four) is by Ariel Burger, who met the master writer when he was 15, studied under him in his 20s and served as his teaching assistant in his 30s.\n\nBurger transports the reader to those salons of learning on the Charles River, where Wiesel's students over the years ranged from the granddaughter of a Nazi SS officer to a Korean minister in training.\n\nUnlike the best-selling \"Tuesdays with Morrie\" \u2013 which highlighted author Mitch Albom's relationship with another Boston-area professor \u2013 Burger's book has a protagonist who was already world-famous.\n\n\"Witness: Lessons From Elie Wiesel's Classroom' (Photo: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)\n\nWitness does have a Wednesdays-with-Wiesel feel. Burger intersperses bits of his own life and background as he shares an album's worth of snapshots from Wiesel's time at BU. Burger's tone and execution are exactly what his title promises \u2013 and in keeping with the way Wiesel lived his life.\n\nHere are three lessons for those who never sat in a classroom with Wiesel:\n\n1. Why faith remains after horror.\n\nWiesel's book Night is part of the canon not only of Holocaust writing, but American literature. According to Burger, Wiesel rarely taught his most famous volume, but he made an exception for the 2006 fall semester at the request of students. (That was the year Oprah Winfrey selected \"Night,\" an autobiographical account of his family's deportation by the Nazis to the Auschwitz death camp and then Buchenwald, for her book club.)\n\nTheology and suffering were among the topics addressed.\n\n\"I believe in a wounded faith. Only a wounded faith can exist after those events,\" he told his class, adding, \"(W)e cannot conceive of that place with God or without God. It is impossible to pray. But I did, and I said that prayer, because my father said it, his father, his grandfather. How could I be the last?\"\n\n2. It's essential to fight hate.\n\nWiesel lived a history he never wanted to see repeated. He assembled activists and thinkers in conferences called \"Anatomy of Hate\" to explore why, decades after the Holocaust, people continued to annihilate those different from themselves.\n\nAuthor Ariel Burger. (Photo: Maor Ziv-Kreger)\n\n\"When you face evil, don't let it grow, fight it right away,\" he said. \"Anyone who is suffering, anyone who is threatened becomes your responsibility...It is not the end \u2013 I do not know how to end hatred, I truly wish I did \u2013 but recognizing our shared humanity is a good beginning.\"\n\n3. The power of words, for good and evil.\n\nBurger, like his mentor, knows that the 26 letters in the alphabet, arranged into endless combinations of thoughts, can effect change \u2013 or destroy.\n\n\"Language is essential. It is more than a vehicle to transmit ideas or memories; it is a desire of the human being to transcend his own limits,\" Wiesel told students. \"But language can be corrupted. It can be contaminated by human cruelty.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Zlati Meyer on Twitter: @ZlatiMeyer\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2018/11/14/elie-wiesels-classroom-lessons-holocaust-book-witness-ariel-burger-book-review/1897795002/", "", "", "FILE - In this Nov. 9, 2018, file photo, Syracuse defensive lineman Alton Robinson, top, sacks Louisville quarterback Jawon Pass during the second half of an NCAA college football game, in Syracuse, N.Y.

The team announced Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018, that it has extended Rutherford's contract through the 2021-22 season. His old deal was set to expire at the end of this season. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Jim Rutherford celebrated a new contract in the most expected of ways: by putting together a trade he hopes will jump-start his struggling team.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins general manager signed a contract extension on Wednesday that will keep him with the club through the 2021-22 season. Moments later he dealt forward Carl Hagelin to the Los Angeles Kings for forward Tanner Pearson.\n\nAll of it unfolded as Penguins captain Sidney Crosby skipped practice while being evaluated for an upper-body injury. Just another busy day for the 69-year-old Rutherford.\n\nThe only general manager to win Stanley Cups with multiple teams in the expansion era remains fervently committed to his job, which is why he didn't hesitate to make a trade that sent the speedy but slumping Hagelin to the Kings for the younger Pearson, the first of what could be several moves as Pittsburgh tries to shake itself out of a 7-6-3 start.\n\n\"Despite the fact it hasn't been a happy couple of weeks with the Penguins as a whole, I'm very happy to be staying and will do my best to fix it,\" Rutherford said.\n\nThe Penguins hired Rutherford in the summer of 2014 to replace Ray Shero. Under his guidance, the Penguins revamped their roster and their coaching staff, surrounding Crosby and Evgeni Malkin with a talented group that helped Pittsburgh become the first franchise in nearly 20 years to win consecutive Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017.\n\nHagelin scored the empty-net goal that clinched the 2017 Cup, racing down the ice in the final seconds of Game 6 to set off a giddy celebration on the bench. Yet Hagelin's production dipped last year. He finished with just 10 goals \u2014 the fewest in his career in a season in which he played at least 65 games \u2014 and had just one goal this year before the trade was announced.\n\n\"I feel bad,\" Rutherford said. \"Carl Hagelin is a very popular guy and I like him a lot personally ... at the same time we're not tracking toward winning a Stanley Cup right now and changes are necessary.\"\n\nHagelin is in the final season of a contract that pays him $4 million annually. Pearson, 26, has two more seasons left on his deal that is worth around $3.75 million per year. Pearson has averaged 40 points in each of the past three seasons, but had just one point \u2014 an assist \u2014 in 17 games with the Kings this season. He could be available as early as Thursday night when the Penguins host Tampa Bay.\n\n\"He's shown an ability to produce offensively ... he's a decent skater ... he's got a good 200-foot game,\" Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. \"We'll see where we slot him here over the next little while.\"\n\nThe Penguins could certainly use a boost. They have dropped five of six, the longest extended slide of Rutherford's largely successful four-plus year tenure. The man nicknamed \"Trader Jim\" for his aggressive approach to addressing problems insists he still has plenty of juice left to keep going even as his 70th birthday approaches in February. It's a far cry from the day he was hired when he said he anticipated working a few more seasons.\n\n\"I said at the time I'd probably be around a couple years,\" Rutherford said. \"I guess I went a couple years at a time. Two times two and we're still counting. You never know.\"\n\nFor now his attention is focused on helping the star-laden Penguins emerge from another early malaise.\n\nCrosby played more than 21 minutes and didn't miss a shift during Tuesday night's 4-2 loss to New Jersey. His absence at practice on Wednesday was a surprise, though Sullivan offered few details. It doesn't appear to be a long-term problem, however, though Pittsburgh's issues are far larger than just health. They are having trouble preventing goals and the offense for once isn't picking up the slack.\n\n\"I just think we're in a funk now, we're a fragile team,\" Rutherford said. \"We're struggling but for the most part I still believe in this team. ... Everybody wants to win a championship and I believe we still can.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Jutanugarn is already the LPGA's player of the year and leading moneywinner this season. She'll look to cap the season with a win in the CME Group Tour Championship that begins Thursday, Nov. 15. (AP Photo/Butch Dill, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNAPLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Ariya Jutanugarn is occasionally fearful on the golf course, which might seem peculiar given her resume.\n\nShe's already clinched the LPGA's player of the year award, her second in the last three seasons. She's already clinched the money title, also for the second time in three years. She's back to No. 1 in the world rankings, will almost certainly have the lowest scoring average on tour this year and finished in the top 10 more regularly than any of her fellow competitors.\n\nIf all that wasn't enough, she has the best chance this week at the season-ending tour championship that starts Thursday at Tiburon Golf Club of capturing the Race to the CME Globe \u2014 which comes with a $1 million bonus.\n\nSo still playing scared at times, that's a puzzler.\n\n\"I just want to improve myself every day,\" Jutanugarn said. \"I know I have so much room (to) improve. ... Every time when I go out and play I always have some different situation. Sometimes I worry. Sometimes I'm scared. Sometimes I feel so confident to play golf.\"\n\nThe confident moments seem like they override the worrisome and fearful ones.\n\nShe got hot at the right time in 2018 \u2014 winning twice in May, the second of those being the U.S. Women's Open, then grabbing the Scottish Open victory in July. She's been tied for third or better in three of her last four starts, and went 67-67 on the weekend to prevail at the tour championship on this southwest Florida track last year.\n\nJutanugarn won't carry a driver this week \u2014 she's 122nd this season in driving accuracy \u2014 but she seems to rarely have trouble scoring. She leads the LPGA in birdies, is third in putting average and is even 13th in driving distance despite her disdain for using what ordinarily is the biggest club in the bag.\n\n\"I want to play well, I want to hit this shot good because I care about other people, what they're going to be thinking about me,\" Jutanugarn said. \"But then I have to come back to myself and know that other people's expectation is not my expectation. I have to know what is my expectation, because I expect to have a good commitment with every shot. I expect myself to have fun, enjoy, and feel free on the course.\"\n\nShe's one of five women in the field who have the simplest path to winning the CME Globe: Win the tournament, and the trophy and bonus are theirs. Minjee Lee, Brooke Henderson, Nasa Hataoka and Sung Hyun Park are the others; five who are assured of winning the Globe if they win the tournament. There are seven other women with a mathematical chance,\n\n\"One of my main goals this year was to be in the top five coming into this event so that I could have this opportunity,\" Henderson said. \"I've been really fortunate that for the past three years I've been in position if I play well this week that I could walk away with that $1 million, which is pretty special. I think it all comes down to you need to have a really great week.\"\n\nIt's the third consecutive year where Henderson has come to Naples \u2014 she's Canadian, but now has a home about 30 minutes away from Tiburon \u2014 with a chance to win the Globe and the bonus money.\n\nShe still doesn't know what she'd do if she won the extra $1 million.\n\n\"I've been asked that the last three years, and I'm still not really sure,\" Henderson said. \"But just the opportunity to be here, I'm really grateful. Hopefully I can do something special this week.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

USA TODAY\n\nViggo Mortensen has captivated audiences by his deep dive into a bigoted, Italian-American driver in his new film, \"Green Book.\" (Photo: Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY)\n\nCorrections and clarifications: A previous version of this story mischaracterized Viggo Mortensen\u2019s nationality. He is Danish-American.\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 It was the third course, really, that did him in.\n\nViggo Mortensen was prepping for \u201cGreen Book\u201d (in major markets Friday), in which he packs on the pounds to play a working class Italian-American, Tony Lip (real name: Frank Anthony Vallelonga). In the film, Lip checks his racism in 1962 New York to earn an income chauffeuring a world-class black pianist, Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), in the Deep South.\n\nMortensen, 60, who is Danish-American, recalls flying in from his home in Spain to meet Tony's descendants at a New Jersey red-sauce joint still owned by the family.\n\nAnd the Italian food just kept coming. \u201cOh my God,\" he says. \"The first thing was, 'Let\u2019s go to the kitchen and have (Tony's wife) Dolores\u2019 meatballs.' But I was already full. I hadn\u2019t gained all that weight or expanded my stomach (yet).\u201d Then came the antipasti, and a second course, and a third. Mortensen struggled to finish his plate. \u201cAnd then they\u2019re looking at me like, 'He doesn\u2019t like it.' ... 'No, no!

(While discussing the era at a recent Q&A for the film, Mortensen invoked a racial slur in describing what\u2019s no longer permissible, for which he has since apologized.)\n\nBut the movie, which is largely a road comedy, also is based on a real travel guide. The Green Book, which began publication in the 1930s, was a pamphlet that mapped where African-Americans could find safe lodging across the country. Before filming, the cast thumbed through old copies.\n\nCLOSE Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen's characters come from two different social worlds, but the common ground they find in \"Green Book\" can speak to us all. USA TODAY\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty straightforward,\" Mortensen says. \"And they\u2019re not that thick, because obviously the farther South you get, there\u2019s not that many places they could stay.\u201d\n\nAli compares a 1960s-era AAA travel guide to a Green Book: \"One is saying, 'Explore America! This is how you come see Niagara Falls or the Grand Canyon or the Alamo!' ... And the other one is telling you, as a black person, 'This is how you survive when you get there and not die.'\n\n\"What year can you point to and say that's when the mentality changed? That this was all open to all of us?\" asks Ali, who signed on to \"Green Book\" shortly after winning his first Oscar for \"Moonlight\" in 2017.\n\nAs Tony and Doc Shirley drive farther South, where the classically trained musician's wealthy, white audience throws open their salon doors but won\u2019t let him use their bathrooms, a deeper appreciation of each other grows. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a movie about the limitations of first impressions,\u201d Mortensen says.\n\nTony Lip (Viggo Mortensen, right) is driver, confidante and security for famous pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a 1962 concert tour of the South in the comedy-drama \"Green Book.\" (Photo: UNIVERSAL PICTURES)\n\nPrognosticators are paving a road to Oscar for \"Green Book,\u201d which boasts a 92% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film quietly entered the Toronto International Film Festival in September, emerging with the festival\u2019s top prize. Now the film is predicted to be a top contender for the best-picture Oscar.\n\nThe reaction at that first screening shocked even those who made \"Green Book.\" \"We all started crying, because we had never played it before for a big crowd,\" says director Peter Farrelly.\n\nMany Hollywood insiders also believe it\u2019s Mortensen\u2019s turn to win a gold statue, after two best-actor nods for \"Captain Fantastic\" and \"Eastern Promises.\" On the awards prediction site GoldDerby.com, he has 4-to-1 odds of edging out Bradley Cooper (\"A Star is Born\") and Christian Bale (\"Vice\").\n\nGoldDerby founder Tom O'Neil calls \"Green Book\" a \"sleeping giant\" at the Oscars this year that could trigger \"lots of upsets.\" And despite a tight race for best actor, \"Viggo has some strong pluses,\" he says, citing the actor's radical physical transformation and the respect he holds inside Hollywood. \"Voters love to catch up with beloved industry veterans who are ridiculously overdue to win.\"\n\nAway from the red carpet, Mortensen lives by his own rules. He's still the proud owner of a flip phone, his one Luddite pleasure (well, aside from sending postcards to friends), and is in the midst of a self-made avalanche of responsibilities: an upcoming film he\u2019s directing, a publishing house he runs, a new book of Spanish poetry he\u2019s releasing.\n\nHe knows himself: \u201cIf I added social media and Instagram and Twitter, I\u2019d never get anything done.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/11/14/viggo-mortensen-just-may-win-oscar-last-green-book/1993984002/", "FILE - In this Nov. 10, 2018, file photo, Central Florida linebacker Gabriel Luyanda, left, and linebacker Nate Evans celebrate after the team recovered a fumble during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Navy, in Orlando, Fla.

As part of his deal, Barriss will serve at least 20 years in prison.\n\n\"Swatting\" is a practice where an individual makes a phony call to 911 to force police to respond with SWAT teams.\n\nLast year, Barriss was arrested by L.A. police, accused of making a fake 911 call in response to an argument with an online gamer while playing \"Call of Duty,\" a video game.\n\nAuthorities said Barriss made the call, giving police what he thought was the other gamer's address and claiming there was a hostage situation.\n\nPolice in Kansas arrived at the home of Andrew Finch, 28, who had no connection to the gamers.

(Photo: Edward C Baig)\n\nA perfect photo-op has presented itself. Well, perfect, that is, except for one critical problem: There\u2019s barely any light.\n\nYou could fire up a flash, but the results are often unsatisfactory. Besides, in some places using a flash is prohibited altogether. And a flash won\u2019t do you much good if what you want to shoot is a landscape.\n\nWhen Google launched the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL smartphones recently it promised a Night Sight feature that would address such problems, by letting you take pictures in dimly-lit places without a flash.\n\nOver the next few days, Night Sight will be coming to the latest Pixels, and the previous two generations of Google\u2019s Pixel phones, through an update to the Camera app. The feature works on both the front and rear cameras on these devices.\n\nMore: With Pixel 3 and Home Hub, Google wants its devices to be not just smart but 'thoughtful'\n\nI\u2019ve gotten to try the Night Sight ahead of time, using a Pixel 3 XL. I got decent albeit imperfect results. I was quite pleased with some night-time shots of my kids in the backyard, and in at least one instance with an indoor shot of my daughter taken in a dark room.\n\nWould you have known that this shot of Sydney Baig was taken in a dark room? It was captured on a Google Pixel 3 XL with the Night Sight feature. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nBut some images were badly pixelated, with the flaws especially visible if you zoom in on a picture. And a shot of the trees in my neighborhood came out a bit blurry and made nighttime look a bit like dusk.\n\nStill, most Night Sight pictures I took are more than Instagram-worthy. I had already reaped praise on the Pixel 3 XL camera in a prior review. The addition of Night Sight makes the already excellent camera here all the better.\n\nThe way Google explains Night Sight, the feature constantly adapts to you and your surroundings, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re holding the Pixel yourself or propping it on a steady surface. Before you press the shutter button, Night Sight measures your natural hand shake, and how much motion is in the scene. If Night Sight detects a still and stable scene, the camera will capture more light to minimize noise; if the Pixel does detect movement in the scene or by the shooter, Night Sight will use shorter exposures, capturing less light to minimize motion blur.\n\nSydney Baig in the backyards in a photo taken without a flash through the Night Shift mode on a Google Pixel. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nGoogle adds that if your subject moves, instead of capturing one bright and blurry photo, Night Sight will grab an equal amount of light over a burst of many dark but sharp photos. It will then merge the burst to help prevent motion blur and brighten the photo.\n\nWhen you launch the Camera app In some low light settings, you may see a notification suggesting you use Night Sight. But you can also manually turn on the setting.\n\nA backyard photo of Samuel Baig taken with the Night Sight feature on a Google Pixel phone. (Photo: Edward C.

Win line of scrimmage\n\nThe Seahawks are a tough, physical team dependent on pounding the football and controlling the line of scrimmage. Can the Packers recover in time and play with the right amount of energy and physicality up front? This is a game that will be won or lost up front. The Packers have the horsepower along the offensive and defensive lines to grind out a win, but they\u2019ll need to come out the gates firing. Matching Seattle\u2019s effort early will be key.\n\n2. Feed Aaron Jones\n\nThe Seahawks might have the top-ranked rushing offense in football, but the Packers can counter with the NFL\u2019s most efficient rushing offense, and they\u2019ll be facing a defense giving up 5.0 yards per carry this season. The game plan should be centered around Jones, who is averaging 6.8 yards per carry and coming off a career-best 145 yards rushing Sunday. The Packers need to make the Seahawks prove they win at the point of attack and maintain gap integrity for 60 minutes. Jones doesn\u2019t need much of a crease to rip off a big play.\n\n3. Turnover Russell Wilson\n\nThe Packers have produced 11 takeaways of Wilson in the last four meetings, including five interceptions in a blowout win at Lambeau Field in 2016 and a crucial, game-turning fumble recovery in Week 1 last season. Turnovers change games. Just ask the Seahawks, who have lost two straight games in part due to late giveaways. Wilson threw a pick-six in the fourth quarter of Seattle\u2019s loss to the Chargers and then lost a fumble \u2013 leading to a Rams touchdown \u2013 in last week\u2019s loss in Los Angeles. The Packers used a Bashaud Breeland interception to help put away the Dolphins on Sunday. Can they get another big takeaway or two in Seattle?\n\n4. Play clean on special teams\n\nThe Packers were able to survive a half-dozen notable special teams mistakes and still take down a beat up Dolphins team Sunday at Lambeau Field, but everyone knows what happens when the special teams implode against a good team on the road, especially in Seattle. More critical errors would make it very difficult to win away from home in a tough environment. The Packers have to give themselves a chance by playing a clean game.\n\n5. Start fast\n\nThere\u2019s no better way to quiet a crowd, bleed a stadium of energy and create a necessary cushion than starting fast and building confidence early. These are going to be tired teams taking the field Thursday night. The Packers can\u2019t afford to let the Seahawks get the crowd involved early. That could energize the home team and put the visitors in a tough spot, especially playing two time zones away on three day\u2019s rest. Whichever team starts fast could run away with it. The Packers need to be that team.", "The Challenge, otherwise known as America\u2019s fifth major sport (watch out hockey, it\u2019s coming for you) is in the middle of a season in which the winners will receive $1 million.

In order to do so, we\u2019ve tasked our resident Challenge expert Charles Curtis with power ranking the remaining teams based on the latest episode \u2026\n\nNOTE: THE FINALE IS COMING UP! So we\u2019re going to do this a little differently with the pros and cons for each team that\u2019s running in the final challenge.\n\nIt all comes down to this.

JOSS AND SYLVIA\n\nPROS: Joss has proven he\u2019s the muscle to Sylvia\u2019s brains, although let\u2019s give Sylvia some credit, she\u2019s survived some tough physical challenges as well. The two of them are working beautifully together and they made a big power move with Hunter and Ashley to eventually send Bananas and Tony home. In a final that will pack in puzzles and physicality, these two should be the favorites going in.\n\nCONS: As I\u2019ve mentioned in previous editions of The Challenge power rankings, Sylvia keeps talking about how she doesn\u2019t run. That may prove to be a HUGE problem since final challenges usually involve lots of running.\n\n2. NATALIE AND PAULIE\n\nPROS: Another team that\u2019s worked together to navigate this minefield of a season. Natalie proved for the third or fourth time this season that she doesn\u2019t need to be the biggest or strongest to keep up \u2014 she outlasted Bananas by holding up her arms for FIVE AND A HALF HOURS in their Armageddon and has the battle scar from another one on her chin. Paulie has figured out how to channel his fire, and the pair might shock everyone.\n\nCONS: Paulie is a rookie, although that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t win \u2014 first-timers have done it before. Still, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re in for.\n\n3. ASHLEY AND HUNTER\n\nPROS: Ashley is a previous final winner \u2014 Invasion of the Champions \u2014 and Hunter played minor league baseball. We know when it comes to out-running other teams, they\u2019re probably the favorites.\n\nCONS: The problem is they continue to bicker and blame each other, and with the possibility that one might win and take all the money a la Johnny Bananas, you worry about their heads and ability to work together. If there\u2019s one moment either Ashley or Hunter fall behind, the blame game could derail them quickly.\n\n4. CARA MARIA AND MARIE\n\nPROS: Cara Maria won Vendettas and Battle of the Bloodlines, so she knows how to handle a final. And it\u2019s been heartening to see these two \u2014 who hated each other so much heading into this season \u2014 put their differences aside and work through a game that\u2019s been very much against them all year.\n\nCONS: Marie has improved over the year, but can she dominate in a final?", "At the NFL trade deadline, the Baltimore Ravens made a deal with the Green Bay Packers for running back Ty Montgomery, giving up a seventh-round pick in 2020. According to coach John Harbaugh, Montgomery could make his Ravens debut this week against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nCoach Harbaugh gives an update on Ty Montgomery's process with the offense: pic.twitter.com/gnHkybHnse \u2014 Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) November 14, 2018\n\nMontgomery wasn\u2019t active for Week 9 against the Pittsburgh Steelers after taking part in only a few practices with the team. After the bye and a full week of practice, Montgomery could have captured enough of the playbook to play in a critical game against the Bengals.\n\nHarbaugh noted the next three practices would be important for Montgomery. With a completely new playbook and new terminology to learn to be competent in Baltimore\u2019s scheme, Montgomery can show in practice he\u2019s ready.\n\nThe Ravens are hoping Montgomery can help their struggling offense. Baltimore is getting the second-fewest yards per attempt from their rushing attack in the NFL. Though that has largely been due to poor blocking by the offensive line and a willingness to abandon the run far too early by offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg rather than the play of the running backs. Still, Montgomery could offer a spark both on the ground as well as a receiving threat and return specialist.\n\nIn seven games with the Packers this season, Montgomery had 26 carries for 105 yards and a touchdown, along with 15 catches for 170 yards. On special teams, he returned 10 kickoffs for 210 yards, though he had a critical fumble in a Week 8 loss, two days before he was traded.\n\nWith the Ravens sitting at 4-5, they could use all the positive sparks they can get. A win against Cincinnati could catapult them to the No. 6 seed, while a loss would all but kick them out of the playoff race given tiebreaker scenarios.\n\nGallery 16 best photos of Ty Montgomery with Packers, Stanford", "", "The dirtiest play in college basketball has already been decided a week into the season.\n\nVideo circulated on Twitter Wednesday from Tuesday\u2019s Division III game between Fitchburg State and Nichols.

Update: Full video of the incident showed that he was ejected. The box score and play-by-play saying that Platt remained in the game were incorrect.\n\nObviously, Division III basketball doesn\u2019t have the benefit of video replay, so the flagrant contact wasn\u2019t reviewed during the game. We also don\u2019t know what led to the contact \u2014 Platt was called for a technical early in the first half. He led Fitchburg State scorers with 16 points.\n\nWhen reached by For The Win, MASCAC Commissioner Angela Baumann issued the following statement about Platt\u2019s indefinite suspension:\n\n\u201cThe MASCAC and Fitchburg State University take this incident very seriously. We are appalled by the actions of the student-athlete.\n\n\u201cHe has been indefinitely suspended from the team and barred from campus. In addition, the case is under review by Fitchburg State for consideration of further sanctions. The MASCAC has also vacated his player of the week award. His behavior goes against the MASCAC\u2019s mission which includes good sportsmanship. On behalf of the MASCAC and Fitchburg State, we apologize to the Nichols College student-athlete, the team and institution.\u201d\n\nNichols went on to win the game, 84-75.", "", "CLOSE Cord cutting is getting complicated. How do you know which of the major streaming services -- Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, not to mention many smaller ones -- is best to you? Kim Komando walks you through your options. Kim Komando, special for USA TODAY\n\nCord-cutting has changed the game for cable companies. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe latest cord-cutting statistics just keep getting worse.\n\nTV industry analysts last week had already tallied up the losses for the major pay-TV players as about 1.1 million defections for the three-month period ending Sept. 30 \u2013 one of the worst quarters in recent history.\n\nNow, market tracker S&P Global Market Intelligence says the exodus was even larger \u2013 1.2 million \u2013 during the period. Overall, that left cable, satellite and telco TV providers with about 91 million subscribers, 88.2 million of those being residential customers, the research firm says.\n\nSatellite TV providers had their worst quarter on record with a loss of 726,000 subscribers, the firm says. Cable operators have been hit with a tough trend, too. So far this year, they have lost nearly 1.1 million subscribers, their worst losses at the three-quarter mark since 2014.\n\nSo far this year, traditional pay-TV providers have lost 2.8 million subscribers.\n\nSubscriptions for broadband-delivered TV services such as DirecTV Now, Hulu, Sling TV, YouTube TV and PlayStation Vue have not quite offset those losses, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Those services have collectively gained 2.1 million subscriptions this year.\n\n\"People have embraced them,\" S&P senior research analyst Tony Lenoir said. \"There's a lot of competition from streaming services out there.

Browns general manager John Dorsey says interim coach Gregg Williams will be interviewed to be team\u2019s next coach.

The 60-year-old Williams coached Buffalo in 2001-03. (AP Photo/Ron Schwane, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nBEREA, Ohio (AP) \u2014 As John Dorsey prepares to make a critical decision he knows may shape Cleveland's football fortunes, the Browns general manager spends a moment every day giving himself a pep talk.\n\nAnd a stern warning.\n\n\"Just make sure you don't mess it up, that's what I tell myself,\" Dorsey said. \"Just don't mess this thing up.\"\n\nDorsey is in the early stages of heading his first coaching search with the Browns, who have been in a futile pursuit of a competent leader for nearly as long as they've been looking for a quarterback.\n\nWith the Browns (3-6-1) on their bye this week, Dorsey provided some insight into a quest that will accelerate once the season is completed and conclude with Cleveland's ninth coach since 1999.\n\nAs expected, Dorsey said interim coach Gregg Williams will be one of the candidates interviewed. Dorsey has been impressed with the job that Williams, the team's fiery defensive coordinator, has done over the past two weeks since taking over for Hue Jackson, who was fired on Oct. 29 after going just 3-36-1 in two-plus seasons.\n\nThe Browns beat Atlanta 28-16 on Sunday and have split their two games under the 60-year-old Williams, who Dorsey feels he has provided more than stability.\n\n\"I've always been a believer of you play the game like you practice and I think these practices have been very competitive,\" Dorsey said. \"They've been very structured, they've been very disciplined, and guys have had some energy and that's the difference I see. There's been a focus on the little things which I think is important.\"\n\nWilliams has previous head coaching experience with Buffalo from 2001-2003. He was also the defensive coordinator in New Orleans from 2009-2011, when he guided a group that won the Super Bowl but was also embroiled in the \"Bountygate\" scandal that resulted in him being suspended by the NFL for one season.\n\nBesides Williams, Dorsey has been pleased with how Cleveland's offense has played under running backs coach Freddie Kitchens, who took over play-calling duties when coordinator Todd Haley was fired the same day as Jackson. Dorsey would not speculate on Kitchens' future with the team, but said he \"has done a heck of a job.\"\n\nDorsey would not divulge who else in upper Cleveland's management team will help him find a coach, but he was adamant the Browns will not hire an outside firm to assist, which is something owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam have done in the past.\n\n\"We don't need that,\" he snapped.\n\nDorsey was tight-lipped on other aspects of the search, including whether he would be willing to hire a college coach with no pro experience. However, he did outline the traits he's seeking in a new coach.\n\n\"For me personally, I would like to see a man of character,\" he said. \"I would like to see a man who can lead young men. I would like a man who has high football acumen. Those are the three basic things there I'm looking for.\"\n\nDorsey promised to be as publicly quiet about the search as he was earlier this year when he kept Cleveland's No. 1 draft pick a well-guarded secret before choosing quarterback Baker Mayfield.\n\nThat selection is part of why Dorsey feels Cleveland's coaching gig is so appealing. Mayfield is showing signs of growth and along with rookie running back Nick Chubb, defensive end Myles Garrett, wide receiver Jarvis Landry and others, the Browns have a talented core of young players. The Browns also have nearly $60 million in salary cap space, a rabid fan base, 11 draft picks in 2019 and committed owners fixated on winning.\n\n\"Those are exciting things for this organization moving forward,\" he said. \"Anybody, once they understand that, you will see that, you know what? Cleveland is a good place to be.\"\n\nNOTES: Dorsey had little to say about Jackson returning to Cincinnati as a special assistant to Bengals coach Marvin Lewis. \"I wish him the best,\" he said. \"It was hard a couple of weeks ago.\" ... Dorsey would not say if he intends to interview former Arizona coach Bruce Arians, who is retired and doing TV analysis but has expressed interest in Cleveland's opening. \"I have a lot of respect for coach Arians,\" Dorsey said. \"Right now, we are in the process of beginning to finalize our plan. If it comes to the appropriate time and if he happens to be one of the people, you will find out.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nNetflix is experimenting with a half-price, mobile-only subscription to its popular streaming service. The catch? For now you have to live someplace such as Malaysia.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California-headquartered company confirmed it is currently testing a mobile-only subscription in some countries including Malaysia. Malaysian news site The Star Online first reported the test, which TechCrunch subsequently wrote up.\n\nThe mobile-only subscription is priced at about $4, half that of the basic service Netflix offers in Malaysia. Subscribers to the plan can watch on one handheld device such as a smartphone or tablet. Video is delivered in standard definition, not high-def.\n\n\"We are always looking for ways to make Netflix more enjoyable and more accessible to people all over the world,\" Netflix said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"In this case, we are testing to understand consumer interest in a mobile-only plan in some countries. Generally, we try out lots of new ideas at any given time, and they can vary in how long they last and who sees them. We may not ever roll out the features or elements included in a test.\"\n\nLast week, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings told Bloomberg the net TV provider planned to test a lower-priced subscription to boost sales in international markets including Asia. Netflix currently has 137.1 million subscribers globally, 57 percent of them outside the U.S.\n\nMobile subscriptions could eventually drive huge growth for the company. Hastings noted the massive installed base of smartphones in India last month while discussing Netflix's third-quarter performance with analysts.\n\nFor instance, India has more than 300 million households but almost twice as many mobile phone subscriptions. \"So there's a huge market, and people in India, like around the world, love watching television,\" Hastings said. \"Now we'll take it a million at a time and figure out how to expand the market as we grow.\"\n\nNetflix has tested different subscriber offerings in different markets. Earlier this year, the streaming company tested a higher-priced premium \"Ultra\" subscription in Europe offering 4K Ultra HD video with High Dynamic Range (HDR) quality and the ability to watch on four screens at the same time for 17 euros, or about $20.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2018/11/14/netflix-testing-cheaper-mobile-only-version-its-service/1998516002/", "", "Jemel Roberson, father of a baby named Tristan, was fatally shot Sunday. (Photo: AP)\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 A security guard who was shot to death by police outside a suburban Chicago bar this week was given \u201cmultiple verbal commands\u201d to drop his weapon before an officer fired, Illinois State Police said in preliminary findings.\n\nJemel Roberson, 26, who worked as an armed guard at Manny's Blue Room Lounge, was pinning down a suspect outside the bar in Robbins, Illinois, early Sunday morning when the police officer shot him.\n\nThe person Roberson apprehended had allegedly fired a weapon inside the bar moments earlier, wounding multiple people and drawing police from surrounding jurisdictions to rush to the establishment.\n\nThe officer from neighboring Midlothian who killed Roberson saw a man decked out in \u201cplain black clothing with no markings readily identifying him as a security guard, armed with a gun,\u201d the state police Public Integrity Task Force said.\n\n\u201cAccording to witness statements, the Midlothian Officer gave the armed subject multiple verbal commands to drop the gun and get on the ground before ultimately discharging his weapon and striking the subject,\u201d state police said in a statement late Tuesday.\n\nGregory Kulis, an attorney representing Roberson\u2019s mother, said Roberson wore a hat emblazoned with the word \u201cSECURITY.\"\n\n\u201cEverybody was screaming out he was a security guard,\" witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV. \"And they basically saw a black man with a gun and killed him.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have not released the name of the officer, who is white.\n\nMidlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said the officer joined the department nearly four years ago after working for another law enforcement agency. The officer was a team leader for a regional SWAT team assembled by police departments in Chicago's south suburbs.\n\n\"We view this as the equivalent of a 'blue on blue,' friendly fire incident,\" Delaney said.\n\nIn an initial statement on the incident, Delaney referred to Roberson as \"a subject with a gun.\" He later praised Roberson.\n\n\u201cThe Midlothian Police Department is completely saddened by this tragic incident, and we give our heartfelt condolences to Jemel, his family and his friends,\" he said. \"There are no words that can be expressed as to the sorrow his family is dealing with.\u201d\n\nMore: Police chief praises security guard killed by cop: 'Jemel Roberson was a brave man'\n\nMore: Police officer near Chicago fatally shot security guard who was detaining a suspect\n\nThe preliminary investigation found that the incident started around 4 a.m. Sunday when an armed person entered the lounge and fired, striking multiple people.\n\nThe suspect suffered non-life-threatening wounds and was hospitalized. He has not been charged.\n\nThe Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office is investigating the shooting inside the bar.\n\nIllinois State Police Sgt. Jacqueline Cepeda said there is no timeline for completing the investigation of the police shooting. She declined to say whether the officer wore a body camera or if the incident was captured by any other video surveillance.\n\nCepeda said the task force will present its findings to the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office prosecution bureau, which will determine whether the shooting was legally justified or if charges against the officer are merited.\n\nState police asked any witnesses who saw the officer shoot Roberson or have knowledge about what happened inside the bar to come forward.\n\nBeatrice Roberson, the security guard's mother, filed a federal lawsuit against Midlothian and the officer \u2013 identified only as John Doe \u2013 seeking more than $1 million in damages.\n\nShe called the officer\u2019s action \u201cunprovoked\u201d and an \u201cexcessive and unreasonable\u201d use of force.\n\nRoberson suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\n\nRobbins is a predominantly black community of about 5,500 residents south of Chicago.

(Photo: Chris Carlson, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Some have suggested that a \"blue wave\" never actually materialized on Election Day, but for California Republicans, it was very real and very rough.\n\nAt least four incumbent Republican House members were swept away in California by last week's election and two more are still at risk as votes continue to be counted.\n\nDemocrat Katie Porter jumped ahead by 261 votes over two-term Rep. Mimi Walters in Orange County, which had been considered a Republican stronghold in a state where Democrats hold a 3.7 million voter advantage in registration. Another Orange County Republican, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, was defeated in his re-election bid for a 16th term, and the seat held by retiring GOP Rep. Darrell Issa also flipped.\n\nAnd Democrats still have hopes of sweeping all four Republican Orange County seats. Republican Young Kim's razor-thin lead over Democrat Gil Cisneros in the state's 39th Congressional District has narrowed to just 711 votes.\n\nFact check: President Trump, GOP making false claims of election fraud\n\nMore: Midterms offer clues about Trump's chances in 'blue wall' states in 2020\n\nIn the state's farm belt, first-time candidate Josh Harder, a 32-year-old venture capitalist, was declared the winner in his race against four-term Republican Rep. Jeff Denham, 51. Harder made Denham's vote against the Affordable Care Act a focus of his campaign and vowed to fight for universal health care.\n\nDenham held a slight lead on Election Day, but Harder overtook the incumbent as the vote count continued and eventually widened his lead to an insurmountable 4,919 votes.\n\nIt was an expensive contest. Harder raised more than $6.5 million to Denham's $4.5 million. And at least 26 outside groups spent another $10 million trying to influence the race, according to California Target Book, which analyzes campaigns.\n\nAnother Republican incumbent from California to give up his seat was Rep. Steve Knight, who lost by nearly 10,000 votes to Democratic challenger Katie Hill in a district north of Los Angeles.\n\nWith Harder's win, Democrats now hold at least 43 of California's 53 seats in the U.S. House.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nFlorida recount: Bill Nelson sues for extension; Chuck Schumer calls for Rick Scott recusal\n\nGeorgia: Federal judge orders review of all provisional ballots , delays deadline for certification\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/14/democratic-gains-california-midterm-elections/1998089002/", "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 General manager Jim Rutherford is sticking with the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nThe team announced Wednesday it has extended Rutherford's contract through the 2021-22 season. His old deal was set to expire at the end of this season.\n\nThe 69-year-old Rutherford is the only general manager to win Stanley Cups with multiple teams since the league expanded in 1967. He put together the Carolina Hurricanes group that won the franchise's only Cup in 2006 and helped the Penguins become the first team in nearly 20 years to win consecutive championships when Pittsburgh won it all in 2016 and 2017.\n\nPenguins co-owners Mario Lemieux and Ron Burkle called Rutherford \"one of the best general managers in all of sports.\"\n\nThe Penguins have won 234 regular-season and playoff games since Rutherford arrived in the summer of 2014.

USA TODAY\n\nA search and rescue worker looks through a car for human remains at a trailer park burned out from the Camp Fire on Nov. 13, 2018, in Paradise, Calif. (Photo: John Locher, AP)\n\nThe death toll of the deadliest wildfire in California history rose to 56 on Wednesday \u2013 and more bodies might be discovered by evacuees returning home, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea warned.\n\nThe number of structures destroyed also went up to 10,321 \u2014 of which 8,650 are single-family homes \u2014 and the Camp Fire's size grew to 215 square miles. It is at 35 percent containment, fire officials said at a press conference.\n\nThe blaze that broke out the morning of Nov. 8 has forced the evacuation of 52,000 people, of whom 1,385 are still in shelters. Another 130 people remain unaccounted for.\n\n\"If you see anyone on the list who is no longer missing, please contact us so their name can be removed,\" Honea said.\n\nHonea said the deliberate search through the rubble of the Camp Fire, 90 miles north of Sacramento, is continuing. But he acknowledged that the \"very, very difficult task\" of searching for remains could mean that when residents return to their charred homes they could discover remains themselves amid the carnage.\n\n\"I know that's a very difficult thing to think about,\" Honea said, noting that anyone who discovers a fire victim should immediately notify his office.\n\nCooler weather and a respite from the wind, however, was slowing the fire's growth, Cal Fire said.\n\nMore: How do wildfires start? All it takes is a spark\n\nMore: 'Unprecedented' Camp Fire's death toll rises again, to 48\n\nEncouraging news on Woolsey Fire\n\nFive-hundred miles to the south, the Woolsey Fire burning west of Los Angeles was blamed for a third death on Wednesday. The fire has burned 153 square miles and destroyed more than 450 homes and businesses, Cal Fire said.\n\nChief Daryl Osby of Los Angeles County Fire Department said firefighters were making progress against the Woolsey Fire, listed as 52 percent contained. This despite Santa Ana winds that buffeted the area with gusts of up to 45 mph and a forecast calling for no rain until at least the end of next week. \u201c(We\u2019re) getting the upper hand here. \u2026There is a lot of confidence as it relates to the containment and control of this fire. We\u2019re feeling better. Our containment percentages have increased,\u201d Osby said.\n\nCause of Camp Fire under investigation\n\nCal Fire was keeping people out of the area where the fire began while it conducts an investigation into the cause of the blaze. Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey also locked down the area where the fire started protected for a possible criminal investigation. A PG&E spokesman on Tuesday declined to say whether work on the power lines had anything to do with starting the fire. \"The cause of the Camp Fire has not been determined. Cal Fire is investigating the cause of the fire,\" said Paul Moreno, a PG&E spokesman.\n\nThis is how wildfires start\n\nDeadly wildfires can begin with something as simple as a downed power line, a flat tire or a tossed cigarette butt. Once a fire ignites, the combination of wind, heat, oxygen and fuel (tinder-dry forests, brush, etc.) can cause it to explode in size. In the early history of the Earth, nearly all wildfires were started by lightning strikes. Nowadays, 84 percent of wildfires in the USA are started by people, according to a comprehensive study in 2017 published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nNo pets \u2013 OK, they can stay\n\nThe signs pasted on the windows of the gymnasium at Pierce College in Woodland Hills are clear: \u201cNo Pets.\u201d But, inside, a giant tortoise is ... slowly ... walking ... laps ... around the lobby of Pierce College\u2019s gymnasium. The college canceled classes because of the Woolsey Fire and turned its gym into a Red Cross Emergency Evacuation Center. Many evacuees left their homes in a hurry, and cats and dogs are a fact of life at the shelter. \u201cWhat we know is that people love their animals, and we\u2019re here to help,\u201d said Allison Cardona, deputy director for County of Los Angeles Animal Care and Control.\n\nPink's hubby has warning for looters\n\nCarey Hart, husband of singer Pink, made it clear that he is not afraid to exercise his Second Amendment rights against looters in areas damaged by the Woolsey Fire west of Los Angeles. The former motocross star posted on Instagram a photo of a dozen gun-wielding men standing in front of a sign that reads, \"Looters will be shot on site.\" Hart commented under the picture that he is not one of the masked men, adding \"if you are a looter, think twice if you are heading back into Malibu.\"\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Sandy Hooper, Cydney Henderson, Steve Kiggins\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/14/california-fires-evacuees-might-return-find-bodies-burned-homes/1997876002/", "The payoff for hosting an Olympics is, too often, fool's gold, and cities are getting wise to the IOC's games. (Photo: Kelvin Kuo, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nCall this payback for the International Olympic Committee\u2019s decades of greed and deceit.\n\nOnce a prize that cities on every continent fought over, so blinded were they by the promise of civic and infrastructure improvements, the Olympics are now being recognized for the economy-busting boondoggle they are. Calgary on Tuesday joined Sapporo, Japan; Sion, Switzerland; and Graz, Austria, in saying \u201cthanks, but no thanks\u201d for the right to throw the IOC a lavish party in February 2026, and there\u2019s a good possibility bids in Italy and Stockholm could soon follow.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a 2026 oddity, either. More cities (eight) dropped out of the bidding for the 2022 and 2024 Olympics than stayed in (four). Several others took themselves out of the running before the official process began.\n\nAnd, really, who can blame them? The graft and corruption that was part and parcel of Rio 2016 has worsened Brazil\u2019s economic collapse. Meanwhile, the Olympic park is a graveyard of crumbling venues and the waterways that were supposed to be cleaned up remain cesspools.\n\nThe flame was barely out at the Pyeongchang Games in February when civic leaders suggested they might have to raze some venues because they couldn\u2019t be repurposed and there wasn\u2019t money to pay for the upkeep of empty buildings. Never mind the environmental damage done to build a ski venue that lasted only as long as the Olympics did.\n\nOh, the IOC talks a good game, saying it\u2019s serious about reform so that no city again spends itself into oblivion.\n\n\u201cI can tell you for \u201926, we are ruthless on this: Don\u2019t even consider building a venue if there is not a 50-year legacy plan,\u201d Christophe Dubi, executive director of the Olympic Games, told The Associated Press in September.\n\nBut Tokyo\u2019s preparation for the Summer Games in 2020 reveals the lie in that.\n\nTokyo was supposed to restore economic sanity to the Olympics. By using several venues left from the 1964 Games and keeping its plan compact, organizers initially said it would cost just $7 billion to host the 2020 Olympics.\n\nCompared with the $13 billion the Rio Olympics cost and the whopping $50 billion price tag for Sochi, Tokyo would be a bargain!\n\nThen came the changes. This venue wouldn\u2019t work and this sport had to be moved and this arena had to be built. Now the venues are sprawled across the metropolitan area, some as far as an hour away, and a Japanese government report estimates the tab for Tokyo 2020 will exceed $25 billion.\n\nWith 18 months still to go before the Games begin, who knows how much higher it will climb.\n\n\u201cI think that people had enough of the establishment telling us what to do, what to think,\u201d Sean Chu, a Calgary councilman and fierce opponent of a 2026 bid, told The Calgary Herald on Tuesday night after 56 percent of voters said they did not want the city to bid for the Winter Olympics.\n\n\u201cThey tell you to spend millions, billions, it\u2019s good for you.\u201d\n\nHear that IOC?\n\nYes, it\u2019s bid organizers and civic leaders who dream up these plans so grandiose they make a 5-year-old\u2019s letter to Santa look spartan. But the IOC is supposed to be the adult in the room, and it has shown no interest in reining in these fanciful projects.\n\nWhy should it? The IOC isn\u2019t the one footing the bill. So long as IOC members have five-star hotels to rest their heads, cars to whisk them to venues, Michelin star-quality food in the \u201cIOC family\u201d lounges and per diems that can go as high as $900, they don\u2019t really care about pesky things like budget overruns and taxes on the populace.\n\nMaybe a few see the storm clouds on the horizon. The rest are either so arrogant or oblivious they believe there\u2019s always going to be a city \u2014 or an autocrat \u2014 willing to take their sucker bet.\n\nBut the payoff for hosting an Olympics is, too often, fool's gold.

But \u201cI love the tragicomedy area. A lot of the stuff I liked doing most was (movies) 'Falling Down' and 'Wonder Boys.' I was always attracted to that area. The chance to do comedy, which is not necessarily what I\u2019m not known for or comes easily to me, was a learning process and a chance to learn more about timing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also his first regular TV role since the 1970s, when Douglas, then 27, was cast opposite Karl Malden on ABC's \u201cThe Streets of San Francisco.\u201d\n\nThe eight-episode first season, out Friday, reveals Sandy as \u201can extremely successful acting teacher, but the other parts of his life are not quite as successful,\u201d Douglas says.

USA TODAY\n\nKit Harington as Jon Snow in a scene from Season 7 of HBO's \"Game of Thrones.\" (Photo: Macall B. Polay/ HBO)\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" fans have a long five months to wait until April 2019, when the eighth and final season is set to premiere, but David Nutter, a longtime director for the show, is helping to tide them over just a little bit.\n\nNutter answered fan questions about the eighth season of HBO's fantasy epic on on Tuesday, in an \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit. The director gave away as much info as he possible could about the finale without spoiling anything.\n\nHere are the biggest things we learned about Season 8.\n\nSeason 8 only has six episodes, but don't expect it to be short\n\nThe \"Thrones\" filmmakers have been saying practically since Season 7 began that Season 8's episodes would be long, and Nutter tacitly confirmed that. \"Season 8 episodes will all I think be longer than 60 minutes,\" he said. \"They\u2019ll be dancing around the bigger numbers, I know that for sure.\"\n\nThe Red Wedding has nothing on Season 8, apparently\n\nNutter directed the infamous Season 3 episode \"The Rains of Castemere,\" which contained the Red Wedding. When a fan asked how the new season would compare to that iconic moment from the series, Nutter replied, \"As far as Season 8 compared to the Red Wedding I just have to tell you - hang onto your seat cause it\u2019s going to be special.\"\n\nThe creators and actors took their time with the final season\n\nNutter underscored how much pressure there was to get the finale of the show right, and how much work everyone put in to the final season.\n\n\"There was not a second chance to get all of these sequences right, and a lot of sequences had many actors in them and some wonderfully intimate scenes as well,\" he said. \"So really it was about taking these characters from point A to B to C to D to E in the various episodes that I did, and making sure that it all balances out properly. We had a lot of rehearsal time and that was really the thing that saved me more than anything else. I'm very happy with the chance to get in there and rehearse with the actors, and I think they were too, and I think it turned out quite well.\"\n\nAnd when asked about why there was such a long break between Seasons 7 and 8, Nutter explained that it was due to the series' complex digital effects. \"Things take time my friends \u2014 they take a lot of time to create and GoT is the last place you\u2019re going to find half baked work so it\u2019s all about making sure they fill the frame with as much capacity as possible and making it as real and right as possible. Small price to pay for the amazing quality that comes out of that show,\" he said.\n\nMore: This is when the final season of 'Game of Thrones' will premiere\n\nThere will be at least one direwolf in Season 8\n\nA fan asked Nutter if there will be direwolves in Season 8, the huge wolf companions of the Stark family, citing fan displeasure with not seeing Jon Snow's (Kit Harington) direwolf in Season 7 too much. Nutter replied, \"Well, I have to say that you will see a direwolf in Season 8. That's all I can say.\"\n\nHe's happy with how things turn out\n\nWhen asked to describe the final season in three words, Nutter had this to offer: \"Season 8 in three words \u2014 Spectacular, Inspiring, Satisfying.\"\n\nHopefully the season is as inspiring to fans as it is to the director.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/14/game-thrones-season-8-director-david-nutter-drops-hints/1998318002/", "CLOSE Matthew Whitaker was previous Jeff Sessions' chief of staff. Sessions submitted his resignation on Wednesday, one day after the 2018 midterm elections. USA TODAY\n\nMatthew Whitaker has been critical of Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Justice Department defended President Donald Trump's appointment of acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, asserting Wednesday that his senior executive status at the department \u201cunquestionably\u201d authorized him to serve despite his lack of Senate confirmation.\n\nThe 20-page opinion issued by Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel based its findings on provisions of the Vacancies Reform Act, which allows for the appointment of a senior staffer who had been in office for at least 90 days. Before his appointment, Whitaker served as chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was fired Nov. 7.\n\nThe opinion was released after Whitaker\u2019s appointment was attacked by Democrats and some Republicans who argued that even an interim replacement for Sessions requires Senate confirmation.\n\nTwo Republican former U.S. attorneys general \u2013 Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales \u2014 questioned the propriety of the appointment because Whitaker hadn't served in a Senate-confirmed position.\n\nAlthough Justice\u2019s own line of succession provides for the deputy attorney general or other confirmed officials to serve as acting attorney general in the event of a vacancy, the Justice opinion argued that the internal provision for succession \u201cdoes not displace the president\u2019s authority to use the Vacancies Reform Act as an alternative.\u201d\n\nThe opinion said Whitaker\u2019s designation was in keeping with the Constitution, which requires the president to obtain Senate approval before appointing \u201cprincipal\u201d officers.\n\n\u201cAlthough an attorney general is a principal officer requiring Senate confirmation, someone who temporarily performs his duties is not,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cAs all three branches of government have long recognized, the president may designate an acting official to perform the duties of vacant principal office, including a Cabinet office, even when the acting official has not been confirmed by the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe last time an acting attorney general served without Senate confirmation was in 1866, when Assistant Attorney General J. Hubley Ashton served for six days after the resignation of Attorney General James Speed, according to the report.\n\nThe opinion said presidential authority to make such designations dated to the early years of the government, citing 160 appointments before 1860 in which \u201cnon-Senate-confirmed persons performed, on a temporary basis,\u201d the duties of secretaries of state, treasury, war, Navy, interior and postmaster general.\n\n\u201cMr. Whitaker\u2019s designation is no more constitutionally problematic than countless similar presidential orders dating back over 200 years,\u201d the opinion said.\n\nDemocrats contended that Whitaker, even if he is permitted to serve, should be recused from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Whitaker was sharply critical of the inquiry and suggested it could be defunded before he joined the department a year ago.\n\nThe Justice opinion did not address any issues related to recusal or whether Whitaker\u2019s authority is limited in any way.\n\nLawmakers criticized Whitaker's appointment and sought to protect Mueller.\n\nFour House Democrats who are likely to lead committees when the new Congress convenes in January announced Wednesday they would investigate Whitaker's involvement with World Patent Marketing, a company that allegedly bilked customers of millions of dollars. Whitaker served on the company's advisory board.\n\nThe lawmakers \u2013 Elijah Cummings of Maryland on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jerrold Nadler of New York on the Judiciary Committee, Frank Pallone of New Jersey on the Energy and Commerce Committee and Adam Schiff of California on the Intelligence Committee \u2013 said \"serious questions are now arising about his fitness to serve in this position of trust\" after the lack of Senate confirmation.\n\nSen. Christopher Coons, D-Del., said on MSNBC Tuesday, \"Whitaker strikes me as a clear and present danger to the independence of the special counsel.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., urged the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on Whitaker \"to ensure that he will take no action to restrict or otherwise interfere\" with Mueller's work.\n\nSen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he would ask Wednesday for a Senate vote on legislation that would prevent firing Mueller.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already expressed hostility toward the Mueller investigation,\" Flake said. \"I think that\u2019s a pretty good reason.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Wednesday that Mueller's investigation is in \"no danger\" and Whitaker's appointment makes no difference.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any legislation is necessary,\" McConnell said. \"We know how the president feels about the Mueller investigation, but he\u2019s never said he wants to shut it down.\"\n\nContributing: Eliza Collins and Cat Hofacker\n\nMore: What has acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker said about the Mueller investigation?\n\nMore: Maryland files federal court challenge asking judge to block Whitaker, install Rosenstein\n\nMore: Two Republican former AGs raise questions on Trump's naming Matthew Whitaker to lead Justice Department\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/14/matthew-whitaker-authorized-department-justice-acting-attorney-general/1997460002/", "This is a view of Shibuya Crossing, one of the busiest crosswalks in the world, in Tokyo.

It produces the top television ratings across the country each year, has prime-time shows for things like schedule releases and fans come out in droves annually to see the future of the league at the draft.\n\nWhat football isn\u2019t, however, is the most popular sport in the world \u2013 not American football, at least. Soccer and even the NBA are miles ahead of the NFL in terms of worldwide popularity, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. They\u2019re both international sports with stars coming from all over the world, whereas the NFL typically gets its talent through colleges in the U.S.\n\nThe league isn\u2019t sitting on its hands and allowing other sports to take over the globe, however. It\u2019s taking a proactive approach by hosting a handful of games internationally each year. The three games in London last month went off without much of a hitch \u2013 Raiders-Seahawks was moved from the new Tottenham Stadium to Wembley Stadium in August \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t the case in Mexico City.\n\nAs announced Tuesday, the NFL is moving Monday night\u2019s showdown between the league-leading Rams and Chiefs from Estadio Azteca to the L.A. Memorial Coliseum because of terrible field conditions \u2013 the right decision, of course. Players threatened to sit out the game if it remained in Mexico City, essentially forcing the NFL\u2019s hand and leading to the relocation.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of revenue coming in each year for the league, but this will cost it a boatload of money, as well as plenty of embarrassment. This is a massive blunder for the NFL and Mexico City, regardless of which side is to blame.\n\nNFL moving on the game from Mexico to LA will cost the league tens of millions of dollars. It will cost Mexico even more if the unhinging of this game unlocks language in 2019, 2020 and 2021 game contract to allow the NFL to cancel future dates of games in country. \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) November 13, 2018\n\nThe financial implications of this gaffe are troubling, but that\u2019s hardly the biggest issue coming out of this situation. The NFL had a golden opportunity with the 9-1 Rams and 9-1 Chiefs \u2013 a potential Super Bowl preview \u2013 playing on international soil.\n\nFans outside the U.S. have hardly been treated to exciting games. All five international games last year were decided by at least 17 points with an average margin of victory of 26.4 points. This year, the Seahawks beat the Raiders in London 27-3 before the Titans-Chargers and Eagles-Jaguars games were one-possession games.\n\nThis Rams-Chiefs matchup had the potential to be special. It comes with the largest over-under total in the history of the NFL at 63.5 with both teams averaging more than 33 points per game. It had the makings of a colossal win for the NFL when it comes to international games.\n\nInstead, the league has some decisions to make and reevaluating to do about future games outside the U.S., including the possibility of playing a game in China next year.\n\nThere\u2019s another game scheduled for Mexico City in 2019 and the deal to keep games there runs through 2021. Will this incident have any impact on that agreement? Maybe not, but Darren Rovell\u2019s above tweet seems to suggest it could.\n\nAfter all, the league has been talking about moving a team to either London or Mexico City. In no way does this stadium debacle help that case and it could create some pushback from players or other members of the organization.\n\nMany players and coaches already dread playing internationally because of the scheduling conflicts it creates, so it\u2019s not as if this will do anything to help those feelings.\n\nPredicting this situation was difficult for the league, but the warning signs were there. A Shakira concert on Oct. 11 left the field in poor condition, but that was hardly the only reason for this game being moved, as some are saying on Twitter.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the field after that event:\n\nLa cancha del Estadio Azteca luego del doble concierto de Shakira durante la Fecha FIFA. Si ya estaba en malas condiciones, la dejaron peor. El pasto h\u00edbrido ha sido un verdadero fiasco y el s\u00e1bado hay partido. \u00bfEstar\u00e1 lista para la Liguilla? \ud83e\udd14 \ud83d\udcf8 @Migue_luk pic.twitter.com/0Vv3ePcW4k \u2014 SoyReferee (@SoyReferee) October 16, 2018\n\nA concert for Telehit, a Mexican TV network, on Nov. 7 \u2013 just 12 days before Chiefs-Rams \u2013 did even greater damage to the playing surface.\n\nTake a look at the field after that show.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo lo ven? \ud83e\udd14 As\u00ed luce la cancha del Estadio Azteca despu\u00e9s de albergar otro concierto \ud83d\ude28 Y ma\u00f1ana tendremos el Cruz Azul vs Lobos BUAP \ud83d\ude30 \ud83d\udcf8 | @Migue_luk pic.twitter.com/hMszGIhUHL \u2014 DIARIO R\u00c9CORD (@record_mexico) November 9, 2018\n\nThen, to make matters even worse, a soccer match was played at Estadio Azteca on Nov. 10, which prevented the grounds crew from doing the necessary work to get the field up to standards. Even without that game it would\u2019ve been difficult, but that extra delay did nothing to help.\n\nThe league should have seen this schedule and raised a few flags. A surprisingly rainy season in the area was obviously impossible to account for, but those two concerts in succession made for a difficult ask \u2013 one the crew in Mexico City couldn\u2019t fulfill.\n\nLet this be a warning sign for the NFL when it comes to international games. It was a golden opportunity to bring a marquee game to foreign soil, but the league and the city fell flat on its face. While expanding the game around the world is a big priority \u2013 and for good reason \u2013 it does come with some risks, as we all saw this week.", "Trump tried to broker House leadership deal, promote loyalist Jim Jordan, report says\n\nCLOSE Incoming House members of the 116th Congress came together outside the US Capitol for their class photo.

According to multiple sources, Green then went on to make it clear he\u2019s been making plays for years. He reminded Durant the Warriors were winning before Durant showed up so he wouldn\u2019t stand for Durant talking to him as if he were a scrub. Green accused Durant of making the whole season about him even though he was going to leave after this season.

He was ready to transition from winning championships to helping others. It never crossed his mind he could still be an athlete after college.\n\nHe was in the Crimson Tide\u2019s weight room when he found out Hendrick Motorsports had reached out to the reigning national champions\u2019 coaching staff, looking for athletes who worked hard but weren\u2019t headed for the NFL. The powerhouse NASCAR team wanted Harrell to come to their pit crew camp and try out.\n\nBut he had already shed his athlete mentality, and he didn\u2019t want to move to North Carolina and be that far from home. Plus, he was worried about not being a mechanic.\n\n\u201cI could change your brakes or your oil, but that\u2019s about it, and they said that\u2019s what they want,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care if you know anything about cars or racing.\u201d\n\nSo he reconsidered and joined HMS for a two-day tryout. To his surprise, he was physically tested like on the football field, only this time he was running with tires and jacks in his hands. Afterward, his body was sore in places that had never been sore before, and he realized this was an opportunity to remain a competitive athlete \u2014 a professional athlete \u2014 when he thought that part of his life was over.\n\n\u201cOnce I got up here and it all set in that, man, I\u2019m about to go compete for more championships, that\u2019s all I could ever ask for,\u201d said Harrell, who eventually became the tire carrier on the No. 88 Chevrolet for Dale Earnhardt Jr, and now Alex Bowman. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\n\nHarrell\u2019s story of transitioning to NASCAR pit crew member is a common one because for the last two decades, racing teams have been recruiting former college athletes \u2014 from football and baseball players to wrestlers \u2014 to work on their cars.\n\nIt\u2019s true that in the beginning, the teams don\u2019t care how much these athletes know about tuning up cars or even about NASCAR itself. They want an athletic and competitive mindset to match that of the drivers, and they\u2019ll teach them to run with and change tires.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the approach.\n\nIt used to be the best mechanics on each team were the ones on pit road, explained Andy Papathanassiou, HMS\u2019 director of human performance. It always made sense for the people who understood every inch of the car to be the ones adjusting it and changing tires during races.\n\nWhile working for HMS on Jeff Gordon\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet team in the mid-1990s, Papathanassiou implemented what he describes as an over-the-wall philosophy, referencing the physical wall pit crew members climb over during a stop. Inspired by athletes, the strategy focuses on racing team members specializing on one job \u2014 or one position \u2014 like other professional athletes do to raise their collective level of performance.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a person that builds and maintains a race car and it\u2019s amazing the skills you have, it might not be the best use of your shop time to sit in front of a wheel and pull it off and put it on 20 times,\u201d said Papathanassiou, who played football at Stanford in the late \u201880s before HMS hired him in 1992 as a pit crew coach.\n\n\u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to get that process a tenth of a second faster, that\u2019s exactly what you need to do. And that\u2019s something that is very familiar in the athletic world \u2014 the practice and repetition down to the very minute details of whatever you\u2019re trying to improve in.\u201d\n\nThe @AxaltaRacing pit crew is getting warmed up for today\u2019s race! pic.twitter.com/r12v4twt0G \u2014 No. 88 Team (@Hendrick88Team) November 4, 2018\n\nGordon\u2019s team was the prototype in Papathanassiou\u2019s experiment, which led to consistently faster pit stops compared with the rest of the field. Aside from the future Hall of Fame driver\u2019s talent, something was clicking with the 24 team, which first led to the Cup Series championship in 1995, and then again in \u201897, \u201898 and 2001. Competing on the same track for more than 30 weekends a year, other teams caught on to the strategy \u2014 which HMS also implemented with all its cars \u2014 and began to recruit athletes for their own pit crews. It was a major paradigm shift in NASCAR that Papathanassiou is credited with initiating.\n\nTwenty years later, the pit departments for NASCAR\u2019s larger teams \u2014 like HMS, Joe Gibbs Racing, Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing \u2014 resemble universities\u2019 athletic departments. On top of pit crew and position coaches, teams have personal trainers, physical therapists, nutritionists, sports psychologists and sometimes orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors who work with the pit crews.\n\nAnd with so many resources and opportunities to offer, recruiting college athletes and convincing them to change sports isn\u2019t that hard of a sell. Pit crew coaches reach out to football, baseball, wrestling and hockey programs looking for dedicated, team players who aren\u2019t going pro, and then they make their pitch. Once pit crew members work their way up to full-time in the Cup Series, they can make between $80,000 and $200,000 a year, Phil Horton, the pit crew coach for Rev Racing and NASCAR\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, told The New York Times earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to allow you to reach your dream of being a professional athlete,\u201d Papathanassiou said. \u201cYou\u2019re athletically gifted, you think in that mindset. If we just apply it in the NASCAR world, it will make you valuable and successful as a professional athlete.\n\n\u201cAnd give them all the credit, they have to reinvent themselves. You play football your whole life, and now you have to risk all that to try and make it in the NASCAR world.\u201d\n\nWith a change in NASCAR\u2019s rules implemented in the beginning of the 2018 season, the number of pit crew members allowed over the wall during a stop dropped from six to five. In years prior, there was a fueler, a jackman, two tire carriers and two tire changers. With five crew members now, the fueler is only allowed to put gas in the car and can\u2019t take on any other pit-stop duties, while jacking up the car and carrying and changing tires is handled by the other four members with someone doubling up.\n\nIf it still seems like these are jobs for mechanics, a number of skills transfer from other sports, aside from the athletic mentality and knowing what it takes to train at an elite level. The little things \u2014 like agility, fast footwork, lightning reflexes, spatial awareness, peripheral vision and operating under pressure \u2014 are the most valuable, said Kellen Mills, who was the gasman for for Joey Logano and the No. 22 Ford team from 2014 through part of the 2018 season. He was also a defensive end for Arizona State from 2003 to 2007.\n\n\u201cTo the athletic side, you\u2019re doing something you\u2019ve never really done before, so you\u2019re learning a new skill,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long learning curve to really becoming proficient.\u201d\n\nWhile many pit crew members are former college \u2014 and sometimes high school \u2014 athletes, not all of them are. But multiple team members and coaches said the number of former college athletes on their rosters continues growing.\n\nTo remain competitive with the rest of the field, there\u2019s a minimum physical ability pit crews have to possess, especially for smaller teams trying to keep up with those with more resources, said Mike Metcalf, the pit crew trainer for Chip Ganassi Racing and fueler for Kyle Larson\u2019s No. 42 Chevrolet. Metcalf \u2014 who was a running back at Appalachian State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 seasons \u2014 described his role on the two-car team as a player-coach.\n\n\u201cI need the runaround speeds to be under four seconds for a jackman, so as long as you can do that, you don\u2019t have to be an athlete,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cBut athletes tend to be able to do that quicker.\u201d\n\nLarger athletes, like former linemen or linebackers, are usually better suited to be tire carriers, jackmen and fuelers. Moving rapidly or even running into the pit box requires strength and balance because the tires weigh between 55 and 75 pounds, while the jack is about 35 pounds and the gascan holds 12 gallons, weighing about 95 pounds when full.\n\nFor many of the former football players, modifying their in-competition mindset was one of the biggest challenges, aside from learning how to make adjustments to a car in 12 to 15 seconds.\n\n\u201cYou come from football where you have to go out there and hit another guy in the mouth, and you have to make sure you\u2019re angry all the time and get yourself hyped up,\u201d said John Gianninoto, the fueler for Chase Elliott\u2019s No. 9 Chevrolet who played center for UNLV from 2007 to 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found in this sport, if you do decide to get really amped up before a pit stop, you actually make more mistakes. So you have to stay even-keeled and just let your body takeover with muscle memory.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of the pit crew, the tire changers are typically agile athletes who are flexible and good with their hands, such as wide receivers, baseball infielders or pitchers, like Calvin Teague, who was a reliever for Appalachian State in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons and is now the rear tire changer on Jimmie Johnson\u2019s No. 48 Chevrolet.\n\nComing from a highly individual role, like pitching, or for those from individual sports, like wrestling, the mentality actually transfers over almost seamlessly, said Teague, who joined the 48 team in 2010, helping Johnson win three of his record-tying seven Cup Series championships. He explained that his pitcher\u2019s disposition is something he references the most on pit road.\n\n\u201cIf I get on the mound and throw a pitch right down the middle and the guy hits a home run, I have to turn right back around within seconds and pitch to a different batter,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this, if I make a mistake, I have to turn right back around because Jimmie\u2019s going to come back. You\u2019re dealing with tenths of seconds and trying to go as fast as you can.\u201d\n\nDespite the perception that NASCAR is an individual sport because the driver receives a lopsided amount of attention compared with the pit crew, the team element is part of the competition former college athletes are all too familiar with. They know how to push each other in practice, galvanize each other on pit road and encourage the newcomers who are just beginning to reinvent themselves in a new sport. The veterans know exactly what that\u2019s like.\n\nWith little room for error, the time for a strong pit stop has shifted to about 12 seconds, up from 10, following NASCAR\u2019s rule change about the number of crew members allowed over the wall.\n\nAnd, as Papathanassiou said, pit stop times are tracking the slowest position\u2019s time, and the difference between a fast stop and the fastest stop can determine who wins the race \u2013 and, subsequently, who qualifies for or advances through the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our best performer that sets our level of performance for the day; it\u2019s actually our weakest link,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a different mentality versus other sports, where you can really go after things harder and rely on key people to bring everyone else along. We\u2019re successful in the complete opposite way.\u201d\n\nCountless people work on the cars throughout the week and in the offseason at the teams\u2019 shops, which are mostly in North Carolina. But on race day, they function like a football team with the driver leading on the track, the crew chief calling the shots and the pit crew making fast and small adjustments to pick up tenths of a second and get off pit road the fastest.\n\nLike on Sunday at the Cup Series finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, when a championship or race is won, the pit crew celebrates with the driver in Victory Lane. They\u2019re still soaked in champagne \u2014 or Gatorade, Miller Lite, Mountain Dew or whatever the team sponsor\u2019s chosen beverage is \u2014 and in most of the glory photos. The driver is always the center of attention \u2014 though he routinely thanks his team and pit crew for their work \u2014 but for many of these former college athletes, it\u2019s nothing new.\n\n\u201cThink about being an offensive lineman,\u201d said Landon Walker, the fueler for William Byron\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet team who was an offensive tackle at Clemson from 2008 to 2011. \u201cIf you have a good weekend, usually the running backs or quarterbacks are the ones in the paper.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to that, and I think you develop your character around being an unsung hero because I love it. I don\u2019t really need praise because at the end of the day, we know we\u2019re out here doing our job, and we\u2019re part of the team no matter what.\u201d", "", "", "", "Nab Duchess Meghan-inspired wedding dress from Stella McCartney's new bridal collection\n\nThis could all be yours... well, minus the prince and the car and the ring, but the dress \u2013 a replica of the dress could be yours!

USA TODAY\n\nThe DVR has always been a tool to record TV shows and play them back, to watch on the television. Amazon changes that.\n\nIts Fire TV Recast DVR, out Nov. 14, will re-imagine how you think of a DVR. Yes, it can record TV shows, but only if connected to an antenna. Reader alert: Cable and satellite customers will find the Recast useless. It's for cord-cutters only.\n\nOnce connected, the Recast acts as the TV hub that receives the signal and re-distributes it, along with the recorded shows, to multiple TV sets, your phone and tablet.\n\nStarting at $229, the Recast is about the lowest-priced, full-service DVR that's been available to date, and highlighted by one magic consumer advantage \u2013 no monthly fee. Most cable services charge a monthly rental for their DVRs to the tune of $30 or so, and rival TiVo has a host of DVRs available, with monthly fees of anywhere from $6.99 to $15.\n\nAmazon makes cutting the cord more attractive with their new Amazon Fire TV Recast. It is a DVR for over-the-air television. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USAT)\n\nSo what is it?\n\nThe Recast works only with Amazon products. There's the Fire TV Edition of television sets, which start at around $229.Though, many retailers will discount them to just over $100 with Black Friday deals. You could also use an Amazon Fire TV Stick ($30-$50) streaming device in any TV with an HDMI port or the Echo Show, the $229 edition of the talking speaker that brings video to Alexa. Additionally, you'll need to add an antenna at a cost of $30 or more.\n\nBeyond having a tool to record local news and sports and broadcast shows (most of which are readily available via apps), the twist is that the Recast has Alexa built in, so you just say, \"Alexa, record 'The Price is Right',\" or \"...Tune to NBC.\"\n\nAgain, the Recast isn't just a DVR, but a box that has taken over your TV set. You use it to find out what's on, to turn to a specific station, view the channel guide, record, and monitor your recorded shows. (Second reader alert: During setup, you plug the antenna into the Recast and not a TV.)\n\nIf you use a Fire Stick in multiple TVs throughout your home, you can tap into shows recorded on the Recast, wherever it actually sits, and even watch live TV, via a DVR tab that shows up in the Amazon TV menu.\n\nFor cord cutters, other choices of devices to record and playback TV shows are slim. There's the new TiVo, the Bolt OTA, which sells for $249.99 plus $6.99 monthly, or the Tablo, which has several models available, selling for $139 to $199. But you'll need to spring for a hard drive to connect to it, so add $75 to $100. Like the Recast, Tablo and the Bolt connect only to antennas, not cable or satellite boxes.\n\nSo how is the Recast?\n\nFirst, props to Amazon for re-imagining how we watch TV.\n\nThat said, setup can take some time (remember, antenna into the unit, not the TV), and it's different experience that may take getting used to.\n\nOnce it's up and running, it records and finds shows, although not as smoothly as with the cable DVR, which to my eyes does a more pleasing job of zipping through commercials visually than the Recast. But then again, I'm paying over $400 yearly for this right in DVR rentals from my cable company. I love paying once with no monthly fees.\n\nOne more caveat: When so much programming is available via streaming, in movies, original TV shows and the like, and when YouTube offers the best of broadcast TV (and so much more in clip form) it's questionable whether any of us actually need to record anything.\n\nBut then, I'm not a fan of \"The Bachelor,\" so what do I know?\n\nAnother note: Because Amazon and Google don't get along, the official YouTube app isn't included in the Amazon offerings. But Amazon has a workaround to pick up YouTube via a browser.\n\nPro: Low price, unique twist on TV viewing, no monthly fee. Starts at $229 with ability to record up to four shows at once on 500 GB hard drive, or $279 for 1 TB hard drive.\n\nCon: Works only with Amazon products, so if you get Amazon Prime Video via the Roku streaming stick, you'd need to spring for Amazon's brand. You're also missing out on the cable alternative YouTube TV, which won't work with Recast. Fast forward not as visually appealing and precise as the cable DVR.\n\nReaders: Would you ditch your cable DVR for a unit that works only with an antenna?

USA TODAY\n\nAmazonBasics Microwave (Photo: Amazon)\n\n\u201cAlexa, microwave 6 ounces of oatmeal.\u201d \u201cAlexa, nuke peas for 30 seconds.\u201d \u201cAlexa reheat one cup of coffee.\u201d\n\nOK, so perhaps Alexa isn\u2019t exactly America\u2019s top chef. But Amazon\u2019s digital assistant does assume the role of a vocally-driven kitchen helper as you reheat a plate, defrost foods and otherwise prepare a meal with the previously announced but just now available AmazonBasics Microwave. I\u2019ve been cooking with it for a couple of days and find the $59.99 price \u2013 and to some degree the use of voice \u2013 appetizing.\n\nAs with any other compact countertop microwave, you can press on a keypad to choose power levels \u2013 there are 10 \u2013 or the length of time you\u2019ll be nuking the item you\u2019ve placed inside.\n\nBut where\u2019s the fun in that when you can get Alexa to do everything at your behest?\n\nAnd to get serious for a second, a voice-controlled, Wi-Fi microwave is not only convenient, but it might benefit those of you who are blind or have low vision.\n\nUsing preset voice instructions\n\nThere\u2019s one key requirement to keep in mind however: You will need to pair the microwave with a nearby Echo speaker, lest you're left with a basic 700-watt microwave that's more or less like any other, with standard features such as turntable, child lock and kitchen timer.\n\nMore: Amazon connects digital assistant Alexa to microwave, clock and car\n\nI paired the microwave with an Echo Show in my tests, and, it's important to note that even when the microwave is in the middle of cooking something, you can still ask Alexa to play music, deliver the weather or handle other queries on your Echo device.\n\nFollowing a relatively simple setup through the Alexa app on my phone \u2013 after plugging the microwave into the wall, I received a notification that it was found \u2013 you can bark commands out loud to the microwave (via the Echo Show) with the familiar Alexa \u201cwake word.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, microwave one corn on the cob,\u201d for instance.\n\nAlternatively, if you\u2019re standing in front of the microwave, you can press a dedicated \u201cAsk Alexa\u201d button before telling it what you want the microwave to do. In that case, you would just say, \u201cone corn on the cob.\u201d\n\nOnce cooking, you can also use your voice to pause or stop the microwave.\n\nAmazon supplies a number of quick cook preset voice instructions, and as I found in my tests, you\u2019ll want to follow those instructions, at least at this point, closely. When I issued the command, \u201cAlexa, reheat my coffee,\u201d the response I got on the Echo Show was, \u201cwhat\u2019s the volume of coffee?\u201d When I followed with \u201cAlexa, reheat one cup of coffee,\u201d the microwave kicked into action.\n\nAmazon explains that the microwave does not have built-in sensors to detect the weight or volume of whatever it is you would want to cook, so when using such presets for liquids, specify the volume (yes, \u201cone cup of coffee\u201d), and when using solids, specify the quantity or weight (\u201c6 ounces of rice\u201d).\n\nNuking a muffin in the AmazonBasics Microwave. (Photo: Edward C. baig)\n\nA snag: During a couple of tries, the microwave failed to comply when I asked, \u201cAlexa to microwave two potatoes,\u201d though you\u2019re supposed to be able to tell it to microwave between one and four potatoes. When I asked Alexa to instead microwave one potato, the machine did as told. (In another attempt, later on, the two-potato command did work).\n\nIn the single potato example, the microwave started cooked for 6\u00bd minutes; as it turned out, I had to extend the time by two minutes before it was to my liking. To be fair, almost every microwave I\u2019ve ever used has some degree of trial and error.\n\nKeeping what you cook private\n\nAmazon says it will learn over time the kind of commands Alexa gets from customers and the foods people attempt to nuke to smarten up Alexa\u2019s instructions for the microwave.\n\nThe company insists that in gathering such data your own preferences will remain anonymous; it promises not to violate your privacy and start sending you ads for soup, say, if you\u2019re constantly looking to heat up soup in the microwave.\n\nYou can order popcorn through Amazon's Dash Replenishment program through the AmazonBasics Microwave. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThat said, there is at least one shopping play in the form of a dedicated popcorn button on the microwave that lets you automatically reorder your supply through Amazon\u2019s Dash Replenishment technology. You must opt into the program. If you do want to order popcorn, you choose the pack size during setup.\n\nAmazon hasn\u2019t announced other products you can order through the Dash program on the microwave, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge leap of faith to expect that more are in the pipeline. Remember, Amazon now owns Whole Foods.\n\nOne other possibility I can envision down the road is a tie-in somehow to an Echo such as the Show that has a screen \u2013 you might see recipes on that display for the microwave.\n\nThe microwave is also Amazon\u2019s first built using Alexa Connect Kit, a pitch to developers to easily build Alexa-connected devices.\n\nFor all the years that microwaves have been around, some are still more complicated than they need to be. Alexa may help some in that regard, though you still may find yourself resorting to old habits and pressing the keypad. There\u2019s not yet an Alexa robot to either place food in the microwave or take it out, so you\u2019re going to more often than not be right in front of the thing anyway.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com ; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2018/11/14/amazon-microwave-review-alexa-nuke-popcorn-heat-up-coffee/1986404002/", "Uber Rewards screen. (Photo: Uber)\n\nIf you use Uber frequently, you'll soon be rewarded for your rides.\n\nThe ride-sharing company is launching a new Uber Rewards program Wednesday that will provide perks to riders for using its service. Available first in nine cities in the U.S. before rolling out to all U.S. riders over the coming months, the program is similar to the company's recently announced rewards program for drivers.\n\nOn the list of initial launch cities: Miami; Denver; Tampa, Florida; New York; Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia; Atlanta; San Diego; and parts of New Jersey.\n\nThe program, which has been in the works for roughly a year, \"started from the premise that Uber today is really different than Uber from 10 years ago or eight years ago,\" says Nundu Janakiram, Uber's director of product for rider experience.\n\n\"What we've found is that Uber is now this thing that people use every day, and we wanted to find a way to reward our customers who choose Uber every day and build a relationship with them.\"\n\nAs with the driver program, Uber's rider rewards will dish out points depending on which Uber service is used, with the points unlocking different levels and the levels opening up perks. Among the notable rewards: discounts on future rides, better customer support and priority pickup at airports.\n\nUberPool and Uber Eats orders will earn you one point per dollar spent while UberX, XL, Select and WAV will get you two points per dollar. Users of the company's luxury Black and Black SUV services will earn three points per dollar spent.\n\nJanakiram says the company will be adding points for using bikes and scooters in the future.\n\nPoints can be earned regardless of whether the rider is using Uber for personal or business or if they are using Uber gift cards, though there is no additional perk for using Uber's Visa credit card.\n\nFour levels, each with different perks\n\nThe points will go toward placing you in one of four tiers \u2013 Blue, Gold, Platinum and Diamond \u2013 that will determine what perks you are eligible for. Blue is the standard level, with every 500 points netting you $5 in Uber Cash, the company's virtual currency that can be used to pay for Uber rides or Uber Eats deliveries. Using Uber Cash also earns you points.\n\nYou will earn $5 for every 500 points you accrue regardless of which tier you are in. Progress can be tracked through the Uber app, which is being updated alongside this launch.\n\nUber Rewards Gold members can have their cancellation fees refunded if they order within 15 minutes of canceling. (Photo: Uber)\n\nAfter your first 500 points are earned, you'll be bumped up to Gold, which will get you faster customer support plus the ability to cancel an Uber ride and get the cancellation fee refunded so long as a new ride is ordered within 15 minutes of canceling. (This does not apply to UberPool or Uber Express Pool orders.)\n\nOnce you accrue 2,500 points, you'll be elevated to Platinum, adding in perks like priority pickup to help lower wait times at \"most airports\" around the country, though Uber says this may take a couple of months to fully roll out.\n\nYou also will be able to get \"price protection\" on a particular route of your choosing, allowing you to lock in a set rate for an UberX ride. The rate would be for either direction and won't be impacted by surge pricing caused by traffic or if the ride is taken during the busiest times of the day.\n\nUber Rewards allows for price protection on a specific route. (Photo: Uber)\n\nUnlike the company's Ride Pass service, this perk only protects one particular route and not all rides, though you can change it once per month.\n\nAt 7,500 points, you will reach the Diamond level, granting you all the prior perks plus dedicated phone support (something regular Uber users rarely have access to) and an \"UberX Diamond\" option in the app that will pair you with higher rated drivers on your UberX trips.\n\nDiamond members will also receive waived delivery fees on up to three Uber Eats orders every six months and free \"surprise\" upgrades from UberX to Uber Black.\n\nUber will be covering the cost of the difference between X and Black rides and will also be covering the cancellation fees it refunds to ensure drivers still get paid.\n\n\"We consider it an investment from Uber,\" says Janakiram. \"It's not drivers paying for Uber Rewards, it is Uber that's investing in our customers.\"\n\nPoints are accrued during six month periods, with the perks you unlock available for the rest of that period plus the following six months. Points do not roll over from one period to the next.\n\nThere is no cost to sign up for Rewards, though you will need to opt into it. In a bid to get people more aware of the program, Uber is letting users start at a higher tier by counting all of your rides and food orders from the six-month period prior to your signing up.\n\nThe latest battleground with Lyft\n\nRewards are just the latest battleground between Uber and chief rival Lyft, which announced a rewards program of its own earlier this week called Lyft Rewards.\n\nAt this point, however, few details are known about Lyft's program, though it will offer occasional savings on future rides and upgrades to more premium vehicles. Like Uber, Lyft's rewards program will be available in its app.\n\nLyft says that it will be testing the service for \"select riders in various cities\" starting in December before expanding the program in 2019.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/11/14/uber-rewards-gives-ride-discounts-and-other-perks-frequent-riders/1989902002/", "", "Matthew Libatique (Photo: Chris Pizzello, AP)\n\nWARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Officials say an Oscar-nominated American cinematographer has been charged in Poland after he allegedly attacked paramedics and police.\n\nMatthew Libatique, 50, was nominated for an Oscar for his work on the 2010 film \"Black Swan,\" directed by Darren Afonofsky, and was the cinematographer for this year's \"A Star is Born,\" directed by Bradley Cooper and co-starring Lady Gaga.\n\nThe incident occurred Tuesday in Bydgoszcz, where Libatique was an honorary guest at an international film festival.

He was ready to transition from winning championships to helping others. It never crossed his mind he could still be an athlete after college.\n\nHe was in the Crimson Tide\u2019s weight room when he found out Hendrick Motorsports had reached out to the reigning national champions\u2019 coaching staff, looking for athletes who worked hard but weren\u2019t headed for the NFL. The powerhouse NASCAR team wanted Harrell to come to their pit crew camp and try out.\n\nBut he had already shed his athlete mentality, and he didn\u2019t want to move to North Carolina and be that far from home. Plus, he was worried about not being a mechanic.\n\n\u201cI could change your brakes or your oil, but that\u2019s about it, and they said that\u2019s what they want,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cThey don\u2019t care if you know anything about cars or racing.\u201d\n\nSo he reconsidered and joined HMS for a two-day tryout. To his surprise, he was physically tested like on the football field, only this time he was running with tires and jacks in his hands. Afterward, his body was sore in places that had never been sore before, and he realized this was an opportunity to remain a competitive athlete \u2014 a professional athlete \u2014 when he thought that part of his life was over.\n\n\u201cOnce I got up here and it all set in that, man, I\u2019m about to go compete for more championships, that\u2019s all I could ever ask for,\u201d said Harrell, who eventually became the tire carrier on the No. 88 Chevrolet for Dale Earnhardt Jr, and now Alex Bowman. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\n\nHarrell\u2019s story of transitioning to NASCAR pit crew member is a common one because for the last two decades, racing teams have been recruiting former college athletes \u2014 from football and baseball players to wrestlers \u2014 to work on their cars.\n\nIt\u2019s true that in the beginning, the teams don\u2019t care how much these athletes know about tuning up cars or even about NASCAR itself. They want an athletic and competitive mindset to match that of the drivers, and they\u2019ll teach them to run with and change tires.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the approach.\n\nIt used to be the best mechanics on each team were the ones on pit road, explained Andy Papathanassiou, HMS\u2019 director of human performance. It always made sense for the people who understood every inch of the car to be the ones adjusting it and changing tires during races.\n\nWhile working for HMS on Jeff Gordon\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet team in the mid-1990s, Papathanassiou implemented what he describes as an over-the-wall philosophy, referencing the physical wall pit crew members climb over during a stop. Inspired by athletes, the strategy focuses on racing team members specializing on one job \u2014 or one position \u2014 like other professional athletes do to raise their collective level of performance.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a person that builds and maintains a race car and it\u2019s amazing the skills you have, it might not be the best use of your shop time to sit in front of a wheel and pull it off and put it on 20 times,\u201d said Papathanassiou, who played football at Stanford in the late \u201880s before HMS hired him in 1992 as a pit crew coach.\n\n\u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to get that process a tenth of a second faster, that\u2019s exactly what you need to do. And that\u2019s something that is very familiar in the athletic world \u2014 the practice and repetition down to the very minute details of whatever you\u2019re trying to improve in.\u201d\n\nThe @AxaltaRacing pit crew is getting warmed up for today\u2019s race! pic.twitter.com/r12v4twt0G \u2014 No. 88 Team (@Hendrick88Team) November 4, 2018\n\nGordon\u2019s team was the prototype in Papathanassiou\u2019s experiment, which led to consistently faster pit stops compared with the rest of the field. Aside from the future Hall of Fame driver\u2019s talent, something was clicking with the 24 team, which first led to the Cup Series championship in 1995, and then again in \u201897, \u201898 and 2001. Competing on the same track for more than 30 weekends a year, other teams caught on to the strategy \u2014 which HMS also implemented with all its cars \u2014 and began to recruit athletes for their own pit crews. It was a major paradigm shift in NASCAR that Papathanassiou is credited with initiating.\n\nTwenty years later, the pit departments for NASCAR\u2019s larger teams \u2014 like HMS, Joe Gibbs Racing, Team Penske and Stewart-Haas Racing \u2014 resemble universities\u2019 athletic departments. On top of pit crew and position coaches, teams have personal trainers, physical therapists, nutritionists, sports psychologists and sometimes orthopedic surgeons and chiropractors who work with the pit crews.\n\nAnd with so many resources and opportunities to offer, recruiting college athletes and convincing them to change sports isn\u2019t that hard of a sell. Pit crew coaches reach out to football, baseball, wrestling and hockey programs looking for dedicated, team players who aren\u2019t going pro, and then they make their pitch. Once pit crew members work their way up to full-time in the Cup Series, they can make between $80,000 and $200,000 a year, Phil Horton, the pit crew coach for Rev Racing and NASCAR\u2019s Drive for Diversity program, told The New York Times earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to allow you to reach your dream of being a professional athlete,\u201d Papathanassiou said. \u201cYou\u2019re athletically gifted, you think in that mindset. If we just apply it in the NASCAR world, it will make you valuable and successful as a professional athlete.\n\n\u201cAnd give them all the credit, they have to reinvent themselves. You play football your whole life, and now you have to risk all that to try and make it in the NASCAR world.\u201d\n\nWith a change in NASCAR\u2019s rules implemented in the beginning of the 2018 season, the number of pit crew members allowed over the wall during a stop dropped from six to five. In years prior, there was a fueler, a jackman, two tire carriers and two tire changers. With five crew members now, the fueler is only allowed to put gas in the car and can\u2019t take on any other pit-stop duties, while jacking up the car and carrying and changing tires is handled by the other four members with someone doubling up.\n\nIf it still seems like these are jobs for mechanics, a number of skills transfer from other sports, aside from the athletic mentality and knowing what it takes to train at an elite level. The little things \u2014 like agility, fast footwork, lightning reflexes, spatial awareness, peripheral vision and operating under pressure \u2014 are the most valuable, said Kellen Mills, who was the gasman for for Joey Logano and the No. 22 Ford team from 2014 through part of the 2018 season. He was also a defensive end for Arizona State from 2003 to 2007.\n\n\u201cTo the athletic side, you\u2019re doing something you\u2019ve never really done before, so you\u2019re learning a new skill,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThere\u2019s a long learning curve to really becoming proficient.\u201d\n\nWhile many pit crew members are former college \u2014 and sometimes high school \u2014 athletes, not all of them are. But multiple team members and coaches said the number of former college athletes on their rosters continues growing.\n\nTo remain competitive with the rest of the field, there\u2019s a minimum physical ability pit crews have to possess, especially for smaller teams trying to keep up with those with more resources, said Mike Metcalf, the pit crew trainer for Chip Ganassi Racing and fueler for Kyle Larson\u2019s No. 42 Chevrolet. Metcalf \u2014 who was a running back at Appalachian State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 seasons \u2014 described his role on the two-car team as a player-coach.\n\n\u201cI need the runaround speeds to be under four seconds for a jackman, so as long as you can do that, you don\u2019t have to be an athlete,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cBut athletes tend to be able to do that quicker.\u201d\n\nLarger athletes, like former linemen or linebackers, are usually better suited to be tire carriers, jackmen and fuelers. Moving rapidly or even running into the pit box requires strength and balance because the tires weigh between 55 and 75 pounds, while the jack is about 35 pounds and the gascan holds 12 gallons, weighing about 95 pounds when full.\n\nFor many of the former football players, modifying their in-competition mindset was one of the biggest challenges, aside from learning how to make adjustments to a car in 12 to 15 seconds.\n\n\u201cYou come from football where you have to go out there and hit another guy in the mouth, and you have to make sure you\u2019re angry all the time and get yourself hyped up,\u201d said John Gianninoto, the fueler for Chase Elliott\u2019s No. 9 Chevrolet who played center for UNLV from 2007 to 2010.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found in this sport, if you do decide to get really amped up before a pit stop, you actually make more mistakes. So you have to stay even-keeled and just let your body takeover with muscle memory.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of the pit crew, the tire changers are typically agile athletes who are flexible and good with their hands, such as wide receivers, baseball infielders or pitchers, like Calvin Teague, who was a reliever for Appalachian State in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons and is now the rear tire changer on Jimmie Johnson\u2019s No. 48 Chevrolet.\n\nComing from a highly individual role, like pitching, or for those from individual sports, like wrestling, the mentality actually transfers over almost seamlessly, said Teague, who joined the 48 team in 2010, helping Johnson win three of his record-tying seven Cup Series championships. He explained that his pitcher\u2019s disposition is something he references the most on pit road.\n\n\u201cIf I get on the mound and throw a pitch right down the middle and the guy hits a home run, I have to turn right back around within seconds and pitch to a different batter,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this, if I make a mistake, I have to turn right back around because Jimmie\u2019s going to come back. You\u2019re dealing with tenths of seconds and trying to go as fast as you can.\u201d\n\nDespite the perception that NASCAR is an individual sport because the driver receives a lopsided amount of attention compared with the pit crew, the team element is part of the competition former college athletes are all too familiar with. They know how to push each other in practice, galvanize each other on pit road and encourage the newcomers who are just beginning to reinvent themselves in a new sport. The veterans know exactly what that\u2019s like.\n\nWith little room for error, the time for a strong pit stop has shifted to about 12 seconds, up from 10, following NASCAR\u2019s rule change about the number of crew members allowed over the wall.\n\nAnd, as Papathanassiou said, pit stop times are tracking the slowest position\u2019s time, and the difference between a fast stop and the fastest stop can determine who wins the race \u2013 and, subsequently, who qualifies for or advances through the playoffs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our best performer that sets our level of performance for the day; it\u2019s actually our weakest link,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a different mentality versus other sports, where you can really go after things harder and rely on key people to bring everyone else along. We\u2019re successful in the complete opposite way.\u201d\n\nCountless people work on the cars throughout the week and in the offseason at the teams\u2019 shops, which are mostly in North Carolina. But on race day, they function like a football team with the driver leading on the track, the crew chief calling the shots and the pit crew making fast and small adjustments to pick up tenths of a second and get off pit road the fastest.\n\nLike on Sunday at the Cup Series finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, when a championship or race is won, the pit crew celebrates with the driver in Victory Lane. They\u2019re still soaked in champagne \u2014 or Gatorade, Miller Lite, Mountain Dew or whatever the team sponsor\u2019s chosen beverage is \u2014 and in most of the glory photos. The driver is always the center of attention \u2014 though he routinely thanks his team and pit crew for their work \u2014 but for many of these former college athletes, it\u2019s nothing new.\n\n\u201cThink about being an offensive lineman,\u201d said Landon Walker, the fueler for William Byron\u2019s No. 24 Chevrolet team who was an offensive tackle at Clemson from 2008 to 2011. \u201cIf you have a good weekend, usually the running backs or quarterbacks are the ones in the paper.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to that, and I think you develop your character around being an unsung hero because I love it. I don\u2019t really need praise because at the end of the day, we know we\u2019re out here doing our job, and we\u2019re part of the team no matter what.\u201d", "This undated photo provided by the Oakland County Sheriff's Office in Michigan, shows Jeffery Zeigler.

He ran after seeing a man inside the house grab a gun. A key piece of evidence: Video from a home security camera showing the boy running away and a shirtless Zeigler firing a shotgun. Smoke emerged from the barrel.\n\nA jury convicted him last month of assault and a gun crime.\n\n\u201cHe almost took the life of another human being,\u201d assistant prosecutor Kelly Collins said. \u201cThat will forever stay with Brennan \u2014 forever.

(Photo: Dolby)\n\nDolby is a recognizable name at the neighborhood cinema, if not your own home theater.\n\nWhile Dolby Laboratories has licensed its technologies to electronics makers for years, and the landmark Dolby Theater in Hollywood is home to the Academy Awards, the company has never sold its own branded product directly to you or me.\n\nUntil now.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dolby releases its first consumer product, a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones called Dolby Dimension. And unlike most wearable portable speakers, aka headphones, it's designed primarily for use in the house, not on the go.\n\nYour initial thought might match mine: Aren\u2019t the folks at Dolby just a little bit crazy diving into such a congested market? I mean, how many companies make headphones nowadays?\n\nAppealing to affluent binge watchers\n\nAnd there\u2019s this: While Dolby has a reputation for premium audio quality, purchasing these headphones is going to set you back $599.\n\nAre they worth it? You\u2019ll have to decide whether you\u2019ve got the disposable income for this kind of splurge, but what I can say is they sound great and are comfortable to wear. For the money Dolby is asking, they better be.\n\nDolby is targeting affluent early adopters and those of you who spend a lot of time binge streaming \u2014 maybe so much so that you feel guilty you\u2019re isolated from your loved ones.\n\nDolby\u2019s solution is a feature inside Dimension called Dolby LifeMix, which lets you switch between nearly shutting out the outside world through active noise cancellation, or switching to an adjustable \u201ctransparency\u201d mode that lets you hear the telephone, doorbell, or, most importantly, your family, without sacrificing much in the way of audio quality. You can also choose a setting to boost the sounds from your surroundings.\n\nYou can tap the touch control on the right ear cup to toggle back and forth between noise cancellation and transparency mode, or adjust the setting inside the Dimension app on your phone.\n\nWith active noise cancellation turned on, I didn\u2019t hear the FedEx guy ring my doorbell the other day while I was watching Netflix at a loud volume. When I\u2019m home with my family, I chose a more balanced transparency setting so that I can more easily hear them if need be. The headphones have five omnidirectional microphones.\n\nThrough the touch control on the outside of the right ear cup, you can also change the volume or, if paired to an appropriate device, summon Siri or the Google Assistant.\n\nAnd through the app, you can turn on a \u201cvirtualization\u201d feature that is meant to allow you to further immerse yourself in a movie or TV scene, though I didn't get a complete surround-sound like feeling.\n\nThere\u2019s also a \u201chead tracking\u201d feature that is supposed to make the sound seem like it\u2019s coming from your screen, even when you turn your head. I sometimes had difficulty hearing this effect, though the truth is I was typically looking at the screen I was listening to anyway, which I suspect you\u2019d do as well.\n\nDolby has made it easy to switch among three paired Bluetooth devices by pressing one of the three corresponding buttons those devices are mapped to. So I was able to switch from watching on an Apple TV, iPad and my phone without having to re-pair those devices each and every time.\n\nYou can manage up to eight paired Bluetooth devices through the Dimension app, though only three correspond to the buttons on the headphones at any one time.\n\nCharging Dolby Dimension headphones. (Photo: Dolby)\n\nAn expensive feel\n\nDolby Dimension feels like the expensive product it is. The padded ear cups and headband are wrapped in synthetic leather; the curved headband made of stainless steel.\n\nDolby claims up to 10 hours of battery life with the LifeMix and virtualization features turned on or up to 15 hours in a low power mode when those features are turned off.\n\nThe headphones charge in a clever power base with one of the ear cups sitting snug inside a micro-suction foot that won\u2019t stain or leave a ring on your furniture.\n\nIf you mostly use the headphones at home, battery life shouldn\u2019t be a major issue. If you take them on the road, you can charge the headphones via USB, getting, Dolby says, about a two-hour charge after plugging them in for just 15 or 20 minutes.\n\nI like Dolby Dimension very much and found I wanted to use them more than I initially suspected I would. I was able to watch what I wanted to watch without disturbing my kids when they were doing their homework or my wife when she was catching up on work. But when they needed to get my attention they could, without having to yell or tap me.\n\nBut face it, we\u2019re talking about a luxury purchase here. At $599, Dolby\u2019s first consumer product is decidedly not for the masses.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2018/11/14/dolby-dimension-review-headphones-block-out-noise-high-cost/1986443002/", "None\n\nSymphony of the Seas is the fourth vessel in Royal Caribbean's groundbreaking Oasis Class series, which began debuting in 2009.

To counter the effect, architects and builders have come up with non-settling systems that prevent logs from sinking and shrinking.

Clockwise from lower left: BC roll (barbecued salmon skin with vegetables and tobiko), spider roll (fried softshell crab avocado, daikon and cucumber), KFC roll (Japanese fried chicken in rice wrapped in avocado) and a basic spicy tuna roll. (Photo: Larry Olmsted for USA TODAY)\n\nThe scene: Ski season is coming fast, and in the world of skiing, nothing is bigger than Whistler/Blackcomb \u2013 it\u2019s the largest, tallest and most visited resort in North America, hosted the skiing for the Vancouver Olympics, and is a bucket-list destination for skiers and snowboarders worldwide. In summer it has world-class golf and has long been known as one of the top mountain-biking destinations in the world. There is a lot to do here all year round, and Whistler is full of bars and restaurants of every description, but none of them is more famous than the town\u2019s icon, Sushi Village.\n\n\u201cSome people come back every year and eating (at Sushi Village) is a big part of it,\u201d said Marc Riddell, a longtime local and former ski patroller who now works in marketing for the mountain. Sushi Village was just the sixth restaurant in Whistler when it opened in 1985 \u2013 long before the current trendiness of sushi \u2013 and it has thrived ever since. While there are now well over a hundred eateries here, it remains Whistler\u2019s single must-visit destination.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like much, upstairs on the second floor of a retail building in the heart of the pedestrianized village, a block from the base of the slopes, above a snowboard shop. There is usually a line to get in, which can fill the balcony and spill onto the stairs. There\u2019s a hostess stand at the top of the stairs and once you get through the door, a small waiting area near the bar off to one side, which is packed as well.\n\nThe main dining room is an L-shaped restaurant wrapping around a bustling sushi bar, and the bulk of the seating is at tables and booths divided by Japanese-style wooden lattice half-walls. The walls are covered with a mix of skis, snowboards and art by a popular local artist with a colorful science-fiction feel.\n\nSushi Village is as much about drinking as eating, and it is loud, lively and boisterous. It is essentially a cross between a conventional restaurant and an izakaya, or Japanese pub. When founder Niki Homma passed away last year at age 70, Pique, a local magazine, wrote, \u201cIt's difficult to overstate just how groundbreaking Sushi Village was in its early years. Along with being the resort's lone Japanese restaurant in an era long before the West Coast developed its current sushi obsession, its success stemmed not from a desire to make money, but a lively, sometimes debaucherous atmosphere that remains virtually unparalleled to this day.\u201d\n\nReason to visit: Specialty sushi rolls, karage, takoyaki, sake.\n\nThe food: The menu is vast, with a huge assortment of specialty sushi rolls, a full range of more traditional nigiri sushi (individual pieces over vinegared rice) and lots of non-sushi dishes such as various teriyakis, donburis (rice bowls topped with varied ingredients), udon bowls, tempuras, hot pots, other assorted main courses and lots of appetizers and salads. There are 65 sushi options alone, and more than two dozen sakes to accompany these.\n\nThe main event is the house specialty rolls, large and ornate and often fun, such as the KFC roll, made with karage, Japanese-style fried chicken, which is sliced thin and wrapped with avocado. The hot volcano roll is another signature, seared tuna with mango, jalape\u00f1os and tobiko, orange-colored fish roe. The BC features barbecue salmon skin, highlighting the most famous seafood of the Pacific Northwest, with veggies and tobiko. The spider roll is deep-fried breaded softshell crab with avocado, daikon radish and cucumber, and is one of the best choices. Depending on your tastes and personal favorite proteins, all of these are well-executed, with some interesting combinations you are unlikely to find elsewhere, and you can actually taste the ingredients, unlike many contemporary sushi places where the rolls swallow up the flavors inside them.\n\nWhile it looks a lot like the ubiquitous local sushi spot now found anywhere, it is important to remember that Sushi Village was a forerunner of the trend and as a result, has a higher level of authenticity in its menu than most competitors in North America. As a result, my favorites were some of the bar food specialties, snacks that you would find in real Japanese izakayas and are less common here, like takoyaki, octopus meat cooked in puffy pastry in bite-size spheres, topped with brown sauce and dried fish flakes. I personally love Japanese-style fried chicken, karage, usually boneless pieces with a very crisp breading, another comfort food bar snack hard to find in North America. The version here is delicious, with perfectly seasoned coating and cooked to order, so it is served hot and juicy. It is also offered in a spicy option that is really good.\n\nFew major ski resorts are as close to the ocean as Whistler/Blackcomb, and fish are brought in from Vancouver. The traditional nigiri sushi and sliced sashimi were all first-rate, and I especially liked the hamachi (yellowtail). If you love fish, it is hard to go wrong.\n\nThe bar has an extensive craft beer and wine list, but Sushi Village is most famous for its sake and derivatives such as sake margaritas. There is a separate sake menu with more than two dozen styles, including my personal favorite, milky white unfiltered nigori sake, and the list is elaborately written with flavor details and style notes to help newcomers choose their perfect selection. But the restaurant is especially known for its shareable bottles of hot sake, in four sizes: traditional, large, jumbo and Dumbo, the unofficial apr\u00e8s ski king of Whistler. While this shareable giant, served in hand-painted, one-of-a-kind bottles, is a local institution, sake is best enjoyed cold and I\u2019d recommend choosing off the list. But no matter what you pick to eat or drink you are likely going to have good time at this spot that has been pleasing visitors for three decades.\n\nPilgrimage-worthy?: Yes \u2013 dinner at Sushi Village is a must-try rite of passage for any visitor to the famous ski and summer resort.\n\nRating: Yum!

Can they do anything against the Titans, the stingiest defense against tight ends? Maybe.

John Harbaugh could elect to start Robert Griffin III over Joe Flacco if the latter sits with an injury, or Flacco could play through his hip problem. But if the first-rounder is in for the game against the Bengals, it\u2019s an intriguing matchup.\n\nRB Rashaad Penny, Seattle Seahawks\n\nChris Carson might be back. Mike Davis looked good last week. But so did Penny, and I\u2019m wondering if he plays a lot more as a pass-catcher on Thursday if Aaron Rodgers pulls the Packers ahead.

Security footage shows one robbery during store hours. USA TODAY\n\nSecurity footage shows thieves rushing into a San Francisco Bay Area Apple store and grabbing devices on display while staff and customers looked on. (Photo: Santa Rosa, California, Police)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 All the thefts were brazen, quick and lucrative. And \u2013 so far \u2013 not deadly.\n\nTypically operating in groups of five or six, the hooded individuals burst into the Apple Stores, cut cables tethering iPhones and iPads, and within seconds were gone netting tens of thousands in hot tech merchandise.\n\nAlthough this recent rash of thefts across California may slow \u2013 state attorney general Xavier Becerra announced in September the arrest of 17 individuals connected to $1 million in Apple store robberies across 19 counties \u2013 they're indicative of a growing problem facing national retailers as the holiday shopping season nears.\n\nExperts in the field known as loss prevention say a combination of factors has given rise to a new level of threat to merchandise, employees and, alarmingly, customers, as organized gangs display more aggression during robberies than in years past.\n\nWhile to date none of these Apple robberies has resulted in significant injuries or deaths, with store workers and shoppers largely relegated to being stunned bystanders, the potential for an altercation gone bad looms large.\n\nIn 2017, there were 424 violent deaths in retail locations, according to The D&D Daily, a retail publication that monitors loss prevention. In the first quarter of 2018, there has been a 12 percent increase over the same time last year in violent deaths, half of them customers.\n\nWhile most of those are at convenience stores and pharmacies, \"big box retails from Walmart on down are making what they're calling 'store safeness' a priority,\" says Gus Downing, publisher of The D&D Daily. \"But no one has enough money to guarantee total security.\"\n\nThe prospect of a customer being hurt is \"a retailer\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d says Robert Moraca, vice president of loss prevention for the National Retail Federation. \u201cThere is a new level of aggressiveness, which a quarter of our members say has increased in the past year.\"\n\nRetailers report witnessing thieves yelling at customers to get on the ground, punching store employees and occasionally using mace. Two security guards at different Walmart stores were killed by thieves recently, says Moraca, who attributes this escalation to \"a lot of cultural factors.\u201d\n\nAmong them: the ease with which one can unload stolen goods through online platforms or by sending them overseas; jail overcrowding resulting in a loosening of criminal penalties for those stealing less than $1,000 in goods; police department financial strains cutting into officer ranks; and even the opioid crisis fueling desperation among cash-poor addicts.\n\nWhat\u2019s also at issue is the pressure brick-and-mortar retailers feel to create open-air floor plans to entice consumers \u2013 a style exemplified by Apple\u2019s sleek stores where goods are readily on display \u2013 who have the option of shopping safely online.\n\nMore: Retailers lost less to theft, fraud in 2017; retail cyber crime growing\n\nRelated: Calif. authorities charge 17 people in Apple store theft scheme\n\nConsidering that retailers are expected to earn $1.1 trillion in holiday sales this year, according to Deloitte, a 5 percent increase over last year. Given that potential haul, it is unlikely stores will consider measures that could deter impulse-shopping buyers.\n\n\u201cIf you put up too much friction by securing your items, your sales plummet,\u201d says Walter E. Palmer, practice leader at Epic Integrated Risk Solutions, the loss prevention advisory arm of Epic Insurance.\n\nPalmer says that while many grab-and-run thefts such as the ones at the California Apple Stores are perpetrated by gangs working for organized crime rings, the nation's drug addiction epidemic has driven up the number of individuals willing to steal to fund a fix.\n\n\u201cIt all adds up to a bad recipe for stores,\u201d he says, noting that his retail clients are eager to ways to keep the shopping experience safe without driving consumers away with heavy-handed security practices. \u201c(Retailers) are not cavalier about this issue by any means, but it\u2019s a difficult situation.\u201d\n\nAll retailers feeling the pain\n\nApple is by no means alone in grappling with theft, although its pricey wares consistently make those retail locations the nation's highest grossing, around $5,000 per square foot, almost double that of Tiffany\u2019s.\n\nAccording to a 2017 National Retail Federation survey of 63 retailers of varying sizes, 95 percent reported suffering from organized retail crime. Beyond electronics, hot items include designer clothing, razors and blades, designer handbags and various over the counter drugs.\n\nLululemon Athletica shares saw a great gain on Friday after the company announced that its most recent quarterly results Thursday afternoon. (Photo: Rob Crandall / Shutterstock.com)\n\nRetailers largely see such losses as part of the cost of doing business. For every $1 billion in sales, retailers lose $726,000. With U.S. retail sales at $5 trillion last year, that\u2019s around $36 billion lost to crime and other fraud.\n\nTop cities for retail crime typically have large ports where such goods arrive, and can also easily exit. They include top-seeded Los Angeles, followed by New York, Houston and Miami, the survey says.\n\nOpioid plague a factor\n\nRichard Hollinger, professor emeritus at the University of Florida who has been studying retail crime for three decades, says grab-and-run crimes have been around forever. But the growth of organized gangs and the surge in opioid use means that today\u2019s criminals have the potential to be far more violent.\n\n\u201cRetailers are loathe to send staff after criminals, and in fact the attitude mostly is if they\u2019ve hit the door, let them go, because they could be high or have a weapon,\u201d says Hollinger.\n\nA serious injury or, worse, death of a staffer or customer \u201cwould be a game changer, but at the same time, because retailers are concerned about optics they can\u2019t lock everything down. Shopping remains a tactile, visual experience.\u201d\n\nAn Apple store on Sept. 20 in China. (Photo: Apple)\n\nUSA TODAY contacted a range of retailers such as Walmart and CVS to seek comment about retail crime.\n\nMost either declined to comment, citing security reasons, or offered variations of Lululemon\u2019s statement: \u201cWe take crime very seriously and are following our protocol for responding to these incidents and cooperating with local authorities.\u201d\n\nThose authorities are busy. USA TODAY reached out to about two dozen police departments across California, where nearly a quarter of its 200 stores are located, and found that more than half the Apple stores in California made at least one call about a theft or robbery in the past year.\n\nBetween October 2017 and 2018, the Los Angeles Police Department received 532 calls for service about theft from the six Apple stores it covers, according to records.\n\nOf those 532 calls, 40 were classified as grand thefts, meaning 7.5 percent resulted in losses of $950 or more.\n\nApple is paying some local authorities to be stationed outside its store doors.\n\nIn one typical arrangement, officers sign up at the station house and are paid by the police department, and Apple then reimburses the department, says Margo Rohrbacher, public information officer with the Central Marin Police Department just north of San Francisco. She says the department is scheduling officers out through the end of the year.\n\nThe area\u2019s local Apple store in Corte Madera has been hit twice in recent months, mostly recently in August when five hoodie-wearing youths were caught on camera grabbing small electronics from display tables. In mere seconds they stole $24,000 worth of goods and disappeared into waiting cars.\n\n\u201cWe hear that people come up to the officers and say they\u2019re happy to see them there, it makes them feel more comfortable,\u201d says Rohrbacher.\n\nPaying for protection\n\nApple has taken that approach in other store locations plagued by theft. (A company spokesman declined to comment citing \u201cmatters of security.\u201d)\n\nAfter three thefts in four days at the Roseville, California, Apple location, officers began working security every day from open to close, says public information officer Rob Baquera. There have been no thefts since the officers started their overtime shifts in September, Baquera told USA TODAY.\n\nIn this Dec. 10, 2014 photo, a van sits inside the glass entrance of a Neiman-Marcus store on North Michigan Avenue, in Chicago. At least a dozen \"crash-and-grab\" burglaries, in which gangs drive stolen cars directly into retail businesses, has shop owners nervous and police stumped in Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. (Photo: Brian Jackson, AP)\n\nFresno also has an ongoing contract with Apple, where an officer with a patrol car is stationed at the store from open to close after a July theft totaled $27,000 in losses, said public information officer Lt. Mark Hudson.\n\nAdding such security comes at a price. For example, Apple has collectively paid the Roseville and Fresno police departments, which both have ongoing contracts, about $148,000 from March to October, USA TODAY calculated based on supplemental law enforcement services rates listed online, records and interviews.\n\nApple is hardly alone in paying for customer peace of mind. In Berkeley, Apple used to payfor police to patrol its store as did Lululemon, the popular athletic wear brand, says public information officer Byron White.\n\n\u201cShoplifting is something that happens throughout the city,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just unique to Apple. It\u2019s just Apple gets a lot more publicity.\u201d\n\nRetail robbery do's and don'ts\n\nSo what can be done to stop or mitigate the impact of this rash of thefts that seem to be growing in frequency?\n\nLoss prevention experts say that retailers are experimenting with a range of options including video surveillance systems that flag security of behavior that\u2019s deemed suspicious, such as an individual not moving for an extended period of time perhaps because he or she is serving as lookout.\n\nCLOSE Here's the latest for Wednesday, August 2nd: Lawsuit claims White House, Fox News, conspired to fabricate news story; VP Pence in Montenegro; Police say customer shot, killed pharmacy robbery suspect; Last of 12 Alabama escapees caught. AP\n\nThere are also in-house training programs aimed at helping store employees learn \u201cverbal judo,\u201d says Moraca, in order to de-escalate aggressive situations.\n\nAnd when it comes specifically to electronics such as smartphones and tablets, one solution, if a time-consuming one, would be to take the time to connect each display gadget to a cloud service such as iCloud, which then would allow each device to be shut down after it is stolen.\n\n\u201cBut that would involve a whole level of systems administrations dedicated just to getting these display devices on and then off the cloud,\u201d says security expert Ralph Echemendia, also known as The Ethical Hacker. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear a company like Apple would want to invest in that, since the loss of the items themselves is just a drop in the bucket for them.\u201d\n\nCLOSE A couple is using a baby to help them steal thousands of dollars in electronics from Walmart stores across Southeast Texas, according to police. VPC\n\nIndeed, whether it\u2019s yoga workout pants or razor blades or even TVs and smartphones, while theft does bite into the bottom line the losses so far seem to remain in the realm of what large retailers such as Apple, CVS and others are willing to live with.\n\nWhat would change that calculus, however, is any incident that sees an employee or customer injured or worse during a robbery. And for the moment, loss prevention specialists say that\u2019s a reality retailers prefer not to contemplate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the classic dilemma of retail,\u201d says Hollinger, a longtime advisor to members of the National Retail Federation. \u201cYou don\u2019t want your stores to be just display areas where goods are locked down. But if something happens to someone (during a robbery), it can become a really bad public relations issue for you, and quickly.\u201d\n\nFollow Nation writers @marcodellacava and @kristinslam on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/14/shopping-holiday-season-keep-your-eyes-door/1701218002/", "", "CLOSE If you never got to go to space camp as a kid, now is your chance.

Communicating with mission control, we determine a sensor simply malfunctioned. We clear the anomaly, breath a sigh of relief and speed ahead.\n\nOnce we dock, it's time for a space walk to complete a small structure.

My task of screwing some poles into round steel pegs shouldn't be that hard, but I have gloves on, the chair tilts easily, and the little buggers are tricky.

And to say you need the \"right stuff\" to enter NASA's astronaut ranks is an understatement: Just a tiny fraction of a fraction of 1 percent of those who apply are accepted.\n\nKatharine Lackey is suited up for a space walk mission on Oct. 24, 2018, at Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama. (Photo: Katharine Lackey, USA TODAY)\n\nWith a manned mission to Mars possible in the next few decades, the challenges of training will only increase as we prepare astronauts for a trip that sends mankind 34 million miles away from home for the first time.\n\n\"It's very different than being on the moon where you can get back in three days,\" said Mae Jemison, a former NASA astronaut and the first black woman to travel to space. \"It's a completely different ballgame.\"\n\nI didn't get to experience living in a very confined space with an environment outside that will kill me instantaneously without a spacesuit. That's what astronauts who travel to the International Space Station today already face, but the time it takes to complete just a one-way trip to Mars \u2013 nine to 11 months, give or take \u2013 will exponentially increase the psychological challenges, and how we train people for them.\n\nSpace Camp's model of the International Space Station in Huntsville, Alabama.

They're going to have to figure out ways to test and see that beforehand,\" she said.\n\nAnd the training won't only involve the astronauts \u2013 but the family and friends they leave behind as well, said Lowell Zoller, former NASA project manager and emeritus docent at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center.\n\n\"If you're going to Mars or something goes wrong you cannot just say, 'let's turn around and go back'. It\u2019s not a matter of let's go home,\" he said. \"We're going to have to condition the families and people here on Earth as much as we condition the astronauts because this is the first time we were sending people far enough away that they can't see home.\"\n\nA replica of the lunar excursion module, designed for operations on the moon, sits in the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, on Oct. 25, 2018.

Because, if you take the really long view, we simply have to, says Stephen Petranek, author of \"How We\u2019ll Live on Mars,\" upon which National Geographic's series \"MARS\" is based.\n\nThe half-documentary, half-scripted drama TV show jumps back and forth between present day Earth \u2013 where it shows how we currently are preparing to get to Mars and talks about issues that will develop once we get there \u2013 and a future where human beings live on and, eventually, industrialize the planet.\n\n\"Humans have been a nomadic species moving on from place to place on Earth for 95 percent of their existence,\" he said. \"There's a survival mechanism built into our DNA which says you should move on to the next horizon and the next wilderness.\"\n\nEventually, the sun will heat up and expand, consuming all life on Earth and probably throwing the planet out of orbit, Petranek said.

When he went into space for the first time, Melvin was in charge of robotics. His job centered around the installation of another module to the International Space Station.\n\n\"I'd never done that before. I'd only done it in the equivalent of a video game,\" he said. \"All of our training is basically screens and hand controllers, just like a video game.\"\n\nMission Specialist Leland Melvin poses for a photo on the shuttle Atlantis.

As a NFL player, he was well versed in the mental discipline and physical aptitude needed to pass the rigorous tests. \"Land survival, water survival \u2013 those weren't too difficult for me,\" he said.\n\nThe hardest \u2013 and what ended up being his favorite \u2013 part of training?

(Photo: Jon Elswick, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Shortly after 9/11, the CIA considered using a drug it thought might work like a truth serum and force terror suspects to give up information about potential attacks.\n\nAfter months of research, the agency decided that a drug called Versed, a sedative often prescribed to reduce anxiety, was \u201cpossibly worth a try.\u201d But in the end, the CIA decided not to ask government lawyers to approve its use.\n\nThe existence of the drug research program \u2013 dubbed \u201cProject Medication\u201d \u2013 is disclosed in a once-classified report that was provided to the American Civil Liberties Union under a judge\u2019s order and was released by the organization Tuesday.\n\nThe 90-page CIA report, which was provided in advance to The Associated Press, is a window into the internal struggle that medical personnel working in the agency\u2019s detention and harsh interrogation program faced in reconciling their professional ethics with the chance to save lives by preventing future attacks.\n\n\u201cThis document tells an essential part of the story of how it was that the CIA came to torture prisoners against the law and helps prevent it from happening again,\u201d said ACLU attorney Dror Ladin.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2007, CIA doctors, psychologists, physician assistants and nurses were directly involved in the interrogation program, the report said. They evaluated, monitored and cared for 97 detainees in 10 secret CIA facilities abroad and accompanied detainees on more than 100 flights.\n\nThe CIA ultimately decided against asking the Justice Department to approve drug-assisted interrogations, sparing CIA doctors \u201csome significant ethical concerns,\u201d the report said. It had taken months for the Justice Department to sign off on brutal interrogation tactics, including sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces and the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding. The CIA\u2019s counterterrorism team \u201cdid not want to raise another issue with the Department of Justice,\u201d the report said.\n\nBefore settling on Versed, the report said researchers studied records of old Soviet drug experiments as well as the CIA\u2019s discredited MK-Ultra program from the 1950s and 1960s that involved human experimentation with LSD and other mind-altering drugs on unwitting individuals as part of a long search for some form of truth serum. These experiments were widely criticized and, even today, some experts doubt an effective substance exists.\n\n\u201cBut decades later, the agency was considering experimenting on humans again to test pseudo-scientific theories of learned helplessness on its prisoners,\u201d Ladin said.\n\nVersed is a brand name for the sedative midazolam, used since the late 1970s and today sold commonly as a generic.

The document is not the CIA\u2019s or the Office of Medical Service\u2019s \u201cfinal official history, or assessment, of the program,\u201d the lawyers wrote.\n\nThe ACLU spent more than two years in court trying to get the report released. In September 2017, a federal judge in New York ordered the CIA to release it. Government lawyers tried three more times to keep information contained in the report under wraps, but the ACLU received the bulk of the report in August. The government is still fighting to keep portions secret. They are to file briefs in a federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday, arguing that the judge ordered too much released.\n\nWhile the CIA\u2019s harsh interrogation program ended in 2007, the ACLU believes it\u2019s important to continue seeking the release of documents about it, especially since President Donald Trump declared during his campaign that he would approve interrogating terror suspects with waterboarding, which is now banned by U.S. law, and a \u201chell of a lot worse.\u201d\n\nCIA Director Gina Haspel, who was involved in supervising a secret CIA detention site in Thailand where detainees were waterboarded, told the Senate during her confirmation hearing that she does \u201cnot support use of enhanced interrogation techniques for any purpose.\u201d\n\nMore: CIA releases 470,000 documents confiscated in bin Laden raid\n\nThe report cites many instances where medical personal expressed concern or protected the health of the detainees. Those who were thrown up against walls \u2013 a practice called \u201cwalling\u201d \u2013 had their necks protected from whiplash by rolled towels around their necks, the report said. When one detainee, who had been wounded during capture, was confined to a box, care was taken not to force his legs into a position that \u201cwould compromise wound healing.\u201d Physician assistants overruled using duct tape over the mouths of detainees during flights because air sickness could lead to vomiting and possible aspiration.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that the doctors were sadistic or anything like that,\u201d Ladin said. \u201cBut it means they were complicit because this pseudo-scientific torture could not have happened without the doctors\u2019 participation.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the medical office\u2019s report said waterboarding was not \u201cintrinsically painful.\u201d It said there was \u201cphysical discomfort from the occasional associated retching,\u201d but that two detainees who endured the most extensive waterboarding sessions complained only \u201cof the pain of the restraining straps.\u201d\n\nThat contrasts with the Senate\u2019s 2014 report on the CIA\u2019s interrogation program, which stated that a prisoner known as Abu Zubaydah, a suspected al-Qaida operative who was waterboarded more than 80 times, \u201ccried, begged, pleaded, vomited, and required medical resuscitation after being waterboarded.\u201d\n\nSome CIA medical personnel called waterboarding \u201clittle more than an amateurish experiment\u201d and others worried that the practice would trigger spasms of the vocal cords, which could, at least temporarily, make it hard to speak or breathe.\n\nAt the same time, other medical personnel contended waterboarding actually \u201cprovided periodic relief\u201d to a prisoner because it was a break from being forced to stand for long periods of time. The agency medical personnel also said the harsh interrogation program was \u201creassuringly free of enduring physical or psychological effects.\u201d\n\nDr. Sondra Crosby, who has treated victims of torture, including two who were held at CIA secret sites, disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe enduring pain and suffering experienced by the survivors of the CIA program is immense, and includes severe, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, physical ailments, and psychosocial dysfunction,\u201d said Crosby, of Boston University\u2019s School of Medicine and Public Health. \u201cAt least one detainee was tortured to death.\u201d\n\nJFK files: CIA lined up actress for date with Jordan's King Hussein during visit to United States\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/14/cia-truth-serum-after-9-11/1997442002/", "CLOSE Getting tickets for \"Hamilton\" still seems like an impossible task, and of course at this point, it's impossible to see it with creator Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2026 or is it?

Working on the business can mean a lot of things, but here it means taking the time to think ahead and plan for the upcoming selling season, be it the holidays, or summer, or whatever.\n\nIf you are running behind, fear not. Here are 3 powerful ways to rock your digital marketing this holiday season, even if you are just getting started:\n\n1. Launch a Google Ads campaign.\n\nPreviously known as Google AdWords, Google Ads allow searchers to find your products while they are looking for similar items or information on Google. While it is very difficult to get on the first page of a Google search result organically (no matter what the \u201cexperts\u201d say), you can buy your way to a Page 1 result with a Google ad.\n\nAnd think about this: What are people looking for when they search on Google? Answer: Information RIGHT NOW about a subject. If they see your ad when they are highly motivated and searching, that can quickly turn into a warm lead.\n\nMore: Baret Bats: Air Force veteran's hand-crafted small business hits a home run\n\nMore: Macy's holiday windows for 2018: Meet Sunny the Snowpal\n\nMore: How do cyber-criminals hack small business startups? Here's what we learned from Microsoft\n\nThe secret is to target the right keywords, words people will likely use in their search that relates to your products. Use a keyword research tool to find highly searched words related to your product. Say that you sell snowboards in Maine. Target keywords such as \u201cSnowboards, Maine,\" \"best skiing gifts\u201d or \u201cgiving a snowboard.\u201d Then create specific landing pages for those products and advertise on Google targeting these desired keywords.\n\nVoila! You are instantly back in the holiday sales game.\n\nKeys to success:\n\n\u2022 Have a call to action: \u201cSale ends in 3 days!\u201d \u201c25% off this week only!\u201d\n\n\u2022 Use the magic words: \u201cFree\u201d and \u201cSale\u201d are the two most powerful words in advertising\n\n\u2022 Use seasonal words: \u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d \u201cHoliday sale!\u201d\n\n\u2022 Test and refine: Google Ads are great because you can check results 24/7 and make necessary changes immediately.\n\n2. Use retargeting.\n\nYou know this drill. You read an article about Hawaiian vacations, or click on a link about them, and then all of a sudden, ads for Hawaiian vacations are all you see online for two weeks. That\u2019s called retargeting.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: Say someone comes to your site to check out your snowboards. With retargeting, a cookie ends up on their computer (it\u2019s legal, don\u2019t worry), and ads for your snowboards then show up while they are reading a news site, or watching a video, or whatever.\n\nRetargeting is great because it helps keep your site and brand and products top of mind.\n\n3. Use seasonal video in your email marketing.\n\nWhat is the most important part of selling online \u2013 price, availability, 2-day-shipping? Nope, nope, and nope. As it turns out, selling online often requires some sort of emotional connection. If people feel good about your business or product, they are far more likely to buy it.\n\nThat\u2019s where your e-newsletter generally, and video specifically, comes into play. Your e-newsletter is great because it is a personal connection with your tribe, and even better, they have opted-in; they want you to email them.\n\nVideo doubles down on that. People love to watch video online, and in an e-newsletter it is clicked more than anything. So create some friendly, fun, and/or personal holidays videos and share them in your seasonal e-newsletter. Have the staff sing a Christmas carol, or have your VP of sales make a cheesy video. Give a personal, warm season\u2019s greeting.\n\nThe good news is that you need not worry if you haven\u2019t started your holiday marketing. Use these tricks and there is still plenty of time.\n\n\u2014\n\nSteve Strauss, @Steve Strauss on Twitter, is a lawyer specializing in small business and entrepreneurship who has been writing for USATODAY.com for 20 years.

One dozed in a darkened room, the other was wrapped in a blanket in the locked cafeteria.\n\nThe sleeping staffers became a focal point of a new, scathing internal report about patient care at the facility, sparked by a nurse\u2019s complaint that veterans were getting substandard care, according to a letter sent late last month to President Donald Trump and Congress by the agency that protects government whistleblowers.\n\n\u201cWe have significant concern about the blatant disregard for veteran safety by the registered nurses and certified nurse assistants,\u201d agency investigators wrote in a report about the 112-bed facility. The Brockton facility is a one-star nursing home, the lowest rating in the agency\u2019s own quality ranking system.\n\nVA spokeswoman Pallas Wahl said officials took \u201cimmediate corrective action,\u201d and the employees caught sleeping no longer work there.\n\nThe problems at the Brockton nursing home are the latest to surface in a review of VA nursing home care by USA TODAY and The Boston Globe.\n\nIn June, the news organizations revealed the VA\u2019s secret quality ratings showed that care at more than 100 VA nursing homes across the country scored worse than private nursing home averages on a majority of key quality indicators last year.\n\nIn response to questions from USA TODAY and the Globe, the VA released nursing home ratings that had been kept secret for years, potentially depriving veterans and their families of crucial health care information.\n\nAt the time, the VA said it was releasing inspection reports the agency withheld from the public for nearly a decade. Five months later, none has been released.\n\nVA spokesman Curt Cashour told USA TODAY that the agency is working with an outside contractor to remove patient information from reports. He said the VA expects to release \"publicly redacted versions of the most recent reports\" around Christmas.\n\nThat's not good enough for Leslie Roe, whose husband of 38 years walked out of a supposedly secure unit at the VA nursing home in Tuskegee, Alabama, last year and was never found.\n\nRoe, who had Navy veteran Earl \"Jim\" Zook declared dead this year, wants the VA to immediately release three years' worth of inspection reports \u2013 the standard for private-sector nursing homes whose reports are posted on a federal website, NursingHomeCompare.\n\n\"It's just a shame the way the VA is,\" she said. \"It can't help Jim, but maybe it can help just one other person.\"\n\nThe reports can include incidents of poor care and conditions that can be a tip-off to prospective or current residents and their families about problems with staffing or neglect at a facility.\n\n\"What are they hiding? Why wouldn\u2019t you release it?\" asked Amy Leise, whose uncle, Vietnam veteran Don Ruch, suffered from malnutrition and bedsores last year at a VA nursing home in Livermore, California.\n\nA trauma wound on Vietnam veteran Don Ruch's right calf. (Photo: Handout)\n\n\"It feels like the government is immune from accountability and responsibility, where in other settings that wouldn't be the case,\" she said.\n\nVA releases new nursing home ratings\n\nThe VA released an updated set of star ratings. They show 45 of its nursing homes received the lowest one out of five stars for quality as of June 30. That\u2019s down from 58 in March. The VA has 133 nursing homes that serve 46,000 infirm veterans each year across the country.\n\nMore: Secret VA nursing home ratings for 2017\n\nAt the nursing home in Brockton, residents were, on average, more likely than residents of other VA nursing homes to deteriorate, feel serious pain or suffer from bedsores, according to agency data. They were nearly three times as likely to have bedsores than residents of private nursing homes.\n\nLicensed practical nurse Patricia Labossiere said she complained to the Office of Special Counsel, a federal whistleblower agency, this year after supervisors in Brockton ignored her alerts.\n\n\u201cI am a no-nonsense nurse who took a vow to take care of patients,\u201d said Labossiere, who quit in July. \u201cWe are there to be kind and treat others as we would want to be treated. I could not believe that this was how we treat the people that fought for our country.\u201d\n\nLabossiere said she saw instance after instance of poor patient care at the facility within days after she started working there last December. She told the federal whistleblower agency that nurses and aides did not empty the bedside urinals of frail veterans. Nurses failed to provide clean water at night and didn\u2019t check on the veterans regularly, as required, she said. They often slept when they were supposed to be working.\n\nShe offered some specific examples: One patient had trouble breathing because his oxygen tank was empty. Another fell \u2013 his feeding tube got disconnected, and the liquid splashed onto the floor \u2013 and didn\u2019t appear to have been monitored by staffers for hours.\n\nThe VA investigators did not substantiate those allegations, saying the patient with the empty oxygen tank suffered no ill effects. Investigators couldn\u2019t confirm that the patient who fell had been neglected because the records were shredded \u201cin accordance with the local policy.\u201d\n\n'Routinely receiving substandard care'\n\nThe VA nursing home in Brockton, Mass., is among the lowest-rated. (Photo: John Tlumacki, The Boston Globe)\n\nWahl, the VA spokeswoman, noted that the investigators \u201cdid not find evidence of veteran harm or neglect.\u201d She said the facility\u2019s one-star rating is undeserved and not an \u201caccurate reflection of the quality of care delivered to our patients.\"\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel ordered the VA\u2019s Office of Medical Inspector to investigate Brockton after Labossiere\u2019s complaint. The office turned over its report in September to special counsel Henry Kerner, who sent the findings to Trump and Congress on Oct. 23.\n\n\u201cBecause a brave whistleblower came forward, VA investigators were able to substantiate that patients at the Brockton (nursing home) were routinely receiving substandard care,\u201d Kerner said in an emailed statement.\n\nThis is not the first time the Brockton facility has come under fire by the Office of Medical Inspector.\n\nIn 2014, a doctor at the nursing home alleged that three veterans with significant mental health issues received \u201cinappropriate medical and mental health care.\u201d\n\nTwo of them went years, he alleged, without appropriate treatment. A third allegedly received psychotropic drugs for more than two years against written instructions.\n\nInvestigators largely substantiated the allegations, finding that two veterans with significant psychiatric issues did not receive adequate treatment for years.

USA TODAY\n\nNationals right fielder Bryce Harper is seeking a deal worth more than $300 million. (Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nBryce Harper, a National League MVP at 23, is a free agent at 26, peddling his services in an industry that\u2019s grown to nearly $11 billion in annual revenues. His combination of skills, age and marketing cachet make him an excellent fit for any major league baseball franchise.\n\nParticularly the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHarper, a career .279 hitter with 184 home runs, rejected a 10-year, $300 million contract in September from the Washington Nationals.\n\nA look at why Harper -- the top free agent on the open market -- could and should sign with the Cardinals:\n\nWherever Harper lands, the big-picture implications will far outweigh a team\u2019s 2019 alignment. As it turns out, Harper fits in St. Louis now and later.\n\nHis signing would displace the struggling Dexter Fowler in right field, though it won\u2019t make the $50 million owed Fowler disappear. That\u2019s OK \u2013 Fowler could assume a reserve role, reboot his career and take a crack at a starting job in 2020, when Marcell Ozuna likely departs in free agency.\n\nIn the meantime, a Harper-Harrison Bader-Ozuna outfield gives the Cardinals a nice balance of power and defense. Ozuna hit 37 homers for the 2017 Miami Marlins, but managed just 23 and a .758 OPS in 2018, due in large part to a right shoulder that required a \u201ccleanup\u201d surgery last month.\n\nAssuming Ozuna is healthy, a Matt Carpenter-Ozuna-Harper pairing near the top of the lineup would be punishing. Harper\u2019s presence and Carpenter\u2019s versatility means the club could deploy young sluggers Jose Martinez and Tyler O\u2019Neill in creative platoons \u2013 or deal one of them for depth elsewhere.\n\nAbove all, they\u2019d be buying Harper\u2019s lifetime .388 on-base percentage and .900 OPS, sticking it in the middle of the lineup for the next decade-plus and working out the details later.\n\nOff the field\n\nAs much as The Cardinal Way and the mythology surrounding it evokes an image of the selfless, noble organization where the whole (milk?) is greater than the sum of its parts, let\u2019s be honest: The Cardinals love their superstars. From Hornsby to Musial to Gibson to Brock, to Ozzie, Pujols and Yadi, a club has stamped its imprint on a vast region of the country thanks to a gaggle of generational talents.\n\nAnd there\u2019s about to be a significant void.\n\nYadier Molina, a shoo-in to don the red coat of Cardinal hall of famer and a decent bet for Cooperstown, turns 37 next July, and his contract expires after 2020. While Molina\u2019s still performing at an All-Star level, it\u2019s not realistic to expect such returns when he\u2019s on the doorstep of 40.\n\nBader is a nice player, but with defense his primary calling card, not the sort around which to build a movement. Their top emerging players are all pitchers \u2013 Jack Flaherty, Dakota Hudson, Alex Reyes \u2013 with no slam-dunk positional superstars near the top of the minors.\n\nStepping into this void would also have some appeal for Harper.\n\nIt\u2019s long been presumed he\u2019d yearn for the bright lights of one of the coasts or a major market like Chicago. Heck, he idolizes old Yankees, hails from Las Vegas and has a dog named Wrigley.\n\nYet none of those places provide the clean landing he could stick in St. Louis.\n\nImagine signing with the Yankees, and possibly displacing Giancarlo Stanton, or trying to gamely share the spotlight with Aaron Judge.\n\nImagine signing with the Cubs, and possibly being perceived as the guy who forced franchise icon (and Vegas pal) Kris Bryant out of town when he\u2019s eligible for free agency.\n\nImagine signing with the Dodgers and taking on all the expectations as the star for whom they broke the bank while they treat the rest of the roster like Tampa Bay West.\n\nIn St. Louis, he\u2019d have no such concerns, and for a good while be hailed as The Superstar Who Chose Us. That would allay plenty of initial pressure players face when switching teams.\n\nWhy they could pull it off\n\nWith a franchise value estimated at $1.9 billion and annual revenues approaching $350 million, according to Forbes, the Cardinals certainly have the cash. They also have a decent bit of financial flexibility.\n\nThe contracts of Carpenter ($14.75 million), Molina ($20 million) and Fowler and Carlos Martinez ($16.5 million and $11.7 million, respectively) fall off the books each of the next three seasons, leaving only shortstop Paul DeJong\u2019s team-friendly pact as a long-term commitment. If their young pitching continues panning out, that would buy further flexibility in the early years of the deal.\n\nWorth noting: Had Albert Pujols accepted the Cardinals\u2019 reported 10-year, $210 million offer (in 2011 dollars, no less), there\u2019d still be three years remaining on that deal.

That they lack the financial muscle of the game\u2019s big-market beasts. That they excel at finishing second but rarely winning the player \u2013 be it their own talents like Pujols or Jason Heyward or convincing a megawatt star like Stanton to come to town.\n\nFor Harper, there are far more unknowns. Despite his occasional dropping of context clues \u2013 look, it\u2019s Harper, Bryant and their wives, out on the town! \u2013 Harper has truly played this process close to the vest. What we do know is that before he was old enough to drive, he\u2019s been riding shotgun with super agent Scott Boras. Bet on Harper getting exactly what he wants \u2013 be it a record-setting contract, a consistent chance to win, a return to Washington, a destination close to home.\n\nThe Cardinals can certainly fulfill many of those desires.\n\nFollow Lacques on Twitter @GabeLacques", "", "", "Mourners visit the Tree of Life Synagogue on Oct. 29, 2018, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh after 11 were killed and six others were wounded Saturday. (Photo: Cara Owsley, The Cincinnati Enquirer)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A D.C. man who was arrested on Friday on gun charges allegedly had social media ties to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter and told relatives that the victims of the shooting \"deserved it.\"\n\nThat\u2019s according to court records on Jeffrey R. Clark, who resides in the Bloomingdale neighborhood.\n\nClark appeared in U.S. Court in D.C. on Tuesday where he was ordered held without bond. He faces two charges: one federal count of unlawful possession of firearms by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance and one District of Columbia count of possessing high-capacity magazines.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported on Clark\u2019s arrest.\n\nAccording to court documents, Clark was linked via social media to Robert Bowers, the man accused of killing 11 people inside a Pittsburgh synagogue in October, on the network Gab.\n\nGab has been the subject of much scrutiny since the shooting as Bowers was a frequent user of it and posted hateful messages on it.\n\nMore: Gab is back after site went offline for hate speech in wake of Pittsburgh shooting\n\nMore: What is Gab, the fringe social network used by Pittsburgh shooting suspect?\n\nCharging documents indicate that Clark called Bowers a \u201chero\u201d in one of his posts on it and used slurs against Jewish people.\n\nRelatives alerted authorities to Clark after the death by suicide of his brother, 23-year-old Edward \u201cTeddy\u201d Clark. Charging documents say Edward Clark killed himself on Roosevelt Island, on October 27, within hours of the deadly Pittsburgh massacre. Police recovered multiple rounds of ammunition at the scene. He did not leave a suicide note.\n\nRelatives told investigators that Jeffrey and Edward Clark were involved in the \u201calt-right\u201d movement and told them about the brothers\u2019 connection to Gab and the Pittsburgh shooter.\n\nAfter Edwards death, documents say Jeffrey Clark became more outspoken and \u201cagitated\u201d about his views, defending Bowers and telling relatives that he and his brother fantasized about killing \u201cJews and blacks,\u201d documents say.\n\nMore: Hate crimes in USA surge in 2017 with big jump in anti-Semitic attacks, FBI says\n\nThat\u2019s when relatives called police out of concern and two relatives went to Clark\u2019s house to confiscate his firearms. Investigators say of the four boxes Clark gave relatives, none contained firearms, but they did contain unregistered weapon pieces. Investigators wrote that these parts can be used to modify assault weapons.\n\nRelatives would later tell investigators that the brothers had attended the 2017 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville and believed they were pictured next to the man who allegedly drove a car into a crowd of protesters, killing one woman.\n\nThey also told investigators the brothers believed in a \u201crace revolution,\u201d that they wanted to take part in.\n\nLater, Jeffrey Clark told relatives that the Pittsburgh victims \u201cdeserved it,\u201d the documents say.\n\nIn another chilling detail in the charging documents: Relatives told investigators that they believed Edward Clark intended to commit an act of violence on the day he died as he had additional ammunition.\n\nRelatives also told investigators that both brothers frequently smoked marijuana and possibly sold it.\n\nBetween the brothers, charging documents indicated that they owned four registered firearms: two handguns, a shotgun and a rifle. Three additional unregistered guns, a handgun, a shotgun, and a rifle, were also recovered from Clarks\u2019 home, as well as kits used to convert AR-15 rifles and four high-capacity AR-15 magazines, capable of holding up to 30 rounds of ammunition.\n\nOne of the registered handguns was used by Edward Clark when he died. None of these weapons could be modified by the pieces inside the four boxes relatives obtained.\n\nUpon his arrest, Clark told FBI agents that he and his brother purchased the firearms because they believed there would be a \u201ccivil war,\u201d documents say.\n\nThe weapons charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison, while the ammunition charge carries a maximum of 1 year in prison. Both have potential financial penalties.\n\nIn the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting in October, nine faith-based organizations received nearly $1 million in funding from the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA for security.

(Photo: Scott Galvin, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nEvery Wednesday during the NFL season, USA TODAY Sports will assess everyone's favorite topic: quarterbacks. Who's hot? Who's not? Who has the most exciting matchups?\n\nHere's this week's QB Hot Sheet:\n\nFive to watch this week\n\n1. Lamar Jackson/Joe Flacco, Ravens: If a hip injury forces Flacco out of Sunday\u2019s divisional, must-win game against the Bengals, Jackson will likely start. The first-round rookie\u2019s speed and running ability could spark a Ravens offense that has been flat \u2014 scoring just 18 points a game in a five-game span that has seen four losses. If Jackson shines, it could be a glimpse into Baltimore\u2019s future.\n\n2. Matthew Stafford, Lions: Though he has played well this season, Stafford still can\u2019t escape the occasional inconsistent performance. In a loss against the Bears, he completed just 59.5 percent of his throws and had two touchdowns and two interceptions. With a Panther defense that\u2019s tied for eighth with 15 turnovers forced, he\u2019ll need to protect the ball.\n\n3. Eli Manning, Giants: In response to whispers about his job being in danger, Manning posted his best game of the season in a Monday night victory over the 49ers. Now, with a Buccaneers defense that ranks dead last in scoring (32.3 points a game) coming into town, Manning (signed through 2019) needs to stack crisp performances to erase any doubt about his future in New York.\n\n4. Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs: One half of a scintillating matchup between two 9-1 teams, Mahomes has answered every question. He leads the league in yards (3,150) and passing scores (31) and infuses versatility into Kansas City\u2019s offense. The Rams' pass rush, however, is tied for ninth in the NFL with 26 sacks, so he might need to get the ball out quicker than usual than his average of 2.85 seconds (seventh-highest).\n\n5. Jared Goff, Rams: The other half, Goff ranks second in the NFL in yards (3,134) and continues to accurately and efficiently command L.A.\u2019s attack. This is a matchup of two of the top young passers in the league. Tune in on Monday night and enjoy.\n\nThree trending up\n\n1. Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers: He torched Carolina\u2019s defense to five touchdowns (versus only three incompletions) and a perfect passer rating. Pittsburgh is rolling.\n\n2. Mitchell Trubisky, Bears: Inconsistency aside, when Trubisky and the Bears are on, they\u2019re lethal. A healthy chemistry with receiver Allen Robinson (six catches for 133 yards and two touchdowns) highlighted an efficient day against the Lions.\n\n3. Baker Mayfield, Browns: Since Hue Jackson was fired and Freddie Kitchens became interim offensive coordinator, Mayfield has completed 74.2 percent of his passes for 513 yards and has thrown five touchdowns versus just one interception.\n\nThree trending down\n\n1. Andy Dalton, Bengals: Just 12 completions for 153 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions meant the Bengals \u2014 which needed to keep pace with the explosive Saints \u2014 had no shot in their blowout loss.\n\n2. Tom Brady, Patriots: Drops and inept pass protection bear some blame, but Brady still made poor decisions and had unusual misses on throws he normally completes in a loss against the Titans. Too early to say this is the beginning of the end for TB12, but his 51.2 percent completion rate in a loss against the Titans was by far the lowest of Week 10.\n\n3. Josh Rosen, Cardinals: When the O-line is as bad as Arizona\u2019s, it\u2019s hard to dump on the rookie. But just eight catches for 58 yards to wide receivers in a loss against the Chiefs is unacceptable. It\u2019s good Rosen and offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich are using running back David Johnson in the passing game, but Rosen needs to build chemistry with his wideouts.\n\nSeason rankings\n\n1. Drew Brees (last week: 1): Saints: Another dominant performance in which he had as many incompletions (three) as TDs. His 21:1 TD-to-interception ratio is absurd.\n\n2. Mahomes (2): He broke Len Dawson\u2019s franchise record (29) for most touchdown passes in a single season. In Week 10. He\u2019s so talented and the scary thing is there are still areas where Mahomes can improve.\n\n3. Philip Rivers, Chargers (3): He posted an average game (18-26 for 223 yards, two touchdowns and one interception), but stays at No. 3 because of his work all season long. The margin behind him, though, is shrinking.\n\n4. Andrew Luck, Colts (5): Another exceptional performance was marred only by a pick that wasn\u2019t his fault. He\u2019s continuing a tremendous comeback campaign and hasn\u2019t been sacked in four straight games.\n\n5. Goff (NR): On pace to shatter career highs across major passing statistics, Goff spread the ball around and managed the game well against a tough Seahawks defense.\n\nDropped: Cam Newton (4).\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

(Nov. 13) AP\n\nA San Bernardino County firefighter yells for more water while battling a wildfire along the Mojave River in Victorville, Calif. (Photo: James Quigg, The Victor Valley Daily Press, via AP)\n\nRising casualties. Aerial assaults. Weary ground forces. The charred desolation of thousands of homes. The most apt metaphor about California's rampaging wildfires is warfare.\n\nAnd just like in any war, one of the first casualties is truth.\n\nWho or what is to blame for the conflagrations? Whether it's timber interests on one side complaining about environmental rules, or environmentalists on the other side claiming it's all about global warming, neither faction has it completely right.\n\nEven as the tragedy was unfolding, President Donald Trump weighed in on the side of lumber interests, threatening \"no more fed payments\" because of \"gross mismanagement of the forests.\"\n\nWhat federal payments he's tweeting about is anyone's guess, and 57 percent of California's forested area is owned by the federal government. If the president has a beef with how those areas are managed, he should take it up with his own administration and properly fund forest management programs.\n\nOpposing view: How to fight California's wildfires? It's an 'all of the above' response\n\nThere might, indeed, be a need to make it easier to thin dying or dead trees out of densely forested areas, reducing the fuel for wildfires. But the problem is actually more complicated. Even if dead logs are stripped away, the tinder-dry brush acts like kindling when wildfires spread.\n\nEven more to the point, dense forests were not a factor in these recent California fires. \"They're using these fires to talk about forest management that has nothing to do with the landscape in which the fires are occurring,\" says Char Miller, W.M. Keck Professor of Environmental Analysis and History at Pomona College in Claremont, California.\n\nThe Camp Fire 90 miles north of Sacramento that killed about 50 people, destroyed nearly 8,000 homes, devastated the city of Paradise, and cindered 117,000 acres \u2014 making it the state's most destructive fire ever \u2014 burned through a mix of trees, brush and grassland. And fires that forced massive evacuations outside Los Angeles fed off of chaparral or brush.\n\nClimate change is making wildfires worse. The resulting erratic weather patterns have created shorter, wetter winters in California, producing a sudden, heavy growth of shrubs, grasses and trees. After winter, the state's ongoing drought and record-high summer temperatures draw moisture out of the plants, rendering them near-perfect kindling. With the hot and dry Santa Ana winds of fall, fires explode out of control.\n\nYet these tragedies can't be blamed solely on global warming. Wildfires are actually a vital part of the state's ecosystem. Lodgepole pines, for example, thrive in fire-prone areas where millions of structures have been erected in rural areas of California since the 1940s. When they burn, the cost in lives and treasure soars.\n\nAnswering these disasters with a clipped, one-dimensional solution helps no one, although it might score short-term political points.\n\nThe proper response includes placing limits on, and fireproofing, residential expansion into wildlands; better management and removal of dry brush; and relentlessly addressing the growing concern of climate change.\n\nIn other words, the solution isn't either/or.

Fires of this size and intensity are an incredibly serious threat to our lives, property and environment, and should not be accepted as the new normal.\n\nSeveral factors may be at play, but improper forest fuel management is a clear problem.\n\nThere is now a nearly limitless supply of fuel \u2014 dead trees, drybrush and vegetation \u2014 making our forests combustible as ever. There are 129 million dead trees in California. A healthy forest should have an inventory of 60 to 80 trees per acre; ours have several hundred per acre.\n\nCommon-sense forest policies that will treat overgrown lands and prevent a manageable wildfire from turning into a catastrophic inferno are long overdue. We need a streamlined process to responsibly thin forests, especially public lands. Our forestry professionals need to be out in the forests, assessing and doing their work, not spending half their time filling out paperwork, responding to activist-funded environmental litigation.\n\nOur view: How to fight California's wildfires? It's an 'all of the above' response\n\nWe also need to reverse the loss of forest product infrastructure critical to restoration efforts, including timber harvest, hazardous fuel reduction, salvage logging, prescribed burning and the mill capacity to handle it. Trees are going to leave the forest one way or another. We can remove them responsibly ourselves, or they\u2019ll become fuel for the next catastrophic wildfire.\n\nForest waste can become the renewable fuel that powers the electric grid and provides the wood and paper products that we use daily. These jobs should be right in our backyard.\n\nIt\u2019s time to reassert our ability to limit the impact wildfires have on our communities.

A Louisiana appellate court is set to hear the case of Cardell Hayes, the man convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting retired New Orleans Saints star Will Smith. In the appeal, Hayes\u2019s attorneys say the judge in the case should have granted a new trial because a witness who contacted the defense a day after Hayes' conviction said he had heard two guns at the time of the shooting. (Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office via AP, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A defense attorney for the man convicted of killing retired New Orleans Saints star Will Smith in 2016 has told a Louisiana appellate court that his client deserves a new trial, in part because of evidence that surfaced after trial that he said lends credibility to Cardell Hayes' self-defense assertion.\n\nHayes' appeal attorney, Paul Barker, told three 4th Circuit Court of Appeal judges Wednesday that New Orleans prosecutors failed to disprove that Hayes acted in self-defense. Hayes is serving a 25-year sentence for manslaughter in Smith's death and attempted manslaughter in the wounding of Smith's wife during a confrontation following a traffic collision in April 2016.\n\nHayes insisted at trial that he fired after a drunk, angry Smith retrieved a gun from his car and fired first.\n\nBarker said none of a host of witnesses had a clear view of everything that happened amid the tumult following the accident in New Orleans' Lower Garden District.\n\nAssistant District Attorney Kyle Daly countered that Hayes was alone among witnesses in saying Smith brandished a gun or fired it. A semi-automatic handgun was found loaded but unused in Smith's car. And while Barker said gunfire residue on Smith's body raises doubt that he never fired, Daly said it was consistent with being shot at close-range with a larger weapon.\n\nIt was unclear when the three-judge appellate panel would rule.\n\nBarker argued that trial judge Camille Buras should have granted a new trial because a witness who contacted the defense a day after Hayes' conviction said he had heard two gun fire from two weapons at the time of the shooting.\n\nThe witness, military veteran Michael Burnside, delivered rambling and at times profane testimony at a post-trial hearing last year. Daly argued that he wasn't credible. Burnside lived blocks from the shooting scene and, Daly argued, his testimony indicated a series of shots fired at a slower rate than the rapid-fire shooting Hayes had described.\n\nParker also contends the trial judge should have allowed testimony about Smith's 2010 arrest on a domestic abuse charge after former Saint Deuce McAllister spoke of Smith's sterling reputation among his teammates and friends.\n\nSmith was arrested outside a southwest Louisiana bar in 2011 on misdemeanor charges of domestic abuse battery and public intoxication. Lafayette Parish prosecutors dropped the charges in 2012 after Smith completed community service and participated in counseling.\n\nDaly argued that Buras was right to avoid what would have amounted to a \"mini-trial on the Lafayette incident.\"\n\nSmith, a 34-year-old father of three, was a defensive leader on the Saints team that lifted spirits in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005. He helped carry the team to a winning season in 2006 and a Super Bowl victory four years later.\n\nHayes was 29 when he was convicted in December 2016. He owned a tow-truck business, had played semi-pro football and is the father of a young son.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP)\n\nFor months, American Catholics had been asked to be patient just a little longer. We were promised that the church\u2019s \u201csummer of shame,\u201d following only the latest revelations about the systemic cover-ups of clerical sex abuse, would finally be addressed this week in Baltimore at the biannual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be just one more round of forced apologies, either, but would involve action \u2014 and maybe even a vote on a new standard of conduct for bishops, and an outside commission to review violations of it.\n\nOnly, to the astonishment of no one past the age of reason, that\u2019s not going to happen after all.\n\nInstead, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the bishops conference \u2014 who has himself shielded at least one predator \u2014 opened the meeting by announcing that the Vatican had insisted on delaying any action until after a February Vatican summit on the scandal.\n\nLet\u2019s not be hasty, right? It would be funny if it weren\u2019t so tragic. Yet apparently, these men need a code of conduct to know not to shield rapists. And they need time to reach universal consensus on a proposal that would simply ask bishops to promise not to lead a \u201cdouble life.\u201d\n\nIn denial about long-running, far-reaching rot\n\nNo one can accuse me of being hasty. But after a lifetime of stubborn adherence on my part and criminal behavior on yours, your excellencies, you seem to have finally succeeded in driving me away. I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s such a thing as a former Catholic, but I\u2019m about to find out.\n\nMy hopes for this Baltimore confab weren\u2019t ever high, because fool me 6,000 times, shame on you.

He proves the opposite every day.\n\nWhy \u2014 despite sexual abuse scandal \u2014 I am still a faithful Catholic\n\nThen in August, we got the Pennsylvania grand jury report detailing more than 1,000 cases of abuse by more than 300 priests over seven decades. Across the country, other states have launched similar investigations, so all the hiding, stalling, law- and commandment-breaking ends here: Basta.\n\nAlready, in a joint investigation, The Boston Globe and The Philadelphia Inquirer have found that more than 130 American bishops \u2014 almost a third of all of those still living \u2014 have been accused of failing to deal appropriately with sexual misconduct by priests in their dioceses at some point in their careers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked by that number,\u201d Boston\u2019s Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, who really is the top clerical abuse adviser to Pope Francis, told The Globe. \u201cIt raises a lot of questions in my mind.\u2019\u2019\n\nI\u2019m shocked that he\u2019s shocked, and his surprise answers a couple of questions in my mind: After all these years, is this really the level of understanding of how long-running and far-reaching the rot was and is?

Madison, which granted the Supreme Court judicial review, but agrees when it comes to New Deal legislation.\n\nMatthew Whitaker in Johnston, Iowa, on April 24, 2014. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall/AP)\n\nIn a widely reported 2014 interview, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker criticized Marbury v. Madison, perhaps the most celebrated Supreme Court decision in American history. He also criticized the Court\u2019s decisions upholding important New Deal legislation like the Social Security and Fair Labor Standards Acts. These comments have provoked rebukes of Whitaker\u2019s extremism and ignorance of constitutional law, but almost no one has taken them seriously.\n\nThat is a mistake. At least for the time being, Whitaker is the nation\u2019s highest ranking law enforcement officer. Besides the president and Supreme Court justices, perhaps no federal official wields more power over Americans\u2019 rights and liberties than the attorney general. If Whitaker still holds the views he expressed in 2014, the implications are profoundly troubling.\n\nStart with Marbury v. Madison. This 1803 decision is the canonical source for the Supreme Court\u2019s power to declare federal legislation \u2014 and other governmental acts \u2014 unconstitutional. Although Marbury\u2019s immediate impact on constitutional doctrine was modest, by the early twentieth century, the case had acquired its reputation as the very cornerstone of American constitutional law.\n\nWhitaker's ideas may lead to constitutional crisis\n\nWhitaker\u2019s attack on Marbury was thus an attack on the Supreme Court\u2019s well-established power to authoritatively resolve constitutional disputes.\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker will have the means to put his contempt for the Court into action. First, he could refuse to enforce the decisions of the Supreme Court or other federal courts. Second, he could order the Justice Department, which includes the FBI, to defy court orders in cases that declare its actions unconstitutional. Either would spark a genuine constitutional crisis.\n\nRecall the travel ban cases. Last June, the Supreme Court upheld a revised version of President Trump\u2019s January 2017 order that critics called a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d But the original order was far more punitive and several lower courts immediately barred its enforcement. If Whitaker had been acting attorney general at the time, he might have employed a variation of Andrew Jackson\u2019s apocryphal dictum: \u201cThe courts have made their decision. Now let them enforce it.\u201d\n\nMore: Sessions firing marks end of Mueller deniability for Republicans. Which side are we on?\n\nTrump didn't realize Sessions was helping him by recusing. Now he'll pay for that mistake.\n\nHere are 5 reasons why Matthew Whitaker isn't attorney general material\n\nThe term \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d is often thrown around loosely. But this scenario would meet even the most rigorous definition of the term.\n\nWhitaker\u2019s disdain for the New Deal cases is nearly as alarming. These decisions were the product of the nation\u2019s last great constitutional showdown between Franklin Roosevelt and a Supreme Court bent on hog-tying the federal government in the midst of the Great Depression. Eventually, the Court backed down, upholding the Social Security Act and Fair Labor Standards Act. In the subsequent 80 years, the justices have placed a few modest limits on the outer reaches of federal legislative power, but they have never come close to reconsidering the core of the Court\u2019s New Deal decisions.\n\nThose decisions provide the constitutional foundations for federal laws ranging from the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 and a whole lot more. By attacking them, Whitaker was signaling sympathy with an extreme conservative legal philosophy that views most of the modern federal government as illegitimate and unconstitutional.\n\nWhitaker's judicial review position is incoherent\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker could refuse to defend any or all of these laws against constitutional challenge. This would not be quite as dramatic as defying a court order. Private parties and the soon-to-be Democratic House of Representatives would step in to defend them. But such a refusal would still shake the federal government to its very foundations.\n\nThere is one last, ironic wrinkle. Whitaker\u2019s skepticism of Marbury implies that he believes other branches are better at constitutional interpretation than the Supreme Court. But his rejection of the New Deal cases is actually a call for more aggressive judicial review. This not only makes Whitaker\u2019s position deeply incoherent; it demonstrates his own ineptitude at constitutional analysis, further reinforcing the need for judicial oversight of the executive branch on his watch.\n\nOf course, Whitaker may not act on his dangerous views. Other pressing issues will demand his attention, and the weighty responsibilities of power often temper ill-considered views expressed from the sidelines. Political factors, too, may lead him to chart a more prudent course. Even if they do not, resistance from within the Justice Department and other figures in its senior leadership could well thwart any truly radical designs. Whitaker\u2019s appointment is also temporary, and he may be replaced by a less dangerous figure before he has time to do serious damage.\n\nBut these potential brakes on his extremism are no cause for complacency. The stakes are too high. Whitaker\u2019s appointment is nominally temporary, but federal law allows him to serve for up to 210 days \u2014 and even longer if Trump sends a nomination to the Senate during that period. That is more than enough time to do grave damage.\n\nMost discussion of Whitaker\u2019s appointment has focused on the risk that he will kneecap Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But the threat Whitaker poses to the American constitutional order may run far deeper. The president should immediately withdraw his appointment.\n\nAndrew Coan is a professor of law at the University of Arizona and author of the forthcoming book \"Prosecuting the President: How Special Prosecutors Hold Presidents Accountable and Protect the Rule of Law.\" Toni Massaro is dean emerita and Milton O.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Once upon a time, Jerrod Heard had the \"juice.\"\n\nHe was the quarterback of the future for the Texas Longhorns and he'd just smashed Vince Young's single-game school record with 527 total yards against California. He could throw. He could run. He could do just about everything.\n\nThen all that juice dried up with a whole lot of losing. A fifth-year senior, Heard heads into his final home game this week against No. 18 Iowa State (6-3, 5-2 Big 12) as a fifth-option wide receiver and special teams guy for the No. 13 Longhorns (7-3, 5-2).\n\nBut he's still got the record. And he's earned a whole lot of respect from his teammates for stepping up with a career-high six catches last week against Texas Tech. One of them came in the game-winning touchdown drive.\n\n\"Jerrod's always happy,\" senior defensive end Charles Omenihu said. \"I'm happy for him. He got the opportunity to shine. He's a good soul.\"\n\nHeard's career was supposed to be more than that. On Tuesday, he looked back at what it became and still smiled at the experience.\n\n\"I couldn't ask for a better journey,\" Heard said. \"I've enjoyed every minute of it.\"\n\nOne of the top-rated dual-threat quarterbacks in the nation coming out of high school, Heard was recruited by Mack Brown and stuck with the Longhorns after Brown was fired and Charlie Strong came in. After redshirting for a year while fans called for him to play during a 6-7 season, Strong finally gave him the keys to the offense the second game of 2015.\n\nHe won his first start against Rice, then broke Young's hallowed record which had been set in the classic 2006 Rose Bowl win over Southern California. But even that was tainted just a bit.\n\nHeard scored three times against California, his last one a 45-yard sprint through the middle of the field for what should have been the game-tying touchdown. But kicker Nick Rose missed the extra point. Heard's biggest day as a Longhorn ended as a loss.\n\nHeard had at least pumped some life into the Texas offense. Until two weeks later when Texas got smashed 50-7 at TCU. Even after an upset win over Oklahoma, Texas got shut out at Iowa State. Heard started 10 games at quarterback and Texas finished 5-7. He finished the season on the bench with concussions symptoms.\n\nHis days as a quarterback were done.\n\nBy spring 2016, Strong had revamped his offense and brought in quarterback Shane Buechele. After sitting out that spring with a shoulder injury, Heard was no longer part of the quarterback competition and moved to wide receiver.\n\nHeard probably could have transferred to play quarterback elsewhere. He wasn't that far removed from a stellar high school career that could have landed him just about anywhere.\n\nHe never considered it. Heard wanted to stay at Texas and wanted to win games. He was willing to do it from different positions.\n\n\"I couldn't be down, because I didn't know how many guys I'd bring down with me,\" Heard said. \"I really wanted for this university to win games and be a powerhouse ... I wanted to win a championship. I still think that can happen.\"\n\nHeard's first season at wide receiver was his best when he caught 24 passes and tied for the team lead with three touchdown receptions. But his role kept diminishing as the Texas offense got better. Until last Saturday, he'd caught just three passes for 29 yards this season.\n\nHe was thrust into a big role against Texas Tech because of an ankle injury to Collin Johnson, who has 50 catches for 675 yards and five touchdowns.\n\n\"He was our offensive MVP for the way that he played,\" coach Tom Herman said.\n\nHerman has made sure to keep Heard as a big presence in the locker room, putting him on the team's leadership council. No player has likely felt the highs and lows of a career like he has. The journey of his career has prepared him for challenges beyond football, Heard said.\n\n\"When life brings hardship, I feel very confident in myself (that) I can adjust to it and make it happen,\" Heard said.\n\nHeard has already earned his degree. And he's still got that record over Vince Young.\n\n\"That's a cool thing, to always have that history,\" Heard said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jim Vertuno at https://twitter.com/jimvertuno\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Senior Dexter Williams has been through countless ups and downs during his four years at Notre Dame.\n\nInjury, suspension, an arrest, the emotions of helping his ailing mother \u2014 all of it has weighed down Williams at times. He has emerged just the same as the workhorse running back for the third-ranked Fighting Irish, and a key reason Notre Dame has legitimate hopes of making the playoff.\n\nIn a 42-13 rout of Florida State last week, Williams piled up a career-high 202 yards on just 20 carries, becoming the first running back to surpass 200 rushing yards against the Seminoles since 1982. Nicknamed \"Juice\" by his teammates, he had scoring runs of 58 and 32 yards.\n\n\"I told the offensive line to give me a crease, and I would make a couple of runs for them,\" said Williams, who already this season had touchdown runs of 97 and 31 yards against Virginia Tech and 45 yards against Stanford.\n\nWith four 100-plus yard performances in six games, Williams' per-game rushing average stands at 128.3 yards, which would rank fifth in the country if he had enough games to be included among the NCAA leaders. His 6.8 yards per carry would be 13th. He leads the Irish with 770 yards and 10 touchdowns, exceeding expectations as Notre Dame (10-0) prepares for Saturday's game at Yankee Stadium in New York against No. 12 Syracuse (8-2).\n\n\"His nickname is 'Juice' for a reason,\" said Irish senior wide receiver Miles Boykin. \"His energy is contagious.\"\n\nIt took Williams more than three years \u2014 and through plenty of adversity \u2014 to get to this point.\n\nIn 2016, Williams was one of five Irish players arrested for possession of marijuana during a traffic stop. An injury cost him three straight games in 2017, and he opened this season with a four-game suspension for violating unspecified team rules.\n\n\"Me missing four games, I had a chance to really just settle down and really think about what I wanted as a person,\" said Williams, adding that the depression and guilt he felt from disappointing his teammates was almost unbearable. \"It really just took time and I just had to humble myself to continue to strive for greatness.\"\n\nReflection and maturation helped Williams find his footing, in both school and football. He is expected to graduate next month with his degree in Africana studies.\n\n\"Just growing up in his maturity, ownership and being accountable and responsible,\" coach Brian Kelly said.\n\nBut a mother's love, support and sacrifice were equally as important as anything Williams did on his own. Recognizing that her son was hurting as suspension loomed, Dexter's 60-year-old mother, Cheryl Williams, relocated to South Bend from her home near Orlando, Florida, and moved into an apartment with her son before the season.\n\nMother keeps son on track and well fed. Son watches over mom as she battles two incurable diseases \u2014 myasthenia gravis and pulmonary arterial hypertension, ailments doctors say will take her within the next few years.\n\n\"As much as I can do off the field for her, and just being able to make her happy when I'm playing the game of football, and just having her here has helped me out a lot,\" Dexter Williams said, \"and I'm pretty sure it has helped her a lot too.\"\n\nDexter Williams cherishes every day he shares with his mother, and uses his fresh outlook to lift her spirits and fuel his newfound football success.\n\n\"There is nothing like having a lot of love for your mother,\" Williams said. \"So having her here with me brightens my day.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Ducks won 2-1 in a shootout. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Pekka Rinne is off to an even better start than last season when he finally won the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie, and backup Juuse Saros ranks among the league's top 10 for victories.\n\nWith both goalies now signed to contract extensions, the Nashville Predators may have the best goalie situation both on and off the ice.\n\n\"There's tandems that are much better than others, Nashville has one of them,\" said Martin Biron, a former NHL goalie and now Buffalo broadcaster. \"And I think if you're Peter Laviolette, if you're the goalie coach and the staff, your job and your challenge is to keep them at the highest of levels for the whole season.\"\n\nSo far, the defending Presidents' Trophy winners are doing just that.\n\nThe Predators went into Tuesday night's game in San Jose atop the league standings while also first in the NHL both in goals allowed (37) and 2.12 goals-against per game with Rinne and Saros (7-2-0) splitting the first 18 games. Rinne has been \"ImPekkable\" with a 6-1-1 record, leading all goalies with at least eight starts with a 1.47 goals-against average and .951 save percentage.\n\n\"Every day he is and continues to be the backbone of this organization and team and has probably had the biggest impact on this organization,\" Laviolette said.\n\nRinne is 3-0-1 with a .740 goals-against average and .976 save percentage and a shutout, stopping 121 of 124 shots faced since returning from injured reserve on Oct. 31. The Predators signed Rinne to a two-year extension taking him through 2020-21 on Nov. 3, and the goalie celebrated both the contract and his birthday with his second shutout of the season.\n\nBiron said Tuesday that he doesn't see a big competition for the starting job in Nashville.\n\n\"It's Pekka's job, and Nashville giving him that two-year deal I think is basically saying that 'We want Pekka, and it's going to be like that,'\" Biron said.\n\nRinne has been a Vezina finalist four of the past eight years, making the seven-year, $49 million contract he signed on an earlier birthday in 2011 worth every penny. That deal ties him for the fourth-priciest contract among goalies with Marc-Andre Fleury (33) of Vegas and Boston's Tuukka Rask (31). Fleury is under contract through 2021-22, and Rask hits free agency after the 2020-21 season.\n\nThe Predators signed Rinne to a two-year extension worth $10 million on Nov. 3. General manager David Poile also signed Saros, 23, to a three-year extension in July worth $4.5 million. That means Nashville is projected to drop from seventh with $8.5 million of its salary cap invested in goaltenders to ninth next season with a $6.5 million average annual value, according to Sportrac.com.\n\nRinne could've pushed for more money. Montreal's Carey Price, 31, is getting $10.5 million a year, while Henrik Lundqvist of the Rangers is being paid $8.5 million a year through 2020-21.\n\nBiron calls Rinne one of the hardest-working goalies he's ever seen who's in unbelievable shape. He also sees Rinne simplifying his game as he got older, like Patrick Roy, Dominik Hasek and Eddie Belfour. Rinne still can scramble and react, which Biron thinks will keep Rinne playing at a high level for possibly four more years like Lundqvist.\n\n\"Pekka can play at least through this next contract, and then after that we'll see,\" Biron said.\n\nIt's up to Nashville to make that extra cap space pay off after losing the 2017 Stanley Cup Final in six games and then in seven games in the second round last May. Poile persuaded defenseman Ryan Ellis to take a bit less money with an eight-year deal for $50 million in August, and his next task will be trying to get captain Roman Josi to agree to an extension next summer before the final year on the defenseman's current deal.\n\n\"Hopefully this helps in a way that makes this team stay together moving forward,\" Rinne said. \"I think we have an opportunity to keep this same team. And I think that's David's goal and obviously I like the sound of it. I love this group, and I really think we have a chance this year and years to come.\"\n\nEARLY RETURNS\n\nTom Wilson of the Capitals returned to the lineup Tuesday night at Minnesota after arbitrator Shyam Das reduced the forward's suspension by six games to 14 for his illegal check to the head of St. Louis forward Oskar Sundqvist at the end of the preseason.\n\nHe made an immediate impact, scoring a first-period goal in a 5-2 victory.\n\nNashville forward Austin Watson is eligible to return to the ice Thursday night when the Predators wrap up a road trip in Arizona after Das cut his suspension from 27 games to 18 after he pleaded no contest in July to a domestic assault charge.\n\nDas is the same neutral arbitrator fired by Major League Baseball in 2012 after he overturned Ryan Braun's drug suspension. The NHL fired arbitrator James Oldham in 2016 after his decision to reduce Dennis Wideman's 20-game suspension to 10 for striking and injuring an official, and either the NHL or NHLPA can fire the neutral arbitrator after each season.\n\nNWHL ALL-STAR GAME\n\nThe Predators, who hosted the 2016 NHL All-Star Game, will be hosting the 2019 NWHL All-Star Weekend capped by an NHL-NWHL doubleheader on Feb. 10. This is the third straight year the NWHL has held its All-Star Weekend in an NHL market, starting with Pittsburgh in 2017 and Minnesota in 2018.\n\nNashville will host St. Louis with a morning faceoff, and fans will be invited to stick around for the NWHL All-Star Game starting soon after the NHL matinee. The All-Star game will feature a pair of 25-minute halves with Shannon Szabados, goalie for the Buffalo Beauts and a three-time Olympian with Canada, captain of one team and Minnesota defender Lee Stecklein, a U.S. Olympic gold medalist in February, captain of the other team.\n\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n\nPatrick Marleau and the Toronto Maple Leafs visit his old team in San Jose on Thursday night with Erik Karlsson still settling in with the Sharks.\n\nLEADERS (through Tuesday)\n\nGoals: David Pastrnak (Boston), 16; Assists: Mikko Rantanen (Colorado), 20; Points: Mikko Rantanen, (Colorado), and Connor McDavid, (Edmonton), 26; Wins: Frederik Andersen (Toronto), 10; Goals-against average: Pekka Rinne (Nashville), 1.47; Save percentage: Pekka Rinne (Nashville), .951.\n\n___\n\nAP Hockey Writer John Wawrow contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Teresa M.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFor decades, the NFL has had a strong bond with the military. That relationship stretches far beyond the pregame and halftime ceremonies that honor veterans, and particularly ratchets up in November with the league's Salute To Service.\n\nThis year, the NFL and the Bob Woodruff Foundation have partnered to find and grant funds to organizations helping former military members. So far, 38 organizations have received grants, some in the spring and others this fall.\n\n\"One of the things we have come across are just an unbelievable amount of nonprofit organizations working to support the veteran and military community,\" says Anna Isaacson, the NFL's senior vice president of social responsibility. \"There are some reports of 40,000 such organizations.\n\n\"We hear from these organizations and we want to help every one we can, but that is sometimes difficult. The commissioner had a relationship with the Bob Woodruff Foundation and learned about the process they go through to determine which organizations should receive grants, and that there could be an awesome partnership as a grant referral pipeline. They can take our salute dollars and put them to use with the organizations doing the most impactful work in this landscape.\"\n\nThe Woodruff Foundation was founded in 2006 after reporter Woodruff was hit by a roadside bomb while covering the war in Iraq. Its $2 million affiliation with the NFL bolsters the grant work done by the foundation.\n\n\"We have now been through ... basically a whole year of granting with the NFL,\" says Dr. Margaret Harrell, the director of programs and partnerships for BWF. \"The Woodruff Foundation brings our expertise to help the NFL select the most effective and important programs that are serving the post-911 veteran population. It's a really nice partnership to ensure an increasing number of veterans benefit around the country.\n\n\"There hasn't been a huge learning curve because it's been such a delightfully smooth partnership; we have a shared interest.\"\n\nAdds Isaacson: \"This came together in our world somewhat quickly. There already are (22) organizations receiving a grant from the NFL and BWF, and some organizations we may not have partnered with have had the opportunity to engage in a partnership.\"\n\nOne of those groups is the Furniture Bank of Atlanta, a relatively small local company with a full-time staff of 11 that received a grant in October. Furniture Bank serves about 40 families a week, providing furniture to veterans and others who had been homeless and have now found a place to live. A bed for each person, plus tables, chairs, a sofa, a dresser \u2014 as many as 14 pieces, mostly used, that have been donated to the company \u2014 are supplied.\n\nBut the group takes it several steps further for those vets. It puts them to work .\n\nSome of the former military members become interns and load and unload Furniture Bank trucks. Others who show the initiative and know-how can become drivers, which allows the bank to increase its delivery schedules.\n\n\"Before we had the program, we had the idea to start an internship for someone who is homeless, help them to get a license (to drive a box truck),\" says Megan Anderson, executive director of Furniture Bank of Atlanta. \"We realized in 2014 we could expand that and the internship was a good fit with our warehouse and trucks. We had United Way seed money, and could take on 10 to 12 veterans who had to be homeless or just moving into housing.\n\n\"They work on our trucks for eight weeks, get a small stipend ... and then can go the warehouse route and get certified or get their license to drive the trucks.\"\n\nAnderson stresses that the folks they are helping are motivated to help themselves . After all, they served in the military, where motivation is a given stimulus.\n\n\"One thing we noticed, more recently out of the military members especially, is they are hard working, punctual, and have a strong appreciation for teamwork,\" she says. \"A lot of teamwork is involved here. They certainly can work as a unit. We also found multiple veterans have that camaraderie and help encourage each other.\n\n\"Maybe someone is homeless and another veteran just got an apartment, and another has a job. If someone has been homeless a while, they are pretty hopeless to some extent. Maybe they have bad luck with employment or have not been treated well, and they lose trust. It helps to see others who have succeeded.\"\n\nAnderson is certain the affiliation between the NFL and BWF has helped her group and will help others who apply for the grants. She emphasizes how easy the application process is on the NFL or BWF website, as does Harrell.\n\n\"From our perspective, the partnership between the Bob Woodruff Foundation and the NFL made applying to the foundation and getting the grant seem more accessible for a local and small organization,\" Anderson says. \"That is how we learned about this opportunity and it seemed more feasible, and it was OK that we were just working in Atlanta, which I thought was cool.\"\n\nHarrell notes that the public could get the wrong impression that all veterans are struggling when they make the transition from the military; that's far from accurate. But the work done by Furniture Bank of Atlanta is essential.\n\n\"The group Furniture Bank is serving is a group that has considerable challenges in their post-military lives,\" she explains. \"The organization gives these individuals the benefit of the doubt and works with them on an individual basis, provides them with credentials for the future, and keeps them on board long enough for Furniture Bank to vouch for them as an employee.\"\n\nShe offers a reminder to those groups that have applied but not received NFL/BWF grants that they won't be forgotten. Of the roughly 200 that BWF expects will submit a proposal, the foundation requests a further proposal from around 30 to 40 submissions, although it will engage in feedback with all 200.\n\n\"There is no set number of grants or a set grant amount,\" she says. \"It depends on the need and scope of the program and the level we can handle.

One thing is for sure, LSU's ranking is head scratching. USA TODAY\n\nOklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione stands on the field before the school's game against Ohio State in 2016. (Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe good news is the leftovers. When committee members leave the Bluebonnet Boardroom, they routinely make a beeline to the buffet table, where a breakfast item has been left out at their request.\n\nClemson athletic director Dan Radakovich, who served on the College Football Playoff selection committee from 2014-17, recalls \u201cthe best bacon any of us had ever had \u2013 so we\u2019d nibble on it while we were outside.\u201d And understand, Radakovich was outside a lot. Whenever Clemson was discussed \u2013 and given the Tigers\u2019 performances these last few years, this happened often \u2013 Radakovich was asked to leave the boardroom because of the playoff\u2019s recusal policy.\n\nHe would get some work done for his day job. If necessary, he\u2019d do some last-minute homework on the remaining teams to be discussed and ranked. And yeah, he\u2019d wonder what was being said inside the room.\n\n\u201cThe bacon tray was always remaining,\u201d Radakovich says, \u201cso that was a positive.\u201d\n\nWe bring this up because even on a week when the top 10 did not change at all \u2013 we know, they bring a clean sheet of paper and rank teams as though the season was over and they had not ranked them a week earlier \u2013 there was likely plenty of discussion of teams\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. And that meant for at least part of the meeting, two committee members had to leave the room.\n\nWhen the committee discussed Oklahoma, or voted on the group of teams Oklahoma was bunched with, Joe Castiglione was banished to that very nice holding room. That's as it should be; as Oklahoma\u2019s athletic director, he\u2019s recused from anything related to his school. But Frank Beamer, the retired Virginia Tech coach whose son Shane Beamer is an Oklahoma assistant coach, joined him.\n\nPresumably they ate bacon and traded small talk. What they did not do was participate in anything regarding Oklahoma \u2013 creating a situation in which discussions and debates involving the team currently ranked No. 6 is conducted with only 11 of 13 committee members.\n\nHow does that impact the way the rankings sausage gets made?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had two or more recusals in the past, and it just hasn\u2019t been an issue at all,\u201d says Bill Hancock, the College Football Playoff\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe still have plenty of really good football people in the room.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s right about both. In 2015 and 2016, both Condoleezza Rice and Tyrone Willingham were recused from discussions and votes involving Stanford. And it was not ultimately an issue, at least not as it relates to the four-team bracket.\n\nThe Cardinal finished No. 6 in the final rankings in 2015, but with two losses was not a significant part of the debate for the No. 4 slot (Stanford finished 18th and was not part of the conversation in 2016).\n\nOklahoma ranks No. 6 for the second consecutive week, but will factor into a discussion over the No. 4 slot if it continues to win. There has been much debate nationally about the Sooners\u2019 defensive struggles \u2013 Is this team, even with perhaps the nation\u2019s most explosive offense, fit for the playoff with that defense? \u2013 and you\u2019d better believe that same conversation is being had by the people who\u2019ll actually make that decision in less than three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe talk about Oklahoma in total,\u201d says selection committee chairman Rob Mullens, the Oregon athletic director. \u201cSo we look at their whole resume, and you start off by saying they\u2019re 9-1, and their only loss is to a Texas team at a neutral site in a very close game. But as you dig deeper, you see a great quarterback, one of the top offenses in the country with a lot of playmakers, but you also notice particularly in the last two weeks that the defense has struggled and that their offense is carrying them. That\u2019s all part of the discussion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s what you figured Mullens would say, because the goal is not to say much. But clearly, Oklahoma\u2019s defense is and should be a very big part of the discussion. And it might very well be the factor that prevents the Sooners, even if they win out, from getting into the bracket.\n\nIt might also be exactly the right call.\n\nBut it\u2019s unfortunate the discussion and vote is being conducted with only 11 of 13 members.\n\nThe recusal policy is a very good thing; it eliminates concern about the integrity of the process. Selection committee members literally check their hats at the door to the boardroom before each meeting, signifying their intent to shed allegiances.\n\nBut Castiglione should not be allowed to discuss or rank his school. Neither should Gene Smith, Ohio State\u2019s athletic director, discuss or rank the Buckeyes. (The other recusals for the 2018 season: Paola Boivin, Arizona State; Herb Deromedi, Central Michigan; Scott Stricklin, Florida; Todd Stansbury, Georgia Tech; Mullens, Oregon; Jeff Bower, Southern Mississippi. All are allowed to answer \u201cfactual questions\u201d about those schools, but can\u2019t be present during discussions or votes.)\n\nIt certainly might be better for Oklahoma if the Big 12\u2019s representative athletic director on the selection committee was from, say, Baylor or Iowa State or even Texas (Castiglione replaced Texas Tech\u2019s Kirby Hocutt) \u2013 but them\u2019s the breaks, and it\u2019s too bad for Oklahoma.\n\nBut losing Beamer\u2019s voice, as well, could change things in incalculable ways. Beamer is recused from Virginia Tech, of course. Last year, he was also recused from Georgia, where his son was an assistant. But when Shane became an assistant at Oklahoma during the offseason, his father was recused from Oklahoma (and he can now discuss Georgia all he wants).\n\nWho knows how that alters the discussion? It\u2019s possible Beamer, as an old-school coach, would say, \u201cthat defense is terrible,\u201d and indicate that there\u2019s no way the Sooners should be in the mix. But there\u2019s no real way to know. On a committee of 13, a strong missing voice could be significant; two votes not being cast one way or another even moreso.\n\nAs you might imagine, Hancock says it\u2019s not a problem. But it\u2019s an interesting thing to ponder as we consider the possible turmoil in a few weeks over which teams should make the final bracket.\n\nMullens declined Tuesday to estimate how much time the committee spent this week discussing Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I could put a stopwatch on the amount of time we spent,\u201d Mullens says, \u201cbut I can tell you it\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Radakovich says he\u2019s not sure how long his temporary exiles lasted \u2013 though as it got later in the season, nearer to the final set of rankings, they lengthened. He\u2019d be out of the boardroom for a half-hour, and sometimes longer.\n\n\u201cYou know that you have many, many good reasons for the people that are directly related to an organization not to be in the room,\u201d Radakovich says. \u201cI absolutely understand that. But you do a lot of the same work as everyone else. There were times, because of (Clemson\u2019s) success \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world \u2013 that I felt like I missed some of the more interesting discussions. \u2026 I was very happy to be out of the room because it meant (Clemson was) involved at a high level.\u201d\n\nBut those extended absences from the discussion and debate led inevitably to one other concerning issue.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any bacon left,\u201d Radakovich says. \u201cIf I was out that long, I\u2019d eat all the bacon.\u201d", "", "", "MOSCOW, Idaho (AP) \u2014 Gavin Peppers scored seven of his 21 points in the final seconds as Nicholls held off Idaho 83-80 on Tuesday night.\n\nIdaho's Cameron Tyson nailed a 3-pointer to close to 76-75 with 30 seconds remaining.

The Los Angeles Kings do not.\n\nAnd when the Leafs hit the Staples Center ice in full flight, the Kings were caught a bit flat-footed.\n\nNazem Kadri scored two power-play goals and John Tavares had a goal and two assists in the Maple Leafs' 5-1 victory Tuesday night.\n\nMorgan Rielly and Andreas Johnsson also scored in the Leafs' fourth win in five games overall and their seventh win in eight road games this season. Frederik Andersen made 22 saves as Toronto's burgeoning powerhouse swept its two-game season series with NHL-worst Los Angeles by a combined 9-2.\n\n\"We were moving our feet from the start,\" said Toronto's Mitch Marner, who had two assists despite needing a few stitches after Alex Iafallo's stick hit him in the mouth in the second period. \"We drew penalties with our speed. That's something we haven't done (much) this year. Our whole team came out ready to play, and we made it hard on their (defense).\"\n\nToronto opened a three-game California road swing with another dominant performance, leading 2-0 just 6:12 in and getting 11 shots on net before Los Angeles got its first. The Maple Leafs scored three power-play goals and continued their impressive start to the season despite the continued absence of holdout William Nylander and star Auston Matthews, who missed his seventh straight game with a shoulder injury.\n\nKadri said the Leafs dominated \"by being fast. I think that's the identity of our team, and we wanted to use it to our advantage.\"\n\nTavares scored a goal in his third consecutive game, connecting on the power play in the first period for his 11th goal of the season. The star forward already has 22 points in 18 games during his debut season with his hometown team.\n\n\"(Tavares) has been great,\" said Rielly, who leads all NHL defensemen with 23 points after getting a goal and an assist. \"We're 18 games in, and he's been outstanding. He's been a leader. He's been a 200-foot player. He's been putting the puck in the net.\"\n\nAdrian Kempe scored for the Kings, who have lost three straight while scoring just two combined goals since winning their debut under interim coach Willie Desjardins last week. The NHL's lowest-scoring team went 3-4-0 on a seven-game homestand.\n\n\"We've got to pull our stuff together here quickly and win some games,\" Los Angeles captain Anze Kopitar said. \"We've been talking for a while now. If we don't get our minds to it and actually get it done on the ice, it doesn't mean anything.\"\n\nJohnsson's goal early in the second period put Toronto up 4-1 and chased Peter Budaj, who stopped 15 shots. He was replaced by Cal Petersen, who stopped 15 shots in his NHL debut.\n\nThe Kings are down to their top two AHL goalies after Jack Campbell joined Jonathan Quick on injured reserve this week with torn meniscuses in their knees.\n\n\"I was a little surprised\" to get put in the game, Petersen said. \"I didn't hear the coach right away. It was an exciting moment, and I got to face a shot right away, which helped. I was just trying not to make it bigger than it is.\"\n\nBut even LA's normally sturdy penalty-killing units struggled against Toronto, giving up multiple power-play goals for only the second time this season.\n\nKempe ended his 12-game goalless streak with a first-period deflection, but Rielly put Toronto up 3-1 early in the second after two Leafs converged on Kings defenseman Drew Doughty and forced a turnover.\n\nJohnsson then scored after four Kings stood and watched while Travis Dermott skated the puck from the point to the net for a pass.\n\nKadri connected again late in the second period for his fourth goal in four games and his seventh in nine games.\n\nNOTES: Dermott scored his first point since Toronto's season opener. ...

Only two unlikely cities expressed final interest, with Beijing, China, winning narrowly in an IOC vote over Almtay, Kazakhstan.\n\n\"(The vote) comes as no surprise following the political discussions and uncertainties right up until the last few days,\" the IOC said in a statement. \"It is disappointing that the arguments about the sporting, social and long-term benefits of hosting the Olympic Games did not sway the vote.\"\n\nThe host for 2026 will be selected by the IOC in a vote on June 24 in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee said in a statement it was disappointed by the results. Calgary was the host for the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\n\"The opportunity to welcome the world to Canada, where people can experience the uniting power of the Games and within our nation's culture of peace and inclusion, would have offered countless benefits to all,\" the statement said. \"This would have been a unique opportunity for Canadians to be leaders in fulfilling the promise of a renewed vision for the Games.\"\n\nThe results won't be declared official until Friday. But the opposition was already celebrating.\n\n\"I think that people had enough of the establishment, telling us what to do, what to think,\" local councilor Sean Chu said.\n\nMary Moran, CEO of Calgary 2026, called the issue \"very divisive\" and said it was time \"to put that behind us.\"\n\n\"We really wanted this dream for Calgary to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games,\" Moran said. \"We learned so much about our community. We learned so much about each other.\"\n\nThe Alberta government made its funding of a bid conditional on holding a vote and provided $2 million to pay for it.\n\n\"We fought many, many obstacles along the way,\" said Scott Hutcheson, board chair of Calgary 2026. \"We had three government partners that stepped up with billions of dollars to invest in this dream.\"\n\nCalgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi voted for continuing with a bid. Calgary 2026 was hampered by last-minute negotiations over a cost-sharing agreement between the federal, provincial and city governments.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It\u2019s not the first time the genre has managed to make waves politically. USA TODAY\n\nBTS (Photo: STEVE GRANITZ/WIREIMAGE)\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2013 The agency for K-pop superstars BTS apologized Wednesday for members wearing a T-shirt depicting the explosion of an atomic bomb and a hat with a Nazi emblem.\n\nJapanese TV broadcasters recently cancelled planned appearances in that country after images went viral of the musician wearing the shirt. The South Korean band ran into more trouble after news surfaced that another member wore a hat featuring a Nazi symbol in a magazine photo book and band members flew flags with what appeared to be the Nazi swastika during a past concert.\n\n\"We would like to again offer our sincerest apologies to anyone who has suffered pain, distress and discomfort due to our shortcomings and oversight in ensuring that these matters receive our most careful attention,\" the band's agency, the Big Hit Entertainment, said in a statement\n\nThe T-shirt portrayed an atomic bombing juxtaposed with the celebration of Korea's 1945 liberation from Japan at the end of the World War II.

Many in both Koreas still harbor strong resentment against the Japanese colonial masters.

A Marine spokesman says his unit was sent to help support the southern border.

(Photo: Rodrigo Abd, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A California National Guard soldier has been charged with human trafficking after he was arrested near San Diego over the weekend, as the Pentagon's military buildup at the Southwest border continues.\n\nEdward Jair Acosta-Avila was charged in federal court with attempting to smuggle three Mexican men into the United States, according to court documents. Acosta-Avila is a private in the California Army National Guard, according to Air Force Lt. Col. Thomas Keegan, a spokesman there.\n\nAcosta-Villa was pending discharge for being absent without leave (AWOL) at the time of his arrest, Keegan said.\n\nNews of the arrest of an American soldier for human trafficking comes on the eve of the visit of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to the southwest border. President Donald Trump has ordered as many as 7,000 active-duty U.S. troops to California, Arizona and Texas as a show of force against caravans of migrants from Central America.\n\nMattis is expected to visit with the troops and observe their operations. Critics, including former President Barack Obama, have called the deployment of active-duty troop a political stunt. Mattis has rejected that characterization.\n\nThe first group of migrants arrived Tuesday. Trump repeatedly railed against the migrants in the run up to last week's midterm election in which Democrats seized control of the House. Trump has said little about them since.\n\nSo far, about 5,000 active-duty troops have been deployed to the border, joining about 2,100 National Guard soldiers who have been assisting Border Patrol agents. They have been stringing concertina wire at ports of entry into the United States and providing other logistical support.\n\nThe soldiers were supposed to help agents prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally. Instead, Private First Class Acosta-Avila hoped to profit from smuggling them past authorities, according to court documents. Acosta-Avila had not been assigned to border duty, Keegan said.\n\nOn Saturday, a Border Patrol agent stopped a Honda Accord driven by Acosta-Avila about two miles north of the border, according to a criminal complaint. Three men in the back seat tried to hide beneath a blanket.\n\nAcosta-Avila told authorities that another man had asked him to drive to the area near the border to pick up some people near the border. Acosta-Avila's friend and co-defendant told authorities that he planned to split $400 with him for sneaking the three Mexican men into the United States.\n\nThe Mexican men told authorities that they \"made smuggling arrangements and agreed to pay between $6,000 and $7,000 each to smuggled into the United States.\"\n\nAcosta-Avila was charged with transportation of certain aliens for financial gain. His attorney could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/13/awol-national-guard-solider-charged-human-trafficking-border/1996285002/", "The LG C8 OLED is one of the best deals of Black Friday 2018 (Photo: LG)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need.

Oshie in the first period of an NHL hockey game Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018, in St. Paul, Minn. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 The Washington Capitals woke up in Minnesota for the start of a four-game road trip with a pleasant surprise: Tom Wilson was back.\n\nSo was the vigor for the Stanley Cup champions, who've started their title-defense season rather slowly.\n\nWilson returned early from his player-safety suspension and scored a first-period goal, helping the Capitals cool off the Wild with a 5-2 victory on Tuesday night.\n\n\"He's a key player for our team. Brings so much energy both on the ice and off the ice, so a huge lift for the team to get him back,\" said Andre Burakovsky, who had a goal and an assist.\n\nDmitry Orlov had his first two goals of the season and an assist, T.J. Oshie also scored and backup goalie Pheonix Copley made 26 saves for the Capitals, who welcomed Wilson back to the right wing on the first line with captain Alex Ovechkin and center Evgeny Kuznetsov. An arbitrator's reduction of Wilson's 20-game ban for an illegal blindside hit to the head in a preseason game made him immediately eligible again.\n\n\"It was a good game by the fellas, and it felt good to put together a good 60 minutes,\" Wilson said. \"Hopefully we can get this thing going a little.\"\n\nMikko Koivu and Matt Dumba had goals for the Wild, who played at home for the first time in 17 days after a 5-2 finish on their franchise-record seven-game road swing. They fell to 5-1-2 at Xcel Energy Center, becoming the last team in the NHL to lose at home in regulation this season.\n\n\"You get spoiled. They weren't as good as they were for the last 12 games,\" said coach Bruce Boudreau, whose club was 10-2 over the previous four weeks.\n\nThe Wild have given up the first goal in 13 of their 18 games, though they entered the night tied for the best record in the league in those situations at 8-3-1. Orlov's snap shot scraped the crossbar and found the back of the upper right corner just 6:33 into the game.\n\nThen Orlov, who was recently split up with usual blue-line partner Matt Niskanen in an attempt by first-year coach Todd Reirden to seek a spark amid the sluggish start, set up Wilson in his season debut. Orlov maneuvered around Dumba and fed Wilson for a one-timer with 27.4 seconds left before the first intermission .\n\nRyan Suter was chasing Wilson, who was caught between the defenseman and Devan Dubnyk in a collision that knocked the Wild goalie to the ice and left him down and dazed for a moment. Wilson picked up a goaltender interference penalty while scoring the goal. He was second in the NHL in penalty minutes last season.\n\n\"The puck went in the net before he touched the goalie, so there wasn't much you could do about it,\" Boudreau said. \"That's the way he plays.\"\n\nEric Staal thought he had a goal for the Wild early in the second period, but that was waved off because he kicked the puck, one of several near-misses for the Wild. Instead, Burakovsky scored soon after for a 3-0 lead. Suter and Dumba, the first blue-line pair, were on the ice for each of the first three goals.\n\n\"It didn't look like we were connecting very well, and some of the mental mistakes we made are going to cost you against a good offensive team,\" Staal said.\n\nThe Wild went a whopping 14:03 without a shot on goal, until Staal's wrist shot was stopped by Copley. Koivu's backhander trickled through Copley's pads to put the Wild on the board about a minute later, and Marcus Foligno tried to keep the momentum going by dropping the gloves and fighting Wilson. The Wild had 22 of their 28 shots in the second half of the game, but they just couldn't convert enough of those chances.\n\nWilson just finished serving his fourth suspension in a little more than a year, this for a blindside hit to the head of an opponent during a preseason game . His presence gave Washington's lagging penalty kill a boost.\n\n\"I didn't expect him to have as strong a game as he did,\" Rierden said.\n\nDumba's goal was the only tally for Minnesota in six power-play opportunities. The Capitals, who entered the night ranked third-worst in the league on the penalty kill, allowed six power-play goals over their previous four games.\n\nNOTES: This was the eighth straight win by the Capitals over the Wild, whose last win in the series was at Washington on March 5, 2015. All but one of the victories by the Capitals during the streak have come in regulation. ... This was the third two-goal game of Orlov's 382-game career. ... Staal has 30 goals and 44 assists in 77 career games against the Capitals, his most points against any other team. ... With his 341st career goal, Parise passed Dave Christian to become the leading scorer among Minnesota-born players in NHL history. ... Dubnyk stopped 28 shots.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCapitals: Play at Winnipeg on Wednesday.\n\nWild: Host Pacific Division-leading Vancouver on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She has stood out as one of the most forceful voices in favor of WADA taking a harder line against Russia since revelations of the doping scandal inside the country that tainted the Sochi Olympics.\n\nScott did not respond to voicemail and text messages left by AP.\n\n\"In short, the world realized that if a person of this unchallengeable integrity and character could feel bullied, belittled, disrespected and marginalized,\" Moses wrote of Scott, \"that something is potentially seriously amiss with the way business at WADA is being conducted.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

It (stinks) when you don't score,\" he said. \"Sometimes it happens. It happened today. For us, forget this game as soon as possible and move forward.\"\n\nThe Sabres limited the NHL's top offense to one goal after Tampa Bay had scored four or more in each of its past five games.\n\nSkinner opened the scoring with 2:15 left in the first period, when he was parked in front and converted a rebound after Domingue stopped Sam Reinhart's shot from the top of the right circle.\n\nThe Sabres somehow matched the Lightning in scoring one goal apiece in the second period despite being outshot 14-2.\n\nHutton held the fort in making numerous clutch stops starting from the opening minute, when he foiled Stamkos driving in alone across the front.\n\nOkposo put Buffalo up 2-0 at the 5:43 mark of the period when he used defender Victor Hedman as a screen and scored on a low shot from the right circle that fooled Domingue.\n\nThe Lightning responded 15 seconds later, when Alex Killorn flipped a pass from his own blue line and over two Sabres defenders, including a leaping Rasmus Dahlin. The puck landed on the stick of Cirelli, who scored on a breakaway by beating Hutton high on the glove side.\n\nThe Sabres' three-game winning streak is their second of the season. Buffalo won three straight just once a year ago, when the team finished last in the NHL standings for the third time in five seasons.\n\nThough relieved to pull out the win, Okposo said the Sabres were too passive in trying to nurse the one-goal lead.\n\n\"We were on our heels a little too much,\" he said. \"We weren't sharp. We've got to clean up some stuff. I know we've won the last three games, but we probably only played real good for a period and a half.\"\n\nOkposo then laughed when asked if he would've complained after a three-game winning streak last season.\n\n\"Yeah, probably not,\" he said. \"But our standard's higher this year.\"\n\nNOTES: Lightning D Erik Cernak made his NHL debut after being called up from Syracuse of the AHL earlier in the day.

The mysterious feud seems to have an unlikely start.

She encouraged people to choose \"kindness over hatred.\" She spoke before addressing an event about the opioid crisis in the East Room of the White House. (Photo: JIM LO SCALZO/EPA-EFE)\n\nWASHINGTON - Melania Trump's unexpected feud with a national security official exploded Tuesday when the first lady publicly called for the official's firing.\n\nThe quarrel between the first lady and deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel apparently began during a trip Trump took to Africa last month. Two officials told USA TODAY that Ricardel argued with Trump's staff over airplane seating for the first lady's trip.\n\nThey accused Ricardel, who wound up not going to Africa, of spreading false stories about the incident. The officials said Ricardel had clashed with other staff members as well.\n\nBut on Tuesday, more than a month after the trip, the feud became very public when the first lady released a statement saying Ricardel should be fired.\n\n\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she (Ricardel) no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\" said a statement from Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's communications director.\n\nMore: First Lady Melania Trump has never met the security official she wants fired: official\n\nHere's a little more about Ricardel, taken from previous USA TODAY reporting, statements from the Trump administration, her resume on LinkedIn and comments she made to Congress during a Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nRicardel's roots with the Trump administration go back to the president's transition team, before he took office. Over the years, she's served in three administrations and held a variety of roles in different government agencies, including in the Commerce, State and Defense departments.\n\nHer high-profile roles in Washington go back to a stint at the State Department in the 1980s and later as a legislative assistant for Republicans in the Senate. Ricardel also worked on Sen. Bob Dole's failed presidential campaign in 1996.\n\nThe two appeared to remain close over the years, though, and Ricardel mentioned Dole's role in mentoring her during a Congressional testimony last year.\n\nUnder former President George W. Bush, Ricardel worked in the Defense Department as a deputy assistant secretary for defense in Eurasia after the September 11 attacks, serving a major role in the region and helping coordinate where troops and other assets would be stationed.\n\nShe also has extensive experience in the private sector, working for Boeing for more about a decade before joining the president's team.\n\nAfter helping on President Donald Trump's transition, she served as a special assistant to the president before the president nominated her last year as undersecretary for export administration in the Commerce Department.\n\nShe wasn't in the role for long. Ricardel was nabbed by National security adviser John Bolton when he came into the role earlier this year and was appointed his No. 2.\n\nCLOSE First lady Melania Trump says she could be \"the most bullied person\" in the world, judging by \"what people are saying about me.\" (Oct. 11) AP\n\n\"I selected her as Deputy National Security Advisor because her expertise is broad-based and includes national security matters related to our alliances, defense posture, technology security, foreign security assistance, and arms control,\" Bolton said in a statement at the time.\n\nRicardel's roots include Europe. Her father was an immigrant who ended up in the United States after leaving Croatia.\n\nShe talked about him in Congressional testimony last year, telling senators her late-father came to America with \"little more than optimism in his pockets.\"\n\n\"He was always optimistic about what was possible in this great Nation--a view that carried him from communist-controlled Croatia via Germany to the United States,\" she said during testimony for a Commerce Department role.\n\nRicardel graduated from Georgetown University and completed her doctoral studies at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nPoor field conditions at Estadio Azteca forced the NFL to move Monday night's Chiefs-Rams game to Los Angeles. (Photo: Christian Palma, AP)\n\nWhat a mess, NFL.\n\nAnd just think: It could have been way worse.\n\nThe quick decision by the league on Tuesday to bolt from Mexico City \u2014 scrapping the threat of a potential disaster \u2014 wasn\u2019t really much of a choice.\n\nImagine if Todd Gurley or Patrick Mahomes tore up a knee while sliding around on a sloppy field at Estadio Azteca on Monday night.\n\nOr if Jared Goff, Tyreek Hill and Aaron Donald simply refused to play.\n\nNo, the no-brainer decision to move the \u201cmidseason Super Bowl\u201d between the Rams and the Chiefs to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was essentially made for the NFL, in consultation with the NFL Players Association, when transposed against the integrity of the game and safety of the players.\n\nThere\u2019s no wiggle room there. The NFL, with a litany of bruises to its image in recent years, couldn\u2019t dare risk the possibility of blowing this one after it became apparent that the field conditions were atrocious.\n\nYet it makes you wonder: A little more than two years since horrendous field conditions forced the cancellation of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game in Canton, Ohio, how could the NFL even come close to staging a game at a stadium with a shoddy field.\n\nI\u2019m guessing someone checked the schedule and figured the Shakira concert couldn\u2019t be an issue. The concert was on Oct. 11 \u2014 five weeks before Chiefs-Rams. But reportedly, the concert left the natural grass field shambles. Add a few soccer games and apparently too much rain to the mix, and it comes to this different type of audible.\n\nThe particular venue in Mexico City, by the way, is notorious for its turf issues. Sure, the Patriots and Raiders played there last season without a blip, but people who closely follow soccer know the reputation that now has a fresh chapter.\n\nHere\u2019s to contingency plans. And a quick about-face ... to avoid egg-on-face.\n\nAs reports and the turf-monster photos circulated early on Tuesday to document the crisis, the NFL stood firm in declaring that it planned for the show to go on. Given the NFL\u2019s ability to turn wheels in a pinch, it seemed plausible. (Quick, get George Toma on a jet. Toma might be 89, but he\u2019s only semi-retired, having worked the last Super Bowl).\n\nThink again. Despite the work that began to re-sod the field, the plug was pulled later on Tuesday.\n\nNo need to risk having the Rams and Chiefs hit the field for pregame warmups, only to discover that the surface wasn\u2019t of NFL quality after all. Besides, rush jobs tend to escalate risk.\n\nRemember, the Hall of Fame Game? That fiasco in 2016, days after a concert, included a sticky surface caused by the painting for logos and markers. On that night, the NFL tried to wait it out, failing to quickly cancel the game while fans in the stadium bought concessions and souvenirs, thinking they were set to ultimately see the \u201cB team\u201d versions of the Packers and Colts.\n\nIn this case, there won\u2019t even be a temptation to force it.\n\nOne of the hard lessons that the league took from Canton revolved around outsourcing field management services that contributed to the issues. At this point, it\u2019s unclear how the field management services were handled in Mexico City.\n\nBut another takeaway from Canton was the pledge by the NFL and NFLPA to seek better methods for testing the quality of fields. As questions about field conditions ramped up this week, the NFLPA dispatched a field inspector to Mexico City.\n\nYet by the time the inspector arrived on Tuesday, the game \u2014 which was designated as a Rams home game \u2014 was already switched to L.A.\n\nThe ramifications could be significant for the NFL\u2019s efforts on the international stage. It\u2019s one more reason for coaches or other detractors from teams to loathe games in non-NFL stadiums. And given the plans that just went awry for fans who pegged Mexico City as a \u201cdestination game,\u201d just think of the costs that are sure to come in settling legal issues that will flow from this.\n\nAt least the big game will go on \u2014 1,500 miles away.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

The Devils won 4-2. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEWARK, N.J. (AP) \u2014 Taylor Hall gave the New Jersey Devils just what they needed after a dismal seven-game trip \u2014 an MVP-type performance.\n\nHall scored the game-winning goal on a breakaway at 8:07 of the third period added an empty-net tally to cap a four-point night and lead the Devils to a 4-2 victory over the struggling Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night.\n\nTravis Zajac and Damon Severson each had a goal and an assist as the Devils snapped a three-game losing streak by beating the Penguins for the second time in just over a week. Keith Kinkaid had 29 saves for New Jersey, which was returning home after a 1-6 trip.\n\n\"Not just a win but an effort we can be proud of,\" said Hall, last season's MVP. \"It's not an effort where we solely relied on our goaltender to steal a game. We did a good job of eliminating chances against a high-powered team. Our game has to continue to grow that way and when we play strong in our end, it allows us to just play more free up the ice and create more, have the puck more. It was solid night for us.\"\n\nPhil Kessel and Jake Guentzel scored for the Penguins, who have one win in seven games (1-5-1). Casey DeSmith had 31 saves in his third straight start.\n\n\"It's frustrating because we are trying to find wins right now and we can't seem to find them with any level of consistency,\" Penguins coach Mike Sulllivan said. \"I thought we had spurts in the game where we were good, then some of the goals they scored, we didn't force them to work hard enough for them. That for me is discouraging.\"\n\nHall's game-winner came a little less than four minutes after Guentzel tied the game. It came on a quick counterattack. Kyle Palmieri sent a pass from the Devils' defensive end to Zajac at the Penguins' blue line. Zajac sent a pass to Hall coming down the middle, and last year's MVP made one move and slid a soft shot between DeSmith's legs.\n\n\"He called for it,\" Zajac said of the pass to Hall. \"I kind of saw him, but he called for it and I just had to kind of whack it over to him and he made a great play.\"\n\nDeSmith was clearly frustrated after the play. He seemed to read Hall's move and felt he got a piece of the puck.\n\n\"We had worked hard to tie it up and like I said, the team needed a save and I didn't make it in that situation. I feel responsible for that,\" DeSmith said.\n\nThe Devils, who are 6-1-1 at home, took leads of 1-0 and 2-1 only to see the Penguins tie it.\n\nGuentzel's sixth goal of the season tied the game at 2 after withstanding a challenge by New Jersey coach John Hynes, who claimed Sidney Crosby interfered with Kinkaid.\n\nKinkaid had stopped Crosby's semi-breakaway, but the skate of the Penguins' star knocked the goaltender to the ice, leaving Guentzel an open net to shoot at with the rebound.\n\nAfter reviewing the goal, the referees ruled Devils forward Blake Coleman caused the problem by pushing Crosby in the back.\n\nZajac scored just 28 seconds into the game after DeSmith had trouble covering a Severson rebound.\n\nThe Penguins tied the score 1-all with Kessel's power-play goal at 13:19. Crosby held the puck in the right circle and fired a pass to Kessel stationed at the left edge of the net for a slam dunk.\n\nNew Jersey grabbed the lead again in the second period. After DeSmith stopped Hall in close, New Jersey kept the puck in the zone and Severson scored from between the circles after taking a pass from Hall.\n\nNew Jersey thought it had a 3-1 lead at 14:20 when Jesper Bratt scored on a breakaway, but the officials had blown the play dead because Kessel and Brett Seney were fighting in the Pittsburgh end.\n\nThe Penguins nearly tied it on the ensuing Devils power play, but Bryan Rust's short-handed shot was kept out by a combination of Kinkaid and the goalpost.\n\nNOTES: Goaltender Martin Brodeur, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame Monday, dropped a puck in a ceremonial opening faceoff before the game. ... Devils center Nico Hischier, the No. 1 pick overall in last year's draft, missed his first game with an upper-body injury. He is day to day.

The team sent a letter to the Korean Sport and Olympic Committee (KSOC) last week to outline their allegations.\n\nThe women, from a remote province famous for its garlic, captured hearts in a country that barely recognized curling before and became sought-after models for commercials.\n\nThe attention was so great during the games that their coach took away their cellphones to shield the curlers from any pressure. The Garlic Girls ultimately lost to Sweden in the gold medal match.\n\nIn the letter, Kim Eun-jung, Kim Seon-yeong and Kim Cho-hee as well as the sisters Kim Yeong-ae and Kim Yeong-mi accused former Korean Curling Federation (KCF) vice-president Kim Kyong-doo of verbal abuse and team coaches of giving unreasonable orders and subjecting their private lives to excessive control.\n\n\"The human rights of the athletes are being violated,\" the athletes, the first Asian team to win a curling silver, wrote. \"We've reached a point where it has become unbearable.\"\n\nThe curlers also accused coaches of holding back prize money and trying to sideline captain Kim Eun-jung after learning of her plans to start a family.\n\nThe coaches \"tried to rule Kim Eun-jung off the team after she got married in July,\" the letter said. \"They separated the skip and the team captain's role to minimize Kim Eun-jung's status on the team. They also tried not to include Kim Eun-jung in team training.\"\n\nThe players that they no longer wish to work with head coach Kim Min-jung, daughter of Kim Kyung-doo, and her husband, Jang Ban-seok, who is mixed doubles coach. The coaching staff deny the allegations.\n\n\"Kim Eun-jung had a plan to have a baby, and as a coach, in that case, we need to think about having a new skip,\" Jang said in a statement. \"We've never trained in a way that would lead to a curler being kicked off the team.\"\n\nJang also denied any funds had been withheld from the athletes, saying that the team had agreed that prize money would be spent on overseas training and competitions.\n\n\"We thought it was not right to distribute the prize money to each athlete for private use, because that money was earned as a national team supported by the KSOC and other sports organizations,\" he said. \"Besides that, money received from non-sports events was all paid to the curlers' private accounts.\"\n\nThe investigation will begin next week and will include officials from the sports ministry, the national Olympic committee and the team's home province of North Gyeongsang.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coming off three straight losses, the New York Islanders fell behind early. They took the lead with two quick goals and then pulled away in the third period for a confidence-building win.\n\nTom Kuhnhackl scored two unusual goals to lead the Islanders to a 5-2 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night.\n\n\"We definitely didn't have the start we wanted,\" Kuhnhackl said. \"After they scored that first goal we had a great response throughout that first period. We knew they were going to have a push in the second period. We just had to weather the storm.\"\n\nJordan Eberle had a goal and an assist, and Josh Bailey and Cal Clutterbuck also scored for the Islanders, who had won five straight before their losing streak. Mathew Barzal and Brock Nelson each had two assists and Thomas Greiss stopped 22 shots.\n\n\"Just because it's not April doesn't mean it's not a must-win,\" Clutterbuck said. \"You don't want to give a five-game winning streak back. We knew today we had to dig in and win it.\"\n\nNew York improved to 5-0-2 in the last seven meetings with Vancouver.\n\nBrendan Leipsic had a goal and an assist, and Jake Virtanen also scored for the Canucks, who have lost two straight after a 4-0-2 stretch. Jacob Markstrom, starting for the ninth consecutive game with Anders Nilsson injured, finished with 29 saves.\n\nVancouver, coming off a 2-1 loss across town against the Rangers on Monday night, fell to 1-2-2 on a six-game trip.\n\n\"This was deflating,\" Canucks coach Travis Green said. \"It was one of those nights. I like how we battled back. But down two on the road, you can be a little tired. It was a disappointing loss.\"\n\nKuhnhackl got his second of the game at 3:26 of the third period as Eberle's pass from the right corner deflected off Kuhnhackl's stick, a Vancouver defenseman's stick, and then Kuhnhackl's skate and in to push the Islanders' lead to 4-2. The goal stood after a video review, giving Kuhnhackl his first career multi-goal game.\n\nClutterbuck scored a power-play goal with 2:54 left, the Islanders' first in four games with the man-advantage. It was also Clutterbuck's first goal since Jan. 13 against the Rangers.\n\n\"It's been a while,\" he said. \"The worst thing is there's a lot of self-doubt that creeps in. Ten games, 15 games is one thing, but when it's that long you begin to doubt your own ability. ... It's a big relief.\"\n\nTrailing 3-1 after one period, the Canucks pulled within one on a power-play goal early in the second as Virtanen knocked in a rebound in front for his eighth of the season at 2:51.\n\nLeipsic got the Canucks on the scoreboard first, taking a pass from Michael Del Zotto at the bottom of the left circle and beating Greiss up high for his second of the season 2:48 into the game.\n\nThe Islanders went ahead with two goals 45 seconds apart. Kuhnhackl tied it on a delayed penalty on Vancouver as he swiped a backhander from his knees while falling down below the left circle, and the puck managed to sneak in between Markstrom's right pad and the post at 5:11.\n\n\"I tried to spin away from the defenseman, and I thought I got tripped and they got a penalty,\" Kuhnhackl said, \"so I just tried to throw it on net and I was fortunate enough the puck went in.\"\n\nNew York went ahead when Bailey tried to send a pass across to Anders Lee at the right side of the net, but the puck deflected off the skate of Vancouver defenseman Christopher Tanev and in at 5:56. Barzal's assist on the play gave him 100 points for his career.\n\nEberle pushed the Islanders' lead to 3-1 as he took a pass from Nelson from the left corner and poked it past Markstrom from the right side in front with 5:10 left in the opening period. Nelson got his 200th career point.\n\nNOTES: Loui Eriksson had an assist on Virtanen's goal, giving him nine assists and 16 points in 16 games against the Islanders. He also has four assists and eight points in his last six games. ... Vancouver dropped to 5-2-1 when scoring first. ... Islanders forward Andrew Ladd injured his right leg late in the second period and did not play in the third. ... Eberle has 19 goals and 10 assists in 38 career games against the Canucks. ...

This story contains details from \"This Is Us\" Season 3, Episode 7, \"Sometimes,\" which aired Nov. 13, 2018.\n\nWho knew Vietnam would be such a fruitful story source for \"This Is Us\"?\n\nThis week's episode of the NBC family drama focused on Kevin (Justin Hartley) and Zoe (Melanie Liburd) visiting Vietnam in the present, Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) road-tripping to Los Angeles in the past, and Jack's military service in the even further past. It was Jack's time in Vietnam that would greatly affect the other two timelines, from the way it made him withhold in his relationship with Rebecca, to the way Kevin and Zoe are building theirs.\n\nThe narrow focus of the episode was a smart choice on the writers' part, and helped give more weight to both Kevin's search for answers about Jack's service and the flashbacks to the service itself. It also was a showcase for Ventimiglia, a big presence here. \"Us\" fans need their Jack Pearson.\n\nThe episode began with a classic \"Us\" opening, which tracked how Jack's necklace came to be in the hands of the Vietnamese woman in the photograph, from its forging onward. It then returned to Jack and Nick's (Michael Angarano) brotherly reunion that ended the fourth episode.\n\nMichael Angarano as Nick Pearson on \"This Is Us.\" (Photo: Ron Batzdorff/NBC)\n\nAs you might have predicted, Nick was not happy to see his brother. He was angry and scared, upset that Jack risked his life by coming to Vietnam. Jack claimed he was going to fix Nick's problems by getting his brother assigned to his own unit, but when he took his case to Nick's commanding officer, not even classic Jack Pearson schmaltz could make it happen. Jack was forced to walk, alone, back to his unit.\n\nEventually he came upon a Vietnamese man with a motorbike and haggled a ride, only to discover that the man sometimes helped the Vietcong. Jack was reminded of the soldier in his unit who was killed.\n\nOnce he was back at his own camp, the two most important events from this timeline occurred: First, Jack saw the woman with the necklace, and shortly after, Nick's commander dropped him off with Jack. If Nick died while under Jack's command, it might explain Jack's reticence to talk about Vietnam.\n\nMore: 'This Is Us' recap: Baby steps toward personal growth for the Big Three\n\nJust a few years later, we saw Jack and Rebecca on their spontaneous road trip to Los Angeles, where Rebecca had a meeting with a record label, and Jack had mysterious people to see. Their road trip started off a little awkward, before the pair melted into the honeymoon phase of a new relationship. It was all driving, sex at motels and giggling over each other, until they reached sunny LA and reality came crashing down: Rebecca wasn't sure if she was going back to Pittsburgh.\n\nThe new couple wandered off to their respective appointments and uncertainty. Rebecca's meeting with the label exec, unsurprisingly, didn't go well. After listening to her demo he blew her off, saying she's \"Pittsburgh good.\" Jack, meanwhile, went to see the parents of the soldier he lost. He wanted to comfort them, but they ended up comforting him and offering him absolution, but it's clear that was not the only thing from Vietnam weighing on his heart.\n\nJack picked Rebecca up, and after she told him how poorly it went, he asked her to sing. And the man who claimed he never cried teared up in the car. Surprised but pleased, Rebecca said they should go home.\n\nIn the present, Kevin and Zoe arrived in Vietnam, and at first he discovered far more about his girlfriend than his father. Zoe asked him not to tag her on Instagram, lest her father know she's in Vietnam. Kevin was perturbed by her evasiveness, but she refused to talk about her life before she moved in with Beth's family.\n\nMelanie Liburd as Zoe and Justin Hartley as Kevin Pearson on \"This Is Us.\" (Photo: Ron Batzdorff/NBC)\n\nEventually, Kevin explained that he doesn't want a relationship built on secrets. His dad kept the first 28 years of his life secret from his mom, and he wants something more open. But, he also said he's falling in love with her.\n\nZoe decided to open up, explaining that her father sexually abused her, and he has tried repeatedly to get in touch with her to make amends. She casually dropped in that she's falling in love with Kevin, too.\n\nWhile they were out and about, Kevin found copies of his dad's necklace at a souvenir shop, and started to think it's not so special after all. But, if I know this show, it wouldn't give the necklace its own origin story unless it was more than just a tourist trinket.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/14/nbc-us-recap-season-3-episode-7-sometimes/1989752002/", "Brooklyn Nets young star Caris LeVert had the whole basketball world sending him positive thoughts Monday night after he suffered an injury that in a word was, gruesome.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to show it because you don\u2019t want to see it.\n\nBut less than 24 hours later he\u2019s been diagnosed with a dislocated right foot and there\u2019s talk of him returning to the court later this year.\n\nAmazing.\n\nHe thanked everyone who wished him well in this post on Tuesday:\n\nI just want to thank God above all things b/c despite how bad the injury looked, it could\u2019ve been a lot worse.

There are 12 players out of 72 in the field at Tiburon Golf Club this week with a chance to win the Globe, and five of those 12 are assured to hoist the trophy if they win Sunday.

It's a post that has been empty since former ambassador Joseph Westphal left in January 2017.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Abizaid would become ambassador as the Trump administration is weighing the U.S. response to the killing of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.\n\nTurkish officials claim Khashoggi was killed by a 15-member assassination squad sent from Riyadh on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has revoked the visas of the Saudis implicated in the killing.

(AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) \u2014 The second act of Louisville's Chris Mack era produced the same outcome as the first, but this time the Cardinals came away with a much better showing.\n\nJordan Nwora scored a career-high 20 points as the Cardinals (2-0) easily dominated Southern 104-54 Tuesday night. Malik Williams also posted a career high of 17 points in the rout.\n\nAfter Nicholls State stayed close with Louisville in last week's season opener, Mack used the practices to toughen up his players in preparation for a schedule that includes eight games against teams ranked in the AP's preseason top 10. Mack saw improvement on both sides of the court as the Cardinals shot 58.2 percent and forced 23 turnovers.\n\n\"The three practices that we had leading up to tonight really set the tone,\" he said. \"I really think you earn the right to win and you earn your victories in practice because that's who you become on game night.\"\n\nSouthern coach Sean Woods said he noticed a marked difference from the team he observed in game film.\n\n\"Handling pressure, making shots, executing high-low situations, so I tip my hat off to coach Mack because he's been working on getting his guys better,\" Woods said.\n\nOne of the players Mack wanted to see improve was Nwora. The sophomore forward came off the bench and scored 15 points in the first half. He provided an immediate spark, scoring a layup off a Jaguars turnover just two seconds after checking in. He later got frontcourt steals on consecutive possessions that he turned into back-to-back dunks, the latter of which made it 21-9 with 11:32 remaining.\n\nLouisville kept pulling away throughout the game, leading by as many as 53 points in the final minute. Mack used 13 players, with none playing more than 22 minutes. A dozen Cardinals ended up scoring.\n\n\"After the last game, I don't think a lot of people were happy with our performance, especially not the coaches,\" said Nwora, who made 7-of-11 shots. \"We just had to get better, and that's the way he woke us up. Just having some drills in practice that really brought out the toughness in some guys.\"\n\nAaron Ray led the Jaguars (0-3) with 14 points and eight rebounds.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSouthern: Facing its third major conference foe in a week, the Jaguars again struggled as they shot just 39.1 percent. They also had a hard time keeping up with bigger, more athletic Cardinals. By halftime, Southern committed 21 fouls, with two players picking up four each. The Jaguars finished getting whistled for 39 fouls. Three players fouled out, with four more drawing four each.\n\nLouisville: The Cardinals looked much more at ease Tuesday after struggling in their season opener. In addition to the practices, it may have been due to the size advantage Louisville enjoyed over the Jaguars, who did not start anyone taller than 6-foot-7. Louisville outrebounded Southern 37-22 and enjoyed a 38-20 scoring advantage in the paint.\n\nLOCKER ROOM CLOSED\n\nPrior to the game, Louisville announced its locker room would be closed for postgame interviews, per Mack's decision. The program had been one of the few to allow locker room access during the regular season. The NCAA maintains an open locker room policy during the March tournament.\n\nAGAU RETURNS\n\nTuesday marked the return of Akoy Agau to the Cardinals. The graduate transfer from Southern Methodist played 22 games for the Cardinals before leaving the program in late 2014 to play for Georgetown. The 6-foot-8 forward scored seven points and tied Nwora with a team-high seven rebounds against the Jaguars.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSouthern travels to Fairfax, Va., for a Saturday game at George Mason as part of the Emerald Coast Classic.\n\nLouisville concludes a three-game, season-opening homestand on Friday when it hosts Vermont.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

If the wind blows, though, it's going to be survival.\"\n\nMissing from the Open this year are two of Australia's top players, Jason Day, whose wife is expecting a baby, and Adam Scott. Jordan Spieth, a two-time champion, has also decided not to travel Down Under this year, and the field is one of the weakest for the tournament in years.\n\nGeoff Ogilvy, who won the Australian Open at The Lakes in 2010, was quoted as saying in Golf Australia magazine that he's disappointed the tournament, first played in 1904, isn't what it was back in the days when Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Arnold Palmer and Greg Norman were adding their names to the Stonehaven Cup.\n\nThe prize money of 1.25 million Australian dollars ($903,000) and A$225,000 ($163,000) to the winner this year can't compete with other tournaments around the world.\n\n\"We are now playing the Australian Open for less money than when I turned professional two decades ago,\" Ogilvy said. \"It was a big tournament back then. Played towards the end of the northern hemisphere summer it was surrounded by a few other big events. So players from elsewhere could bring their families and make the long trip worthwhile. It made sense.\"\n\nOgilvy said the increasing investment in rival tours means players and sponsor money is going elsewhere.\n\n\"The economic clout of the PGA Tour has done much to ruin so many events held outside the United States,\" Ogilvy said. \"Only those in the Middle East and maybe the HSBC event in China have been able to compete financially.\"\n\nKuchar on Wednesday said the Australian Open's history, and not the prize money, is a reason he's in Sydney.\n\n\"It adds to the allure of coming and playing and trying to put your name on that list of champions,\" Kuchar said. \"It is a national Open ... golf's such a big part of sport and people's lives in Australia.\"\n\nThe Australian Open field should improve next year when it is moved to the week before the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne. The 2019 Open is scheduled Dec. 5-8 at The Australian.\n\nTraditionally, many of the top U.S. and International players in the Presidents Cup come to Australia a week early to get over jet lag and acclimatize to the Australian conditions.\n\nThe Australian Open will be the first qualifying tournament for next year's British Open at Royal Portrush, with the top three players not already exempt earning spots.\n\n___\n\nMore AP golf: https://apnews.com/apf-Golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Something my father said a long time ago, don't give me flowers when I'm gone let me know what you feel now.\"\n\nStaley's Gamecocks play on Thursday against Clemson.

In fact, no one can specifically remember who her team beat to get that first victory. Stringer laughs about it now, saying that she had no idea she'd be still coaching nearly five decades later and win 1,000 games.\n\nWhile it took Stringer five tries to get win No. 900 in 2013, her team took care of reaching this milestone on its first try. The Scarlet Knights (3-0) scored 10 of the first 13 points and never looked back building a 37-17 halftime lead.\n\nStringer was concerned before the game that her team would be under a lot of pressure to win with so many people coming to celebrate the momentous victory.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan knew things wouldn't always go quite as smoothly for Nick Mullens as they did in his first start.\n\nSo when Mullens followed up his record-setting debut with a spottier performance that included two interceptions and a failed late drive, Shanahan wasn't overly concerned and remains committed to Mullens as the starter when the team returns from the bye next week.\n\n\"I think it's a positive experience,\" Shanahan said Tuesday. \"The guy's played one game in his career. I know statistically that was the best start in NFL history. I mean, I think Nick did some real good things yesterday, too. It was a little bit more of a challenge in some circumstances. ... What I liked about Nick is he never seemed rattled throughout the whole game, continued playing. He was great after the game. He was great watching film with him. I say it's a good experience or step forward because I think he'll get better from each experience he has.\"\n\nJust about everything went right for Mullens in his debut against the Oakland Raiders on Nov. 1, when he joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and Fran Tarkenton as the only players with at least 250 yards passing, three touchdown passes and no interceptions in the first career game. He also had the most efficient debut since the merger for a player with at least 20 attempts, posting a 151.9 rating in the 34-3 win.\n\nIt wasn't quite like that in a 27-23 loss to the New York Giants on Monday night. Mullens went 27 for 39 for 250 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nHe helped San Francisco (2-8) build a 10-point lead in the second half before the team blew it. Mullens then drove the Niners to the 21 in the closing minute before his last-ditch pass sailed out of the back of the end zone to send San Francisco to another loss.\n\nMullens' best play came in the third quarter when he went through several reads before finding running back Matt Breida for an 11-yard touchdown pass that made it 20-10.\n\nBut there were also some mistakes, like a slightly off-target pass to Marquise Goodwin that led to an interception in the second half and a late throw to Kendrick Bourne that led to an earlier pick in the first half that set up a New York touchdown.\n\n\"I thought he did some decent things last night,\" Shanahan said. \"He's a good pocket passer, so I want him to be perfect at it. He was pretty good on a number of his reads. He had a touchdown get into the last guy in his progression. Had a couple big plays, getting into number two and three. But, I want him to be automatic. I know that's what he wants to do, too. And we'll keep working at it until he is.\"\n\nThe 49ers should be healthy when they return from the bye with Shanahan predicting that everyone on the roster should be available to practice next week. That includes linebacker Reuben Foster, who missed the past two games with a hamstring injury, as well as receiver Pierre Garcon (knee) and safety Jaquiski Tartt (shoulder), who sat out Monday with injuries.\n\nDefensive backs K'Waun Williams (stinger) and receiver Goodwin were banged up in the game against the Giants but aren't expected to miss any time.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Matt Ludtke) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Running back Aaron Jones' breakout game led to a breakthrough performance in the red zone for the Green Bay Packers.\n\nIn Sunday's 31-12 victory over the Miami Dolphins, Jones rushed for a career-high 145 yards and two touchdowns. With Jones taking some of the pressure off quarterback Aaron Rodgers, the Packers scored four touchdowns in four possessions inside the Dolphins 20-yard line.\n\nIt was Green Bay's first perfect day with more than one red-zone possession since Week 4 of the 2017 season.\n\n\"You saw it the other night,\" Rodgers said on Tuesday. \"Running the football in the red zone has not been a high priority for us, but the abilities that he brings slashing inside can give us some opportunities to run some more of those plays in the red zone.\"\n\nTheir next test comes on Thursday night on the road against the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nSituational football \u2014 red zone and third down \u2014 has been troublesome for Green Bay's offense all season. Before the Miami game, the Packers ranked sixth in total offense (406.6 yards per game), but were only 14th in scoring (24.0 points per game) because of inconsistencies on third down (17th, 39.4 percent conversion rate) and the red zone (19th, 53.9 percent touchdowns).\n\nAgainst the Dolphins, they gained 377 yards but scored 31 points, thanks in large part to their success in the red zone.\n\nThe threat of the running game gives the Packers (4-4-1) another option as they advance toward the goal line.\n\nWhile Jones scored on runs of 2 and 10 yards, Rodgers threw touchdown passes of 7 and 25 yards to receiver Davante Adams to punctuate the other two red zone possessions. Adams is tied for second in the NFL with nine touchdown receptions. Of those, a league-high eight have come in the red zone. Since the start of the 2016 season, Adams has a league-high 22 red zone touchdown receptions.\n\nThe closer to the goal line, the less space there is to operate and the more difficult it becomes to throw. Adams' edge comes from being one of the NFL's premier route runners.\n\n\"Because the window is so tight, and he can create enough separation to where he makes that window bigger,\" Rodgers said.\n\nWith the emergence of Jones, the Packers have another weapon to use in their push for a playoff spot in the crowded NFC. Jones missed the first two games of the season with a suspension, then was part of a three-man committee in the backfield before taking over as the starter.\n\nIn the three weeks since the bye, Jones has carried 41 times, Jamaal Williams has carried 14 times and Ty Montgomery was traded to the Ravens.\n\n\"The more carries you get, I feel like the better you're going to get and the more of a game flow you get in,\" Jones said.\n\nEntering Thursday, Jones and Williams both have 73 carries. Jones, however, has rushed for 494 yards (compared to 270 for Williams) on a league-best 6.8-yard average. Jones had a 67-yard run in the first quarter against Miami, the team's longest since receiver Randall Cobb had a 67-yard run in 2013.\n\nWith Jones' emergence to join Rodgers and Adams, the Packers hope they have the firepower for back-to-back road tests against Seattle and Minnesota.\n\n\"It puts the defense in a bind,\" Adams said. \"It puts them to where they've got to load up that box and it allows us to have more opportunities outside. If they keep moving the ball like that and slashing and making big plays, it's pretty tough to figure out what to defend.\"\n\nNOTES: The Packers held what coach Mike McCarthy described as a \"very limited\" practice on Tuesday before departing for Seattle in the evening. WR Randall Cobb (hamstring), CB Kevin King (hamstring), S Kentrell Brice (ankle), OLB Nick Perry (knee) were not traveling with the team, though the Packers said their game status would be updated on the final injury report on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Mark Dantonio often shies away from talking about injuries. This year, the topic is unavoidable.\n\nThe question is whether Michigan State's offensive woes can be blamed mostly on poor health \u2014 or if there are deeper problems the Spartans need to resolve.\n\n\"Obviously we're playing very well on the defensive side of the ball,\" Dantonio said Tuesday. \"We've got to get better on the offensive side of the ball, but that's where really all of our injuries have occurred.\"\n\nAfter a 26-6 loss to Ohio State last weekend, Michigan State is 13th in the Big Ten in total offense. It's been a disappointing showing for a unit that returned almost every starter from a year ago, and as the Spartans wrap up a fairly pedestrian season, Dantonio faces the tricky task of evaluating an offense that has been a weak link but is nowhere near full strength.\n\n\"This year I would say it's the injuries. It's always something; every year you're going to deal with something,\" Dantonio said. \"A lot of things are predicated in how your quarterback plays. That's college football. That's pro football. That's high school football. If your quarterback is playing well, you're going to be successful, usually.\"\n\nMichigan State (6-4) expected a lot from quarterback Brian Lewerke this year, but he has dealt with a shoulder injury and has been splitting time lately with backup Rocky Lombardi. Running back LJ Scott hurt an ankle and is now redshirting .\n\nFelton Davis was lost for the year with an Achilles tendon injury, and fellow receivers Cody White, Darrell Stewart and Jalen Nailor have missed time, too. The offensive line has also been weakened by injuries.\n\nThe problem for Michigan State \u2014 looking ahead to next year \u2014 is that it's hard to tell how much the injuries are holding the Spartans back. There's some evidence that the offense has been in decline for a while. Michigan State averaged 43 points a game and finished second in the Big Ten in total offense in 2014, but the Spartans haven't been close to that level since.\n\nIn the three seasons following that 2014 campaign, Michigan State was sixth, sixth and eighth in the league in total offense. The Spartans have dropped even further this year.\n\nMichigan State has been particularly bad on third down this season. The Spartans have converted just 30 percent of the time, one of the worst marks in the FBS.\n\n\"We just haven't been able to get the completions we needed, and we've been in some tough situations, especially some tough field position,\" tight end Matt Sokol said. \"Just comes down to execution, and all of us just coming together.\"\n\nMichigan State takes a good deal of pride in the continuity of its staff. Defensive coordinator Mike Tressel and co-offensive coordinator Dave Warner have been with the Spartans for Dantonio's whole 12-season tenure as coach.\n\nBut as the offense sputters, Warner in particular is under scrutiny. Right now, the Spartans are still hoping to win their last two regular-season games and go to the best bowl they can, but the offseason isn't far off. That's when Dantonio will show \u2014 through his words and actions \u2014 how much of Michigan State's struggles he felt could have been avoided.\n\n\"We've lost four football games. I feel like we've had a chance to win every one of those. So it's more than just about injuries that we didn't win those games,\" Dantonio said. \"It's coaching decisions, it's head coaching decisions, it's players that are playing, you know, breakdowns or the ability to execute. It's the execution of the people we're playing against, that they do a good job. So, so many things you look at there. We're going to keep getting better and keep pushing.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nIncreased Woolsey Fire activity was seen Tuesday near Lake Sherwood. (Photo courtesy of California Highway Patrol via the Ventura County Star)\n\nPARADISE, Calif. \u2013 Ernest Foss was a musician who gave lessons out of his home when he lived in San Francisco, where an amplifier that ran the length of a wall served as the family\u2019s living room couch. Carl Wiley refurbished tires for Michelin. Jesus Fernandez, known as \u201cZeus,\u201d was described as a loving father and loyal friend.\n\nThey were among the first victims identified in the aftermath of the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, an inferno blamed for at least 42 deaths, with authorities ramping up the search Tuesday for still more souls.\n\nThe flames all but obliterated the Northern California town of Paradise, population 27,000, and ravaged surrounding areas last Thursday. The exact number of missing was unclear, but many friends and relatives of those living in the fire zone said they hadn\u2019t heard from loved ones. Some went to shelters looking for the missing.\n\nEfforts were underway to bring in mobile morgues, cadaver dogs, a rapid DNA analysis system for identifying victims, and an additional 150 search-and-rescue personnel on top of 13 teams already looking for remains \u2013 a grim indication that the death toll would almost surely rise.\n\nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea\u2019s office has identified four of the victims, publicly naming three.\n\nJames Wiley said sheriff\u2019s deputies informed him that his father, Carl, was among the dead, but the younger Wiley hadn\u2019t been able to leave his property in the fire area to see for himself. The elder Wiley, 77, was a tire-recapper, and the family lived in Alaska for many years before moving to Butte County decades ago.\n\nJames Wiley said his father was a stoic veteran, and the two had not spoken in six years. \u201cHey, I lost him a long time ago,\u201d the younger man said.\n\nFoss, 63, moved to Paradise eight years ago because the high cost of living pushed him out of the San Francisco Bay Area, according to his daughter, Angela Loo. He had swollen limbs and couldn\u2019t walk. He had also been on oxygen.\n\nLoo told KTVU-TV in Oakland that her father taught music out of their home in San Francisco and turned the living room into a studio.\n\n\u201cI love that he shared his gift of music with me and so many others during his lifetime,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would want to be remembered for being a San Franciscan through and through.\u201d\n\nFernandez, a 48-year-old Concow resident, also died.\n\nMyrna Pascua, whose husband was best friends with the man known as \u201cZeus,\u201d called him a \u201ctireless provider, a dependable and loyal friend, a considerate neighbor, and loving father. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.\u201d\n\nFive days after the blaze, over 1,000 people were at more than a half-dozen shelters set up for evacuees. At the Neighborhood Church in Chico, counselors, chaplains and nursing students from California State University, Chico, were available to help.\n\nVolunteers cooked meals, and there was a large bulletin board with information about missing people.\n\nEddie Lazarom, who fled Paradise on foot before getting a lift from a UPS truck, was among those staying at the church. He said he had yet to hear from his three grandchildren, ages 22, 24 and 28.\n\n\u201cI am really worried about them. They have common sense, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019d hate to find out later that they burned up,\u201d he said.\n\nGreg Gibson came to the shelter for information about his neighbors. He doesn\u2019t know if they tried to leave or not but says the fire exploded so quickly that if they hesitated, they would have had trouble.\n\n\u201cIt happened so fast. I would have been such an easy decision to stay, but it was the wrong choice,\u201d Gibson said.\n\nThe search for the dead was drawing on portable devices that can identify someone\u2019s genetic material in a couple of hours, rather than days or weeks.\n\n\u201cIn many circumstances, without rapid DNA technology, it\u2019s just such a lengthy process,\u201d says Frank DePaolo, a deputy commissioner of the New York City medical examiners\u2019 office, which has been at the forefront of the science of identifying human remains since 9/11 and is exploring how it might use a rapid DNA device.\n\nStill, experts said Tuesday that authorities may first try more traditional methods of identification such as examining dental records. That\u2019s in part because victims might have undergone dental X-rays but not personal DNA profiles. Medical records of bone fractures, prosthetics or implants can also be helpful.\n\nBefore the Paradise tragedy, the deadliest single fire on record in California was a 1933 blaze in Griffith Park in Los Angeles that killed 29.\n\nAt the other end of the state, firefighters made progress against a massive blaze that has killed two people in star-studded Malibu and destroyed well over 400 structures in Southern California .\n\nThe flames roared to life again in a mountainous wilderness area Tuesday, sending up a huge plume of smoke near the community of Lake Sherwood. Still, firefighters made gains. The number of people evacuated was down by about half from the day before, to around 100,000, authorities said, and the fire was partially contained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting the upper hand here. We\u2019re feeling better,\u201d Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown said California is \u201cpretty well maxed out\u201d from fighting several deadly wildfires, and he expressed gratitude for help from surrounding states and the federal government. He said the state is doing everything possible to prevent fires, but \u201csome things only God can do.\u201d\n\nInterior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he canceled a trip to Asia and will visit the fire zones Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThe fire in Northern California charred at least 195 square miles (505 square kilometers), but officials said crews were able to keep it from advancing toward Oroville, a town of about 19,000 people.\n\nThe state recently completed a $1.1 billion reconstruction project at the Oroville Dam \u2013 the nation\u2019s tallest at 770 feet (235 meters) \u2013 and officials worried about damage if flames came through. Spillways at the dam crumbled during heavy rains in 2017, prompting thousands to flee for fear of a catastrophic release of water.\n\nThe cause of the fires remained under investigation, but they broke out around the time and place two utilities reported equipment trouble. Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, who takes office in January, sidestepped questions about what action should be taken against utilities if their power lines are found to be responsible.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/13/search-victims-and-missing-california-wildfire-continues/1995025002/", "None\n\nThe cast of \"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" gather at Britain's Cineworld Leicester Square to celebrate the upcoming release of the latest film in the \"Harry Potter\" franchise.

USA TODAY\n\nWest Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen looks at the scoreboard during the third quarter against Texas. (Photo: Bethany Hocker, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWest Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen doesn\u2019t watch the \u201creality TV,\u201d as he puts it, that is the weekly College Football Playoff rankings: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do me any good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do our players any good.\"\n\n\u201cIt does coaches no good to think about it and talk about it,\u201d Holgorsen told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cI really, honestly don\u2019t (watch). I get why that show is, it\u2019s all advertising and all that stuff. Fans want to watch it and it\u2019s been great for college football. You guys want to follow it and write about it and read about it and talk scenarios and all that good stuff. It\u2019s the most popular thing going.\"\n\nNot to say that Holgorsen is unaware of the Mountaineers\u2019 climb up the rankings. Ranked No. 13 in the first release of the 2018 season, West Virginia moved to No. 9 last week \u2014 climbing on the back of a 42-41 win at No. 15 Texas. The Mountaineers held that spot Tuesday after Saturday's 47-10 win against TCU.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress,\u201d he said.\n\nNow 8-1 overall, with that one loss coming at No. 16 Iowa State, this year\u2019s surge has the Mountaineers alongside Big 12 rival Oklahoma and a handful of fellow contenders from the Power Five leagues as the teams ready to pounce if given a window to slip into the top four.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time West Virginia has played a national role under Holgorsen, the Mountaineers\u2019 head coach since 2011, but this season marks something new: WVU entering the heart of November as a realistic challenger for a national semifinal, not as a team on the outskirts of a New Year\u2019s Six bowl and playing the role of spoiler for opponents ranked higher by the selection committee.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been knocking on the door a little bit, as we are this year, which is all we\u2019re at right now \u2014 we\u2019re just in the conversation,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the conversation a couple other years and couldn\u2019t get it done, you know. \u201c\n\nThis year\u2019s team is the culmination of a shift in style and approach, changes the Mountaineers embraced amid a run of middling success from 2014-16 that have come to define the program in Holgorsen\u2019s eighth season. While still rooted in Air Raid principles, the offense has forged a commitment to the running game even as senior quarterback Will Grier puts together a season worthy of Heisman Trophy consideration. WVU enters Saturday\u2019s matchup with Oklahoma State ranked third in the Big 12 in yards per carry and sixth nationally in yards per play.\n\nHolgorsen has also changed the Mountaineers\u2019 practice habits and routine; drills now mirror how teams operate in the NFL, he said. Both changes, in how the team attacks on offense and in its practice habits, have been \u201ca big help for our defense,\u201d said Holgorsen. WVU ranks 43rd nationally in yards allowed per play, nearly a full yard better than a unit that ranked 98th in the same category a season ago.\n\nIn recruiting, the Mountaineers have gone from emphasizing Texas to sticking closer to home, in West Virginia and the nearby corners of Ohio and Pennsylvania. To this mix Holgorsen has added a heavy dose of transfers \u2014 players from junior colleges, graduate transfers and additions from fellow programs on the Football Bowl Subdivision level, such as Grier from Florida. The success rate with these transfers is around 50 percent, Holgorsen estimated.\n\n\u201cWe weathered the storm and made some adjustments in terms of how we were recruiting and how we were playing football, how we were practicing,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew we had a lot of work to do because we weren\u2019t where we needed to be in order to compete. There\u2019s a lot of things that needed to change. It\u2019s been fun to watch it change, and it\u2019s change the way it needs to.\u201d\n\nWith at least two and as many three games left in its regular season, new-look West Virginia\u2019s path to the playoff now goes through Oklahoma \u2014 first in the season finale, a home game on Nov. 23, and perhaps again a week later, should the two meet again to decide the Big 12 championship. WVU has yet to defeat the Sooners in six tries since joining the conference, with just one meeting decided by a single possession.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mountaineers will be keeping tabs on the scoreboard. Notre Dame losing to either Syracuse or Southern California would open up a spot in the top four. Another scenario deals with the Big Ten, and finds the winner of the Michigan and Ohio State matchup losing once more before the postseason, potentially to Northwestern in the conference title game.\n\nIn the playoff era, at least, this is uncharted territory: WVU might need help to crack the top four, but the Mountaineers have played themselves into position to become just the second Big 12 team to reach a semifinal, joining the Sooners. Not that they\u2019re paying attention to the standings.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point now where we have a chance.,\u201d Holgorsen said. \u201cWe just gotta keep blocking things out and keep the same approach that we\u2019ve had.\u201d", "Alabama running back Josh Jacobs (8) carries the ball during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Mississippi State, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Tuscaloosa, Ala.

A 12-1 SEC champion Alabama is not getting left out of the playoff, nor should it under any available circumstances this season.\n\nBut 12-1 without an SEC championship? The committee has already twice sent teams that did not reach their conference title games to the playoff.

Last year, Alabama seemed like a default pick at 11-1 over Ohio State and USC. Both were 11-2 with conference titles, but ugly losses on their ledgers.\n\nCould the committee squeeze in the Tide after a loss to Georgia, which would obviously get in, if Clemson, Notre Dame and Michigan (and maybe even Oklahoma) all won out? It's not as if Alabama would have a loaded resume, with victories against LSU, Mississippi State and Auburn at the top. But there is also little doubt Alabama would be favored on a neutral field against any team in the country.\n\nThe committee has to be rooting for the Tide to keep it out of this mess.\n\n2. Ohio State beats Michigan and wins the Big Ten.\n\nBig 12 fans will disagree, but Michigan at 12-1 looks like a good bet to sail into the playoff \u2014 especially if Notre Dame finishes unbeaten, therefore making the Wolverines' only loss a one-score game in the opener at South Bend. The Buckeyes have nice road victories against Penn State and Michigan State. Add Michigan and Northwestern in the Big Ten championship game to that resume, and suddenly a season of struggles in Columbus, Ohio, won't look so bad at all. The stain of that blowout loss at Purdue won't come off easy, though, and choosing between Ohio State at 12-1 and Oklahoma at 12-1 or West Virginia at 11-1 or Washington State at 12-1 won't be such an easy chore for the committee.\n\n3. Notre Dame loses, especially to Southern California.\n\nAny loss for the Irish looks problematic if the rest of the contenders win out. Michigan could help Notre Dame by finishing 12-1. The Irish could make the case the committee can't put the Wolverines in and leave out the one team that beat them. Don't let anyone tell you the Irish are out with one loss. That's shortsighted and doesn't take into account that Big 12 contenders Oklahoma and West Virginia and Washington State could easily pick up a second loss before they even reach their conference title games.\n\nStill, the Irish at 11-1 pits them against any other once-beaten conference champion, while also possibly forcing the committee to justify putting Michigan in and leaving the Irish out.

Anderson (20) runs as Baltimore Ravens' Patrick Ricard (42) defends in the second half of an NFL football game in Charlotte, N.C. The Carolina Panthers waived running back C.J. Anderson, who was a 1,000-yard rusher in 2017 for the Denver Broncos. (AP Photo/Nell Redmond, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Panthers coach Ron Rivera said C.J. Anderson's frustration with his smaller-than-expected role on offense contributed to the team's decision to release the former 1,000-yard rusher midway through the season.\n\nRivera said he spoke recently to Anderson and could sense the veteran running back's frustration over not being more involved in Carolina's offense.\n\nChristian McCaffrey is the team's starter and rarely leaves the field, playing in 96 percent of his team's offensive snaps \u2014 by far the most of any running back in the league.\n\nMost of Anderson's reps have come in a shared backfield set with McCaffrey the Panthers called \"Pony 21.\" Anderson has carried the ball just 24 times and caught one pass this season. The limited role came just one season after Anderson ran for 1,007 yards for the Broncos.\n\n\"He's a veteran guy who has had a lot of success in this league and was just looking for more opportunities,\" Rivera said Tuesday, one day after the Panthers released Anderson. \"You could feel\" the frustration.\n\nRivera reiterated what general manager Marty Hurney said Monday \u2014 that Anderson did not ask to be released from the Panthers (6-3), who visit the Lions on Sunday after a 52-21 shellacking at the hands of the Steelers last week.\n\nAnderson tweeted Monday: \"No love lost. Thank you Carolina. Grind time.\"\n\nRivera said Cameron Artis-Payne will take over Anderson's role as the No. 2 back in Carolina.\n\nArtis-Payne was a fifth-round pick in 2015, but has played in just 25 games and carried the ball only 99 times during his career for 422 yards with four touchdowns.\n\nRivera believes Artis-Payne, who has only been active for two games this season, has a similar skillset to Anderson and can also come in and spell McCaffrey during games. Carolina also signed veteran running back Travaris Cadet, a player Rivera views as similar in style to McCaffrey as a backup plan.\n\nRivera called Artis-Payne \"a tough, hard-nosed young man\" who has gone about his role the right way in practice despite not seeing much playing time.\n\n\"He's waited for his opportunity and earned this opportunity, and hopefully when he gets his chance on the football field he will take advantage of it,\" Rivera said.\n\nRivera said the Panthers offense evolved this year under first-year offensive coordinator Norv Turner, and that things began to focus around McCaffrey as the primary, if not exclusive, back on offense \u2014 similar to how Turner extensively used LaDainian Tomlinson when he coached the San Diego Chargers.\n\nMcCaffrey's expanded role isn't a huge surprise.\n\nRivera said before the season that getting the second-year back 25 to 30 touches per game would be \"ideal,\" although few could have imagined that he'd leave the field as infrequently as he has this season.\n\n\"The more Norv got to know who Christian is, the more we saw we could keep him on the field,\" Rivera said. \"A lot of things that we can do are structured around his skillset.\"\n\nMcCaffrey leads the Panthers with 579 yards rushing, followed by Cam Newton with 352 yards and wide receiver D.J. Moore with 122.\n\nAnderson, who had been expected to be used as a short-yardage back, had 104 yards rushing and no touchdowns on the ground in nine games. His lone reception went for a 24-yard touchdown.\n\nMcCaffrey said Anderson's release was a reminder the game is a business.\n\n\"Our coaches have a lot of confidence in the guys that are here right now and they had to make a decision they felt was best for the team,\" McCaffrey said. \"As far as we are concerned we have to focus on the guys here and wish him the very best. Our guys right now are just locked into us.\"\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Sooners got a scare from Oklahoma State, but did not fall from No. 6.\n\nLSU, Washington State, West Virginia and Ohio State came next, meaning the top 10 spots all remained unchanged for the first time since the committee started unveiling its rankings in the 2014 season.\n\nCentral Florida, the other unbeaten in the Bowl Classification, moved up one spot to No. 11. The Knights have a 22-game winning streak, but appear unlikely to be given serious consideration.\n\nHeading down the homestretch, there field seems to be coming into focus as long as there are no major surprises.\n\nThe three remaining major unbeatens - Alabama, Clemson and Notre Dame - are certain to get in without a loss. There are a couple potential hiccups to that scenario. The Crimson Tide have one ranked opponent left, Georgia in the SEC title game. Notre Dame faces No. 12 Syracuse on Saturday at Yankee Stadium. Clemson does not have a ranked team left on its schedule, but rival South Carolina and the ACC championship game still loom.\n\nMichigan remains best positioned to win out and make secure the fourth spot. The Wolverines will host Indiana and then travel to Ohio State. Two wins would set up a meeting in the Big Ten title game with Northwestern.\n\nGeorgia would likely be in if the Bulldogs can beat Alabama on Dec. 1. That would create some debate between potential one-loss champions from the Big Ten or Big 12 and the Crimson Tide.\n\nThe top four teams in final rankings on Dec. 2 will play in the semifinals. Those two games will be at in the Orange Bowl and Cotton Bowl on Dec. 29. The championship game will be played on Jan. 7 in Santa Clara, California, at Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nCollege Football Playoff committee top 25\n\n1. Alabama (10-0)\n\n2. Clemson (10-0)\n\n3.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) \u2014 After five straight weeks of preparing and coming up empty, the New York Giants have something to smile about starting off a week.\n\nIt's amazing what a win can do for a team.\n\n\"Anytime you win, it kind of verifies that what you're doing is right,\" coach Pat Shurmur said Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the Giants (2-7) rallied late to snap a five-game losing streak with a 27-23 win over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\"The reason we all started playing and coaching football is because we love the competition, we love the physical nature of the game, and we love the process of getting ready to play the next opponent,\" Shurmur added.\n\n\"Then on game day, you put all your energy into winning, all your energy into putting a winning performance on the field, and so I sensed real joy in the locker room yesterday \u2014 a bunch of guys that put a lot into it, and we were able to overcome some adversity and win a football game.\"\n\nThe goal now for the Giants is to try to put a couple of wins together. They haven't done that since December 2016. They have a 5-20 record in their past 25 games.\n\nThe difference Monday night against the 49ers was the Giants made plays. Eli Manning threw three touchdowns and engineered a late drive capped by a short touchdown pass to Sterling Shepard.\n\nThe offensive line, aided by the addition of newcomer Jamon Brown at right guard, allowed only one sack and the defense got two interceptions from linebacker B.J. Goodson.\n\nSpecial teams also contributed as Aldrick Rosas kicked two field goals and Corey Coleman had three kickoff returns for 92 yards.\n\nThe performance by Manning was excellent. There have been many calling for the 37-year-old to be benched with the team losing again. The two-time Super Bowl MVP answered the critics.\n\n\"Any time a player puts a winning performance on the field, he should feel good about it at least for a day or so,\" Shurmur said. \"The challenge is to then prepare to do it again in a week, so I don't know. That's a question for him, but he had a winning performance, he helped us win a game, and he should feel good about that. Now we just have to build on that going into Tampa.\"\n\nThe Giants will play host to the Buccaneers in their bid for their first win of the season at home (0-4).\n\nWhile the Giants' chances of making the playoffs remain dim, Shurmur likes the team that has been assembled in his first season.\n\n\"This is a really good locker room \u2014 we're young, we're new, but these guys believe in each other and try to play the game for each other,\" he said. \"I don't know if they were loose, I don't know if that's the right term, but I thought they were just out there playing hard and having fun playing football.\"\n\nNOTES: Shurmur said the Giants had the usual wear and tear in the game, but he expects no one to miss Sunday. ... Brown played very well considering he had been with the team only a week. ... Shurmur also said rookie linebacker Lorenzo Carter had his best game in both the pass rush and coverage. ... Saquon Barkley had 20 carries for 67 yards and caught four passes for 33 yards. It was the eighth time in nine games Barkley had at least 100 scrimmage yards. \"If we're just going to talk about Saquon and his involvement in the game, whether we hand it to him or throw it to him, it really doesn't matter. You'd like to see your back touch the ball or run the ball close to 20 times,\" Shurmur said\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Rodrigo Abd, AP)\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 The first waves of the migrant caravan arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border near Tijuana on Tuesday, but the vast majority of the Central Americans remained more than 1,000 miles away, trying to pick up their pace in their quest to seek asylum.\n\nThe roughly 350 migrants who reached the border were part of smaller splinter groups who grew impatient with the caravan's progress, preferring to forego the security of traveling in numbers to more quickly file their asylum claims in the United States, according to local authorities and migrant advocates.\n\nBut an estimated 5,000 migrants spent Monday night in the central Mexican city of Guadalajara, before enduring another round of frustration during their attempts to move farther north on Tuesday. More than 2,000 more have received temporary visas to stay in the country.\n\nMore: The migrant caravan has arrived. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe state government of Jalisco organized buses to take the migrants to the next state to the north, Nayarit, where they expected to have other buses waiting for them to continue the trek north, according to a statement from Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a migrant advocacy group traveling with the caravan. But the buses dropped off the migrants 55 miles away from Nayarit, leaving the migrants stranded.\n\n\"This is a clear decision by the Jalisco state government to get us out of Guadalajara,\" Pueblo Sin Fronteras said in a statement. \"It puts at risk the physical integrity, security and health of thousands of families with children, who are being left in the darkness of the early morning.\"\n\nCLOSE Migrant caravans winding their way toward the U.S. are reigniting rhetoric and arguments about immigration and border security. And it's not the first time. USA TODAY\n\nMigrants halfway to border\n\nDespite the new round of difficulties, Guadalajara marked the halfway milestone for the caravan, which set out Oct. 12 from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and has traveled roughly 1,400 miles. The caravan inched through Central America and southern Mexico, enduring brutal heat, torrential downpours and logistical complications.\n\nThe pace has accelerated as the group enters northern Mexico, sometimes traveling more than 100 miles a day, where temperatures are chillier than the subtropical south of the country. The capital city of Mexico City hosted the caravan for almost a week in a sports stadium at a cost of nearly $600,000, according to interim mayor Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Avieva.\n\nBut some impatient with the slow, steady pace started splintering off.\n\nThe first couple of waves arrived in Tijuana on Tuesday. Another small group is risking the cartel-controlled territory of eastern Mexico to reach Texas, according to officials at a migrant shelter in Saltillo, about 190 miles south of Laredo, Texas.\n\n\"People need to see that they keep on moving or walking,\" said Rodrigo Abeja, project coordinator with Pueblo Sin Fronteras. \"They get desperate when staying put.\"\n\nThe groups going it alone appear to be receiving support from Mexican officials. They are sleeping in shelters prepared by state and local governments, and being monitored, but not stopped, by immigration agents and police officers. In some cases, local governments are even providing bus rides, which happened Monday in the coastal state of Sinaloa, where some 400 migrants were given rides up the coast, according to local media.\n\nMexico issues 2,700 temporary visa\n\nOthers have been able to beg for funds or receive money from relatives for bus rides to the border, Abeja said. He added that federal officers were slowing traffic, which allowed caravan participants to hitch rides aboard everything from tractor trailers to agricultural vehicles.\n\nThe Mexican government has also offered refuge, asylum or work visas to caravan participants. The government said Monday that 2,697 temporary visas had been issued to individuals and families to cover them during the 45-day application process for more permanent status. Another 533 migrants have requested a voluntary return to their countries, the government reported.\n\nPolls show Mexicans offering tepid support for the caravan. But other issues, led by the pending presidential transition on Dec. 1, have made more headlines.\n\nA Consulta Mitofsky survey found 51.4 percent of respondents said Mexico should \u201chelp and protect\u201d the caravan, while 33.8 percent said the government should \u201cnot help and pressure to return them to their countries.\u201d Rural residents were more inclined to support the caravan crossing Mexico than urban dwellers, according to the survey.\n\nLess than one percent of Mexico\u2019s population is foreign-born, said Javier Urbano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University, who studies immigration. But with many Central Americans staying rather than transiting the country, the immigration debate \"is just beginning.\"\n\nCLOSE Drone footage shows from above some of the several thousand Central Americans, mostly Hondurans, that have been trekking in a caravan through southern Mexico with hopes of reaching the United States.

Few expressed haste to hit the road, having traveled the same grueling path as the original caravan.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s been slow, but that\u2019s because there are so many women and children,\" said Omar Cruz, 27, a painter from Honduras, who was fleeing gang violence at home and in no rush to reach the border. \"The border's not going anywhere.\"\n\n\n\nLike so many other caravan members walking ahead and behind him, Cruz wasn't dissuaded by the stories of the U.S. government attempting to impede asylum applications.\n\n\n\n\"The law lets a person apply for asylum,\" Cruz said. \"If you're patient and have faith in God, you can make it happen.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/13/migrant-caravan-some-border-most-mexico-far-us/1992059002/", "Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr speaks at a news conference before an NBA basketball game between the Warriors and the Atlanta Hawks in Oakland, Calif., Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Golden State Warriors don't expect Draymond Green's latest dustup with Kevin Durant to become a long-term issue for the two-time defending NBA champions.\n\nNor do they expect the emotional Green to change after his one-game suspension by the team Tuesday.\n\nDurant said he expects to work things out with Green, saying, \"I'm sure it will, we've got a long season ahead.\"\n\n\"His presence has been a part of this team for a while, even before I got here he'd been a huge staple in this organization,\" Durant said. \"Obviously it's definitely weird not having him around and everything that went down. But that's what happens, (stuff) happens in the NBA.\"\n\nGreen was suspended one game without pay for conduct detrimental to the team following an altercation a night earlier with Durant, though general manager Bob Myers declined to offer specifics on the All-Star forward's behavior that was considered going too far. Myers and Steve Kerr collaborated on the decision.\n\n\"We just felt like this rose to the level of acting the way we did,\" Myers said, noting of Green: \"He was professional. He loves to play basketball, which is all you can ask of him.\"\n\nThe Warriors made the announcement about four hours before they were set to host Atlanta, and the 28-year-old Green was serving the suspension as his teammates beat the Hawks 110-103. He wasn't at Oracle Arena and didn't immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.\n\n\"I think we'll be fine,\" Kerr said. \"We're a team that goes through stuff, just like everybody else. And things happen, bumps in the road. You've got to move forward. It's all part of coaching a team, it's all part of being on a team. You have to get through the adversity and there are some difficult times and you just get through them.\"\n\nIn the closing seconds of regulation during Monday's 121-116 overtime loss on the road to the Clippers, Green secured a rebound and, with Durant calling for the ball, instead dribbled the length of the court into traffic and lost control as the Warriors failed to get a shot off. Durant was shown on camera visibly upset immediately afterward.\n\nThen, back on the bench waiting for the extra period to begin, the two traded words and gestured with Klay Thompson seated between them and Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins and others trying to calm the situation.\n\nDurant wouldn't get into the specifics of what was said.\n\n\"I'm going to keep that in house, that's what we do here. I'm not trying to give nobody no headlines,\" Durant said. \"What happened, happened. We're trying to move on, we're just trying to play basketball.\"\n\nFor everyone who figures this franchise is perfect, Myers quickly cleared up that notion.\n\n\"It's hard to win a championship. You can't allow anything else in your locker room, in the narrative. This team has done a good job of that,\" Myers said. \"I know it may appear as if it's looked easy over the last however many years. It's not. If you're in our locker room, if you're in our organization, it's hard.\n\n\"And so they'll get through it, and we'll keep moving. Hopefully we get to the finals and win a championship. That's all anybody's thinking about, because I think that's all you can think about. That's something that we're going to keep doing. This team has proven that they will do that and continue to do that and have done that.\"\n\nMyers and Kerr have long supported Green's fiery nature that leads to technical fouls. Myers even sat with Green next door to Oracle Arena at the Oakland Coliseum when Green was suspended for a crucial Game 5 loss to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals. The Warriors wound up losing in seven.\n\nGreen apologized after yelling at Kerr during halftime of a game at Oklahoma City in February 2016.\n\n\"My feeling on Draymond and his impact on our team doesn't change. These things happen sometimes over the course of an NBA season,\" Kerr said. \"We deal with it \u2014 again, internally \u2014 so any conversations that are happening or have happened it's our business.\"\n\nThis wasn't the first verbal altercation between Durant, the two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP, and Green. In another overtime loss, 109-106 at Sacramento on Feb. 4, 2017, they shouted at each other and argued near the bench.\n\n\"How you handle things after they happen is the most important thing,\" Myers said.\n\nKerr said he spoke to Green, who was part of the recruiting group that worked to sway Durant to the Bay Area from Oklahoma City before the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"They've won championships together, they've been teammates, now this is the third season, they were teammates on the Olympic team,\" Kerr said. \"Draw your own conclusions.\"\n\nGreen has been off to a strong start this season for the two-time defending NBA champions, averaging 7.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.4 assists. Kerr has credited him for taking great care of the ball and establishing a tempo on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe game at Los Angeles marked Green's return from a two-game absence with a sprained right foot and toe.\n\n\"Draymond is always going to be who he is. He's a powerful force,\" Kerr said. \"He's a huge reason why we've had so much success here.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Adrian Kraus) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 After Syracuse defeated Louisville in the home season finale Friday night, Orange coach Dino Babers brought the seniors out of the locker room to mingle one last time with their fans inside the Carrier Dome. Quarterback Eric Dungey lingered longer than most, snapping selfie after selfie with fans.\n\nIt was a moment to savor for one of the most dynamic players in school history as No. 12 Syracuse (8-2, 5-2 ACC) continued its return to respectability under the leadership of its third-year coach and his star quarterback.\n\n\"We've been through a lot,\" Dungey said. \"It's just been an incredible experience.\"\n\nThat skinny kid who was thrust into the season opener his freshman year when senior Terrel Hunt suffered a career-ending injury, then delivered a victory in his first college start the next week, has overcome at least one concussion and a broken foot to flourish at Syracuse. Dungey holds or shares 16 team records \u2014 from passing yards per game in a season (297.7) to career 300-yard passing games (10) to total offense per game for a season (330.2) and career (294.3) to most rushing yards in a game by a quarterback (200). He has 10,594 total yards, fifth all-time in the ACC, and needs just 71 yards rushing to reach 2,000 for his career.\n\n\"I think it's the confidence I have in myself,\" said Dungey, who starred at Lakeridge High School outside Portland, Oregon, but had few college suitors. \"I was under-recruited. Our confidence wasn't as high as it should have been.\n\n\"I just put everything I had into this team, this school. It just feels good to finally get some wins out of it.\"\n\nThose records have been achieved despite long absences due to injury by a player who has uncanny physical ability as a runner that's allowed him to hurdle over defenders . Or better yet, now that he's a 226-pound tower of muscle, run over them.\n\n\"He is an energized guy that I think has to have the respect of everybody on that team and the fans, too, because he plays the game like it's his last game,\" said Miami coach Mark Richt, a former quarterback. \"It's just impressive to see him operate.\"\n\nThat broken foot happened last fall early in Syracuse's game at Florida State . It didn't prevent Dungey from finishing the game and nearly leading the Orange to victory. His line: 24 completions for two touchdowns and 109 yards rushing and another score in a three-point loss.\n\n\"The energy we get from him is the way he competes. I mean, don't you get energy from the way he competes?\" Babers asked. \"When you're watching him, you're going, OMG. He's fearless. He's wreckless, and we love him.\"\n\nTo be sure, the injuries have been a major hindrance for the team because they've kept Dungey on the sideline for 10 entire games and most of another. In between, he's guided Syracuse to stunning home victories over Virginia Tech and Clemson , and two weeks ago he outdueled North Carolina State star Ryan Finley in a 51-41 victory over the No. 22 Wolfpack.\n\nDungey's final season has been injury-free. He's adapted his style, often sliding to safety instead of confronting tacklers head-on, and the high-powered offense has purred for the most part, averaging 44 points a game. But it has not been without its trials.\n\nThe broken foot opened a window for redshirt freshman backup Tommy DeVito to strut his stuff, and he has developed rapidly, taking first-string snaps in spring ball while Dungey was on the mend and mounting a challenge in preseason camp.\n\nThat experience has paid big dividends for the Orange. When Dungey faltered late and the Orange fell behind North Carolina three weeks ago, DeVito replaced him and led Syracuse to an overtime win as Dungey cheered from the sideline. DeVito also starred in a win over Florida State when Dungey had to sit because of blurred vision caused by a fragment from the artificial turf field.\n\nNow Dungey is poised for perhaps the biggest game of his career. The Orange face No. 3 Notre Dame (10-0) at Yankee Stadium on Saturday as the Irish chase a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nNo matter the outcome, the story of the likable kid from the West Coast, whose off-the-field antics included backflips off 20-foot ledges and plunges from 75-foot towers into the Willamette River, won't soon be forgotten.\n\n\"When this guy rolls out of here, there's going to be tall tales about him,\" Babers said. \"Everybody's going to say, 'Nah, he didn't do that.' The heck he didn't.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The conference's southern side enters the final two weeks in a jumble.\n\nHere are the possible scenarios at the moment: Utah (7-3, 5-3 Pac-12) can capture the division's berth in the conference championship game with a win Saturday in the rivalry game against Colorado in Boulder. But the Utes will need Arizona State to lose one of its last two games. The Utes finish the season with a nonconference game against BYU.\n\nThe Sun Devils (6-4, 4-3) have the most direct route to the title game, needing only to win both of their final games, at Oregon this Saturday and on the road against rival Arizona over the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nAnd Arizona (5-5, 4-3) can still pull off an upset by winning its final two games, at Washington State on Saturday and in the rivalry game, but the Wildcats will also need Utah to lose to the Buffaloes.\n\nThat Utah-Colorado game will happen early Saturday, so the Wildcats will know by the time they take the field against the No. 8 Cougars that night if they still have a shot.\n\n\"We have to be mature enough and be focused enough \u2014 which we have been the last couple of weeks with the way we played \u2014 to focus on the task at hand, which is Washington State,\" Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. \"So if you're worried about anything more than that, obviously that's going to affect your play. We've still got a lot of things out in front of us, but in order to have that in front of us, we've got to play very well in Pullman, the way we've played the last couple of weeks.\"\n\nMind-numbingly, it is possible for four teams to finish at 5-4 atop the conference. However, if that happens, and Arizona State has won the Territorial Cup, the Sun Devils have the tiebreaker. If ASU falls to Arizona, it goes to Utah.\n\nSo there's that.\n\nThere are a couple of other possibly less confusing things to consider down the stretch:\n\nHOTSEAT HELTON: USC eliminated itself from the conference championship conversation with last Saturday's 15-14 loss to California at the Coliseum.

The team was picked to finish first in the South in the Pac-12's preseason poll.\n\nWhile the most recent loss gave rise to speculation that Helton would be fired following the season, the coach said he has faith in his team and its future.\n\n\"I'm sorry for the 5-5 season right now. But better days are to come,\" Helton said. \"Programs I've seen across the country, win a Rose Bowl, win a Pac-12 Championship and then have an off season and then come right back. As a matter of a fact, we're going to compete against one of them in about two weeks. Sometimes you have a season that just doesn't go your way. I believe in this coaching staff, I believe in the leadership and in the players. Most of all I believe there are better days ahead.\"\n\nUSC's remaining games are against UCLA at the Rose Bowl on Saturday, and at home against Notre Dame on Nov. 24.\n\nRIVALRIES: It used to be that nearly all the teams had rivalry games on the final weekend of the regular season. This season, there are three rivalry games this weekend, including the Big Game between Cal and Stanford, the battle for the Victory Bell between USC and UCLA, and the Rumble in the Rockies between Utah and Colorado.\n\n\"I did get used to it for a long time, being the last game of the year, the last regular-season game. But I do understand a lot of people don't want to have it on the Thanksgiving weekend, they'd prefer not to have the Big Game on Thanksgiving weekend. So I can see it both ways,\" Stanford coach David Shaw said. \"But I've kind of gotten used to it now with the way that it's been with a game afterward. It doesn't cheapen the rivalry to me. This is a great week with a lot of festivities.\"\n\nOH, AND ABOUT THE NORTH: It's not settled either. But all signs point to the Apple Cup. Both the Cougars and the Huskies control their own destinies, meaning that whichever team wins out will get the championship game berth.\n\nWashington State (9-1, 6-1) hosts Arizona on Saturday, while Washington (7-3, 5-2) hosts Oregon State. Both seemingly winnable games.\n\nThe Apple Cup is set for Black Friday in Pullman.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Gall took an unusual path in his soccer career, leaving the United States to play for a third-division Swedish team in a city of 32,000 and moving into the house of the club's chairman. The 23-year-old midfielder could make his American national debut Thursday against England at Wembley. (AP Photo/John Raoux, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSigned with fanfare by Columbus 18 months earlier, Romain Gall was released by the Crew in February 2016 after making just four first-team appearances in 1\u00bd seasons. Just 21 years old, the midfielder had seen his hopes with Major League Soccer and the U.S. under-20 national team crater.\n\nA little more than a month later, he signed with Nykopings, a third-tier team in a city of about 30,000 on Sweden's Baltic coast, south of Stockholm. With no place to stay at first, he moved into a room in the house of the club's chairman.\n\n\"My path was different because I went down three levels to then come back up,\" he said Tuesday. \"I don't think a lot of people are willing to do that or even have the idea of doing that. And of course it wasn't central Europe, so I can understand that it's a path that not many players were willing to take.\"\n\nNow with Malmo, a top club in Sweden's first tier, Gall is training with the U.S. national team in London and could make his debut in Thursday's exhibition against England at Wembley Stadium.\n\n\"He had been off the radar a little bit and sort of re-emerged this year,\" U.S. interim coach Dave Sarachan said. \"He has put himself in the conversation with the minutes he's getting and his consistent production this season. He is an intriguing player in the attacking third.\"\n\nGall's father, Thierry, works for Orange Communications, the former France Telecom. With wife Saida and three kids, the family kept moving back and forth between the U.S. and France until settling in Herndon, Virginia, when Romain was 7.\n\nRomain, who was born in Paris, played with Herndon Youth Soccer and trained occasionally at D.C. United's academy when he was 13 and 14. He moved to Real Salt Lake Arizona, an academy in Casa Grande, Arizona, when he was 15 and spent a little over a year there. Wanting to train at a higher level, he went back to France and joined Lorient's academy in 2011 at age 16.\n\n\"My father came with me in the beginning to help me get settled, but then it was just me on my own,\" he said.\n\nHaving failed to break into Lorient's first team, he signed with the Crew in August 2014 and coach Gregg Berhalter called him \"a strong addition.\" He made his debut on Aug. 23 as a second-half substitute against Houston and had two more appearances, both as second-half subs.\n\nThe following January, Gall scored five goals for the U.S. at the CONCACAF Under-20 Championship, including a hat trick against Aruba and two versus Jamaica, tying Mexico's Hirving Lozano for the tournament lead. He played alongside several of the players who have become part of the rebuilding U.S. national team in the past year, including Zack Steffen, Cameron Carter-Vickers, Matt Miazga and Paul Arriola.\n\nBut Gall was dropped that May from the roster for the Under-20 World Cup in New Zealand. He hadn't gotten into a match with the Crew all season and had been slowed by a knee injury.\n\n\"It hurt at the time,\" he said, unable to recall exactly what U-20 coach Tab Ramos told him.\n\nHe made just one appearance with the Crew in 2015, in a U.S. Open Cup match that June, and played 12 games on loan with the Austin Aztex of the third-tier United Soccer League. And then he was cut by the Crew and made the move to Sweden.\n\n\"I wanted to go back to Europe,\" he said. \"At the time, that was the only option that was presented to me. It was a tough decision. I knew that if I had to go there, I had to focus completely and move up as quickly as possible, because it was the third division in Sweden.\"\n\nHe scored nine goals in 24 league games with Nykopings, then moved to first-tier Sundsvall and had nine more in 37 league matches over 1\u00bd seasons. He transferred to defending champion Malmo, scored six goals in 13 league games and got to play in Champions League qualifying and the Europa League group stage.\n\n\"It's nice to see him blossom in Sweden,\" Miazga said. \"Romain's a very technical and skillful player. He has a lot of creativity.\"\n\nBerhalter, his old Crew coach, is the favorite to take over the U.S. national team. He has a chance to earn playing time in next year's CONCACAF Gold Cup and in World Cup qualifying.\n\n\"It's been a grind, really tough,\" Gall said. \"But now it's paying off.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The Chiefs won 26-14. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Patrick Mahomes walked off the field at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday with another record on his resume and the Kansas City Chiefs another win toward earning the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nHe didn't have much chance to savor any of it.\n\nMahomes quickly learned that the stepfather of his longtime girlfriend, Brittany Matthews, had died after a medical emergency during the game. Mahomes quickly skipped out on the postgame celebration and joined Matthews, who posted the sobering news on her social media accounts that evening.\n\n\"Today is a day I will never forget,\" she wrote in the caption of a photo. \"Directly after this picture I sprinted to the front entrance to see my stepdad passed out! He did not come back from this and he was called to heaven today! I KNOW 100 (percent) he is so happy up there with his kids looking down on us, cheering loud that his Chiefs won today!\"\n\nMahomes is not expected to miss any preparation for Monday night's showdown with the Rams in Los Angeles, though Chiefs coach Andy Reid said he would be fine if it happens.\n\nThe Chiefs were off Tuesday and Wednesday, giving Mahomes and his family time to cope.\n\n\"We're sorry to hear about what took place,\" Reid said. \"Prayers and blessings are with the family. I talked to Patrick and they're doing well for the circumstances that took place. As they go through this mourning period our thoughts and prayers are with them.\"\n\nThis season has already been a whirlwind for Mahomes, who was thrust into the starting job after the trade of Alex Smith to Washington and whose ability was justifiably questioned.\n\nHe was a product of the Texas Tech offensive system. His big arm was tempered by problems with his accuracy. He had leadership abilities, but could they translate from college to the NFL?\n\nMahomes has answered all those questions every week.\n\nHe threw six touchdown passes in a game. He led the Chiefs to tough road wins over the Chargers and Steelers, and went toe-to-toe with Tom Brady in New England. He has thrown so few interceptions that any questions about his decision-making have been left in September.\n\nWith two more TD passes against the Cardinals, he broke the franchise single-season record of 30 that Hall of Fame quarterback Len Dawson set during the 1964 season \u2014 with six games to go.\n\n\"Pat is just a competitor,\" Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt said, \"and a great guy and he's always trying to win. We needed all 31 of those touchdowns and he got them.\"\n\nWell, the Chiefs probably didn't need all of them.\n\nThe Chiefs have scored 353 points through their first 10 games, the most in club history, and have been held to fewer than 30 only twice. Three times they've scored more than 40, including their 43-40 loss to the Patriots that remains the only blemish on their record.\n\nTo put into perspective just how good Mahomes has been this season, consider this: He threw for 249 yards against the Cardinals for a passer rating of 125.4, the eighth time this season he's been over 100.0 \u2014 the third most in a single season in franchise history.\n\nYet some people considered the end of his streak of eight consecutive 300-yard passing games to be a relative disappointment, as if he failed to live up to some otherworldly expectation.\n\nHis teammates certainly weren't in that camp.\n\n\"That's something I'd do on 'Madden,'\" wide receiver Tyreek Hill said of Mahomes' TD record. \"For him to come in and do that, that's amazing. A lot of people doubted him, saying he wasn't going to do this or wasn't going to do that. He's shutting a lot of people up right now and I'm proud of him. He's just got to continue to move forward and stay humble. He'll be all right.\"\n\nHe's been far better than that this season.\n\nOddsmakers in Las Vegas have made the 23-year-old Mahomes the front-runner to win the league's MVP award, ahead of Saints quarterback Drew Brees and Rams running back Todd Gurley. And if he keeps going at his current rate, he will no doubt continue to rewrite the Chiefs record book.\n\nMaybe even the page that lists the Chiefs' rather unimpressive postseason history.\n\n\"Listen, he's had a heck of a year,\" Reid said. \"Comes out every day bringing energy and he makes sure that he has his things in order. When he does that, and he's got a lot on his plate as far as responsibility goes to run that offense, and he takes care of that. He's in a position where he can make everyone better around him, and he's doing that. I'm proud of him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Green ended up turning the ball over and the game went to overtime.\n\nDuring the break between the fourth quarter and the start of overtime, Durant yelled at Green for not passing him the ball. The fiery Green didn\u2019t appreciate the comments and had words for Durant.

There is widespread speculation that Durant will leave the Warriors, especially if he wins another title. Multiple Eastern Conference executives believe Durant will sign with the rebuilding New York Knicks.\n\nBefore Tuesday night's game, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Durant's impending free agency \u2014 and his noncommittal approach \u2014 hasn't caused any locker room issues.\n\n\"Not the slightest bit,\" he said. \"Nobody ever talks about Kevin's free agency.

Durant was named Finals MVP both times.\n\nThe dust-up reveals just how difficult it is to maintain chemistry and keep winning, even for a team as talented as the Warriors, who are trying to win their third title in a row and their fourth in five seasons.\n\nWarriors general manager Bob Myers told reporters Tuesday he wasn't sure if Durant and Green had talked since the confrontation.\n\n\"If they haven't talked, I'm sure that they will talk,\" he said. \"I know both of them.

Sherrill defeated Republican opponent Jay Webber in New Jersey's 11th congressional district. EPA-EFE/JUSTIN LANE ORG XMIT: JLX37 (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE)\n\nWhen she was at the United States Naval Academy learning to fly helicopters, Mikie Sherrill dreaded the dunker drill.\n\nTo prepare its officers for anything, the Academy would strap Sherrill and other trainees into a makeshift helicopter, drop them into a tank of water, turn the helicopter upside down and give them an order: Prove you can get out before you drown.\n\nOnce trainees mastered that task, the Academy threw in another wrinkle. They had to escape blindfolded.\n\nSo on the campaign trail the last few months, as she worked to convince voters she was the best candidate to represent New Jersey\u2019s 11th Congressional District, Sherrill was frequently reminded of her resilience anytime she hit a snag in her election or had a rough day. And typically, that reminder came in the form of a text message, usually from another female service candidate.\n\nLast week, a record-breaking 102 women were elected to the House of Representatives. That historic number includes a handful of female veterans and other service candidates, many of whom befriended each other on the campaign trail, fundraised together and ultimately dubbed themselves \u201cThe Badasses,\u201d creating a group text where they went to bond, compare strategies, share funny photos and vent. The women, all Democrats, plan to extend that support to one another in Washington, D.C., where they hope to push each other through bad days at work and early-morning bootcamp workouts.\n\nMore: Forget the pantsuit. In 2018, 'badass' female candidates show strength after decades of being told how to look, sound and act\n\nThe group text was not the place to go if you were looking for sympathy, however.\n\n\u201cEspecially those last two weeks, when you\u2019re getting down to the wire and the intensity of the campaign is heating up and maybe you\u2019re starting to have doubts, if you voice those, this group was very much in the spirit of, \u2018Drop and give me 20!\u2019\u201d said Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst and member of the Badasses who won her bid for Michigan\u2019s 8th Congressional District. \u201cIt was all about, \u2018Get your s--- together, stand up straight and move out.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat tone worked, Slotkin said, because these women had already proved they thrived in challenging environments and could handle tough talk. In fact, they often responded better to it.\n\nElissa Slotkin, Democratic candidate for U.S. House of Representatives, fills out her voting card before casting her ballot at the Karl Richter Community Center during election day in Holly, Mich., on Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018. (Clarence Tabb Jr./Detroit News via AP) ORG XMIT: MIDTN101 (Photo: Clarence Tabb Jr., AP)\n\nOn election night, the Military Times tracked 173 veterans running for office, including 14 women. At least one of those races, the Texas 23rd Congressional District, where Air Force ROTC veteran and Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones is running, is still too close to call. Late Monday night, Republican Rep. Martha McSally, a retired Air Force pilot up for a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona, conceded to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nStill, D.C. is about to get an influx of tough, battle-tested women.\n\nCampaigns, said newly elected Democratic Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania\u2019s 6th District, can be isolating experiences. Having other women around who understood the challenges of being a first-time candidate helps you feel like you\u2019re not \u201cstuck on a silo\u201d and \u201cmade the process more humane.\u201d When phones would ping with pictures of 6 a.m. family pumpkin-carving contests, or the bizarre realization that as a public figure someone might dress up like you for Halloween \u2013 that happened to a couple of them \u2013- everyone on the text chain understood because they were living a different version of normal.\n\n\u201cThe Badasses\u201d shared a background of service, but also had experience in putting country before party, a critical talking point when trying to attract voters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily distinguish female and veteran,\u201d Houlahan said. \u201cBut I think females and veterans bring something similar, which is a sense of teamwork and collaboration, which is lacking in government right now.\u201d\n\nMaybe, she added with a laugh, you get some sort of super candidate if you put those two labels together.\n\nThe group started when Houlahan and Slotkin \u2013 running in races more than 600 miles apart \u2013 realized they had overlapping donors. With the help of Serve America, a political action committee dedicated to getting more veterans in elected office, they organized \u201cThe Badass Tour.\u201d A series of fundraising events that brought together service candidates, the hope was that first-time donors uneasy about contributing money to just one person might be more inclined to donate if they saw a group of veterans working together. The women got cash for their campaigns and formed a quick friendship.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we\u2019ve always wanted women veterans to run,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY\u2019s List, an organization that recruits and works to elect pro-choice, female candidates. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to get us to this incredible moment is that there were women who had served who were deeply concerned about the lack of international leadership the Trump administration and this Republican Party was providing. They were not going to watch this country that they\u2019ve fought for go completely off the rails.\n\n\u201cThese are women deeply concerned about the United States\u2019 positioning in the world,\u201d she added, \u201cand these are exactly the voices we need in Congress.\u201d\n\nMore: New 'Year of the Woman'? Over 100 female candidates set to win seats in Congress, make history\n\nFor the past few years, the female veteran most often in the spotlight has been U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., a former U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who lost both legs when her helicopter was shot down during the Iraq War.\n\nAs a congresswoman, Duckworth introduced both the Troop Talent Act and the Clay Hunt SAV Act, which helps veterans and service members obtain civilian certifications for skills they built in the military and helps prevent veteran suicide, respectively. Both became law.\n\nBefore getting into office, Duckworth worked as the assistant secretary of Veterans Affairs under President Barack Obama and was the director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs, where she started a program to help veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and veterans with brain injuries. As a senator, she called Trump a \"draft dodger\" who hasn't adequately funded the military.\n\n\"Female veterans are proven leaders,\" Duckworth told USA TODAY this week in an email. \"They\u2019ve already shown that women can perform at the highest levels, and that matters to voters, both male and female. ... Veterans are people you can talk to who will cut through the (bull) because we come from a common background of non-partisan service. We know what it means to have each other\u2019s backs.\"\n\nSherrill said it\u2019s important, first and foremost, to elect more women, period. Women who understand the inner workings of the military and intelligence services are just a bonus.\n\n\u201cThere are too many times our issues and our voices haven\u2019t been heard,\u201d Sherrill said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking specifically right now of Sen. (Kirsten) Gillibrand and Sen. Annie McLane Kuster, who were some of the only people willing to talk about and investigate military sexual assault.\n\n\u201cWe need to be able to advocate for ourselves.\u201d\n\nTo Elaine Luria, who served 20 years as a Navy surface warfare officer and will represent Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, the decision to run for public office was obvious. After all, she said, on your first day at the Naval Academy you memorize the mission statement, which includes the phrase, \u201cdevelop midshipmen \u2026 so as to assume the highest responsibilities of command, citizenship and government.\u201d\n\nDiversifying Congress is important, said Schriock at EMILY\u2019s List, because it helps young women understand what\u2019s possible for them. And she anticipates that the infusion of service candidates will resonate with a few communities in particular.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be really important to rural America,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a lot of folks, the military is sometimes the only path to financial security or education. Gina Ortiz Jones is a perfect example \u2013 she joined ROTC right away to get financial help, then served, and now, she might be going to Congress.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the possibility that Ortiz Jones could lose.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSix teams \u2014 including all of the AFC East \u2014 are off this week. But besides the Patriots, no other team has essential fantasy starters to replace.\n\nSan Francisco's break forces you to fill in for running back Matt Breida and tight end George Kittle. Cleveland's only regular fantasy starters are Nick Chubb and Jarvis Landry. Still, you must deftly navigate the waiver wire for potential playoff contributors, especially with trade deadlines about to pass in most leagues.\n\nRUNNING BACKS\n\nJAYLEN SAMUELS, Steelers (Owned in 0.2 percent of leagues): Le'Veon Bell is no longer relevant in Pittsburgh, so now is the time to grab James Conner's handcuff. When Conner left last week's game against the Panthers, Samuels scored his first NFL touchdown. This is the time of year to start cutting players from your bench that you will never comfortably start and roster the immediate backups of your best RBs.\n\nTHEO RIDDICK, Lions (19.5): He has started to re-emerge since the Lions traded Golden Tate, working in the slot and replacing the departed WR as a key target to move the chains. Riddick is purely an add in point-per-reception leagues, but a viable one. The upside is not high, but with 13 catches for 96 yards in his last two games, there is an adequate floor for your flex spot.\n\nRASHAAD PENNY, Seahawks (13.1): The rookie delivered his best performance to date in Week 10, rushing for 108 yards on a dozen carries and registering his first NFL scoring run. Penny displayed the explosive abilities that made him a first round pick. But you have to be patient with him, as Chris Carson may return to the mix and Mike Davis is the team's best receiver at RB. Penny may ride your bench in the near future as part of a committee, but Carson is oft-injured and Penny may eventually ascend because he is the most talented RB of the three.\n\nWIDE RECEIVERS\n\nANTHONY MILLER, Bears (13.4): Another potentially explosive rookie, Miller is healthy and starting to make his presence felt in the rapidly improving Chicago offense. He came through with his best performance so far in Week 10, catching five passes for 122 yards and a TD. Miller has scored twice in his last three games and three in his last five. He has yet to display a wider range of his big-play skills, and he may soon approach fantasy WR3 status.\n\nDONTE MONCRIEF, Jaguars (15.1); Fantasy owners seem to avoid Jacksonville WRs as a rule, but Moncrief has at least performed respectably enough to make him a quality bye week and injury fill-in. In a dire situation, if you have to start Moncrief, he will provide good enough PPR numbers. He has four double-figure PPR performances in his past six games, and two of those have been 20-point outings.\n\nJOSH REYNOLDS, Rams (1.1): Cooper Kupp is done for the year with a knee injury, so you have to take a cautious flier on Reynolds again, who was mediocre in terms of catches and yardage last time Kupp was out but did deliver a two-TD game in Week 8. Reynolds will be fourth, and maybe even fifth in targets for the Rams now, but you have to take a waiver shot on a player with more possible opportunity in a great offense.\n\nTIGHT ENDS\n\nJONNU SMITH, Titans (0.6): Marcus Mariota has started to raise his game recently, and Smith has been involved enough to make savvy fantasy owners raise an eyebrow. Smith has scored in each of his past two games and has the abilities to start contributing more often on key passing downs.\n\nGERALD EVERETT, Rams (1.4): The Los Angeles tight ends could also benefit from the absence of Kupp. Everett scored in Week 10 and along with Tyler Higbee, could start to get more offensive attention from Jared Goff in the weeks ahead.\n\nNICK VANNETT, Seahawks (9.5): He has scored in two consecutive games, as he is getting more attention from Russell Wilson in red zone situations. He's not much more than a TE2 in fantasy but can certainly fill in on a bye week.\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nLAMAR JACKSON, Ravens (6.7): Injury issues and mediocre play appear to be putting Joe Flacco on the hot seat. While Robert Griffin III could get a chance to move in first, Jackson should get his chance if the Ravens get booted out of the playoff race soon, and his dual threat abilities will make him an intriguing fantasy option.\n\n___\n\nFor more Week 11 fantasy advice, visit RotoExperts: https://rotoexperts.com\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Lee Westwood and Matt Kuchar won last week, each ending four-plus years without winning on their home circuit. They also won without their regular caddies.\n\nKuchar used a local caddie at Mayakoba because he entered at the last minute and his regular looper, John Wood, had a previous engagement. Westwood used his girlfriend, Helen Storey, who previously caddied for him in Denmark.\n\nWood is back to work with Kuchar this week at the Australian Open. Billy Foster's 10-year run with Westwood is done.\n\n\"Mine and Billy's working relationship had got to a point where neither of us were gaining anything from it and we weren't doing each other any good,\" Westwood said Tuesday at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. \"I sat him down and said, 'This is no good, I'm playing better when you're not there than when you are there, so something's obviously not working.' He said to me, 'Well, I can't caddie for you how I want to caddie for you.'\"\n\nWestwood said he has reached a stage in his career where he doesn't need as much from his caddie, and he felt Foster wasn't happy just carrying the bag.\n\n\"It just was one of those things that had to come to an end,\" Westwood said. \"We've obviously had a great time the last 10 years and been very successful, but people change and the way you work and look at things.\"\n\nFoster is working with Matt Fitzpatrick in Dubai. Westwood is using Glen Murray, who was on the bag with Sergio Garcia when the Spaniard won the Masters.\n\nBRITISH OPEN QUALIFYING\n\nThe road to the Masters also will cut a path toward Northern Ireland for the British Open.\n\nWith the PGA Championship moving to May, the R&A has changed up the sites and dates of \"The Open Qualifying Series,\" with the biggest change on the PGA Tour. Last year, the three PGA Tour events leading up to The Open offered nine spots to players not already exempt \u2014 at two tournaments, four spots from the top 12 on the leaderboard, and one spot at the John Deere Classic.\n\nNow, three spots to the leading 10 players not already exempt are being offered at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill on March 7-10. Three spots are being awarded at the Canadian Open on June 6-9. Two spots are being awarded at the new Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit on June 27-30. The John Deere Classic still gets one spot a week before the British Open at Royal Portrush.\n\nEurope's schedule has not changed, only the tournaments. Three spots to the leading 10 players will be awarded in each of three tournaments leading to The Open \u2014 the Andalucia Valderrama Masters, the Irish Open and the Scottish Open.\n\nA total of 46 qualifying spots are offered around the world for the 156-man field, starting this week at the Australian Open.\n\nEVERY SHOT MATTERS\n\nEmiliano Grillo rapped a 3-foot bogey putt on the final hole at Mayakoba that popped around the lip and spun out, leaving him stunned. He made double bogey for a 69 that dropped him from a six-way tie for 10th to alone in 15th place.\n\nThat was worth $35,400. It cost him nine FedEx Cup points. That happens every week.\n\nThis late in the year, it cost the Argentine 0.83 world ranking points. Instead of being at No. 46, Grillo moved up to No. 48. That's important because the top 50 at the end of the year get into the Masters, and he'll have to wait to see if that putt ends up costing him a certain invitation.\n\nThen again, Grillo is playing the Dunlop Phoenix in Japan this week and could make it a moot point.\n\nFIELD BOOST\n\nThe Australian Open doesn't have Jordan Spieth for the first time since 2013, though it attracted a strong group of Americans that include Matt Kuchar, Keegan Bradley and Brandt Snedeker. Kuchar is staying in Australia next week for the World Cup of Golf.\n\nNext year, the Australian Open could get even more star power.\n\nOrganizers announced Tuesday that it will be held Dec. 5-8, one week before the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.\n\nWhen the Presidents Cup last was in Australia in 2011, 13 players from the U.S. and International teams competed in golf's fifth-oldest championship. That group included Tiger Woods, who will be the Presidents Cup captain next year.\n\n\"This is great news for the Australian Open and we're excited about what this means for Australian golf fans,\" Golf Australia chief executive Stephen Pitt said.\n\nWORLD DISABILITIES RANKING\n\nGolfers with disabilities are getting their own world ranking.\n\nThe R&A and the USGA announced Tuesday the World Ranking for Golfers with Disability for men and women, starting in January. The World Amateur Golf Ranking will administer both sites. The governing bodies agreed to take over the program that the European Disabled Golfers Association created in 2014.\n\n\"There is an accelerating growth in the number of events around the world for golfers with disabilities to compete in, so it makes absolute sense that there is a global ranking to provide a robust measurement of an individual's skill and ability,\" said Duncan Weir, head of golf development and amateur events for the R&A. \"It is another important step toward ensuring that golf is more inclusive of people of all ages and abilities.\"\n\nThe announcement coincided with the Australian All Abilities Championship, in which 12 golfers are playing alongside pros at the Australian Open this week.\n\nTRAVELING MAN\n\nAnother week, another golf course for Padraig Harrington.\n\nAnother country, too.\n\nThe RSM Classic at Sea Island is the ninth tournament in 10 weeks for Harrington, which includes his role as vice captain at the Ryder Cup. He started at the KLM Open in The Netherlands and since has gone to Portugal, France, Scotland, England and Spain. After a week off, he resumed at the Turkish Airlines Open and the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa before arriving on the Georgia coast.\n\nThe PGA Tour is done for the year. And he is not scheduled to play the European Tour opener in Hong Kong.\n\nDIVOTS\n\nBoth Americans among the top five in the Race to Dubai, Patrick Reed and Xander Schauffele, are playing the DP World Tour Championship this week. This will be the first regular European Tour event for Schauffele. ... Matt Kuchar with his victory became the 10th player to surpass $45 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour. ... Luke Donald, who was No. 1 in the world for 56 weeks in 2011 and 2012, fell out of the top 500 in the world this week for the first time since the start of 2002. ...

Georgia Tech won 27-21. (AP Photo/John Amis) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Tech was headed for a dismal season.\n\nSuddenly, it looks a lot more promising.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets have ripped off three straight victories, locked up a bowl trip and could clinch a winning season with a victory Saturday over Virginia.\n\n\"It's like I always tell the team, 'It's never as good or as bad as it seems,'\" coach Paul Johnson said Tuesday. \"Very few teams in America are going to show up every week and blow people out. There's too much parity in college football these days. If you play clean and make plays, you've got a chance to be successful. If you don't, that other thing happens.\"\n\nGeorgia Tech (6-4, 4-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) started the season 1-3, which included blowing a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter at South Florida and a rout at the hands of No. 2 Clemson . When the Yellow Jackets lost at home to lowly Duke , a third losing season in four years seemed likely and many wondered if Johnson's long tenure on the Flats was winding down.\n\nBut they bounced back with a dominating 49-28 win at Virginia Tech \u2014 without completing a pass, no less \u2014 before pulling out nail-biting wins over North Carolina and Miami the last two weeks.\n\n\"This league is so balanced,\" Johnson said. \"Other than Clemson, everybody is pretty similar. If you don't play well, you can lose. That's kind of the way it is for everybody.\"\n\nPittsburgh, which handed Georgia Tech its other loss early in the season , is on the cusp of wrapping up the ACC Coastal Division title, so that goal is pretty much out of reach.\n\nBut a victory over Virginia would give the Yellow Jackets a winning mark in the conference for the first time since 2014. Plus, it would improve their position within the ACC bowl hierarchy.\n\nThe seniors, who helped to hold the team together when things looked bleak, are eager to keep the turnaround going.\n\n\"We got to six. Cool. We get to go to a bowl game,\" receiver Brad Stewart said. \"But at the end of the day, we're still hungry. We want more.\"\n\nAlways a run-dominated team out of the triple-option, the Yellow Jackets have essentially shut down any pretense of a passing game over these last three games, attempting only seven passes and completing five for 177 yards.\n\nMeanwhile, they've averaged nearly 386 yards on the ground during that span, a big reason they've dominated time of possession with an average of 37:45 per game.\n\n\"If the other team doesn't have the ball,\" Johnson said with a smile, \"it's hard to score.\"\n\nVirginia will certainly need to do a better job against the triple-option than it did in last season's Military Bowl, when Navy ran all over the Cavaliers in a 49-7 rout . The Midshipmen failed to complete their only pass attempt but rushed for 452 yards, a game plan that Georgia Tech would certainly like to duplicate.\n\n\"It's unique. You don't see it week in and week out,\" Virginia linebacker Jordan Mack said. \"It's one week, and you've got to abandon everything you know essentially and just focus in on the offense.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers did a better job when they faced Georgia Tech last season in Charlottesville. They limited the Jackets to 220 yards rushing, picked off a pair of passes and pulled out a 40-36 victory on a 27-yard touchdown pass with 1:22 remaining .\n\nWith that win, Virginia locked up its first bowl appearance in six years.\n\n\"That was very satisfying,\" defensive lineman Eli Hanback said. \"It was a hard-fought game, it was a rainy game, it was tough. It was very sweet, at the end of the game, having won.

But we knew we were getting closer.\"\n\nThe Bulls have gone beyond what few could have envisioned in transforming themselves from long-time pushovers \u2014 this is their third winning season since joining the MAC in 1999 \u2014 to a formidable powerhouse while getting votes in the national polls.\n\nWith two games left, starting with a trip to Ohio (6-4, 4-2 MAC) on Wednesday night, Buffalo needs one win to clinch the East Division title and only its second berth in the conference championship game.\n\nAnd the Bulls have all but assured themselves of what would be the program's fourth bowl berth, including in 1958, when Buffalo players elected not to take part in the Tangerine Bowl because the team's two black players were not allowed to participate.\n\nJackson hasn't forgotten how low things became in 2016.\n\n\"I think that's something that actually kind of motivates you still,\" said the junior quarterback, whose 24 touchdowns passing are five shy of Buffalo's single-season record.\n\n\"I'll always keep that with me, and keep that chip on my shoulder,\" Jackson said. \"I never want to feel that way again.\"\n\nAnother motivating factor is how last season ended. Buffalo won its final three games to finish 6-6 before getting snubbed in the bowl-selection process.\n\n\"That's something we definitely talk about: Leave no doubt,\" center James O'Hagan said in September. \"Getting six wins isn't enough, and we can't leave it up to other people to decide our fate.\"\n\nThey've left nothing to chance this year.\n\nJackson oversees a dynamic dual-threat offense averaging a little over 36 points and 427 yards per game.\n\nOne week, the Bulls are winning with their passing attack. Johnson scored three times and set a school record with 238 yards receiving in a 51-42 win over Miami (Ohio) on Oct. 30.\n\nThe following week, it's their ground game. Freshman Jaret Patterson had 187 yards rushing and two touchdowns in a 48-14 win over Kent State on Nov. 6.\n\nAnd Buffalo's stingy defense is allowing a MAC-low 328 yards per outing.\n\nThe Bulls have won 12 of their past 13, dating to last season, with the lone blemish a 42-13 home loss to Army on Sept. 29.\n\nWith a 22-24 record, Leipold already ranks fourth among Buffalo coaches in career victories.\n\nBefore being hired by Buffalo, Leipold went 109-6 over eight seasons at Division III Wisconsin-Whitewater.\n\nWhen asked to put this season's success into perspective, Leipold reflected back to his first full-time coaching job as an assistant at Division II Nebraska-Omaha. The Mavericks, whose program has since been discontinued, went 1-10 in his first season, 1994, before winning the North Central Conference championship with a 10-2 record two years later.\n\n\"A lot of hard work, a lot of heartache,\" he recalled. \"That was my most rewarding time in coaching. I always felt we took something that wasn't very good and we made it into a consistent winner.\"\n\nLeipold is doing it again in Buffalo.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY Sports\n\nPittsburgh Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell (26) reacts to the crowd before playing the Tennessee Titans at Heinz Field. (Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAfter months of speculation, misdirection and confusion, the moment of truth came for Le\u2019Veon Bell. In the end, the running back stood firm.\n\nThe long game took priority over the short.\n\nTuesday\u2019s 4 p.m. deadline for Bell to report to the Pittsburgh Steelers passed without any deal. By remaining away, the 26-year-old is ineligible to play the remainder of the season. He\u2019ll also officially forfeit the entire $14.54 million that he would have earned had he signed his second consecutive franchise tag.\n\nThis never was about a one-year payout for Bell, who through his five previous NFL season has earned a total of $16.04 million.\n\nBell sees himself as more than a typical running back, a position usually not as highly prized as a top quarterback, wide receiver, pass rusher or left tackle. That\u2019s why a multi-year deal with an average salary of $14 million (although not 100 percent guaranteed) offered by the Steelers last offseason wasn't enough for him.\n\nBut taking the field without long-term financial security was also unappealing. He played two seasons with no salary promised for the following year, enduring the risk of a serious injury that could have damaged his future earning potential. To Bell, that was two seasons too many.\n\nBell wasn\u2019t going to put himself through the rigors of another 400-plus touch season ahead of free agency. And even though reporting this week would have translated into a significantly lighter load, and a prorated $6 million, Bell still was comfortable deciding to sit out.\n\nNow, he\u2019ll enter the offseason as a free agent, unless the Steelers use the franchise tag a third time (unlikely given the cost is expected to exceed $25 million) or transition tag (possible, because it gives them the right to match any offer he receives).\n\nAsk former and current NFL players, and even agents and contract experts, and many find it hard to understand Bell\u2019s end game. Despite his clear desire to maximize his potential payout for a deal next spring, it's hard to comprehend his decision to forfeit $14.5 million just to keep himself fresh for future seasons.\n\nWhen Bell didn\u2019t end his holdout in time to rejoin his team by Week 1 as he did last season, many expected him to wait until this point because it was the last date possible for him to squeeze out some of his salary and still help the Steelers make a run to the Super Bowl.\n\nBut nothing about Bell\u2019s approach has been predictable.\n\nEarlier this season, reports emerged that he planned to return during Pittsburgh\u2019s Week 7 bye. That didn\u2019t happen. Last week, he left his offseason home of Miami and returned to the Pittsburgh area, where he trained in local gyms but still didn\u2019t rejoin the Steelers. That left some to believe a Week 11 return was possible.\n\nThen, Tuesday came and went with no sign of Bell.\n\nConfusing? Yes, on the surface. Fans, players and experts have all wondered what kind of advice Bell is receiving from his agent, Adisa Bakari. But multiple people familiar with both figures told USA TODAY Sports that they believe these moves are Bell\u2019s alone. The people spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nVery little about Bell is conventional \u2013 not his running style, not his mental approach to the game and not his financial decisions.\n\nBell has never taken the ball and just hit the intended hole as running backs are instructed. Instead, he routinely hesitates, his eyes looking beyond the line to read linebackers, trying to identify his second and third moves, and then he springs into action. That running style frustrates defenders who read the offensive linemen to ascertain a read on Bell\u2019s intentions and then get duped. Bell\u2019s running style also frustrates his own coaches and blockers. But it\u2019s just that: his own unique approach.\n\nThe game of football is a chess match to Bell. So, too, is the business side of football, which now has Bell in a position he likely did not previously envision.\n\nIt was five years ago that Bell tweeted, \u201cIf youu (sic) could sit out a year of a sport youu play and your not injured or somethin else is preventing you to play, then youu don\u2019t love it!\u201d\n\nIf youu could sit out a year of a sport youu play and your not injured or somethin else is preventing youu to play, then youu don't love it! \u2014 Le'Veon Bell (@LeVeonBell) February 13, 2013\n\nBut now, while faced with the dilemma of laying his body on the line for less than he believes he is worth and without sufficient long-term security, Bell is using the very tactic he once criticized.\n\nBell\u2019s unwillingness to play under these circumstances is understandable given he saw Earl Thomas end a lengthy contract holdout earlier this year only to break his leg four games into his season. Then last week, Dez Bryant at last signed with the Saints before tearing his Achilles in his second practice.\n\nIn accordance with his running style, rather than looking at the hole (or one-year contract) right in front of him, Bell is looking to the next level. A degree of uncertainty does loom, though.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that Bell will receive the kind of money he seeks from another team.\n\nMany teams might hesitate to give the soon-to-be 27-year-old a multi-year deal worth approximately $16 million per season, in part because it\u2019s hard to predict when a running back\u2019s production will drop off. The Adrian Peterson and Frank Gore types are extremely rare. Bell has put up all-pro numbers and seemingly boasts special talent. But he does have a lot of mileage on him, and there\u2019s no guarantee he will continue to produce at his previous level.\n\nBut he only needs one team to step up with the offer he's been looking for. And if Bell finds that ideal scenario, his stand of 2018 will have been well worth it.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.", "Iowa head coach Kirk Ferentz, left, watches a replay during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Northwestern, Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Iowa City, Iowa. Northwestern won 14-10. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nIowa junior tight end Noah Fant is one of the most talented players that Kirk Ferentz has ever coached in his 20 years.\n\nSo why isn't Iowa (6-4, 3-4 Big Ten) getting Fant the ball more?\n\nIt is a perplexing question in an increasingly disappointing season in Iowa City. The issue came to a head last week in a 14-10 loss to Northwestern, Iowa's third straight defeat after a 6-1 start.\n\nFant, the team leader with six touchdown catches, had just one catch for zero yards as the Hawkeyes let its final chance to remain alive in the Big Ten West race slip away. It was the fourth straight game without a TD grab by Fant.\n\nThe Hawkeyes head to Illinois (4-6, 2-5) on Saturday looking to resurrect its season and Fant's role in their offense, especially considering he might leave for the NFL.\n\n\"We'll try to keep him involved and get him involved. But he's a good football player. We're going to be a better team if we can get him the ball,\" Ferentz said of Fant.\n\nFerentz said Tuesday that the Hawkeyes have focused more on emerging sophomore T.J. Hockenson in recent weeks because of Hockenson's versatility, adding that they see Fant as more of a \"specialist.\"\n\nHockenson has been excellent, with 39 catches for 615 yards and five total TDs. But Fant's 18 career touchdown receptions are the best in school history for a tight end and the third-most in that category in Big Ten history.\n\nFant is also considered a possible early-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft, should he choose to leave school early. Iowa rarely has such talent at a skill position, which only makes it more confusing as to why the Hawkeyes haven't found more creative ways to throw the ball Fant's way. Ferentz dismissed the notion that something is going on with Fant away from the field.\n\n\"I can assure you, that's not an issue. Noah is a high-character guy,\" Ferentz said. \"He's been tremendous with us. He's a great kid. So there's no issues there at all, and that's hardly the deal. Beyond that, again, he's a good player.\"\n\nIowa is a 16-point favorite against an Illinois team allowing nearly 40 points a game. But the Black Friday finale against Nebraska could end up being a referendum on the Hawkeyes' season.\n\n\"It really goes down to two things for a football team or anybody when you face disappointment. You're either going to pull together or you're going to divide or you're going to fight and compete or you're going to surrender,\" Ferentz said. \"The choice is to push forward and maximize the opportunities moving forward, and I'm confident and comfortable our team will do that.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre carried a framed picture under his arm as he entered the room.\n\nHis art work: A buffalo walking into a storm.\n\nHis message: That's the way his team feels at the moment. The Buffaloes have dropped five straight after a 5-0 start. They've been besieged by injuries. And now there's a swirling report that MacIntyre's job is in question at the end of the season.\n\n\"There's a little bit of storm here the last few weeks and we've lost some close games,\" MacIntyre said Tuesday as he displayed the picture that usually adorns his office wall. \"We talked to them about life and what that means and walking into (the storm) together. They understood.\"\n\nA month ago, the Buffaloes (5-5, 2-5 Pac-12) were rolling toward a certain bowl bid.

But you have to win games.\"\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, athletic director Rick George issued a statement about speculation over MacIntyre's tenure with the team.\n\n\"We do not comment on speculation or unsubstantiated rumors with anonymous sources,\" George said. \"Let me just say I have made no decisions regarding the future of our football program.\"\n\nMacIntyre said he met with George two weeks ago and was given a vote of confidence.\n\n\"He gave me 100 percent support,\" MacIntyre said. \"I've seen him multiple times since then, never said a word to me about anything to this effect.

That's the only thing we're worried about.\"\n\nThe banged-up Buffaloes will be without a handful of starters, including safety Evan Worthington and cornerback Delrick Abrams. MacIntyre pointed out their injury epidemic has been an issue all season, even costing Shenault a few games.\n\n\"Let's face it: Look at the Cleveland Cavaliers without LeBron James. Players matter,\" MacIntyre said. \"But we had a lot of kids that have played now and played well. Hopefully, we'll have a different result Saturday.\"\n\nMacIntyre has gone 30-43 since being hired in December 2012 to turn around a lackluster Colorado program. He led the Buffaloes to the Pac-12 South title in 2016 and was named The Associated Press coach of the year.\n\nThey fell to 5-7 last season.\n\nAfter jumping out to a solid start this season, even appearing in the rankings, the Buffaloes have lost five in a row.

I've gotten so many emails today and so many texts about how proud they are of what we do.\"\n\nDespite the recent skid, MacIntyre's team remains focused. Quarterback Steven Montez said Tuesday's practice has been the \"best energy we've had all season. The guys' went out there and they had a chip on their shoulder.\"\n\nThey're ignoring all the outside noise.\n\n\"This is great to teach life lessons to young people,\" MacIntyre said. \"They're going to face a lot of hard times in life, too. Hopefully this is a little microcosm of that. Hopefully, we come out on the other side of it in good shape.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bill Nelson's campaign has filed a federal lawsuit to extend the unevenly conducted statewide recount of his re-election race against GOP Gov. Rick Scott, who holds a narrow lead over the three-term Democrat.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to give elections officials in each of Florida's 67 counties adequate time to finish \"a legally mandated and accurate recount,\" according to the senator's campaign.

In addition, Friday is the deadline for military and other overseas ballots to be counted.\n\nNelson's lawsuit is one of several that have been filed by different parties over various aspects of the recount.\n\nOther suits challenge the use of signatures to verify voter eligibility; Scott's role as the overseer of the state election process (the commission that certifies the results comprises the governor and two members of his Cabinet); and a provision prohibiting elections officials from counting a ballot received after Election Day if it was mailed from within the state but not if it came from a Florida citizen living in another country.\n\nRepublicans are claiming fraud in the recount process, particularly in Democrat-rich Broward and Palm Beach counties. Democrats, meanwhile, are making accusations of voter disenfranchisement.\n\nGOP Attorney General Pam Bondi is demanding the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigate claims that Broward\u2019s Democratic election supervisor allowed ineligible ballots to be counted, blocked Republican lawyers from legally observing the vote-counting process and withheld absentee ballots from voters.\n\nDemocrats have accused Scott and others of trying to prevent legitimate ballots from being counted.

The NFL has moved the Los Angeles Rams' Monday night showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs from Mexico City to Los Angeles due to the poor condition of the field at Azteca Stadium. (AP Photo/Christian Palma) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The NFL moved the Rams' Monday night showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs from Mexico City to Los Angeles on Tuesday due to the poor condition of the field at Azteca Stadium.\n\nThe league announced the extraordinary decision six days before one of the most-anticipated regular-season games of the year.\n\nIn a news release, the league said it determined that the recently re-sodded field at Mexico City's historic stadium \"does not meet NFL standards for playability and consistency, and will not meet those standards by next Monday.\"\n\nThe Rams (9-1) will host the Chiefs (9-1) at the Coliseum instead. The much-anticipated game is just the fifth meeting since 1970 between teams with one or fewer losses in Week 11 or later.\n\nThe decision creates a morass of logistical concerns for the teams and fans traveling to Mexico, and it disappoints thousands of Mexican fans eager to see a marquee matchup in North America's most populous city. But the league consulted with the players' association and local officials before deciding it couldn't risk the players' health on a damaged field.\n\n\"The combination of a difficult rainy season and a heavy multi-event calendar of events at the stadium have resulted in significant damage to the field that presents unnecessary risks to player safety and makes it unsuitable to host an NFL game,\" said Mark Waller, the NFL's executive vice president of international. \"As a result, we have determined that moving the game is the right decision, and one that we needed to announce now in order to allow our teams and fans to make alternate arrangements.\"\n\nAzteca officials changed the playing surface from natural grass to a hybrid in May, but the turf hasn't been ideal for several months. Concern about the field grew in recent days when aerial photos of the stadium showed serious damage to the grass, particularly on the end of the stadium recently used for a major concert.\n\nCruz Azul, the Liga MX soccer club that shares the stadium with Club America, played a tournament game on the field last Saturday in noticeably poor conditions. Coach Pedro Caixinha expressed concern, and the NFL continued working with groundskeepers to improve the field.\n\n\"The long and unusual rain season, as well as the calendar of events with third parties in Estadio Azteca, might be a factor for the grass to be far from optimal conditions,\" Azteca Stadium authorities said in a press release.\n\nThe Rams are required to keep the Coliseum available as a backup in case of a problem with international games. They immediately announced plans for ticket sales starting Wednesday, with season ticket holders allowed to buy their own seats and up to four more.\n\nThe Rams also will give away thousands of seats to first responders and people affected by recent tragedies in Southern California. Deadly wildfires have ravaged several areas near the Rams' training complex in Thousand Oaks for the past week, and 12 people were killed in a mass shooting in Thousand Oaks last Wednesday night.\n\nThe move also creates big logistical obstacles for \"Monday Night Football\" broadcaster ESPN, which will have to shift its operations back to the West Coast.\n\n\"We have been in communication with the NFL and we understand the league's decision,\" the network said in a statement. \"We are already in the process of adjusting our plans and will be ready to present this much-anticipated matchup on Monday Night Football from Los Angeles. We also remain committed to identifying future opportunities with the league to engage its already strong fan base in Mexico.\"\n\nAzteca hosted the first regular-season game ever held outside the U.S. in 2005 when Arizona beat San Francisco. The stadium has hosted several NFL exhibitions, and the Oakland Raiders, Houston Texans and New England Patriots all played regular-season games there over the past two years.\n\nThe Rams played in England in each of the previous two seasons, and they are expected to have another international game next season, as required of teams playing in a temporary home stadium.\n\nBoth the Rams and the Chiefs were due to play in Mexico for the first time next week. Kansas City has played just one regular-season game outside the U.S., going to London in 2015.\n\nThe Rams are in the third of four seasons at the Coliseum before their new multi-billion-dollar stadium complex in Inglewood opens in 2020. The venerable Coliseum hasn't hosted a \"Monday Night Football\" game since October 1985, and the Rams haven't hosted a game there on a Monday night since 1979, before they moved to Anaheim and then St. Louis.\n\nThe Rams traveled to Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Monday to spend their week of practice in high altitudes to prepare for Mexico City's conditions \u2014 and they plan to stay put anyway.\n\nSeveral players and coaches are still displaced from their homes near their training complex in Thousand Oaks by evacuations due to fire danger, and the Rams already transported the families and friends of many players and employees to Colorado Springs. The Rams currently plan to fly home on the weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Dufner says winning on the PGA Tour is so hard that anyone winning 2 percent of their events in a long career can be considered for the Hall of Fame. (AP Photo/Jon Super, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Jason Dufner scanned down both sides of the crowded practice range Tuesday at Sea Island as he tried to find a spot to practice.\n\nSo many players, even if he doesn't know all their names.\n\nAnd so few trophies.\n\nIt was another reminder to Dufner that golf has a failure rate unlike most other sports.\n\nThe PGA Tour had 648 players tee it up in at least one tournament last year, and only 37 players went home with a trophy. Consider the winners-only start to the calendar year at Kapalua. From the 34-man field in January, 25 players have not made it back.\n\nIt doesn't take an economics degree from Auburn to figure out that winning isn't easy.\n\nDufner, who has such a degree, came up with his own version of success on the PGA Tour that at first glance seems outrageous.\n\n\"You win 2 percent of your tournaments, you probably have a Hall of Fame career,\" Dufner said. \"You throw in a major and win 2 percent of your tournaments, and you're certainly in the Hall of Fame.\"\n\nMaybe he had Fred Couples or Mark O'Meara in mind.\n\nCouples won 2.4 percent of his career starts on the PGA Tour, along with the 1992 Masters. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame five years ago. O'Meara won 2.4 percent of his PGA Tour events, plus two majors in 1998. He was inducted two years later. Another example is Davis Love III, who has won 2.6 percent of his tournaments with one major and was inducted last year.\n\nHall of Fame standards are hard to determine now because a 16-person panel of mostly golf administrators talk among themselves before voting who should get in. But the standard isn't what it once was, nor should it be with a talent pool that is getting deeper with every year.\n\nIt's getting harder to win.\n\nThat didn't stop nine players from winning at least twice last season on the PGA Tour \u2014 Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Justin Thomas and Bryson DeChambeau each won three times \u2014 but in Dufner's eyes, those are either exceptional players or exceptional years, sometimes both.\n\nDufner won twice in one season in 2012, the year before he won the PGA Championship. He now has five victories in 314 starts. That equates to winning 1.6 percent of his PGA Tour starts with one major. So the Hall of Fame is not in the picture.\n\n\"I better get going,\" Dufner said with a laugh.\n\nOne measure of difficulty is who didn't win this year, a list that includes Jordan Spieth, Hideki Matsuyama and Henrik Stenson, who all started the year among the top 10 players in the world.\n\nAnother measure is who ended long droughts.\n\nThe most famous is Tiger Woods, an exception in many cases. His victory at the Tour Championship was his first since 2013, and it followed four surgeries on his back. Phil Mickelson in Mexico City won for the first time since 2013. Matt Kuchar won last week at Mayakoba, his first on the PGA Tour since 2014. Keegan Bradley, whose two victories as a rookie included the PGA Championship, won the BMW Championship for his first PGA Tour title since 2012.\n\nFormer U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson crushed the field at The Players Championship for his first victory since 2013.\n\nThe key ingredient in Dufner's model, of course, is playing long enough so that winning 2 percent of tournaments actually means something. And those who last that long usually build up scar tissue from all the times they failed to win.\n\nLosing happens a lot.\n\nJustin Rose and Johnson are among those who have made winning a habit. Johnson has won every calendar year since 2008 on the PGA Tour except for 2014. Rose has won every year since 2010 except for 2016, though he won Olympic gold in Rio de Janiero that summer.\n\n\"Winning every year is extremely tough to do,\" Dufner said. \"It's just a fine line out here.\"\n\nHow fine?\n\nDufner has a model for that, too.\n\n\"You have to have a 95 percent-plus success rate to win,\" he said.\n\nHe defines success on a hole-by-hole basis in a negative sense. It's more about what a player doesn't do wrong as opposed to what he did right. Last week in Mayakoba, he said he had five penalty drops and three-putted three times. That's not success. Dufner shot 13-under 271 and finished nine shots behind Kuchar.\n\n\"I probably had 15 or 20 shots that were not successful,\" he said, estimating his success rate at 90 percent.\n\nFor the 309th time in 314 starts on the PGA Tour, he failed to win.\n\nThen again, Dufner went over $26 million in career earnings. Failure is relative.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.", "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.

Iowa State didn't even bother to appeal Montgomery's suspension, instead chalking it up to a lesson learned and a chance for his backups to respond.\n\nThe Cyclones own the head-to-head tiebreaker over No. 7 West Virginia. But they need to win out and hope for a Mountaineers loss to make it to the championship game for the first time.\n\n\"We're really fortunate to have a really talented backfield,\" Iowa State coach Matt Campbell said. \"All those guys bring a lot of different qualities to the table.\"\n\nMontgomery's numbers \u2014 765 yards and six touchdowns on 4.5 yards a carry \u2014 at times belie his ability, as the third-year back often runs behind a line that has struggled to spring him. But Montgomery is undoubtedly a difference maker, and the kind of player who could easily leave for the NFL draft next spring.\n\nThe Cyclones' next-best running threat is freshman quarterback Brock Purdy. But trying to spring Purdy to run wild in open space might be too risky \u2014 especially against a physical defense like Texas.\n\nThe better bet is that the Cyclones will try to cobble together a first-half rushing attack behind reserves Kene Nwangwu, Johnnie Lang and Sheldon Croney. Those three have combined for just 3.1 yards a carry in 69 tries this year, but they say they're confident they can fill Montgomery's shoes.\n\nNwangwu is averaging 33 yards on kick returns, and he had 10 carries for 49 yards in a win over Oklahoma State on Oct. 6. Lang, a freshman, is one of the fastest players on the team, and Croney appears to be an option in short-yardage situations.\n\n\"I feel like whoever is in the game is just going to produce,\" Nwangwu said.\n\nCampbell said he is not concerned about missing Montgomery for a half, partly because the Cyclones played without him against the Cowboys and scored 48 points.\n\n\"We've been here already. We had to play a conference game, on the road, without our tailback,\" Campbell said. \"I'm excited for them. I think it's just another great opportunity for them to showcase that (group).\"\n\nMontgomery's suspension couldn't have come at a worse time for the Cyclones, who have won five straight in the league for the first time.\n\nBut Iowa State has shown an impressive knack for overcoming adversity, bouncing back from a 1-3 start despite losing two starting quarterbacks \u2014 Kyle Kempt to injury and Zeb Noland to a transfer \u2014 already this season.\n\n\"The cliche answer is the going to be this \u2014 but it's also the real answer,\" Campbell said his team's resilience. \"Our culture, within our walls ... the player leadership, the player ownership.

(Photo: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAt this stage of the season, most fantasy owners are far more likely to improve their rosters by making trades than by sifting through the waiver wire. Nevertheless, there still might be an opportunity to build some depth for the stretch run ... or prepare for the playoffs.\n\nRecommended bids based on a free agent acquisition budget (FAAB) of $100 for the season.\n\nBEST BETS\n\nRB Rashaad Penny, Seattle Seahawks ($10). As a first-round pick, Penny was probably on someone's roster to start the season. But his lack of production and his plunge down the depth chart likely got him cut. In Week 10, Chris Carson's injury opened up playing time -- and Penny cashed in. He ran for 108 yards on 12 carries, and will have a solid share of the backfield rotation this week even if Carson returns.\n\nWR Anthony Miller, Chicago Bears ($8). Another late-blooming rookie, Miller caught five passes for a season-high 122 yards and a touchdown against an admittedly depleted Detroit Lions secondary. The Bears offense has been clicking lately, but they'll face a tough challenge this week from the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nWR Josh Reynolds, Los Angeles Rams ($6). The Rams were dealt a crushing blow Sunday when Cooper Kupp suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Reynolds had a two-TD game in Week 8 when Kupp was out, so he could thrive once again as the team's No. 3 wideout.\n\nREPLACEMENTS\n\nWR Zay Jones, Buffalo Bills ($4). Jones is coming off his best game of the season, catching eight passes from new quarterback Matt Barkley for 93 yards and a touchdown. However, the Bills are on bye this week and they don't know if Barkley or Josh Allen will start in Week 12.\n\nRB Giovani Bernard, Cincinnati Bengals ($4). Recovered from a knee injury and playing for the first time since Week 4, Bernard served as a change-of-pace back behind starter Joe Mixon. He had only two rushes and two receptions, but he could gain a larger share going forward if there are no issues with the knee.\n\nSPECULATIVE PICKUPS\n\nQB Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens. Starter Joe Flacco is battling a hip injury and coach John Harbaugh says he could still play on Sunday, even if he doesn't log any practice time during the week. If Flacco is out, however, Jackson becomes an interesting addition because of his strong arm and his outstanding running ability. But beware: Robert Griffin III could also be in the mix to start.\n\nWR Brandon Marshall, New Orleans Saints. Sadly, the Dez Bryant era in New Orleans lasted all of two days before he tore his Achilles tendon. The role of veteran receiver now falls to Marshall, who just signed this week. It'll be difficult for him to contribute quickly.\n\nRBs Malcolm Brown, Los Angeles Rams and Spencer Ware, Kansas City Chiefs. These two represent a class of understudies who could get a chance to take over the main roles on their teams if an unexpected injury occurs.

USA TODAY Sports' Jarrett Bell explains why each one could pay off. USA TODAY Sports\n\nLe'Veon Bell has surpassed 1,200 rushing yards three times in five seasons. (Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLe'Veon Bell will not be wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers uniform in 2018 \u2014 and may never do so again \u2014 after failing to report to the club and sign his franchise tag by Tuesday afternoon's 4 p.m. ET deadline.\n\nWhat colors will Bell don in 2019, assuming he opts to play at all?\n\nBased on what we know right now \u2014 and coaching staffs, roster compositions and salary cap structures are all very fluid \u2014 here are 10 teams that seem most likely to attempt enlisting Bell's services:\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nA dark horse? Probably, especially since they're not awash in cap space. But consider:\n\n\u25ba Speed back Tevin Coleman is ticketed for free agency.\n\n\u25ba Devonta Freeman has struggled to stay healthy, and his physical running style definitely casts doubt on his ability to be a workhorse.\n\n\u25ba Bell would surely love the opportunities this offense might present, both in leveraging his versatility and allowing him to take advantage of mismatches created by Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley.\n\n\u25ba We hear the Atlanta hip-hop scene might be ideal for an aspiring rap star.\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nOff the top, this would provide Bell with two cracks at the Steelers every year. In terms of need, current Baltimore backs Javorius Allen and Ty Montgomery have expiring deals, and Alex Collins will be a restricted free agent \u2014 and he hasn't proven ready to be the long-term solution. Finally, imagine Bell's career had he played alongside Michael Vick. Now imagine him in the same backfield with Lamar Jackson. Frightening potential.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nFrom a personal perspective, a small Wisconsin town might be a non-starter for Bell. From a professional perspective, he'll walk into the Hall of Fame and stand a chance of picking up a few rings if he's paired with Aaron Rodgers for four or five years.\n\nHouston Texans\n\nA lot of NFL players want to play with Deshaun Watson, and this offense could use a more consistently explosive backfield element than Lamar Miller \u2014 he's under contract through 2019 \u2014 has supplied. And with receivers DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller working downfield, Bell wouldn't miss Antonio Brown.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nAndrew Luck has shown he remains an elite quarterback. Frank Reich appears to have high-level potential as a coach. Whatever. No other team can offer Bell more money in 2019 than Indy, projected to have nearly $125 million in cap space.\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\nThey're not that good and could certainly use a weapon of Bell's caliber. And Adam Gase has a very potent offensive mind. But, again, Whatever. This option allows Bell to live in South Florida, which he clearly adores, year-round.\n\nNew York Jets\n\nUp-and-coming franchise quarterback (allegedly). A sense of swagger thanks to young players like Jamal Adams. And only the Colts will likely have more cap resources than the Jets in 2019. But New York definitely has a lot more to offer someone who's more than dabbling in the entertainment business than Indianapolis would.\n\nOakland Raiders\n\nYou get to play for Jon Gruden, if that appeals to you \u2014 and Bell would surely be of more interest to the coach than aging players like Marshawn Lynch and Doug Martin. You get to be part of a proud organization that could be poised for a quick resurrection depending on how Gruden uses his bevy of first-round picks and scads of cap space. Oh, and two other words: Las Vegas.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\n\nAnother club awash in cap space and seemingly employing gifted protagonists at the two most important spots: head coach (Kyle Shanahan) and quarterback (Jimmy Garoppolo). And maybe Bell might even view traditional third-down back Jerick McKinnon, who's coming back from a torn ACL, as someone who can help extend his career rather than be a threat to his touches.\n\nAnd finally ...\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nReally? It seems to remain a remote possibility, especially if the Steelers put the transition tag on Bell and match an outside offer that might keep him in black and gold his entire career. I'm far from convinced Bell and James Conner could easily coexist in a manner similar to Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram. But given time to blend their skills, it could work \u2014 perhaps beautifully if Conner is taking the bulk of the carries and Bell spends more time lining up in the slot.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "FILE - In this Tuesday, Feb. 6, 2018 file photo, Boston Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask (40) plays against the Detroit Red Wings in the second period of an NHL hockey game in Detroit.

(Photo: Charles LeClaire, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAt least one element of the Le'Veon Bell saga has been resolved: The all-pro running back won't be back in action until at least 2019.\n\nBell opted not to sign his franchise tender with the Pittsburgh Steelers by Tuesday's 4 p.m. ET deadline, general manager Kevin Colbert confirmed, making him ineligible to play for the rest of this season.\n\nBell, 26, had remained away from the organization since receiving the franchise tag for the second consecutive year in March. Had he signed, he would have been able to play for a pro-rated amount of the original $14.54 million price (approximately $6 million).\n\nThe decision not to sign very well could mark the end of Bell's acrimonious run with the Steelers. Pittsburgh could choose to use the franchise tag for a third consecutive year in 2019, but the expected cost of more than $25 million would almost certainly prove prohibitive.\n\nThe team could alternatively use the transition tag, but it would not receive compensation (beyond a league-issued compensatory pick) if it chooses not to match an offer sheet from another team for the long-term contract Bell has sought.\n\nA three-time Pro Bowl selection, Bell ranked second in the NFL in total yards from scrimmage (1,946) in 2017 while leading the league in touches (406).\n\nIn Bell's absence, the Steelers have a 6-2-1 record that places them atop the AFC North. Pittsburgh's offense ranks fourth both in yards per game (419.9) and scoring (31 points per game).

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMIAMI (AP) \u2014 The Miami Heat sent a letter to Miami-Dade County commissioners Tuesday, saying they want to set the record straight on what the team perceives as misconceptions about the relationship between it and the county as a new naming-rights deal looms.\n\nThe letter from Heat Business Operations President Eric Woolworth comes about three weeks after county officials exercised their right to take full control of negotiations for the next naming-rights deal for the arena where the team plays. The county chose an option to pay the Heat $2 million annually starting in 2020 and keep the rest.\n\nThe Heat hoped for a collaborative effort on the next naming-rights deal, saying both sides would benefit. County officials did not make that offer.\n\n\"I tend to take for granted that everyone in South Florida knows how the Arena came to be, what its purpose is, how we operate it, what kind of partners we have been for the County, and what we have come to mean in the community,\" Woolworth wrote. \"I see now that this is a flawed approach.\"\n\nThe current naming-rights deal with American Airlines Arena, which has been worth about $2.1 million annually, ends in 2019. The relationship between the Heat and the county is complex; the team paid the construction costs for the arena, but the facility is owned by the county, and some lawmakers have bristled over the years about how they believe the arrangement is too team-friendly. The Heat say that notion is unfounded.\n\nIt's unclear what advantage \u2014 if any \u2014 the next holder of the naming rights could glean from the Heat brand if the team is not part of the deal-making process. The team controls the arena operations.\n\nAnd that brand is bustling. The Heat sold 35,000 of their popular \"Vice\" edition jerseys last season, more of what the league calls City Edition jerseys than all other 29 NBA teams did combined and are on pace to sell significantly more this season. Those jerseys say Miami across the front, not Heat, and the team contends that selling them in 49 different countries makes the jerseys a walking billboard of sorts for a city that thrives on tourism.\n\nCounty Mayor Carlos Gimenez told commissioners that it's believed Miami-Dade could generate up to $50 million in additional revenue over the lifetime of the deal by taking over control of the naming rights.\n\nWoolworth wrote that Heat managing general partner Micky Arison and his family have never taken a cent out of the arena or the team \u2014 \"they are the kind of owners every community and every fan base wants,\" Woolworth said \u2014 and pointed out that the team has spent nearly $94 million to maintain the arena, well over the $18 million that the county mandated be spent to this point in the lease agreement.\n\n\"Think about that,\" Woolworth wrote. \"We take our responsibility to maintain the Arena you own in a first-class manner so seriously that we have spent $75 million more than we have been required in order to do so.\"\n\nThere's also a risk to the county because regardless of what it sells the naming rights for, or if the deal is delayed, it must pay the Heat $2 million per year regardless. And all this comes with the county's widely criticized deal that gave the Miami Marlins an extremely team-friendly stadium deal still fresh in the minds of many lawmakers. The Heat believe any comparison to the Marlins' situation is a false equivalency.\n\n\"We have tried to make the County proud to be partners with us,\" Woolworth wrote.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Metafora Production via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 A senior Republican senator said Tuesday he is convinced that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman directed Jamal Khashoggi's murder, even as a top Trump administration official downplayed the Saudi ruler's role in the journalist's death.\n\n\"The intel that I\u2019m aware of points to MBS,\" Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said of Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler who is known by his initials.\n\n\"There\u2019s no smoking gun, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that he directed it, knew it,\" Corker said. \"And we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to cause (the Saudis) to pay a price.\"\n\nCorker's comments came hours after President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, told reporters that an audio recording related to Khashoggi's murder does not implicate Bin Salman.\n\n\"That is not the conclusion that the people who have heard it have come to,\" Bolton told reporters during a press briefing in Singapore.\n\nBolton said he had not listened to the audio himself.\n\nCorker said the Trump administration must give Congress a high-level briefing on the investigation into Khashoggi's death, as well as into America's role in supporting a Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. The war in Yemen has claimed thousands of civilian lives and put millions of Yemenis on the brink of starvation. U.S. support for the Saudi campaign has become increasingly controversial in the wake of Khashoggi's death and a growing humanitarian crisis there.\n\n\"I see tremendous negative feelings (in Congress) toward Saudi Arabia right now,\" Corker said.\n\nSeveral other lawmakers are pushing for dramatic action against Saudi Arabia, including ceasing all arms sales to the kingdom and defunding the U.S. war effort in Yemen. Corker suggested those proposals could pass in the current climate, particularly if Trump was not forthcoming.\n\nCorker said the Trump administration could take the steam out of a sharp legislative response if officials made a \"full-throated presentation\" to lawmakers in the coming days. He said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis should come to Capitol Hill and deliver a closed-door briefing.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday night that one of Khashoggi's killers could be heard in the recording saying \u201ctell your boss.\" The Times cited three anonymous sources and suggested the \"boss\" was believed to be the crown prince.\n\nThe Times story says, however, that the crown prince was not mentioned by name.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert declined to comment on Bolton's assessment of the audio. At a briefing Tuesday, Nauert said Pompeo has not listened to the recording either, and she suggested it would be \"inappropriate\" for him to do so. Pompeo previously served as Trump's CIA director.\n\n\"The secretary is in the role of being the nation\u2019s chief diplomat and it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate\" to listen to the tape.

In the seven weeks since Khashoggi's disappearance, Trump and Pompeo have emphasized the long-standing U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia and the regime's role in helping the U.S. counter Iran in the Middle East.\n\nTrump has said the U.S. should not cancel arms sales to Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi's death, and he has said Congress should take the lead on drafting a response to the Washington Post columnist's death.\n\nKhashoggi went missing Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi diplomatic compound for routine paperwork needed to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz. Cengiz, a Turkish national, waited for her fianc\u00e9 outside the compound. He never returned.\n\nThe Saudi government initially said Khashoggi left their consulate unharmed on Oct. 2. Amid mounting international outrage, the kingdom then asserted that Khashoggi died after a \"brawl\" escalated inside the Saudi diplomatic facility. They later called his death a \u201cpremeditated murder.\u201d\n\nThe whereabouts of Khashoggi\u2019s body and remains are unknown.

AP\n\nThe mystery behind the polio-like disease sprouting up across the U.S. (Photo: CDC)\n\nThe number of cases of a rare but paralyzing illness continues to climb as parents of afflicted children urge federal health officials to more quickly identify a cause and possible treatments.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday raised the number of cases of acute flaccid myelitis reported this year to 90, spread among 27 states. An additional 162 patients are under investigation.\n\nThe disease is rare: It afflicts fewer than one in a million children. But symptoms are life-altering. It can paralyze a child's arms and legs. Some need ventilators to breathe. It can also cause muscle weakness, slurred speech and difficulty moving eyes and swallowing.\n\nCDC officials are still working to identify what causes AFM.\n\nAlthough a strain of a respiratory virus called enterovirus that circulates in late summer and fall was the prime suspect when the CDC began tracking the disease in 2014,federal health officials say they don't have enough evidence to conclude that particular virus is responsible for AFM.\n\nMore: Scientists are searching for answers to AFM, the illness causing polio-like paralysis in children\n\nMore: What parents should know about the polio-like paralyzing disease the CDC is warning about\n\nMore: Paralyzing polio-like disease affects more children, Maryland Health Department says\n\nNancy Messonnier, the CDC's director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said patients with AFM typically had a fever or respiratory illness three to 10 days before they developed weakness in the arms or legs.\n\nIn addition to investigating enterovirus as a possible cause, CDC is searching whether the body's immune response to a virus causes the disease.\n\nMessonnier noted that respiratory viruses are common this time of year, but a small number of children have developed AFM.\n\n\"What we don\u2019t know is what's triggering AFM,\" Messonnier said. \"It may be one of the viruses we have already tested. It may be a virus we haven\u2019t yet detected. Or it could be the virus is kicking off another process and it is actually triggering (AFM) through an autoimmune process.\"\n\nThe illness peaks every other year from late summer through early fall. Public health officials began tracking it in 2014. They identified 120 cases in 34 states.\n\nThe number fell to 22 cases in 2015, but surged again in 2016, with 149 cases in 39 states.\n\nSo far in 2018, Messonnier said the number of cases confirmed and under investigation are similar to patterns that emerged in 2014 and 2016. Most cases confirmed in 2018 were children.\n\nAlthough there have been no reported deaths in 2018, Messonnier acknowledged that the CDC has not continued to track patients diagnosed in past years. The agency has asked state health departments to match confirmed AFM cases against death registries since 2014 to check whether any kids or adults have died.\n\nDoctors tested the respiratory and fecal specimens of patients diagnosed with AFM this year. About half of those patients had either enterovirus or another common cold virus, called rhinovirus.\n\nDoctors believe that spinal fluid is a more definitive measure of whether a virus causes a disease. An adult on immune system drugs and a child who rapidly became paralyzed with AFM were the only two people whose spinal fluid tested positive for enterovirus.\n\nIn other cases, Messonnier said, it's possible the virus had already cleared the body's spinal cord, or might have hidden in harder-to-test tissue.\n\n\"It is possible we are missing the pathogen because we are testing at the point of limb weakness, not at the point where the illness occurs,\" Messonnier said.\n\nWith widespread attention on this illness, the CDC said it has evaluated more reports of children with AFM-type symptoms over the past three months.\n\nThe CDC has sought to raise awareness among doctors who are encouraged to report possible cases to local health departments. That likely means more doctors are reporting possible cases, and more families are asking about symptoms.\n\nThe federal agency said it has worked with local and state health departments and hospitals to gather information and confirm suspected cases more quickly.\n\nWhile investigators attempt to pinpoint a cause of the illness, CDC officials said it's important to take precautionary measures such as getting recommended vaccines, washing your hands and avoiding mosquito bites.\n\nParents of children afflicted with AFM have grown frustrated with the speed of identifying a cause of the disease. In social media posts and interviews, parents have urged the CDC and local health departments to aggressively investigate the cause of the illness.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2018/11/13/acute-flaccid-myelitis-afm-polio-like-illness-paralysis-children-cdc/1980973002/", "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Boston Red Sox knuckleballer Steven Wright has had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee for an injury that kept him out of the World Series.\n\nThe team says Dr. Riley Williams operated Monday at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.

(AP Photo/Paul White) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 Real Madrid is done searching for a new coach.\n\nThe club said Tuesday it is sticking with Santiago Solari, giving him a permanent contract until June 2021.\n\nSolari was appointed as the interim coach about two weeks ago to replace the fired Julen Lopetegui and was rewarded with a long-term deal after leading the team to four straight victories, putting it back on track in the Spanish league and the Champions League.\n\nThe 42-year-old Solari is a former Argentina international who played for Real Madrid in the early 2000s. He had previously coached Madrid's \"B'' team.\n\nThere had been speculation about Antonio Conte and Roberto Martinez as possible replacements for Lopetegui, but Solari gained the club's confidence \u2014 and the approval of fans and players \u2014 with his impressive start in charge of the main squad.\n\nMadrid outscored its opponents 15-2 in the four matches under Solari. It had lost five of its last seven games with Lopetegui in command, being outscored 13-4.\n\nSolari was virtually unknown outside of Spain and few saw him as a front-runner for the Madrid job, but he has always been well-regarded within the club.\n\nHe got the demanding Madrid fans on his side by making some popular choices early in his stint, including giving more playing time to Vinicius Junior, the young Brazilian who arrived amid high expectations but had been relegated to the \"B'' team under Lopetegui. The 18-year-old forward played well every time Solari put him in, showing he was indeed ready to be with the main squad.\n\nPlayers who had been struggling under Lopetegui also began thriving after Solari took over. Karim Benzema was one of them, scoring four goals in the four victories under Solari. The French striker had scored only once in the last 10 matches before Lopetegui was fired.\n\nThe club had registered Solari as its permanent coach on Monday because local regulations prohibit teams from having an interim coach for more than two weeks.\n\nMadrid officials had been praising Solari but had not said they stopped looking for a full-time replacement for Lopetegui, the former Spain coach who was fired following a 5-1 loss to Barcelona at Camp Nou Stadium.\n\nThe club said the decision to keep Solari was made after a meeting of the board of directors on Tuesday.\n\nThe coach helped Madrid move from ninth to sixth in the Spanish league, four points behind Barcelona. He also put the three-time defending European champions back at the top of its group in the Champions League, tied on points with Roma.\n\nSolari helped Madrid win the 2002 Champions League as a player as was involved in the build-up that led to Zinedine Zidane's superb winner in the final.\n\nThe former midfielder also played for River Plate, Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan.\n\nHe had been coaching Real Madrid's \"B'' team since 2016, taking over not long after Zidane left to coach the main squad.\n\nMadrid's next match is at Eibar in the Spanish league on Nov. 24, after the international break.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

How do I presume when there\u2019s so much at stake?\u201d\n\nFrom here, as if in search of answers, \u201cDelta\u201d takes us through a varied landscape, leading eventually to a child\u2019s cry and one more question: \u201cDoes my love just make me feel good?\u201d Mystery persists but acceptance is suggested: Maybe the cycle of new life and simple pleasure is all it\u2019s really about.\n\nMore: The CMA Awards and 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald\" highlight the week in entertainment\n\nMore: The story behind Mumford & Sons' mini album\n\n\u201cI love that interpretation,\u201d says Winston Marshall, 30, whose banjo virtuosity has been a hallmark of the Mumfords\u2019 sound since their formation in 2007. \u201cEven though it\u2019s actually the first time I\u2019ve heard it. But, yeah, I think there is a coherence to the album.\u201d\n\nAs to what that coherence is, Marshall leaves that up to each listener to decide. In fact, each member of Mumford & Sons may have his own idea about what each song is about. Much of this has to do with their approach to writing, with much of the material deriving from the regular gatherings they call \u201cFriday Night Lads.\u201d These involve friends hanging out, playing music together, tossing ideas back and forth and injecting multiple perspectives into the songs as they form.\n\nMumford & Sons, left to right Ted Dwane, Marcus Mumford, Winston Marshall, Ben Lovett.

Whenever we feel like it\u2019s right to use a banjo, let\u2019s use it. But let\u2019s use it in a way that\u2019s unusual. Let\u2019s layer it up and use it eight times over. Or let\u2019s not start things with an acoustic guitar, which is what we did in the early days. Let\u2019s do a proper EDM/hip-hop process, chopping up beats in the computer and then putting it in ProTools to use with samples. After all, we\u2019ve got very wide-ranging tastes, from Jay-Z to Bob Dylan, so we shouldn\u2019t have to limit ourselves in our creativity.\u201d\n\nMumford, Marshall, bassist Ted Dwayne and keyboardist Ben Lovett devoted three years to writing new material, which is supplemented on \u201cDelta\u201d with songs they\u2019d composed six years ago but fit well with their current inclinations. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start with a theme in mind,\u201d Mumford notes. \u201cWe started with ourselves.\u201d\n\nMarshall agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s a searching quality to \u201cDelta\u201d because we were confronted by things we\u2019ve never had to deal with before these past three years. I\u2019ve had two kids. Ben got divorced. These raised existential questions for us all.\u201d\n\nThrough the churning electric guitar motif of the album\u2019s first single \u201cGuiding Light,\u201d the whispered wonder of \u201cWoman\u201d and the titanic crescendo and heavenly chorus that buoys the affirmation \u201cI have hope once more,\u201d \u201cDelta\u201d is this band\u2019s most ambitious effort and arguably its greatest achievement. It also argues convincingly for the album format in a singles-dominated era.\n\n\u201cAlbums let us do songs that you can\u2019t put out in the streaming world,\u201d Marshall insists. \u201cThat\u2019s important to us.

(AP) \u2014 During a harsh season in which the Maryland football team has been forced to deal with an array of setbacks \u2014 none worse than the death of player Jordan McNair \u2014 the Terrapins have repeatedly showed their resiliency.\n\nWith No. 9 Ohio State next on the schedule, Maryland has yet another obstacle to overcome. Interim coach Matt Canada announced Tuesday that starting quarterback Kasim Hill tore the ACL in his left knee during last week's game at Indiana, making this the second straight season he's had cut short by an ACL tear.\n\n\"It's very disappointing. Obviously, there are no words to say to make it any better,\" Canada said. \"Great kid, a kid who worked so hard to battle his way back. He will again.\"\n\nA year ago, Hill tore his right ACL in the third game of his freshman season. Now, he's got to deal with surgery and rehabilitation for a second time.\n\nHill posted on Instagram : \"Never thought I'd have to attack this process all over again, but the Lord has more adversity for me to overcome.\"\n\nHill started all 10 games this season. He threw for 1,083 yards and nine touchdowns with four interceptions.\n\nTyrrell Pigrome will start against the visiting Buckeyes (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten) on Saturday as the Terrapins (5-5, 3-4) try for a third straight week to get the victory that will make them bowl eligible.\n\nThat the Terps are even in contention for a berth in the postseason is impressive, given what they've gone through. Since McNair collapsed on the practice field in May and subsequently died of heatstroke, the football program has:\n\n\u2014 Seen coach DJ Durkin be put on administrative leave in August, reinstated on Oct. 30 and fired on Oct. 31;\n\n\u2014 Been the focus of external reviews into McNair's death and the culture of the program;\n\n\u2014 Parted ways with three athletic trainers ; and\n\n\u2014 Played the entire season under Canada, who also is serving as offensive coordinator.\n\nCanada deserves credit for keeping the team together, but he's had help from his staff and the players. The seniors on the team, who have played a huge role on the field and in the locker room, will be honored Saturday before their final home game.\n\n\"A lot of people wrote this football team off in August, (saying) 'Probably not going to win a game and the whole program is going to fall apart,'\" Canada said. \"The seniors didn't let that happen.\n\n\"I wish really bad we'd have won more games, and so do they. But how could you not say what a great job they've done? Because they've held it together.\"\n\nThe Terrapins have gone through so much this season that no one could blame them for being physically and mentally exhausted after losing Hill and faltering during last week's 34-32 defeat at Indiana.\n\nBut Canada doesn't see a letdown happening, not after the Terrapins have come this far.\n\n\"There's a lot more going on here with this football team than anybody understands, the way they lean on each other, the way they stick together,\" Canada said. \"So I don't have any doubt they're going to play very, very hard.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

This season, the Washington State football coach has covered topics like why he loves Colorado\u2019s mascot and the most devious trick-or-treating strategies.\n\nThis week, Leach dug into the question you didn\u2019t know you wanted the answer to: If there was an all-out brawl among the Pac-12 coaches, who would be the last one standing?\n\nI know we've all wondered it, but if there was an all out brawl among the Pac-12 football head coaches, who would be the last coach standing? Here's Mike Leach's take: pic.twitter.com/CBguAAbn8r \u2014 Femi Abebefe (@SWXFemi) November 13, 2018\n\nProps to Leach because he stood there at the podium and genuinely gave this question some thought \u2014 that, or he was trying to remember who his fellow Pac-12 coaches are. At first, he said Utah\u2019s Kyle Whittingham:\n\n\u201cBased on their players, Kyle would be. Those guys hit you as hard as anybody in the conference.\u201d\n\nBut then Leach really gave it some thought and started to consider who else he thinks is in good shape, which led him to Arizona State\u2019s Herm Edwards. As Leach explained:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care if they get ticked off because actually, privately, I think I would but we\u2019re going to be more modest than that. I\u2019m gonna say Kyle or Herm for sure. \u2026 They\u2019re both in shape. Simple, at this age if you\u2019re in shape, you\u2019ve got a chance. They\u2019re both in great shape. They\u2019re both in shape, they both exercise. \u201cAnd then pretty good and successful backgrounds as far as conditioning, all that. Both defensive guys or their defensive players play tough and physical. \u2026 Now if you could stay away from them, you\u2019d still be standing. I don\u2019t know, maybe one of the distance runner-looking guys.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, someone asked about Oregon coach Mario Cristobal, who definitely deserves consideration in this conversation. About the first-year Ducks coach, Leach said:\n\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t want to get tied up with him. You don\u2019t want to let him get his hands on you because he is big and he\u2019s got long levers. You don\u2019t want him to get those things on you. He would be dangerous, there\u2019s no question.

Trevon Grimes is African-American.\n\n\u201cThe Ohio State University unequivocally and vehemently disputes the unfounded allegations by Brett McMurphy,\u201d Ohio State president Michael Drake said in a statement. \u201cAny allegations of racism are outrageous and false. The university told McMurphy that we have found no evidence to support these allegations. Reporting in this manner is irresponsible, inflammatory and a severe invasion of privacy of a student athlete and his family as well as a baseless personal attack on Coach Meyer. It is regrettable that McMurphy and his employer would use such poor judgment in running this inaccurate story.\u201d\n\nMcMurphy stood by his report, which he told USA TODAY Sports had on-the-record interviews from LeBron Grimes, Trevon\u2019s father, and another friend of the family along with three unnamed teammates of Trevon Grimes at Florida who Trevon Grimes told about the incident. Trevon Grimes declined to answer McMurphy\u2019s questions.\n\nThe story included responses from Smith and Ohio State disputing what occurred in the altercation. Ohio State initially denied any incident took place, but later told McMurphy there was an \u201cinteraction\u201d between Smith and Grimes.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t my allegations,\u201d McMurphy said. \u201cThose are the allegations from the father of Trevon Grime, Dennis Allen (a longtime family friend of the Grimes\u2019) and the three Florida players. I quoted them and they all said Smith used the N-word. \u2026 This is not a story that relies on a list of anonymous sources.\u201d\n\nOhio State quarterback Tate Martell responded to the Murphy by calling it \"100% false\" on Twitter.\n\nTrevon Grimes was my best friend back then... and is still my best friend to this day.

(AP Photo/John Raoux) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Every player on South Carolina's team knows the reason the Gamecocks went 4-4 in the Southeastern Conference and are still trying to become bowl eligible in mid-November \u2014 they have struggled to maintain momentum for an entire game.\n\nThe latest example was last week's loss to Florida, in which the Gamecocks blew a 17-point lead in the final 16 minutes. There were slow starts against Kentucky, going down 24-3 after the Wildcats first four drivers and versus Texas A&M, trailing 16-0 at half, that created problems an excellent second half couldn't solve.\n\nThe inconsistency leaves a team thought to be the most likely challenger to Georgia in the SEC East locked into fourth in the division with three games to go \u2014 all against nonconference teams.\n\nThe Gamecocks play Football Championship Subdivision Chattanooga on Saturday, perhaps the best shot at getting that sixth win to go to a bowl with No. 2 Clemson looming at the end of the month and a Dec. 1 game with Akron to make up for a game canceled because of Hurricane Florence.\n\n\"If we go back and look at it, there are five or six plays where a better block here, or a throw or catch or whatever it may be \u2014 a little thing could have been the difference in the game,\" quarterback Jake Bentley said.\n\nChattanooga provides a relief from the grind of eight straight SEC games, only broken up by a bye week and an unexpected week off after the Sept. 15 game against Marshall was canceled by Hurricane Florence.\n\nSouth Carolina has only lost twice to FCS teams since 1990 \u2014 both times to The Citadel. Even with the 23-22 loss to the Bulldogs in 2015, the Gamecocks have averaged a 21-point win over their last dozen FCS opponents.\n\nThe Mocs will have their own motivation. At 6-4 and with their Southern Conference season over, they are likely on the outside of the 24-team FCS playoff bracket. But a win over South Carolina would be impossible for the playoff committee to ignore.\n\nAnd without a lot of pressure to win, Chattanooga defensive lineman Isaiah Mack said they can have fun.\n\n\"It's going to be a fun game. Just pin your ears back and let's go play some ball. Try to get an upset really,\" Mack said.\n\nFor South Carolina, a stunning loss to Chattanooga would turn an uneasy year closer to a disaster. After Will Muschamp took the 3-9 team he inherited to six wins in 2016 and nine victories in 2017, this season the Gamecocks rise seems to have stalled, barring a stunning win to break Clemson's four-game winning streak in the is-state rivalry.\n\nBut Muschamp said he thinks the inconsistency is temporary. Players usually listen better after a loss and he saw a lot of improvement at Tuesday's morning practice.\n\nThe Florida game was unusual for Muschamp's three years at South Carolina. It was only his sixth loss in 23 games decided by seven points or fewer.\n\n\"We've been really good in one score games. They understand those games are going to come down to probably three or four for five plays in the fourth quarter,\" Muschamp said. \"The interesting part of that is you never know when they are going to come. We've got to come out on top in those situations.\"\n\nBentley said the key for South Carolina this week is to quickly learn from the Florida mistakes, and not dwell on them, and ignore the huge in-state rivalry game at the end of the month.\n\n\"Not only can we not look ahead, we can't look behind,\" Bentley said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nAmazon has a retrograde culture that systematically undercuts women and keeps them at the margins. HQ2 is a chance for it to make a course correction.\n\nAmazon fulfillment center in Aurora, Colorado. (Photo: Rick T. Wilking/Getty Images)\n\nAmazon has just announced its HQ2 winners, and all the talk is about what this means for the anointed cities. But there is another opportunity here, one for Amazon itself to make fresh starts in Crystal City, Virginia, and Long Island City, New York. Right now, Amazon has a retrograde culture that systematically undercuts women and keeps them at the margins. These two new headquarters are a chance for the company to change its ways.\n\nAmazon is not the only powerful company with this problem, of course. Many of America\u2019s most influential corporations have recently come under fire for creating workplaces that feel more like frat houses, where men run the show and sexism runs rampant. But facing heightened scrutiny, some have acknowledged the problem and taken concrete steps to promote gender equality. But Amazon has taken a much different approach, instead creating a veneer of diversity and inclusivity while failing to take measures that would actually empower female employees.\n\nAmazon is a boys' club, despite diversity veneer\n\nAt Amazon, top leadership roles are overwhelmingly occupied by men, oppressive workplace policies create an environment that is hostile to female employees and civil employment lawsuits filed by women continue to grow in number. Lawmakers in the winning HQ2 city should demand that the company commit to clearly defined benchmarks of improvement.\n\nThe upper echelons of Amazon\u2019s workplace are a boys club, plain and simple. Of the 105 executives, senior officials and managers at Amazon, 82 are men \u2014 78 percent. This means that key decisions about the company\u2019s direction are made in boardrooms where women hardly have a seat at the table. In fact, in some of Amazon\u2019s leading divisions \u2014 AWS, Prime and Marketplace \u2014 there are 37 people that report in some capacity to CEO Jeff Bezos and only two of them are women.\n\nWhen it comes to first- and mid-level officials and managers, the gender breakdown is basically the same \u2014 only 23 percent are women. Administrative support roles are the only ones where women represent a majority at Amazon. Contrary to Amazon\u2019s lip service, the tech giant is a male dominant company through and through.\n\nMore: Flashback: The wooing of Amazon HQ2: Taxpayers, watch out for your wallets\n\nDonald Trump's Amazon-Washington Post-Jeff Bezos attacks are attacks on First Amendment\n\nIn Bernie Sanders vs. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, only workers lose\n\nA shareholder proposal last spring from the Service Employees International Union Pension Plans Master Trust and its investment adviser scolded the company for not walking the walk on inclusion: \u201cWhile Amazon\u2019s board articulates support for diversity among directors and executives, it has failed to translate that verbal support into practical action.\u201d\n\nEqual pay is another issue on which Amazon says one thing publicly and does the opposite privately. Amazon claims to pay men and women equally, but behind the scenes, the company received a \u201cC\u201d on the Gender Pay Scorecard put out by a leading investment firm and one of Amazon\u2019s own shareholders. The Gender Pay Scorecard explicitly docks Amazon for withholding information about the percentage of operations accounted for in its internal pay analysis. And this year, Amazon actively lobbied against a bill in Seattle that proposed expanded protections for employees who discuss their salaries with coworkers.\n\nThen there are Amazon\u2019s brutal workplace policies. From 2016 to 2017, civil employment lawsuits filed by women against Amazon doubled. In one particularly harrowing case, a woman with breast cancer was informed that she was placed on a \u201cperformance improvement plan\u201d because \u201cdifficulties\u201d in her \u201cpersonal life\u201d had interfered with her fulfilling work goals. Meanwhile, in 2017, Amazon\u2019s Audible division lost two executives in one day after an internal review found that some employees regarded the company as \u201cless of a safe space for women.\u201d\n\nAmazon is run by men who call the shots\n\nThe trend here is clear: Amazon\u2019s top brass \u2014 mostly men \u2014 call the shots and when women employees speak up or seek justice, they often get shut down.\n\nPerhaps this is not surprising given that Amazon pays its workers a median wage of roughly $29,000 per year. And certain leaders do deserve credit for speaking truth to power. But lawmakers across the country \u2014 who have forked over $1.5 billion in taxpayer subsidies to the third-richest company in the world \u2014 must actually do something. Those in New York City and Northern Virginia should lead the charge.\n\nThey must call on Amazon and its board to commit to clearly defined benchmarks of progress over the next five years. Amazon should also welcome an independent, transparent review of its employment practices.

The junior sharpshooter is a big reason why Marquette returned to the AP Top 25 this week. (AP Photo/AJ Mast, FIle) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Markus Howard is quite the big shot at No. 24 Marquette.\n\nHe can rebound. He can find open teammates. He can draw extra attention from defenses simply by just being on the floor.\n\nAnd when he gets going at the 3-point line, the Golden Eagles can be tough to beat.\n\nThe junior sharpshooter is a big reason why Marquette returned to the Top 25 this week. It is the school's first appearance in the poll since 2013, and the first time in Steve Wojciechowski's five-year tenure as head coach.\n\nHoward was 10 of 16 from the field, including 7 of 10 from 3-point range, for 37 points in 28 minutes in a 92-59 win over Bethune-Cookman on Saturday.\n\nThat outing erased the memory of a subpar season opener, when Howard was 5 of 16 from the field, and just 2 of 12 from the 3-point line in a victory over UMBC . Howard finished with 15 points.\n\nSee, nothing to worry about.\n\n\"Markus is an explosive offensive player,\" Wojciechowski said. \"I was never concerned about his shooting. He's a guy that with the law of averages, it's going to average out.\"\n\nHoward proved his marksmanship from the arc as a freshman, when he led the nation by shooting 54.7 percent, which was also a Marquette single-season record. He shot 40.4 percent from the 3-point line as a sophomore.\n\nThe accuracy is the result, in part, of hours of offseason workouts back home in Arizona.\n\n\"I try to work a lot more on pick-and-roll situations ... and trying to find my man,\" Howard said last month. \"I always incorporate the shooting parts as well.\"\n\nGood plan considering how much deeper that Marquette's roster seems to be this season.\n\nJoey Hauser and Brendan Bailey give added length and athleticism up front as freshmen. Joey Hauser's older brother, Sam, is a steady, do-everything forward who provides leadership. Sacar Anim and Jamal Cain provide athleticism on the wing. Emerging sophomore Theo John can muscle up in the paint.\n\nAdded depth has helped Marquette play better defense, too, after holding the first two opponents to a combined 26 percent shooting. Marquette was 326th out of 351 Division I schools last year in allowing opponents to shoot 47.8 percent.\n\nIf the Golden Eagles can play anything close to the level of defense that they've played over the first week through the course of the season, they should return to the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three years.\n\nSeveral key pieces on the team, including Howard and Sam Hauser, were on the team two years ago that lost in the first round of the NCAAs. They also have the experience of advancing to the NIT quarterfinals last year .\n\n\"The strength of our team is our team. Everybody has to be ready,\" Wojciechowski said. \"At any given moment at any given time, a guy can be a catalyst.\"\n\nMore often than not, Howard is still one of those players.\n\nHe took Big East Player of the Week honors for averaging 26.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 6.0 assists over the first two games. He has scored 30 points eight times in his career, the most for any Marquette player since 1963-64.\n\nThe Golden Eagles might need another all-around effort from Howard to pull out a win in a tough road game at Indiana on Wednesday.\n\n\"I've always kind of been used to dealing with things being thrown at me in terms of the offensive end,\" Howard said. \"As a player in my position, that only excites me more to able to dish to other guys, make sure they're getting their shots.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

USA TODAY\n\nA firefighter works on a home that caught on fire in Oak Park, November 9, 2018. (Photo: Jay Calderon, The Desert Sun-USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nAll it takes is a spark.\n\nDeadly wildfires such as the ones raging in California this week can begin with something as simple as a downed power line, a flat tire or a tossed cigarette butt.\n\nThat spark, combined with tinder-dry forests and howling winds, can be all that's needed for a catastrophic wildfire to start. Once a fire ignites, the combination of heat, oxygen and fuel (trees, brush, etc.) can cause it to explode in size.\n\nAt its height, the Camp Fire was burning the equivalent of 60 football fields per minute. That fire is the deadliest and most destructive in the state of California.\n\nIn the early history of the Earth, nearly all wildfires were started by lightning strikes. Now that humans have come on the scene, we're responsible for the vast majority of fires.\n\nAbout 84 percent of wildfires in the USA are started by people, according to a comprehensive study in 2017 published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nHot, dry weather this summer and fall has been a factor: \"Over the past two months, the areas now burning have had far less precipitation than normal for this time of year, while experiencing above-average temperatures,\" said Jacob Bendix, a geographer at Syracuse University.\n\nUCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said that \"if Northern California had received anywhere near the typical amount of autumn precipitation this year (4-5 inches of rain near the Camp Fire point of origin), the explosive fire behavior and the stunning tragedy in Paradise would almost certainly not have occurred.\"\n\nIt was also very hot: \"The entire state was above average with the Sierra Nevada region (the Camp Fire location) having the warmest summer on record,\" Swain said.\n\n\"Thus, conditions were primed for fire,\" Bendix said.\n\nMore: Before-and-after images show damage from California fires\n\nMore: Winds from hell: Notorious 'Santa Anas' fuel ferocious California wildfires\n\nMore: Global heat, fires and floods: How much did climate change fuel that hellish July?\n\nMore: Wildfire risk rises with 43 million US homes near land susceptible to blazes\n\n'Wildland urban interface'\n\nAs in the hurricanes in the South and East, we've got a lot more valuable stuff in the way of fires than we used to. Development makes wildfires more costly and dangerous by putting more homes in areas with high risk of fires.\n\nPlain and simple, \"we are building more homes in the line of fire,\" University of Colorado geographer Jennifer Balch said.\n\nOverall, as of 2010, about 43 million homes in the USA were in what scientists call the \"wildland-urban interface,\" defined as the area where residential homes are built on or near wildland vegetation, such as trees and shrubs.\n\nTwenty years earlier, 31 million homes were in those areas. That's an increase of 41 percent.\n\nClimate change a culprit?\n\nHumans aren't only starting the fires, we're also worsening their severity through global warming, especially in the western USA. \u201cThe wildfires burning in California provide a reminder that our changing climate and weather are powerful drivers of catastrophic fires,\" Bendix said.\n\nSwain said, \"California, like the rest of the world, is warming due to climate change. Fire season, along with the rest of the year, is getting warmer.\"\n\nClimate change is caused by the increase of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that are created by burning fossil fuels. Greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere, trap heat and warm the planet.\n\nRising temperatures dry out grasses and brush, making them easier to ignite. Strong winds \u2013 such as the infamous Santa Anas in Southern California \u2013 can rapidly move fires and increase their size.\n\nLarge fires are becoming more common: In terms of acres burned in California, 15 of the state's 20 largest wildfires have occurred since 2000, according to Cal Fire.\n\n\"To ignore the link between climate change and wildfires is to put lives and property at risk,\" Balch said.\n\n\"What\u2019s going on out West is eventually going to hit around the world (including the eastern USA) unless we curb fossil fuel burning,\" University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck warned.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/13/california-fires-how-do-wildfires-start-they-getting-worse/1987691002/", "CLOSE Just like a bad break up, we point out the flaws that Amazon saw in your city's bid for their second headquarters.

Veuer's Chandra Lanier has the story. Buzz60\n\n\"The debate over who gets to live in Victimville fascinates me, as a public person who has watched strangers discuss my own 'victim' status at length on social media,\" Lewinsky wrote. (Photo: Matt Winkelmeyer, Getty Images)\n\nWith \"The Clinton Affair,\" Monica Lewinsky is ready to revisit the 1998 sex scandal that nearly unraveled Bill Clinton's presidency, and she hopes by doing so she can retire the term \"Lewinsky scandal\" once and for all.\n\n\"I think 20 years is enough time to carry that mantle,\" the former White House intern, now 45, writes in a new Vanity Fair essay published Tuesday.\n\nIn the essay, she explains what motivated her to take part in the 6 1/2-hour series, which premieres Sunday (9 EST/PST) from Emmy-winning producer Blair Foster (\"Get Me Roger Stone,\" \"Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind\") and Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney (\"Taxi to the Dark Side,\" \"The Looming Tower\").\n\nFoster, she says, \"pointed out to me during one of the tapings that almost all the books written about the Clinton impeachment were written by men. History literally being written by men. In contrast, the docuseries not only includes more women\u2019s voices, but embodies a woman\u2019s gaze: Two of the three main editors and four of the five executive producers are women.\"\n\nAnother impetus, she says, was grief: \"Grief for the pain I caused others. Grief for the broken young woman I had been before and during my time in D.C., and the shame I still felt around that. Grief for having been betrayed first by someone I thought was my friend, and then by a man I thought had cared for me. Grief for the years and years lost, being seen only as 'That Woman' \u2013 saddled, as a young woman, with the false narrative that my mouth was merely a receptacle for a powerful man\u2019s desire. (You can imagine how those constructs impacted my personal and professional life.)\"\n\nShe admits she wishes she could erase her memories of her Washington years, but realizes, \"in order to move forward in the life I have, I must take risks \u2013 both professional and emotional. (It\u2019s a combustible combination.) An important part of moving forward is excavating, often painfully, what has gone before.\"\n\nShe adds, \"When politicians are asked uncomfortable questions, they often duck and dodge by saying, That\u2019s old news. It\u2019s in the past. Yes. That\u2019s exactly where we need to start to heal.\"\n\nAnd even though Lewinsky made personal apologies to Hillary Clinton in a 1999 interview with Barbara Walters, she says that if she saw the former first lady, secretary of state and presidential candidate in person, she'd say it all over again.\n\n\"I would summon up whatever force I needed to again acknowledge to her \u2013 sincerely \u2013 how very sorry I am,\" she writes.\n\nAs for ever getting an apology from the ex-president himself, she says, \"What feels more important to me than whether I am owed or deserving of a personal apology is my belief that Bill Clinton should want to apologize. I\u2019m less disappointed by him, and more disappointed for him. He would be a better man for it ... and we, in turn, a better society.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/11/13/monica-lewinsky-ready-share-responsibility-clinton-affair/1987875002/", "CLOSE USA TODAY Sports' NFL power rankings following Week 10 of the season, with the Patriots dropping and the Eagles falling even further.

Saints (1): Hopefully for him, Brandon Marshall makes as strong an impression on his new teammates as Dez Bryant did. Marshall's seventh team should be lucky for him given he never played a postseason game for any of his other six NFL employers.\n\n2. Chiefs (4): Game against Rams shaping up as matchup of season, even if it doesn't have an international flair after being moved from Mexico City.\n\n3. Rams (2): O-line unfairly overshadowed amid pyrotechnics. Let's hope LT Andrew Whitworth's donation to Borderline Bar and Grill victims gets just due.\n\n4. Steelers (6): Big Ben and Co. are scoring almost at will and basically masking resurgent defense ceding fewer than 255 yards per week over last month.\n\n5. Chargers (5): This Sunday will mark their first game at home in six weeks, but they've bolted to six straight wins nonetheless. However injury bug returned to claim LB Denzel Perryman.\n\n6. Patriots (3): Good news \u2014 remainder of regular-season schedule offers no showdowns with Eric Mangini, Romeo Crennel or even pushover Bill O'Brien.\n\n7. Vikings (8): Better be rested out of bye because they only have two home games before Christmas.

Bears (12): As my colleague Nancy Armour would tell you, Mitch Trubisky could become first Chicago QB to pass for 4,000 yards and/or 30 TDs in a season. Crazy.\n\n9. Redskins (14): If slow and steady wins the race, Washington is \u2014 ever methodically \u2014 building cushion that may be too much for Eagles or Cowboys to pop.\n\n10. Panthers (7): Beating they took in Pittsburgh fresh reminder they haven't won big road games under Cam Newton. And now starting to lose sight of Saints in NFC South.\n\n11. Titans (19): Only person who loves facing Patriots more than Mike Vrabel is WR Corey Davis, who's collected three of four career TDs vs. New England.\n\nFAN RANKINGS: We want your ranking from 1 to 32\n\n12. Texans (13): Tennessee, which beat Houston in Week 2, suddenly looms as clear and present danger in battle for AFC South supremacy. Rematch in Week 12.\n\n13. Packers (15): They're back at .500 but now head to their personal house of horrors, CenturyLink Field, a place where the Pack hasn't won in a decade.\n\n14. Bengals (10): On pace to smash record for most yards allowed in a season (more than 2,100 surrendered last four weeks), hence Teryl Austin's dismissal.\n\n15. Seahawks (17): It's a formality anyway, but after being swept by Rams, Seattle could set up 'MNF' clinching opportunity for L.A. by losing to Green Bay.\n\n16. Cowboys (20): Maybe they won on the trade front with Amari Cooper getting further involved in attack and field seeming to open up for Ezekiel Elliott.\n\nMore: Eagles' reality check against Cowboys reveals a team in crisis\n\nMore: Patriots won't be derailed by loss to Titans, but playoff picture just got tougher\n\n17. Eagles (9): Maybe they lost on the trade front with Golden Tate making little impact in his debut and obvious holes remaining at RB and in secondary.\n\n18. Browns (24): With Baker Mayfield \"feeling real dangerous,\" Cleveland ensures it won't lose more than a dozen games for first time since 2014. Progress.\n\n19. Falcons (11): Julio Jones became fastest to 10,000 career receiving yards \u2014 in Cleveland, where he never would've attained mark had Browns drafted him.\n\n20. Ravens (16): Welp. If Lamar Jackson must be pressed into service, at least he'd get to make starting debut against league's worst (ever?) defense \u2014 Cincinnati.\n\n21. Colts (27): Dearest mother \u2014 Andrew Luck hasn't come under enemy fire once (sacked) in Indy's last four engagements. The men truly love their commander.\n\n22. Dolphins (18): So no literal victory coming out of Green Bay, but at least Miami got a moral one given nobody on defense quit this week. Yay.\n\n23. Buccaneers (23): Stats lie. We call into evidence Exhibit A \u2014 Tampa Bay's offense, which is ranked No. 1 in the NFL. Sound and fury, signifying nothing.\n\n24. Jaguars (21): Three months ago, we were really looking forward to them drawing the hated Steelers in Jacksonville. Now, no one cares. Especially NBC.\n\n25. Bills (31): Maybe they once had dreams of landing USC's Sam Darnold but are perhaps now better off with ex-Trojan Matt Barkley. LOLOLOL.\n\n26. Jets (25): Horrendous as Sunday was, this will be fairly attractive job to some coach not named Todd Bowles. Young QB, talent on D, loads of cap space.\n\nMore: Rex Ryan rips into Todd Bowles, Jets: 'They're going to blow it up'\n\n27. Broncos (26): First order of business coming out of bye? Putting C Matt Paradis, one of league's most underrated performers, on IR. That kind of year.\n\n28. Lions (22): It ain't exactly the Curse of Bobby Layne, but Detroit has looked pretty lifeless since shipping former No. 1 receiver Golden Tate to Philly.\n\n29. Giants (30): For one night, at least, their stars \u2014 Eli, Odell, Saquon \u2014 aligned to provide a glimpse of the team New York had hoped to be in 2018.\n\n30. Cardinals (28): Who would be your all-time three-receiver set? Lots of interesting options and combos, but we'll take Rice, Moss and Fitz in the slot.\n\n31. 49ers (29): Not a very good reflection of your defense when it only manages to sack Eli Manning once and doesn\u2019t get much pressure beyond that.\n\n32.

I felt like they brought me in to make the playoffs.\"\n\nWade replaces Amber Stocks, who was let go after compiling a 25-43 record in two seasons with Chicago. The Sky didn't make the playoffs either year.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wade was an assistant with the San Antonio Stars from 2012-16 before joining the Lynx. He was with Minnesota for two seasons and now inherits a roster led by guards Courtney Vandersloot and Allie Quigley. The Sky drafted Diamond DeShields and Gabby Williams last season with the third and fourth picks and have the No. 4 pick in next year's draft.\n\n\"One of the main things I think we need to focus on is defense and we need to find an identity,\" he said.\n\nWade credits former Stars coach Dan Hughes for being the main reason he became a coach in 2010, when he finished playing overseas. Wade talked over the offer an internship with his wife Edwige Lawson-Wade, who played in the WNBA. She joked that he'd be mopping up the floor and getting towels for players.\n\n\"It couldn't have been further from the truth,\" Wade said. \"Even as an intern (Hughes) made sure that I was learning and involved. I saw my confidence grow from there and I became very committed to be the best coach I can be.\"\n\nWade will spend a few more days in Chicago before heading back overseas to Russia to work with UMMC-Ekaterinburg, which features an All-Star roster that includes Brittney Griner, Jonquel Jones, Emma Meesseman and Vandersloot, now his point guard.\n\n\"It will be great to continue to work with Sloot,\" Wade said.\n\nOne of the strengths that drew Chicago Sky owner Michael Alter to Wade was his ability to relate to the players.\n\n\"The real attraction was everyone I talked to around the league, players, coaches, really talked about what a great relationship builder he is,\" Alter said. \"Develop them and get the best out of them.\"\n\nThe hiring means there is one open head coaching position in the WNBA with the Dallas Wings.\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/dougfeinberg\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Peter Dasilva, EPA)\n\nThe canyon walls plunge to the Feather River from the edge of Paradise, California, and there are many hazards. The ones I remember best are the rattlesnakes.\n\nThe land still felt wild outside my uncle's front door, and when he and I slipped and careened down to the water for a frigid summer swim we passed an old snake-infested mine, relic of a time when there was still much to be discovered, extracted, cut down around here. I only visited a couple of times as a kid and then my uncle moved, but Paradise is the very image of the American West in my mind.\n\nAll of it is gone in the Camp Fire.\n\nGone like my neighbors' homes in Redding, California, a small regional city about 90 minutes north, where I live now. In late July, the Carr Fire burned tree to tree, then house to house, and left some of our most spectacular natural vistas barren and black.\n\nGone like the one-room cabin where I lived as a child, on the edge of National Forest land near Yosemite National Park. A wildfire last summer burned it down.\n\nIn September my wife and I got away to Santa Monica for a weekend alone. We drove up the coast to taste wine in the Malibu Hills. The Woolsey Fire just burned those.\n\nStalked by wildfire\n\nTo live in California in 2018 is to be stalked by wildfire.\n\nThe images from Paradise show the worst-case scenario: lines of melted and abandoned cars. People plunged out into the inferno rather than stay inside and burn alive. These metal hulks stand near decimated mobile home parks, where the folks were poor and old, and sometimes alone.\n\nMore: Kansas turned blue? Democrats like me were elected to bring back common sense, civility\n\nWhy so busy? Our flawed college system takes toll on families years before tuition is due\n\nRepay dogs for their military service. Stop the deadly VA canine experiments.\n\nThe death toll, already California's worst, will almost certainly still rise.\n\nHow are we doing out here? Not that well.\n\nAs a journalist, I'm better than I should be at compartmentalizing emotions. But I'm badly shaken. Each new column of smoke sends us scrambling to find the kid and the cat and start pulling out the evacuation boxes. My colleagues are tired and wary, my friends are on edge.\n\nMany of us also are good and angry.\n\nLike New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina, none of this is a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention. In place of bad levees we have dry forests, tangled with brush and debris. Unlike Katrina, the repercussions of bad policies and unintended consequences aren't just one catastrophic event.\n\nThe fire comes over, and over and over. It's relentless in punishing our mistakes.\n\nPolicy mistakes turn to environmental disaster\n\nThe men who dug those mines a century and longer ago, who fed forests into sawmills and sneered in contempt at the wildland wisdom of native peoples, may have committed the original sins. But the generations that followed are no less culpable.\n\nIn response to rapacious logging, environmental lawsuits and regulations shut the chainsaws out of the forests without any reasonable plan to replace their work of thinning and fire-breaking.\n\nThe Carr Fire, as seen from the author's driveway in Redding, California, on July 26, 2018, just before the author's family evacuated. (Photo: Family handout)\n\nWe pursued policies of aggressively extinguishing small beneficial wildfires, instead letting vegetation build up until it was so combustible that there was almost no such thing as a small, \"good\" fire anymore and suppression was the only logical approach.\n\nWe starved the U.S. Forest Service for resources by waiting until earlier this year to fix its budget so that prevention work was kept separate from emergency firefighting funds.\n\nAnd all the while, we kept building our homes in and near the forests.\n\nClimate change, which doesn't care if you believe in it, provided the final spark. Historic droughts, heat waves, crackling dry humidity \u2014 combine them with the dense fuels and an inopportune wind and you don't get fires. You get explosions. You get phenomena that are behaviorally identical to tornadoes.\n\nYou get Redding. And Paradise. And Malibu. And Santa Rosa. And Thousand Oaks.\n\nThese days in America, it seems like everyone's on Team Red or Team Blue. But last week, fire burned the homes of rich liberals in Malibu and poor white folks in Paradise. It didn't care, and neither should we.\n\nThere has to be a better way.\n\nI remain hopeful for reasonable compromise, for common-sense forest management that would make our communities safe again. But I'm going to keep scanning the horizon for smoke.\n\nRattlesnakes are no longer the scariest thing in that forest.\n\nSilas Lyons is executive editor for north central California for the USA TODAY Network.

That number was up from 834 cases involving 862 people the previous year. Though the numbers were on the rise, the bureau reported that the increase corresponded with an uptick in the number of agencies reporting such crimes to the FBI.\n\nLast year, about 1,000 additional agencies submitted data to the bureau.\n\nThe report prompted calls from law enforcement and civil rights advocates for a new focus on such attacks.\n\n\"This report is a call to action \u2013 and we will heed that call,\" acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said Tuesday. \"The Department of Justice\u2019s top priority is to reduce violent crime in America, and hate crimes are violent crimes.

The anti-immigrant attack against the Indian man left Kuchibhotla's friend, Alok Madasani, wounded.\n\n\"The reported increase in the FBI's hate crime statistics warrants concern, as do the discrepancies between state and federal hate crime data, the omission of several high-profile hate crime incidents and the limited rate of hate crime reporting in some jurisdictions,\" the Arab American Institute said Tuesday.\n\nSikh Coalition Legal Director Amrith Kaur said law enforcement agencies need additional training to recognize and report hate-motivated offenses.\n\n\u201cWhile everybody should be horrified by these jaw-dropping statistics, these numbers still fail to paint a complete picture of the enormity of the problem,\u201d Kaur said.\n\nThe alleged shooter in the Pittsburgh attack, Robert Bowers, was charged in a 44-count indictment and could face the death penalty if convicted.

(Photo: Bill Streicher, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nA week ago, Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman slammed the Cowboys for organizational \"dysfunction\" and called a 28-14 loss to the Titans as bad of a defeat as he could remember.\n\nA 27-20 Cowboys win over the defending champion Eagles shifted the FOX NFL analyst's tone.\n\nCould Dallas, at 4-5 and two games behind Washington, escape with the division?\n\n\u201cRight now, if I had to pick someone, I\u2019d pick Dallas,\u201d Aikman said Tuesday morning on his weekly Dallas radio appearance with \u201cThe Musers\u201d on KTCK-FM 96.7 The Ticket. \u201cThe Thanksgiving game (between them) is huge.\n\n\u201cIf Dallas can keep it within two games going into Thanksgiving, win that game, I think they\u2019re positioned well.\u201d\n\nWashington improved to 6-3 in Tampa Bay on Sunday, but the win didn\u2019t come easily. A Redskins defense that has anchored the team\u2019s success this year forced four Buccaneers turnovers and gave up only 3 points. But it allowed 501 yards of offense, a formula for winning \u201cthat\u2019s unheard of,\u201d Aikman said.\n\nAnd offensive tackle Geron Christian became Washington's third lineman to suffer a season-ending injury in the last two weeks.\n\nThat could leave the Cowboys in a favorable position for their rematch with Washington. At FedEx Field in October, Dallas kicker Brett Maher missed a potentially game-tying field goal as time expired.\n\n\u201cThe next week or so will be interesting to see what happens,\u201d Aikman said.\n\nMore: NFL power rankings: Saints remain No. 1, but rest of top 10 gets a shakeup\n\nMore: Jerry Jones addresses rumors linking Cowboys to Oklahoma's Lincoln Riley\n\nThe Cowboys travel to Atlanta this week to play a Falcons team coming off a 28-16 loss to the Browns. The Falcons destroyed the Cowboys 27-7 last year, sacking Dak Prescott eight times in the process. But Dallas was without both running back Ezekiel Elliott (suspended) and left tackle Tyron Smith in that game, and defensive end Adrian Clayborn, who signed with the Patriots this offseason, accounted for six of Atlanta's sacks.\n\nPrescott also took four sacks Sunday night in Philadelphia and got lucky on a near pick-six in the first quarter. But he engineered two fourth-quarter scoring drives to secure a win at Lincoln Financial Field \u2013 a win that Aikman said \u201cspoke volumes\u201d to the Cowboys\u2019 mindset right now.\n\nDid Prescott\u2019s performance speak loudly enough to warrant a contract extension from the Cowboys?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big Dak Prescott fan, was really happy for him to come out and respond the way he did,\u201d Aikman said. \u201cIf you do invest that money in him, you know what you\u2019re going to get.\n\n\u201cWith Dak, I know he\u2019ll be even more committed to being great and helping team win championship.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s no need to rush an extension, though, Aikman said.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pay him but longer you can hold off to be certain of evaluations, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that either,\" Aikman said.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones, who said last week that Prescott is \"young and going to be extended,\" may think similarly.\n\n\u201cFrom what I gather with Jerry, that\u2019s really the approach he\u2019s taken,\u201d Aikman said. \u201cDoes it make sense to pay Dak right away? Maybe.

WXIA\n\n636767700663235118-VPC-KEMP-VS-ABRAMS-THUMB-1-.jpg (Photo: GETTY)\n\nATLANTA \u2013 A federal judge has ordered Georgia election officials to review all provisional ballots cast in the midterm elections and prohibited the state from certifying the election before Friday.\n\nAnd another judge ruled Tuesday that absentee ballots that have been rejected because there were problems with the date of birth must be counted.\n\nGeorgia's bitterly fought contest for governor remains undecided. Republican Brian Kemp leads Democrat Stacey Abrams by nearly 59,000 votes.\n\nKemp has declared himself the winner of the vote last week, resigned as Georgia's secretary of state and named a transition team.\n\nAbrams has refused to concede. Supporters have filed legal challenges demanding that deadlines for accepting ballots and certifying counts be extended and that rejected ballots be reconsidered.\n\nThe legal battle ignited protests at the Georgia State Capitol on Tuesday where at least 15 people were arrested including State Senator Nikema Williams.\n\nProtesters were demanding that every vote be counted in the midterm election.\n\nIn a ruling released late Monday, U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ordered election officials to provide reports explaining why each voter was required to cast a provisional ballot, and to establish a hotline or website where voters can determine whether their provisional ballot was counted.\n\nCounties are required to certify their counts by 5 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nBefore Totenberg's ruling, state elections officials had planned to certify the election on Wednesday. State law requires the secretary of state \u2013 now Kemp's successor, Robyn Crittenden \u2013 to certify it by Nov. 20.\n\nTotenberg ruled in response to a lawsuit filed by Common Cause Georgia against Kemp in his capacity as secretary of state. The watchdog group accused Kemp of carelessly administering an election where there was an \"unsecure, unreliable voter registration database.\"\n\n\"According to plaintiff\u2019s complaint,\" Totenberg wrote, \"information in the state\u2019s voter registration server, used at the polls to determine whether voters are eligible to vote, is vulnerable to multiple security breaches and exploitable by manipulation of voter data.\"\n\nShe noted that 21,190 provisional ballots were cast in the midterms.\n\nCommon Cause Georgia sought to ensure all provisional ballots cast by eligible voters were properly counted. Director Sara Henderson called the ruling \"a victory for the voters of Georgia.\"\n\n\"We are all stronger when every eligible voter is allowed to participate in our elections,\" she said in a statement. \"This victory helps achieve greater voter confidence in our elections.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the secretary of state said officials are reviewing the order and considering their options with legal counsel.\n\nIn a separate ruling Tuesday, a federal judge said that absentee ballots that were rejected because of problems with the date of birth must be counted.\n\nLauren Groh-Wargo, Abrams\u2019 campaign manager, called the court rulings \u201cwins for Georgians' fundamental right \u2014 the right to cast a ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the confusion sowed by the Secretary of State's office last week and the number of voters who experienced irregularities regarding their registration status, these victories were necessary steps in the fight to count every eligible vote in Georgia,\u201d Groh-Wargo said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe remain grateful to groups like Common Cause who know this is about more than just one campaign \u2014 it is about committing to a fairer, more democratic system.\"\n\nKemp's campaign maintains that he will prevail despite the court rulings.\n\n\u201cWhile Democrats attempt to undermine Brian Kemp\u2019s convincing victory seven days ago, we remain confident in the local elections officials who are certifying the results,\u201d spokesman Cody Hall said in a statement.\n\nAbrams, 44, is trying to become the first Democrat elected governor in Georgia in 20 years, and the first black woman governor in the nation. Kemp, 55, is trying to keep the office in Republican hands.\n\nDuring the campaign, Abrams and her supporters accused Kemp, who as secretary of state was Georgia\u2019s top election official, of trying to suppress the Democratic vote by removing voters from the state rolls.\n\nKemp\u2019s office said it was investigating the state Democratic Party for what it called a \"failed attempt to hack the state's voter registration system.\"\n\nBoth sides denounced a racist robocall targeting Abrams.\n\nAbrams' supporters believe there could be enough outstanding ballots to trigger a recount, or a runoff election.\n\nA runoff election, held when no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, would pit the top two \u2013 Kemp and Abrams \u2013 in a head-to-head vote next month.\n\nAbrams' campaign filed a lawsuit Sunday asking a federal judge to order elections officials to count rejected absentee and provisional ballots in the governor's race, and to move the deadline for counties to certify the election to Wednesday. It also asked that provisional ballots from Georgians who were registered in one county but voted in another be counted.\n\nU.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones heard arguments in the case during a hearing Tuesday. He is expected to issue a ruling by noon Wednesday, according to Kurt Kastorf, an attorney for the Abrams campaign.\n\nCrittenden, the secretary of state, issued a letter to county election officials on Monday afternoon instructing them to accept absentee ballots that are missing the voter's date of birth. She said officials can verify the voter's identity with their signature or other information provided on the ballot.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/13/georgia-governor-federal-judge-provisional-ballots-brian-kemp-stacey-abrams/1986415002/", "", "Washington State running back James Williams, top, jumps over Colorado defensive back Dante Wigley in the second half of an NCAA college football game Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018, in Boulder, Colo.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWhile quarterback Gardner Minshew is getting most of the attention, running backs James Williams and Max Borghi have also helped fuel the rise of No. 8 Washington State this season.\n\nWilliams and Borghi play key roles in the complex Air Raid offense, which is mostly geared to passing.\n\nIn Saturday's 31-7 blowout of Colorado, the Cougars rushed a season-high 33 times for 131 yards. The two running backs added eight catches for 77 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns.\n\n\"I think one of the biggest things was how good our running game was today,\" Minshew said afterward. \"Our O-line and our running backs hit it hard.\"\n\nCoach Mike Leach likes to point out that the Air Raid depends heavily on running backs who serve as blockers and receivers.\n\n\"You have to rush, catch and block at WSU,\" Leach said. \"Not just one of the three. You have to do all three.\"\n\nThe backs have certainly done their part in protecting Minshew, who has been sacked just seven times this season. The Cougars, meantime, have sacked opposing quarterbacks 30 times.\n\n\"We got two running backs who can do it all,\" Williams said.\n\nWashington State (9-1, 6-1 Pac-12) can win the Pac-12 North if it beats Arizona on Saturday night and rival Washington on Nov. 23. The Cougars also have an outside chance of making the College Football Playoff for the first time if they win out.\n\nThe Cougars are where they are thanks in part to Williams, a 205-pound junior, and Borghi, a freshman.\n\nWilliams, who is from Burbank, California, has rushed for 437 yards and nine touchdowns and he leads the team with 63 receptions, good for 506 yards and another three touchdowns.\n\n\"James does a good job of making people miss when he is in space,\" Leach said. \"He can do everything you ask a running back to do.\"\n\nWilliams said he has improved as a rusher by concentrating on hitting holes.\n\n\"I used to have a problem with bouncing things out when I shouldn't have,\" Williams said.\n\nWhile Williams is a shifty and powerful rusher, the 5-foot-10 Borghi is low to the ground and rushes through gaps in the line. Leach said they complement each other with their play.\n\nBorghi has rushed for 283 yards and six touchdowns this season, and caught 34 passes for 238 yards and four more scores.\n\nAs a team, the Cougars have rushed for 18 touchdowns this season, three more than their opponents. The Cougars rushed for just eight touchdowns last season.\n\nOf course, they don't call it the Air Raid for nothing. The Cougars rank first in the nation in passing yardage, but only 128th among FBS teams with an average of 77 rushing yards per game.\n\nBorghi, who was in high school in Colorado at this time last year, has been a revelation. He reminds many of former Stanford standout Christian McCaffrey, who now plays in the NFL. The two have worked out together in the past.\n\n\"I don't know where his ceiling is,\" Leach said. \"We are kind of in the business of not having ceilings.\"\n\nBorghi spurned offers from Colorado and Stanford to come to Pullman.\n\n\"Everyone was projecting us to go 3-9 and have a horrible season,\" Borghi said. \"It's been fun proving everyone wrong, and it's pretty much us versus everybody.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

A world of coffee lovers.\n\nMore than 2 billion cups of coffee are consumed every day around the world and the industry employs more than 125 million people globally. Also, \u201cThe Enlightenment was born in Europe\u2019s coffeehouses,\u201d Jacobs reminds us, and over the centuries, \u201chas helped create international trade and shape our modern economy.\u201d\n\n2. Coffee used to be just\u2026gross.\n\nWhile it has its share of health benefits now, in centuries past, coffee was \u201coften contaminated, dangerous, and just plain revolting.\u201d It was so bad that a very long-ago headline from The New York Times warned of \u201cPoison in Every Cup of Coffee.\u201d Among the many oddities and impurities found in java around the world: coal ashes, dirt, brewery waste, arsenic and lead. Thank Teddy Roosevelt for signing the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 that helped put an end to that.\n\n3. It\u2019s not just coffee that belongs on the gratitude list.\n\nJacobs confesses that for all his good intentions, there are moments when he slips into the disgruntled, impatient state modern life seems to engender. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I\u2019m feeling particularly annoyed by something \u2013 the rattle of the air conditioner, say, I\u2019ll repeat a three-word phrase: \u2018Surgery without anesthesia.\u2019\u201d He does have a point, there.\n\n\"Thanks a Thousand\" by A.J.

Don\u2019t forget the goat herder.\n\nIf we are to believe the legend, if there is anybody we should thank for the coffee that gets us up and going and keeps us going, it\u2019s a man named Kaldi. It\u2019s said that this 9th-century Ethiopian goat herder noticed his goats jumping after eating coffee berries, which he then decided to try himself.\n\n5. One thank you leads to another.\n\nIt\u2019s not only true of coffee, which leads Jacobs to thank truckers, ironworkers, steel manufacturers, and look into the world of shipping pallets, which has been called the \u201cmost important object in the global economy.\u201d Gratitude is due to the countless people and circumstances in our lives.

Fires continue to burn throughout the state and so far have killed more than 40 people and burned more that 6,000 structures and around 200,000 acres.\n\n\"Wanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"I am with you all the way.

It is the federal government that has chosen to divert resources away from forest management, not California.\"\n\nIn a recent meeting with officials trying to grapple with both California fires, Brown tried to focus on the larger picture, which is the possibility of such conflagrations being the new normal on a planet whose climate is steadily heating up.\n\n\u201cWe have a real challenge here, threatening our whole way of life,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt is a time of sadness, but also one to reflect on where we are and resolve to pull together and do everything we can to help those in need.\u201d\n\nThose affected by the wildfires wanting to know more about federal funding eligibility can visit www.DisasterAssistance.gov or call officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 800-621-FEMA (3362).\n\nCurrent details related to this Major Disaster Declaration can also be found on FEMA's website at www.fema.gov/disaster/4407.\n\nFires burn toward homes on, Nov. 9, 2018, as seen from a helicopter over the Calabasas section of Los Angeles.

Wilson returned to the lineup after his 20-game suspension was reduced to 14 by a neutral arbitrator. (AP Photo/Jim Mone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nWashington Capitals forward Tom Wilson had his 20-game suspension reduced to 14 games by a neutral arbitrator on Tuesday and became eligible to play immediately, scoring a goal and taking two penalties in 16:47 of ice time at Minnesota in a 5-2 win over the Wild .\n\nWilson already served 16 games of his suspension for an illegal check to the head of St. Louis forward Oskar Sundqvist in each team's preseason finale. The ruling by Shyam Das allowed Wilson to will recoup $378,049 of the $1.26 million he initially forfeited as part of the suspension.\n\nThe 20-game ban handed down by the NHL's department of player safety came after the 24-year-old Wilson was suspended three previous times in 13 months.\n\n\"Some hits, he's going to have to avoid. They're too risky,\" general manager Brian MacLellan said. \"He's going to have to avoid some hits and he's going to have to let up on some hits also. You can't have the same force because he hits hard and it looks bad, and sometimes he's going to be evaluated on the force.\"\n\nCommissioner Gary Bettman upheld Wilson's suspension on appeal before it went to Das, the same arbitrator who earlier this season reduced Nashville forward Austin Watson's domestic violence suspension from 27 games to 18.\n\nSince September 2017, Wilson had been suspended two preseason games for interference against the Blues' Robert Thomas, four games for boarding the Blues' Sammy Blais and three playoff games for an illegal check to the head of the Penguins' Zach Aston-Reese.\n\n\"I've had lots of time to think about it and dissect parts of my game,\" Wilson told reporters in Minnesota after the team's morning skate. \"At full speed, the rink's not getting any bigger and guys are getting stronger and faster. Some of those hits at full speed, whether I can or can't make those anymore and just putting myself in a good position not to have the ball in their court and make sure I'm controlling my end of it and make sure I'm controlling what I can do.\"\n\nWilson took a goaltender interference penalty as he scored late in the first period and later dropped the gloves with the Wild's Marcus Foligno for a five-minute fighting major. The Capitals left for Winnipeg and a game on Wednesday night against the Jets, a back-to-back test for Wilson's conditioning.\n\n\"It was a good day and good to get back in there,\" Wilson said afterward. \"It's tough watching the guys play, but once you get back and get in there, get in the room, get in the game day routine there's no better feeling.\"\n\nDas wrote in his 42-page opinion that he agreed with the league that Wilson violated Rule 48 with an illegal check to the head and was not persuaded by the Players' Association's arguments that included a suggested eight-game suspension. Das also wrote: \"The length of the 20-game suspension imposed was not supported by substantial evidence\" and decided on 14 by treating the three-game playoff suspension as six, doubling it given Wilson's recent history and adding two games for Sundqvist's concussion and shoulder injury.\n\n\"The league did what they thought was appropriate,\" Aston-Reese said recently when asked about Wilson's latest suspension. \"When the league comes down like that, you've always got to re-think your game. I'm sure he's just doing what he thinks is best for him.\"\n\nDas is the same neutral arbitrator fired by Major League Baseball in 2012 after he overturned Ryan Braun's drug suspension. The NHL fired arbitrator James Oldham in 2016 after his decision to reduce Dennis Wideman's 20-game suspension to 10 for striking and injuring an official.\n\nWilson's appeals process took almost a month and a half between Bettman and Das hearing the case. That caused Wilson to sit out extra games even after his suspension was reduced.\n\n\"We talked about it going in trying to get a decision earlier, but it seems to be the process the arbitrator needed,\" MacLellan said. \"The (Players' Association) asked to have it done earlier, but he needed the two weeks to get it done.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dave Campbell in St. Paul, Minn., and The Canadian Press contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The process enabled those applicants to refine their pitches to prospective investors and identify areas where they need to improve, such as transit, labor and quality of life, she said.\n\nAfter a brief period in which hundreds of cities were in the mix, Amazon had narrowed it down to 20 contenders. Some areas had multiple contenders on the list, such as D.C. itself, southern Maryland and Northern Virginia, which ultimately prevailed.\n\n\"I feel like the process was pretty carefully done, and these other communities really did have a chance,\" Cruickshank said.\n\nResentment, however, is already building.\n\nAmazon critic Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, called the search process \"a giant ruse\" and said the selection of Nashville, Tennessee, for 5,000 jobs is \"a head-fake\" that will fool \"many journalists\" into not applying appropriate scrutiny to the online giant.\n\nAmazon, she said on Twitter, is a monopoly that will use the new headquarters to extend its influence over the news media capital of New York and the center of government in D.C.\n\n\"Amazon is expanding in the nation\u2019s two major centers of power, because it intends to envelope, smother and usurp that power for itself,\" Mitchell wrote.\n\nOne alternative view: Cities that lost actually won. Critics of tax incentives say cities shouldn't hand over the kitchen sink to corporations like Amazon.\n\n\"Despite arguments in support of economic development subsidies, both theory and experience suggest that cities and states are throwing their money away when they court Amazon\u2019s favor through subsidies,\" wrote Michael Farren, research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, which conducts research promoting free market policies, in a report.\n\nHe said \"these kinds of targeted economic development incentives fail to produce economic growth.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, Amazon described its HQ2 search process as a plan to diversify its base of operations away from its main headquarters in Seattle. The company has said it seriously considered areas throughout the country.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to build new headquarters in New York City and Northern Virginia,\u201d Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. \u201cThese two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come.

Rockets GM Daryl Morey told reporters on Sunday that Anthony will not be waived and is being unfairly \u201csingled out\u201d by the media, but ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Tuesday that Anthony\u2019s camp is making contact with other NBA front offices.\n\nAnthony signed a one-year contract for the veteran\u2019s minimum in the offseason, but as the new-look Rockets have struggled on both ends of the floor and lost seven of their first 12 games, many fans and analysts have pointed to Anthony as a source of the team\u2019s issues. The stats don\u2019t lie \u2013 when Carmelo is on the floor, the Rockets are nine points worse per 100 possessions.\n\nAfter the news broke that the Rockets were looking to move on from Anthony, his close friends Dwyane Wade and LeBron James defended Carmelo on Twitter.\n\nTrying to make my guy @carmeloanthony the fall guy huh!?

Which is so far from being true. I can name 50 people Melo better than right now in the NBA. I can name 50 people he\u2019s a better teammate than. So don\u2019t believe this narrative they\u2019re trying to put out there that Melo is just a cancer and he can\u2019t play and he just makes every team bad.

Pool, Getty Images", "The Rams beat the Seahawks for the second time this season on Sunday, moving their record to 9-1 and coming ever closer to wrapping up their second straight NFC West title. It was a good day in L.A. after a very difficult week that included a mass shooting and destructive fires in Thousand Oaks, where the team trains.\n\nBut the Rams also got hit with a spike strip to their hyperactive offense when receiver Cooper Kupp went down in the fourth quarter of that 36-31 win with a torn ACL that will end his season. Kupp had already been battling through a knee injury earlier in the year, but after missing two weeks in October, he\u2019d been back to form, catching five passes for 89 yards in Week 9 against the Saints, and five more passes for 39 yards against Seattle before his season came to an abrupt end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss for our football team,\u201d head coach Sean McVay said Monday, per The Rams Wire. \u201cHe\u2019s such an important part of what we do. Great football player, great person, and it\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nThe Rams will work Josh Reynolds back into the rotation\u2014Reynolds caught five of his own passes for 28 yards against the Packers in Week 8\u2014and receiver Robert Woods will likely take some of Kupp\u2019s responsibilities both in the slot and outside.\n\nStill, as McVay said, this is a big hit for a team that believes it has the horses to make it to the Super Bowl. Though Reynolds is capable, and Woods is obviously a first-tier talent, Kupp had established himself as a real go-to guy for quarterback Jared Goff at all levels of the field.\n\nAmong receivers who have seen at least 20% of their offense\u2019s snaps this season, only Seattle\u2019s Tyler Lockett and Houston\u2019s Will Fuller (who\u2019s out for the rest of the season with his own injury) have allowed a better quarterback rating when targeted than Kupp\u2019s 145.9, per Pro Football Focus. And Kupp\u2019s 304 yards after catch this season has been exceeded by only five receivers\u2014Michael Thomas, Tyreek Hill, Albert Wilson, JuJu Smith-Schuster, and Antonio Brown.\n\nThe combination of efficiency and yards after catch may have you thinking that Kupp is a Wes Welker-style short-catch guy who runs around after easy targets. There\u2019s some element of that to his game, but in his second NFL season, Kupp has reminded me of Seattle\u2019s Doug Baldwin and New England\u2019s Julian Edelman\u2014top-level receivers who win at all levels with athleticism and route awareness, as well as a next-level understanding of how to leverage defenders into positive gains.\n\nThis 25-yard reception against Seattle last Sunday shows how well Kupp works in McVay\u2019s multiple passing concepts. Here, the Rams are running a three-level route concept to the left side, with Woods (No. 17) running a vertical route, Kupp (No. 18) running an intermediate out-and-up, and tight end Tyler Higbee (No. 89) taking the underneath with a wheel route. Seattle won\u2019t be able to answer for all of this with their spot-drop defense, and Kupp maneuvers through that defense masterfully, scooting past cornerback Justin Coleman (No. 28) for the pitch-and-catch.\n\nAnd like both Baldwin and Edelman, Kupp has a great feel for when to break the stem of his route to exploit a cornerback. Here, he\u2019s beating Saints cornerback Eli Apple (No. 25). It appears that Apple is expecting Kupp to run a corner route to the boundary, because he turns his back as Kupp keeps running up the seam. And then, when Apple does square up, Kupp does a brilliant job of tailing his route around the defender, giving Goff another clean read.\n\nKupp has also learned to take advantage of holes in short and intermediate coverage at a level few receivers can match. Check out this 41-yard touchdown against the Saints. Kupp is running pre-snap motion from left to right, and when Apple follows him, he knows that the Saints are playing man coverage underneath. Out of the right-side H-back position, Kupp runs a mesh pick with Woods, leaving Apple in the dust. By the time Kupp makes the catch, he has five yards of clearance from his defender, created by both scheme and player awareness.\n\nSimilarly, this 70-yard touchdown against the Vikings in Week 4 came about because Kupp worked perfectly within the passing concept and understood how to sell one type of route while running another. Here, Kupp appears at first to run a short-level crossing route, but takes it up the field against linebacker Anthony Barr (No. 55). Barr has no answer for Kupp\u2019s speed when he does head up the numbers, and this is another easy play.\n\nEase. Open reads. Leverage. Understanding. There are all kinds of talented receivers in the NFL, but there are a handful who take it to the next level for their quarterbacks by running consistently superior routes and affecting defenses with subtle sleight-of-hand. Cooper Kupp is just such a player, and though the Rams have the talent to replace him pretty well on the roster, it\u2019ll be a different story on the field.", "", "Week 11 of college football is in the books, and the four front-runners for the College Football Playoff did exactly what they were supposed to do given their opponents and the momentum wave they\u2019re riding into the final weeks of the season.\n\nNo. 1 Alabama shut out No. 16 Mississippi State, No. 2 Clemson beat No. 17 Boston College by nearly three touchdowns, No. 3 Notre Dame crushed Florida State, as did No. 4 Michigan on the road at Rutgers. But while this week\u2019s results mean they\u2019re still the top-4 teams in both the AP and coaches polls, their chances of making the playoff still changed slightly, according to ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor.\n\nThe difference? Clemson and Notre Dame\u2019s chances got a small bump, Alabama\u2019s chance stayed the same but Michigan\u2019s dipped a little. Beyond the top four, the remaining four teams with a reasonable shot at the playoff are Georgia and Oklahoma \u2014 which saw their chances tumble \u2014 and rising Ohio State and West Virginia teams.\n\nSo far this season, we\u2019ve listed the top four teams\u2019 chances at the playoff, advancing to the title game and winning the championship. But because we\u2019re down to the final weeks and have a clear group with reasonable paths to the playoff, here\u2019s the full breakdown for the top eight, according to ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor.\n\n1. Clemson (10-0)\n\nPlayoff: 95 percent\n\nChampionship game: 64 percent\n\nWin championship: 35 percent\n\n2. Alabama (10-0)\n\nPlayoff: 86 percent\n\nChampionship game: 62 percent\n\nWin championship: 38 percent\n\n3. Notre Dame (10-0)\n\nPlayoff: 77 percent\n\nChampionship game: 21 percent\n\nWin championship: 6 percent\n\n4. Michigan (9-1)\n\nPlayoff: 45 percent\n\nChampionship game: 17 percent\n\nWin championship: 7 percent\n\n5. Georgia (9-1)\n\nPlayoff: 37 percent\n\nChampionship game: 18 percent\n\nWin championship: 8 percent\n\n6. Oklahoma (9-1)\n\nPlayoff: 25 percent\n\nChampionship game: 9 percent\n\nWin championship: 3 percent\n\n7. Ohio State (9-1)\n\nPlayoff: 22 percent\n\nChampionship game: 6 percent\n\nWin championship: 2 percent\n\n8. West Virginia (9-1)\n\nPlayoff: 10 percent\n\nChampionship game: 2 percent\n\nWin championship: Less than 1 percent\n\nWith Clemson\u2019s, Alabama\u2019s and Notre Dame\u2019s numbers staying the same compared with last week or increasing slightly, it just reinforces everyone\u2019s thought that if these teams win out \u2014 including conference championship games for the Tigers and Crimson Tide \u2014 they\u2019re in. Same goes for Michigan, even though its numbers dropped a tad.\n\nSpeculating, if Alabama is shockingly a one-loss team after the SEC championship game against Georgia, it will still probably make the playoff in a similar situation to last year\u2019s final four.\n\nAfter Week 10, Clemson\u2019s playoff chance was at 92 percent, while Alabama\u2019s was 86 percent and Notre Dame\u2019s was 73 percent. However, this week as in the past, even though the Tigers have the best overall shot at the playoff, the Crimson Tide is still the most likely team to win the national championship with that figure up from 36 percent last week.\n\nWhat is somewhat surprising is that despite extending its win streak to nine games, Michigan\u2019s playoff chances dropped from 50 percent last week, as did its likelihood of advancing to the championship (20 percent last week) and winning a title (eight percent last week).\n\nPossible reasons for that could be Ohio State remaining in contention to be the Big Ten East\u2019s representative in the conference title game, and it seems like this will come down to their Week 13 matchup in Columbus. It\u2019s also possible the formula factored in Big Ten West champ Northwestern, should Michigan get to the Big Ten title game, because the Wolverines only beat the Wildcats, 20-17, thanks to a touchdown with about four minutes left in the game.\n\nThe Buckeyes \u2014 who beat Michigan State on Saturday \u2014 saw their playoff chances get a six percent boost compared with last week, but they remain in the No. 7 spot on the Playoff Predictor list. After their chances plummeted following their 29-point loss to Purdue a few weeks ago, they have no choice but to win out.\n\nShould the Big Ten champion have two losses \u2014 like if Michigan loses this week to Indiana but beats Ohio State and then Northwestern \u2014 that opens the door for a one-loss Big 12 champion to slide into the playoff. But if Oklahoma and West Virginia end up playing in Big 12 title game the week after their regular season finale, and they each win once, they\u2019ll likely shut the conference out. If both the Big Ten and Big 12 end up with two-loss champions, the edge probably goes to the Big Ten.\n\nCompared with last week, Oklahoma\u2019s playoff chance is down from 34 percent while West Virginia\u2019s is up from just five percent. However, they stayed at Nos. 6 and 8, respectively. But even if, for example, the Sooners beat the Mountaineers in back-to-back weekends, they still need the Big Ten to implode to have a shot at competing for a national championship.\n\nAlthough Georgia\u2019s playoff chance dropped from 40 percent last week continuing on a downward trend, it\u2019s still No. 5 on the Playoff Predictor list. Likely the only way the Bulldogs are in the playoff is if they upset Alabama in the SEC championship game. That would force the committee\u2019s hand to have two one-loss SEC teams in the playoff, which could end up shutting out the Big Ten altogether, depending on how Clemson and Notre Dame finish too. However, that upset for Georgia is far easier said than done.\n\nESPN Analytics\u2019 algorithm is based on a team\u2019s strength of record, losses, conference championships, independent status (because of Notre Dame) and the Football Power Index (FPI) \u2014 which gauges how well teams are playing based on expectations, or, basically how good each team is. It also considers how the selection committee has acted in the last four years when faced with similar predicaments.\n\nSee the top 25 teams in ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor list here.\n\nRead more about ESPN\u2019s Playoff Predictor from the preseason and after Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, Week 6, Week 7, Week 8, Week 9 and Week 10 on FTW.", "Jennifer Garner called 'fun-killing' mom in daughter's note.

But, it also could be a giant headache. USA TODAY\n\nAmazon went searching for another headquarters. (Photo: Jordan Stead, Amazon)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Amazon named New York City and the Washington suburb of Arlington, Va., as the areas that will divvy up 50,000 high-paying jobs the online retail giant is likely to bring.\n\nThe announcement Tuesday came after 24 months of intense jockeying by more than 230 cities vying to become the home of Amazon's second headquarters.\n\nAmazon chose two areas that have long been front-runners among the 20 finalists announced Jan. 18.\n\nAmazon\u2019s request for proposals listed multiple requirements, including tax incentives and a business-friendly environment. The Seattle-based company aims to hire the best and the brightest talent to keep up its ferocious pace of innovation, even as other tech companies compete to hire those same workers.\n\nNew York City and the greater D.C. area fit that bill admirably, said Jeffrey Shulman, a professor at the University of Washington\u2019s school of business who studies Amazon\u2019s effect on Seattle.\n\nMore: Amazon HQ2 timeline: The winners are New York City and Arlington, Va.\n\n\u201cBoth of those cities are attractive places to live where they have both a talent pool and the cultural amenities that make someone willing to uproot their lives and move there,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who want to work at Amazon will now have three cities to choose from rather than one or two.\u201d\n\nD.C. the front-runner\n\nThe Washington metro area landed three spots among the 20 finalists when the company narrowed its list of candidate sites in January: Montgomery County, Maryland; Northern Virginia (Loudoun County and Fairfax County); and Washington itself.\n\nThat resulted in nine proposed building sites within a 28-mile radius of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAs the seat of the nation\u2019s government, Washington stood out among the potential sites. The area\u2019s public transportation system and its white-collar, well-educated workforce are strengths. Its location in the Eastern Time Zone makes it good for staying in touch with subsidiaries across the Atlantic. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, purchased a $23 million mansion in the area, the largest private residence in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cThen you put Bezos having a house here and owning The Post and increasingly needing to influence federal policy, this isn\u2019t a bad place to be,\u201d said economist Stephen Fuller, a professor of public policy and regional development and director of the Fuller Institute at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nNorthern Virginia stood out as the prime choice in the region for its tech-centric surroundings. A crossroads of the internet, the region has many data centers where tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Salesforce connect. Amazon Web Services has 29 individual data centers in Northern Virginia. According to Loudoun County, where most of the data centers are, 70 percent of global internet traffic flows through it.\n\nThe case for New York\n\nProbably highest on Amazon\u2019s list of must-haves is access to tech and other talent. The New York Metro area has almost 1.3 million workers in the relevant fields of management, business, finance, math, public relations and sales.\n\nNew York is a magnet for young professionals, who prize urban areas, rich culture and vibrant art scenes. It has a massive, if somewhat beleaguered, transit system.\n\nIt's a large enough city that adding 25,000 highly paid workers won't seriously distort the job market in the ways it might have in smaller cities such as Raleigh, North Carolina, or Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThough housing in New York City is tight, Long Island City at the western edge of the borough of Queens has been on an apartment building spree. A total of 41 apartment buildings have been built in the area over the past eight years, with 12,533 apartments by 2017, according to RentCafe.\n\nThe search process\n\nThe search began Sept. 7, 2017, when Amazon announced it was looking for a second headquarters, one that would be co-equal to its Seattle home. It posted a request for proposals outlining what information and attributes it looked for.\n\nSuch an open process for an economic development proposal is rare. These searches are usually done in secrecy and announced only after a site has been chosen. Amazon instead made its requirements public and let the offers roll in.\n\nThe prospect of investment and bragging rights from securing the world's most valuable company pitted tiny cities against metropolises, each striving to convince the Seattle company it had the right workers, transportation, culture and tax breaks. It was an effort built for the age of social media, when everything takes place in public and there is constant jockeying for top billing.\n\nIn the end, 238 cities sent in proposals by the deadline of Oct. 19, 2017.\n\nMore: An Amazon HQ2 timeline\n\nOn Jan. 18, a short list of 20 finalists was announced. The cities and areas were Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Boston; Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Denver; Indianapolis; Los Angeles; Miami; Montgomery County, Maryland; Nashville, Tennessee; Newark, New Jersey; New York City; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, North Carolina; Toronto; and Washington.\n\nA team from the company visited each of the finalists in the spring and summer, then spent the next months crunching numbers and doing due-diligence checks in a tightly controlled process.\n\nThough all 20 cities were eager for the jobs and investment the headquarters will bring, detractors argued cities offered enormous tax credits and other incentives to entice Amazon with little proof that the city would come out ahead. Some residents worried that the influx of highly paid tech workers would worsen commutes and drive up steep housing prices.\n\nAlmost none of the finalist cities told the public \u2013 or even their city councils \u2013 the dollar amounts. This is legal because most of the deals were put together by local development agencies.\n\nMore: Amazon second headquarters search has become a cultural meme, a year after it began\n\nMore: An Amazon HQ2 timeline\n\nNot here, please\n\nThe search sparked several campaigns, some national and some local, urging Amazon not to locate in a given area.\n\nAt a national level, gay rights advocates ran a \"No Gay? No Way!\" campaign to pressure Amazon to avoid building its second headquarters in a state that does not protect its residents from discrimination for their sexual orientation or gender identity. It called out nine finalist cities in states that lack anti-gay-discrimination laws: Austin, Dallas, Nashville, Atlanta, Columbus, Indianapolis, Miami, Raleigh and Arlington.\n\nSmaller groups urged Amazon to stay out of their cities because they didn\u2019t want the negatives placement was likely to bring: higher housing costs due to an influx of well-paid workers, gentrification and more traffic.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe winners can expect a few things to happen right away. First, big parties held by city officials. Then a land rush.\n\nAmazon staff won't start showing up for months, if not years, but speculators, developers and those expecting to ride a significant rise in housing prices in both areas will arrive quickly. This is likely to be more pronounced in Northern Virginia simply because its real estate market isn't as white-hot as New York's is.\n\nLook for the biggest interest in cities rather than suburbs and along mass-transit routes. Amazon employees tend to be more attracted to urban areas and aren't typical commuters.\n\nAmazon estimates more than 20 percent of its Seattle employees ride public transit, and fewer than half drive alone to its campuses between Lake Union and downtown. That compares with 5 percent of workers nationwide, according to the American Public Transportation Association.\n\nMore: Amazon is no longer a Seattle company. Here's what that will mean for future workers and its second headquarters\n\nMore: Gay rights groups say Amazon should avoid these 9 cities for second headquarters\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/11/13/amazon-hq-2-goes-new-york-city-arlington-virginia-crystal-city/1263907002/", "Doctors Without Borders is saving lives in a country with one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.\n\nA pediatric nurse examines a newborn in the neonatal ward. (Photo: Andrea Bruce, Andrea Bruce/Noor Images)\n\nIn Khost, Afghanistan, what should be an exciting time for women can in reality be the most dangerous.\n\nNestled in a valley on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, Khost maintains a temperate climate that is contrasted by a harsh history of occupation and conflict \u2014 an ongoing reality for those that live there. The resulting instability has contributed to a lack of proper medical care and consequentially, some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world.\n\nSource: Doctors Without Borders (Photo: USATNetwork)\n\nThe statistics are staggering: About 4,300 Afghan mothers die in childbirth every year, two-thirds of babies are born without a skilled attendant present, and 40% of mothers receive no prenatal care at all. [1]\n\nClick here to find out how you can help.\n\nWith few options or resources available, many mothers choose to give birth at home, sometimes hours away from medical assistance.\n\n\u201cOnce an emergency situation is recognized and voiced, women may then need to travel long distances on dangerous roads to obtain the urgent care they need,\u201d said Heather Gottlieb, an OBGYN recently stationed in Khost with Doctors Without Borders. \u201cIt is thus not surprising that Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for a woman to give birth.\u201d [2]\n\n\u201cThere [are] an estimated 396 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in Afghanistan,\u201d Gottlieb, originally from Quebec, continued. \u201cBy contrast, in Canada there are only 7 [maternal deaths] per 100,000 live births.\u201d\n\nSleiman Ammar, a Lebanese doctor who spent six months with Doctors Without Borders in Kabul, witnessed similar challenges. \u201cWith each woman giving birth to an average of 6.6 babies, the risks associated with not having access to health care are enormous,\u201d Ammar said. [3]\n\nDoctors Without Borders opened a maternity hospital in Khost to address the lack of obstetric care in the area. (Photo: Kate Stegeman, Kate Stegeman/MSF)\n\nMen and women like Ammar and Gottlieb are influencing change, and thousands of families are experiencing the benefits. Convenient and free care for mothers and their newborns can be the difference between life and death \u2014 a difference that Doctors Without Borders is committed to providing.\n\nIn 2012, Doctors Without Borders opened a maternity hospital in Khost, and in 2016 began supporting three health centers in outlying districts. In Kabul and Khost, specialists focusing on maternal and neonatal health are working to reduce mortality and morbidity for mothers and infants alike. The international NGO has been providing free, high-quality healthcare since 2002. [4]\n\nBirths at the maternity hospital in Khost are increasing every year. (Photo: USATNetwork)\n\nDoctors Without Borders brings medical experts from across the world together to provide safe havens where women can give birth, lowering their chances of miscarriage or death. In the Khost maternity hospital alone, the number of deliveries increased by 40% in two years. Last December, deliveries reached 1,905, an average of over 60 per day. Some days there are close to a hundred births, said Gottlieb, and \u201cthe numbers continue to grow.\u201d\n\nMore births in maternity wards mean fewer unsupervised births at home, and safer birth experiences for mothers and their newborns. It's a dramatic improvement, but challenges remain. Safety in a warzone is no guarantee: A Doctors Without Borders trauma center in Kunduz was hit by an airstrike in 2015 and has yet to reopen, and an explosion in Doctors Without Border's Khost facility injured six in 2012. [5] These risks come on top of difficult and sometimes heart wrenching work, with high-risk labors occurring every day.\n\nSeverine Caluwaerts, an OBGYN from Belgium, recalled those she cared for in Khost, including a premature baby weighing under three pounds. \u201cHis mother is 17 years old and had high blood pressure with convulsions (eclampsia),\" she said. \u201cThis is something you hardly ever see back home in Belgium, but here we see an average of one per week.\u201d Patients with eclampsia are high-risk, as are premature babies, but both mother and child made it through. [6]\n\nDr Severine Caluwaerts talking with a patient in Khost maternity hospital. (Photo: Najiba Noori, Najiba Noori)\n\nCaluwaerts also witnessed the birth of quintuplets. \u201cWe see a lot of twins ... and triplets and [quadruplets, etc.],\" she explained, which is often a result of pressure on women by their families to get pregnant rapidly and repeatedly once married. With fertility pills readily available next-door in Pakistan, she said, the medicine is often taken \"without any medical guidance whatsoever.\u201d\n\nIn addition to expectations that women will stay at home, the burden of caring for large families has kept women from entering the workforce, and thus the medical field. This has contributed to a shortage that Doctors Without Borders is working to resolve by hiring and training local women.\n\nMedical professionals with Doctors Without Borders tend to newborn infants. (Photo: Doctors Without Borders)\n\n\u201cMore than 400 national Afghan staff, mostly women, are providing the high-quality maternity services at the Khost maternity hospital,\u201d said Gottlieb. This team and teams across Afghanistan helped deliver more than 70,000 babies in 2017 [7], a number that accounted for nearly one in four births assisted by Doctor Without Borders globally.\n\nAcross Afghanistan, these incredible teams of doctors, midwifes and nurses \u2014 a combined staff of over 2,220 \u2014 actively save mothers and babies from loss of life and one another. \u201cI realized how resilient the Afghan people truly are,\u201d Ammar said, reflecting on his time in Afghanistan. \u201cAfter so much suffering and many years of war, death is really a part of life and they have learnt to cope with loss.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of loss there is life to be gained. If there is anything more satisfying than delivering healthy infants into the arms of new mothers, it's sharing this feeling with others and sustaining it through hard work, community and growth. That\u2019s exactly what Doctors Without Borders continues to do, so that mothers can experience childbirth as it should be: a beginning and not an end.\n\nYour donation can help Doctors Without Borders save lives and continue this vital work.

And plaintiffs in several states have filed a separate class action alleging that e-cigarettes have caused nicotine addiction among consumers as young as 14.\n\nAnd at the federal level, the Food and Drug Administration is planning to announce stricter age-verification requirements for online sales of e-cigarettes this week. The FDA said it will also ban convenience store and gas station sales of sweet e-cigarette flavors.\n\nThe federal agency said in September it was giving the industry 60 days to submit plans to prevent youth vaping, or potentially see its product taken off the market.\n\nOfficials with Juul, the biggest e-cigarette seller, met recently with the FDA to discuss their marketing and age-verification protocols.\n\nThe company says it has worked with social media companies to remove more than 18,000 social media postings over the last six months that show their products being used in \"unauthorized and youth-oriented manners.\"\n\nJuul recently launched a secret shopper program that it says has visited 2,000 brick-and-mortar retailers to ensure that the product is not being sold to minors.\n\n\"Juul is intended for current adult smokers only,\" the company said in a statement. \"We cannot be more emphatic on this point: No young person or non-nicotine user should ever try Juul.

Jackson was fired by the Cleveland Browns last month after he won only three games in three seasons as head coach.\n\nAs soon as Cleveland let him go, the Bengals showed an interest in Jackson, who begins his third stint with them.\n\nIn his latest role, he'll help Lewis \u2014 a close friend \u2014 to try to fix the defense and save the season. Cincinnati (5-4) has lost three of its past four games and is on pace to give up the most yards in a season in NFL history. The Bengals have allowed 500 yards in three straight games, a first for any team in the Super Bowl era.\n\nThey fired defensive coordinator Teryl Austin on Monday, with Lewis taking over as defensive coordinator in addition to his head coaching duties. Lewis said on Monday that there was a plan to help him do both jobs, but didn't get specific.\n\nThe Bengals talked to Jackson about becoming Lewis' special assistant, and he readily accepted the position.\n\n\"I have a great comfort level with Hue and his ability to assist me with the day-to-day responsibilities on defense, including analyzing our opponents and helping me on game days with the players and defensive coaches,\" Lewis said.\n\nLewis hired Jackson in 2004 \u2014 his second season in Cincinnati \u2014 as receivers coach. He spent three years in the job before moving to the Falcons as offensive coordinator, developing a reputation for creativity. He was the Raiders' offensive coordinator before moving up to head coach in 2011.\n\nAfter his firing in Oakland, he returned to the Bengals in 2012 as a special assistant working with the defensive backs in 2012. He worked with the running backs in 2013 and was promoted to offensive coordinator a year later when Jay Gruden went to Washington.\n\nThe Bengals had one of their best years on offense in 2015, with Andy Dalton leading the AFC in passer rating. Jackson was hired by the Browns after the season\n\nBrowns owner Jimmy Haslam fired Jackson after a 33-18 loss in Pittsburgh, Cleveland's 25th consecutive road defeat. Jackson wasn't getting along with offensive coordinator Todd Haley, who also was fired.\n\nEven though Jackson will be working with the defense in his latest incarnation in Cincinnati, it'll create an awkward dynamic. Dalton developed a close relationship with Jackson, who helped him to his greatest success in the NFL. Bill Lazor is in his first full season as the Bengals' offensive coordinator.\n\nThe offense is missing receiver A.J. Green indefinitely with an injured toe on his right foot. The starting unit managed only one touchdown during a 51-14 loss to the Saints on Sunday at Paul Brown Stadium, even though New Orleans also has one of the league's worst defenses.\n\nThe Bengals play at Baltimore (4-5) on Sunday, a game that's pivotal for both teams. Pittsburgh (6-2-1) has started pulling away atop the AFC North. The Ravens have lost three straight games, and quarterback Joe Flacco has an injured hip that could keep him out of Sunday's game.\n\nCoach John Harbaugh said on Monday that he'll decide later in the week if Flacco can play. If not, rookie Lamar Jackson will likely get his first NFL start.\n\nThe Bengals haven't won a playoff game since the 1990 season, the sixth-longest streak of postseason futility in NFL history. Lewis is 0-7 in the playoffs, the worst coaching mark in league history.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Bush was declared the winner of Florida by 537 votes \u2013 giving him enough electoral votes to become the nation's 43rd president.\n\nThe following year, the Florida Legislature standardized its voting process by mandating that all 67 counties use optical scanning machines that provided a paper trail. No more hanging or dimpled or slightly perforated chads to decipher.\n\nThe law created early voting and made it easier for Floridians to vote by absentee ballot. Voters who made a mistake on their ballot through a technical flaw \u2013 such as voting for more than one candidate for the same office \u2013 were allowed to submit a corrected ballot on the spot. Recounts became automatic if the difference between two candidates was no more than half a percentage point.\n\nRepublican Rep.

But those same changes led to an increase in early voting and mail-in ballots that take a long time to verify, making it harder for Broward and Palm Beach to retabulate the votes.\n\nPosey said everybody knew what the rules were long before this election took place.\n\n\"Nobody in Baker County's having a problem. Pinellas County's not having problems. Orange County's not having problems. It's the same people having the problems,\" he said. \"You get bad actors, they can cause bad things to happen.\"\n\nFlorida elections had issues even before 2018 rolled around.\n\nIn 2011, Scott, as governor, signed a bill passed by the GOP Legislature that, among its changes, shortened early voting. The move disproportionately affected minority voters and was reversed after the 2012 election following sharp criticism from civil rights groups.\n\nAubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida, agrees with Posey that the state boasts one of the nation's most comprehensive election processes in the nation.\n\nBut it's not insulated from human error or the polarizing nature of Florida's evenly split electorate, which magnifies the impact of mistakes or confusion that would be surmountable in many other states, he said. Despite major strides since Bush v. Gore, Florida remains the bloodiest battleground heading into 2020, he said.\n\n\"After 18 years and a population growth of 5 to 6 million, we're still evenly divided, perhaps more evenly divided,\" Jewett said. \"That feeds into everything else: We're huge to presidential elections, to control of the Senate, to control of the House.

Now, the Colts are on a bit of a hot streak having won their past three games and sitting optimistically at 4-5. If both team\u2019s winning streaks hold, the Texans would be 9-3 and the Colts 7-5. A Houston loss in the next three games and Indianapolis continuing to rack up the W\u2019s would make that a compelling game to flex into. The current game in the time slot is Seattle-Minnesota.\n\nWeek 16 has the Texans traveling to take on the Philadelphia Eagles, who lost in Week 10 to the Dallas Cowboys to fall 4-5 on the season. The Eagles would have to be in the hunt for the NFC East title by that point, not in a tailspin from a Super Bowl hangover.

Buzz60's Elizabeth Keatinge has more. Buzz60\n\nA WOW Air Airbus A321neo is seen at the 2017 Paris Air Show. (Photo: Airbus)\n\nREYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) \u2014 For those hoping for ever cheaper fares on long-haul flights, this month's takeover of Icelandic airline Wow is not good news.\n\nThe struggling airline, which specializes in ultra-cheap flights between North America and Europe, was taken over by Iceland's flagship carrier, Icelandair, for just $18 million. Its rescue is a reality check for an industry hoping to apply the budget flying model to long-haul routes.\n\nAnd for now it means that passengers from, say, Washington will likely have to pay more than the $99 teaser rates previously offered for the six and half-hour trip to the Icelandic capital, which serves as a stopover to mainland Europe.\n\n\"It simply costs more than $99 to fly between continents and Wow air has not found ways around it,\" said Kristjan Sigurjonsson, editor of local travel news site Turisti.\n\nMore: WOW Air CEO: Strategy shift behind exit from three cities in U.S. Midwest\n\nRelated: Thanksgiving flying guide: 7 things to know\n\nWhile Wow will continue as a separate brand for now, Sigurjonsson says it's unclear whether Icelandair will have it continue offering such low fares in an attempt to compete with Norwegian Air, which is offering cheap flights at a loss to gain market share.\n\nBut for now, the numbers don't add up for budget long-haul flying.\n\nPart of the business model for low-cost flying across the Atlantic depends on getting cheaper airport slots, both by departing at odd hours and by flying to smaller cities in the United States. Wow flies to St Louis and Pittsburgh, for example. The low fares, in turn, mean planes are typically full.\n\nWow flies across the Atlantic with single-aisle, narrow-body Airbus A321 jets. Being smaller than a widebody plane makes them easier to fill, an important consideration in keeping down costs per seat. They are also cheaper than two-aisle planes. Wow's jets are relatively new, meaning they are more fuel-efficient than some competitors' fleets.\n\nHowever, those savings have been squeezed in the past couple years as oil prices have risen. The U.S. benchmark for oil has risen 50 percent from late 2016 to a peak of $75 in September this year, before easing back somewhat.\n\nFor a budget airline like Wow, where margins are already tight, that means a direct hit to earnings. On top of that, wages have been rising sharply in Iceland, where its employees are based.\n\nMore: Q&A: WOW Air CEO says new city coming next week; discusses dropped Midwest cities\n\nFounded in 2012, the airline expanded fast to 37 destinations and reported up to 60 percent annual growth in passenger numbers. Its revenue per passenger, however, has not kept up and fell by about 20 percent in 2017, according to the last earnings report.\n\nAbout 70 percent percent of Wow's passengers travel between Europe and North America. Combined with Icelandair, the airlines will carry about 3.8 percent of transatlantic passengers, according to analysts at Icelandair.\n\nExperts say that what budget airlines like Wow lack is the big source of money from transatlantic flying: business travelers. The New York-London route is the most lucrative in the world, thanks to the amount of business travelling done between the two financial hubs. British Airways takes in a reported $1 billion a year between those cities alone.\n\nBudget airlines have been trying to tap that market. Wow created a new business-class scheme and in a presentation to investors this year it predicted that would help it make a profit this quarter. Norwegian Air has also offered \"Premium class without the premium price,\" reportedly with modest success.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether companies booking trips will agree to pick budget airlines over established carriers that are often seen as more reliable because they have bigger fleets and deeper pockets.\n\n\"The established airlines have loyalty programs that hold tight to the most lucrative clients,\" said Skarphedinn Steinarsson, former CEO of low-cost carrier IcelandExpress and the director of the Icelandic Tourist Board. \"It takes longer to win this group over than the typical bargain-hunter.\"\n\nFor now, it is the flagship carrier coming out on top.\n\nWow founder and CEO Skuli Mogensen urged his staff Monday to \"look at this as an opportunity to continue our journey now as a part of a much stronger group\".\n\nThe charismatic boss, who has in the past mocked Icelandair as \"outdated\" and used his image to represent the airline, acknowledge defeat with much understatement: \"It was not part of the original game plan.\"\n\nMore: Europe's 30 biggest airlines: Which is No. 1?\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2018/11/13/fewer-cheap-fares-long-haul-flights-wow-air/1986023002/", "CLOSE Athletes in both the NBA and NHL are speaking out against gun violence following the recent mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California.

Are there any exceptions? \u2013 Anonymous\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr.: There are no hard-and-fast rules about removing internships, or any other jobs for that matter, from a resume. However, I can share some general guidelines.\n\nIf the internship took place 10 or more years ago, don\u2019t include it unless you gained knowledge and skills or completed assignments that would be interesting to a prospective employer. On the other hand, internships completed five years ago or less should probably remain on your resume.\n\nIf you worked as an intern between five and 10 years ago, use your best judgment. If you believe it will help you land your next job, include it.\n\nHowever, if you have a lot of experience and your internship doesn\u2019t correlate to the job you\u2019re applying for, leave it off. It could detract from your overall resume.\n\nThe exception is if you worked as an intern for a famous employer or in a niche field, like the sports industry. In those cases, I\u2019d suggest keeping an internship on your resume because the experience could help you stand out.\n\nAdditionally, internships can serve as supplemental experience if you do not meet the required years of experience for a desired job.\n\nLastly, if you have five or more years of professional experience, start focusing on gaining certifications in your industry or with your profession association. This will show a prospective employer you are continuing to grow in your career and not relying on early academic experience. Certifications also show you have the most current knowledge in your field.\n\nInternships are valuable in helping you to identify a career and prepare for it. But, as you gain professional work experience, they become less important. As a result, your resume will evolve over time.\n\nMore: Ask HR: How to fight workplace incivility over politics after the midterm elections\n\nMore: Ask HR: Some insights on the #MeToo movement and harassment in the workplace\n\nMore: Ask HR: What should I do if there's no HR?

Yet, when veterans transition from the military to the civilian workforce, they often struggle to find work.\n\nThis is often because both veterans and prospective employers don\u2019t see how military skills translate to the civilian workplace.\n\nIn speaking with business leaders a few years ago, former President George W. Bush illustrated the problem with a story about an ex-sniper seeking a new career. Without looking more deeply, an employer might dismiss a job application from such a veteran. But, President Bush suggested, the veteran could emphasize some of his proven skills like remaining calm under pressure and being a team player and loyal employee \u2013 all attractive traits in any workplace.\n\nMilitary veterans often have advanced technical training, team-building experience, organizational commitment and the ability to adapt in times of change. Many also have transferable certifications and licenses that employers value.\n\nIt is HR\u2019s responsibility \u2013 and honor \u2013 to help employers incorporate veterans into hiring. This starts with recognizing the unique perspectives and talents veterans bring to the workplace.\n\nDoing so helps employers make strides toward fixing the skills gap, filling jobs in a tight labor market and employing a diverse group of people who bring unparalleled experience to the workplace.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/2018/11/13/resume-tips-heres-when-you-should-take-past-internships-off-list/1944116002/", "", "While many people are calling for Todd Bowles\u2019 head following a 41-10 loss to the Bills, former Jet Damien Woody chose to blame the players for their despicable performance on Sunday.\n\nWoody made an appearance on ESPN\u2019s First Take Monday morning and didn\u2019t attack Bowles for the way the team played on Sunday.

After finishing last in goals-against last season (3.57 goals per game), the Islanders are fifth this season (2.56).\n\n\u201c(Many) said this team couldn\u2019t compete if they didn\u2019t keep Tavares,\u201d Trotz recalled.\n\nUnder Trotz\u2019s command, the Islanders are proving it's not true.\n\n\u201cI know it can be a fairly quick fix if you get your culture and your structure and the right people in the right seats,\u201d Trotz said.\n\nEven without Tavares, who signed a seven-year deal with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the Islanders are scoring three goals per game.\n\nMore: Here's why the NHL concussion settlement didn't come close to the NFL's\n\nMore: Five things to know in the NHL: Penguins sure to trade to shake things up\n\n\u201cThe thing is trying to create an Islander identity,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cWhat does that entail? Maybe it\u2019s more of a team game, a little more structure.\u201d\n\nWhat defines Trotz as a coach is an ability to persuade or will players to take their games to the next level. When Trotz took over the expansion Nashville Predators in 1998-99, he quickly made them competitive.\n\nHe was brought into Washington in 2014-15 to show the Capitals how they needed to play for postseason success. The mission was accomplished.\n\nNow he is trying to restructure an Islanders team that played last season as if players believed they could win every game 6-5.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of challenge that Trotz enjoys. He had options. He could have sat all summer and waited to see what unfolded this season. He could have ended up in Los Angeles or Chicago this fall. Some teams might have fired their coach for a shot at Trotz.\n\nBut one appeal of the Islanders job is that Lou Lamoriello is now the team\u2019s general manager. Trotz worked for David Poile in Nashville and respected him greatly. They became friends. Lamoriello and Poile have similarities.\n\n\u201cI know Lou doesn\u2019t stand for losing,\u201d Trotz said.\n\nTrotz saw a team that needed to be better defensively and in net.\n\n\u201cI know the part of keeping the puck out,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cThat is fixable. The mental part, culture, those are things that take you a little bit longer.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, Trotz had an objective to get veteran star Alex Ovechkin to add more defensive responsibility to his game. With the Islanders, it's critical young star Mathew Barzal plays Trotz\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cOvi was an old dog I had to teach new things and Barzal is a young puppy that hopefully you get to train,\u201d Trotz said.\n\nYoung or old, players believe in Trotz\u2019s methods. The Capitals, particularly Ovechkin, respected Trotz. The feeling was mutual. He admired his players for overcoming their poor postseason history.\n\n\u201cThey had a lot of scars,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tension in Washington that was undeniable. I could write my name in the air there. So those players felt it.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals had reached the playoffs in 10 of 11 seasons but never advanced past the second round. \u201cThey checked every box and got rid of the demons,\u201d Trotz said.\n\nIt was bothersome to him that there were no goodbyes to players and folks in the organization. He will get another chance on Nov. 26 when the Islanders play the Capitals for the first time since he left. It will be an emotional game.\n\n\u201cGood memories,\u201d said Trotz, who will visit Washington for the first time since his departure Jan. 18. \u201cI\u2019ve texted with a couple of guys. But I think players know what I think of them as people and what we did together. There will always be relationships there.\u201d", "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a voluntary nationwide recall by Sandoz Inc. of losartan potassium hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

This, and his father's love of baseball, inspired him to create a hand-crafted bat company. Camille Fine, USA TODAY\n\nJuan Baret, 39, poses for a portrait in his Woodbridge, Virginia, home on July 17, 2018.

His bat making business is his side hustle and is ran out of his garage, where he creates each bat himself. (Photo: Camille Fine, USAT)\n\nAir Force veteran Juan Baret has loved baseball ever since he was a 9-year-old Bronx kid eagerly waiting at the gate of Yankee Stadium, hoping to get in. Years of chronic pain have left him unable to play, but he\u2019s found a way to stay in the game \u2013 as a maker of custom wooden bats.\n\nIn February 2013, Baret created his first product in the garage of his Woodbridge, Virginia, home. It was a Little League bat fit for a small child. He remembers his kids grabbing the bat and celebrating the accomplishment.\n\n\u201cEven though I was still in pain, it made me feel confident that this is probably something I should pursue,\u201d Baret says.\n\nThroughout his life, love of baseball has been a constant. And it might have been God that led him to the sport, Baret says.\n\nNow 39, Baret landed in the South Bronx in 1988 after migrating from the Dominican Republic. On spring afternoons, after school let out, Baret walked \u201cby faith\u201d to Yankee Stadium. He had no money for game tickets, but he always felt strongly that he\u2019d get in.\n\nConsistently, strangers began approaching him with free tickets, not knowing he came from a low-income household. \u201cHey, here\u2019s a free ticket, kid. You can go to the game,\u201d they told him.\n\n\u201cPretty much, it happened every time I would go down there. I wouldn\u2019t even ask people,\u201d he says.\n\nBaret eventually picked up the bat himself.\n\nHis father was a volunteer coach and umpire for the Alfonso Little League team in Manhattan. They spent every day in the summer of 1990 playing baseball from sunup to sundown, practicing the fundamentals.\n\nThe next summer, Baret was ready to play. Baseball followed him through childhood, school and a military career. He enlisted in the Air Force in 1998 but left in 2007, three days shy of serving 9 years.\n\nThat same year, he stopped playing. Injuries he sustained during service had left him with severe pain in his hips, knees and back. It would be half a decade before he picked up a bat again, and he didn't last long.\n\nIn 2012, back pain forced him to leave his team in the middle of the season. But this time, he walked away with inspiration.\n\n\u201cOne positive thing out of playing baseball that year was that I was using wood bats,\u201d Baret says. He recalls a day in his last season when his bat broke after a hit. He took it home, put it back together with glue, then used it in his final game.\n\nHe got in two good hits \u2013 and that\u2019s when the idea for a business clicked. By early 2013, Baret Bats was up and running.\n\nBaret makes each customized wood bat in his garage using a wood lathe, a machine that rotates small wooden cylinders against carving tools. Once a customer selects a bat type, Baret shapes the raw wood to the desired weight and size and finishes the bat with a custom paint job, personalized decal letters and a clear coat.\n\nA wooden bat made by hand, the old-fashioned way, ties the owner to the same type of equipment that Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and other legendary players used, Baret says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually giving them an opportunity to connect with the game, you know, using the same bat players from yesteryear used,\u201d Baret says.\n\nMore: Picture your small business on Instagram: Here are some best practices\n\nMore: Ben's Chili Bowl at 60: Community, commitment the secret ingredients of success\n\nMore: How can small business owners win the holiday season? By playing Steph Curry's niche game\n\nAs the brand expands, Baret hopes to purchase an automatic bat-making machine. Right now, among other challenges of owning a start-up business, he lacks the space. And though he is able to control the quality and the process himself, he also loses time.\n\n\u201cMy output is not as much as it could be if I had a team of other people helping,\u201d Baret says.\n\nOn average, he is able to make two to three bats a week after working full-time as an office engineer for a military construction agency and caring for his three children \u2013 Alexis, 7; Alexandra, 6; and Gabriel, 5 \u2013 and wife, Darianella, 31. Baret\u2019s youth bats range from $60 to $80 dollars, and his adult bats cost $80 to $200, not that much more than mass-produced bats and including custom work.\n\nBaret is devoted to providing exceptional customer service. He believes \u201cit\u2019s all about relationships\u201d and often forms great bonds with customers during the production process, as each bat is personalized for the size and weight of the player.\n\nCustom bats from Baret Bats on top of a table in Juan Baret's Woodbridge, Virginia, home.

(Photo: Camille Fine, USA TODAY)\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019re solving a problem for the customer. If you could go above and beyond, and it fits within your means, then why not?\u201d Baret says.\n\nIn 2015, Baret crafted a bat in honor of fallen Army Specialist Sean Cutsforth, who was killed by small-arms fire in Afghanistan. Cutsforth\u2019s cousin, Andrew Widiker, 21, of Northern Wisconsin, ordered the bat to honor his life and time as a baseball player. According to Widiker, Cutsforth put the sport on the back burner in college to serve in the military.\n\nThe top half of the bat was painted blue, the bottom half red with seven white stars trailing toward the handle to represent the core Army values: loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage. At the very top of the barrel were the words, \u201cSWINGING FOR SEAN.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Widiker used his custom-made bat throughout his final baseball season in high school. He knew that\u2019s what Cutsforth would\u2019ve wanted him to do.\n\n\u201cThe moment I was up to bat, it was just amazing. I felt him there with me,\u201d Widiker says.\n\nJuan Baret, 39, is a disabled Air Force veteran who founded a baseball bat making business in his Woodbridge, Virginia, home after his injuries took him out of the game.

(Photo: Camille Fine, USA TODAY)\n\nIt took Baret a month and a lot of deep thought to create Widiker's bat. Then Baret got his biggest break: An entire Pennsylvania little league team purchased 16 bats from his website. He\u2019d never received that much demand at once.\n\nBaret\u2019s recent partnership with Competitive Edge athletic performance center also has gained his business more attention. More and more, the orders are rolling in.\n\nBaret\u2019s grand vision is for his company to be one of the top Major League Baseball (MLB) suppliers. He also wants to spread a personal message to the world that baseball gives people hope and that it has the power to change lives.\n\n\u201cBaseball has changed my life for the better. If I can do that for someone else, then I\u2019m doing my mission in life,\u201d he says.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2018/11/13/baret-baseball-bats-veteran-small-business/798476002/", "", "", "CLOSE After days of burning, much of Paradise, California turned to ash and rubble. USA TODAY\n\nThe Woolsey Fire in Thousand Oaks, Calif., has destroyed almost 400 structures. (Photo: Geospatial Intelligence Center)\n\nPARADISE, Calif. \u2013 Thousands of wildfire-weary Californians face financially and emotionally difficult years ahead as they begin rebuilding their homes and communities destroyed by the rampaging flames.\n\nIn Northern California where the Camp Fire still burns, 6,543 homes have been destroyed, along with hundreds of businesses. Near Malibu, the Woolsey Fire has destroyed about 370 structures.\n\nMost evacuees have no idea how their homes fared because evacuation orders keep the public from the dangerous conditions caused by the Camp and Woolsey fires. Though a few people know \u2013 including actor Gerard Butler and singer Robin Thicke \u2013 most evacuees are stuck waiting for information, begging reporters for updates and trying to finagle their way past road closures.\n\nMatt McNeill, 53, knows his house is gone. It burned down in Paradise as he desperately fled in his car, scooping up neighbors on the way. He has homeowner\u2019s insurance but isn't sure he'll rebuild.\n\nA general contractor, McNeill has been building homes in Paradise since 1990. He faces the thought of returning to a community vastly different from the one he fled.\n\nThe commercial district lies in ruins, dozens of business and municipal facilities destroyed by the fire. Thousands of burned trees will have to be cut down for safety, changing how Paradise looks for years to come.\n\n\"Would you want to live in a war zone for a decade or more?\" McNeill said by text. \"But then, our kids grew up there \u2013 great, great memories, beautiful people. Not really sure where life is headed now. Have to really think about that one.\"\n\nAuthorities have not begun notifying McNeill's neighbors about how their homes fared, in part because firefighters are trying to control the Paradise and Woolsey fires. Sending in ground-based survey teams remains too dangerous.\n\nFrom thousands of feet in the sky, specialists working for the nation's insurance companies take photos that building inspectors, assessors and firefighters can use to help inform the public.\n\n\u201cUnderneath that smoke are people\u2019s lives that have come unraveled,\" said Jim Schweitzer, senior vice president and chief operating officer of the National Insurance Crime Bureau.\n\nThe bureau works with insurance companies across the country to fight insurance-related fraud and crime, including vehicle thefts, but also to combat disaster-related fraud. In some cases, unscrupulous contractors perform shoddy work or conspire to get insurance companies to pay for extra work not caused by a disaster, which can bring felony charges and void a homeowner's coverage.\n\nThe stakes are high in the fires, which threaten nearly 50,000 homes valued at about $18 billion, according to property data company CoreLogic. The value of the destroyed homes has not been compiled because authorities don\u2019t have a complete assessment of the damage.\n\nThe insurance bureau partnered with imaging company Vexcel Imaging to create the Geospatial Intelligence Center, a not-for-profit initiative of the bureau funded by a consortium of insurers. Technicians take high-resolution aerial imagery of disaster areas with $1.5 million Vexcel cameras shooting out the bottom of airplanes.\n\nA little more than a year old, the GIC's Colorado-based teams have deployed to numerous natural disasters across the country, most recently to the East Coast to image the damage left by Hurricanes Michael and Florence. They fly over the Paradise and Woolsey fires.\n\nThe GIC mission includes mapping virtually every home and building in the country, providing insurers with \"before\" photos to compare with post-disaster imagery.\n\nThe searchable database of photos is initially available only to first responders, recovery agencies and member insurers but will be made public shortly.\n\n\u201cLike it or not, it\u2019s a confirmation. That alone can go a long way to beginning the recovery process,\u201d Schweitzer said. \u201cThe uncertainty is gone, and you can move forward.\u201d\n\nIn addition to helping insurers fight fraud, the photos allow them to reach out directly to their policyholders to help them with temporary housing and living expenses even before victims have a chance to check on their homes in person, Schweitzer said.\n\nFor many people who lost their homes, the journey to recovery is just beginning. McNeill said he has been overwhelmed by the generosity of strangers, who gave his family clothes and even a bike for his grandson. His family is adjusting to the loss, he said: \"You think, 'I don't have that anymore.' (But it's) the little things that get you through.

His son's school burned down, their neighbors all lost their houses, and dozens of the people he served died in the fire.\n\nDisasters such as the Paradise and Woolsey fires inevitably change the face of a community for decades. Some evacuees will never return. Some homeowners will choose to rebuild elsewhere. Small businesses may go under, and employment may be hard to come by for the thousands of people whose cars were destroyed. Evans said he's committed to seeing it through.

USA TODAY\n\nDarlene Easley stands in front of the home she bought in August 2017. (Photo: Darlene Easley)\n\nDarlene Easley doubted she could ever buy another home.\n\nIn 2014, the 53-year-old African-American social worker lost her previous house to foreclosure after she went bankrupt over $245,000 in medical bills from her breast cancer treatment.\n\n\"I tried to hold onto the home, the car, but the bills kept piling up,\" says Easley, who also was raising her teenage daughter on her own at the time. \"I was paying what I could but everything spiraled out of control.\"\n\nFast forward to August 2017 when Easley closed on a three-bedroom ranch home in Canal Winchester, Ohio. It wasn't without work. She got on a budget, paid down debt, improved her credit score and compromised on location.\n\n\"The same house would have been probably $30,000 higher on the other side of town,\" she said. \"I had to go where ... my finances were.\"\n\nEasley's challenges echo what many minorities face as they chase the American Dream of owning a home. The past year was no exception, according to a survey of homebuyers from the National Association of Realtors.\n\nAll homebuyers faced a tough housing market as prices and interest rates rose and affordability declined. But larger shares of black and Hispanic buyers had to surmount other obstacles \u2013 such as lower incomes, more student debt and mortgage approval troubles \u2013 beyond what their white counterparts faced, according to the NAR data.\n\nMore Money: Stock market falls, weighed down by Apple, other big tech companies\n\nMore Money: Business spending growth is slowing. Is that a bad sign for the economy and jobs?\n\nMore Money: 31 cities adding the most jobs as the US economy grows\n\nThe result? Homeownership rates of black and Hispanic buyers remain far below that of non-Hispanic whites, with black homeownership suffering the most since the Great Recession. Over time, this hurts these groups\u2019 ability to build wealth that can be tapped later in life or passed down to the next generation.\n\n\u201cWhere you live determines where your children can go to school,\" said Lebaron Sims, senior research manager at Prosperity Now, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for low-income communities. \u201cHome equity can be leveraged as an asset to start a business, pay for private school or college. Without that asset to draw on leaves these households at a major disadvantage.\u201d\n\nThe homeownership rate for whites is 73.1 percent, or 2.4 percent below its 74.9-percent rate when the Great Recession began in December 2007, according to Census data. The Hispanic rate is 46.3 percent, or 4.5 percent lower than the 48.5-percent rate in 2007. The black homeownership rate is 41.7 percent, or 12.8 percent off its 47.7-percent rate at the start of the recession.\n\nWhat are the obstacles?\n\nThe disparity in the homeownership rates has been a longstanding problem, advocates say. \"What we see today is the result of historical policies over the past several decades,\" from redlining to the foreclosure crisis that disproportionately hit minorities due to predatory lending, said Jhumpa Bhattacharya, vice president of programs and strategy at Insight Center for Community Economic Development, a national research and economic justice organization in Oakland, California.\n\nThe NAR's data pinpoints which factors proved most challenging for buyers this year.\n\n\u2022 Income: The median income of black homebuyers was $82,140, or 10.5 percent lower than the median for white buyers at $91,820. The difference can make it harder to save for a down payment. For instance, Easley's annual salary was $51,000 and she relied on a down payment gift from her twin sister.\n\nHispanic buyers fared a bit better with incomes 4.5 percent lower than white buyers, according to the NAR. To compensate, black and Hispanic buyers purchased lower-priced homes.\n\nPart of the income discrepancy is because black and Hispanic buyers are more likely to be first-timer buyers, a group with statistically lower incomes, versus white homebuyers. But that alone misses a larger context. Minority buyers, especially blacks, were also hit harder by the Great Recession, hurting their earning power going forward.\n\n\u201cThe crisis did prove that black families are more vulnerable when it comes to downturns,\u201d said Alanna McCargo, vice president of housing finance policy at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that conducts economic and social policy research.\n\nThe unemployment rate for blacks soared to 16.8 percent following financial crisis, while the highest level for whites was 9.2 percent. The unemployment rate for Hispanics hit a high of 13 percent during the recession.\n\n\u2022 Student debt: Paying college loans is a big burden for homebuyers. It\u2019s harder to save for a down payment and can make qualifying for a mortgage more difficult. It can also delay a purchase as people pay down their debt. And it\u2019s an obstacle that\u2019s more common among black buyers.\n\nForty-three percent of black homebuyers had student debt, compared with only 25 percent for Hispanics and 23 percent for whites, according to the NAR. The median amount was $39,000, or 50 percent more than the median amount among whites, and 95 percent higher than the total debt for Hispanics.\n\n\u2022 Mortgage woes: Black and Hispanic buyers were also more likely to be rejected by a mortgage lender than white borrowers. Part of this reflects the disparity in credit scores among these groups. Larger portions of blacks and Latinos have low credit scores or no credit history at all versus whites.\n\n\u201cSome of the payment history that African-Americans have is not even considered by credit scores \u2013 like rent payment, cellphone and even payments to high-interest lenders,\u201d said Jeffrey Hicks, president of the National Association of Real Estate Brokers, an industry trade organization.\n\nEasley got a secured credit card for small expenses and made regular on-time payments to boost her credit score by about 40 points, said Dairrick Alexander, her Coldwell Banker real estate agent.\n\nAnother issue is the decline in home loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, used extensively by black and Hispanic communities. These government-backed loans require smaller down payments and have more lenient credit standards. But since 2010, the number of FHA loans originated by lenders, especially big banks, has fallen, disproportionately hurting these homebuyers.\n\nPotential solutions\n\nTo increase homeownership rates among minorities requires a multiprong strategy using short- and long-term solutions.\n\nOne possibility is offering ongoing financial counseling for new homeowners so they can weather tough economic times.\n\n\u2022 Bigger picture for credit: Lenders can also adopt alternative methods of evaluating creditworthiness besides just credit scores, to expand access to mortgages. But there must be consumer protections in place to keep lenders from targeting groups with high-cost, risky loans like in the run-up to the last housing crash.\n\n\u2022 Grant programs: There can also be better education about down payment assistance or grant programs that states, municipalities and nonprofits offer first-time homebuyers. \u201cMoney is left on the table every year because no one knows about these,\u201d said McCargo of the Urban Institute.\n\nBut historical issues such as discrimination and economic inequality can\u2019t be solved with simple fixes. Advocates say more capital must be invested in minority communities to counter the lingering effects of redlining and help create better paying jobs, schools and neighborhoods.\n\nProgress has started in Hispanic communities. The homeownership rate for Hispanics has recovered the most since its post-recession low among all groups.\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen across the board general improvements in Hispanic and Latino households: higher earnings, better financial stability, lower rates of underbanked and unbanked households, higher job quality metrics overall,\" Sims said. \"It has been the biggest surprise.\"\n\nCLOSE If you don\u2019t automatically think of a booming housing market when you think of Boise, Idaho, think again.

That's unsupported and unjust. There's no reason for him to recuse.\n\nActing United States Attorney General Matt Whitaker and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nSince Donald Trump fired Jeff Sessions and announced that Matthew Whitaker would assume leadership of the Justice Department as acting attorney general, Whitaker has faced a barrage of unjust criticism from the mainstream media, the left, and the Never-Trump right. The opposition stems not from principle but from ideology, and it is yet another front of the resistance.\n\nThe main complaint lodged against the acting attorney general is that Whitaker is a Trump loyalist: During his tenure as Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, Whitaker reportedly served as a \u201cbalm\u201d between the Justice Department and the president, acting as the president\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears\u201d within what Trump viewed \u201can enemy institution.\u201d\n\nThe loyalist charge, though, is purposefully vague. And critics are exploiting this ambiguity by portraying Trump\u2019s trust in Whitaker as nefarious. But there is nothing nefarious about the (acting) attorney general loyally serving the president of the United States \u2014 that is his job! It is only by suggesting that solidarity with Trump means obstructing justice that \u201cloyalist\u201d becomes a pejorative.\n\nWhitaker's loyalty is a welcome change\n\nThe irony here is rich. Whitaker is taken to task for being trustworthy, while critics ignore the real scandal \u2014 the disloyalty apparently pervasive in the Justice Department and elsewhere in the administration.\n\nThe proof came early: Within two weeks of Trump\u2019s inauguration, acting attorney general and Obama administration holdover Sally Yates directed Justice attorneys not to defend the president\u2019s travel ban, forcing Trump to fire her. Since then, congressional investigations, Freedom of Information Act requests and dedicated work by Sessions have exposed additional efforts by Justice and FBI career employees to undermine the president. And yet even after nearly two years of cleaning house, just two months ago a supposedly senior official in the Trump administration claimed anonymously in the New York Times that \u201cmany of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s opponents may cheer such insubordination, our country suffers when unelected and unknown bureaucrats seek to thwart the agenda of the man freely chosen by voters to serve as our president. Whitaker\u2019s fidelity to Trump may be striking in contrast to the status quo in the D.C. swamp, but it is most assuredly not a stain on the acting attorney general\u2019s credentials or character.\n\nMore: Matthew Whitaker is an excellent choice to lead Justice Department\n\nChristine Blasey Ford's changing Kavanaugh assault story leaves her short on credibility\n\nTrump didn't realize Sessions was helping him. Now he'll pay for that mistake.\n\nNor does Whitaker\u2019s loyalty to the president require him to recuse from overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Here, it is helpful to recall why former Attorney General Sessions recused from overseeing that investigation: It was not because of Sessions\u2019 solidarity with the president, but because during the 2016 campaign Sessions had spoken with Russian Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak. While Sessions was a sitting senator at the time and said there was nothing improper about his conversation, he nonetheless stepped back from the Mueller investigation and turned the reins over to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nCritics want Whitaker to leave the matter in Rosenstein\u2019s hands and recuse from any oversight of Mueller. There is no basis to demand this recusal. Unlike the situation with Sessions, there is no connection between Whitaker and Russia involving the 2016 campaign. And the few innocuous public comments Whitaker made concerning Mueller\u2019s investigation are insufficient to justify recusal.\n\nUnjust to say Whitaker will thwart Mueller\n\nYet Trump\u2019s opponents seek to crucify Whitaker for refusing to step aside, speculating that as acting attorney general he will improperly interfere with the Mueller investigation. While this charge is both unsupported and unjust, it provides a political win-win for the president\u2019s detractors. If the narrative builds and prompts Whitaker to recuse, Rosenstein remains in the oversight role. But the more likely scenario sees Whitaker as Mueller\u2019s superior, in which case the victory comes when nothing comes of the Russia investigation.\n\nIf the special counsel concludes that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election \u2014 as appears likely given the absence of any substantive charges of collusion in the last two years \u2014 Trump\u2019s exoneration will be proof to his detractors that Whitaker interfered in the investigation. The relentless attacks on Whitaker today are merely laying the groundwork for that eventuality. And if Whitaker\u2019s reputation must take a hit in the process, that\u2019s just how Washington operates.\n\nAt least that has been how Washington has operated. Trump is changing things by refusing to capitulate and by countering false charges. We saw that in the case of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. And in assessing the current attacks aimed at Whitaker, the public would be wise to remember that the charges leveled against Kavanaugh didn\u2019t hold up to scrutiny in the end. They won\u2019t where Whitaker is concerned either.\n\nMargot Cleveland is a lawyer and an adjunct instructor at the University of Notre Dame.

(Photo: Cliff Owen, AP)\n\n\"I want seven hearings a week, times 40 weeks.\"\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., my former boss, famously declared that in the days after Republicans won the House majority in 2010, as he prepared to become chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n\nInternally, it was a cringe-worthy moment.\n\nWhy? Because, we were unnecessarily setting up impossible-to-meet expectations for ourselves.\n\nThe combination of our own enthusiasm for finding ourselves in the majority, the news media hype (which we stoked) and the hyper politicization of just about everything during the campaign had created an environment in which the only way we could be successful was if we \"got the goods\" on our investigative targets right away. Anything short of immediate success would enable our detractors to claim that our lack of success was proof that we were all talk, that our investigations were nothing but political witch hunts and that there was no \"there\" there to discover.\n\nThis really was a case of us not knowing what we didn't know. In retrospect, we'd have been so much better off if we had just said nothing and let the process naturally take its course.\n\nLearn from Republicans, skip the bombast\n\nAs House Democrats find themselves in the same position we were in eight years ago, they would be wise to learn from our mistakes. On Monday, Axios reported that a \"senior Democratic source\" said the new majority was preparing a \"subpoena cannon\" to unleash on the Trump administration.\n\nOn one hand I chuckled, because this was the kind of rhetorical bombast I was very fond of using back in the day. On the other hand, I winced, because it usually set us up for failure.\n\nHere's the functioning reality about congressional investigations: When done right, they take time. The bulk of things Democrats want to investigate will not yield any immediate or tangible results. In fact, Democrats won't be issuing many subpoenas until at least February. The one exception may be to compel Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. Other than that, subpoenas are the last resort for congressional investigators, not the first.\n\nWhen House Democrats officially take the reins in January, they will spend the first few weeks organizing their committees. They will set up the subcommittee structure, seat new members, submit a budget blueprint for approval from the House Administration Committee, and complete the giant logistical task of hiring hundreds of people.\n\nMore: Trump's Saturday Night Massacre is underway, but Congress can prevent a constitutional crisis\n\nSessions firing marks end of Mueller deniability for Republicans. Which side are we on?\n\nLet Mueller finish Russia investigation, it's most consequential in 30 years: Thornburgh\n\nOnce they are organized, the oversight work begins. The first thing Democrats will do is send what is called a \"document request\" to the White House and any relevant departments and agencies for material they tried to get under Republican majority rule that was either rejected or completely ignored.\n\nThis is a voluntary request, not a subpoena. What happens next is up to the White House.\n\nThe Trump administration and specifically the new White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, will have to decide what their congressional oversight response strategy will be. There are only two options: appearance of cooperation or obstruction.\n\nBlatant obstruction forcing a showdown with Congress is the fastest mechanism to unleash a tsunami of subpoenas.\n\nAppearance of cooperation would slow the process down significantly. The White House would negotiate with congressional investigators and try to narrow the scope of the request. They'd make acts of good faith by voluntarily producing some documents and making some people available for transcribed interviews. This is a process that could take weeks all by itself.\n\nSubpoenas are last resort, not opening shot\n\nAt some point, committee investigators will either decide that their threshold for information has been met and close the investigation, or will make another voluntary request for additional information, witnesses and documents. We could go through another round of voluntarily compliance, or the administration can decide that it has cooperated enough and produce nothing. Then, and only then, should a congressional subpoena come into play \u2014 as a last resort.\n\nEffective congressional oversight should be conducted deliberately, methodically, patiently and free from artificial and self-imposed timelines or deadlines. By talking about the flurry of investigations and subpoenas they want to pursue, Democrats are falling into the Issa-trap instead of taking a smart, strategic step back. Ultimately, if done right, the results of the investigations will speak for themselves. Those results will have much more impact if they are presented without the partisan, political rhetorical preamble.\n\nCongressional Democrats would be wise to adopt the tone and tenor of Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the incoming chairman of the oversight committee. \"I\u2019m not going to be handing out subpoenas like somebody's handing out candy on Halloween,\" he told George Stephanopoulos on ABC This Week. \"I take subpoenas very seriously and I plan to, if I have to use them, they will be used in a very, in a methodical way, and it must be in the public interest (as a) method of last resort.\"\n\nWhen it comes to talking about subpoenas, Democrats need a little less T-shirt \"subpoena cannon\" fodder and a little more \"method of last resort.\"\n\nKurt Bardella, a member of USA TODAY\u2019s Board of Contributors, was a spokesperson and senior adviser for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee from 2009 to 2013.

Ben Watson did, back in 2009.\n\nWhen Watson, 37, scored against the Rams last Sunday, he let the world know he and his wife, Kristen, are expecting twins by stuffing the ball under the front of his jersey and holding up five fingers on one hand as he often does to honor his five children.\n\nThen he held up two more fingers on his other hand in honor of the twins on the way.\n\nNine years ago, Watson similarly stuffed the ball under his jersey after scoring as Kristen was close to full term with their first child, Grace. He was fined shortly thereafter for using the ball as a prop.\n\n\"So the cool thing is I will be able to say (to his twins) that, 'When I did it for Grace, I had to pay. When I did it for you all, the league had changed,'\" Watson said. \"What a difference nine years make.\"\n\nNot for everyone.\n\nHill was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct in Kansas City for taking over the TV camera, just as Thomas was for pulling a flip phone out from under the goal post padding after his fourth-quarter score against L.A.\n\n\"Where did he get a flip phone?\" Watson said. \"I said (to Thomas), 'Do you even know who Joe Horn is? You must have been in elementary school back then.' But that was pretty good. I've got to give him props on that one.\"\n\nNo pun intended, of course.\n\nByard said Friday his $10,026 fine was worth it because his interception denied the Cowboys a touchdown and sparked a 28-7 run in Tennessee's 28-14 win in Dallas on Monday night.\n\nByard said he expected the Cowboys to take offense when he sprinted to the 50-yard line to pose on the star, then began a sort of Irish jig when teammates joined him at midfield.\n\n\"I was actually expecting someone to knock my head off,\" Byard said. \"I was like, if we get enough guys to the 50, we are just going to start dancing on the star.\"\n\nCowboys running back Byron Jones quickly shoved Byard away, playing the part of George Teague, who blasted Owens when he did the same thing while with the 49ers 18 years ago.\n\n\"You don't do that,\" Jones said.\n\nByard met with his coach, Mike Vrabel, who had a big problem with his DB's actions.\n\nVrabel said he wants players to celebrate with each other and not stand up an opponent.\n\n\"It's not what we want to do,\" Vrabel said.\n\nByard said his over-the-top celebrations are history.\n\nOther takeaways from Week 10 included a stumbling, bumbling Tom Brady, a shoutout from the Rams to Halle Berry and Sean McVay's decision to train at altitude in preparation for Monday night's showdown between the Rams and Chiefs, who are both 9-1.\n\nALTITUDE ACCLIMATION: Last year, Bill Belichick decided to stay in Colorado after a win at Denver to acclimate to the altitude of Mexico City's Azteca Stadium (elevation 7,200 feet) by practicing at the Air Force Academy (6,621 feet).\n\nIt paid off in a 31-8 drubbing of the Oakland Raiders, who stayed home and prepped at sea level.\n\nMcVay said the trade-off is scrubbing the team's routine, but the wildfires and mass shooting in Thousand Oaks has made training in Southern California anything but normal anyway.\n\nThe Rams will train in the Rocky Mountains on Thursday through Saturday before flying to Mexico, and McVay said a second charter with family members will fly out from L.A. to Colorado later in the week.\n\n\"I think it really served us well last year when we went to Jacksonville before we played in London,\" McVay said. \"Staying out there, kind of a way to connect with the team. Getting away a little bit. This instance definitely provides a little bit different approach where your families are so important right now.\"\n\nHAIL HALLE : Jarod Goff was glad it was quiet enough for fans to hear his \"Halle Berry\" play call Sunday. Even the actress heard it, tweeting him for an explanation.\n\nGoff couldn't reveal secrets of the audible, which resulted in an 8-yard pass to tight end Tyler Higbee.\n\nAll he'd tweet back was, \"It's my favorite play ever.\"\n\nOn Monday, McVay said, \"It's one of my favorite plays, too, Halle.\"\n\nBRADY'S BUNGLE : A lot is made of Brady's arm at age 41 and how he was just 21 of 41 Sunday in a 34-10 loss at Tennessee, where he was held without a TD pass for the second time in three weeks.\n\nBut what about his stumble and tumble on a trick play in which he caught the pass only to trip over himself and plop down a yard short of the first-down marker?\n\nTennessee QB Marcus Mariota later caught a pass on the Titans' own trick play.\n\n\"I wanted to see if ours looked any better than theirs,\" deadpanned Vrabel.\n\n___\n\nWith contributions from Associated Press Writer Terry McCormick.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nLast Tuesday was Election Day. Today will be Decision Day 2018 for Le'Veon Bell.\n\nThe all-pro running back must decide by 4 p.m. ET whether to report to the Pittsburgh Steelers and sign his franchise tag. If Bell shows, he'd be eligible to play the final seven weeks of the regular season (as well as the playoffs, given that the Steelers currently stand as the AFC's No. 2 seed) while collecting the remainder \u2014 nearly $6 million \u2014 of his pro-rated $14.54 million tag.\n\nIf Bell stays away, he cannot play this season.\n\nHere are a few other FAQs regarding his situation:\n\nIf Bell reports, will he get an extension?\n\nNo, at least not this year. The deadline for franchised players to sign a long-term contract in 2018 was July 16. For the second straight summer, Bell and the Steelers failed to strike an agreement. He could accept a multi-year deal with Pittsburgh after the season, but that would make little sense given free agency's lure in March.\n\nCan the Steelers deal Bell this year?\n\nNo. The league's trade deadline passed Oct. 30.\n\nCan the Steelers rescind the tag?\n\nYes. It would immediately catapult Bell into free agency. There's also no incentive for Pittsburgh to do that ... so, basically, forget it.\n\nCould Pittsburgh put the transition tag on Bell in 2019?\n\nYes. Its value, as yet undetermined, would be less than the franchise tag. It would also likely lure other teams to negotiate with Bell and spur him to sign an offer sheet. If Bell takes an offer, the Steelers would have the ability to match the terms, or else let him go to the new team. (A similar process exists for the franchise tag, but the bidding team would have to surrender two first-round draft picks if their offer sheet was not matched by the player's previous team \u2014 Pittsburgh in this case. If the Steelers use the transition tag, they would not receive any compensation beyond a league-issued compensatory pick if Bell signs elsewhere.)\n\nCould Pittsburgh franchise Bell a third time in 2019?\n\nYes. But it almost surely won't happen. Bell would command a quarterback-level salary with a third tag, likely more than $25 million, a prohibitive number. The Steelers currently have about $20 million in cap space for 2019.\n\nWhat if the Steelers don't tag Bell again?\n\nThen he'll become a free agent in 2019, the outcome he's sought all along.\n\nWhat kind of money is Bell seeking?\n\nWho knows? According to NFL Media, he turned down a five-year, $70 million offer in July, when Atlanta's Devonta Freeman and Buffalo's LeSean McCoy were the highest-paid backs on multi-year deals, both in the $8 million range annually. Since then, Todd Gurley signed a four-year, $57.5 million extension, while David Johnson received an additional three years for $39 million. However, according to multiple reports, Bell had been seeking something approaching $17 million per season (which would bring him in line with teammate Antonio Brown, a wideout) since he feels his receiver skill set distinguishes him from his peers.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "Vancouver Canucks goaltender Jacob Markstrom stops a shot on goal by New York Rangers' Vladislav Namestnikov (90) during the second period of an NHL hockey game Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in New York.

Nowell's two free throws with 25 seconds left ended up giving the Huskies (2-1) the cushion they needed and forced San Diego to try a contested 3-pointer in the closing seconds.\n\nTyler Williams had a look at a corner 3-pointer for the Toreros, but it hit off the front rim and the Huskies were able to escape with the victory.\n\n\"We had an action drawn up and they sat on it. ... I thought Tyler got a pretty good shot up all things considered. Tyler's made three game winners in his career so when he let it go I thought it was going in,\" San Diego coach Sam Scholl said.\n\nNowell hit 6 of 11 shots, but Washington's offense again lagged. Nahziah Carter added 11 points off the bench.\n\nOlin Carter III led the Toreros (2-1) with 17 points and Isaiah Pineiro added 14 despite foul trouble that limited his time in the first half. Yauhen Massalski had 12 points and 11 rebounds and helped the Toreros take a 32-31 lead at halftime.\n\nSan Diego scored 16 straight points that spanned the end of the first half and opening minutes of the second and took a nine-point lead with 16 minutes left. That's when Washington erupted on a 19-2 run that appeared it would be enough to shake the Toreros. Hameir Wright's 3-pointer gave the Huskies a 55-47 lead with 10 minutes remaining.\n\nBut San Diego didn't go away, scoring 12 of the next 14 points and taking a 59-57 lead on Isaiah Wright's 3. Dickerson pulled Washington even at 59-all and two free throws from Hameir Wright gave the Huskies a 61-60 lead. Washington's final seven points came at the free throw line, but it was Nowell's final two that proved the most important.\n\nMassalski was fouled with 29 seconds left and the Toreros trailing 64-62. He hit the first but the second free throw rimmed out. Nowell was fouled and hit both free throws, and Washington escaped. The Huskies were 15 of 17 at the line for the game.\n\n\"We have to play with that sense of urgency for longer periods of time,\" Hopkins said. \"How many times did we get eight-point leads and we gave it back? That's stuff from last year and we have to grow from that.\"\n\nFORGETTABLE TRIP\n\nWashington's road trip and loss to No. 9 Auburn was forgettable for multiple reasons. First, the Huskies played poorly in the 88-66 loss that dropped them out of The AP Top 25. Turned out that was just the start. Freshman Elijah Hardy broke his left hand in the few moments he played against the Tigers and is likely to miss six weeks. And the Huskies bus caught fire as it made its way to the airport for the charter flight back to Seattle. The majority of Washington's gear and equipment was undamaged in the fire.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nSan Diego: The Toreros first foray against a Pac-12 opponent this season has to be considered successful. The Toreros have three more chances to get a win against a Pac-12 team this season, including Colorado at home next week. San Diego won at Colorado last season.\n\n\"We're very critical of ourselves. We learn from it. We see it on tape, we take it in and then we make a vow we're not going to make those same mistakes again. That's all you can do,\" Scholl said.\n\nWashington: The starting backcourt of Matisse Thybulle and Crisp had a combined 12 points on 5-of-16 shooting.

(AP) \u2014 Ending a 14-game losing streak that spanned nearly four years to the San Antonio Spurs didn't mean as much to Sacramento as finishing its quick four-game homestand with an even record.\n\nIt's understandable, since many of these young Kings were still in high school the last time Sacramento beat the Spurs.\n\nIman Shumpert made a tiebreaking jumper with 4:05 remaining, De'Aaron Fox and Nemanja Bjelica followed with 3-pointers and the Kings pulled away for a 104-99 victory on Monday night.\n\n\"Man, I don't really care about the streak,\" Sacramento center Willie Cauley-Stein said. \"More or less that was a must-win game. We have to defend home, you know? We slipped up and missed one last game so this one was a must-win mentality coming in. We got it.\"\n\nThe Kings had lost two of their three games on this homestand, including a 101-88 defeat to the Lakers on Saturday in the second half of a back-to-back.\n\nRested and back to its running ways, Sacramento took advantage of an injury-riddled Spurs team to beat San Antonio for the first time since Nov. 15, 2014.\n\nIt certainly left an impression on Spurs coach Gregg Popovich.\n\n\"Their culture is changing,\" Popovich said. \"Guys are committed, guys are physical, taking some pride in defense. They look really good.\"\n\nFox finished with 19 points and seven assists. Cauley-Stein had 13 points and 13 rebounds, and Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 22 points for the Kings.\n\nSacramento led the entire third quarter but didn't shake San Antonio until late in the fourth.\n\nDeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge made back-to-back long jumpers to tie the score at 90-all with 5:11 remaining. The Spurs went cold after that and made three baskets down the stretch, all of them 3-pointers.\n\nShumpert broke the tie with his 16-foot jumper.\n\nAldridge had 14 points and 18 rebounds. DeRozan scored 23 points with eight assists, and Rudy Gay added 14 points and nine rebounds in his return to the Spurs lineup.\n\n\"There was just a bunch of miscommunication, switching, and a lot of things that caused us to collapse,\" DeRozan said. \"They took an advantage of it and hit the three shots when they needed them. They exploited us and made us turn the ball over when we made a mistake.\"\n\nBogdanovic had 11 points off the bench in the first half while Fox hit a pair of 3-pointers to help give the Kings a 56-55 lead at the break after San Antonio made a late run.\n\nSacramento took advantage of the Spurs' cold shooting in the third to take control. San Antonio made more free throws (eight) than it did baskets (six) in the quarter.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSpurs: Pau Gasol (left foot soreness) missed his third consecutive game. ... Gay, who spent three-plus seasons with the Kings before signing with San Antonio last year, missed the three previous games because of right heel soreness.\n\nKings: Two nights after having only nine assists in a loss to the Lakers, Sacramento dished out 27 against San Antonio. ...

Kosta Koufos (right calf) did not play.\n\nBOGEY'S BACK\n\nThe Kings are continuing to be cautious with Bogdanovic as he recovers from a pair of knee procedures in the offseason. Bogdanovic played nearly 25 minutes against the Spurs and shot 9 of 17 with three 3s.\n\n\"He's trying to find his rhythm a little bit and he's also playing with some guys that maybe he hasn't played with before,\" coach Dave Joerger said. \"But I thought he was really feeling it and did a terrific job.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSpurs: Play at Phoenix on Wednesday.\n\nKings: Play at Memphis on Friday.\n\n__\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: ROBERT HANASHIRO, USA TODAY)\n\nPaul Bancroft had been through Southern California wildfires before, but never as bad as the one that threatened to burn down his home this time.\n\nThe fire burned \u201cright up to the fence (and) started burning in my bushes,\u201d he said of the conflagration designated the Woolsey Fire. \u201cI built my home, and I didn\u2019t want to leave.\"\n\nThough Bancroft saved his home, many homeowners who lost their homes have to contemplate whether to start anew -- and some experts say enough is enough. It makes no sense to rebuild again in brushy areas that are repeatedly swept by wildfires, they argue.\n\nAs of now, the worst of the Woolsey Fire appears to be over. Though only 68 percent contained as of Friday, the winds that fed the blaze had died down. The fire destroyed more than 616 homes and other structures, killing three people and blackening more than 98,000 acres from Calabasas to Malibu, including Bancroft's neighborhood in the bucolic Agoura Hills.\n\nDevastating wildfires are nothing new in the dry, brush-covered hills north of Los Angeles. In Malibu alone, an average of two major fires have raced through every decade since 1929, according to a history compiled by the Malibu Times, the local newspaper. Each successive blaze has claimed more homes, reflecting increasing development in the area \u2013 100 structures in a 1956 blaze, 103 in 1970, 230 in 1978 and 268 in 1993.\n\nAfter each fire, the city and its companion communities \u2013 home to celebrities ranging from Miley Cyrus to Will Smith \u2013 have rebuilt, usually even more spectacularly than before.\n\nBesides the threat to life, there's the cost to taxpayers involving the massive effort needed to fight the fires.\n\nThe average cost of defending a home under threat from wildfires is about $82,000, said Ray Rasker, executive director of Headwaters Economics, a nonprofit that works with communities on strategies to reduce wildfire risk. In one fire, the average cost was $683,000 per property.\n\nMore: Camp Fire death toll reaches 42, deadliest wildfire in California history\n\nRelated: Lawmakers take Trump to task for threatening to withhold federal fire funds\n\nAlso: Fireproof homes could be the answer to massive wildfires across the West\n\n\"People want to live with a national forest in their backyard,\" Rasker said, and as a result \"are building in harm's way.\"\n\nGiven the costs to society and danger to inhabitants, some, however, believe it may be time to break the burn-rebuild-burn-again cycle.\n\nUnder some circumstances, that might mean not rebuilding in an area repeatedly ravaged by fire and helping residents to relocate, said Alice Hill, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a think tank at Stanford University in California, who helped develop climate-change policy during the Obama administration.\n\nA community might let its residents know and agree in advance: If an area burns yet again, no rebuilding will be allowed, she said.\n\n\"It's not just the homeowners at risk, it's the firefighters,\" she said. \"There is a whole host of reasons not to build in an area.\"\n\nAt very least, Hill said, areas prone to wildfire need much stricter building codes \u2013 including the possibility of retroactive code revisions to force homeowners to make their properties fire resistant. Tougher rules would need to be backed by strict enforcement.\n\nCLOSE An antique building burns out of control in Paradise, California.

Entire neighborhoods in Kinston, North Carolina, were relocated to higher ground after three out of four homes were damaged or flooded by three hurricanes in the 1990s, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notesin a report.\n\nIn Malibu, where single ocean-view mansions routinely hit the real-estate listings in the millions, acquiring property and moving residents would be a complicated issue.\n\n\"Malibu is a whole different part of the planet,\" said Char Miller, professor of environmental analysis & history at Pomona College in Claremont, California. \"The dilemmas that come from that are many and costly.\"\n\nThe community could, for instance, buy up development rights in places that are yet to burn, he said. Or, perhaps more practically, it could get tough on common-sense safety measures like 200 feet of brush clearance around homes and banishing wooden porches.\n\nNo matter what course a city chooses, it should do something, Miller said. With climate change bearing down, wildfires show no sign of being any less intense. It's time to act, Miller said.\n\n\"Surely nature has sent up enough signal flares,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/12/california-wildfires-fire-destroy-homes-rebuild/1985117002/", "Buffalo's Jayvon Graves (3) and Jeenathan Williams (11) reach for a rebound along with Southern Illinois' Darius Beane (5), Marcus Bartley and Rudy Stradnieks (24) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game Monday, Nov. 12, 2018, in Carbondale, Ill.

The Wildcats' did just that, and Pardon delivered 18 rebounds and 13 points.\n\nNorthwestern struggled early in the game, falling behind in the first ten minutes. Vic Law supplied the bulk of the team's offense, scoring 16 of his 26 points in the first half. But the outside shots weren't falling for the Wildcats, so they began to look inside. What they found there was the lead.\n\n\"When it wasn't going down, we decided to go inside. Derek had it a lot.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 From key players healed after injuries to multi-talented newcomers filling out the rotation, Minnesota has a much deeper team than last season.\n\nGabe Kalscheur is part of that fresh start, set up to help the Gophers fix a long-running weakness in outside shooting.\n\nKalscheur went 5-for-6 from 3-point range and had 19 points in his second college game as all five Minnesota starters scored in double digits, guiding the Gophers past Utah 78-69 on Monday night.\n\n\"We're really confident in his ability to shoot when teams are trying to zone us, and that's something that we were really missing for a very long time since I've been here,\" said senior power forward Jordan Murphy, who had 11 points, 17 rebounds and five assists.\n\nThe Gophers finished 10th, 11th and 14th in the Big Ten in 3-point shooting the last three seasons. Kalscheur is 7 for 9 so far. One of three freshmen from the Twin Cities area and less-heralded than four-star recruit Daniel Oturu, the 6-foot-4 Kalscheur even surprised coach Richard Pitino by forcing his way into the starting lineup at shooting guard with his maturity and hustle during preseason practices.\n\n\"I needed to have a guy who was smart out there and was going to be solid,\" Pitino said.\n\nAmir Coffey had 14 points and six assists, Oturu pitched in 13 points and Dupree McBrayer added 11 points and six assists for the Gophers (2-0), who registered 20 assists to just 11 turnovers.\n\nSedrick Barefield and Vante Hendrix each scored 14 points for the Utes (1-1), who trailed for the final 25 minutes of the game. Novak Topalovic, the 7-foot graduate transfer, had 13 points and three rebounds. Donnie Tillman added nine points and nine rebounds.\n\n\"I don't think we were awestruck by any kind of environment. I thought some of our young kids actually stepped up and had pretty good road games,\" coach Larry Krystkowiak said. \"It's just consistency.\"\n\nCoffey's 3-pointer with 5:53 left in the first half gave the Gophers the lead for good at 20-18, and he followed with a steal of Timmy Allen for a fast break and a dunk. Kalscheur sank his fourth 3-pointer of the half for a 33-26 advantage at the intermission.\n\n\"He's kind of an unknown commodity,\" Krystkowiak said. \"He got hot, and we didn't do a good job of having a hand up, and that's the difference.\"\n\nThe Utes led the Pac-12 in defense last season, allowing an average of 68.5 points per game on 41 percent shooting from the floor. The Gophers made 17 of 28 field goals (60.7 percent) in the second half, a tone set early by Kalscheur.\n\n\"He's just got a pro mentality, so every time he shoots nobody's surprised when it goes in,\" Pitino said.\n\nDOWN THE STRETCH\n\nWith a jumper from the wing by Michael Hurt off a fast break, the Gophers took their biggest lead of the game at 57-42.\n\nThe Utes used some full-court press and a surge by Barefield, their only returning starter, to cut the deficit to 62-57 on a step-back jumper with 6:13 remaining. But the Gophers responded with a dunk by Oturu off a lob pass from McBrayer, and a jump shot by McBrayer in the final minute brought the lead back to 13 points.\n\n\"With some of the freshmen, they were a little down at times. Even myself, and I'm a sophomore now,\" Tillman said. \"But that's basketball for you.

They last played in Utah on Nov. 19, 2003.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nUtah: With nine new players on the roster, including six freshmen, the nonconference portion of the season could bring some growing pains for a squad that lost three of the top four scorers from the 2017-18 team that reached the NIT championship game.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Eli Manning threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Sterling Shepard with 53 seconds left and the New York Giants snapped a five-game losing streak by beating the San Francisco 49ers 27-23 on Monday night.\n\n\"It meams a lot,\" Manning said. \"That's what I told the guys this week. We've worked too hard not to be rewarded with wins. ... We just weren't able to get some of the outcomes or make the plays we needed to win. Today we were able to do that.\"\n\nManning threw two TD passes to Odell Beckham Jr. and then engineered the late game-winning drive with help from a pair of third-down penalties against Malcolm Smith and Ahkello Witherspoon.\n\nSaquon Barkley then had a 23-yard catch to get the ball into the red zone and Manning connected with Shepard on third down to give the Giants (2-7) the win.\n\n\"I just saw man-to-man coverage,\" Shepard said. \"That's something we've been practicing. I was able to capture the outside edge and Eli put the ball in a perfect place.\"\n\nMatt Breida ran for 101 yards and scored two touchdowns for the 49ers (2-8), who were unable to win consecutive games under third-string quarterback Nick Mullens. Breida's 23-yard run helped set up a 30-yard field goal by Robbie Gould that gave the Niners a 23-20 lead with 2:46 to play.\n\nBut the 49ers allowed the go-ahead score and couldn't pull it out at the end as Mullens' pass from the Giants 20 sailed out of the end zone on the final play.\n\nMullens wasn't nearly as sharp as he was in his NFL debut against the Raiders on Nov. 1 when he joined Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and Fran Tarkenton as the only players with at least 250 yards passing, three touchdown passes and no interceptions in the first career game.\n\nMullens threw for 250 yards and had an 11-yard TD pass to Breida that made it 20-10 early in the third quarter. But Mullens also threw two interceptions with the first setting up a 10-yard TD pass from Manning to Beckham .\n\nThose two connected again on a 20-yard score in the third quarter as New York rallied from 10 points down to tie the game in the second half.\n\nHARD HIT\n\nNiners receiver Marquise Goodwin was hit in the helmet by Alec Ogletree on a catch late in the third quarter and briefly left the game. On his first play back in to start the fourth quarter, a pass from Mullens deflected off Goodwin's hands for the second interception of the game by B.J. Goodson . Goodwin was slow to get up after that play and went back into the medical tent for observation. Goodwin returned to the game later in the fourth quarter.\n\nMISSED OPPORTUNITY\n\nThe Giants entered the game converting just 40 percent of their red zone trips into TDs. They missed a golden opportunity for one late in the first half. On a third down from the 3, the 49ers left Beckham unguarded in the slot but Manning stuck with a run play to Barkley that gained only 1 yard. New York settled for a field goal that tied the game at 10.\n\nThe Niners then drove down for a late field goal to take the lead at the break as the Giants trailed at the half for the eighth time this season.\n\nPLAYING FOR PARADISE\n\nNiners GM John Lynch welcomed the high school football team from Paradise, a town destroyed by the wildfires in Butte County, about 175 miles north. Players and cheerleaders from the school were on the field for the national anthem. The air quality for the game was at an unhealthy level because of the fires.\n\nThe Air Quality Index was at 161 at kickoff, which is in the unhealthy zone, and smoke could be smelled throughout the stadium. The NFL had monitored the situation but the AQI never got near 200, the level where the game would have needed to be moved.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGiants: Host Tampa Bay on Sunday.\n\n49ers: Visit Tampa Bay on Nov. 25.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Orlin Wagner) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Kansas guard Lagerald Vick followed his underwhelming season-opening performance against Michigan State with what Bill Self called the best offensive performance of anybody he's ever coached.\n\nVick went 8 for 8 from outside the 3-point arc. He hit two more deep 2s with his foot on the line. And the only shots he missed were a short hook and what Self called \"a dipsy-do layup,\" giving the senior a career-high 32 points in an 84-68 victory over Vermont on Monday night.\n\n\"He was fabulous,\" Self said. \"He was great. He carried us.\"\n\nVick got some help from Udoka Azubuike, who had 23 points and 11 rebounds, and Devon Dotson, who kept finding Vick open on the perimeter while adding 10 points and 10 assists for the second-ranked Jayhawks.\n\n\"It was really just confidence,\" Vick said, \"Coach and my teammates giving it to me before the game. Just going out there and really playing for the team.\"\n\nKansas (2-0) was jumped by Duke for the top spot in the AP poll earlier in the day, even though it beat the No. 10 Spartans in the Champions Classic last week. And for most of their game against the Catamounts (1-1), the Jayhawks did little to prove the voters wrong.\n\nThey led just 40-36 at halftime before two big runs allowed Self to breathe easy.\n\n\"That,\" he said, \"was a really good team we played tonight.\"\n\nAnthony Lamb had 24 points, Ernie Duncan added 17 and Stef Smith scored 13 for the Catamounts, who have lost nine straight to ranked teams dating to a win over Boston College in 2006.\n\nThe Catamounts looked as if that streak might end when they went on an early 18-4 run, hitting a series of quick 3-pointers while double-teaming Azubuike on defense whenever he got the ball.\n\nThe Jayhawks' 7-footer still muscled his way to 12 first-half points.\n\n\"I think we came out shooting really hot from 3 and that kind of grabbed their attention,\" Duncan said. \"We could feel them turn it up a notch as we got going.\"\n\nBut while the Catamounts sent waves of bodies at Azubuike inside, and made fellow Kansas forward Dedric Lawson a non-factor, they didn't account for Vick on the perimeter.\n\nAfter struggling mightily in the Jayhawks' season-opening win over the Spartans, Vick poured in four first-half 3s and piled up 16 points. Most of them came as the Jayhawks struggled to run offense through their two freshman guards, Dotson and Quentin Grimes.\n\nEventually, the Jayhawks' depth and talent wore down Vermont.\n\nIt was 44-40 before Azubuike added another of his rim-rattling dunks and then scored on a putback. Vick followed a jumper with his sixth 3-pointer and added his seventh a couple of minutes later as the Jayhawks' lead swelled to 61-45 midway through the second half.\n\n\"Azubuike was a monster down low,\" Vermont coach John Becker said. \"It's just hard to know what to do with him. If you double him, you have guys making 3s.\"\n\nVermont went on one last run to get its deficit under 10, but Azubuike added two more baskets and Vick curled in his eighth 3-pointer. That matched Mario Chalmers for most in the Self era at Kansas and left Vick trailing only Terry Brown, who hit 11 in a game in 1991.\n\nVick finished 12 of 14 from the field in helping Kansas win its 46th straight home opener.\n\n\"Vick was unbelievable tonight,\" Becker said. \"Sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a guy.\"\n\nSTATS AND STREAKS\n\nVermont has not beaten a Big 12 opponent since former member Colorado in 2008. ... The Catamounts had 11 assists to 12 turnovers. ... Kansas has not dropped a home opener since losing to Vanderbilt on Dec. 2, 1972. ...

(Photo: AP)\n\nCHICAGO \u2013 Authorities on Monday were trying to piece together how a suburban Chicago police officer ended up fatally shooting a black security guard who was detaining a suspected gunman who opened fire at the bar where he worked.\n\nThe 26-year-old armed guard, Jemel Roberson, was pinning down the suspect outside Manny\u2019s Blue Room in Robbins, Illinois, early Sunday when an officer dispatched to the scene opened fire on him, according to witnesses and a federal lawsuit filed Monday by Roberson\u2019s mother.\n\nWitnesses say they believe the officer, who works for the neighboring Midlothian Police Department, may have acted rashly upon seeing an armed black man upon arriving at the scene. Midlothian Police Chief Dan Delaney said in an e-mail to the Associated Press that the officer is white. No other details about the officer have been released.\n\n\u201cEverybody was screaming out, \u2018He was a security guard,\u2019 and they basically saw a black man with a gun and killed him,\u201d witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV.\n\nOfficials said Roberson had been working at the bar early Sunday morning when a dispute involving several men broke out, leading to gunfire inside the bar.\n\nThe incident escalated when one of the men opened fire inside the bar around 4 a.m., according to Sam Randall, a Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman. A lawsuit filed by Roberson\u2019s mother, Beatrice Roberson, on Monday alleges that \u201csome patrons\u201d shot the bartender and others.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges the officer used \u201cunprovoked\u201d and \u201cexcessive\u201d force in fatally shooting Roberson. Beatrice Roberson is seeking more than $1 million in damages from the village of Midlothian and the officer, who is identified as John Doe in the complaint.\n\n\u201cThe shooting of the decedent Jemel Roberson was unreasonable,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nMidlothian Police Chief Daniel Delaney said in a statement that officers responding to the shooting found multiple victims inside the bar. Midlothian police as well as the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Office were asked by Robbins Police to dispatch officers to the scene.\n\nDelaney noted the \u201cMidlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun\u201d before discharging his weapon. In addition to Roberson, four others \u2013 including the suspected gunman \u2013 were shot during the incident.\n\nThe incident comes more than a month after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was found guilty by a jury of second-degree battery and aggravated battery for the 2014 shooting death of Laquan McDonald. That controversial incident \u2013 police video showed McDonald was armed with a small knife but was walking away from police when Van Dyke fired 16 times \u2013 spurred protest and political tumult in the nation's third-largest city.\n\nRev. Michael Pfleger, a Chicago pastor and civil rights leader, said the Midlothian officer \"must face the same consequence as Van Dyke.\"\n\n\"He must be Indicted.....and White Society's \"Fear of Black Men\" must END!!!!\" Pfleger posted on Twitter.\n\nThe Illinois State Police Public Integrity Taskforce is conducting an investigation of the officer-involved shooting, while the sheriff\u2019s office was investigating the shooting inside the bar. The suspect, who was shot at some point inside the bar, remained hospitalized Monday and had not been charged.\n\nThe circumstances of Roberson\u2019s shooting spurred anger as well as sympathy.\n\nA GoFundMe page to help his family pay for funeral costs had collected more than $20,000 as of late Monday.\n\n\u201cHow in the world does the security guard get shot by the police?\u201d Rev.

When the forward returned to the floor, he had a medical bandana wrapped around his head to cover the cut. Apparently, that led to \"Headband Joe\" trending on social media in Utah. \"That's what I've been striving for my whole life,\" Ingles said of the social media nod.

The 6-foot-3 guard broke out against Prairie View by hitting 7-of-10 shots with three 3-pointers and started a game-turning run.\n\n\"In the first game, I had a lot of jitters and was wondering what it was going to be like,\" Butler said. \"Once I feel comfortable and I feel the environment I play better, and I play more comfortable. That's what you saw tonight a little bit.\"\n\nThe Bears (2-1), who opened their season last week with a loss to another SWAC team, never trailed and led by as many as 16 points in the first half. But their lead was only 59-57 left with 9\u00bd minutes left before a 22-8 run that included a run of 13 consecutive points.\n\n\"I think we play in spurts. We can be really, really good, and we can be really, really bad,\" Baylor coach Scott Drew said. \"And that's what you get with inexperience. ... The good parts are great; the bad parts are really bad.\"\n\nButler scored the first six points in the 13-0 run, including two free throws, a jumper and a layup. McClure then had a 3-pointer and a layup before Tristan Clark emphatically closed out that 2\u00bd-minute spurt with a block at one end and a two-handed dunk at the other to make it 78-61.\n\nClark had 17 points on 5-of-5 shooting, along with seven rebounds and five blocked shots. Devonte Bandoo scored 16 points. McClure also had eight rebounds.\n\nPrairie View (1-1) had five players in double figures, led by Gary Blackston's 18 points. Darius Williams had 16, and Gerard Andrus posted 14 points and nine rebounds. Chancellor Ellis had 12 points, and Taishaun Johnson 11.\n\n\"You come in here trying to win, but I think you can win and not have the most points at the end of the night,\" Prairie View coach Byron Smith said. \"I think we won in some areas in that we didn't quit, and we battled on the glass. Obviously, you want to win, but if you can't there's a way to lose. It could have been worse. ... We'll take it.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nPrairie View: Despite being Prairie View's second-leading scorer, Williams was a nonfactor for most of the game. He picked up another quick foul after the technical he got following consecutive 3s to start the game. He played only 10 minutes and didn't score again until the 2:29 mark of the second half. ... The Panthers were 11 for 22 from beyond the arc, which allowed them to stay in the game.\n\nBaylor: The Bears' size advantage in the paint showed up with nine blocks, but they only had a 32-31 edge on the boards. Baylor kept Prairie View without a 2-point basket for nearly 11 minutes, shot 61 percent (31 of 51) from the field and 48 percent (11 of 23) on 3s.\n\nSWAC SEASON\n\nBaylor opened its season with three consecutive games against teams from the Southwestern Athletic Conference. After losing the opener 72-69 to Texas Southern last Tuesday, their first loss ever to a SWAC team, the Bears responded with a win over Southern University on Saturday before beating Prairie View. The Bears are 58-1 all-time against the SWAC, 15-0 against Prairie View. This was Baylor's last SWAC opponent.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPrairie View A&M will continue its season-opening 12-game road trip against Texas-Rio Grande Valley on Wednesday.\n\nBaylor will close out a four-game home stand when it hosts Nicholls State on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Hannah Foslien) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Butler is gone and so is Minnesota's losing streak, after a victory over a Nets team devastated by a gruesome injury to leading scorer Caris LeVert.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns had 25 points and a season-high 21 rebounds, and the Timberwolves beat Brooklyn 120-113 on Monday after finally trading Butler.\n\nJeff Teague returned from a six-game absence to score 24 points for Minnesota, which snapped a five-game losing streak.\n\n\"It's good to get a win after the slide we've been having,\" Towns said. \"It doesn't matter how it comes, pretty or ugly. As long as it ends up being a win, we're good with that.\"\n\nThe Nets lost LeVert to what appeared to be a severe right leg injury late in the first half that brought the entire crowd at Target Center to a silence.\n\nLeVert spent several minutes on the court being attended by medical personnel. Nets players surrounded their injured teammate before he was wheeled off the court.\n\n\"I just think it's a devastating blow for us, for him. That's all I really want to say about this,\" Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said. \"Our thoughts should be with him and his recovery. And I really don't want to talk about the game or anything else.\"\n\nThe Timberwolves officially dealt Butler to the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday, along with big man Justin Patton. The Wolves received Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick in the trade.\n\nButler had asked for a trade earlier in the season but coach and president of basketball of operations Tom Thibodeau said Monday that the team tried to remain patient in waiting for the right deal for the All-Star. Thibodeau refuted a report that Butler's trade demand included sending him to only a handful of teams.\n\nIn the first game of the post-Butler era, Minnesota used a strong effort from the backcourt duo of Teague and Derrick Rose, who had 23 points in 39 minutes. Teague was aggressive on offense for Minnesota in his first game since Oct. 29.\n\n\"We needed the downhill play and the attack,\" Thibodeau said. \"I thought he and Derrick put a lot of pressure on them.\"\n\nA former first-round pick in his third season, LeVert was averaging a team-high 19 points entering the game. He had 10 points, five rebounds and four assists before suffering the injury with just a few seconds remaining before halftime.\n\nLeVert was taken to a hospital for further evaluation. Players from around the league tweeted out their support for LeVert shortly after the injury occurred.\n\n\"There were really just no words,\" said Nets forward Joe Harris. \"We didn't talk even when we came in at halftime. There's nothing really to be said. You could just feel it, the emotions from everybody. Guys were crying coming in, it was really that horrific just to see.\"\n\nD'Angelo Russell made a career-high nine 3-pointers and scored 31 points for the Nets, who shot a season-worst 39.6 percent from the field.\n\nNeither team led by more than five points until late in the third quarter, when Gorgui Dieng's 3-pointer and a pair of free throws by Teague extended Minnesota's advantage to 10 points. Brooklyn cut it to 97-96 early in the fourth before the Wolves pulled away.\n\nMinnesota overcame a season-high 23 turnovers.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nNets: C Jarrett Allen missed the game due to illness. Allen has averaged 11.4 points and 7.8 rebounds this season. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson started at center. ... Brooklyn's bench outscored Minnesota's reserves 40-18, including 14 from Spencer Dinwiddie.\n\nTimberwolves: Teague had been out with a bruised left knee. ... SF Andrew Wiggins (right quad contusion) was back after sitting out Minnesota's game Friday at Sacramento. .. Minnesota is now 5-1 at home and 0-8 on the road.\n\nWOLVES PLAYERS PRAY FOR LEVERT\n\nAs LeVert was on the court following his leg injury, Anthony Tolliver huddled his teammates together for a prayer.\n\n\"It's really a tough situation, because we all know that could be us,\" Tolliver said. \"We just know that sick feeling. We definitely wanted to do what we could. I got the guys together and prayed for him.\"\n\nRose noted that he's been on the court when three players suffered serious leg injuries: Paul George, Gordon Hayward and now LeVert.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNets: Host Miami on Wednesday night.\n\nTimberwolves: Host New Orleans on Wednesday night.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 Kenny Williams spent two games missing shot after shot in an unusually cold stretch for No. 7 North Carolina's senior starting guard and top defensive player.\n\nHe tried not to get too frustrated and kept believing the next ones were sure to fall \u2014 until they finally did against Stanford on Monday night.\n\nWilliams scored 12 points after starting the season by missing his first 10 shots, and UNC dominated the first half to beat Stanford 90-72 in its home opener.\n\nIt was a good sign for Williams, whose 0-for-10 shooting start through two games included missing all eight of his 3-point tries. It was an odd stretch for a guy who had improved to a 40 percent 3-point shooter last season and a complementary double-figure scorer, yet he entered this game with just a single free throw in Friday's win against Elon to his credit.\n\nBut he scored on a layup less than 90 seconds in Monday, then followed with 3 a few minutes later to finally break through.\n\n\"It was a big relief,\" Williams admitted, even as he tried to shrug off the frustration.\n\n\"I wasn't doing anything different to my shot,\" he said. \"Like I told you guys, it just wasn't going in.

You could see that in the pace of their cuts. You could see that in how they get open. ... You can see that when they hit the paint and they're not looking for a teammate.

Haase, a former Kansas player and UNC assistant under Tar Heels coach Roy Williams, acknowledged Friday the slate is \"pretty insane\" but will prepare his players for handling road games. Still, this was a reminder of how difficult that can be, with the Cardinal starting 1 for 12 in a first half that quickly got away from them.\n\n\"My goal going into this game was just to see our guys compete,\" Haase said. \"Offensively and defensively, especially in the first half, I didn't feel that we did.\"\n\nUNC: The Tar Heels opened the season with wins at Wofford and Elon, marking the first time the program had opened with two road games since 1986-87. One avenged a stunning December home loss from last year, while the other ended up being North Carolina's best scoring output since November 2008.

(AP Photo/Kyle Phillips) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Once the Oklahoma City Thunder got going, the Phoenix Suns couldn't stop them.\n\nPaul George matched his season high with 32 points and went 6 of 10 from 3-point range, Dennis Schroder added 20 points and nine assists, and the Thunder beat the Suns 118-101 on Monday night.\n\nOklahoma City scored 22 straight points in the first quarter, holding the Suns scoreless for nearly seven minutes, to take a 24-5 lead. The Thunder never trailed again and led by as many as 28 points in the second quarter before settling for a 64-40 halftime lead. The Suns whittled that margin down to seven points in the fourth quarter but came no closer.\n\n\"As a group, I thought we sensed the energy,\" George said. \"I felt we were the more aggressive team. . I thought we just jumped on them. Once you get one stop, you get another, and at that point, we were just in a groove. We felt good out there.\"\n\nThe Thunder have won eight of their last nine games after a 0-4 start while the Suns have lost four straight and 11 of their last 12. Two of those losses have come in Oklahoma City.\n\nThe Thunder were 13 of 27 on 3-point attempts.\n\nThe Thunder played a fourth straight game without star guard Russell Westbrook, who sat out with a sprained left ankle on his 30th birthday. They didn't need him against Phoenix, thanks to George, Schroder and Steven Adams, who had 18 points, seven rebounds, three steals and two blocked shots.\n\nT.J. Warren led the Suns with 21 points while Devin Booker had 19 points and six assists.\n\n\"The way we opened the game, no presence, no life whatsoever,\" Phoenix coach Igor Kokoskov said. \"We were behind 20 points in the first quarter. That's hard. It put us in a situation that we have to compete and play the whole game and every possession has got to be perfect. You're looking for that spark, looking for that energy to bring us back in the game. I'm glad we found it. We were competing. We never quit.\"\n\nSchroder \u2014 who started the game 1 of 11 from the field \u2014 hit consecutive 3-pointers off passes from George (who had six assists and eight rebounds) to give the Thunder a 78-55 lead in the third quarter.\n\nPhoenix scored 12 straight points, though, and trailed only 86-75 at the end of the period. A 3-pointer by Jamal Crawford pulled the Suns within 93-86 with 7:56 left, but the Thunder had a 15-4 run and weren't challenged again.\n\n\"When we get out and go, we're a really good team,\" George said. \"When we get a little stagnant is when we struggle. That's all it came down to.\"\n\nThe Thunder are 16-4 against the Suns at home (after once being 0-3) and have won 23 of their last 29 games overall against Phoenix. The teams will play again Saturday in Phoenix and will wrap up their season series on Dec. 28, also in Phoenix.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSuns: Phoenix's 13 first-quarter points were the lowest by a Thunder opponent in an opening quarter this season . Warren has 20 3-pointers this season in 13 games after making 20 in 65 games last season.\n\nThunder: George's six 3-pointers were the most in a game by a Thunder player this season . Schroder received a technical foul in the third quarter . The two boxers who will fight at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Friday for the WBO welterweight title, reigning champ Maurice Hooker and Alex Saucedo of Oklahoma City, both attended the game.\n\nMASTER CLASS\n\nAdams often got the best of Phoenix rookie Deandre Ayton, leaving him befuddled at both ends of the court, particularly during the first half. Ayton finished with 14 points, but only four in the first half as Oklahoma City built a 28-point lead.\n\nAdams, who routinely scored around and over Ayton, was charitable when discussing the rookie.\n\n\"He's good, mate.

The Heat also had 12 turnovers in the second half.\n\n\"Some costly ones, momentum-changing ones,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.\n\nIt was the first meeting between the clubs since last season's playoffs, when Philadelphia ousted Miami in five games in the first round. And while Philadelphia led most of the way in this one, the 76ers never really pulled away until the final moments.\n\nTheir first double-digit lead of the night came on Embiid's step-back 3-pointer with 1:59 remaining. Simmons got loose for a dunk on the next Philadelphia possession, and that was the signal for most Miami fans to start heading to the exits.\n\n\"It's time. It's definitely time to start looking in the mirror,\" Richardson said after Miami fell to 5-8. \"It shouldn't have gotten to this point but it's definitely time to start cracking down and problem-solving.\"\n\nTIP-INS\n\n76ers: Rookie Landry Shamet is now wearing No. 1 \u2014 he was No. 23, which will be worn starting Wednesday by Butler. ... Embiid got his 14th double-double in 15 games this season. ... The 76ers scored exactly 32 points in each of the first three quarters, before settling for a mere 28 in the fourth.\n\nHeat: Dwyane Wade missed his fourth consecutive game because of the birth of his daughter. He'll miss at least the next three games as well. ... Miami has had a pair of four-game homestands already this season, and has gone 3-5 in those games. ... Whiteside had 13 points and 11 rebounds, and Olynyk scored 13 for Miami.\n\nSHOELESS SNAP\n\nMiami needed only 126 seconds of the second quarter to go on a 15-0 run, one that was snapped by a 3-pointer from Redick \u2014 who was coming out of one of his sneakers at the time. Redick lost his left shoe one possession earlier, tried in vain to get it on properly, and wound up swishing a 3 with it still askew.\n\nTHANKING VETS\n\nOn Military Appreciation Night, the Heat \u2014 who have paid tribute to veterans in pregame ceremonies for years \u2014 honored one of their own. Derric Franklin, who served eight years in the Army and was deployed in both Iraq and Afghanistan, was the honoree. Franklin is the coach of the Heat team in the NBA 2K League, and was surprised on the court by his mother and stepfather.\n\nUP NEXT\n\n76ers: Visit Orlando on Wednesday.\n\nHeat: Visit Brooklyn on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Iowa State's thin roster survived its opening home stand with three straight wins.\n\nNext up for the Cyclones, down four regulars because of injuries and suspensions, is a trip to Hawaii that should really test their mettle.\n\nMarial Shayok scored a career-high 26 points, freshman Talen Horton-Tucker had 26 as well and Iowa State held off Texas Southern 85-73 on Monday night.\n\nNick Weiler-Babb posted 13 points with 13 rebounds for the Cyclones (3-0), who have Maui Invitational games next week against Arizona, either third-ranked Gonzaga or Illinois and then an opponent yet to be determined.\n\n\"We made a lot of plays for each. We played a good offensive game as far as finding each other,\" Shayok said. \"We've just got to do a better job of staying locked in.\"\n\nPart of that was because the Tigers (1-2), who won four of the last five SWAC titles and beat Baylor on the road in their opener, didn't go away as easily as many of its conference companions typically do against Power Five opponents.\n\nTexas Southern got as close as 38-33 late in the first half before back-to-back 3s by Horton-Tucker helped Iowa State make it 48-35 at halftime.\n\nHorton-Tucker hit another jumper that gave Iowa State a 59-41 lead. But the Cyclones went into an extended shooting funk \u2014 0 for 11 marked by poor ball movement \u2014 and the Tigers sneaked back within 62-53.\n\nIowa State eventually found its way and pulled away, finishing 48 percent from the field. But beyond Horton-Tucker, the other three freshmen in Iowa State's rotation combined for just four points.\n\n\"We've got some youth out there. At times it showed,\" Prohm said.\n\nJeremy Combs had 16 points to lead the Tigers.\n\nTHE BIG PICTURE\n\nIowa State: Shayok transferred from Virginia to play in a more free-flowing offense. Through three games, it looks like he made the right call. Shayok has been a focal point of Iowa State's much improved attack, scoring at least 14 points in every contest. Shayok is averaging a team-high 20 points a game.\n\nTexas Southern: The Tigers are two-thirds of the way through perhaps the most grueling three-game stretch any team in America might face in 2018-19. They lost at Gonzaga 104-67 on Saturday, travelled 1,500 miles to play Iowa State and will now go from Ames to San Diego to play the Aztecs.\n\nHORTON-TUCKER\n\nThe most hyped recruit in Iowa State's latest class, Horton-Tucker had by far his best game in a Cyclones uniform. Horton-Tucker kept the Tigers at bay by hitting five 3s in the first half, and he finished 8 of 14 from the floor. Horton-Tucker also had five rebounds. \"He's a good player,\" Prohm said. \"He's young. He's going to have good games and he's going to have bad games. He's going to be up and down at times.\"\n\nWIGGINTON\n\nSophomore guard Lindell Wigginton, Iowa State's top returning scorer, spoke with reporters before the game on Monday for the first time since straining his left foot \u2014 an injury that forced him into a hard cast. Wigginton said he hurt the foot late in Iowa State's 79-53 win over Alabama State last week. \"I really just landed wrong on my foot, and then I just felt a pop,\" Wigginton said. \"I tried to play through it, but I really couldn't.\" Wigginton said his foot had been bothering him but that he thought it was just sore. He'll soon have his cast replaced by a boot, and Wigginton hopes to return sometime in December. But he's not going to rush it, especially given his pro prospects. \"He wants me to come back when I'm fully healed, 100 percent,\" Wigginton said of Prohm.\n\nTHE NUMBERS\n\nMichael Jacobson had 16 points and eight rebounds for Iowa State. ... Texas Southern's 7-foot-2 center, Trayvon Reed, had 15 points and 11 rebounds. ... The Cyclones had 16 turnovers. ...

After earning a spot on the roster out of training camp, he struggled to find the back of the net in the first 18 games.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 With an offense developing in fits and starts and going long stretches without baskets, Texas isn't exactly pretty, but the Longhorns are undefeated to start the season.\n\nMonday night was the latest example of coach Shaka Smart's work in progress: a 65-55 win over scrappy Louisiana-Monroe that Texas didn't control until midway through the second half.\n\nDylan Osetkowski scored 12 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for Texas. Elijah Mitrou-Long scored all nine of his points in the second half and his 3-pointer started a 16-0 run that allowed the Longhorns to pull away.\n\n\"Our guys are still trying to figure out how to play together,\" Smart said. \"I'm excited about where we're going ... I like that our guys have found ways to win games that we didn't necessarily play our best.\n\n\"The key is to win and grow,\" Smart said.\n\nTexas (3-0) led 30-29 at halftime and the game was tied at 43 until Mitrou-Long, a transfer guard from Mount St. Mary's, knocked down his 3-pointer to beat the shot clock. Osetkowski's reverse layup and free throw put Texas up by 10 and the Longhorns were finally in firm control.\n\nKerwin Roach II scored 13 points and had six assists for Texas.\n\n\"We've got a variety of guys who can score,\" Mitrou-Long said. \"Offensively, we're not really worried if the ball is going to go in or not. We're still going to shoot it. We all have confidence in each other.\"\n\nMichael Ertel led Louisiana-Monroe (2-1) with 16 points.\n\nSmart has mixed in some pressing defense early this season and the Longhorns turned 15 turnovers into 20 points. Warhawks coach Keith Richard said Texas turned the game with a switch to a zone defense in the second half that denied the Warhawks drives to the basket.\n\nEven Richard noted Texas is still looking for some kind of identity on offense.\n\n\"Obviously great size. Obviously talent. But are they a great driving team or are they a great post-up team or a great 3-point shooting team? What are they?\" Richard said. \"That will be the question.\"\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nLouisiana-Monroe: The Warhawks sorely missed leading scorer Daishon Smith, their top 3-point shooter. He didn't play against the Longhorns because of a hamstring injury and the Warhawks were 4 of 16 from 3-point range without him. They needed him to shoot over Texas' zone defense in the second half.\n\n\"I wish I had to do it all over again. I would've done it differently. I would have told 'em, 'Move it, move it, shoot a 3,'\" Richard said. \"We should have had (Smith) out there.\"\n\nTexas: The Longhorns didn't get much offensively from players Smart will be counting on in the Big 12. Roach, who Texas depends on as a catalyst on both ends of the floor, was 6-of-15 shooting. Point guard Matt Coleman III had five points, two assists and three turnovers. Jericho Sims, who may be one of the most athletic forwards in the Big 12, was a non-factor with three points.\n\nThe Longhorns had a lot of pretty passing that set up a lot of missed shots.\n\n\"Some of our best guys haven't played their best,\" Smart said. \"We've got to get those guys playing better.\"\n\nCLEANING IT UP\n\nIn Texas' first two games, the Longhorns averaged 15 turnovers. They had just six against the Warhawks. Osetkowski had nine in the first two games and none Monday night.\n\nFLASHY FRESHMAN\n\nTexas 6-foot-11 freshman Jaxson Hayes again showed flashes of real potential with 11 points, five rebounds and three blocks in 26 minutes. Hayes barely played as a junior in high school and didn't blossom as a basketball recruit until a growth spurt before his senior season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Warhawks have just started a run of five consecutive road games. They play at No. 11 Michigan State on Wednesday\n\nThe Longhorns host The Citadel on Friday in their final tuneup before facing No. 7 North Carolina next week.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Both those things happened again Monday night \u2014 but this one was different.\n\nThe winningest goalie in Carolina history took the loss in his first game here as a visitor, with Sebastian Aho scoring 1:16 into overtime to lift the Hurricanes past Ward's new team, the Chicago Blackhawks, 3-2 and spoiling the goalie's emotional return.\n\n\"Obviously, I have a lot to be thankful for, my 13 years here, and wanted to put forth a strong effort,\" Ward said. \"Unfortunately, we came to win, and it just slipped away there in overtime.\"\n\nTeuvo Teravainen and Micheal Ferland scored power-play goals 66 seconds apart late in the second period for Carolina, which has earned points in three straight and beat Chicago for the second time in four nights. But the two wins over the Blackhawks are their only victories since Oct. 26.\n\n\"We haven't won a lot lately and obviously, we need wins to get some confidence,\" Aho said. \"We've played in many games well, but we haven't found a way to get those wins, but this one feels definitely good.\"\n\nWard stopped 37 shots, Jonathan Toews scored a deflected goal and Alex DeBrincat added a goal, but the Blackhawks lost their eighth straight.\n\nCarolina's Scott Darling made 33 saves against his former team, in regulation coming up with a slick glove save to stop Patrick Kane on a 2-on-1 and making a left pad save to stop Nick Schmaltz on a breakaway.\n\nAho's winner came after he took a pass at the blue line, then skated in before drifting across the net and beating Ward with a wrist shot. Ward had stopped Aho on a breakaway earlier in the game and he wanted another shot at his former teammate.\n\n\"I got the second chance and I saw (Ward) going down and it was east-west and I knew he had to move,\" Aho said.\n\nFor Ward, it was a tough end to his first game as a visitor in the arena where he won the 2006 Conn Smythe Trophy and hoisted the Stanley Cup.\n\nHe set franchise records with 318 victories, 568 starts and 27 shutouts during 13 seasons with the Hurricanes before he was allowed to leave as a free agent and signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the Blackhawks in July while Carolina opted to give Petr Mrazek a one-year, $1.5 million contract.\n\n\"I think it took me a little bit to calm down,\" Ward said. \"Obviously there were a little bit of nerves coming back, coming back and playing your former team, you so badly want to play well, and I felt like as the game progressed, it got better and better.\"\n\nToews scored the game's first goal with 10:53 left in the first.

The former Pro Bowl safety was one of the few experienced safeties on the team, and for all his faults, the coaches could at least count on him to be in the right spot.\n\nThe second narrative was one of exodus: finally unburdened of the running back triumvirate, Mike McCarthy would be forced to divide the running back reps between two players, not three.\n\nIn each scenario, it looks like Brian Gutekunst trusted his personnel \u2013 and its corresponding depth \u2013 more so than the coaching staff.\n\nThe Aaron Jones effect\n\nThe momentum had already been heading that direction, but even against the Rams McCarthy had been reticent to ride his second-year superstar, instead insisting on a drive-by-drive rotation which inadvertently strips away the concept of momentum.\n\nWith Ty Montgomery out of the picture, it was Aaron Jones\u2019 time to take the bulk of the reps at running back. And did he ever: Jones carried the ball 15 times for 145 yards and two touchdowns, including a 67-scamper. He also corralled three of five targets for 27 yards.\n\nRight guard Byron Bell summarized it plainly: \u201cI played with DeAngelo Williams, I played with (Jonathan) Stewart, I played with Zeke (Ezekiel Elliot), I played with DeMarco Murray. Out of all those running backs, him and Zeke\u2014no disrespect to none of the other guys because those are some great backs I played with, too\u2014but him and Zeke Elliot are probably the two best backs I\u2019ve ever seen with patience to just hit it, you know? Thirty-three is going to be a great back in this league for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nJones is the real deal, and having a blue-chip workhorse in the final seven games will be key in righting the Packers\u2019 ship.\n\nAaron Rodgers clearly isn\u2019t right, and it\u2019s difficult to figure out why. He\u2019s missing passes he usually makes, and he\u2019s not seeing the field as well he can. Despite a clean game again Sunday, Rodgers left a few too many plays on the field.\n\nLife is easier with the offense operating with Aaron Jones, however. The margin for error for this unit when Rodgers isn\u2019t clicking is too tiny, evidenced by weekly sloppy, inconsistent play.\n\nA dangerous running threat solves a few problems. The first is that it forces defensive coordinators to make decisions. They can load the box and stop the run, but that implies they\u2019re no longer afraid of Rodgers. Or, they keep the boxes light, make passing difficult, and let the Packers advance the football via the running game.\n\nIf and when Rodgers gets hot, coupled with a No. 1 receiver in Davante Adams, a vertical threat (but not one-dimensional) in Marquez Valdes-Scantling, a big-bodied security blanket in Jimmy Graham, and a homerun hitter in Aaron Jones, the Packers can make a lot of noise. They\u2019re close.\n\nJosh Jones quietly reaffirms Gutekunst\u2019s decision\n\nSafety Josh Jones didn\u2019t do anything that said \u201clook at me\u201d on Sunday. But that\u2019s good: after a tumultuous rookie season where he frequently struggled to stick on his assignments or to communicate traveling receivers, Jones has, in the past two weeks, done his job.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret No. 27 is an athletic outlier: he\u2019s built like a small linebacker but moves like a fast safety and has the straight-line speed of a corner.\n\nIn moving on from Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, the theory was that it could result in an \u201caddition by subtraction\u201d situation. Let\u2019s do the math.\n\nThe Packers get a fourth-round, controlled pick from the Washington Redskins for a player whom the Packers had no interest in bringing back.\n\nIn return, the Packers get a faster free safety (Tramon Williams) and a more physical strong safety (Josh Jones) who also fills in the hybrid linebacker role Jermaine Whitehead once filled before Gutekunst cut him.\n\nYes, the level of competition and sample size should be taken into consideration, but the early results are encouraging: this Packers defense is making plays, they\u2019re playing physical, they\u2019re gang tackling, and the coverage is lightyears ahead of what it was last year.\n\nOn Sunday, Jones appeared physical and assignment sound. He was engaged and did not appear to have any misreads, or if he did none that were fatal. If Jones truly has been struggling to conquer the playbook and the cognitive nuances built into said playbook, then kudos to Mike Pettine for establishing a game plan to maximize Jones\u2019 talents. As a former teacher himself, Pettine surely knows how to both motivate and to scaffold his assignments.\n\nIt took Morgan Burnett several years before he mastered Capers\u2019 playbook, but it\u2019s incumbent upon the coaching staff to get some juice out of a contract before it reaches its latter stages where tough decisions with long-term ramifications need to be made.\n\nIt is worth wondering if having Tramon Williams direct traffic on the back end has helped Jones and, in general, the defense. Clinton-Dix wore the communication helmet one game before he was forced to relinquish the duty to Blake Martinez. The degree to which Clinton-Dix could direct traffic on the back end apart from his own responsibilities is unknown \u2013 and something on which we\u2019ll never receive a direct answer \u2013 but Clinton-Dix\u2019s absence and its effect on the defense will be worth tracking through the final seven games.\n\nThough the release of Whitehead was and is somewhat quizzical, Gutekunst needed to move on from Clinton-Dix and Montgomery because, for whatever reason, the coaching staff would not. In his first full season, the new Packers\u2019 GM seems to have an excellent grip on what this roster is and what it is not. He\u2019s not afraid to force the coaching staff\u2019s hand, and so far his conviction is working.", "Brooklyn Nets guard Caris LeVert is tended to after an injury during the second quarter of a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

(Photo: Gerry Pate, AP)\n\nDavid Pearson, a three-time NASCAR Cup champion and winner of 105 races in NASCAR's premier series, died Monday. He was 83.\n\nThe Wood Brothers Racing team announced his death, but details were not immediately available.\n\nPearson advanced from the short tracks of the Carolinas to the fastest superspeedways of NASCAR and was one of the sport's biggest names in the 1960s and 1970s. His Cup win total is second only to Richard Petty, and he won the Cup championship in every season in which he raced for it (1966, '68 and '69).\n\nPearson is survived by three sons, Larry, Ricky and Eddie, all of whom have been involved in NASCAR racing. His wife, Helen Ray, died in 1991.\n\n\"David Pearson\u2019s 105 NASCAR premier series victories and his classic rivalry in the 1960s and \u201970s with Richard Petty helped set the stage for NASCAR\u2019s transformation into a mainstream sport with national appeal,\u201d said NASCAR Chairman and CEO Jim France. \u201cWhen he retired, he had three championships \u2014 and millions of fans. The man they called the \u201cSilver Fox\u201d was the gold standard for NASCAR excellence.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the France Family and everyone at NASCAR, I want to offer sincere condolences to the family and friends of David Pearson, a true giant of our sport.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Pearson and his three main competitors \u2014 Bobby Allison, Cale Yarborough and Petty \u2014 were largely responsible for beginning the process that grew NASCAR from a mostly Southeastern sport into a national phenomenon. Their battles ignited fan interest and partisanship and attracted the early interest of television.\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVE: Pearson's legend still dazzles racing community\n\nThe Pearson-Petty rivalry was electric. They finished one-two in Cup races 63 times, with Pearson winning 33 of those challenges.\n\nPearson and Petty were the stars of perhaps the greatest finish in NASCAR history \u2014 the 1976 Daytona 500. They were racing for the victory on the final lap when their cars touched in turn four, contact that sent both crashing into the outside wall. Both cars came to a stop on the infield grass, but Pearson depressed the clutch in his Mercury during the wreck, keeping the engine running. He chugged across the finish line at about 30 mph to win the race.\n\nPearson's journey to that time and place began at the now-defunct Piedmont Interstate Fairgrounds dirt track in his hometown of Spartanburg, S.C. As a teen-ager, Pearson climbed a tree outside the track fence to watch a race and decided he had discovered his future.\n\nPearson started racing on local short tracks in 1953 and quickly built a reputation as a smart and daring wheelman. His time working in the Whitney textile mill near Spartanburg was over.\n\nHe moved into Cup racing in 1960 and was named rookie of the year. In 1961, car owner Ray Fox offered Pearson a shot in his Pontiac for the World 600 at Charlotte, and Pearson made the most of the opportunity, scoring his first series win. Later, he said he figured he was as good as anyone else on the track.\n\n\"I figure the car didn't know who was driving it,\" he said. \"If they could do it, I could.\"\n\nUnbelievably sad day today after hearing of the passing of (one of) THE ABSOLUTE GREATEST #nascar drivers.

Always gritty, witty and in position at the end when it counted. \u2014 Brad Keselowski (@keselowski) November 13, 2018\n\nPearson won other big-track races at Daytona and Atlanta that season, and his future was set. He went on to win series championships with the Cotton Owens and Holman-Moody teams, then moved to Wood Brothers Racing in the 1970s to form one of the greatest partnerships in the sport's history. In 1973, Pearson won 11 of 18 races in the Woods' No. 21.\n\nMore than a few drivers, including Petty, have described Pearson as the best driver they ever raced against.\n\nPetty released a statement Monday night, praising Pearson and offering condolences to his family:\n\n\"I have always been asked who my toughest competitor in my career was. The answer has always been David Pearson. David and I raced together throughout our careers and battled each other for wins- most of the time finishing first or second to each other.\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't a rivalry, but more mutual respect.

He's a worker ... he's done a good job especially being thrown right into the fire.\"\n\nCapel is spending his first weeks on the job trying to get a feel for a group that has a mixture of holdovers from a team that went winless in the Atlantic Coast Conference last season and a handful of freshmen that are part of his long-term plans to turn the program around.\n\nJohnson is a key part of the process. His athleticism gives the Panthers a dimension they've missed in the backcourt in recent years and he has quickly embraced the up-tempo style Capel is trying to implement.\n\n\"He has an ability to make things happen in the paint,\" Troy coach Phil Cunningham said of Johnson. \"What they're doing offensively really caters to what (he can do). He can do a lot of things.\"\n\nJared Wilson-Frame scored 24 points off the bench for Pitt. Kene Chukwuka added a career-high 13 points for the Panthers and Terrell Brown chipped in 12 as Pitt took a quick lead and spent most of the night fending off a series of mini-runs by the Trojans (1-2).\n\nCapel suspended Wilson-Frame for last week's season opener for a violation of team rules. The Panthers played so capably without Wilson-Frame \u2014 the program's leading scorer last season \u2014 that Capel opted to keep Wilson-Frame out of the starting lineup upon his return, hoping the versatile senior guard could provide some scoring punch off the bench.\n\nWilson-Frame has responded brilliantly. He scored a team-high 20 points in a victory over Virginia Military Institute last Friday and backed it up by knocking down 9 of 15 shots \u2014 including 6 of 10 3-pointers \u2014 as the Panthers held on.\n\n\"I think that he trusts that he's open and if we do things the right way, the ball will get to him,\" Capel said of Wilson-Frame.\n\nJordon Varnado led Troy with 22 points and Alex Hicks added 16 and Troy hung around despite never leading and shooting just 35 percent (22 of 63) from the floor.\n\nThe Trojans have lost two straight, both by single digits on the road against teams from conferences that carry a higher profile than the Sun Belt. Despite the result, Cunningham is impressed with the way his group handled itself.\n\n\"For us this is two of the most physical teams we played all year and we didn't back down a bit,\" he said. \"I just think we learned we can play in a physical setting.\"\n\nTroy just couldn't make a big shot when it needed one. The Trojans finished made just 6 of 21 3-pointers.\n\nThat wasn't an issue for the Panthers. Wilson-Frame knocked down 3-pointers on three consecutive trips midway through the second half as Pitt built a 14-point lead and nursed it the rest of the way.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nTroy: The Trojans, picked to finish fourth in the Sun Belt Conference, will be a handful for league opponents. Troy blocked five shots and refused to bail in the second half after Wilson-Frame got hot.\n\nPitt: Rebounding is going to be an issue all season for the undersized Panthers. Troy was able to hang around for so long despite its shooting issues by crashing the offensive glass. Both teams finished with 37 rebounds but the Trojans had 14 offensive boards, which translated to a 16-5 advantage in second-chance points.\n\n\"We have to do a better job rebounding the ball, especially our guards,\" Capel said. \"We have to gang rebound.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTroy: host Southern Miss on Thursday.\n\nPitt: Welcomes Central Arkansas on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 One solid half of basketball was quite good enough for Bruno Fernando and Maryland in a blowout victory over North Carolina A&T.\n\nFernando had 17 points and 12 rebounds, most of them before halftime, and the Terrapins cruised past the Aggies 82-59 Monday night.\n\nWith Fernando dominating both ends of the court, Maryland (3-0) led 49-25 at the break. The 6-foot-10 sophomore had 14 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in 15 minutes.\n\n\"Bruno, that was probably his best half since he's been here,\" Terrapins coach Mark Turgeon said. \"Against the zone, he didn't let it bother him. And he was tremendous on defense.\"\n\nFernando picked up two fouls in the opening minute of the second half and remained on the bench with three fouls for nearly 10 minutes before returning to finish his fourth career double-double.\n\n\"It was disappointing for Bruno because he was really on his way to just a monster game,\" Turgeon said. 'It could have been 15, 16 rebounds and 20-some points \u2014 against a zone.\"\n\nFernando took consolation in having a heck of a half.\n\n\"The guys were doing a great job of finding me open. I was doing a great job rebounding, trying to get second-chance points,\" he said. \"With those two fouls, I just went to the bench and tried to stay dialed in the game.\"\n\nThe Aggies had no defense \u2014 literally \u2014 for Fernando and 6-foot-10 Jalen Smith in the middle.\n\n\"The game of basketball is all about matchups, and this was a bad matchup for us,\" coach Jay Joyner said.\n\nAaron Wiggins scored 14 points, Anthony Cowan and Darryl Morsell each had 13 and Smith added 12 points for the Terrapins.\n\nTurgeon went deep in his bench, but still wasn't pleased watching Maryland outscored 34-33 over the final 20 minutes.\n\n\"We did a lot of great things in that first half,\" Turgeon said. \"Second half, we weren't mentally tough enough to sustain it.\"\n\nTwelve different players scored for the Aggies (0-3), led by Kameron Langley with nine. NC A&T shot 39 percent and was outrebounded 45-30.\n\nJoyner was most displeased with a first half in which the Aggies had four assists and eight turnovers.\n\n\"They weren't sharing the basketball. I call it hero basketball,\" Joyner said. \"And hero basketball is going to get you beat 95 percent of the time, especially when you're playing a Power 5 school.\"\n\nThe Terrapins led 13-10 before a three-point play by Fernando sparked a 16-3 run. The surge was capped by Smith, who dunked at the end of a fast break at the outset of a three-point play.\n\nMaryland's 11 offensive rebounds before halftime matched the number of defensive rebounds by the Aggies.\n\nThe Terps led 59-33 with 16:21 left, let the margin dwindle to 18 with just over eight minutes to go and coasted to the finish.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nThe Aggies' tight zone dared Maryland to shoot from the outside, and the Terps took the offer.\n\nMaryland went 10 for 30 from beyond the arc after going 7 for 42 in its first two games.\n\n\"This is the best we've played in our first three games, so we're heading the right way,\" Turgeon said.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nNC A&T: The Aggies understand that early-season games like this one are very difficult to win, but the lessons learned from playing a Big Ten team on the road could pay off when it's time to start play in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference.\n\nMaryland: With six freshmen and three sophomores, the Terrapins need games like this to learn how to work in unison and play to each other's strengths. That's what happened here, as Maryland notched 24 assists (on 31 baskets) and got ample contributions from role players who may be needed when the competition gets tougher.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNC A&T: The Aggies stay on the road against Hofstra on Wednesday night.\n\nMaryland: The Terps host Hofstra on Friday night.

Pearson's win was his third consecutive in the Daytona summer race. (Photo: Bill Hudson, AP)\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This story was originally published on Feb. 1, 2015\n\nSPARTANBURG, S.C. \u2014 The Big Four. Richard Petty, Cale Yarborough, Bobby Allison and David Pearson.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, they built the foundation and set the standards for stock car racing as it is known today. They established the records while banging fenders and sparking fan fights in the grandstands, all the while showing the way for the dramatic NASCAR expansion that was to come.\n\nAll would race into the NASCAR Hall of Fame with ease, and all live vividly in the memories of many racing fans who came of age during their glory days.\n\nIn December, the oldest of the group, Pearson, turned 80. Petty and Allison are 77. Yarborough is 75. Key representatives of what is one of the nation's youngest professional sports, they ride gently now, the hard roads long gone.\n\nMany who saw Pearson race in the old days when dirt tracks often were little more than bulldozer-trimmed backlots on the bad side of town would never have predicted 80 candles on his birthday cake.\n\nPearson was born Dec. 22, 1934 in the Whitney mill village near Spartanburg, a small town in northwestern South Carolina. It served as a hub city for Southeastern railroads, later became a textile manufacturing center and, in the last half of the 20th century, gained national \u2014 and often international \u2014 exposure as the home of one of the greatest automobile racers ever. Spartanburg would see few \u2014 if any \u2014 other sporting figures of Pearson's stature born in its environs.\n\nHe raced at NASCAR's highest level for 27 years. He retired in 1989 after winning Cup championships in 1966, '68 and '69 and totaling 105 victories with a race schedule that was small in comparison to the only man (Petty, with 200) who won more races. Pearson ran 574 races in his career; Petty raced 1,184 times.\n\nPearson once won 11 of 18 races in a season (1973), took the checkered flag ever so slowly in the greatest finish in NASCAR history (the Daytona 500 in 1976), was chosen as the Driver of the Century (the 20th) by a select group of NASCAR voters and built a large fan following.\n\nUntil recent health problems knocked him for a loop, Pearson looked like a man at least 20 years younger.\n\nPearson suffered an abdominal aneurysm in October and was hospitalized for more than a week. His recovery was slowed when he suffered what family members described as a mild stroke Dec. 9. Movement on his left side was impaired, but, according to the family, he is undergoing therapy and recovering well.\n\nSome call Pearson the greatest stock car driver ever. Others might argue the point, and it is an issue that can't be solved by statistics and percentages. But to watch Pearson in his championship years with the Cotton Owens and Holman-Moody teams and later in his peak seasons with Wood Brothers Racing was to see a driver who was perhaps more natural in his environment than any other racer in stock car racing history.\n\nHe became known as the Silver Fox \u2014 both for great late-race strategy and for his premature gray hair.\n\n\"He could sense what was going to happen and be ready for it,\" said Leonard Wood, Pearson's crew chief during his 1972-79 run with the Wood Brothers team and a NASCAR star and Hall of Famer himself. \"A lot of drivers drive no further than the end of the hood and don't see the danger ahead of them. He could figure out a lap ahead where drivers were going to be and what kind of trouble they were about to get in.\"\n\nMaintaining his Spartanburg roots\n\nNow, he's a fox in winter. The first of the Big Four to reach a ninth decade.\n\nThe retired Pearson had a routine before his recent health issues. He typically worked out at the Spartanburg YMCA in early morning, returned home to check the mail, had lunch with one or more local pals at one of his favorite local eateries, then did what he wanted the rest of the day.\n\nMixed in with the bills and checks in the daily mail at Pearson's modest ranch-style home north of Spartanburg are requests for autographs. They arrive from every state and several foreign countries, some addressed simply to \"David Pearson, Race Car Driver, Spartanburg, S.C.\" This more than 25 years after he last drove a major-league race car.\n\nHe sorts the mail on a small desk in the house he bought in 1977. He never moved to the \"big\" house favored by so many other successful athletes. The Pearson home is located on a former peach farm, so there's plenty of room for a large racing shop and several other outbuildings \u2014 one an old country store that holds many of his racing trophies.\n\nPearson's Spartanburg-era disciples form a circle of loyalty. They meet him for lunch, walk with him at the YMCA, take Sunday afternoon spins on their motorcycles. Always, he is the center of it all, the reason they gather but seldom the rambunctious partier. Pearson doesn't drink alcohol (\"Too expensive,\" he says, among other things) and hasn't smoked since the heart of his racing days.\n\nPearson scored his first Cup win in the 1961 World (now Coca-Cola) 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. It was an upset of sorts, and it came with some heroics. The right rear tire on Pearson's Pontiac exploded as he approached the white flag with the lead, and he finished the race riding on the remains of the tire. His portion of the Charlotte winnings totaled $12,000, a huge sum in those days.\n\nThe friends who travel these days with Pearson \u2014 those who share his practical jokes and banter, the ones who will defend his hero status to the last one standing \u2014 will tell you that he hasn't spent any money since then. Pearson and five friends visited Las Vegas last year for a week of fun and frolic, and post-trip estimates were that he spent a maximum of $100.\n\nPHOTOS: David Pearson's racing career\n\nThe money flowed as Pearson reached a high level of success in the big leagues of racing, and he took advantage of his fame to add to his bank account, accepting \"appearance\" money to drive Late Model cars at short tracks around the country. He was a big drawing card \u2014 the NASCAR superstar racing against the top locals.\n\nSuch was the situation at tiny Hartsville-Darlington Speedway in South Carolina during a race weekend at the nearby Darlington Raceway Cup Series track in 1981. Pearson and Dale Earnhardt Sr. were the visiting headliners for the race, which drew a big crowd because of their presence.\n\nPearson sat in his truck in the infield as the public-address announcer made the call for the competing drivers to report to their cars. He didn't move. There were two more announcements. Still, Pearson sat.\n\nOnly when the track promoter showed up with cash in hand \u2014 Pearson's appearance money \u2014 did he report to his race car.\n\nPearson has been smart with his money, investing in land and rental properties while avoiding the sort of wild spending that often accompanies new wealth. He and his late wife, Helen, raised three sons \u2014 Larry, Ricky and Eddie, and all three drove Pearson-family race cars, but Pearson didn't drop a load of money into his racing operations. Larry won two Busch Series (now Xfinity) championships. Ricky is crew chief for Spartanburg Xfinity driver Jeremy Clements, and Eddie also works for the team.\n\nChoosing David Pearson's No. 1 fan is a task fraught with danger. His minions are spread far and wide and are still very much a force all these years down the racing road. But an argument can be made for Alabama resident Russell Branham, who has been a Pearson follower for 46 of his 49 years, named his son for Pearson and, in 2011, inducted Pearson into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.\n\nBranham was 3 years old when he met Pearson, who had landed his small plane at Branham's Airport \u2014 operated by Rudy Branham, Russell's uncle \u2014 in Darlington, S.C., for a Darlington Raceway weekend. Pearson stopped to talk to the young boy, and a hero was born.\n\n\"I remember as a child being mesmerized by that white car and the gold foil number (21), going to races with my uncle and seeing that race car and being able to see the man himself when he would fly his plane to my uncle's airport,\" Branham said. \"That was all overwhelming for a child. We'd go to races, and if the 21 car had problems or fell out, I was ready to leave. The rest of it didn't matter to me.\"\n\nWhen he was 22 years old, Branham was hired as a sports writer for the Florence (S.C.) Morning News. He covered races at Darlington, Charlotte and Rockingham, N.C., all the while deepening his relationship with Pearson and the Pearson family. Then, in 1988, he was named public relations director for Pearson's racing team, which ran Larry on the Busch Series circuit. It was a dream job.\n\n\"The man achieved so much success and was such a talent, but when you visit him he never talks about racing, has never said he was the best,\" said Branham, now public relations director at Talladega Superspeedway. \"He's a very simple, good man who just happened to be an extremely good race car driver.\"\n\nBranham was at Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee March 20, 2010 for one of the low points in the Pearson family racing story. Larry and David Pearson were participating in an old-timers race on the deceptively fast track. Larry's car slid sideways in a turn and was hit by the car of Charlie Glotzbach.\n\nIt was clear immediately that the wreck was a bad one. Branham and Ricky Pearson, who had been watching the race from pit road, ran to the crash site. Larry was briefly unconscious and woke up in extreme pain. The wreck left him with a fractured pelvis and severe hand and ankle injuries.\n\nThe race was stopped, and the Pearsons soon gathered at a nearby hospital, where Larry would undergo surgery. Months of tough rehabilitation followed.\n\n\"Before the race, I had given Larry some chewing gum in a green pack,\" Branham said. \"He told me, 'You know, if something happens to me today it's your fault (green is considered an unlucky color by many racers).' At the hospital, we all went in to see him before the surgery. He looked up at me and called me a bad name. 'This is all your fault,' he said. It was hilarious.\n\n\"David was visibly shaken. ... I think Larry's wreck drew all of them closer than they ever had been.\"\n\nRespect from rivals, owners\n\nIt was not the first time David Pearson had faced tough family issues. In 1989, Helen was diagnosed with cancer. She died two years later, spending most of that time at home with David at her side. Pearson's wide world shrank to the confines of the home.\n\n\"David told me that's the hardest thing he ever went through,\" said Danny Pearson, David's younger cousin. \"A lot of people don't understand that side of David. He's always going on and joking around, but deep down I'd put David's heart against anybody's.\"\n\nAlthough he has been described as basically shy, stoic and subdued, Pearson hasn't been able to camouflage a deep desire to win, to be the best.\n\nThis was the marvelous nature of Pearson's racing career. He saw absolutely no need to lead every lap \u2014 just the important ones, in particular the last. In many of his 105 Cup wins, he floated in the background for 90 percent of the race, only to charge toward the front with 25 laps to go.\n\nHe proved repeatedly that the race is not always to the swift.\n\nPearson often has given credit for late-race advances to Leonard Wood, his crew chief, saying Wood made car changes or tire choices that made the No. 21 better and faster as races progressed. Wood deflects credit to Pearson, saying the driver would spend the first three-quarters of a race preserving his equipment and gauging the strengths of his competitors before breezing past them in the twilight laps.\n\n\"The rest of us, we couldn't stand to be back there in fifth or 10th when we knew the car could be leading,\" said Hall of Famer Bobby Allison. \"David could. He had taken care of his car and protected his tires, and so his car was really way better to go those final laps than the rest of our cars were.\"\n\nPHOTOS: 2015 NASCAR Hall of Fame inductees\n\nPetty, one of the most decorated drivers in motorsports history, often has called Pearson the best driver he raced against.\n\n\"He was one of the most relaxed drivers ever,\" Petty said. \"He just went out and did his thing. He didn't drive on adrenalin. Bobby and Cale did, but that was their personalities. Pearson was relaxed. He had confidence that he could do whatever he needed to do. He didn't have to strain to drive.\"\n\nAcross their careers, Pearson and Petty finished one-two in Cup races 63 times. Pearson won 33 of those.\n\nOf the many times Petty and Pearson met on racing's high ground, none is more memorable than their spectacular finish in the 1976 Daytona 500. They were first and second roaring into the fourth turn of the final lap as a Daytona crowd and an ABC television audience sat enthralled.\n\nTheir cars collided exiting the fourth turn, and the impact sent both smashing into the outside wall. Petty's car spiraled along the frontstretch before stalling on the grassy area separating the track from pit road. Pearson also looped onto the grass \u2014 with one big difference. He had the presence of mind to engage his car's clutch, thus keeping the engine alive.\n\nWhile Petty struggled to restart his engine, Pearson chugged back onto the track and crossed the finish line at about 30 mph to score his first (and only) Daytona 500 win.\n\nPandemonium reigned. As Pearson drove his battered Mercury along pit road toward victory lane, Maurice Petty, Richard's brother and the team's engine builder, ran alongside Pearson's car, apparently thinking Pearson had wrecked Petty intentionally.\n\n\"Maurice and Dale (Inman, Petty's crew chief) came out and about threatened to whip us like we had something to do with it,\" said Glen Wood, the No. 21 team owner (another Hall of Famer). \"I think somebody finally told Maurice it wasn't David's fault. Richard admitted later on that he just wasn't clear. He thought David would back out, and David didn't.\"\n\nEvery day he arrived at a race track, Pearson took everything in stride. \"He was supposed to win,\" Eddie Wood, Glen's son and now one of the team's co-owners, said. \"That's always \u2014 always \u2014 how he looked at it.\"\n\nAfter his recent health issues, Pearson's sons revealed that they would be taking the keys to his new truck, concerned that it wasn't safe for one of the country's greatest drivers to drive. \"I'll just go buy another one,\" Pearson said.\n\nEddie and Len Wood are about 20 years younger than Pearson, who was the team's driver as they began taking more active roles in the No. 21 operations.\n\n\"We'd look forward every morning to him coming to the track just so we could talk to him,\" Len said. \"Whatever he said was gold. We believed it. He was our hero.\n\n\"Still is.\"\n\nFollow Hembree on Twitter @mikehembree", "", "Indianapolis Colts head coach Frank Reich watches from the sideline during the second half of an NFL football game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Indianapolis, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018. (AP Photo/Darron Cummings) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Indianapolis Colts' season looked lost in early October.\n\nAt 1-5, they were better positioned for the draft than the playoffs. A defense that showed so much promise in the first three weeks gave up 37 or more points over the next three. Andrew Luck's short, quick throws created debate over whether his surgically repaired right shoulder was \u2014 or ever would be \u2014 back to full strength.\n\nThree straight wins have changed a lot.\n\nSuddenly, the Colts trail division leader Houston by just two games, have slowly moved back into the wild-card chase, face only one more team with more than five wins at home against Houston (6-3) on Dec. 9. With momentum and hope restored in Indy, there's no telling how this might end.\n\n\"That's not a good question to ask a perfectionist,\" coach Frank Reich said Monday when asked if the offense could play more efficiently.\n\n\"It's never good enough. But it's been pretty good. It's funny how we're wired in this business. This business can humble you in a second and the moment we think we can throw it out there and score 30 points in a minute is the time we get embarrassed.\"\n\nReich's comments explain why he refused to panic when many things \u2014 including his decision to go for the win in an overtime loss to Houston \u2014 seemed to backfire.\n\nIt's also the reason he views Sunday's 29-26 victory over Jacksonville with mixed feelings.\n\nHe was thrilled to see Luck finding open receivers throughout the first half as Indy scored on four its first six possessions and excited to look at a stat sheet that showed the Colts' defense limited the Jaguars' usually strong ground game to just 91 yards and 2.7 yards per carry.\n\nStill, he understands Indy (4-5) must continue improving to continue winning.\n\nThe offense only produced two first downs in the second half, preventing the Colts from sealing the victory until finally forcing a fumble after Jacksonville had moved into position for a potentially tying field goal with 90 seconds left in the game. They only got the ball back after a booth review barely beat Jacksonville's next snap and the replay review overturned the call on the field.\n\n\"It's sort of like a mixed bag of emotions,\" Luck said after joining Tom Brady and Peyton Manning as the only players with six consecutive games of three or more touchdowns in one season. \"A win, excited, but also a little bit angry on the mistakes I know that I felt like I made and that our offense made.\"\n\nThere are plenty of encouraging signs.\n\nLuck has thrown 21 touchdowns and six interceptions in the past six games with a reduced workload on his shoulder. He's increasingly exploited the mismatches between Indy's versatile tight ends, hooking up with them on five TD passes over the past two weeks.\n\nPerhaps most important: Indy's rebuilt offensive line has kept Luck upright. He's been sacked 10 times in nine starts after going down 156 times in his first 70 games, and Luck's streak of four straight games and 184 consecutive sacks are the longest of his pro career.\n\nThey've played well enough that Reich is expanding the play calls.\n\n\"It gives us a lot of confidence to call anything we want, to call stuff down the field,\" he said. \"There's not a play that gets called that we don't think protection first.\"\n\nDefensively, things look better, too.\n\nThe Colts generally have created a pass rush though they failed to even hit Blake Bortles on his 38 attempts Sunday, and they've proved stouter against the run than in previous seasons.\n\nIf they keep it up, Reich knows anything is possible. Another home win next Sunday against Tennessee would give the Colts a four-game winning streak, a share of second place in the AFC South and perhaps even better odds in the playoff race.\n\n\"It's not easy, obviously, to win three in a row, especially coming off of a bye,\" Reich said. \"But we really want to make a statement in these games we have at home. We want to get the excitement back in the building.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Mark Konezny, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe end of an error has come in Buffalo.\n\nIn what seemed like an inevitable decision, the Bills announced they were releasing second-year quarterback Nathan Peterman on Monday night.\n\nHis brief tenure might go down as one of the most infamous, at least in terms of on-field performance, in NFL history. A fifth-round pick out of Pitt in 2017, Peterman played in eight games, starting four. The Bills won only one time when he graced the field, a 13-7 victory over Indianapolis in blizzard conditions last December. And Peterman didn\u2019t finish that contest, relieved by Joe Webb after he suffered a concussion.\n\nMonday marks 51 weeks since Peterman made his starting debut, an infamous decision by head coach Sean McDermott \u2014 he\u2019d benched veteran Tyrod Taylor despite Buffalo\u2019s 5-4 record at the time \u2014 given Peterman was picked off five times in the first half of a 54-24 loss to the Chargers. Taylor was back in the lineup in the third quarter of that game in Los Angeles.\n\nWith the exception of the Colts game, when he was suffering from a knee injury, Taylor resumed his starting role for the remainder of the 2017 season and ultimately led the Bills to their first playoff berth of the 21st century.\n\nYet Taylor was traded in the offseason, creating another opportunity for Peterman to play while first rounder Josh Allen acclimated to the NFL. Again, it didn\u2019t go well.\n\nPeterman threw five interceptions in two starts this season, a 47-3 loss at Baltimore on opening day \u2014 Allen was starting by Week 2 \u2014 and a 41-9 defeat to the Bears on Nov. 4. Peterman tossed a pair of killer picks in Houston on Oct. 14 after relieving Allen, who'd suffered an elbow injury.\n\nPeterman finishes his stint in Western New York having completed 52.3 percent of his passes for 548 yards, three TDs, 12 INTs and a passer rating of 32.5. (An incomplete pass produces a rating of 39.6 for context.) He actually lofted six touchdown passes, but half of them were of the pick-six variety.\n\nPeterman's demise comes a day after journeyman Matt Barkley led the Bills to a 41-10 stampede over the New York Jets, Buffalo's most prolific offensive showing of the season. The team also now has veteran Derek Anderson as an option while Allen's wing heals.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

(Photo: Gerry Pate, AP)\n\nDavid Pearson, a three-time NASCAR Cup champion and winner of 105 races in NASCAR's premier series, died Monday. He was 83.\n\nThe Wood Brothers Racing team announced his death, but details were not immediately available.\n\nPearson advanced from the short tracks of the Carolinas to the fastest superspeedways of NASCAR and was one of the sport's biggest names in the 1960s and 1970s. His Cup win total is second only to Richard Petty, and he won the Cup championship in every season in which he raced for it (1966, '68 and '69).\n\nPearson is survived by three sons, Larry, Ricky and Eddie, all of whom have been involved in NASCAR racing. His wife, Helen Ray, died in 1991.\n\n\"David Pearson\u2019s 105 NASCAR premier series victories and his classic rivalry in the 1960s and \u201970s with Richard Petty helped set the stage for NASCAR\u2019s transformation into a mainstream sport with national appeal,\u201d said NASCAR Chairman and CEO Jim France. \u201cWhen he retired, he had three championships \u2014 and millions of fans. The man they called the \u201cSilver Fox\u201d was the gold standard for NASCAR excellence.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the France Family and everyone at NASCAR, I want to offer sincere condolences to the family and friends of David Pearson, a true giant of our sport.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Pearson and his three main competitors \u2014 Bobby Allison, Cale Yarborough and Petty \u2014 were largely responsible for beginning the process that grew NASCAR from a mostly Southeastern sport into a national phenomenon. Their battles ignited fan interest and partisanship and attracted the early interest of television.\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVE: Pearson's legend still dazzles racing community\n\nThe Pearson-Petty rivalry was electric. They finished one-two in Cup races 63 times, with Pearson winning 33 of those challenges.\n\nPearson and Petty were the stars of perhaps the greatest finish in NASCAR history \u2014 the 1976 Daytona 500. They were racing for the victory on the final lap when their cars touched in turn four, contact that sent both crashing into the outside wall. Both cars came to a stop on the infield grass, but Pearson depressed the clutch in his Mercury during the wreck, keeping the engine running. He chugged across the finish line at about 30 mph to win the race.\n\nPearson's journey to that time and place began at the now-defunct Piedmont Interstate Fairgrounds dirt track in his hometown of Spartanburg, S.C. As a teen-ager, Pearson climbed a tree outside the track fence to watch a race and decided he had discovered his future.\n\nPearson started racing on local short tracks in 1953 and quickly built a reputation as a smart and daring wheelman. His time working in the Whitney textile mill near Spartanburg was over.\n\nHe moved into Cup racing in 1960 and was named rookie of the year. In 1961, car owner Ray Fox offered Pearson a shot in his Pontiac for the World 600 at Charlotte, and Pearson made the most of the opportunity, scoring his first series win. Later, he said he figured he was as good as anyone else on the track.\n\n\"I figure the car didn't know who was driving it,\" he said. \"If they could do it, I could.\"\n\nUnbelievably sad day today after hearing of the passing of (one of) THE ABSOLUTE GREATEST #nascar drivers.

Always gritty, witty and in position at the end when it counted. \u2014 Brad Keselowski (@keselowski) November 13, 2018\n\nPearson won other big-track races at Daytona and Atlanta that season, and his future was set. He went on to win series championships with the Cotton Owens and Holman-Moody teams, then moved to Wood Brothers Racing in the 1970s to form one of the greatest partnerships in the sport's history. In 1973, Pearson won 11 of 18 races in the Woods' No. 21.\n\nMore than a few drivers, including Petty, have described Pearson as the best driver they ever raced against.\n\nPetty released a statement Monday night, praising Pearson and offering condolences to his family:\n\n\"I have always been asked who my toughest competitor in my career was. The answer has always been David Pearson. David and I raced together throughout our careers and battled each other for wins- most of the time finishing first or second to each other.\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't a rivalry, but more mutual respect. David is a Hall of Fame driver who made me better. He pushed me just as much as I pushed him on the track.

We stayed close, and I enjoyed visits to see David when going through South Carolina. We will miss those trips.\n\n\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Pearson family and friends.\"\n\nPearson last raced in the Cup series in 1986 but didn't officially retire until 1989, when recurrent back problems forced the issue.\n\nDavid Pearson\n\nAge: 83\n\nDate of birth: Dec. 22, 1934\n\nNickname: Silver Fox\n\nKey achievements:", "FILE - In this Sunday, Nov. 4, 2018 file photo, Buffalo Bills quarterback Nathan Peterman (2) warms up before an NFL football game against the Chicago Bears in Orchard Park, N.Y.

Barnes, File) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 Nathan Peterman's turnover-over prone days with the Buffalo Bills are over after the second-year player was cut by the team on Monday.\n\nThe move was announced as the Bills (3-7) enter their bye week, and not long after coach Sean McDermott backed Peterman earlier in the day.\n\n\"I'm still confident in Nate,\" he said.\n\nMcDermott's recent decisions, however, did not appear to match his belief in a player who threw seven interceptions in four appearances this season, and 13 overall in nine career games, including a brief playoff stint last season.\n\nPeterman became the odd man out on a team carrying four quarterbacks, and with rookie Josh Allen set to reclaim his starting job after missing four games with a sprained right throwing elbow.\n\nThe Bills are off until they host Jacksonville on Nov. 25.\n\nPeterman was passed on the depth chart by Matt Barkley, who took over the starting job in a 41-10 win over the New York Jets on Sunday. McDermott opted to start Barkley, despite having just signed with Buffalo on Oct. 30, and a week after Peterman \u2014 starting in place of injured veteran backup Derek Anderson (concussion) \u2014 threw three interceptions in a 41-9 loss to Chicago.\n\nBuffalo considered Peterman to be a project in selecting him with a fifth-round pick in the 2017 draft out of Pittsburgh. He spent his final two seasons at Pitt after transferring from Tennessee.\n\nThis year, the 24-year-old went from winning a three-way offseason quarterback competition, which also included AJ McCarron, to being off the team entirely.\n\nHis starting tenure lasted two series into the third quarter, after which he was pulled in favor of Allen in a season-opening 47-3 loss at Baltimore.\n\nThings unraveled further when Peterman took over after Allen was hurt in the third quarter of a 20-13 loss at Houston on Oct. 14. After hitting Zay Jones for a go-ahead touchdown, Peterman closed the game by throwing two interceptions, including one returned for the decisive score in the final two minutes.\n\nHe's best remembered for throwing five interceptions in the first half of his first career start in a 54-24 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers a little under a year ago.\n\nFollowing the loss, McDermott acknowledged to his players he erred in electing to start Peterman ahead of Tyrod Taylor in a bid to spark an underperforming offense in the midst of a two-game skid.\n\nTaylor reclaimed the starting duties the following week, and closed the season 4-2 in helping Buffalo end a 17-season playoff drought, which had been the longest active streak in North America's four major professional sports.\n\nOverall, including playoffs, Peterman went 69 of 133 for 563 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nPeterman maintained an upbeat approach despite his struggles.\n\n\"I'm still here,\" he said, the week leading up to what proved to be his final start against Chicago. \"And every time you're here, every time you step on the field, and you're in this building, I'm always ready. I was ready last week. And I'm going to be ready again this week.\"\n\nHe also didn't shy away from acknowledging his miscues.\n\n\"Mistakes are in the past. I've learned from them. I've taken them to heart. I'll never forget them,\" Peterman said. \"But at the same time, I'll learn from them and move on.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) \u2014 The idea the Seattle Seahawks would score 31 points and lose used to be unfathomable with Pete Carroll in charge.\n\nIt's happened now twice this season, both times to the division-leading Los Angeles Rams. And by the end of the season those two games of being unable to slow down the Rams could end up being the difference between Seattle finding its way into the playoffs and being left home for the second straight year.\n\n\"I'm not a moral victories guy. A loss is a loss,\" Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \"We need to grow from it. It's only good if we learn something from it and do better. We've got to do that. We have to apply that to the rest of the season.\"\n\nSeattle has little time to make corrections with Green Bay visiting on Thursday night in a matchup with major wild-card implications in the NFC. Seattle has dropped two straight, falling to 4-5 and can't afford a third straight loss if it wants to remain in the playoff race.\n\nCarroll believes there is still time for Seattle to make a playoff run. But its defense must improve starting this week.\n\n\"We've got to go. We've got to take these one week at a time and start piling up some wins. I like our style and I like our style in playoff mode. I'd like that opportunity,\" Carroll said on Monday.\n\n\"We've got a lot of ball to play, there are a lot of games coming at us, lot of opportunities at home and we should have nothing but the thoughts that we should build on where we are right now and have a chance to get going and get better. Hopefully we can stay healthy and give us a chance to play with the same guys.\"\n\nFor the second straight week, Seattle was terrible at stopping the run, especially in the first half. A week earlier against the Chargers, it was Melvin Gordon running wild as that Los Angeles franchise rolled up 160 yards rushing and averaged more than 7 yards per carry.\n\nIt didn't get better against Todd Gurley and the Rams. Gurley rushed for 120 yards on just 16 carries and the Rams averaged 6.5 yards per carry. It was the third time this season Seattle has allowed its opponent to average more than 6 yards per rush \u2014 it happened just seven times in the previous eight seasons.\n\n\"We've just got to play better and not allow the big plays to happen,\" Carroll said. \"It's just consistency. That's the common denominator, the consistency at the line of scrimmage.\"\n\nThe Rams are the only team this season to score 30 or more points against the Seahawks, but what was a rarity under Carroll's regime has become more of an issue in the past two years.\n\nFrom the middle of the 2011 season through the end of the 2016 season, the Seahawks allowed 30 or more points eight times, including none in the 2012 season \u2014 a span of 89 games.\n\nIn the past two seasons, including Sunday's 36-31 loss to the Rams, the Seahawks have given up 30 or more points seven times in a span of 25 games.\n\nInjuries can be blamed for some of the problems, but clearly the Seahawks defense is far more vulnerable than they've been in the past.\n\n\"We gave up too many plays, particularly early. It took us a while to zero in on what we needed to do to stop the running game. I really thought that was the key,\" Carroll said. \"They did a nice job again. They continue to just keep rolling on offense and we weren't able to slow them down enough.\"\n\nNOTES: Center Justin Britt declined to comment about a postgame confrontation with Rams' DT Aaron Donald. Donald rushed Britt near midfield at the end of the game and the players had to be separated. ... Carroll was unsure the status of LB K.J. Wright who left Sunday's game with a knee injury. Wright had knee surgery in August that caused him to miss the first six games. ... Carroll said he expects RB Chris Carson and G D.J. Fluker to be able to play against the Packers. Both players sat out Sunday's game in the hope of being able to play against Green Bay.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Richard) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The Atlanta Falcons picked a bad time to play their second-worst game of the year.\n\nLosing by two touchdowns at Cleveland cost the Falcons (4-5) a chance to move one-half game back in the NFC wild-card race. They enter this week's home game against Dallas (4-5) two games behind Carolina for the final playoff spot.\n\nAtlanta looked out of sync most of the day. Only in Week 5 in a blowout loss at Pittsburgh did the Falcons play worse, but quarterback Matt Ryan isn't terribly concerned.\n\n\"There are seven games to go, and we are right in the mix,\" Ryan said. \"Probably the most important part of being a professional is being able to move on. That includes being able to move on from both positive experiences and negative experiences. We can't begin to start feeling sorry for ourselves or anything like that.\"\n\nCoach Dan Quinn told his team Monday that he was satisfied with its effort against the Browns but not much else. There was a palpable lack of speed as the Falcons fell short of reaching \"another spot that you go to, to play really exemplarily ball.\"\n\nTrailing 14-10 and getting the ball to begin the third quarter, Atlanta's next four possessions ended with a fumble, two punts and a failure to score from the 1-yard line early in the fourth when Tevin Coleman was stopped for no gain and Ryan threw an incompletion.\n\nIn between, the Browns scored two touchdowns with Nick Chubb's 92-yard run, the longest in Cleveland history, one of the most embarrassing plays of the season.\n\nLinebacker Duke Riley froze and got blocked by center JC Tretter while right guard Kevin Zeitler pinned Derrick Shelby back at the line of scrimmage. Chubb dashed through the hole and was too fast to catch after free safety Damontae Kazee dove at his feet and whiffed near the Cleveland 22.\n\nThe Browns' 211 yards rushing were the most Atlanta has allowed since Sept. 28, 2014, at Minnesota.\n\n\"It wasn't the outcome we wanted and worked for but we can't dwell on it,\" Riley said. \"We have to move forward like we did with the first couple of losses.\"\n\nThe offense suffered a letdown when center Alex Mack sent a shotgun snap over Ryan's head in the second quarter, causing the Falcons to settle for a field goal. Mohamed Sanu's lost fumble to begin the third was even worse because he held the ball out to get an extra yard and was still 14 yards shy of the first-down marker.\n\nSix plays later, the Browns were dancing in the end zone.\n\n\"We didn't do our jobs the way we were supposed to,\" Sanu said, \"and you saw exactly what happened.\"\n\nQuinn will challenge his players to create more energy in practice this week.\n\n\"I thought over the last couple weeks defensively we knew we had faced some good runners with the Giants and certainly at Washington, and it was going to take that second and third guy jumping over the pile to get there,\" he said. \"I thought offensively we've been hitting it on that stride for a few weeks now.\n\n\"So for us not to find that speed, to create some of the explosive plays and same thing on the defensive side, not to create some of the speeds that create negative plays, those are things that I didn't think was up to our standard.\"\n\nNotes: Quinn said MLB Deion Jones will practice for the second straight week in hopes that he can play against the Cowboys. Jones has been out since breaking his foot in the season-opening loss at Philadelphia. ... It will likely be Thursday before Quinn knows if kicker Matt Bryant will be ready to return from a hamstring injury. Giorgio Tavecchio is 5 for 5 on field goals and has hit all eight of his extra-point tries in playing the past three games in Bryant's spot.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Congress returns to a changed political landscape Tuesday as newly-elected lawmakers arrive in Washington, the parties elect new leadership and incumbents square off for one final legislative sprint before House Democrats take power.\n\nVoters swept away eight years of House Republican control in last week\u2019s election, creating a new political dynamic that\u2019s challenging President Donald Trump even before the new 116th Congress begins in January.\n\nFor their last act, Republicans will try to deliver on Trump\u2019s promise to fund the border wall, which could spark a partial federal government shutdown in weeks. Newly emboldened Democrats are in no mood to cooperate over wall money. Instead, they\u2019ll be pushing to protect special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe from acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who has criticized the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. All sides must agree to a federal funding bill to prevent a partial government shutdown from beginning on Dec. 7.\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats are anything but lame ducks,\u201d Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote Monday to colleagues, saying Democrats are \u201cflying high and taking pride\u201d in the greatest Democratic sweep of the House since the Watergate election of 1974. They picked up at least 32 seats, with several races still undecided.\n\n\u201cWe have great opportunity, and therefore great responsibility to get results for the American people,\u201d Pelosi wrote. Democrats \u201cneed to be unified, find common ground with Republicans in our legislative engagements, but stand our ground when we must.\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, dozens of new House lawmakers and a handful of new senators arrived for a whirlwind orientation session. They will take their official photos, meet colleagues and take what could prove to be the toughest vote of their early careers \u2013 electing their leadership. Several new Congressional Progressive Caucus members held their first press conference Monday.\n\n\u201cI hope that we are ushering in a new era,\u201d said Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.\n\nTheir majority lost, House Republicans will start the task of rebuilding. Retiring Speaker Paul Ryan will begin to transition out of power and next-in-line Kevin McCarthy of California is favored over conservative Rep. Jim Jordan, a leader of the Freedom Caucus, to win the job of incoming minority leader in leadership elections Wednesday. GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana is expected keep his spot unchallenged. And new to leadership will be Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, in the No. 3 position of conference chair.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to change the way that we operate and really in some ways be more aggressive,\u201d Cheney, running unopposed, told The Associated Press.\n\nSenators will also select their leaders, but few surprises are expected. On the Democratic side, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is set to return as leader, even though the party lost several seats in the election.\n\nSchumer suggested Democrats would use the lame duck session to fight to protect special counsel. \u201cPeople are really concerned about this,\u201d Schumer told CNN.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has predicted a \u201clively\u201d lame duck session. He has said legislation to protect Mueller is \u201cunnecessary\u201d because the investigation is \u201cnot under threat.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is poised to again lead Republicans, but term limits are pushing GOP Whip John Cornyn of Texas out of the No. 2 spot, making way for South Dakota Sen. John Thune to move up. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri will round out the team, and Cornyn will still have a seat at McConnell\u2019s table of counselors.\n\nMcConnell is also trying to add a female senator to a lower leadership spot, seeking to address the optics of having an all-male leadership slate in a year that brought a record number of women to Congress.\n\nThe biggest leadership race is Pelosi\u2019s bid to return as the first female House speaker, a contest she says she\u2019s \u201c100 percent\u201d confident she will win despite a public campaign by some incumbent and newly elected Democrats to oust her. Preliminary voting won\u2019t unfold for House Democrats until after Thanksgiving.\n\nAmid the leadership shuffle, lawmakers have several pieces of legislation they want to finish by year\u2019s end, including a farm policy bill and legislation overhauling Congress\u2019 handling of sexual harassment claims. The Senate will try to confirm more of Trump\u2019s judicial and administrative nominees, including a vote this week on Michelle Bowman to be a member of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors.\n\nBut first they appeared headed toward a showdown over Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump spent weeks ahead of the midterm election rallying fears over a migrant caravan heading toward the border and promised voters that Republicans would bring tougher border security.\n\nHouse Republicans have already approved $5 billion for Trump\u2019s wall, but in the Senate, where Republicans need Democratic support to prevent a filibuster, a bipartisan bill allocates $1.6 billion.\n\nMcCarthy upped the stakes by introducing legislation for the full $25 billion the White House wants in border funds as he tries to shore up support from conservatives ahead of the GOP leadership election.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how hard Republicans will be willing to fight for the wall, given that dozens of House GOP lawmakers are serving their final days in Congress after retiring or losing their re-election races. Ryan had promised a \u201cbig fight\u201d over the border money and McConnell said a mini-shutdown may be necessary to help Trump \u201cget what he\u2019s looking for\u201d on the wall.\n\nRep. Nita Lowey of New York, who is set to chair the House Appropriations Committee, said Democrats \u201chave our boxing gloves on\u201d to spar with Trump and other Republicans.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations panel, Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, on Monday told reporters Trump is the only person in Washington who seems to want to a shutdown.\n\nFirefighters battling California wildfires, police officers and other emergency responders all would be hurt by a shutdown, he said. If Republicans insist that \u201cit\u2019s the wall or nothing, then they are going to get nothing,\u201d Leahy said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/12/116th-congress-arrives-washington-freshmen-orientation/1984248002/", "2011 NASCAR hall of fame inductee David Pearson during a press conference at Daytona International Speedway. (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nDavid Pearson, the NASCAR pioneer known as \"The Silver Fox\" for his cunning craft and a longtime rivalry with Richard Petty, has died. He was 83.\n\nThe Wood Brothers Racing team said Pearson died Monday night in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where he was born and lived most of his life. Details were not immediately available.\n\nPearson was one of NASCAR's first superstars along with Petty, Bobby Allison and Cale Yarborough, and they raced all over the country as the cornerstone during NASCAR's period of slow growth beyond a regional racing series. Pearson was a three-time Cup champion, his 105 career victories trail only Petty's 200 on NASCAR's all-time list, and he was inducted into the second class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame.\n\nPearson's career paralleled Petty's and the two combined for 63 finishes in which they finished first and second to each other. Pearson won 33 of the battles.\n\n\"I have always been asked who my toughest competitor in my career was. The answer has always been David Pearson,\" Petty said late Monday night. \"David and I battled each other for wins, most of the time finishing first or second to each other. It wasn't a rivalry, but more mutual respect. David is a Hall of Fame driver who made me better. He pushed me just as much as I pushed him on the track. We both became better for it.\"\n\nPearson beat Petty in the 1974 Firecracker 500 at Daytona International Speedway when Petty was glued to his bumper on the final lap. Pearson then let off the gas slightly as Petty dropped out of his wake, Petty pulled up alongside Pearson and passed him. With the finish line in sight, Pearson then used a slingshot pass out of the high banked final turn to zip past Petty and snatch the victory.\n\nTwo years later in the Daytona 500, Pearson and Petty collided near the finish line. Both cars slid into the grass, Petty was unable to restart his engine and Pearson got the win when he limped his damaged car across the finish line.\n\nPearson began on the short tracks of the Carolinas, graduated to NASCAR in 1960, and his championships came in the only three seasons \u2014 1966, 1968 and 1969 \u2014 in which he competed in the entire NASCAR schedule.\n\nPearson won titles with the Cotton Owens and Holman-Moody teams, then moved to Wood Brothers Racing in the 1970s to form one of the greatest partnerships in the series' history. Pearson won 11 of 18 races driving the Woods' iconic No. 21 Ford in 1973.\n\nPearson last raced in the Cup series in 1986 but didn't officially retire until 1989, when recurrent back problems forced the issue.\n\n\"David Pearson's 105 NASCAR premier series victories and his classic rivalry in the 1960s and '70s with Richard Petty helped set the stage for NASCAR's transformation into a mainstream sport with national appeal,\" said NASCAR Chairman and CEO Jim France. \"When he retired, he had three championships \u2014 and millions of fans. The man they called the \"Silver Fox\" was the gold standard for NASCAR excellence.\"\n\nPearson is survived by three sons, Larry, Ricky and Eddie, all of whom have been involved in NASCAR racing. His wife, Helen Ray, died in 1991.

(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) \u2014 Matt Patricia wants the Detroit Lions to stay the course.\n\nThe Lions have lost three games in a row \u2014 all by double digits \u2014 and are mired in last place. Their most recent defeat was an ugly one. Detroit fell behind 26-0 in the second quarter and eventually lost 34-22 at Chicago on Sunday.\n\nPatricia's first season as coach has been a disappointment so far, and if he has any easy, quick fixes at his disposal, he wasn't sharing them in his Monday news conference.\n\n\"No time to feel sorry for ourselves,\" Patricia said. \"We have to just keep working and getting better.\"\n\nOffensive lineman Taylor Decker sounded a similar refrain.\n\n\"You've just got to play better,\" Decker said. \"At the end of the day, you've just got to perform better. I know that sounds cliche. It's a simple answer, but it's not easy to do.\"\n\nThe Lions (3-6) lost their first two games of the season, then fought back to a 3-3 mark before this current losing skid. They traded receiver Golden Tate before going on the road to face Minnesota and Chicago, and Detroit never led in either of those games.\n\nThe past two games have been particularly rough from a pass protection standpoint. Detroit allowed 10 sacks against the Vikings and six against the Bears.\n\n\"Whatever the situation is, whatever the score is, we have to play better as an offensive line. We have to protect the quarterback,\" Decker said. \"Six sacks isn't something that's going to be acceptable, and we know that.\"\n\nSo now the Lions are back where they were after those first two losses \u2014 playing catch-up. Only now, they don't have a long season still in front of them. Detroit's next three games are at home, but all are against teams with winning records in Carolina, Chicago and the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe Lions fired special teams coordinator Joe Marciano last week, but Patricia indicated no more staff changes are imminent. He said communication between him and the players is good.\n\n\"I think we understand (that) we're working hard to try to get everything the right way. There's not a big discussion about it, there's not a big confrontation or anything like that. I don't know where any of that really comes from outside the building,\" Patricia said.\n\n\"Inside the building, we're just trying to get better. We really are just working really hard to make sure we're doing the right things and trying to find different ways, if we have to, to get those things done.\"\n\nDetroit went 9-7 last season and then fired coach Jim Caldwell, so that makes the decline in 2018 even more alarming. Quarterback Matthew Stafford turned 30 earlier this year, and although the Lions traded Tate \u2014 a potential free agent at season's end \u2014 for a draft pick, this franchise doesn't seem as if it's in a rebuilding mode.\n\nThat means the rest of this season is significant. Whether they make the playoffs or not, the Lions need to show some progress \u2014 some reason for fans to trust that this roster and this coach are better than what the team has shown so far.\n\n\"I believe in this team and we're going to work real hard every single day,\" Patricia said. \"I think the guys in that room, I have a great understanding of what they are and what we're going to do as a team. We're not hitting the panic button or anything like that right now. We're just trying to get better.\"\n\nNOTES: P Sam Martin didn't go into much detail about the medical issue that sent him to the hospital, other than to say he's fine and will play this coming weekend.

Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom both condemned Trump's remarks while continuing to press for a major disaster declaration from the White House.\n\n\u201cManaging all the forests everywhere we can does not stop climate change \u2013 and those that deny that are definitely contributing to the tragedy,\u2019\u2019 Brown told Politico on Sunday. \u201cThe chickens are coming home to roost.

Last summer, Trump wrote a tweet surmising that California firefighters weren't getting access to water to fight fires because of environmental laws.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Nov. 9, 2018, as they travel to Paris.

And instead of cleaning it up, they don\u2019t touch them. I think California ought to get their act together and clean up their forests and manage their forests.\"\n\nA review of all 55 Twitter accounts belonging to California senators and U.S. House members showed no one defending the president's tweet.\n\nOne California Republican, Rep.

Brad Sherman, who called the president's threatening tweet \"abhorrent and an abdication of leadership in a time of crisis.

Warriors spokesperson Lisa Goodwin said the team plans to sell 200 passes each month, starting with November, and that the pass will automatically renew each month through April, as the offer is not being extended to the postseason.\n\nSo yeah, if you want to pay $100 bucks a month and then overpay for some arena food and drinks while watching the game on TV then this plan is for you!\n\nBut if you\u2019re a normal person you\u2019ll probably just give this a quick laugh and pass on the \u201copportunity.\u201d", "HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Starter Dallas Keuchel has declined the one-year qualifying offer the Houston Astros offered him.\n\nKeuchel could still sign with the Astros, but if he signs with another team before next year's draft the Astros will receive a compensation draft pick in the 2019 draft.\n\nMonday was the deadline for players who received qualifying offers to accept or decline them.\n\nKeuchel, the 2015 American League Cy Young winner, was drafted by the Astros in 2009 and has spent his entire career in Houston.\n\nHe went 12-11 with a 3.74 ERA in an AL-leading 34 starts last season and is 76-63 with a 3.66 ERA in 192 games in his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hander's best season came the year he won the Cy Young when he won a career-high 20 games with a career-low 2.48 ERA in 33 starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.
