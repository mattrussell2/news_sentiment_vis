Earlier this year, Pallister cancelled another deal between the three parties, worth $67 million.\n\nOn Saturday, Pallister reiterated his position that the Turning the Page deal was really a payoff to prevent the MMF from speaking out against Manitoba Hydro projects such as the Bipole III transmission line and Keeyask generation project.\n\n\"I have too much respect for Metis people to continue the old outdated approach the previous government used, of paying them to be silent,\" Pallister said, adding the money involved in the deal represents only \"a small fraction of the relationship\" with the Metis people.\n\nThe premier expressed similar sentiments with regard to a carbon tax. Although he continues to believe the federal government has unfairly judged Manitoba's green plan on the absence of a price on carbon, he said it hasn't poisoned the relationship between the two levels of government.\n\n\"We have disagreement on the carbon tax issue, but we agree and are working together on housing issues, agricultural policy, vulnerable children, many, many other issues.\"\n\nPallister also said it's still too premature to say whether or not the province will follow Ontario's lead and intervene in Saskatchewan's court reference case, challenging the federal government's right to impose a carbon tax on provinces that don't comply with its climate change plan.\n\nIf his government does decide to intervene, Pallister said the case would be strengthened by what he called \"a tremendous, focused effort on getting a green plan for Manitoba\" as well as the \"billions of dollars\" already invested in such efforts.\n\n\"Should we be forced to go to court, I guess I would say we have a better case than other provinces do, to defend ourselves and make sure we have control over how we maintain our green reputation and how we strengthen it.\"\n\nWith files from Gavin Boutroy", "A ceremony to honour Candace Stevens was held Sunday at a location close to where her remains were found a week ago.\n\nIt is a way to help her cross over to the spirit world said Tulley Paul, a traditional healer from the Metepenagiag First Nation.\n\n\"It's very important for the family and her relatives and all the communities that we honour her spirit this way out of respect for her and her spirit.\n\n\"It has to be done this way to release her spirit.\"\n\nStevens' body was found on the Warwick Road in Upper Derby, a community close to the First Nation communities of Metepenagiag and Natoaganeg.\n\nHer identity was confirmed by friends after Fredericton police and RCMP said they were investigating the death of a 31-year-old Fredericton woman.\n\nIn the days following the discovery, Malcolm Ward, who organized the ceremony, said he was troubled by the rumours being posted on social media sites.\n\nSocial media confusion\n\n\"It was a big social media confusion of what was going on and about what happened up here.

That's when he wasn't busy escaping from jail \u2014 twice.\n\nThe almost-mythical criminal pedigree of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who was extradited in 2017 to face U.S. drug conspiracy charges, has sparked security concerns at his upcoming New York City trial that at times have drawn as much attention as the case's sensational allegations.\n\nA look at those concerns for a trial that is starting Monday with jury selection. Opening statements are likely Nov. 13.\n\nFears for witnesses\n\nProsecutors say Guzman was in the habit of ordering the killings of anyone who got in his way during his heyday in Mexico as boss of the Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nIn his way now is a lineup of government witnesses who survived the wave of violence and are expected to give details about the ruthless way he kept power for 20 years in the cutthroat world of international drug trafficking. The defence says the witnesses are the true bad guys whose testimony shouldn't be trusted.\n\nThe names of the witnesses have been blacked out on court documents, with prosecutors saying their identities need to be protected because their co-operation could put them in the crosshairs of a vengeful cartel. According to court papers, some are being held in special jail units for their protection, while others are in witness protection programs.\n\nA poster with the face of Mexican drug lord Guzman, reading 'Wanted, Again' is displayed at a newsstand in one Mexico City's major bus terminals on July 13, 2015, a day after the government released news of the escape of the drug kingpin from a maximum-security prison. (Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe list of people who could turn up on the witness stand is long. Two standout possibilities are twin brothers Pedro and Margarito Flores, former Chicago-based narcotics wholesalers who did business with Guzman before their arrest in 2008. They agreed to co-operate and record phone conversations with Guzman about the size of shipments smuggled on boats and airplanes.\n\nIn one, a voice identified as Guzman's asks, \"How much can you get rid of in a month?\"\n\nThe now imprisoned brothers paid a steep price for flipping: Prosecutors say in 2009 their father was murdered in Mexico by a cartel hit team.\n\nFortifying the courthouse\n\nAt pretrial hearings leading to the trial, heavily armed federal officers and bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled outside. Anyone trying to attend the hearings was put through airport-style metal detectors at the courthouse entrance and at the door of the courtroom itself.\n\nThe judge also agreed with prosecutors that the jury for the case should be kept anonymous, a measure typical in terrorism or mob cases where jury intimidation is a concern.\n\nNo one's hiding the ominous nature of the case from potential jurors. Questions for them on an initial screening form ask if they've ever heard of \"El Chapo\" along with, \"Have you, or has anyone close to you, ever felt fearful of or threatened by people who you thought were associated with drug crimes?\"\n\nJurors also will be escorted to and from the courthouse by federal officers and sequestered from the public while inside. As a reason, the judge cited prosecutors' contention that Guzman's cartel \"employs 'sicarios,' or hit men, who carried out hundreds of acts of violence, including murders, assaults and kidnappings.\"\n\nWatchful eyes\n\nAfter Guzman was brought to New York, authorities here decided he should be housed in solitary confinement in a high-security wing of a federal jail in Manhattan that has held notorious terrorists and mobsters.\n\nCentral to that calculation was Guzman's history of giving directions to his lieutenants from Mexican jails and credentials as a two-time escapee there. The second time was via a 1.6 kilometre-long tunnel dug to the shower in his cell.\n\nA woman paints the name of a victim of the Mexican drug war onto a body outline as part of a memorial for those killed, on the 10th anniversary of the drug war's start, at the Monument for the Mexican Revolution, in Mexico City, Sunday, Dec. 11, 2016.

He said there would be adjustments, but didn't elaborate.\n\nThere's now speculation that a special cell for Guzman has been set up in the bowels of the courthouse where he will spend the nights after his days in court.\n\nBut no one is saying.

Senater is also the owner and proprietor of The Depanneur, a popular breakfast and lunch spot on College Street that provides the space and logistical support for Newcomer Kitchen.\n\nEvery Wednesday, between six and eight Syrian refugees prepare 50 traditional meals that are made available for pickup to anyone with an appetite. The meals can also be delivered for free through Foodora, though only within three kilometres of The Depanneur.\n\nCooks from 80 different families take turns each week, and the money earned goes back to the women who prepared the meals. To date, Senater estimates the program has put provided up to $120,000 for the families who participated so far.\n\nFor the first time this month, the meals will be available for pickup or delivery from three other locations spread across Toronto. The Centre for Social Innovation Annex, Paintbox Bistro in Regent Park and The 519 in the Church-Wellesley area will each be a pickup spot for the meals.\n\nThe idea is that the new locations will help expose more neighbourhoods to the program and allow more people than ever to enjoy real Syrian food. The partnerships are meant to serve as a \"proof of concept\" that could serve as a model for similar initiatives.\n\n\"It's intended to be a model for any newcomer community, in any kitchen willing to open its doors, in any city of the world,\" Senater explained in an interview on Sunday.\n\nFor now, all the prep work and cooking will still be done at The Depanneur because of the immense logistical challenges involved in preparing 50 meals.\n\nThe partnerships are set to run through December, though Senater hopes it will become a more permanent feature of Newcomer Kitchen. They could also prove essential to the longevity of the project itself.\n\nFinancing a constant 'struggle'\n\nThe Depanneur faces a 60 per cent rent hike at the end of the year, according to Senater. The financial reality of that sudden increase has put the future viability of the whole initiative at risk.\n\n\"It's been a real struggle to keep afloat already,\" Senater said.\n\nPart of the motivation for rotating meal pickups to the other locations is so Senater and his staff at The Depanneur can use the kitchen space on Wednesdays for events that generate revenue. At this point, every dollar earned is critical, he said.\n\nNewcomer Kitchen depends almost entirely on crowdfunding campaigns, fundraising drives and sponsorships.\n\n\"It's gotten a lot of national and international attention, but it's yet to receive any sort of official funding in any way,\" Senater said.\n\nThe women prepare 50 meals a week of traditional Syrian food. The meals are available for pickup or through delivery for free via Foodora, if you live within three kilometres of The Depanneur. (CBC)\n\nSecuring a consistent source of money was the impetus behind incorporating as a non-profit. But finding funding has proven to be more elusive than anyone thought.\n\n\"I had imagined it would be more straightforward given the obvious win-win of this idea,\" said Senater. Navigating the bureaucracy has become like a full-time job, he added.\n\n\"The large print giveth, and the fine print taketh away,\" he joked.\n\nFor the complete list of locations and dates for meal pickups, click here.", "Four people are in hospital after a pit bull attack at a residence in Colwood, west of Victoria, on Saturday.\n\nAccording to a release from RCMP, West Shore RCMP and the BC Ambulance Service were called to a residence in the 3000 block of Pickford Road in Colwood at 12:30 a.m.\n\nEmergency responders discovered 13 people \u2014 including adults and children \u2014 barricaded inside the residence following an attack by a pit bull.\n\nThe dog's owner, Kyla Johnson, managed to secure the dog inside a bedroom but sustained serious injuries, including bite wounds.\n\nJohnson said her father and fianc\u00e9 were arguing and the dog became agitated.\n\nJohnson said she suffered injuries on her arms, legs, knees, chest and stomach.\n\nShe said she adopted the dog, Rex, from Vancouver in July.\n\nOwner says no history of violence\n\nThe Capital Regional Animal Control officer and police were eventually able to safely remove the dog.\n\nAccording to the statement from RCMP, an injured man who appeared to be heavily intoxicated, was also arrested by police after \"removing his shirt and attempting to fight with officers.\"\n\n\"CRD Animal Control officers have seized the pit bull who had been recently adopted by the family as a rescue animal,\" Cpl.

The Kings have been outscored 45-28, but they had won two of their past three games following a six-game losing streak.\n\n\"I'm looking to get the compete and the passion back,\" Blake said after announcing his second coaching change in 19 months. \"We need our players emotionally involved. It's difficult to win when you're not. We expect Willie to bring that passion and that excitement to this team.\"\n\nBevy of top-end talent\n\nThe Kings beat Columbus 4-1 on Saturday in Stevens' final game in charge, but Blake decided to make his second coaching change in 19 months after the team's terrible start.\n\nThe Kings still have a wealth of top-end NHL talent including Hart Trophy finalist Anze Kopitar, Norris Trophy-winning defenceman Drew Doughty and high-scoring forward Jeff Carter alongside newcomer Ilya Kovalchuk. But with goalie Jonathan Quick missing all but four games because of injuries, Los Angeles has stumbled through the past 3 1/2 weeks with its top-heavy roster of well-paid veterans, inconsistent depth players and a patchy defence.\n\n\"You look at training camp and you look at the regular season to where we are now, the expectations have not been met,\" Blake said. \"We have really good players. We have players that can make plays. We expect them to make plays, and we expect them to play with that level of compete, and it hasn't been.\"\n\nLongtime assistant coach\n\nStevens took over in 2017 after seven years as an assistant in Los Angeles under Terry Murray and Darryl Sutter. The former Philadelphia Flyers head coach was an assistant on the Kings' Stanley Cup-winning teams in 2012 and 2014.\n\nStevens' promotion was an attempt to create a new mentality for the Kings while maintaining some continuity to Sutter, whose grinding style of hockey won the only two Stanley Cup titles in franchise history. Sutter's coaching and former general manager Dean Lombardi's clever moves won two championships, but also left the Kings with a relatively slow, veteran-laden roster that struggled to compete consistently in the speed-based NHL after 2014.\n\nThe Kings went 45-29-8 in Stevens' debut last season, finishing fourth in the Pacific Division and getting swept by Vegas in the first round of the playoffs. Stevens went 51-39-9 overall in Los Angeles, including four games as the Kings' interim head coach in the 2011-12 season between the tenures of Murray and Sutter.\n\nWe have some real good players. We need them playing at a higher level. \u2014 Kings GM Rob Blake on the firing of head coach John Stevens\n\nEverything went wrong quickly for Stevens, although Blake said he saw concerns from training camp onward. After adding Kovalchuk as a free agent last summer, Los Angeles got off to its awful start this fall while playing largely without Quick and forward Dustin Brown, who were both out with injuries for long stretches.\n\nQuick is currently out for several weeks after undergoing knee surgery, leaving inexperienced Jack Campbell as Los Angeles' top goalie. The Los Angeles farm system's inability to produce above-average players in recent years has dramatically thinned the big-league club's depth and competitiveness, but the Kings' top-end talent isn't producing its share either, according to Blake.\n\nOlympic success\n\n\"We have some real good players,\" Blake said. \"We need them playing at a higher level. It's been an issue this season that we haven't had everyone going the right direction. [That's] partly the reason for this change.\"\n\nBlake said he has no long-standing connections with Desjardins, the Canucks' head coach from 2014-17. After Vancouver missed the playoffs in his final two seasons, Desjardins coached the Canadian men's national team to a bronze medal at the Olympics last February in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nThe Kings clearly also think highly of Sturm, whose 14-year NHL playing career included 17 games with the Kings. He has been the head coach of the German national team since 2015, leading his nation to a silver medal in Pyeongchang.\n\nThe 40-year-old Sturm will spend one more week coaching Germany in the Deutschland Cup before reporting to Los Angeles.

Buckle was president of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary Association at the time.\n\nSean Kelly was convicted of making indecent calls. (CBC)\n\n\"My thought was, 'What police officer would be so idiotic to use a work phone to make harassing phone calls of a sexual nature?'\" Buckle said.\n\nBuckle said he didn't make the call with the intention of affecting any police investigation, and Kelly had already been told by an officer that calls from his phone were under the microscope.\n\n\"While I used the colloquial term 'heads-up,' I did not in any way give him new information or any information he could have used to avoid prosecution.\"\n\nAfter his call to Kelly, Buckle reported the matter to his supervisors.\n\nSays RNC management 'shopping' for different opinion\n\nRecords of the call were released during Kelly's trial in 2015.\n\nNumerous probes into Buckle's call followed. The RNC investigated, and then the province's director of public prosecutions reviewed the RNC's investigation. The Ontario Provincial Police then looked at that review.\n\nThe Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Justice also asked Nova Scotia's Serious Incident Response Team to conduct an investigation.\n\n\"It seems like senior RNC management kept shopping around for an opinion they wanted and weren't getting,\" Buckle said.\n\nHe said the ordeal leaves a particularly bad taste in his mouth after so many years with the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary Association, which aims to improve benefits and working conditions for police officers.\n\nBuckle says he was under investigation for far too long for his call to Kelly. (CBC)\n\nGrounds for charges but not for conviction?\n\nThe latest review of Buckle's behaviour was carried out by former Crown attorney James Maher. In his report, completed in September, he said Buckle didn't act with proper discretion and that there are grounds to charge him with obstruction of justice.\n\nBut he concluded that there is reasonable doubt Buckle intended to interfere with an investigation, making a conviction unlikely.\n\nSt. John's defence lawyer Ellen O'Gorman says it's not uncommon for a case to have grounds for charges but not for conviction.\n\nPolice look for evidence of an offence, but not for proof beyond a reasonable doubt, she said \u2014 and that's what a conviction requires.\n\n\"Before they lay a charge, what they have to be convinced of is that there is a reasonable basis to believe that an offence has been committed,\" she said.\n\nProof beyond reasonable doubt is determined in court, and the bar for that assessment is higher, she said. In Buckle's case, O'Gorman said, Maher found he met the lower bar, but not the higher one.\n\n\"We know there's an allegation, there might be some evidence there, but if that makes it all the way to a judge, is [Buckle] going to be convicted?\" she said.\n\n\"At the end of the report here, Jim Maher says no.\"\n\nWith files from Ted Blades\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "A conservative political advocacy group that was instrumental in taking down the Liberals in Ontario is going national, aiming to do to Justin Trudeau what it did to Kathleen Wynne.\n\nBut the arrival of Ontario Proud on the federal scene renews questions about when political advocacy crosses the line into collusion with a political party, enabling the party to raise and spend more money than legally allowed and, in the process, undoing decades of effort to neutralize the influence of big money on Canadian elections.\n\nOntario Proud was founded by Jeff Ballingall, a digitally savvy former Harper-era Conservative staffer and erstwhile employee of the short-lived Sun News Network.\n\nIt unabashedly promoted Doug Ford's Progressive Conservatives in last spring's Ontario election, using social media to create viral videos and memes that mercilessly mocked Wynne before shifting to attack the NDP once polls showed the premier's party cratering.\n\nIn a \"victory update\" to supporters in June, Ballingall boasted that Ontario Proud's Facebook content was viewed almost 67 million times \u2014 more interactions than the Facebook pages of the three main parties, their leaders, the unions and all other political advocacy groups \"combined!\"\n\nThe group ran \"an aggressive voter contact campaign\" to identify Progressive Conservative supporters and mobilize them to vote, by way of one million-plus text messages and 2.5 million phone calls. It hired \"street teams\" to hand out 15,000 brochures and mailed out 600 \"unplug Wynne\" lawn signs.\n\nIn last spring's Ontario election, Ontario Proud used social media to create viral videos and memes that mercilessly mocked Kathleen Wynne. (CBC)\n\nOntario Proud \"drove the narrative\" of the campaign, Ballingall boasted in the update.\n\n\"We delivered on our goals: a defeat of the Kathleen Wynne-led Liberals and a 'sunlight' campaign that exposed the NDP's extreme candidates and agenda, ultimately helping to deliver a majority government for the Progressive Conservatives.\"\n\nAll as a registered third party \u2014 legal parlance for a political advocacy group \u2014 that bills itself as a non-partisan, not-for-profit, grassroots organization.\n\nOntario Proud says it's building war chest to take down Justin Trudeau\n\nAnd it's now gearing up to the do the same for Andrew Scheer's Conservatives in next fall's federal election.\n\n\"Just like we did with Kathleen Wynne, Ontario Proud is building a war chest to take down Justin Trudeau,\" the group announced in a recent fundraising email.\n\nThe Liberal party is bracing for the onslaught, warning in its own fundraising plea last week that Ontario Proud, \"founded and directed by alumni of Stephen Harper's government,\" will use tactics known for \"lowering the bar for political discourse.\"\n\nBallingall says Ontario Proud's precise plans for the Trudeau takedown will depend on the rules for third parties, which are in flux at the moment.\n\nCurrently under the Canada Elections Act, third parties that spend more than $500 during a federal election must register with Elections Canada. They can spend just over $200,000 on advertising during a campaign but as much as they want before its official start. Whereas political parties are banned from accepting donations from corporations or unions and face a strict $1,575-cap on individual donations, third parties face no restrictions on donors or the size of their contributions.\n\nThe act expressly forbids colluding with political parties to circumvent the spending limits imposed on parties in a bid to level the monetary playing field.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford. Ford's Progressive Conservatives was promoted by Ontario Proud in last spring's Ontario election. (Christopher Katsarov/Canadian Press)\n\nDespite that, in the run-up to the 2015 election, concern mounted that third parties in Canada were morphing into the kind of big-money political action committees that front for political parties in the U.S., rendering spending limits there virtually meaningless.\n\nThe fear was stoked by the emergence of Engage Canada, a group founded by one-time Liberal and NDP strategists who aimed to make Harper's Conservatives \"unelectable.\" In turn, former Conservative advisers created HarperPAC to support the Tories, a short-lived group that shut down after the Conservative campaign team objected.\n\nConcerns were also raised about Canadian environmental advocacy groups using foreign money \u2014 primarily from the U.S. \u2014 to influence the outcome of the election.\n\nIn response, the Trudeau government has taken steps to rein in third parties in Bill C-76, omnibus legislation that the government intends to have in place in time for next fall's election.\n\nIt would increase the spending limits for third parties but broaden the scope of expenses to cover all their political activities, not just advertising, and apply the limits to the months immediately prior to the election call.\n\nIt would also spell out that collusion includes sharing of any information between a third party and a political party.\n\nFew instances in which third parties have been caught colluding\n\nBut there have been few instances in which third parties have been caught colluding in the past and C-76 is unlikely to change that in future.\n\n\"It's very difficult to prove,\" Marc Mayrand, Canada's former chief electoral officer, said in an interview.\n\n\"Mere circumstances or coincidences are not sufficient. You have to establish there was at least a tacit agreement between the two parties to achieve a common goal.\"\n\nIn one of the rare instances where proof was established, Fair Vote Canada, a group that promotes proportional representation, and an NDP campaign manager were found to have colluded in a 2017 byelection in Ottawa-Vanier.\n\nAccording to compliance agreements struck with the commissioner of elections last May, the two admitted to working together to produce a brochure that denounced Trudeau for reneging on his promise of electoral reform and urged electors to vote for either the NDP or Green candidates. The campaign manager also advised Fair Vote Canada on where to distribute the pamphlet for maximum impact.\n\nFor their part, both Ontario Proud and the Conservative party deny they are working in concert.\n\n\"We don't take orders from anyone,\" Ballingall said in an interview.\n\nOntario Proud has sister organizations in B.C. and Alberta\n\nHe insisted Ontario Proud, which has sister organizations in British Columbia and Alberta, is pro-Conservative only to the extent that it is \"the lesser of evils.\"\n\n\"Obviously, we have our own proclivity for smaller government, more responsible government, for stronger national defence,\" he said.\n\n\"So obviously that aligns more with the Conservatives but it's not like we're rah-rah pro-Conservative; we're just mostly (saying), 'We need to stop Justin Trudeau because he's bad for Canada.\"'\n\nAlthough former Conservative MP Maxime Bernier's upstart People's Party of Canada might also be viewed as a natural ally, Ballingall ruled out supporting that option, calling Bernier \"more or less a joke.\"\n\nOntario Proud's street team trying to reach public transit riders in the GTA. (Ontario Proud/Twitter)\n\nConservative party spokesman Cory Hann likewise insisted \"there's no affiliation whatsoever\" with Ontario Proud.\n\nMayrand believes the elections commissioner might be \"much better equipped to detect incidents of collusion\" in future thanks to new powers conferred in C-76 to compel testimony and demand the production of documents.\n\nStill, given the way third parties have been evolving, he thinks limits may eventually have to be imposed on who can donate and how much they can give to third parties \u2014 as is done for political parties.\n\n\"Otherwise,\" Mayrand said, \"it's a run around the Elections Act.\"", "The B.C.

The plan is to take what was once a rather derelict jumble of shops, bars, residences of various sorts, parking lots, and a C-Train track, and turn it into a dense, vibrant, urban neighbourhood.\n\nThat's no easy task.\n\nThe East Village is an urban planner's dream. (Scott Dippel/CBC)\n\nThe East Village is still in the process of becoming whatever it's supposed to become. The sort of place where Calgarians can live walking distance from downtown, work and the riverfront. And where, like all good communities, their daily needs are right on the doorstep: the local coffee shop, watering hole, grocery store, even a dentist.\n\nThat's the plan. Reality is always more complicated.\n\nLike with any big project, there are critics. But a walk around the neighbourhood finds the vibe is mostly positive.\n\nAs resident Beatrice Aucoin puts it, the East Village is a community so tight-knit it feels like a small Cape Breton town, right in the heart of downtown Calgary.\n\nPlanning for the Public\n\nThe East Village was designed by people who plan urban neighbourhoods in metropolises around the world.\n\nFrancisco Alaniz Uribe, an assistant professor of urban design at the University of Calgary, says the community should be the new standard for urban design in this city.\n\nThe key, he says, is the \"high-quality public realm.\"\n\nAs an urban planner, Francisco Alaniz Uribe is watching the East Village project closely. (Francisco Alaniz Uribe)\n\nIt's long been known that human beings react positively to the right kind of public space. Think of the grand squares of Europe \u2014 places you find you just gravitate to. While Calgary may not look like the heart of Prague, we can still design our communities with parks, plazas, streets and sidewalks.\n\nOn a fall day, as Uribe walks around the East Village, he points out the area outside the Simmons building leading to the river. Not a big patch of ground but, he says, the river walk is a prime example of good design.\n\n\"People want to be there,\" he says. \"And they're comfortable, they're safe and they have all the amenities that someone needs to be outside.\"\n\nIt's not just \"oh, yeah, we need some green space here somewhere,\" Uribe says. It's the addition of inviting benches, landscaping and even a public washroom.\n\nThe river walk is often a busy place, full of walkers and cyclists. But step away from the water and deeper into the streets of the East Village, and things are more sporadic.\n\nCelebration Square, or C-Square, is one of the public plazas in Calgary's East Village. It's at 4th Street and 7th Avenue SE, near the C-Train line. (Kathryn Marlow/CBC)\n\nThere are some public spaces ready and waiting \u2014 a community garden, a playground and a dog park. There are also a few plazas. These offer benches and chairs and have the potential to attract people who want to, say, eat their lunch outside, or just sit with a coffee and watch the city go by.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nBut Uribe points out a design flaw. In order to get to the plazas and their welcoming chairs, you need to cross the street. There's no easy path to get there. And things like streets can act as unconscious psychological barriers.\n\nAnd this is something you notice in the East Village \u2014 that while the periphery is built-up and humming, the inner core is still a bit empty. The community is a bit like a doughnut. For the neighbourhood to gain more traction, that will have to change.\n\nUribe says streets and sidewalks will become more active partly based on the kinds of shops and businesses that fill up the main floors of the residential towers.\n\nBut that's not happening as quickly as some would like.\n\nShoppers Wanted\n\nBit by bit, construction continues as the empty areas of the East Village get filled in. But it's uneven.\n\nDouglas Gregory owns the Mari Bakeshop with his fiancee. The bakery and lunch spot is on the ground floor of what was one of the first giant new condo towers to open in the East Village. There are commercial spaces operating near Gregory's shop. But not all the spaces are full.\n\n\"I think the main key is that, at the moment, we are slow in developing businesses here to attract people,\" he says. \"And that's kind of what you need; you need a wide variety of businesses to attract people.\"\n\nThe shop is busy during lunch time, and there are regulars who come frequently enough that Gregory knows them by name. But he says he needs more than just regulars to be a successful business.\n\nThe current population in the East Village sits at about a third of the final number expected. This is difficult for businesses that have moved into the area. They need a high population density, other shops to help create a sense of destination, and the bustle those things create to draw in people from other parts of the city.\n\nGregory says right now, that isn't happening.\n\nThe Simmons building is on the northern edge of East Village. With access from both the street and the river walk, businesses like Aviv Fried's Sidewalk Citizen can draw customers from people walking and cycling along the river. (Rachel Maclean/CBC)\n\nBut not so far away, back at the Simmons building, just off the river walk, Aviv Fried says his business gets customers from outside the neighbourhood. But the owner of Sidewalk Citizen knows this is likely because of the location \u2014 drawing all those people who are walking or cycling along the Bow River.\n\nBut Fried doesn't see much traffic from the street side \u2014 from within the East Village neighbourhood, itself.\n\nHe opened his shop where he did because he wants his business to be in a dense neighbourhood, where it can be a part of a local community. This, Fried says, is something that can be hard to find in Calgary. And so far, he's not seeing the neighbourhood he was expecting in the East Village.\n\n\"I'd like to see people walking down the street. That's, to me, the bigger thing, when you walk down the street. There's walking traffic. And that's still very rare here. A fairly dense neighbourhood should have a lot more walking traffic.\"\n\nThere are several reasons why there may not yet be the foot traffic in and around those east end towers \u2014 after all, the neighbourhood is still being built.\n\nEast Village Junction is one of the hubs where the CMLC and neighbourhood association host events. (Scott Dippel/CBC)\n\nBut Clare LePan says change is coming. She speaks for the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation, which is developing the neighbourhood on behalf of the City of Calgary. LePan says they are getting to critical mass.\n\n\"I think the scales are shifting in East Village,\" she says.\n\n\"We've had a lot of years of heavy construction, with projects like the new central library opening soon, we're starting to sort of see that tipping away from a lot of those construction sites in the community, and really into more of these complete buildings and amenities we've been talking about for the past 10 years.\"\n\nTwo new condo towers opened in October, which will boost the population, and a hotel is expected to open by the end of this year. The library, which is at the opposite end of the neighbourhood from much of the retail, opened Nov. 1.\n\nBut towers, hotels and public architecture do not a community make.\n\nA cozy neighbourhood\n\nWhile more Calgarians are moving into the East Village, those who've already put down roots say it's already undeniably a neighbourhood.\n\nBeatrice Aucoin and Brett Bergie moved into the community in the spring of 2017, with their 9-year-old son Samuel. They moved from Coach Hill, in the Calgary suburbs, to the East Village's N3 tower \u2014 that's the building made famous as the no-car condo.\n\nWith only 620 square feet of living space, they had to downsize \u2014 but say they love it.\n\nBergie says they try to make the neighbourhood an extension of their home. And so they bike along the river, visit the parks in the neighbourhood, and shop at the local businesses.\n\nThat's why Aucoin says it feels more like her hometown of Sydney, N.S., than anywhere she's ever lived.\n\nBrett Bergie and Beatrice Aucoin say the community in East Village is more tight-knit than in any other big city they've experienced. (Kathryn Marlow/CBC)\n\n\"We know quite a few of our neighbours here by name, and they know us by name,\" she says. \"And we know a lot of the owners and the regular employees of the businesses here, and I haven't felt anything like this since I lived in Sydney. East Village really captures some of that small town small urban centre cohesiveness.\"\n\nBut it's not entirely cohesive.\n\nSome seniors, who were living in the East Village long before the new development was even a twinkle in an urban planner's eye, say they feel left out of the new version.\n\nThey say even the shops can be too expensive for the residents of the more established part of the community, some of whom live in low-income housing.\n\nJoan Lapidus has lived in the East Village for 31 years. She says it's starting to feel like she lives \"on the other side of the tracks\" from the new development.\n\n\"We're the poor people on the side, it sounds like, where the people with money, they don't associate. They want to make this into a village where everybody is friends with each other and that, but I don't think that will ever happen. We're different income.\"\n\nBut others say they are glad to have things like coffee shops and hair salons within walking or scooting distance. Many are excited over the arrival of the much-anticipated grocery store, which won't happen for another year.\n\nAll this makes you think about just what a neighbourhood is, and what it needs to help foster a sense of collective identity and community. Thoughtfully designed public squares and fancy coffee shops on every corner only get you so far.\n\nIt also takes energy and interest from the people who live there.\n\nAlain Dupere is President of the East Village Neighbourhood Association. He says he wants everyone who lives in the village, to be part of the neighbourhood. (Kathryn Marlow/CBC)\n\nAlain Dupere is president of the East Village Neighbourhood Association. He's lived there since 2011, and is working hard to make it a community everyone wants to live in. But he knows there is work to be done.\n\n\"There's still a bit of a rift because we have the new community to the north, and the old community to the south,\" says Dupere. \"And in the middle we haven't had the development yet. But it's starting to come.\"\n\nIn a bid to get people to integrate better, Dupere said they recently held a Neighbour Day event.\n\n\"We had about 400 to 500 people that came out, and it was a beautiful mix of old and new, so we're seeing that integration happening ... it is going to be an even better community as we get more people in here, and people get to know their neighbours,\" says Dupere.\n\nThe word the people of the East Village use most frequently is \"potential.\"\n\nA work in progress\n\nThe many residents and business owners who came in during the early phases of the East Village say they know they're trailblazers in a grand urban experiment. They know there will be hiccups. But they seem willing to ride it out.\n\nWhat exactly will they get for their trouble?\n\nFor starters, more neighbours: by the mid-2020s, the population is expected to reach 11,500 people. That's up a huge amount from the current 3,500. Those people will live in the condo and rental towers that are currently under construction \u2014 or are at least planned dots on a map.\n\nResidents are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the grocery store, which is still more than a year away. (Supplied)\n\nThat much-anticipated neighbourhood retail will start to fill out in the next year or two as well. By 2020, the community's shopping centre is supposed to be open: it will contain a grocery store, a drug store, and a liquor store.\n\nAnd to fill out the community \u2014 both physically and socially \u2014 residents are waiting for a community centre. The timelines are still being sorted. The hope is that it will provide meeting spaces, a community kitchen and programming to attract everyone who lives in the East Village, regardless of income level or age.\n\nSo will all that add up to a vibrant, dense, urban village?\n\nWe'll find out in 2028.\n\nMore from the series:", "While the Canadian prohibition on cannabis officially ended on Oct. 17, a B.C.-based author wants people to remember marijuana wasn't the only substance once prohibited by the government.\n\nLiquor prohibition varied from province to province, but in B.C., alcohol was banned from 1917 to 1921. In the United States, alcohol was prohibited from 1920 until 1933.\n\nWhile the U.S. prohibition may have been a hardship for drinkers there, the ban was a big business opportunity for some Canadians, who smuggled spirits along the West Coast in speed boats to the other side of the side of the border.\n\nThe story of these criminal bootleggers turned rich businessmen is catalogued in the new book Tell Nobody Nothin' No How: The Real Story of West Coast Rum Running.\n\n\"If you had anything that floated, that was tied up on the coast here, it was a great opportunity,\" said Rick James, maritime historian and the book's author.\n\nJames said his extensive research into rum running revealed a vast smuggling network centred around Vancouver and Victoria.\n\n\"Since Vancouver and Victoria took the place of material supply ... perhaps a million cases of whiskey have passed from the Vancouver rum fleet to Western American consumers.\" said James, reading from a news article written in the early 20th century.\n\nGovernment-bonded warehouses\n\nThroughout the 12 years that liquor was legal in Canada, but illegal in the United States, James said the booze-running enterprise was a smooth-running, well organized criminal enterprise.\n\nIn many cases, said James, the liquor sold to the U.S. was produced in Canada.\n\n\"The high quality scotches, rums, ryes, brandy ... a lot of the breweries and distilleries here were supplying the fleet.\"\n\nLiquor was stockpiled in government-bonded warehouses at the Ballantyne Pier in Burrard Inlet and Ogden Point in Victoria. Smugglers then had a few options for distributing that supply, said James.\n\nThey could do as Victoria's famous Johnny Schnarr did: paint smuggling boats black and move across the ocean border in the darkness of a moonless night.\n\nOr smugglers could hold clandestine meetings with thirsty American buyers in the hidden coves of the Chatham and Discovery Islands.\n\nOr if they wanted to land a massive score, said James, smugglers could load up large steam ships like the Malahat.\n\nThe Malahat\n\nThe Malahat became infamously known as the Queen of Rum Row and, according to the Vancouver maritime museum, she delivered more contraband liquor than any other ship. These large steam ships would load up in Burrard Inlet before moving their supply out to international waters.\n\nThe ships would transform into \"floating liquor emporiums,\" said James, and would wait near the Farallon Islands off the coast of California for their customers to come to them.\n\n\"There were rare hijackings, and only one incident of major violence,\" added James.\n\nJames will launch his book with a reading on Nov. 1 at the Maritime Museum of British Columbia.\n\nWith files from On the Island", "Adventurer Ross Edgley became the first man to swim around the coast of mainland Britain as he completed a 2,865-kilometre trip to make a triumphant return to dry land in Margate, England, on Sunday.\n\nThe 33-year-old, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, had left the Kent town on June 1, swimming in a clockwise direction.

Of those five, Canada holds the second-largest area of wilderness after Russia.\n\nAccording to the study published in Nature, Australia, the U.S., Brazil, Russia and Canada are the five countries that hold the majority of the world's remaining wilderness.\n\nOscar Venter, an ecosystem science and management associate professor from the University of Northern British Columbia, helped write the study over a three-year period along with researchers from the University of Queensland and the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\n\"Before we undertook this work, there was a general idea that wilderness...these are very large landscapes, far from people and... they're kind of inherently safe, that we don't have to worry too much about them,\" Venter told Daybreak North's Carolina de Ryk.\n\nOn water and land\n\nBut they discovered only about 13 per cent of the world's oceans and only about 23 per cent of land areas can still be considered wilderness, he said.\n\nThe study mapped the globe from 1993 to 2009 and showed that 3.3 million square kilometres of intact wilderness areas on land were encroached upon by industrial-scale human activity.\n\nThat area is about the size of India, Venter said.\n\n\"Once humans move into these landscapes and convert them to things like agriculture or residential areas, there's still a lot of biodiversity there. but you lose a lot of the species that are more sensitive to human activity.\"\n\nSpecies at risk\n\nWhen stacked against other countries, Canada is holding up fairly well with a lot of intact wilderness free from human activity remaining, according to Venter.\n\nAlthough Canada's wilderness is more stable than other places in the world, B.C. is home to more than 1,500 species at risk, according to the B.C.

This week we're highlighting the stories of several children of residential school survivors and the effect intergenerational trauma has had on their lives.\n\nMy name is Sharon Shorty and I am from Whitehorse. I am the child of residential school survivors.\n\nThe impact of residential school is intergenerational, and I am in the first generation to feel the effects of this trauma. My parents, aunts and uncles, and one brother attended residential schools in the Yukon, British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nMy mother Winnie Peterson is a Tlingit woman. She lost access to stories, her language, traditional beliefs and practices like sewing because of residential school.\n\nBlack and white pictures of my mother, late father, and her sisters at Yukon's Baptist Mission School are in a book called Finding Our Faces, which acknowledges the survivors and what they endured: separation from family, bullying from other students, and loss of their culture.\n\nA photo of residential school students on the cover of the book Finding Our Faces. (Submitted by Sharon Shorty)\n\nIn the book, she shares: \"I wasn't quite six years old and, 64 years later, I am finally starting to deal with the issues.\"\n\nI see this as the start of my story.\n\nWhen I was in Grade 4 she left me with her sisters (my aunties) to flee to B.C. from an abusive relationship with my father. It was a traditional practice to leave me with my aunties, and I thank God she did it and for their support.\n\nBefore that, life at home was confusing.\n\nI felt alone and lonesome growing up. I didn't understand where my dad's anger and hurtful words toward me came from.\n\nMy dad, the late Joe Shorty, was angry a lot and it was scary.\n\nMy mom was sad a lot. I felt alone and lonesome growing up. I didn't understand where my dad's anger and hurtful words toward me came from.\n\nI also liked to go to church as a child and my dad would mock me for it. There was very little affection in the home. I did not know that since my parents didn't grow up with their families, they didn't learn parenting skills.\n\nYears later as a new mother, I struggled with being affectionate to my son. I felt that part of the syndrome can be beaten though, and I learned to show my feelings. But it takes a lot of strength.\n\nHealing through humour\n\nAs a storyteller, playwright and comic, I have turned to humour for 20 years.\n\nWinnie Peterson, Sharon Shorty's mother, in residential school. This photo is in the book Finding Our Faces. (Submitted by Sharon Shorty)\n\nDuring the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings, Chief Justice Murray Sinclair asked me and my performing partner to do our comedy act, Gramma Susie and Charlie, at several national events.\n\nHe said survivors would need laughter during the difficult hearings.\n\nIn the routine, we dress as elders and share stories of life. I had discovered that recalling the wisdom and humour of our grandparents and aunties could be a way to reconnect the older and younger generations. It's also a restorative and healing experience.\n\nIt was a privilege to be able to connect with survivors and listen to their stories. I was even more honoured to make people laugh, so they could heal a little more.\n\nIt was challenging to hear about the abuses in public, with so many people listening. I also went into a witnessing room and recounted my experiences as a young child, growing up among people who attended residential school.\n\nIt was a privilege to be able to connect with survivors and listen to their stories.\n\nI witnessed the trauma of the generation before me.\n\nDuring the events, there was a birthday party for survivors to acknowledge that their birthdays had never been recognized in residential school.\n\nIt was wonderful to see them childlike, enjoying the balloons, birthday cards and cupcakes. I took a cupcake for my late father.\n\nIt made me realize why we didn't have many birthday parties as kids, and why it was so important for me to have parties for my son.\n\n'Reconciliation is a journey'\n\nSharon Shorty and Duane Aucoin in costume during a Gramma Susie and Charlie performance at the Dawson City Music Festival. (Submitted by Sharon Shorty)\n\nWhen something new comes up in my life, I realize the impact intergenerational trauma has on me \u2014 my initial reaction is always fear and anxiety.\n\nFor example, I recently had to get a CPAP machine to treat sleep apnea. Dealing with the specialist, who is an authority figure, adds to my stress.\n\nWhen I feel sad in the fall \u2014 back-to-school time \u2014 it's not just coming from me and my family but from the past seven generations and what they have gone through.\n\nIt has been proven that these memories get passed through our DNA and I totally believe that it can.\n\nSometimes life can become too much to handle, it overwhelms me a great deal and I feel lost. The reconciliation that I need to do is with the survivors in my life and my son. This is an ongoing process through private talks, sharing my story, and prayer.\n\nWhen I was dating my husband, he invited me to church. It took me a long time to attend. It helped that it was the United Church and knowing it was one of the first churches to apologize to residential school survivors in 1986 \u2014 an act of reconciliation helped make me feel safe to go.\n\nWhen I was at TRC events over the years, I noticed there were more intergenerational survivors than residential school survivors.\n\nI would like to see more opportunities for us. I hope there are conferences, gatherings, and healing events for us to share and understand the impact it has had on the children.\n\nPhotos of Sharon Shorty's relatives are in this book, Finding Our Faces, which acknowledges former students of Yukon\u2019s Indian Mission School. (Submitted by Sharon Shorty)\n\nI also hope other Canadians realize that reconciliation is for everyone, and that reconciliation is a journey.\n\nWhen I say I get overwhelmed, it is because I often wonder if I'll ever be healed from the intergenerational trauma of Indian residential school syndrome.\n\nFor my son, I hope it will be easier than what I've gone through.\n\nHe needs the second generation to be there to support and encourage him, and to stop the cycle of trauma, so healing can gradually grow over the generations.\n\nTo the survivors before me who have had the courage to share what they went through at residential school \u2014 I am really happy for that.\n\nI've seen it make a difference in my life, that in their truth I can find my own ways to heal and to search for my own truth.\n\nCBC North is hosting a panel discussion on this topic on Nov. 8 in Whitehorse at the Kwanlin Dun Cultural Centre at 7 p.m. It is open to the public.\n\nIf you need support, call the Yukon Distress and Support Line at 1-844-533-3030 or the Inuit and First Nations Hope and Wellness Helpline at 1-855-242-3310.", "The City of Ottawa has received a third proposal for a highrise tower on Scott Street near the Westboro transit station \u2014 an area which typically prohibits buildings higher than six storeys.\n\nThe other two projects have already been approved, with construction already underway on the site that used to house a Trailhead outdoors store.\n\nNow, a proposal has been submitted by EBC Inc., a Montreal-based builder that was part of the consortium that built the new Ottawa Art Gallery downtown.\n\nEBC hopes to build a 20-storey tower with 140 residential units on the site next door to the former Trailhead location.

It's a hat she wears often, hair loss or no hair loss.\n\n\"Trish's [hats] are so unique and so special,\" Sullivan said. \"The fact that she made me some more to wear is such a thoughtful thing.

She hopes the hats will be lighter and more comfortable for people going through chemotherapy and have sensitive skin, or for those who've lost their hair for other reasons.\n\nHirschkorn said the idea came from a request made by Janice Stephenson, a Halifax woman with alopecia, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss. She wanted something more comfortable to wear in the summer.\n\n\"I thought, 'Well, now why don't I just make them thinner, like really thin?'\" Hirschkorn told Shift New Brunswick. \"I normally felt like I don't want thin spots. To me, that's a bit of a failure \u2026 but then I thought, 'Well, why don't I try to achieve failure and put these thin spots throughout?'\"\n\nHair loss can be difficult for anyone. For many, beauty is tied to hair, its thickness and style. Fredericton hat maker Trish Hirschkorn hopes a new line of hats can help. 6:39\n\nSo instead of putting the wool on one side and then the silk on the other, she decided to sandwich a swatch of thin wool between silk, so the pattern of the silk will be on the outside, and the soft silk will lay against the wearer's skin.\n\n\"I love it,\" Stephenson said of the hat she inspired. \"It was never an option for me to have a wig, ever \u2026 I just really didn't like the concept of wearing something that was representing something that wasn't really me.\"\n\nThe thinner hats work better for Sullivan as well. When she's hiking in chilly weather the hat is cool enough to minimize sweating, and when she's in treatment, the reminder of her friend will be comforting.\n\n\"I had ovarian cancer so the chemotherapy was pushing me into menopause and I'd have these hot flashes and so I could never tolerate wearing a wig,\" Sullivan said. \"My head was cold and I don't always want to be seen with no hair and now having these new hats is going to be a new option because they're so nice and stylish.\"\n\nOne of the hats made by Fredericton-based hat maker Trish Hirschkorn.

These guys are producing super \u2026 trees.\n\nEver since Barry Linehan, who manages the provincial government's Centre for Agriculture and Forestry Development in Wooddale, was in school, he dreamed of growing a bigger, better version of the trees made by Mother Nature. These days, his dream is coming true.\n\nLinehan checks out a recently planted super seedling. (Leigh Anne Power)\n\n\"So, we started in the early '80s, going out and covering the entire province looking for these super trees,\" he said.\n\n\"Technical staff combed thousands and thousands of stands looking for these fast-growing trees, large diameter, small branches, which would mean better quality lumber. Trees that had no sign of disease and straight.\"\n\n\"Almost a thousand different trees were identified as being these super trees. We call them 'plus trees.'\"\n\nFinding super trees in the wild was just the first step. Linehan and his colleagues then had to figure out how to duplicate them in great numbers.\n\n\"First, they were cloned by grafting and brought to the nursery here. Then they were bred and then planted out in tests,\" he explained. \"So, any improvement program \u2026 if you're working with racehorses, you're looking to breed the two thoroughbreds, then test the offspring, then select the offspring. It's the same with trees.\"\n\nOne of dozens of greenhouses at Wooddale, filled with super tree seedlings. (Leigh Anne Power)\n\nOnce they successfully cloned the best trees, the scientists started cross-breeding them.\n\n\"The female part of the tree on a conifer is a cone. So we pull this bag over the tree. It's got a window in it so you can peek in and see how she's doing,\" he said.\n\n\"So if the cone is receptive, she lets you know. Then we collect pollen off another tree that we want to cross it with.\"\n\n\"And we put that in a little perfume bottle, make a slit in the bag, puff this pollen in and seal it. Then we know that every seed that's in this bag is of this known pedigree.\"\n\nPart of Dean Taylor's job is the actual breeding of the super trees. He's the guy who uses that perfume bottle to spray pollen into the cone bags. His colleagues jokingly call him the Sperminator.\n\nTaylor shows off a cooler filled with millions of tree seeds. (Leigh Anne Power)\n\nAfter the cones produce thoroughbred seeds, he has to get them out of there.\n\nThe cones have to be dried, and the seeds shaken out. Then they have to be separated from all the debris that's shaken out with them. They're filtered through the several levels of a separator and in the end, millions of super seeds are bagged and stored in the cooler at minus ten degrees until planting time.\n\nAlso in the cooler are huge containers of wild seed, ready in case of a major fire or outbreak of disease that would require replanting a lot of trees quickly.\n\nYear-round operation\n\nTaylor says when breeding season is over, it doesn't mean the work stops. The greenhouses need to be tended and records kept up to date so he knows exactly which trees carry what genes.\n\n\"Never a dull moment here,\" he said. \"You could be at anything on moment and the next be at something else. There's that much stuff going on here. Especially in the tree world, you could have insects, disease, parasites. Anything could happen in one day. You're going around looking at something and things change overnight.\"\n\nLinehan checks out a sack of super tree cones. (Leigh Anne Power)\n\nThe vast tree orchards at Wooddale have been decades in the making. Now, though, Linehan and his team are starting to see real results.\n\n\"Our first generation is nearing completion. We're getting about 15 per cent genetic gains in our white spruce. And in a couple of years we'll have 20 per cent genetic gain,\" he said.\n\n\"By genetic gain, I mean more wood volume per hectacre. Twenty per cent, 15 per cent more wood volume today than there was originally, compared to wild tree stands.\"\n\nProgram already showing success\n\nThe goal is to produce 40 per cent more wood. That would mean 40 per cent more viable timber for building, less land use and easier access for harvesters.\n\nAnd super trees grow faster than those in the wild, so there's less time to wait before cutting them.\n\nTrees are both male and female, with the female cones on the upper branches. (Leigh Anne Power)\n\nBarry Linehan says every year when he sees the data that proves his program is working, it's like Christmas.\n\nHe'll probably have retired from his dream job by the time it reaches its peak.

Imposing foreign, misspelled, or translated names on to Indigenous people was a not merely for administrative convenience, it was a deliberate aspect of a systematic attempt to erase our cultures and identities. Names helped impose European traditions on Indigenous populations. Many families were named after the priest, the Indian agent, or given the names of Christian saints.\n\nNaming practices driven underground\n\nIn this way, families became regulated under patriarchal colonial norms even when they came from matrilineal and matriarchal cultures such as the Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka (Mohawk). For example, assigning of patrilineal surnames helped regulate division of property among heirs in a way that conformed with European, not Indigenous, property laws.\n\nThis does not mean that our naming practices were wiped out, but they were driven underground. Jokes by non-Indigenous people about getting your \"Indian name\" \u2014 which are almost invariably insulting or racist monikers invented on the spot \u2014 mock real ceremonies that still continue in our communities. Receiving a traditional name is not something done lightly, nor is it something every Indigenous person has a chance to experience.\n\nTo add insult to injury, these names were ineligible for official registration for generations. Unfortunately, this sometimes means that my ancestors' true names have been lost, as they were never recorded.\n\nWhat really got me thinking about names was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 17th Call to Action. The Commission asks all provinces and territories to waive administration fees for five years so residential school survivors and their families can reclaim traditional names that were stripped from them. This includes allowing single names, rather than requiring a surname, and would also necessarily mean allowing symbols outside of the roman alphabet.\n\nThis wasn't something that just came out of the blue; throughout the public and private testimonies of survivors of residential schools, the issue of names and identity came up again and again.\n\nChelsea Vowel gave her two youngest children Cree names. She says teaching people about their names can be a starting place for education about Indigenous Peoples. (Submitted by Chelsea Vowel)\n\nWhen I remarried, and we decided to have more children, I knew immediately that I wanted their names to be in Cree, and my partner supported that. I did ceremony for both names, fasted and asked for guidance from language speakers.\n\nSpelling their names correctly, in standardized Cree, was very important to me because I want our descendants to be sure of what their names mean.\n\nGetting the spelling right\n\ns\u00e2kow\u00eaw means s/he makes a joyful sound, or war whoops \u2014 it depends on the context. s\u00e2k\u00eaw\u00eaw, on the other hand, means s/he comes into view! Now you tell me, even two generations from now, if anyone could be sure which meaning the spelling Sakiwayo intended to evoke?\n\nOur second daughter is named w\u00e2panac\u00e2hkos, which means dawn star, or Venus. Both names contain circumflexes over certain vowels. My toddler was born in Quebec and the baby was born in Alberta; both jurisdictions allow these accents.\n\nHowever, neither province allows characters from non-English alphabets, which mean that some Indigenous parents cannot give their child a name in their language. This can affect the meaning of the name itself! For example, imagine if circumflexes were not allowed and a parent wanted to name their child n\u00eepiy, which is Cree for a leaf. Without the accent, it looks (and sounds) like nipiy, which means water!\n\nIn both provinces, they are required to have a surname. I have had people suggest that allowing people to have single names would be too confusing, until I remind them that there are millions of John Smiths out in the world. Traditionally, we also had ways of making sure names remained unique in their generation, and if traditional names are reclaimed en masse it could be we reinstate these protocols as well.\n\nA starting place for education\n\nMaybe I was too chicken to insist on that extra step of giving them only one name, but I couldn't dismiss my fear of the bureaucratic hassle that would result. We'd be fighting over this every single time we had to do any administrative task involving the girls, and we didn't want the headache. As it is, they're going to have to spell their names out constantly.\n\nFor the most part when people ask my children's names, there is an inevitable slow blink and confusion. I am asked to say them again, after which the person repeats their names, perfectly each time. When making an effort to say it right, they do. There is always a conversation about what their names mean, and where they come from.\n\nI am reminded that taking time to learn the proper pronunciation of a person's name is simply a matter of respect. More than this is the fact that our names can be a starting place for education; on more than one occasion, I have met people who had no idea that Cree and M\u00e9\u200btis people exist, much less that they are on our territory.\n\nGiving my children these names is a powerful act of reclamation. These lands formed n\u00eahiyaw\u00eawin (Cree), and when we speak our language, even if it's just our names, the land hears us. The political doesn't get much more personal than speaking the names of my children every day.\n\nOver the years, I have had non-Indigenous people ask me about Cree names in their search for baby names. I want to stress that these names are not merely pretty sounding, or up for grabs.\n\nReclaiming our right to name our children in our way, and have those names recognized and respected, is a powerful act. It is one of the many ways in which we are reclaiming and asserting our identities against the backdrop of a history of dispossession and erasure.\n\nIt is my hope that the rest of Canada will enable legislative changes to answer the TRC's Call to Action on traditional names. More than this, I am looking forward to learning the traditional names of Indigenous Peoples all across Canada.", "The Royal Canadian Legion is embracing the digital age with a new virtual version of the symbolic poppy.\n\n\"We really need to go with the times, and we're trying to reach a younger audience,\" Pamela Sweeny, the Ontario Legion's provincial executive director, told CBC's London Morning Thursday.\n\nSweeny noted that fewer people are carrying around cash and change these days, opting to exclusively use cards or cellphones instead.

I'm terrified because my country's government is proposing to erase my existence.\n\nWe recently learned of the Trump administration's proposed definition of gender \u2014 a proposal that would exclude trans people from federal recognition, and potentially many civil rights protections.\n\nThis definition could have severe consequences. Under this definition, I could be denied access to the medication I need. I could be denied housing and work, and discriminated against legally based on the fact that my gender does not match the \"F\" on my passport.\n\nThe current U.S. government might try to erase trans people, but I still believe in the arc of the moral universe bending toward justice.\n\nIt is hard not to feel like my country is trying to betray me.\n\nBecause hate crimes are on the rise on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border, it's hard to feel safe anywhere.\n\nThe signal that the Trump administration is sending in a country that supposedly stands for \"liberty and justice for all,\" is that a large group of American citizens \u2014 and a community of people all over the world \u2014 deserve neither liberty nor justice.\n\nAnd while it's true that this is happening south of the Canadian border, it's all too likely that the Trump administration's actions will be another incitement to bullies everywhere.\n\nFinding light in the darkness\n\nBut in this situation, I find myself searching for \u2014 and finding \u2014 some measure of light in this darkness.\n\nWhen I moved to St. John's three years ago, I was struck by how welcoming and inclusive this town was \u2014 especially in comparison to the U.S. \u2014 and the fact that my trans identity just didn't matter.\n\nPeople were more interested in what I had to offer as a member of this community than in how I presented my gender. Here was a safe spot for a young trans person to go to school, put down roots, and be able to focus on the parts of identity that don't centre around gender.\n\nAnd while there has been a rise of visible transphobia at Memorial University, in the form of stickers that have appeared in elevators and bathrooms, the community has pushed back, hard.\n\nA dedicated team of allies has rallied around us, and around the cause of human rights.\n\nSome students at Memorial University tore down transphobic stickers and replaced them with their own messages.

AMC's zombie drama, once a juggernaut with 18 million viewers per episode, has been steadily losing its audience over the last two years. It started this season with ratings down by more than 50 per cent from their peak. Can the show hobble on without its lead?\n\nRick Porter, staff writer for The Hollywood Reporter, says losing Grimes poses an \"inherent risk.\"\n\n\"He's so identified with the show and has been from the beginning, from being central to the story lines to being the guy on all the posters, it runs the risk of people wondering if they still want to watch if he's not there anymore.\"\n\nThe stakes for AMC\n\nBy all accounts, AMC did not choose to dispatch with Sheriff Grimes of its own volition. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly radio, Andrew Lincoln said he wanted to spend more time with his children in England after nine years toiling away on the show's set in Georgia.\n\nFrom Lincoln's penultimate episode, it seems pretty clear that his character will, in fact, die. Episode four saw him speared through the abdomen, bleeding profusely, and surrounded by \"walkers\" (zombies in the vernacular of The Walking Dead). And given his leadership role and family ties to other key characters \u2014\u200b partner of Michonne, father to Judith \u2014 \u200bthe likelihood of him just going away to some other community seems slim.\n\nSince fans knew of Lincoln's departure for a while, AMC made an unusual decision to heavily promote the episodes as the last time for viewers to see Rick Grimes. It may seem like a cynical strategy, but Rick Porter says it just might work \u2014 in the short run at least.\n\n\"I think probably, that episode, more people will tune in,\" says Porter. \"And then after that, it's going to be really interesting to see what happens.\"\n\nWhat happens after may well depend on how Rick Grimes' death is handled.\n\nDeaths done badly\n\nOne of the reasons it's so crucial for The Walking Dead to handle Grimes' death properly is that at least a part of the show's audience attrition has to do with previous character deaths that fans felt were manipulative or done purely for shock value.\n\nIt began with fan favourite Glenn Rhee (played by Steven Yeun), who appeared to be killed in season six only to be revealed as alive many episodes later. Then he was brutally killed by villain Negan at the beginning of season seven (but not before making the audience wait the whole summer to find out who was on the receiving end of Negan's barbed bat).\n\nThen, last season, came the zombie-bite death of Carl Grimes, Rick's teenaged son, who had literally grown in front of the audience's eyes.\n\nActor Chandler Riggs played Rick Grimes' son, Carl, for eight years on The Walking Dead. (Gene Page/AMC)\n\nThat death came as a shock to many, as Carl remains alive and well in the ongoing comic book version of The Walking Dead. In fact, he has replaced his aging father as the leader of a new civilization. Critics once again agreed that the death seemed unnecessary \u2014 included only for shock value \u2014 and many fans took to social media to express their outrage.\n\nI\u2019m getting really heated about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TWD?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TWD</a> because I\u2019m a huge fan of the comics and it\u2019s been one of my favourite shows since it started.

Many attribute this shift to the new show runner, Angela Kang.\n\nAngela Kang, new showrunner and executive producer of Season 9 of The Walking Dead, has been credited by many critics for improving the show's quality. (Willy Sanjuan/AP)\n\nThe show's ratings may be bad compared to its peak seasons, but they're the envy of other programs.\n\n\"Unless literally everybody stops watching after Andrew Lincoln leaves, I'm still fairly certain it would be renewed,\" says Porter. \"It's still, despite all of its losses, easily the biggest show on AMC and other than Game of Thrones, the biggest scripted series on cable.\"\n\nAt one point, the idea that a show about a zombie drama \u2014\u200b a niche subject if there ever was one \u2014\u200bcould be one of the top-rated shows on television, seemed impossible. Maybe The Walking Dead is about to pull out another ace from its tattered, zombie-bitten sleeve.", "An internal Transport Canada investigation into a fatal crash in 2001 concluded that coach buses without seatbelts may put passengers at \"unnecessary risk\" of injuries, yet the document was kept hidden for years until The Fifth Estate recently uncovered it using the Access to Information Act.\n\nInstead, the federal regulatory department continued to insist publicly that seatbelts were not necessary in coach buses.\n\nThe 61-page report outlines how four children were killed in a coach bus rollover in Sussex, N.B., while en route to a music festival in Halifax from Boston in April 2001. It says that if the children had been wearing seatbelts, \"they would not have been ejected\" from the vehicle.\n\nElaine Alpert, whose son Stephen died in that crash, said she is disturbed to learn that Transport Canada did not immediately make seatbelts mandatory in 2001 after the federal regulatory department reached their conclusions.\n\n\"I didn't know this existed,\" Alpert said when contacted by The Fifth Estate and provided a copy of the internal document. \"Why didn't they act on it?\"\n\nElaine Alpert, whose son Steve Glidden was killed in a coach bus crash in 2001, examines the report of an investigation conducted by Transport Canada into the crash.

(Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)\n\nLast month, The Fifth Estate revealed another internal Transport Canada study from 2010 that was also not publicly released. It concluded that school buses \"failed\" safety tests and did not do enough to prevent \"serious injuries.\"\n\nDuring the last two decades, there have been thousands of injuries and dozens of deaths on both coach buses and school buses in Canada.\n\nIn 2014, after several passengers were seriously injured in a bus crash on the Coquihalla Highway in British Columbia, an industry executive warned federal Transport Minister Lisa Raitt that \"it is only a matter of time before there is another fatal incident.\"\n\nIn a letter obtained by The Fifth Estate, Doug Switzer, president of Motor Coach Canada, raised concerns that Transport Canada had still not made seatbelts mandatory despite his efforts personally lobbying for them since 2008.\n\nDoug Switzer, president of Motor Coach Canada, says the thinking around seatbelts on coach buses needs to change. (Kimberly Ivany/CBC)\n\nIn his letter dated Aug. 29, 2014, Switzer wrote that he hoped the government would \"finally move forward\" on this \"extremely important safety issue.\"\n\nRaitt, now the Conservative deputy leader, told The Fifth Estate that after receiving that letter, she took it up with officials at Transport Canada. She said they advised her that it \"takes a long time to get regulations going.\"\n\n\"Departments have to be encouraged to do things quicker.\"\n\nRaitt said she sympathizes with Alpert's argument that if the regulatory department had mandated seatbelts 20 years ago, and if bus passengers were required to wear them, numerous injuries and deaths in Canada would have been prevented.\n\n\"I can't disagree with that at all,\" she told The Fifth Estate's Bob McKeown.\n\nWaiting for the U.S.\n\nSwitzer said that for years the Canadian government had been waiting for the United States to establish a law around seatbelts on coach buses. The idea was to ensure that coach buses traveling across the border would adhere to the same equipment standards.\n\nSwitzer said he was told that Transport Canada would \"pretty much just copy\" the American rules once they were implemented.\n\nThat process, however, dragged on for years, and Canadian bus passengers continued to ride on coach buses without a federal seatbelt requirement. During that period from 2008 to 2014, Transport Canada figures show there were at least 550 injuries in coach bus collisions across the country.\n\nToday, Raitt said the federal government's policy of waiting for the U.S. to act first was \"inappropriate.\"\n\nLisa Raitt, a former federal transport minister, says the federal government\u2019s policy of waiting for the U.S. to act first on the issue of seatbelts in coach buses was 'inappropriate.' (John Badcock/CBC)\n\nSwitzer said he was even more surprised that the new Liberal government didn't act sooner \u2014 even after the U.S. passed its regulations in 2016.\n\n\"If the policy all along was to cut, copy and paste ... from the U.S. regulation, I'm not sure why we were still studying theirs,\" Switzer said. \"Up until the Humboldt accident, that was still the answer.\"\n\nIn th aftermath of the Humboldt tragedy, federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau said he would make seatbelts a requirement on new coach buses by September 2020.\n\n\"We've all heard the message to buckle up over the years, and I think it's time we brought this approach to highway buses, too,\" Garneau said in a media release at the time. \"By having seatbelts on highway buses, we can help reduce injuries in severe collisions, such as rollovers, and improve safety for everyone.\"\n\nWhy not do it now?\n\nFor families of the Humboldt Broncos, that admission by the federal government \u2014 that seatbelts save lives in severe collisions \u2014 comes far too late for those who died in the bus crash.

(Chris Wattie/Reuters)\n\nIn Canada, the federal government mandates safety equipment in buses. The provinces are responsible for enforcing its use.\n\nThe provinces and the federal government were still studying those proposals at the time of the Humboldt Broncos bus crash.\n\nYet that government study from 2001 shows the federal transportation regulatory department will have waited nearly two decades before acting on what it already knew would protect passengers from injuries and fatalities.\n\nBus window came loose\n\nThat Transport Canada report, obtained by The Fifth Estate, details exactly what happened that day in 2001 when four middle school children on the trip from Boston to Halifax were killed after their coach bus rolled over while taking a sharp turn off the highway.\n\nThe report concluded that coach buses without seatbelts \"may be placing occupants at an unnecessary risk of injury during a collision.\"\n\nAll four children were ejected from the bus after a window came loose.\n\nWatch a reconstruction animation of students ejected from a bus.\n\nIn this reconstruction animation, RCMP show how students on a coach bus were ejected after the bus rolled on its side near Sussex, N.B. in 2001. 0:24\n\n\"The failure of a large tour bus window can result in a significant risk of ejection for unbelted occupants, particularly during rollover events,\" the report said. \"None of the seating positions, from which the fatally injured occupants were ejected, were equipped with seatbelts.\"\n\nFamilies of those killed and injured in the Humboldt Broncos crash say enforcing use of seatbelts is as important as requiring them. The charter bus company involved in the crash had already installed seatbelts without a federal rule, but none of the players were wearing one.\n\n\"You might get a little pushback but I think eventually like helmets on bicycles, like anything, people would start to accept it as the norm,\" said Chris Joseph.\n\nSteve Glidden was 12 years old when he died in a coach bus crash in Sussex, N.B., in 2001.

It has a darker, more mellow tone to it, but it feels about the same to play.\"\n\nBrown said they worked with engineers in the 3D-printing process to get the sound of the instrument exactly right.

That goal seems to be well within the Democrats' range, according to the way the polls are shaping up.\n\nThe electoral map for the House is tough for the Democrats. This is in part due to demographic \"sorting\" \u2014 Democrats concentrating in cities, Republicans in rural and suburban areas \u2014 but also due to gerrymandering. In many U.S. states, the parties that control state legislatures get to draw the new electoral boundaries after each census of the population.\n\nThe last redistricting took place following the U.S. census in 2010 \u2014 which turned out to be a very good election year for Republicans. The result was a map stacked against the Democrats. Without a lead of at least five points in the national popular vote, the Democrats are unlikely to win enough seats to give them control of the House.\n\nBut polls suggest that the Democrats hold a lead of about seven to eight percentage points nationwide over the Republicans. Even the most pessimistic surveys give the Democrats an edge of at least five points, indicating that even in the worst-case scenario, the party might still be able to squeak by.\n\nA poll analysis from FiveThirtyEight as of Nov. 2 forecasts how things could shake out in this week's U.S. midterm elections. (CBC)\n\nFundamentals hurt Republicans\n\nBut if you don't trust the polls (and after Trump's upset victory in 2016, a lot of Americans don't), you can turn to a number of other indicators that lean heavily in favour of the Democrats.\n\nThe party has made significant gains in a series of special elections held since the presidential vote two years ago, most notably winning a Senate race in Alabama last year. And while that race featured unusual circumstances \u2014 the Republican, Roy Moore, faced multiple accusations of sexual misconduct \u2014 the Democrats repeated those gains in less controversial races.\n\nOn average, the margin has swung by 18 points toward Democratic candidates in special House elections over the last two years. A swing of even half that size on Tuesday would easily award the party control of the chamber.\n\nThe party also is outpacing the Republicans by a margin of two-to-one in fundraising, a discrepancy that has not been seen in recent history.\n\nAt 42 per cent, Trump's approval rating is worse than former president Barack Obama's was when his party suffered significant losses in the 2010 midterms.\n\nAnd the historical precedent looks bad for the Republicans. Since 1946, the party that controls the White House has lost an average of 25 seats in midterm elections.\n\nSenate an uphill climb for Democrats\n\nBut while the signs look good for the Democrats in the House, the Senate is another story.\n\nEvery seat is up for grabs in the House, but only a third of those in the Senate are being contested for six-year terms. The Democrats need to make a net gain of two seats in order to take control of the Senate, but the field isn't very wide for them; they're already the incumbents in three-quarters of the seats at stake.\n\nTheir two best shots of flipping Republican seats are in Arizona \u2014 where Kyrsten Sinema is narrowly ahead of Republican Martha McSally \u2014 and Nevada, where Jacky Rosen is neck-and-neck in the polls with Republican incumbent Dean Heller.\n\nOther seats they could win are harder to find. The party trails by at least four points in every other Republican seat, with those in Tennessee and Texas \u2014 where fundraising star Beto O'Rourke is up against Ted Cruz \u2014 offering the Democrats' best hopes for an upset.\n\nFormer U.S. president Barack Obama at a campaign rally with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, left, and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, in Miami, Fla. (Lynne Sladky/Associated Press)\n\nLooking only at Republican seats, the odds don't look so bad for the Democrats. But that assumes that the party can hold the seats it already has. That appears unlikely.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp trails Kevin Cramer, her Republican challenger, by about nine points in North Dakota. The party is also in tight races in Missouri and Indiana, states which Trump won by a margin of 19 points over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Florida is a toss-up.\n\nSo a lot needs to go right for the Democrats if they're to take control of the Senate. They have to hold all of their Trump-state Senate seats and win two (or three, if Heitkamp is defeated) from the Republicans. They might not be able to pull that off.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the results in the Senate won't be worth watching.\n\nA poll analysis from FiveThirtyEight as of Nov. 2 forecasts how things could shake out in this week's U.S. midterm elections. (CBC)\n\nSenate results important for 2020 vote\n\nBecause only one-third of the Senate is contested every two years, the results of one election can have a significant impact on future votes. If the Democrats can't win control of the Senate this year, they might be able to manage it in 2020.\n\nBut that still would require the Democrats to perform reasonably well on Tuesday. If the 51-49 Republican edge in the Senate holds, the Democrats would still have a path to a majority with victories in Colorado and North Carolina in 2020.\n\nIf the party can't repeat its 2017 upset in Alabama in 2020, it could instead defeat unpopular Republican senators in Kansas or Kentucky, reverse a close 2014 Republican victory in Alaska or flip traditionally-blue Maine. The Democrats, in other words, will have more options in two years than they do now.\n\nIn fact, if the Democrats can make a net gain of just one seat in this cycle, a majority in 2020 becomes all the easier. If they suffer a net loss of one seat, however, taking the Senate in 2020 could be just as tough for the Democrats as it looks to be this year. That would force them to wait until 2022, when the map will be much more favourable \u2014 but the political environment could be more unpredictable.\n\nAnd 'unpredictable' is a pretty good word to describe the last few years in U.S. politics. The country could still be in store for another surprise on Tuesday. The Republicans might beat their polls again, or the Democrats \u2014 surging on a wave of enthusiasm hinted at in fundraising and special elections \u2014 could win an even bigger victory than the polls suggest.\n\nThat would put control of both houses of Congress into Democratic hands \u2014 and the fate of Donald Trump's presidency as well.\n\nHow to watch CBC's midterm coverage on Tuesday:", "The Calgary Stampeders have cemented their spot atop the CFL's West Division, but the club's head coach feels like his squad doesn't have what it takes to win heading into the playoffs.\n\n\"We need to be a better team.

Donovan shared some of his thoughts with The Homestretch ahead of the event.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length. You can listen to the complete interview here.\n\nRonan Donovan is photographer with National Geographic. (Submitted by Ronan Donovan)\n\nQ: What kind of images are you sharing?\n\nA: I am going to share a mix of social mammals, ranging from chimpanzees in Uganda, mountain gorillas in Rwanda and some wolves in Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic.\n\nQ: You lived in Yellowstone National Park for a year documenting the lives of wolves. What was that like?\n\nA: That was an incredible experience, my first assignment with National Geographic.\n\nIt was a long time to be in the field which allows you to have an access and intimacy with subjects that you can't get on shorter assignments.\n\nIt's a place that's very hard to get images of wolves, because they are so shy to humans. It was a challenging assignment.\n\nQ: Was it like that in Ellesmere Island?\n\nA: No, it was the complete opposite.\n\nEllesmere has wolves that have basically neutral interactions with humans, so not negative. They are curious about us. They approach and allow you this proximity.\n\nYou can follow them all day, 24 hours a day, because the sun never goes down in the summer.\n\nThey would steal stuff of mine, pull up tent stakes, they would try and steal a camera and now and then. It was a very different interaction.\n\nQ: What did you observe in their social behaviour?\n\nA: Anybody who has a dog is aware of how sweet, kind, generous and intelligent dogs and canines are. Wolves are the same.\n\nEverything is about the family, the pups and teaching them life lessons. They hunt everything from mice to small rabbits all the way up to bison. They have to learn that so it's all about family teaching and close interactions.\n\nIt's amazing to hear all the vocalization that goes on, the high-pitched whining, the excited squeals.\n\nTo see them in the wild is something totally special for me.\n\nQ: Did you see any similarities to humans?\n\nA: Absolutely. There are nuclear families, mom, dad and multi-generational offspring. Elderly humans and elderly wolves are the most respected. They carry the knowledge reservoir for that society.\n\nThere are also cultural differences, the way they hunt and interact, how they play, all those things are standards of all social mammals. The play is one of the things that we can relate to the most as humans, because of how much fun it is to watch but we also know how much fun it is to play.\n\nIt feels good to play.\n\nQ: You also studied bears in Yellowstone, what stood out to you about their behaviour?\n\nA: They are social for part of their lives. When they are with their mom, they are social for a couple of years. They go in the den together. You can imagine the giant bear pile for four or five months in the den.\n\nAs adults, they are kind of on their own. They communicate by scent. I documented this behaviour at a place called the 'bear bathtub,' is what we named it. Bears would come, sometimes four or five a day, have a drink and soak in the pool, but also leaving their scent for the other bears.\n\nSocializing, but not in person.\n\nQ: You have studied chimpanzees in Uganda, how do they compare?\n\nA: Chimps are just pure emotion and reaction.\n\nWhen they see something they get excited, they don't think about it. They just full on do things.\n\nIt's aggression, it's play, all the things that humans do.\n\nQ: What can we learn from these animals?\n\nA: Connectedness is so important.\n\nThe idea of family and friendly ties are required to make it through life. Humans are the same. We can't get by on our own.\n\nIt reminds us the importance of working together, teamwork, bonding, socializing and play.\n\nAll of those things that some people forget about or take for granted but those social aspects are so important.\n\nQ: What goes into capturing that one special image?\n\nA: People think I am patient but I am actually just super driven and stubborn.\n\nMost of the time when I am in a waiting situation, it's not like a zen, relaxed moment. It's more like an internal spaz out, anxiety-ridden time, trying to figure out if I made the right decision being here as opposed to being over there?\n\nIs it ever going to come? Is this project a total failure? All of that is churning in the back of my mind.\n\nIt can take weeks and even months to get the images I want. I was in Yellowstone for a year and got all the photos that were published in two weeks.\n\nWhen it comes to socializing - wolves, chimpanzees and bears aren't that different from humans.

That caravan has shrunk to less than 4,000 migrants, although it has become difficult to give exact numbers as migrants advance into small towns any way they can.\n\nAnother caravan, also of about 1,000 to 1,500 people, entered Mexico earlier this week and is now in Mapastepec, Chiapas. That group includes Hondurans, Salvadorans and some Guatemalans.\n\nIn addition, the government identified a smaller group of 300 Central American migrants walking further ahead, in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz.\n\nUncertainty awaits\n\nMexican officials appeared conflicted over whether to help or hinder their journeys.\n\nIn the smaller caravans, immigration agents and police have at times detained migrants. There has also been pressure on the main caravan, with federal police pulling over freight trucks that pick up migrants and forcing them off, saying that clinging to the tops or sides of the trucks was dangerous.\n\nBut several mayors have rolled out the welcome mat for migrants who reached their towns \u2014 arranging for food and campsites. Mexico's Interior Department says nearly 3,000 of the migrants in the first caravan have applied for refuge in Mexico and hundreds more have returned home.\n\nWith or without the government's help, uncertainty awaits.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has ordered U.S. troops to the Mexican border in response to the caravans.

(CBC)\n\nBut you can't hit the obsidian just anywhere \u2014 there's a bit of physics to it, Rast said.\n\nLook for a nice flat surface to hit it on; flakes like to travel along ridges, so position the hit above the ridge, knowing it will guide the shape of the flake.\n\nOnce your flake breaks off, use your hammer stone to brush up the edge and get rid of the leftover shards.\n\n\"Every time you take a flake off, it leaves a depression on the core, and you just wanna clean that up.\"\n\nHow can you tell a piece of obsidian was broken off in this manner? You'll see ripples that look almost like a vinyl record.\n\nThe cone of force on an obsidian flakes resembles the grooves on a vinyl record. (CBC)\n\n\"You find that on a beach, there's nothing in nature that creates that,\" said Rast.\n\n\"Just that flake alone will tell you that somebody was there working, somebody was flintknapping.\"\n\nStep 2: Once you make the flake\u2026\n\nTo make your flake into an arrowhead you need three tools, Rast said: a bit of leather to protect your skin from the sharp obsidian; the hammer stone to grind the edge; and a pressure flaker, like antler tines.\n\nRast said more advanced pressure flakers were used by some cultures, like the Dorset, who he said lived in Newfoundland about 2,000 years ago and would use a composite tool made up of a walrus tusk embedded into a piece of wood and lashed with sinew, most likely from caribou.\n\nRast says the Dorset in Newfoundland used a pressure flaker made of a walrus tusk embedded in a piece of wood, tied with sinew. (CBC)\n\nModern ones use a bit of copper in a wood handle. Rast said flintknappers use copper because it's a soft metal \u2014 harder metals would crush the edge of the obsidian rather than flake it.\n\nAssume your obsidian flake is really sharp, so use the leather to protect yourself from cuts \u2014 a common woe for flintknappers. Then, you'll use the hammer stone to brush the edges.\n\n\"Get rid of the really thin, sharp edge by using our stone to brush down.\"\n\n\"We want a thin, sharp edge at the \u2026 end, but that thin edge is a weak edge, so we want to kind of strengthen it up. And this also makes it safer for us to handle it.\"\n\nMake sure you brush down, not up, otherwise you'd be spraying glass fragments at yourself.\n\nStep 3: Bit by tiny bit\n\nNow comes the pressure flaking part of the task \u2014 the most time-consuming part of the process.\n\nFind the thinnest part of the edge; hold the flake in your hand, with the pointed end toward you.\n\nThe tip of the pressure flaker, you find a low spot, put some pressure on it, flick down and detach tiny shards.\n\n\"You're trying to thin it, you're trying to shape it.\u2026 You want to work toward a triangle shape,\" Rast said.\n\nAnd once it starts looking like an arrow\u2026\n\nHow long it takes you depends on how familiar you are with the process, and exactly what kind of arrow style you want, Rast said.\n\nCreating an arrowhead is a messy process, and a tarp to catch all the obsidian shards is handy. (CBC)\n\nIt takes him no more than an hour from start to finish to create a functional arrowhead.\n\nYou notch the wide end, attach it to the wood, and presto, you end up with an arrow.\n\nTo see the full process, check out this video with Rast:\n\nWith files from Tedd Blades and On The Go\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "A 55-year-old man has died in a single-vehicle crash in Cumberland Bay, N.B.\n\nAccording to a statement, Minto RCMP responded to the crash at 10:30 p.m. Friday night.

When one person is hurt in our community, through our moral and religious obligation, we are supposed to help,\" said Osman Khan, spokesperson for the Imdadul Islamic Centre, one of the groups behind the show of solidarity.\n\nLast Saturday, a gunman opened fire in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, killing 11 Jewish people, many of them elderly.\n\nSix people were also injured in the attack, including four police officers.\n\nThe accused shooter, Robert Bowers, allegedly made anti-Semitic remarks during the attack, according to police.\n\nIt was just the latest of a series of a high-profile shootings at places of worship on both sides of the border.\n\nJoanna Sadowski said she was a 'little bit overwhelmed' by the show of solidarity at seven GTA synagogues Saturday morning. (Keith Burgess/CBC)\n\nKhan said it only made sense for his community to express its condolences and support for Toronto's Jewry. In February 2017, some 300 Jewish people from across the GTA, along with many from other faiths, formed rings of peace around local mosques in the wake of a deadly attack inside a Quebec City mosque.\n\n\"It gave consolation to us in that difficult time, and now are doing the same,\" Khan said.\n\n\"Not because we feel we have to reciprocate, but because we feel a need to be with our brothers and sisters to ease the pain that they feel, because we share that pain.\"\n\nJoanna Sadowski, a member of the Holy Blossom Temple on Bathurst Street in York, said the public display of compassion was deeply emotional for her.\n\n\"It was very moving and very, very beautiful. I think I felt a little bit overwhelmed by the support of all the people who came out to show their solidarity,\" she said.\n\nMuslim community leaders recite an opening prayer and a welcome to all those who showed up at Holy Blossom Temple. The assembled group spoke about the kinds of violence that various religious groups face.

That's a value that we share as Canadians, as Torontonians \u2014 that we care and respect each other's differences.\"\n\nPhyllis Denaburg, also a congregant at Holy Blossom, took part in the circles of peace around GTA mosques last year. She said that beyond offering support, the events help connect people who might otherwise not have a chance to meet.\n\n\"It's definitely a message of solidarity and that we aren't alone. It's a shame that these things still continue to happen, because it's not something new. But it does warm our hearts,\" she said.\n\nHoly Blossom Temple's rabbi, Yael Splansky, has said that Toronto native Joyce Fienberg, who was killed in the Pittsburgh shooting, was a member of Holy Blossom Temple.\n\nFienberg spent most of her career as a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, retiring in 2008 from her job studying learning in the classroom and in museums. Before that she was a member of the Holy Blossom Temple community, which is one of Toronto's oldest Jewish congregations.\n\nSplansky said Fienberg was a \"very special person\" who was married at the temple and whose confirmation photo is on its wall of honour.\n\n\"I know there's a whole generation of Holy Blossom members who grew up here with her, who went to school with her and celebrated her wedding day here at Holy Blossom,\" said Splansky, who said she didn't know Fienberg personally.\n\nWith files from The Canadian Press", "It could have been a disastrous wager for Summerside native Jonathan Greenan, who appeared on Jeopardy Friday evening.\n\nBut luck was on his side.\n\nGreenan emerged victorious after his first night on the long-running game show.

Library chair Norma Hamlyn says looking at the pictures was like going back in time. (Courtesy Dr. Clement Hiebert and Twillingate Public Library)\n\nIn the early 2000s, a copy of Dr. Hiebert's memoir, Seldom Come By \u2014 A Surgeon's Stories, showed up at the Twillingate library.\n\nA gift from his family, the book told tales of his summer as a young doctor in the town, including his first home delivery \u2014 twins.\n\nEdgar Dove and his son Hardy lay out salt fish to dry in 1950. This is one of the photos Dr. Clement Hiebert took during his summer in Twillingate. (Courtesy Dr. Clement Hiebert and Twillingate Public Library )\n\nHamlyn wrote the family, thanking them for the gift. She received a note back telling her of the photos and other memorabilia they would send.\n\nThat was in 2007.\n\nThe files never did show up. After tidying her home recently, Hamlyn found the letter again and wrote Dr. Hiebert's wife May, to ask if she still had it all.\n\n\"Within a week, the package arrived.\"\n\nWorking to identify people in photo\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Hiebert took photos in and outside the hospital, including this photo during an operation. He writes it was in Twillingate where he knew he wanted to be a surgeon. (Courtesy Dr. Clement Hiebert and Twillingate Public Library) With the help of a couple of people in town, some of the people in the photos have been identified, but Hamlyn said it's been a challenge to name everyone.\n\n\"There are very few people [around] that would have worked at the hospital in 1950 and would know these people that still have good eyesight, good memory, and you'd have to be able to recognize,\" Hamlyn said.\n\n\"Some of these people in the pictures have moved on for years.\"\n\nBut she's inviting anyone else who may been able to help to come visit the library, even if it's just to have a look at the images \u2014 for example, the one of the hospital cow, standing on top of the hospital root cellar.\n\nThe Twillingate Hospital cow stands on top of the root cellar. The cow provided fresh milk to patients and staff, as it would be too expensive to buy in 1950.

And I think when you look at these pictures you can realize the affinity he had for people,\" Hamlyn said.\n\n\"He took pictures of ordinary people around town. And he said that it had a lifelong impact. It was a magical time for him.\"\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "A Nova Scotia victim of human sex trafficking is being remembered with a bursary in her name that aims to help survivors.\n\nThe Maddison Fraser Bursary was announced this week in London, Ont., by the London Abused Women's Centre and the London Police Association. The $2,000 annual bursary will be given each January to a survivor of human sex trafficking.\n\n\"To think that Maddison is going to be honoured every single year in a city that far away from here is just awesome, I love it,\" said Jennifer Holleman, Maddison's mother.\n\nHolleman told CBC News last year her daughter was lured from Yarmouth, N.S., to Alberta by violent pimps when she was 19.\n\nMaddison died in 2015 after a car crash in Edmonton. She was 21.\n\nHolleman was flown to London for the centre's Shine the Light on Women Abuse Campaign. She said the bursary announcement was a complete surprise.\n\n\"I've lost my child to prostitution, it's really a hard pill to swallow and it's been very difficult,\" Holleman said.\n\n\"But now things are changing so much and now she's going to be more so remembered as a face of change. ... With this bursary, that makes it even that much more real.\"\n\nMoney helping survivors\n\nMoney for the bursary is coming from the London Police Association.\n\n\"Police officers see how difficult it is for trafficked women and girls to leave,\" said Megan Walker, the centre's executive director. \"They see how controlled they are, and the level of violence experienced not only by their pimps but by sex purchasers.\n\n\"They wanted to do something that would make a difference in somebody's life.\"\n\nPositive way to be remembered\n\nWalker said the organization is always trying to help families find positive ways their children can be remembered.\n\n\"Maddison's story is really compelling,\" she said. \"She was a two-time Canadian boxing champion, a mom of a very young girl when she was killed, and it just really resonated with the police association.\"\n\nWalker said the bursary will help find housing for trafficked women, as well as rehab, job training and education.\n\n\"Really just to help those women and girls re-establish their lives,\" she said.\n\nWalker said Maddison's story hit a nerve.\n\nShe first heard it when she was invited by the Tri-County Women's Centre to speak at a conference two years ago in Yarmouth. Holleman was also speaking at the conference.\n\n\"She shared her story about Maddison and it really impacted me, like all of these stories do. So I went up to her after and asked if she would consider allowing us to honour Maddison.\"", "HBO is the latest to levy criticism at U.S. President Donald Trump for his use of particular slogans and music for political purposes, but that doesn't mean it will be taken further.\n\nThe network responded yesterday after Trump posted a meme with the words \"Sanctions are coming,\" an obvious nod to the famous Game of Thrones catchphrase, \"Winter is coming.\"\n\nThe photo, apparently referring to U.S sanctions against Iran, included a picture of the president with the popular fantasy series' signature font and gloomy-looking backdrop.\n\n\"We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes,\" HBO said in a statement sent to reporters yesterday.\n\nA tweet posted by the company on Friday said: \"How do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?\" Dothraki is a made-up language used on the show.\n\nHow do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki? \u2014@HBO\n\n\"They might try to criticize it but in normal circumstances, these types of issues are dealt with in cease-and-desist letters,\" said Los Angeles-based trademark lawyer Doron F. Eghbali, commenting generally on the topic.\n\nA representative for HBO told CNBC there would be no further steps taken.\n\nStop the music\n\nEarlier this week, a cease-and-desist letter was issued on behalf of musician Pharrell Williams, who slammed Trump for using his upbeat hit Happy at a campaign rally on the same day as the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nThe Grammy-winning artist, who endorsed Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate in 2016, claimed copyright and trademark infringement through his lawyer.\n\nIn 2016 before Trump won the presidency, the Rolling Stones demanded the politician stop using their songs, including Start Me Up and You Can't Always Get What You Want, to fire up crowds on the campaign trail. The year before, Aerosmith's lead vocalist Steven Tyler also told the then-presidential hopeful not to play its ballad Dream On.\n\nAdele, Neil Young and R.E.M are among the other musicians who have also protested the use of their songs at Trump rallies over the years. In the case of Neil Young and R.E.M, Trump stopped using their songs according to the Associated Press.\n\nDo artists have the right to say no?\n\nEghbali, a senior partner with the American business firm Law Advocate Group, LLP, says an artist's cease-and-desist demand in the U.S. depends on whether the singer-songwriter owns the work.\n\nHe says if an organization has paid to license the music, the music is fair game unless the organization's use of the song can be proven damaging to the musician.\n\n\"Unless there's a court order and unless the [campaign] isn't paying for it, there's not much the artist can do.\"\n\nIn the case of Aerosmith, Tyler's lawyer contended the use of the band's music erroneously implied their endorsement of Trump's candidacy.\n\nSome licence agreements allow songwriters or publishers to exclude certain songs from the overall blanket licence. A blanket licence is granted by the performing rights organizations ASCAP and BMI for access to all the music in their repertoire.\n\nWith files from the Associated Press", "Clients of Vancouver's Harrison Galleries say they too are missing art they gave to the gallery to resell on their behalf.\n\nEarlier this week, CBC reported that at least a dozen artists who sold their work through Harrison Galleries are trying to find paintings they had consigned to owner Chris Harrison.\n\nThe gallery represented more than 40 artists before closing its doors in April.\n\nCathy Forsyth bought her first painting from gallery founder Alex Harrison in 1983.\n\nWhen she wanted to sell two paintings in 2012 she contacted the gallery again, this time dealing with Alex's son Chris Harrison.\n\nOne painting was a large one by Jose Trinidad called Artist Garden June worth $14,500 and the other was by Allan Myndzak called Garden Arches, worth $4,000.\n\nForsyth says she checked in with Harrison regularly, wondering if her paintings had been sold. He told her they could be sold right away or years later as there had been 'lots of interest but no bites.'\n\nShe last spoke to Harrison in January or February this year and when she heard the gallery closed, she says she sent him several emails asking about her paintings but never heard back.\n\n\"If he has sold them I'd like the money owing to me and if he hasn't sold them I'd like the paintings back so I can make other arrangements for them,\" she told CBC in a telephone interview. \"They're very valuable paintings.\"\n\nChris Harrison took over Harrison Galleries from his father who opened it in 1958.

It's a large residential and office complex in Arlington, Virginia, just south of Washington, the Post said, citing unidentified sources.\n\nAmazon announced last year that the retail giant was looking to open a second headquarters somewhere in the North America, bringing with it as many as 50,000 new jobs. Several state and local governments, including Canadian cities, threw their hats in the ring, offering Amazon millions in tax incentives if they opened their new headquarters in their city.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe Washington metropolitan area was long considered a top contender for Amazon's second headquarters. Company founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos already had several connections to the Washington area. He's the owner of the Washington Post and owns a home in the area. When the company announced a list of 20 top contenders in January, it included both Washington as well as Montgomery County, Maryland, which is just north of D.C.\n\nCrystal City is served by a mass transit system and major highways, both qualifications that Amazon has said is required for its new headquarters as well.\n\nBecause Amazon is reportedly in \"advanced talks\" does not mean the deal is certain. Shortly after the Post published its story, Mike Grella, Amazon's economic development director posted on Twitter, \"Memo to the genius leaking info about Crystal City, Va., as HQ2 selection. You're not doing Crystal City, Va. any favours.\"\n\nToronto was the only Canadian city to make Amazon's shortlist for hosting its headquarters, but, if the Washington Post report is correct, it looks like hopes from Canada's largest city have been dashed.", "Why health experts say the teatox craze is unnecessary, and possibly harmful", "It was poignant and emotional at Leicester's first match on Saturday since owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died in a helicopter crash.\n\nThe tears shed by Kasper Schmeichel summed up the mood as a huge banner, a Thai flag with \"RIP Vichai\" and the Leicester badge, was unfurled before the English Premier League game at Cardiff.\n\nCardiff City observed a moment of silence for the late Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who was killed in a helicopter crash last week. 3:06\n\nSomehow, though, the goalkeeper and his teammates managed to put their collective grief to one side to focus on the football for 90 minutes and grind out a 1-0 victory.\n\nThere was a united feeling before the game when two big banners were pushed around the ground by both sets of fans. Floral tributes were laid on the pitch as the teams and coaching staff gathered in the centre circle for a minute's silence for Vichai, one of five victims last Saturday of the crash outside the club's King Power Stadium.\n\nLeicester then gathered in a huddle for Schmeichel's team talk and, whatever emotive words he used, they worked as Demarai Gray scored the only goal with a low finish in the 55th minute.\n\nHe used to come down at home games, have a joke and a laugh, always say, 'Want win and three points.'

It's a sign that he is seeking to galvanize the same group of voters that helped carry him to victory in 2016.\n\nTrump has largely eschewed the big metropolises for smaller cities. He has been to Tampa, Nashville, Cleveland and Houston \u2014 where the arenas could accommodate his crowds. But he's primarily been jet-setting to smaller places such as Elko, Nev., (population 20,078); or, Mosinee, Wisc., (population 4,023); or, Belgrade, Mont. (population 7,874).\n\nWhen Trump stops at Belgrade on Saturday, historical records suggest he will be the second U.S. president to visit the Montana town named after Serbia's capital city. In 2009, Barack Obama held a town hall in Belgrade to promote the Affordable Care Act.\n\nU.S. President Trump visits Belgrade, Mont., and Pensacola, Fla., on Saturday. On Sunday, he'll be in Macon, Ga., and Chattanooga, Tenn. On Monday, he'll stop in Cleveland, Ohio, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Cape Giradeau, Mo. (CBC)\n\nSince March, Trump has criss-crossed the country like a salesman with a set territory. The majority of his trips have been to just nine states. They are Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Indiana, West Virginia and Nevada.\n\nTrump won eight of those states in 2016, but not Nevada. And this year, seven of them feature a major Senate race with a Democratic incumbent. The former casino magnate has visited one city twice for the midterms: Las Vegas.\n\nIs Ohio still a bellwether state?\n\nIn Ohio, Democrats are hoping one of their most successful politicians ever can help halt statewide Republican domination.\n\nIncumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown's will seek a third term, running against Republican representative Jim Renacci in the Senate race.\n\nTrump's impressive 2016 presidential-race victory in Ohio has raised questions about the future of its traditional role as a bellwether state, defined as one that tends to vote for the winning candidate.\n\nTight race for Georgia governor\n\nAnother closely watched contest leading up to voting day on Tuesday is the tight gubernatorial race in Georgia, which hasn't elected a Democrat as governor since 1998.\n\nStacey Abrams hopes to become the first female and African American governor, running against Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state.\n\nWatch as Trump campaigns for Republicans in Montana:\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump campaigns for the Republicans in Montana and encourages supporters to get out and vote in the upcoming U.S. midterm elections. 0:39\n\nKemp has been pushing for tighter voter identification laws, while Georgia Democrats say that would make voting more difficult for legal citizens.\n\nThis past week, a federal district court judge in Georgia ruled against the Republican effort to reject certain absentee ballots.\n\nThe governor's race in Georgia has brought out some heavy hitters, with talk show maven Oprah Winfrey and former U.S. president Barack Obama both campaigning for Abrams.\n\nWill 'crazy Democrats' comment pay off?\n\nIn Missouri, the incumbent yet vulnerable Democratic senator is delivering a message that mixes a more centrist view with the unexpected.\n\nClaire McCaskill has said she would back Trump if he stopped a migrant caravan at the border.\n\nWatch as former U.S. president Barack Obama campaigns for Democrats:\n\nFormer U.S. president Barack Obama speaks to supporters in Atlanta and encourages them to vote ahead of the U.S. midterm elections. 0:53\n\nAnd speaking on Fox News last Tuesday, she decried \"crazy Democrats\" who \"walk in restaurants and scream in elected officials faces.\"\n\nPortrait of the U.S. Trump is seeing in final days of campaigning\n\nLower incomes: Trump has journeyed to counties where it's slightly more of a struggle to reach and stay in the middle class.\n\nOut of his scheduled rallies, 74 per cent are in counties with median incomes that fall below the national level. But he's brought tidings of a 49-year low unemployment rate and accelerated economic growth to places that mostly lag the median U.S. household income of $55,032 US.\n\nIn September, Trump went to Wheeling, W.Va. The typical household income in the county surrounding Wheeling is $41,986, or about $13,000 below the national level. The metro area has lost 818 jobs in the 12 months that ended in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And for West Virginia, coal mine jobs have declined this year after a hiring bump in 2017.\n\n\"Your state is booming like never before,\" Trump told the crowd in Wheeling. \"And our great coal miners are back to work.\"\n\nTrump has visited a few affluent counties. He stopped by Rochester, Minn., where incomes are high because of the presence of the world-renowned Mayo Clinic. And during a special congressional election in August, the president campaigned in Delaware County, Ohio, where the median household income of $94,234 is just shy of being double the national average.\n\nFewer college degrees: Just 18.1 per cent of the adults in Elko County, Nev., hold a college degree. That's compared to 30.3 per cent nationwide. Of the 43 places Trump is visiting, 28 have a below-average share of college graduates.\n\nElko's economy is unique because it relies on mining gold, instead of the office and health care jobs that often require a college diploma. The county has five active gold mines, according to the Nevada Commission on Mineral Resources. This makes it something of an outlier in a country where mining metal ore accounts for 0.03 per cent of all jobs.\n\nWatch The National's report on allegations of voter suppression in Georgia:\n\nThe state of Georgia is heading into the final days of a nationally watched governor's race that's been marred by allegations of voter suppression. The controversy stems mostly from a rule that assigns a \"pending\" status to voter registrations that have the slightest discrepancy with a state driver's licence database or a social security database \u2014 a rule that has left the status of 53,000 mostly black voters in limbo. 3:23\n\nTrump went to Elko in part to help push for the re-election of Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who is in a tight race against Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen. Heller flattered the president \u2014 and provided the lone reference to the local economy \u2014 by telling him, \"I think everything you touch turns to gold.\"\n\nWhen Trump has gone to more educated counties, it's often because they have a major college campus and venues where people can gather. Missoula is home to the University of Montana and 41.8 per cent of its adults are college graduates. The University of Missouri is in Columbia, where 46.8 per cent of adults hold college degrees.\n\nRace numbers: Other than his rallies at big cities, Trump has generally been in communities that are overwhelmingly white. The U.S. population is 73.3 per cent white, but almost three-fourths of the places where the president has stumped for midterms are above that average.\n\nIn the county surrounding Council Bluffs, Iowa, 88.7 per cent of the population is non-Hispanic whites. Trump told the crowd at his rally that Democrats would allow Central American gangs such as MS-13 to immigrate freely into the United States, a claim disputed by Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"They want to turn America, these Democrats \u2014 and that's what they want \u2014 into a giant sanctuary for criminal aliens and the MS-13 killers,\" Trump said.\n\nIn the area around Council Bluffs, 6.1 per cent of the population is of Mexican descent. About one per cent are from other Hispanic nations. By comparison, 17.3 per cent of the U.S. population is Hispanic.\n\nThe biggest outlier in Trump's schedule may be his rally Sunday in Macon, Ga. Its county is 53.9 per cent black, making it the lone place being visited by the president where minorities make up the majority of the population.\n\nTrump is going there to promote Kemp's gubernatorial candidacy.\n\nHow to watch CBC's midterm coverage on Tuesday:", "About 200 people protested outside a courthouse in Woodstock, Ont., on Saturday against the transfer of convicted killer Terri-Lynne McClintic from a federal prison in Ontario to an Indigenous healing lodge in Saskatchewan.\n\n\"Send her back!\" the protesters chanted at the rally.\n\nMcClintic, 28, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Tori Stafford, 8, in 2010 and was sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 25 years.

The girl's body was found three months later in a wooded area near Mount Forest.\n\nRafferty was sentenced to life in prison in 2012 for kidnapping, sexual assault causing bodily harm and first-degree murder in Tori's death.\n\nTerri-Lynne McClintic received a life sentence after she pleaded guilty to first-degree murder of Tori Stafford in 2010. (Canadian Press)\n\nThe protesters said they want the federal government to pass legislation, which they call \"Tori's law,\" that would ensure any person convicted of the murder of a child would spend his or her entire sentence in a maximum security prison.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said on Thursday that a review into the decision to move McClintic\u200b from the federal prison to the healing lodge will be coming shortly.", "A psychologist speaking at a Department of Health cannabis symposium in Fredericton says it takes more than just education on drug use to keep youth from consuming drugs.\n\nHarvey Milkman, a drug researcher and professor of psychology at Metropolitan State University in Denver and Reykjavik University in Iceland, said introducing youth to \"natural highs\" that come from sports, music and arts are important to keeping kids off drugs.\n\n\"The best approach to prevention is \u2026 helping people to see that there are better things to do,\" said Milkman.\n\n\"Education has its limitations,\" he added. \"It's necessary, but it's not sufficient.\"\n\nMilkman has seen first hand how drugs can affect a nation's youth and how activities can reduce drug use.\n\nWhile at Reykjavik University in the late 1990s, Milkman said Icelandic youth were using drugs and alcohol at an alarming rate, which caused societal issues.\n\n\"We had 42 per cent of the teenagers getting drunk within the last 30 days.\n\n\"I mean getting drunk. Drinking five or more in a row and getting really raucous and not really comfortably navigating the streets of Reykjavik.\"\n\nActivities curbed use\n\nSports, music and art are some of the activities that are offered to help keep youth from abusing drugs. (Radio-Canada )\n\nMilkman said increased alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use among Icelandic teens led to a sense that something needed to be done.\n\n\"The society just reached a boiling point and decided to make some changes,\" he said.\n\nMilkman said the government aggressively pushed youth to participate in after-school activities, funded by the state, in areas of sports, art and music.\n\nThe results of those moves were dramatic.\n\n\"We went from 45 per cent of the population that was abusing alcohol \u2026 now it's down to seven per cent,\" said Milkman\n\n\"Cigarettes have gone from 23 per cent to three per cent. [Cannabis] has gone also from 17 per cent to two per cent.\"\n\nParental role crucial\n\nThe Department of Public Health held a symposium on cannabis with educators from across the province this week. Harvey Milkman was the keynote speaker. He is a drug researcher and professor of psychology at Metropolitan State University in Denver, where cannabis is legal.

Federer saved both break points, and Djokovic whacked his racket into the ground, drawing the first and only boos of a titanic match.\n\nDjokovic jogged over to get a new racket and held his hands up as if to apologize to the unforgiving crowd, unhappy that a pique of rage interrupted their gourmet feast of tennis.\n\nBrimming with confidence in a season which has seen him go from No. 22 in the rankings in May to No. 1 when they are released on Monday, and in which he has added the Wimbledon and U.S. Open to his Grand Slam haul, Djokovic created pressure throughout.\n\nBut Federer saved every break point \u2014 12 of them \u2014 and secured the only break of the match in clinching the second set.\n\nThe shot of the match went to Federer in the eighth game. As Federer charged to the net, Djokovic hit a powerful forehand which clipped the net and flew to the left of Federer, wrong-footing him. From a seemingly impossible angle, and totally off balance, he scooped his racket behind his neck and flicked a volley over the net for a winner.\n\nUnruly fan\n\nFederer thrust his arms into the air, the crowd rose to their feet in sheer disbelief.\n\nEven by Federer's lofty standards, it was remarkable.\n\nBut after losing the match, Federer was left shaking his head. He was unhappy with someone in the crowd twice shouting \"out\" during the match-point rally.\n\n\"It's just unfortunate it happens and at the end you lose the point, the match,\" Federer said.\n\nStill, he retained a sense of irony.\n\n\"Thank God the rally ended,\" he said. \"It would have been five times if it continued.\"", "A Quebec City man who set his friend on fire while they were making alcoholic drinks has pleaded guilty to criminal negligence causing bodily harm.\n\nR\u00e9my Cr\u00eate, 28, appeared in a Quebec City courthouse Friday to enter the plea, but never explained what motivated him to do what he did.\n\nIn May 2017, Cr\u00eate and a male friend, who is also in his 20s, went to a local bar to find out how to make a cocktail called the sucker punch.\n\nIt contains vodka, Midori, and 94 per cent alcohol.

The Nisga'a were voting on whether to accept a ground-breaking treaty with the provincial and federal governments that was decades in the making.\n\n\"It's one of those events in the history of our nation that, to me, was extremely important,\" Gosnell said.\n\nThe Nisga'a voted in favour of the treaty \u2014 the first signed agreement in the province's ongoing modern treaty process. Unlike other provinces in Canada, most of the First Nations in B.C. never signed treaties or surrendered their traditional territories.\n\nThe agreement still had to go through the House of Commons and the Senate, which took another two years.\n\nIt gave them land title to about 2,000 square kilometres and paid nearly $200 million in compensation. It also gave them the right to govern themselves and no longer be under the jurisdiction of the Indian Act. The Nisga'a could form their own government, run their own health services and schools.\n\nThe Nisga'a Nation was the first to sign a modern treaty in B.C. 3:03\n\nIt was a controversial treaty that many, including some Nisga'a, disagreed with. Some said the Nisga'a had given up too much for too little.\n\nTwenty years later, some Nisga'a speak with pride about their right to self-govern. However, they also speak of the many challenges that come with that responsibility after decades of not having their own institutions in place.\n\nSome Nisga'a, like Joseph Gosnell's niece, Ginger Gosnell, say the lack of jobs and industry puts the nation's longterm viability at risk.\n\nTourism could be an answer, but she says there isn't enough infrastructure like hotels and restaurants to attract people to the remote area. And energy projects like an LNG pipeline are hotly contested.\n\n\"I think we probably have a best-before date in front of us where we're either going to make it or we're going to break it,\" Ginger Gosnell said.\n\n\"I think if the Nisga'a nation can't make it, then modern day treaty making is going to be a failed experiment.\"\n\n'The ability is there'\n\nAs soon as the Nisga'a vote went through, Joseph Gosnell's phone was flooded with calls from people who wanted to know when the new Nisga'a government would be in place.\n\nToday, Joseph Gosnell still likes to sit in the Nisga'a legislature to see the nation's leaders govern.\n\nNisga'a across B.C. were able to vote in the 1998 referendum on whether or not to accept the treaty. (CBC)\n\nHe's proud of what the Nisga'a government has accomplished, but decades of disenfranchisement leave room for improvement. Many leaders have no prior governing experience and have not attended post-secondary institutions, he says.\n\n\"But the ability is there, I know the ability to govern is there. And to me still improving today,\" he said.\n\nLack of revenues\n\nHis niece Ginger Gosnell, 40, says the nation's lack of jobs is her primary concern.\n\nGinger says she has seen improvements in health services and education now that the Nisga'a are in charge of them. But she worries there won't be any money to pay for them if there aren't any jobs.\n\nJobs create income, and income is taxed and brings in revenues \u2014 meaning the nation wouldn't have to draw as much from the reserves of its $200 million settlement.\n\nThere was a big celebration on the day the treaty was brought to Nisga'a for it to be initialled. The Nisga'a had been fighting for a treaty for more than a century. (CBC)\n\nStill, Ginger Gosnell is positive overall about the treaty \u2014 even though she voted against it 20 years ago.\n\nShe says she didn't think people fully understood the deal they were voting on.

I have been saving up that experience, relishing the anticipation, for libraries are places that inspire in me dream and delight.\n\nI have read and written and done research in dozens of libraries, from the Library of Congress in Washington (under the impressively domed Reading Room) to the British Library in London (now very bureaucratic), to the Nobel Library in Stockholm (a special privilege I was granted), to old Rutherford at the University of Alberta (where I wrote most of my undergraduate papers), to the Nose Hill branch of the Calgary Public Library system (which has the best view of any library in the world).\n\nI have definite feelings about all of them, although perhaps the most charming is the intensely independent London Library \u2014 a subscription library set up by Carlyle because he disliked the British Museum Library's rules.\n\nBut this love affair began on the prairies.\n\nModest beginnings\n\nThe first library that I frequented was in the modest central Alberta city of Camrose.\n\nThe building was once the courthouse, as its somewhat ostentatious columns proclaimed, and then became the library.\n\nWhen a new library was later built (through Lt.-Gov. Lois Hole's determined efforts), that old one became a Treasury Branch, then a caf\u00e9, and later was designated a historical building.\n\nThe historic library and former courthouse building in Camrose, Alta. (Jeffery J. Nichols/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nYet, my first library still prompts intense memories.\n\nI do not remember learning to read \u2014 I think I was born knowing the alphabet \u2014 but I can recall with absolute clarity the steps leading up to the main door, so steep that my child's legs could barely stretch from one to the next.\n\nThose high stairs came to symbolize the ascent that I associated with books \u2014 their capacity to transport me to different places and times. Emily Dickenson's lines, \"There is no Frigate like a Book/To take us Lands away,\" was certainly my prompt.\n\nInside, the library smelled of oiled wood, damp winter boots, the delicious dust of books \u2014 of thumbed pages, the linen-like texture of the protective binding, and the manila slot for the due-date card at the back, as official as time itself.\n\nI loved the atmosphere of stilly hesitation, the shelves and shelves of tantalizing spines with their embossed titles and authors' names.\n\nI set out to read every book in that library, and probably did, visiting once a week and taking out as many volumes as allowable. I loved too the furnishings, the gravity of the tables, and especially the librarian's desk, heavy oak, behind which she sat erect, wielding the imprint of her date stamp.\n\nIf European cities preserve cathedrals, and if American cities flaunt ostentatious courthouses, then we Canadians might claim to revere our humble hometown libraries \u2014 although they are often squat, utilitarian buildings, designed by government architects and as usefully nondescript as the old ALCB stores.\n\nCalgary has been loyal to both the graceful sandstone of 1912 Memorial Park Library and the brutalist Central Library of the 1960s.\n\nCalgary's old central library, photographed in 2008. (Calgary Public Library)\n\nBut the new Central Library is a different edifice, a declaration and a vindication, an outgrowth of our city's avid use of the library system.\n\nA gateway\n\nIt is the second largest in Canada.\n\nThere are more than 600,000 members, and 21 branches that support some 6.6 million visits each year \u2014 despite having one of the lowest per-capita funding ratios in the country. (And that is shameful.)\n\nCalgary library users here are so conscientious that during the 2013 flood, they kept returning books \u2014 little knowing that as they passed through the slot they slid down into the water-filled basement and drowned.\n\nFor five years, the new Central Library has been slowly growing and glowing behind City Hall. It is much discussed and approvingly measured as \"potentially under budget,\" despite its imposing elegance and the arches that mimic the rolling clouds of the Chinook.\n\nThe exterior assembled itself like a Tetris game, the interleaving glass spaces as hexagonal pages \u2014 an entire new cruise ship sailing into downtown. It is touted as a \"natural\" building, open and airy, a \"gateway\" to the formerly grubby East Village.\n\nA home to books\n\nOn Nov. 1, when the building is \"activated,\" the celebrations surrounding the opening promise to be fittingly flashy, worthy of its eloquent style.\n\nBut the real test will be whether the place can succeed not only as the community hub, meeting place and activity centre that it aspires to be, but as the home of books \u2014 those collections of words that instigate the \"sharing of knowledge\" that we talk about more than we practice.\n\nLibraries remark a culture's attention span, measure the temperature of what matters synchronically. Historically, libraries denoted wisdom and understanding \u2014 two ideals no longer common currency despite the technological advantages of this information age.\n\nThe notion of libraries as hoarding the bounty of high literature is long dead, and they have metamorphosed into civic centres that now declare how much the communities that libraries serve have changed.\n\nThis new library is rich in \"facilities\" that have little to do with shelves of books or the Dewey Decimal system.\n\nIt's about more than just grabbing a book and sitting down quietly, although it's also about that. (Dave Rae/CBC)\n\nIt boasts two caf\u00e9s, a performance hall, an interfaith room, a collective gaming area, a child-minding service, a \"Questionarium\" (I quizzically imagine a fish bowl with a Siri-type answering device), a digital commons, an idea lab, audio-video editing suites, and a room for nursing mothers.\n\nIt will provide public computers, free Wi-Fi, free printing and gender-neutral washrooms. The Bookscalator device, which transports materials between floors, will be worthy of Beakerhead attention.\n\nAll marvellous. All amazing. All spectacle.\n\nSomewhat dismaying fact\n\nThe public library is the new town square, dispensary and classroom \u2014 the most accessible of all civic buildings.\n\nThat everyone is welcome is a crucial aspect of its role, but that inclusivity disguises the somewhat dismaying fact that libraries have become outreach centres, service hubs for the dispossessed, the homeless, and the unemployed.\n\nThey fill the gaps that social services do not, providing key guidance and ESL classes for newcomers, teaching numeracy and literacy, programming lectures and talks and movies and panels.\n\nWillingly or not, they now wear the mantle of community arbiter, safety net, refuge and resource.\n\nI do not want to return to the library as a hushed and sacred space where no one dares to whisper. I certainly do not want to go backwards to the time (not so long ago) when users had to pay to join, and when libraries were not hospitable to the disenfranchised.\n\nEven if the image persists in our imaginations, the notion of a library as a rarified temple of erudition and illumination is long extinguished.\n\nBut on the home page of the new Central Library's website, the word \"Book\" appears only in the phrases, \"Room Bookings,\" and \"Book Donations.\" So it is with considerable relief that under the Explore Tab, I find \"Books\" at the top of the list.\n\nThe $245-million project occupies about 240,000 square feet of space in Calgary\u2019s East Village. (Dave Rae/CBC)\n\nThis library will have books, and books are still the mainstay of why libraries matter and why they should matter.\n\nOf course, there are also e-books and movies and music and newspapers \u2014 our access to information swollen with the virtual.\n\nThis is no lament for the physical object of the book and what it has come to represent in this uneasy age.\n\nThe need for books\n\nIn an interview, director of communications Mary Kapusta insists, \"We're all book lovers so we want book lovers to have a great place to research and read.\"\n\nA hundred-thousand more books will be added to the collection, bringing it up to 450,000 books.\n\nBut I worry about the busyness and the hectic determinations of programming leaving no space for dream and contemplation. About it leaving fewer and fewer opportunities enabling the happy accident of pulling a book off a shelf and opening it to discovery.\n\nOur curiosity deficit grows every day, so perhaps the greatest need the library must serve is instigating enquiry.\n\nThe Oculus Skylight, a metaphorical eye hovering over the core of the new building, surely suggests that reading enlightens \u2014 rather than the Orwellian eye of Big Brother.\n\nFrom the centre of the building, you can see all the way up to the sky. (Dave Rae/CBC)\n\nI am personally intrigued by odder details \u2014 that the building is engineered to support a live load (the weight of books) of 7.2 kilopascals. Is that a lot or not?\n\nI wonder about the library's straddling the LRT track and the potential effect of trains running underneath. Will the sound of trains provide the subterranean rush and roar that is so often heard in theatres above the Tube in London's West End? I am eager to see the public art around and within the library, particularly the Indigenous placemaking pieces, reflections of Moh'kinsstis and Treaty Seven people.\n\nThere are many reasons to celebrate this moment, not least because Calgary right now needs some joyful occasion, needs to imagine that we will pull ourselves out of this somewhat negative trough. The library, physical and present, speaks to our respect for smartness and its accompanying sophistication.\n\nWithout knowledge, we are but ciphers.\n\nAnd the proof will be in the performance.\n\nA library used is a library loved\n\nIt is up to us as citizens to \"use\" the library. For its best review will be in its employment.\n\nTo celebrate is not only to visit and to gawk, but to check out a book, take it home, and read it.\n\nAnd so, I have three suggestions.\n\nThe Library At Night, by Alberto Manguel.

Her disease had progressed to the point she could no longer walk or speak.

By policy, the organization refuses to facilitate medically assisted death and the provincial government, under Hoffman, has exempted Covenant Health from having to provide those services.\n\nFor more than a week, Hoffman has repeatedly refused to directly answer questions on Covenant Health's policy, which ethics and legal experts say is inhumane and infringes on patients' rights.\n\n'We told our story'\n\nBut Emmanuel said her family came away from the meeting with the sense Hoffman was not committed to forcing Covenant to change the policy, which they say is cruel.\n\n\"We told our story.

But the minister would not give any \"specific response\" to questions about what, if anything, she planned to do.\n\nCovenant has said it is reviewing the language in its policy \"related to the use of the term 'exceptional' in identifying patients who may require onsite MAID assessments.\n\n\"The interpretation of that word may not have been what was intended in some cases and we are reviewing to ensure improved clarity going forward,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIn an interview late Friday, Hoffman told CBC News she will be monitoring that review, \"and if I am not happy with the way that they have amended their policy, I will enact my own.\"\n\nShe did not commit to a further review by her ministry on patients' access to assisted dying services in religious facilities, including the procedures themselves.\n\n\n\nSecond patient forced onto street\n\nOn Friday, CBC News revealed another patient had to leave a Covenant Health facility to access MAID services.\n\nWhen Bob Hergott, a 72-year-old ALS patient, sought a medically assisted death in 2016, he was effectively paralyzed; he could only communicate by typing on a tablet with one functioning finger.\n\nHergott's best friend of 25 years, Verna Young, said Covenant told her friend he could not access any assisted-dying services on its property. Using one finger to steer his motorized wheelchair, Hergott had to leave the hospital and cross the street to a bus shelter so he could sign his form requesting an assisted death.\n\nYoung said the experience clearly upset Hergott, who eventually had to leave St. Joseph's Hospital, where he had lived for five years, for the assisted dying procedure that ended his life.\n\nShe said Hergott took a taxi to the Royal Alexandra Hospital, an Alberta Health Services facility.\n\nCovenant declined an interview request about Hergott's care. In a statement, the health provider said Hergott, who was the first Covenant patient to request MAID, regularly left the hospital for medical appointments and social activities. Covenant said his care team determined he could safely go off-site to access MAID services.\n\n'This is shameful'\n\nWhile Covenant has publicly apologized for its treatment of Nowicki, her family said the Catholic health provider has yet to privately apologize. Covenant continues to defend its MAID policy.\n\nIn a news release issued Friday, Liberal MLA Dr. David Swann urged Hoffman to enforce a patient's right to not only assessments but also to medically assisted deaths at Alberta's religious-based health facilities.\n\n\"(Covenant) will not even allow them to fill out paperwork at their facilities,\" the Liberal release said. \"This is shameful. This is also illegal.\"\n\nNowicki's family still hopes that, by speaking publicly, it will force change that ensures no other patient has to endure what she did.\n\n\"I told (Hoffman) that we weren't doing this for any profit or fame or fortune,\" Nowicki's husband Terry said. \"I said, 'We're doing this so nobody else will go through the same thing that we went through.' \"\n\nAdded Nowicki: \"And I believe she said that it shouldn't happen again, and she was sorry that it had happened. And that was the end of it.\"\n\nIf someone you know has had a similar experience, or you have information about this story, please contact us in confidence at cbcinvestigates@cbc.ca.\n\n@jennierussell_", "If Calgary hosts the 2026 Olympics and the Games go over budget, don't call on Ottawa for help.\n\nThat was the message from the federal government on Friday afternoon.\n\n\"The next step will be that plebiscite.

If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here.\n\nCanadians needing a jab in the arm might be scratching their heads about why they can't get certain vaccines these days.\n\nRight now some people are reporting they've had trouble getting the new high-dose flu vaccine for seniors, the new shingles vaccine, hepatitis A and B shots, and even the rabies vaccine.\n\nAnd for two years, travellers trying to get a yellow fever vaccine have faced delays in getting the shot, which is required to enter some countries in Africa and Asia.\n\nSo what's going on? Each vaccine has a different story. But the short answer is that either there has been a spike in demand somewhere in the world, or there has been a manufacturing problem that is interfering with supply.\n\n\"You don't necessarily know when there's going to be a shortage so you have to be quite agile to be able to overcome this,\" said Dr. Caroline Quach, pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical microbiologist at CHU Sainte-Justine in Montreal. \"Because you don't usually know until it's often a bit late.\"\n\n'It's been crazy'\n\nThe recent fluctuations in vaccine supply are making Daniela Mora's job even more hectic than usual. She is the national director for the Passport Health travel clinics, the largest chain of travel clinics in Canada.\n\n\"It's been crazy,\" she said, \"2018 has been the year that vaccines were in shortage.\"\n\nCanadians can get access to vaccines either through the public health system, including schools and doctors' offices, or through the private system, at pharmacies and travel clinics.\n\nWhen manufacturers face shortages, they sometimes allocate the limited supply to the public system first.\n\nSo when Canadians discover they need specific vaccines for foreign travel, they might be surprised to learn that their local travel clinic can't give them everything they need.\n\n\"Yellow fever is actually one of the most concerning ones because we do have actual outbreaks going on,\" said Mora.\n\nThe mosquito-borne virus can cause a serious and sometimes fatal infection. Current yellow fever outbreaks in Brazil and some African countries have caused an increase in global demand.\n\nSeveral countries require travellers to provide proof of yellow fever immunization before they can enter.\n\nHealth Canada warns Canadians \"to contact a designated Yellow Fever Vaccination Centre well in advance of their trip to ensure that the vaccine is available.\"\n\nThe yellow fever vaccine problems started back in 2016, because of a \"disruption of the manufacture of the drug,\" according to the Drug Shortages Canada website. The estimated end date for the shortage is listed as \"unknown.\"\n\nThat shortage, said Mora, is \"really tough\u2026 it's one of the only vaccines that's mandatory to get into certain countries.\"\n\nSpecial flu vaccine for seniors\n\nCanadians looking for the hepatitis A and B vaccines might also find they can't get them as easily as they thought. A combination of supply and demand problems have created shortages in many of the vaccines needed to prevent the viral liver infections when travelling abroad.\n\n\"With 30 clinics seeing hundreds of patients every week, it's been really tough. We have to allocate various doses almost on a daily or weekly basis. The demand is increasing,\" said Mora.\n\nBut it's not just travellers who are being told to wait. With the advent of flu season, there are questions in Ontario about the supply of a new high-dose vaccine recommended for seniors. Ontario is the only province to fund the vaccine \u2014 specifically made for people 65 and older \u2014 outside of hospitals and long-term care facilities.\n\nMiriam Harris, a Toronto senior anxious to get the vaccine, went to her doctor two weeks ago but was told they'd run out.\n\n\"They said 'call in every day' and that's what I have been doing,\" she said.\n\nBut Harris still can't find out when the vaccine will be back in stock. \"They don't know,\" she said.\n\nAfter she notified the provincial health ministry, demanding to know when she could get the vaccine, she received a personal email from the province's immunization unit assuring her that there is no shortage. Doctors simply need to reorder. The high-dose flu vaccine is not available in Ontario pharmacies.\n\n(The regular flu vaccine is available in pharmacies and there is no reported shortage.)\n\nPeople have also been calling Passport Travel Clinics looking for the high-dose flu shot.\n\n\"I'm hearing from a lot of clients that their family doctors ran out of it,\" said Mora.\n\n'Backorder' on new shingles vaccine\n\nSeniors who want to receive the new shingles vaccine might also encounter shortages because so many people are asking for it this year.\n\nAfter an intense marketing campaign which Second Opinion reported on last year, which saw bus and subway terminals covered with bright red ads for Shingrix, manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is trying to keep up with the demand.\n\n\"This high demand, coupled with variable timing for supply of additional doses, has created a temporary backorder status for the vaccine, which is expected to occur from time to time throughout the remainder of 2018 and into 2019,\" said GSK spokesperson Michelle Smolenaars Hunter in an email.\n\nShingrix will be distributed \"in a fair, equitable way,\" when more becomes available, she said.\n\nShingrix was heavily promoted in Canada starting in the fall of 2017, including ads in this Toronto subway station. Health Canada says advertising for vaccines is allowed because they are not considered prescription drugs. (CBC)\n\nRabies?\n\nA surprising name on the list of hard-to-find vaccines are those for rabies.\n\nRight now the two companies licensed to supply the rabies vaccine in Canada have reported shortages on Drug Shortages Canada.\n\nThe rabies vaccine is recommended for travel to some countries in Asia and Africa, where there is a risk of exposure from domestic dogs.\n\nSome health regions, including the Niagara Region, and the Northwestern Health Unit in Kenora, Ont., have issued notices about the rabies vaccine shortage.\n\nGSK's \u200bRabAvert is in short supply because of an unexpected increase in demand that happened when supplies of an alternate vaccine by another manufacturer ran low. GSK predicts it will have more RabAvert by the end of the year.\n\nSanofi Pasteur Ltd. is also licensed to produce the ImoVax rabies vaccine in Canada. On Drug Shortages Canada the company lists the reason for the shortage as \"disruption of the manufacture of the drug.\" That shortage is estimated to continue until next June with \"supply disruptions anticipated in the private market. Product is under allocation.\"\n\n'Chronic' problem\n\nFor doctors and public health officials, the rotating vaccine shortages are becoming a chronic situation.\n\n\"It's chronic in the sense that it happens from time to time but it's not always the same vaccine,\" said Quach. When it happens it's up to the federal and provincial health agencies to try to shift supply to where it's needed, or to come up with other substitution strategies.\n\n\"It's very difficult from a public health perspective and a physician perspective to foresee when it's going to come and what's going to come our way in terms of shortages.\"\n\nAnd there are limits to how quickly vaccine supplies can be manufactured.\n\nIt's a complex process that can take between 10 and 26 months, according to Smolenaars Hunter.\n\n\"Every batch of GSK vaccines is subject to extensive review and only product that meets rigorous standards and regulations are released into the marketplace.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Health Canada said in an email that the department \"recognizes the importance of vaccines and the impact that supply disruptions can have on many Canadians and the healthcare system.\"", "The American Museum of Natural History in New York City is launching a multi-year project to restore and conserve a section that highlights First Nations cultures of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nNuu-chah-nulth artist and historian Ron Hamilton, known as Haa'yuups, of the Hupacasath First Nation in B.C.'s Alberni Valley, was recently named co-curator of the project, which is housed in the museum's Northwest Coast Hall.\n\nHaa'yuups will provide input on all aspects of the exhibition's design, enrichment and interpretation.\n\n\"Every one of those wonderful, beautiful objects reflect a wonderful, beautiful mind and a wonderful, beautiful view of the world where people see themselves as part of a whole,\" Haa'yuups told CBC's Francesca Bianco of the museum's collection.\n\nHe will also help the museum avoid any wrong turns in the restoration process.\n\nOver 10,000 objects on display\n\nOpened in 1899, the Northwest Coast Hall's artifacts and objects were acquired by the museum during the late 1800s and early 1900s from different Northwest Coast communities.

Ivan Zinger, Canada's correctional investigator who serves as an ombudsman for the system, said those who chronically self-harm need to be seen by health-care professionals rather than security staff.\n\nUse of force refers to the physical tactics employed by authorities to enforce compliance. Pepper spray, segregation and restraints are all considered uses of force.\n\n\"This is not good,\" said Catherine Latimer, executive director of the John Howard Society, alluding to the high number of incidents at the Edmonton and Saskatoon prisons. \"It indicates that there is a heavy reliance on use of force when dealing with people who are already diagnosed with mental health issues.\"\n\nUnderstaffed, insufficient skills\n\nThe annual report released this week by Zinger focused on the five in-patient mental health facilities run by Correctional Service Canada (CSC) countrywide, including the psychiatric hospital in Saskatoon where Edmonton inmates are sent. Zinger cited findings from another report commissioned for the CSC by Dr. John Bradford.\n\n\"The Bradford Report, in my view, casts serious doubts on whether the RTCs could still meet health care accreditation and designation criteria by the provinces as \"psychiatric hospitals,\" Zinger told CBC.\n\nThe report found the psychiatric hospitals are understaffed, with clinical staff-to-bed ratios at the facilities well below acceptable standards.\n\nA restraint system used by security staff in federal prisons and psychiatric hospitals. (Office of the Correctional Investigator) \"These low staffing ratios to patient needs can result in the overuse of segregation and clinical seclusion practices,\" according to the report. \"Correctional and mental health staff lack the skill sets required to deal with forensic patients\" and assessment tools to screen for mental health conditions are \"limited or not clinically relevant.\"\n\nOne case study examined the care of a patient with 200 documented incidents of self-injurious behaviour who was subjected to use of force interventions 50 times.\n\nWhen the patient attempted to self-injure while strapped to a restraint bed, a correctional officer used pepper spray.\n\n\"The Office found that this use of force was inappropriate and unnecessary,\" wrote Zinger. \"An internal use of force review suggested that correctional staff were stressed and burned out from supervising the patient.\n\n\"Patients with this level of need should be treated in a facility designed for this purpose, where responses are health care-driven and mental health professionals conduct interventions and monitoring of patients instead of security personnel.\"\n\nIt's a treatment centre. How is there a lack of resources? I was sent here for this purpose - Brook McCargar\n\nThose findings come as no surprise to Brook McCargar, a former inmate at Edmonton Institution and the RPC, who says he chronically self-harms to alleviate boredom, to interact with \"normal' people at the hospital and to protest conditions of confinement.\n\nMcCargar has been locked up in solitary confinement for more than 2,000 days, or five-and-a-half years in total, over 27 placements, since entering federal custody in March 2012. Critics say solitary can exacerbate self-harming behaviour.\n\nDocuments show that more than half the time McCargar spent in segregation was at the Edmonton Institution. He was also segregated for 10 days at the RPC in 2013. McCargar said he also spent a few months at the psychiatric facility in Saskatoon earlier this year.\n\n\"There were six uses of force on myself in a span of a month, even though I was citing to them their own policy and law, including commissioner directive 567, the engagement intervention model which is supposed to ensure that force is used as a last resort, not a first,\" McCargar recently told CBC News.\n\nMcCargar said when he requested counselling, he was told there was a lack of resources.\n\n\"It's a treatment centre. How is there a lack of resources? I was sent here for this purpose. It makes no sense,\" he said.\n\nNo redress for prisoners\n\nThis week some prisoner rights lawyers called for a public inquiry at Edmonton Institution, where allegations about abuse of prisoners and staff by guards have repeatedly surfaced.

Seizures of the drug rose from roughly 40 incidents in 2012 to more than 480 in 2016. In the first month of 2018, police had already seized nearly half the total confiscated in all of 2017.\n\nThe number of people going to Winnipeg hospitals because of methamphetamine rose by 1,200 per cent over the past five years \u2014 218 meth-related visits in April 2018 from 12 in April 2013 \u2014 according to the city's health authority.\n\nAmid concerns about alcohol and substance use, many families are desperate for more supports, mental health and harm reduction services to help their loved ones recover.\n\nBut what recovery actually looks like may be different for different people. Experts, from scientists and researchers to people with lived experiences of addiction, say it's no simple thing to define. Sobriety, relapse, moderation and substitutions \u2014 think methadone in place of heroin \u2014 are all elements of various takes.\n\nRick Lees, executive director of Winnipeg's Main Street Project, said at the individual level, people need to define what recovery means for them. But a lack of a working definition can pose problems for policymakers and getting the various groups to work together.\n\n\"Nobody's really landed on what that is, and part of the reason \u2014 again, from my personal opinion \u2014 is that we haven't really clearly defined, what is recovery? What does that look like, how will we know it when we see it?\" he said.\n\n\"Because I don't think we as a society necessarily spend time talking about, what does recovery look like and what is it \u2014 we struggle to create consistent and cohesive plans.\"\n\nMichael Ellery, clinical psychologist and addictions researcher\n\nMichael Ellery, a clinical psychologist and addictions researcher in Winnipeg, said one of the common misconceptions about recovery is that abstinence is the only acceptable goal. That's not a given, he says, and he begins his work with clients by asking if that's what they want, and if it makes sense for them.\n\nWithout a single definition of recovery, he generalizes it like this: decrease impairment, increase quality of life.\n\nWith a variety of opinions in the field about how to get there, Ellery said it's important to focus on what's proven to work, whether it's an abstinence-based model, a harm reduction model or something in between.\n\n\"There are lots of different scientifically-based things that work,\" Ellery said. \"Things like participation in a mutual aid society [like the 12-step program] ought to be included in that.\"\n\nDisagreements among people who work on these problems is a good thing, he said: it helps hash out the nature of the beast. They create challenges, though, including making social science and policymaking more difficult.\n\nPhil Goss, peer counsellor, sober for 30 years\n\nPhil Goss started drinking when he was 12. In the years that followed, he became addicted to alcohol, then heroin and meth. He didn't stop using until he was close to 40. Now he's about to turn 70 and hasn't used since.\n\nGoss is a peer counsellor at Winnipeg's Main Street Project, a low-barrier shelter, detox and support centre. He says he preaches a harm reduction approach to addressing addiction. But for him personally, it has meant complete abstinence.\n\nPhil Goss is a peer counsellor at Main Street Project, and has experienced addiction himself. He supports a harm reduction approach, although he says his own version of recovery has meant total abstinence. (Aidan Geary/CBC)\n\n\"Total abstinence is the only way that I can fly, when it comes to a definition of recovery for me,\" Goss said. In his experience, slip-ups have sent him spiralling.\n\nBut Goss said relapse is part of recovery: it's a learning process. What's more, it's a process that is never complete.\n\n\"You're never cured. It can jump up and bite you in a heart beat. [You're] always learning,\" he said. \"It never ends.\"\n\nA new reality\n\nLees said recovery is about creating a new reality \u2014 not necessarily returning back to whatever life you lived before you started using.\n\nTo address addiction, he's more focused on dealing with the side effects and root causes of addiction than sobriety.\n\n\"[Recovery] may not include abstinence, but may include balancing the other aspects of a person's life that spin out of control because of the addiction \u2014 so that the addiction is no longer the controlling factor.\"\n\nLees said he wants people to stop moralizing addiction and focus on treatment.\n\n\"At the end of the day, that won't get us anywhere.\"\n\nKathleen Keating-Toews, Addictions Foundation of Manitoba\n\nKathleen Keating-Toews, an education and research specialist at the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba, said recovery happens on a continuum. Abstinence is at one end, but it's not the goal for everyone.\n\n\"For one person, recovery could look like completely stopping use, while another person has a goal to use substance in moderation,\" she said. \"At AFM, we look at harm reduction as part of that continuum of recovery.\"\n\nKathleen Keating-Toews said recovery is a transition that happens on a continuum, and it means different things for different people trying to achieve it. (Trevor Brine/CBC)\n\nInstead of a definition of recovery where it's interchangeable with sobriety \u2014 that is, removing of a substance from somebody's life \u2014 Keating-Toews suggests looking at recovery in terms of what's added in.\n\n\"When people are in recovery, they often report improvements to their life areas, such as enhanced self esteem, perhaps improved relationships with their friends and loved ones, better overall health \u2014 and that includes their mental and their physical health,\" she said.\n\nRecovery isn't black and white, and it's not all-or-nothing, she said. Relapses and setbacks are part of the transition, and they can actually help people manage in the long-run.\n\nThe concept is hard to define because it's complicated and highly individual, she said, and tends to evoke strong opinion. But however you define it for yourself, she stressed that recovering from addiction is, ultimately, possible.\n\n\"Recovery is achievable. But it's not going to look the same to everyone,\" she said. \"We know that even small changes that people make can make a very big difference in people's lives.\"\n\nCraig Falconer, sober for nearly two months\n\nCraig Falconer started drinking as a teenager, and got into opiods and crack cocaine from there. Now 49, he's been clean for 53 days, thanks in part to help from a 31-day detox at Main Street Project and support from the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba.\n\nFor Falconer, recovery means a total lifestyle change: it includes sobriety, but it's more than that, too. For him, it included getting away from some old behaviours and relationships.\n\nCraig Falconer had been sober for 52 days when he spoke to CBC News on Friday afternoon. He said some people have misconceptions that people with addictions can't change. (Aidan Geary/CBC)\n\n\"It means being sober, but it also means facing life's challenges when you are sober,\" he said. \"There will be obstacles and disappointments. It's how you handle them.\"\n\nFalconer said he sees lots of misconceptions about addiction and recovery in the general public.\n\n\"They see an addict or an alcoholic and they think they can't change,\" he said. \"I consider it a disease. It's treatable.\"\n\nBut Falconer doesn't think of recovery as something you finish and then move on from.\n\n\"It's something you maintain,\" he said. \"You've got to maintain it every day.\"\n\nDr. Erin Knight, director of hospital addictions program\n\nDr. Erin Knight, the medical director of Winnipeg's Health Sciences Centre's addictions program, says she takes a medicalized view of addiction and recovery. Addiction is viewed as a chronic disease, with periods of stability \u2014 which some would equate with recovery \u2014 and instability or relapse.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is provide that ongoing stability, so that relapses can be minimized and people can stay in that recovery for the majority of the time of their life,\" Knight said.\n\nTotal recovery doesn't equate one-to-one with abstinence to Knight. It may include a prescribed substance in place of an illicit one, like substituting methadone or Suboxone in place of heroin.\n\n\"On the converse \u2026 people who are abstinent from all substances but haven't gotten back a focus on overall wellness and recovery of the important things in their lives, may be abstinent from substances, but aren't truly in a stable, long-term recovery,\" she said.\n\nFor people trying to attain it, Knight said recovery should be defined by the individuals and their goals. But among researchers and policymakers, disagreements about abstinence's role in recovery may be problematic if they prevent access to evidence-based care, like methadone clinics.\n\nMyron Bateman, sober for roughly two months\n\nMyron Bateman, who lived with addiction for roughly a decade from his 20s into his 30s, had been clean for 60 days exactly on Friday. To him, the first definition of recovery he could think of was simple: freedom.\n\n\"Recovery to me means success,\" he said. \"Means you won the battle. The nightmare's over.\"\n\nMyron Bateman had been sober for 60 days when he spoke to CBC News on Friday afternoon. He hopes to start his own business in the future. (Aidan Geary/CBC)\n\nBateman had never tried to stop using before he began his two-month streak. On Friday afternoon, he felt confident he was well on his way. He's already planning his next move: starting his own siding and construction business.\n\nBateman said it's OK that there are a variety of takes on what recovery means. He knows what it means to him.\n\n\"I think it just means you're free,\" he said. \"There is a way out.\"", "Olympics boosters in Calgary are taking another kick at the can, 30 years after the city hosted the 1988 Winter Games.\n\nOn Nov. 13, Calgarians are scheduled to vote in a plebiscite whether they agree the city should put forth another bid, this time for the 2026 Games.\n\nThe effort is facing some headwinds, though, from a city council that is losing its enthusiasm for pursuing the bid further.\n\nCBC NEWS | Calgary Olympic Games Plebiscite Town Hall\n\nIf Calgary keeps going with its bid, however, it's a city that knows what to expect, as it has been down this road before \u2014 four times, in fact, to win the privilege of hosting the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe bid committee presented an animated slide show they hoped would impress the IOC.

The sighting is only the second time on record that a sperm whale has been seen so far North.\n\nHe says they've heard the call of sperm whales on their recordings before, but because the whales are known to have an extremely loud vocalisation, Laforest says it was assumed they were located further away in Baffin Bay.\n\nHe says it was \"really shocking\" to see these southern whales, so close to Pond Inlet and so close to freeze up.\n\nWith their fleshy dorsal fins, sperm whales are not adapted to the ice conditions of the Arctic waters, said Laforest.\n\n\"When we think about the whales that live in the Arctic year-round, such as bowhead, narwhal and beluga \u2026 they all have a bony ridge [on their head.]\n\n\"When the ice is forming, that fin [on sperm whales] will get in the way, whereas narwhal and bowheads can actually break ice and continue breathing.\"\n\n(CBC News)\n\nSouthern whales moving North\n\nHe says the whales have probably gone back south now, but their presence indicates the habitat near Pond Inlet and other Arctic communities is becoming \"more open for them to exploit in terms of accessing food.\"\n\nLaforest says that's good news for sperm whales, but may not be so great for Arctic species like bowhead \"which traditionally live without much competition because of their intense adaptation to live in a relatively harsh environment.\"\n\nHowever, Laforest says he doesn't think the ecosystem is on the \"verge of catastrophe,\" partly because sperm whales are not predatory.\n\nA group of sperm whale in the Indian Ocean.

And we have to have more communications so that we will have a better understanding of one another and respect one another as well.\"\n\nThe collection includes language apps and other resources for children, including an animated short by Fran\u00e7oise Hartmann that tells the tale of the great spirit Glooscap and how he battled with the giant Winter to bring Summer to the North and the Mi\u2019kmaq people. (Summer Legend. 1986 \u00a9 National Film Board of Canada)\n\nThe collection also includes a number of National Film Board productions about contemporary issues, such as the violent dispute over the burgeoning Indigenous fishery in Esgenoopetitj in the early 2000s.\n\nThere are CBC News items, language-learning apps for adults and children, and interactive maps with Wabanaki legends, to name just a few offerings.\n\nAnother of the commission's calls to action is \"developing and implementing kindergarten to Grade 12 curriculum and learning resources on Aboriginal peoples in Canadian history, and the history and legacy of residential schools.\"\n\nGeorge Daley, the president of the New Brunswick Teachers' Association, said that organization hadn't known the collection was in the works, but the Education Department has given its seal of approval.\n\n\"It is an appropriate resource for our New Brunswick teachers to supplement their curriculum,\" Daley said.", "An overnight fire in an Oakville, Ont., low-rise condo building has displaced five residents, a fire official says.\n\nNo one was injured in the blaze early Saturday, but several residents were treated on scene for minor smoke inhalation, according to Halton Regional Police.

Artists from Cezanne to Michelangelo to Picasso have painted them.\n\nI'll admit, I'm no pomologist \u2014 that's a person who studies the science of fruit \u2014 but I do eat my apple every day.\n\nHistorically speaking you can't think apples without thinking about Adam and Eve. In the Old Testament's Book of Genesis, guess what? The word apple never appears.\n\nThe word fruit hangs from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. In Hebrew, the word fruit can mean anything from an apple to a grapefruit, or an apricot to a pomegranate.\n\nAn Adam's apple is that bump that sticks out on men's throats and the story goes that the apple that Adam shouldn't have taken a bite of \u2014 but did \u2014 got stuck in his throat.\n\nIt could easily have been Adam's pomegranate.\n\nBates says that apple in your grocery store, the one with the shiny gorgeous peel, could easily be a year old. (Wanita Bates)\n\nAn ancient fruit\n\nApples are in the rosaceae family. This rose family includes pears, plums, cherries, strawberries and almonds. DNA has determined that apples originated in Central Asia. To be exact, it's where Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and China meet in the Tian Shan Mountains. Dried apples were found in a tomb dating back to 2500 BC.\n\nThis fall, as I visited our family cemetery in the Laurentian Mountains, I met a man who told me he was feeding bears. He reached into the pocket of his plaid jacket and took out a dusty, deep red apple and passed it to me from dirty black hands.\n\nI'll admit, I'm no pomologist \u2014 that's a person who studies the science of fruit \u2014 but I do eat my apple every day. - Wanita Bates\n\n\"Is this a Macintosh?\" I asked. He shrugged and said it came from a tree in his yard. With 7,500 different varieties of apples in the world, I wasn't about to start guessing.\n\nI looked towards the forest and suddenly felt like I was in a Far Side cartoon. I imagined hungry bears gawking out at the short, round woman holding one of their apples saying, \"I think I'll eat the apple for dessert.\"\n\nSpeaking of eating apples, according to Statistics Canada in 2017, we ate 10.4 kilograms of apples each. That's just under 23 pounds per person.\n\nIt's been worked out that it equals 86 apples per person.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, we each ate 10.4 kilograms of apples in 2017.\n\nI love my apples, I mean they're fat-, sodium- and cholesterol-free. Why, I'd go out on a limb and say they're also gluten-free.\n\nDon't peel them \u2014 eat that peel, that's where the fibre and antioxidants are.\n\nAbout 60 per cent of our apples are eaten out-of-hand. The remainder are processed into products like pie filling, cider and apple butter.\n\n'The American apples are coming'\n\nRight now at stores it's Canadian apple time. Great news, but Kristie Jameson, executive director of Food First NL reminds me that,\"90 per cent of our fresh fruit and vegetables are imported\" into Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nNinety per cent!\n\nI ask my produce people what this means and they say, \"The American apples are coming, the American apples are coming,\" meaning November and December.\n\n\"I think there is always opportunity for us to challenge ourselves to eat as seasonally as we can,\" said Jameson. \"Then to also take on different home-based activities to help us preserve food for longer into the season whether that be a root cellar or bottling products.\"\n\nHello apple jelly.\n\nHere is late breaking news from the apple orchard: for the first time in 50 years, Gala has overtaken Red Delicious as the leading variety by production for the 2018 harvest season.\n\nThe apple of my eye, by the way, is Honeycrisp or Sweet Tango!!\n\nFreshly picked? Don't make me laugh (or cry)\n\nWanita Bates says if you turn your nose up at six- to 12-month-old apples, you'll have to pick them off the tree yourself. (Wanita Bates)\n\nApples are ancient, but the technology applied to them today is space age. Not to cast aspersions on U.S.-grown apples, but honestly, by the time they get here they've had more work done on them than Kim Kardashian.\n\nMother Nature, this may hurt your peelings, but that apple in the grocery store, the one with the shiny gorgeous peel, could easily be one year old.\n\nHere's the tumultuous trek that an apple will make before it hits the produce aisle.\n\nApples are mainly hand-picked to prevent bruising. As soon as that happens, the rush is on to get them into cold storage as quickly as possible.\n\nThey are washed in a soap and chlorine solution where the apple's natural waxy coating is chemically removed.\n\nThe apple is then recoated in an edible wax that helps preserve them and make them shiny. We consumers like our shiny apples!\n\nThe apples are put on a conveyor belt where they are photographed and analyzed by computer to check shape, consistency and colour.\n\nImperfect fruit doesn't get shipped\n\nConsumers don't want to eat ugly, different-shaped fruit so those apples are discarded. They taste the same, but consumers aren't buying it.\n\nThe apples are sorted into Class 1 apples, which will be sold loosely, and Class 2 apples, which are bagged. Class 2 apples are considered lower quality but you pay more for them because they've been prepackaged.\n\nAll the apples are loaded onto palettes and shipped off to a cold storage facility where they could be stored for the next six to 12 months in an airtight room at 0 C.\n\nThe oxygen levels in the room also artificially lowered from 21 per cent to 1.2 per cent to further slow down the aging process.\n\nEssentially, this stops the apples from breathing and puts them to sleep.\n\nA company in the U.S. has invented a synthetic gas that that is used worldwide to keep fruits fresh. It's been used for years now in the United States, the European Union and China, the largest producer of apples in the world. This gas inhibits the production of ethylene which is the natural ripening agent that eventually causes apples to rot.\n\nIf you turn your nose up at six- to 12-month-old apples, you'll have to pick them off the tree yourself.\n\nThink about that the next time you pick up an apple for a snack.\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "When my three sons were small and still believed every word I said, (unlike now, when most of my utterances are greeted with eye-rolls, shrugs and disgusted groans), I had a handy trick.\n\nWhen they wanted me to allow them to do something inappropriate, I'd tell them that I'd lose my \"Mommy Licence\" if I did.\n\nOh, the reactions I'd get: horror, shock, gasps of disbelief. I didn't say it too often, just once in a while to redirect their attention to something more productive than eating ice cream for breakfast or staying up till midnight.\n\nHowever, I'm thinking that parenting licence thing might be worth a try, considering the goofiness I read online yesterday.\n\nThe story implied that it's not enough to give birth to your kids, clothe them, feed them, educate them, entertain them and drive them all over hell's half acre on the regular. Nor is it enough to let them suck the juice out of you like a Slurpee in July, leaving you a wizened husk of your former self. Ahem.\n\nNo folks, even that isn't enough to keep an outside entity from swooping in to tell you how you're messing up as a parent.\n\nWinnipeg's Child and Family Services agency paid a visit to a mother who had let her seven-year-old and three-year-old walk to the bakery one day last July.\n\nIt was a two-minute walk. Around the corner. In their own neighbourhood. To a place where they were known and knew the shopkeeper\n\nTo be clear, this was no long, dreary trek through the wilds. It was a two-minute walk. Around the corner. In their own neighbourhood. To a place where they were known and knew the shopkeeper.\n\nTheir mom was actively listening to make sure they were okay, ready to run to them if needed. (In contrast: I used to walk to kindergarten alone each day for the better part of half an hour, albeit when dinosaurs roamed the earth.)\n\nCFS had a report regarding this arduous journey and decided to inform the mother in question that she shouldn't let her kids go out unaccompanied until at least age 12. 12.\n\nWhat in God's name are we DOING to our children?\n\nSince when did a few minutes' walk on a summer's day in your own neighbourhood turn into a foray into enemy territory? Are our kids so utterly fragile that we can't chance them being out of sight for even two minutes?\n\nIs the world so much more dangerous now than when I was little?\n\nBaby in a box\n\nI have a hard time believing that, considering I grew up in the good old days without mandatory seatbelts or bike helmets.\n\nMy mom and dad brought my brother home from the hospital in a cardboard box on the front seat of their half-ton, for pity's sake.\n\nMy neighbour's mom used to bake a quarter into her birthday cake each year as a prize. Of course, it was wrapped in plastic, for sanitary reasons. Or to make it stick in the \"winner's\" gullet easier. Take your pick.\n\nWhat I'd like to know is since when does CFS have so much time on its hands that it can start handing out parenting advice to families that aren't in crisis?\n\nI was under the impression from news stories in recent years that the agency is hard up for resources, workers, foster families and actual space to house the children they rescue.\n\nTo me, \"crisis\" involves profound and/or imminent danger, not strolling to get a cruller.\n\n'Enough on their plate'\n\nDon't get me wrong. I am grateful to CFS, to the agencies like it and to the people who spend their lives working for the betterment of folks who are dealing with the grim realities of life, including crime, poverty, drug addiction and abuse.\n\nUnquestionably, it takes a special kind of human being to actively seek out harm and work against it, to stand up to darkness rather than turn a blind eye to it.\n\nWithout their continued efforts, our society would be in far worse shape than it is now, and for that, my hat is off to them.\n\nThat being said, I am equally certain that CFS workers have enough on their plate without investigating non-issues like this one.\n\nIn our painfully politically correct world, we need to give our collective heads a shake and look at what we're doing to our children by disallowing them even the tiniest slice of freedom.\n\nThe world was a harsh place when I was growing up, too. Kids disappeared, were abused, went hungry and had horrible parents, just like nowadays.\n\nThe sad truth is that human nature hasn't changed. We just hear more about the horrors, thanks to social media.\n\nTreating our children like Faberge eggs isn't going to keep them safe.

And can it provide better justice for victims, offenders and society as a whole?\n\nThe research says yes.\n\nRestorative justice focuses more on the rehabilitation of the offender of a crime, and reconciliation with the victims, and less on punishment. It focuses on repairing harm, the potential for healing in victims, meaningful accountability of offenders and preventing further crime.\n\nIt is a voluntary process for both the victim and the offender. Typically, the offender is required to acknowledge or accept responsibility for their actions in order to access the program.\n\nRestorative justice can take many forms and varies widely from community to community, but it can include mediation programs and restitution agreements, including community service, financial compensation and service to the victim.\n\nThe focus of restorative justice is on rehabilitation of offenders, and less on punishment. Offenders usually must acknowledge or accept responsibility for their actions in order to access such programs, which are voluntary for both the victim and the offender. (Shutterstock)\n\nResearch shows restorative justice tends to be more efficient and cost-effective than the traditional justice system \u2014 and it reduces repeat offences.\n\nThere are currently almost 500 different such programs running in communities across the country, primarily for youth offenders.\n\nWe recently held a Senate open caucus forum on the issue and experts from across the country emphasized the need for Canada to further explore restorative justice.\n\n\"It's much more than a different way of getting justice done, but a different way of understanding what doing justice actually requires,\" Jennifer Llewellyn, professor at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, told the forum.\n\nChantell Barker, the justice development co-ordinator at the Southern Chiefs' Organization, which represents 34 southern First Nation communities in Manitoba, told the forum that restorative justice is more in line with traditional Indigenous models of justice that have an emphasis on healing root causes and the restoring of harmony, allowing an offender to learn from their mistakes and to make amends for their behaviour.\n\n'I didn't want to create any more victims'\n\nWhen Ryan Beardy spoke, the room sat in quiet attention.\n\nEighteen months ago, Beardy was released from prison on parole. Prior to that, he had spent the last two decades in and out of the prison system, spending several years behind bars.\n\nNow he's a second-year university student studying political science and conflict resolution, a student mentor and a father who sits on many non-profit boards.\n\nHow did he turn his life around? He credits restorative justice.\n\n\"Restorative justice practices changed my life,\" Beardy told the open caucus forum. \"I didn't want to keep going back to prison and I didn't want to create any more victims. I wanted to change.\"\n\nAfter significant experience in the criminal justice system, Ryan Beardy is now a student mentor, a father, and a second-year university student studying political science and conflict resolution who sits on many non-profit boards. He says restorative justice practices helped change his life. (Jonathan Ventura/CBC)\n\nSo he asked to participate in a therapeutic program, to learn from elders, to connect with his culture. He learned to reject past negative values and belief systems and to begin the journey of healing his mental, physical, emotional and spiritual health.\n\n\"Imagine what society would look like with more empowered, restored individuals, giving back like I am, changing like I did,\" he added.\n\nThe forum also learned that victims can express their suffering directly to offenders (often through videos), feel heard and work through their fears and begin the process of reclaiming their lives.\n\nA positive path forward\n\nSo what needs to happen now to make restorative justice approaches more effective across Canada?\n\nWe need a national framework for implementing restorative justice, in partnership with the provinces.\n\nWe need to support restorative justice programs beyond individual success stories to system-wide approaches, including, as Jennifer Llewellyn stated, \"legislative changes to support increased use and access\" and adequate funding that involves government and community collaboration.\n\nWe also need to educate Canadians about restorative justice options, particularly those stakeholders working in the justice system and community organizations.\n\nAnd it's time, as Johanne Vall\u00e9e, ambassador for the Centre de services de justice r\u00e9paratrice (Centre for Services in Restorative Justice) said, to bring the humanity back to our criminal justice system.\n\nRestorative justice is the positive path forward.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

It was a smart-thinking publisher who helped him find his audience.\n\n\"It's strange and I feel very lucky, especially because I actually wrote these books for adults,\" he said.\n\nKinney set out to write a single book about a year in the life of his character, Greg Heffley, but his publisher came up with the idea of turning the book into a series for kids.\n\n\"I was really trying to write something that was nostalgic, a book, one big fat book that covered one year in the life of a kid, or one school year in the life of a kid, that grown-ups would read and say, 'Oh yeah, that was what it was like to be a kid,' he said.\n\n\"And so I feel very lucky to be in this position, because I was aiming for the wrong target.\"\n\nThe author is coming to Winnipeg next Thursday to promote the release of the 13th book in the series, The Meltdown. The event at the RBC Convention Centre will feature a presentation by Kinney, followed by questions from the audience and a book signing.\n\nThe event in Winnipeg is Kinney's only Canadian stop on his promotional tour. On his past visits to Canada, Kinney says he has mainly stuck to cities like Vancouver and Toronto, but in recent years he's decided to cover new territory.\n\n\"Last year we went to Montreal, this year we're going to Winnipeg, and it will be all new to me and to us, and I can't wait. There seems to be a buzz and there's kind of a growing excitement, which is really exciting for me,\" he said.\n\nThe experience of meeting his fans at events is both overwhelming and exciting, Kinney said.\n\n\"Every so often I'll get a moment at the desk, if I'm signing a book for a kid, I get a sense that for that kid, these books were really important, maybe even life changing. And those are the moments I really try to remember.\"\n\nThose moments have gotten Kinney through some difficult times when writing his books.\n\n\"I'm trying to write these books on deadline, I'll remember that kid and say, 'If I was only writing for that one, that might be worth it.'\"\n\nThe Wimpy Kid series has sold millions of copies around the world and was turned into a movie in 2010. Kinney says he thinks it's the main character's flaws that draw kids \u2014 and parents \u2014 into the books. Children's authors, he says, tend to write heroic characters who always do the right thing.\n\n\"I think that kids, when they read about Greg Heffley, they can see themselves in him, but they see that Greg takes it a step further,\" Kinney said. \"Of course, if I wrote a book about a goody-two-shoes it wouldn't be a very funny book. So I'm always trying to find that balance between making Greg funny but not awful.\"\n\nThe event on Thursday starts at 7 p.m. Tickets are $30 for two people and include a copy of the new book and can be purchased at any McNally Robinson Booksellers location in person, over the phone, or online.", "A high school football team has won its fourth consecutive championship one year after controversy arose over the players' style.\n\nSackville's Tantramar Titans faced the Riverview Royals, one of the teams that filed a complaint against the Titans, for the New Brunswick high school football championship Saturday.

That's easy when it comes to everyday items, such as flour, pasta, nuts and cleaning supplies. She takes reusable jars, usually Mason jars or jars with metal clips, to a bulk store.\n\nEven certain regular grocery stores will let her use her own containers.

If she absolutely cannot find a certain item in bulk, such as chili sauce, Thole will try to buy something in a jar.

On Friday, the throne speech introduced and amended by Brian Gallant and the Liberal Party, their final chance to win over opposition MLAs and perhaps hold on to power, was defeated. With that the lieutenant-governor has asked Blaine Higgs and the Progressive Conservative Party to attempt to form the government.\n\nFor New Brunswick, we have not seen an election that has produced a minority government since 1920. And we have not seen a government fall as a result of a confidence vote since 1883.\n\nThis might be new territory for the province but it actually is quite common not only at the provincial and federal government level in Canada but throughout Westminster-style systems of democracy. In fact, while only two provinces, New Brunswick and British Columbia, will have minority provincial governments at the moment, we often have at least two in Canada every decade.\n\nAdapting to how minority governments operate and are able to maintain the confidence of the legislative assembly is the key to success.\n\nPremier Brian Gallant (left) shakes the hand of Opposition Leader Blaine Higgs (right) after the minority Liberal government was defeated on Friday. (James West/Canadian Press)\n\nThe challenges facing the incoming premier will be about representation and governing, a delicate give and take among four political parties, two of which the Progressive Conservative government may need to rely on to stay in power.\n\nAs a result of the unusual distribution of seats in New Brunswick, Blaine Higgs likely has three major challenges.\n\nCo-operation across the floor\n\nThe first is the challenge presented by the actual outcome of the election. The Progressive Conservative caucus and government likely will have to try to negotiate either formal or informal agreements with at least one of the smaller parties. While the likely partner might be the People's Alliance and their caucus of three members, given their overtures to support the government on confidence votes through 18 months, that poses challenges for Higgs with respect to accommodating the People's Alliance agenda and on which parts of it they are unwilling to compromise.\n\nGreen Party Leader David Coon, left, and People's Alliance Leader Kris Austin, right, look on as Gallant delivered his speech on Friday. The Green Party supported the Liberal minority government, while the People's Alliance teamed up with the Tories to defeat the government. (James West/Canadian Press)\n\nIf, for example, language rights becomes an issue for Higgs, which most francophone and Acadian voters see as non-negotiable where constitutional or policy change is unacceptable, he may have to turn to the other smaller party to stay in power. Further, the optics challenge of backsliding on bilingualism and duality means that the Progressive Conservative Party could wind up owning an issue that was part of another party's platform. And that could become a tremendous liability in the next election campaign.\n\nThe Green Party likely also has policy areas on which they are unwilling to compromise as well, especially concerning issues such as lifting the moratorium on hydraulic fracturing and on language rights.\n\nSo Higgs' first challenge then is to navigate the optics and fine line of having to accommodate these parties. It may mean that no formal agreements or coalitions are possible and the incoming premier may have to govern issue to issue and take his chances on confidence motions. It may also mean that some formal mechanism will present itself and he can govern through at least a budget cycle.\n\nPicking the right platform planks\n\nThe second challenge is what parts of the Progressive Conservative platform he can attempt to pass. Overplaying a government's hand here is not advisable because there are some ideas that might fail to be supported by either of the smaller parties. Each part of the platform has to be revised and, as often the case in minority government situations, many platform planks are just left behind in order to focus on ones that will get the government through the year.\n\nWhile it often makes for interesting policy debate and good political theatre, it is a frustrating position to be in as premier, where typically with a majority you can enact a fairly robust agenda. The key here is to listen to the potential minority government partners and select issues and enact legislation where there is broad consensus.\n\nFormer prime minister Stephen Harper held together a minority government by carefully policies to pass. (Fred Chartrand/Canadian Press)\n\nOne of the reasons Stephen Harper was able to last as prime minister through a long-term minority government situation is that he began with policies that he knew could survive votes because they already had some support with other parties. If Higgs leads with controversial and divisive policies, the government might not last long.\n\nUnchartered territory\n\nFinally, Higgs will be the first premier in modern Canadian provincial political history to have his party lose the popular vote in an election and receive less than 32 per cent of the overall popular vote. That is a challenge from the outset, when over two thirds of voters rejected the Progressive Conservatives in the election.\n\nBut there is an opportunity here for the incoming premier. Given that Higgs is following three consecutive one-term governments, the expectations are extremely low. So if he and the Progressive Conservative caucus somehow thread a series of needles, survive a throne speech and a full budget, carefully select policies that do not alienate, anger and frustrate voters, and convince more of the electorate that they are a competent government, he can take a difficult governing situation and turn it into an eventual electoral success.\n\nBut Premier-designate Higgs must know that a minority government as precarious as his has historically not lasted very long.\n\nHiggs' strengths\n\nCreating the conditions for success following such a close election will require compromise, deftness to egos and other political agendas, and balancing his policies with the other more junior partners. Perhaps as a result of his career in the private sector and a history as a negotiator, he has the requisite skills to navigate these challenges.\n\nOne of the great strengths Higgs has is that he becomes premier with a fair amount of respect among his colleagues in the legislature on all sides and a reputation as a straight shooter who cares about dignity and character in political discourse. Do not underestimate the need for respectful political discourse in uncertain times. Further, a little transparency likely will go a long way in an executive political environment that has too often been perceived as secretive, unresponsive to the public and to journalists, and reliant on message track style communications without honest dialogue, a trend not just in New Brunswick but everywhere in Canada.\n\nProgressive Conservative Leader Blaine Higgs signals to the gallery prior to the closure of the throne speech debate. (James West/Canadian Press)\n\nAnother strength is that Higgs ran against populist and anti-bilingual impulses in this election. He and the Progressive Conservatives largely distanced themselves from divisive language rights rhetoric. Higgs may have an opportunity to use that as strength and temper populism's ugly tendencies.\n\nIn an era where populist and nationalist extremism are on the rise, often the best voices to stand up against this intolerance are establishment politicians who can call out policies and rhetoric that are too off-centre or discourse that is disrespectful. Govern effectively, take into account the concerns that the public has about political agendas that are too extreme, and Higgs can be a well-respected and successful premier.\n\nGiven the political uncertainty New Brunswick is mired in, it is contingent on us as citizens of the province to hope that Higgs can succeed.", "An Australian nun who angered the Philippine president by joining anti-government protests has called on Filipinos to unite and fight human rights abuses ahead of her forced departure from the country.\n\nSister Patricia Anne Fox is set to leave the Philippines on Saturday for Australia after the Bureau of Immigration ordered her deported months ago and downgraded her missionary visa to a temporary visitor's visa, which expires Saturday.\n\nDuring a farewell news conference Saturday, the 71-year-old Fox called on Filipinos to speak up and help the marginalized fight to gain land, houses and jobs.\n\nShe told The Associated Press that Rodrigo Duterte's deadly anti-drug crackdown was \"horribly barbaric\" and vowed to return if allowed to resume her 27 years of missionary work for the poor.", "Voters in several parts of Myanmar went to the polls Saturday in 13 byelections seen as a test of support for leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her ruling party.\n\nSuu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in the 2015 general election, putting an end to decades of rule by the military and its proxies, though the army retains considerable power under a constitution it implemented.\n\nSuu Kyi's appeal with the country's Buddhist majority has not suffered much from a crisis involving 700,000 members of the Muslim Rohingya minority who fled a brutal army counterinsurgency campaign in the country's west.

That possible political realignment could come at the ruling NLD's disadvantage. Areas involved include Chin, Shan and Rakhine states.\n\nLow voter turnout may be the main hallmark of Saturday's polls, though more so in Yangon than in ethnic minority regions.\n\nIn Yangon's Tamwe township, more than 70,000 voters cast ballots in 2015's general election, according to Toe Win, the NLD's candidate for the constituency. He estimated Saturday's turnout will reach around 20,000.\n\nToe Win is running to fill the seat of President Win Myint, who by law had to step down from his legislative post when he was appointed the country's chief executive earlier this year.\n\nBusinessman Maung Maung said he had to queue with hundreds of voters to vote in 2015. \"This morning I saw about 20 voters.

It's not a wetland, it's not a forest,\" said Dave Morrow, a horticulturalist in Grand Falls-Windsor.\n\n\"It's just an ornamental plant property on our land. So you have to look at that, and what its needs are.\"\n\nA thick layer of leaves atop your lawn can provide habitat to lots of insects, some beneficial and some not so much. (Lindsay Bird/CBC)\n\nMorrow agreed that leaves left in yards provide shelter for a variety of life forms. But unfortunately, he said, many of those organisms, from chinch bugs to bacterial diseases, are unwanted for a lawn environment.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Morrow is a fan of a pristine swath of Kentucky bluegrass either. He pointed to the virtues of having a lawn where grasses and weeds mix, which he said provides a diversity of habitat for subsoil insects and pollinators alike.\n\n\"Just allow the weeds to grow. You can still mow it, it's still green, it looks attractive,\" he said.\n\n\"Rather than not raking leaves in the fall of the year, I think you should look more at trying to create a better environment for the insects and the other creatures that might live in the soil and feed off the flowers.\"\n\nThe myth of mulch?\n\nA common gardening tip to deal with leaves without resorting to rakes is to use a lawnmower to mulch the leaves, and then leave that refuse atop lawns or scatter it in garden beds.\n\nBut Morrow cautioned against that too.\n\n\"It may or may not work. It takes time for this stuff to break down,\" he said.\n\n\"By leaving uncomposted foliage on top of your lawn, you're still stifling the lawn.\"\n\nAt least it has people thinking about it, and thinking about nature. - Andrew Holland\n\nHe advised using a bag attachment while mowing leaves, and then dumping those leaves into a compost pile and letting it overwinter \u2014 and then, in spring, using that composted product as a soil top dressing.\n\nBoth Morrow and Holland agreed it's ultimately up to the individual homeowners, and the specific conditions of their yards, as to whether to partake in an autumn clean up or not. While Holland's anti-raking arguments may fly in the face of horticulture, but he said the debate still serves a purpose no matter which call you make.\n\n\"At least it has people thinking about it, and thinking about nature,\" he said.\n\nWith files from The St. John's Morning Show\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "When chemical engineer Sophia He was recruited to Dalhousie University's agriculture school five years ago, she began to brainstorm with local farmers about how leftover organic material could be turned into useful products.\n\nOne day, she got a call from one of them wondering about used coffee grounds. So she dispatched a student to a local Tim Hortons in Bible Hill, N.S., where inquisitive staff sorted through their compost waste and handed some over.\n\nSo began a research effort aimed at taking the waste product of a must-have staple for many Canadians and turning it into a fuel that could help power their cars.\n\n\"We think this is a very important waste stream, but it's under-evaluated and it's underutilized,\" He said in an interview in her lab.\n\nThe associate professor is part of a larger push in Canada, and elsewhere in the world, to create more environmentally friendly fuels from \"biomass waste\" \u2014 everything from kitchen scraps to sawdust.\n\nEthanol, a biofuel largely made from corn and wheat, now accounts for about six per cent of gasoline content in Canada. But as demand for alternatives to fossil fuels rises, there's an attempt to add more novel sources to the biofuel mix.\n\n\"There's going to be a limit at some point to how much you can pull out of agriculture,\" according to Ian Thompson, president of the industry advocacy group Advanced Biofuels Canada.\n\nIn November 2017, a British company said it had produced 6,000 litres of coffee oil to help power London buses. (Akira Suemori/Associated Press)\n\nIt's not outrageous to think that coffee grounds can help power vehicles. For instance, the British firm bio-bean, in concert with oil giant Shell, last year started providing such fuel to London's transportation system, albeit only enough to power the equivalent of a single bus for a year.\n\nIn the world of biomass waste, coffee grounds have a leg up, according to He. For one, they are already a \"beautiful particle size\" that unlike other feedstocks don't need to be ground down, she said. They also contain about 15 per cent oil, which can be easily extracted.\n\nWhat to do with what remains is more tricky, He said. She uses a hydrothermal liquefaction reactor in her lab, essentially a pressure cooker that turns the residue into a crude oil, one that still needs more refining before it can be used.\n\n\"It's really doable. The only barrier is cost,\" she said.\n\nTim Hortons says it serves more than two billion cups of coffee a year. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press)\n\nBringing the costs of producing fuel from biomass waste down to a level near fossil fuels is one of the challenges. Another issue is trying to \"scale-up\" \u2014 the process of going from the test-tube level in the laboratory to a rugged industrial technology.\n\nThe chemistry and thermodynamics involving high volumes are different than with small amounts, Thompson said.

So with the time change, you're potentially putting it back a whole hour's time.

(Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)\n\nSome farmers will make small adjustments to milking times over a few days to ease the transition or go \"cold turkey\" and make no change, said Cameron.\n\nHe said that experienced farmers have systems in place to adjust to the time changes, so it's not a major concern for them.\n\nFarmers are \"locked and loaded into a very regimented routine with their herds, the chores, milking the cows,\" said Cameron.", "There's a famous scene in the movie Casablanca, when Rick, Humphrey Bogart's grizzled club owner, is told that he is being shut down.

(CBC)\n\nJoyce didn't put his request in writing; she had to call him for him to tell her what to do. Gambin-Walsh, who was responsible for Service NL, was not interested in what he had to say, but he pressed on \u2014 with playbook directions of how government jobs can be handed out.\n\nHere's the relevant excerpt from the report:\n\nI told Minister Joyce that the applicant was not qualified for the position. Minister Joyce was not happy about this and he was very persistent by saying go back and tell him that's who you want, yes you can do that, you're the Minister.\n\nGambin-Walsh did indeed talk to her deputy minister, who reported back that Joyce's friend met only two of the six requirements for the job.\n\nTo say that relations between the two got worse would be an understatement.\n\nA quick history lesson\n\nIt might be useful to look at some context here.\n\nEddie Joyce was first elected in 1989, the year that Clyde Wells led the Liberals out of Opposition and into power. As a famous footnote, Wells lost his own race in Humber East against Tory minister Lynn Verge \u2026 leading Joyce to resign his Bay of Islands seat just a day into MHAhood, so that Wells could take his place in the legislature.\n\nIt was a sacrifice that the Liberals never forgot.\n\nThere's another narrative from that time that's worth remembering. In May 1991, Liberal heavyweight John Efford was forced out of cabinet \u2014 over his role in a scandal over political hiring. [I reported on this at the time for the long-defunct Sunday Express.]\n\nA volunteer who had worked on Efford's campaigns had been leaked questions, in advance, for a job interview managed through the Public Service Commission. The worker revealed that fact to another member of a workers' compensation review panel, who in turn took the information to Efford, then the minister of social services.\n\nJohn Efford was forced out of cabinet in 1991 over how he handled a complaint about leaked job interview questions. (CBC)\n\nTo that official's surprise, Efford didn't take the matter seriously.\n\nEfford didn't have anything to do with leaking the questions \u2014 the finger of blame fell to his executive assistant, Roland Butler, and to Beaton Tulk, who had been hired as an assistant deputy minister in Efford's department in the aftermath of losing his own seat in the 1989 election. [Tulk was within his rights to ask for the questions; it was just found to be extraordinarily unusual.]\n\nWhat burned Clyde Wells was that Efford did not respond appropriately to a complaint.\n\nEfford remained pretty unapologetic about the whole matter. Off the record, some politicians told me that the main thing that went wrong was that it all came to light.\n\n[By the way, none of the repercussions for the people involved were permanent. Efford came back to cabinet in 1993. Roland Butler later succeeded him as MHA. Beaton Tulk became Brian Tobin's anointed choice to serve as premier after he quit, and before the Liberals clashed at a leadership convention in which Roger Grimes bested Efford. Politics, man.]\n\nSo, that was the political culture of that era. Nothing, of course, compared to earlier times, when a premier like Joseph R. Smallwood could hire and fire at will.\n\nEddie Joyce came up through the same system as John Efford and others.\n\nSherry Gambin-Walsh, it has to be underscored, did not.\n\nIn the meantime, we can only wonder how many other weekend conversations between cabinet ministers have taken place, and how many times politicians have told their deputy ministers \"that's who I want.\"\n\nEddie Joyce, at the moment, isn't going anywhere \u2014 in several senses of the phrase. He's not apologizing, and he's also still sitting as an Independent, away from the Liberal caucus.\n\nSherry Gambin-Walsh is going somewhere, sort of.

Even if the product doesn't list explicit health claims, the implicit meaning in its name can be enough to require a natural health product classification.\n\nTeatox kits typically include a morning and an evening tea blend, and consumers are instructed to drink a cup of each every day for seven, 14, 28 or 30 days. (Dave MacIntosh/CBC)\n\nMarketplace ordered 10 of the most popular teatox kits online and had them shipped to a Canadian address. Three of the brands are Canadian, and the rest are based outside the country.\n\nNone of the teatox kits had a natural health product number and none are licensed to be sold in Canada.\n\nAfter Marketplace reached out to Health Canada with questions about the kits we were able to purchase, the regulator says it is in the process of reviewing these products. Should it confirm any non-compliance, Health Canada says it \"will take action.\"\n\nTeatoxing unnecessary and ineffective: health professionals\n\nIn addition to appearing to violate Health Canada's rules, the effectiveness of \"detoxifying\" teas is in question. Nutritionists, dietitians and doctors have repeatedly warned that the need to help your body detoxify is a myth.\n\nThat makes detox strategies \u2014 and products like teatoxes \u2014 unnecessary.\n\n\"Detoxing is one in a long line of theories that are created to produce fear and feelings of inadequacy in order to drive people's behaviour, often toward purchasing a product,\" said Dr. Eric Cadesky, a family physician in Vancouver and president of Doctors of BC.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of social media buzz about teatoxes, but doctors and dietitians say that the need to help your body detoxify is a myth.

If you are interested in helping your body along, Cadesky recommends spending your money on fresh, colourful foods and staying hydrated.\n\nRhiannon Lambert, a U.K.-based nutritionist specializing in eating disorders and obesity, also disputes the claims that teatoxing can flatten your stomach and assist in weight loss.\n\n\"Weight loss from laxatives may also [come] down to dehydration, not fat loss,\" said Lambert. \"Realistically, the only thing that will be lost when purchasing these products is money.\"\n\nNatural laxatives in many evening teas\n\nTeatox kits typically include a morning and an evening tea blend, and consumers are instructed to drink a cup of each every day for seven, 14, 28 or 30 days.\n\nIngredients you'd find on grocery store shelves, like peppermint, ginger and lemongrass are often in the morning teas, but many also include a natural diuretic of some kind, like dandelion, and have energy-boosting ingredients like green tea and caffeine. Evening teas can also include a diuretic, but most commonly they have leaves or roots that are natural laxatives.\n\nSenna leaf, also known as cassia seed, is the most common ingredient found in the evening teas purchased by Marketplace. Its use concerns both health regulators and dietitians.\n\nSome medical groups warn that detox teas containing senna may have a laxative effect, which can lead to vomiting and diarrhea \u2014 and impact the body's ability to absorb medications, including birth control. (CBC)\n\nHealth Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration both warn against taking senna for longer than seven days.\n\nThe reason is that your body can develop a dependency on senna, said registered dietitian Christy Brissette. \"There's potential that your body won't be able to have a bowel movement without it, which is pretty scary,\" she said.\n\nSenna stimulates your intestines and causes contractions. In addition to sending you running to the bathroom, Brissette warns senna can cause diarrhea and stomach cramps, though reactions vary depending on the person.\n\n\"It's actually really not a pleasant experience. You feel like you're seizing up. And it causes you to have really loose stools,\" Brissette said.\n\nSome of the teatox brands mention senna's side effects on their websites or packaging, but few warn about the risks associated with long-term use.\n\nHealth Canada's rules regarding the use of senna are explicitly clear, says Durette.\n\n\"Every product containing senna sold in or imported to Canada must have an NHPN [natural health product number] or a DIN [drug information number].\"\n\nIf a tea is not registered as a natural health product, Health Canada considers it a food product \u2014 and senna is not an approved ingredient for any food in Canada.\n\nThere are teas containing senna sold in Canada that are licensed as natural health products. But nine of the 10 teatox kits ordered byMarketplace contained senna or cassia seed, and none were registered with Health Canada.\n\nConcern over contraception\n\nThe U.K.'s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has warned that detox teas containing senna may have a laxative effect, which can lead to vomiting and diarrhea. That can impact the body's ability to absorb medications, it says, including birth control pills.\n\nWomen who are taking laxatives and experience these symptoms should \"use additional contraception while ill and for two days after recovering,\" according to the college.\n\nEven if people don't experience vomiting or diarrhea, the U.S. National Library of Medicine says senna can decrease the effectiveness of some birth controls that include a form of estrogen called ethinyl estradiol.\n\nSix of the nine tea products containing senna or cassia that Marketplace ordered had warnings on their websites that the effectiveness of contraception could be impacted.\n\nTeatox companies asked for response\n\nOf the three Canadian products Marketplace purchased, two had senna listed as an ingredient: Tease and Skinny Teatox. Neither responded to Marketplace's repeated requests for information.\n\nThe third Canadian product, Victoria-based Purgo Tea, does not list senna on its package, but it does list cassia seed. In emails to Marketplace, the company said it promotes \"positive daily habits and [a] healthy lifestyle.\"\n\nThe company also said their teas are \"intended to help [complement] your health and wellness goals.\"\n\nTiny Tea (by Your Tea) responded to Marketplace's email asking about the presence of senna in its product, stating, \"the use of senna in our Tiny Tea is minuscule and therefore does not cause a laxative effect whatsoever. It is countered with another herb (barley) so that the presence of senna actually doesn't perform its usual role as it if were on its own.\"\n\nBooTea, Flat Tummy Tea Co., SkinnyMint, Teami and Detox Skinny Herb Tea all list senna as an ingredient in their evening tea, but none responded to requests for comment.\n\nFitTea was the only brand that doesn't contain senna or cassia seed. It lists sencha green tea, rooibos and garcinia cambogia as its lead ingredients. The company also didn't respond to Marketplace's emails.\n\nPolicing web-based products challenging\n\nMost teatox kits are sold exclusively online and are promoted on social media platforms, primarily Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBut Cadesky warns that effective marketing does not mean effective products. \"That's why it's so important that people listen to their bodies and talk with their doctors,\" he said.\n\nHealth Canada said it has been seeing an influx of complaints over web-based products and that policing them is a challenge.\n\n\"People will buy a lot of stuff on the web,\" said Durette. \"And we keep on saying be careful, it might not be approved in Canada.\"", "As Ottawa's new city council prepares to vote on whether or not to allow cannabis retailers next month, one councillor has another strategy: opt out of voting altogether.\n\nRideau-Vanier Coun.

(A snapshot of this country's health.)\n\nWhile the report touches on the deadly opioid crisis and health concerns linked to legal recreational marijuana, Tam said alcohol abuse also deserves the nation's attention.\n\n\"We have lost sight of the fact that continued high rates of problematic alcohol consumption are leading to a wide range of harms,\" she writes.\n\nA deeper dive into the numbers shows a troubling trend for Canadian women: they're dying from alcohol abuse at a faster rate than men.\n\nTam's report points out that between 2011 to 2017, the alcohol-attributed death rate for women increased by 26 per cent, compared with a roughly five per cent increase over the same period for men.\n\nGirls aged 10 to 19 have higher hospitalization rates for alcohol abuse than boys the same age.\n\n\"Men still have higher rates of alcohol consumption ... but women are catching up and this is really a worrying sign. There's an increase in the rate of heavy drinking among women,\" Tam said in an interview for CBC's The House.\n\nTam said researchers are still trying to figure out why the numbers are rising \u2014 but part of the reason could be that women are using alcohol to cope with stress and anxiety.\n\n\"We need to understand the reasons why women are consuming alcohol in a way that leads to harm. So women do have different experiences with trauma, sexual abuse, bullying \u2014 those underlying factors are important when you're looking at prevention,\" she said.\n\nSelling booze as equality\n\nWhile Canada might be losing sight of its drinking problem, it's hard to ignore alcohol's presence in Western culture.\n\nFrom the \"purple-toothed\" characters on Courteney Cox's Cougartown to wine-guzzling heroines on shows like The Good Wife and Scandal, pop culture presents alcohol as a normal way for women to unwind at the end of a work day.\n\nBeyond traditional TV and magazine advertising, a quick scroll through Facebook and Instagram turns up ads selling wine as \"Mommy juice.\"\n\nThe link between alcohol consumption and a desire to reduce stress could be part of the problem, says Tam.\n\n\"I think, overall, more needs to be done to de-normalize alcohol in Canada. So 80 per cent of Canadians consume alcohol. Rising rates in women tells us that we ignore alcohol,\" she said.\n\nCatherine Paradis, a senior researcher and policy analyst with the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, said there's been a steady trend of alcohol makers and marketers targeting women since the 1990s.\n\nWhile she said there's nothing necessarily wrong with advertisers tailoring their messaging, Paradis has a problem with ads borrowing the messaging of the women's liberation movement to sell booze.\n\n\"What I find extremely disturbing is advertising has been using the pretext of sexual equality to encourage women to drink like men,\" she said.\n\n\"Would it ever cross your mind to ingest the same amount of calories as your father, your brother, your spouse? Of course not. But the alcohol industry has somehow managed to make us believe that, when it comes to alcohol, that should be sort of a measure of gender equality.\"\n\nThe problem with trying to keep up with men at the bar, said Tam, is that women and men metabolize alcohol differently.\n\n\"Our water content is different. The body enzymes that metabolize alcohol are different in women,\" she said.\n\nChanges coming from Ottawa\n\nThe federal government was forced to wade into the binge drinking conversation earlier this year after a 14-year-old girl died after she reportedly consumed an 11.9 per cent alcohol malt liquor drink called FCKD UP on her school lunch break.\n\n\"As you know, following the tragedy in Quebec, we took action to begin work on restricting the amount of alcohol in highly sweetened alcoholic beverages,\" said a spokesperson for Health Minister Ginette Petitpas-Taylor.\n\n\"We are still reviewing recommendations of the Health Committee and working on regulations we will be introducing in the near future.\u200b\"\n\nParadis said it's a good first step but more should be done to curb marketing.\n\nDr. Theresa Tam said Canada has lost sight of its problematic alcohol consumption.

It's been trivialized way too much in past years.\"\n\nShifting consumption patterns will take political commitment, but Canada already accomplished something similar with tobacco use, said Tam.\n\n\"We managed to reduce consumption of tobacco through a suite of policies, educational measures and regulations,\" she said.\n\n\"That takes a considerable effort.\"\n\nCBC News reached out to alcohol industry associations for comment but has not received a response.", "Twice a year, most Canadians change the time of their clocks by an hour.\n\nWe \"fall back,\" as we'll do this Sunday, Nov. 4, at 2 a.m. And a few months later, on March 10, 2019, we'll \"spring forward.\"\n\nWe know that the time shift helps us make the most of light in the morning and evening, and that it can temporarily upset our sleep schedules.\n\nBut why do we do it?\n\nThe idea was first proposed by Benjamin Franklin in the 1770s, but wasn't implemented until around 1915. Germany was the first country to use it, then Britain. It was adopted more widely during the First World War, which is when Canada started using daylight time.\n\nReducing energy consumption and making the best use of daylight hours were the main reasons daylight time was used.\n\nThere have been changes to the dates when clocks would change over the years, most recently in 2007, when legislation in the United States moved the start of daylight time three weeks earlier in the spring and the return to standard time a week later in the fall.\n\nThe change was aimed at trying to help save energy. Canada followed the move in the U.S. so the time zones would remain aligned. That means clocks now:\n\nFall back the first Sunday in November.\n\nSpring forward the second Sunday in March.\n\nOnly in some parts of Canada\n\nMost of Saskatchewan has not observed daylight time since 1966, staying on central standard time all year round. Some border towns follow the time schemes of their neighbours in Manitoba or Alberta.\n\nAreas of Quebec east of 63 degrees west longitude do not change to daylight time and remain on Atlantic time year round. Pockets of Ontario and British Columbia do not use daylight time.\n\nDaylight time is observed in most of the United States. Just two states \u2014 Arizona and Hawaii \u2014 and three territories \u2014 American Samoa, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands \u2014 do not participate.\n\nPeople walk along the road in cold fog at night in Athboy, Ireland, October 31, 2018. A study by U.S. researchers found there were more pedestrian deaths during the evening rush hour in November than October as drivers and pedestrians adjusted to the earlier darkness. (Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters)\n\nThere have been debates about whether daylight time remains useful. A March 2013 telephone survey of 1,000 adults by Rasmussen Reports in the U.S., for example, suggested 45 per cent of people thought it had no value, and 19 per cent were unsure.\n\nA similar survey of Europeans in the summer of 2018 found 84 per cent want to stop changing their clocks twice a year. That prompted the European Commission to announce in August that it would recommend that European Union member states abolish daylight savings.\n\nThe time change can also affect sleep cycles. \"Falling back,\" is generally thought to be less physically stressful, because people can get an extra hour of sleep, but studies show that's not always the case.\n\nTime changes are not always beneficial to traffic and pedestrians. A study by U.S. researchers found there were more pedestrian deaths during the evening rush hour in November than October as drivers and pedestrians adjusted to the earlier darkness.\n\nUpcoming time changes (ET)", "After two record-breaking wildfire seasons, the B.C. government released a new plan this week to improve emergency management.\n\nA large focus of the action plan is working with First Nation communities, said Doug Donaldson, B.C.'s Minister of Forests.

Since they lack access to the legal supply chain controlled by the province, they're selling black-market cannabis.\n\n\"Black market sounds very nefarious and Tony Soprano-ish, but black market is also people growing plants in their backyards illegally,\" said mayor-elect Kennedy Stewart in an interview.\n\n\"I don't want to go busting heads in local neighbourhoods.

When the city and police decided not to crack down unless there were public safety concerns, such as sales to youth or suspected gang ties, the number of pot shops exploded to more than 100.\n\nCity council brought in a licensing regime in 2015 that aimed to cut down the number of shops. The business licences ranged from $10,000 to $30,000 and required stores to be located 300 metres from schools, community centres or each other.\n\nOnly 19 have received licences to date, while dozens more have decided to remain open. The city has filed a court challenge against those refusing to shut their doors and a decision has yet to be rendered.\n\nEven those that have licences from the city were still breaking federal law, since storefront sales of cannabis remained illegal in Canada until Oct. 17.\n\nAnd now with legalization, all Vancouver stores are still illegal, since none have been licensed by the province and city under the new regime.\n\nFour steps to receiving provincial licence\n\nThere are four steps to the new regime: stores apply to the province; the province reviews the application and refers it to the municipality; the municipality reviews it and issues a recommendation to the province; and then the province issues a licence.\n\nIn Vancouver and some other cities, there's also a fifth step: the city must issue its own business licence.\n\nAs of mid-October, Vancouver had received seven applications for review from the province.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Mike Farnworth has defended British Columbia's pace on licensing stores. B.C. has one public and one private store, while Alberta, New Brunswick and Newfoundland have close to 20 stores each.\n\n\"We've taken an approach that was very much collaborating with local governments and we believe that was the right approach to take,\" Farnworth said on Oct. 19.\n\nStewart, a former New Democrat MP, noted that Farnworth has also advised illicit stores to shut their doors if they want to be approved for a provincial licence.\n\nThe mayor-elect said there needs to be an adaptation period for the stores that aren't \"chronic, long-term offenders.\"\n\n\"It is a brand new thing that cannabis is legal in the country.

Dave Sweet was called to investigate the case of Mark Mariani, who was found stomped to death in an alleyway near North Hill Centre about eight years ago. Eventually two neo-Nazis were sentenced to life in prison for the random slaying.\n\nSweet shared that story and his inspiration for co-writing Skeletons in my Closet: Life Lessons from a Homicide Detective with CBC Calgary News at Six.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length. You can watch the complete interview here.\n\nDet. Dave Sweet on his true crime book 7:25\n\nQ: You say that's a case you will never forget. Why is that?\n\nA: It was October 3, 2010. I got phoned at 9 a.m. that morning.\n\nI had only been in the homicide unit at that time for about a year. It was a new investigation but would become very complex in nature.\n\nThat's why I will always remember that case. I was appalled and shocked at the brutality of the crime. I had a feeling it was going to be difficult to solve.\n\nQ: You had already been on the force for about 10 years so you must have seen some things already, and you were still shocked?\n\nA: I had but not to the same extent or same exposure you get while you are a member with our homicide unit.\n\nThat was something that was shocking to me. Up until that point, I don't know that I had seen such a brutal crime.\n\nQ: What's it like to see the telling of that story in a true-crime television segment?\n\nA: It's very interesting. It's been a fantastic opportunity to be part of it. I think it showcases well the efforts put into trying to solve these types of cases.\n\nQ: There can be a disconnect between what people see on TV and how crime solving actually happens in real life. Is it nice to be able to show people how it actually works?\n\nA: I think the show does a good job in the spirit of trying to pull together what an investigation looks like.\n\nThe show's focus is on the actions of one detective but there is a whole team of people that are working alongside that person through the course of an investigation.\n\nQ: What was it like seeing an actor playing you?\n\nA: It was interesting to see who they chose. I thought he did a fantastic job. He was certainly more handsome.\n\nQ: You describe the book as true crime meets Chicken Soup for the Soul. What does that mean?\n\nA: The book profiles some of my experiences with the Calgary Police Service over the last 20 years, but I have tried to find the silver linings in the sometimes awful things we investigate, and that's the chicken soup part of it.\n\nThe book is not intended to be a tell-all of the gruesomeness or horrific acts people commit against each other but more to set the tone for lessons I can share with the community.\n\nQ: So it's based on real life, not on fiction?\n\nA: I changed some details in the book to protect certain cases or people, but for the most part the book is absolutely true.\n\nQ: Why did you write it?\n\nA: It started as a project to myself and it evolved into a bigger-scale project.\n\nI wanted to write it for my children, to share with them things I had learned in my career and give them some lessons and take-homes they could use in their own lives.\n\nIt was written as \"lessons from dad.\"\n\nWith files from CBC Calgary News at Six.", "British Columbians who don't identify as either male or female now have the choice to display an X in the gender field of their B.C. driver's licence, identity card, birth certificate and BC Services Card.\n\n\"Since last summer, we have been working on changes to government documents in recognition and respect of people who do not identify as male or female,\" said health minister Adrian Dix, in a media release.\n\n\"Including the X gender designation on key ID is an important step in this,\" he said.\n\nThe ministries of Health, Citizens' Services and Attorney General worked together to get the X designation option.\n\n\"We are taking action to move British Columbia into the 21st century when it comes to gender identity,\" said Jinny Sims, minister of Citizens' Services. \"It is the right thing to do.\"\n\nKori Doty identifies as neither male nor female, and wants their child to be able to do the same.
