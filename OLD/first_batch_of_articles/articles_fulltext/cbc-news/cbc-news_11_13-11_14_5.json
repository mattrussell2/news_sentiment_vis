["The runway lights were on and it was snowing when the plane carrying a husband and wife from Brampton rapidly dropped from the sky and crashed into the grass near a runway at the Brantford Municipal Airport.\n\nIt was around 1:19 a.m. Tuesday when the Piper Arrow hit the turf and skidded to the stop, according to Transportation Safety Board (TSB) spokesperson Chris Krepski.\n\n\"The aircraft was in a left bank with a high descent rate at the time of impact,\" he explained.\n\nAfter two days examining the damaged plane, investigators know that much, but are still working to determine what caused the crash that killed Ronald Chamberlain, 76 and his wife Mildred, 81.\n\nOne of the pieces of possible evidence they're examining is a series of more than 20 clicking sequences that could indicate the couple circled the air field for almost 40 minutes, trying to remotely turn on the runway lights before crashing in the dark and snow.\n\nTSB investigating air traffic control audio\n\nThe clicking can be heard among the static on archived air traffic control audio for the airport on the night of the crash starting around 12:40 a.m. and ending at 1:14 a.m. \u2014 about five minutes before officials say the plane came down.\n\nThat timeframe seems to correspond with the account of a nearby resident who told CBC News he heard a low-flying aircraft \"circling and circling\" the airport between 1 a.m. and 1:30 a.m. that night.\n\nBased on the information we have been able to gather, the lights were on at the time of the crash. - Chris Krepski , TSB\n\nThe repetitive series of four or five quick clicks are similar to the sounds a pilot would generate using the cockpit radio to remotely turn on the runway lights at a smaller, local airport.\n\nA spokesperson for the City of Brantford said the airport is staffed from dawn until dusk. Outside of those hours, pilots have the ability to control lights on airport's longest runway so they can safely land in the dark.\n\nBy pressing the push to talk switch on their radio a specific number of times [generally 3,5 or 7] within a certain time period, pilots can activate the lights and control their intensity, according to Krepski.\n\nHe added the TSB is aware of the audio recordings and will be \"taking a closer look,\" although at this point officials don't know who was doing the clicking.\n\n\"It's too early to say what they mean, whether or not it was the aircraft in question that activated or another aircraft or ground station that activated them or there were multiple attempts to activate due to a malfunction in the system.\"\n\nThe longest runway at the Brantford airport has lights that can be remotely activated by a pilot at night, according to the TSB. (Google Maps)\n\nHe added, \"based on the information we have been able to gather, the lights were on at the time of the crash.\"\n\nThe TSB has quarantined the aircraft and plan to bring it to a facility in Richmond Hill for further examination.\n\n\"We're still getting information together about pilot training and aircraft maintenance, more information about weather \u2026and radar,\" said Krepski.\n\nA 'diligent pilot' who loved his plane\n\nThe crash has shaken the local flying community, especially at the Burlington airport, where Ronald Chamberlain kept his plane.\n\nTim Crawford, a pilot manages business for the airport, said he was \"cross-taxiway neighbours\" with Chamberlain and knew him since 1995.\n\n\"He loved flying and he was an accomplished pilot,\" he said. \"Everyone in the airport community is just shaking their heads, trying to figure out what could have possibly happened to make things end up so tragically.\"\n\nCrawford describes Chamberlain as a \"diligent pilot\" who loved flying so much he'd often take his wife up just for fun.\n\nRonald Chamberlain is shown with his Piper Arrow during a COPA For Kids event in 2015. (copaflight26.com)\n\nThe veteran pilot also made a name for himself at the airport as an active member of the Canadian Owners and Pilots Association (COPA) For Kids program. Chamberlain said they'd volunteer their time and take dozens of kids on flights.\n\n\"Everybody is struggling to deal with the loss.\"\n\nDown on the tarmac, other pilots would sometimes gently tease Chamberlain by pronouncing his plane's call sign \u2014 C-GDUM \u2014 as Charlie, Golf, Dumb. But that plane was his pride and joy.\n\n\"It was immaculate,\" said Crawford. \"It was a fabulous airplane. That was his baby.\"\n\nBrantford a popular stop\n\nNow Crawford is struggling to understand how such an experienced pilot could crash at a familiar airport.\n\nBrantford is home to a restaurant that makes it a popular place for area pilots to stop in for a bowl of soup or a burger, he explained. Chamberlain would probably have flown there \"a thousand times.\"\n\nCrawford has flown there himself on countless occasion and said he's even used the remote lights at night.\n\nTuesday night was cloudy, snowy and moonless. Crawford said he can't understand why Chamerblain would try to land there.\n\n\"No pilot would ever try to make an approach into an unlit airport. It's just not something people do,\" he said. \"Hamilton airport is literally 15 or 17 nautical miles away from Brantford. None of it makes any sense to me as a pilot.\"", "A community on Vancouver Island is set to be the first ice rink in B.C. to make the switch from using ammonia to a carbon dioxide system.\n\nAfter three workers died in a Fernie, B.C., ice rink due to an ammonia leak last year, Campbell River's Strathcona Regional District says it started searching for a safer solution.\n\nThe Strathcona Gardens Recreation Complex has two rinks which will both be converted to utilize the CO2 refrigeration technology, according to Gavin Hamblin, the manager of arenas and facility operations.\n\nThe district was given a provincial grant of $4.6 million for an energy recovery project at the facility.\n\n\"We're able to look at options to do a holistic approach \u2026 and CO2 is something that will enable us to do that, capture as much energy as possible from both the ice plants and use it in other areas of the facility,\" Hamblin told On The Island's Gregor Craigie.\n\nHe said this system will be much safer because while ammonia gas is poisonous and fast acting, CO2 is classified as an asphyxiant and is only harmful in high concentrations.\n\nRinks in Ontario and Quebec currently use CO2 and Hamblin said Alberta and the Yukon are in the process of converting some of their facilities.\n\nThe system is being designed and engineered, and he expects the pre-fabricated parts to arrive for installation by the annual spring-summer rink closure.\n\nWith files from On The Island\n\nTo hear the full interview listen to media below:\n\nAfter three workers died in a Fernie, B.C. ice rink due to an ammonia leak last year, Campbell River's Strathcona Regional District started thinking about a safer solution. 6:40\n\nRead more from CBC British Columbia", "Musician Ken Tizzard is clear about how important legendary singer/songwriter Ron Hynes is to him.\n\n\"I just think it's part of what I need to do on this planet right now, is play his songs,\" said Tizzard.\n\nTizzard's new album, A Good Dog is Lost: A Collection of Ron Hynes Songs, features many of Hynes's well-known tunes, such as Sonny's Dream and St. John's Waltz, but also lesser-known fare such as Boy From Old Perlican and 1962.\n\nLongtime fan\n\nTizzard, who is best known through his work with Canadian rock band the Watchmen and through his own work as an Ontario-based singer/songwriter, grew up in St. John's.\n\nHe first discovered Ron Hynes through the Wonderful Grand Band's CBC Television series in the 1980s.\n\nMusician Ron Hynes, originally from Ferryland, died in 2015.

Parent refused and served out his term.\n\nAn investigation by the ombudsman's office, released last week, uncovered a $165 million accounting error at Veterans Affairs stretching back to the early 2000s. The mistake involved the indexing calculation of disability awards and benefits.\n\nIt was Parent's last report.\n\nThe Liberal government intends to reimburse veterans for the missing funds, beginning in 2020.\n\nThe use of the title 'ombudsperson' is an attempt by the federal government to embrace gender-neutral language. The government issued a directive earlier this year to front-line staff at Service Canada, who answer questions from the public about services such as social insurance and Old Age Security, to begin conversations by using gender-inclusive language.\n\nThat caused an uproar in the House of Commons, where the Conservative Opposition described the department's policy as \"ridiculous.\"\n\nOmbudsman is Swedish for \"legal representative.\" There has been debate in recent years over whether it needs a gender-neutral form, and what form it might take.\n\nSome jurisdictions, including some provinces and universities, have embraced the term 'ombudsperson' or simply 'ombud'.\n\nEarlier this year, Global Affairs adopted the term when it created the office of Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, tasked with investigating allegations of human rights abuses linked to Canadian corporate activity abroad.\n\nCBC News' language guide encourages the use of \"terms that do not exclude either sex,\" but the title 'ombudsman' is still used for the office that investigates complaints against the broadcaster.", "Video\n\nBallet students hit the road\n\nStudents with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School's professional division perform at Stanley Knowles School on Wednesday as part of their annual tour around Manitoba and northwestern Ontario.", "The wildfire situation in California is now the deadliest in the state's history, with at least 50 people killed, more than 100 missing or unaccounted for and the town of Paradise almost entirely destroyed.\n\nBut the footage coming out of affected communities tells an unexpected story, says a U.S. fire expert \u2014 one that could have lessons for wildfire prevention measures.\n\nThe town of Paradise, Calif. was almost entirely burned to the ground.

(Matthew Henderson/CBC)\n\nInstead of a wall of flames descending, burning embers blow downwind and ignite many spot fires over a wide area.\n\n\"That's how the whole area can be burning at the same time,\" Cohen explained.\n\nThat's also why, from the photos coming out of the damaged communities, it looks almost as though there were hundreds of individual house fires rather than one fire sweeping through the entire town.\n\nMore proactive measures are needed to fireproof homes \u2014 but that doesn't necessarily mean that trees need to be removed, says Jack Cohen. (Matthew Henderson)\n\nBattling ignition\n\nRemoving clutter around homes that could become combustible is crucial, he said, and making sure there is nothing touching a structure that could ignite it.\n\n\"We make sure that we have no debris on the structure. We make sure that nothing can burn ... within the first metre to metre-and-a-half [of the house],\" he said.\n\nAll that's left of a home in Paradise, Calif. after the Camp Fire devoured structures. (Matthew Henderson)\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean cutting back all vegetation.\n\nAs the photos show, large trees will still remain standing after a building burns down.\n\n\"Don't just look at destroyed structures,\" Cohen said. \"Look at the area around the destroyed structures and what you see is unconsumed vegetation.\"\n\nAt least 44 people have died and more than 100 people remain missing or unaccounted for in California's fires.

Not only does she have a job, she's become friends with her five co-workers and learned valuable business skills.\n\n\"I feel this project helps teenagers feel like, yeah, someone's really listening to us, and dreams can come true.\"\n\nShe came to the gig with some job experience. She runs a small business out of her home \u2014 braiding hair and doing makeup.\n\nBut after working at Press Start, she's changed her mind about what she wants to do after high school. Before, she planned to go to hairdressing school. Now, she wants to do business management.\n\nDuchesneau\u200b says she's watched all of the teens who run the co-op grow.

Pink asked Pepler whether it would be uncommon for a police officer to check the windows of a property with a reputation for prostitution, prowlers and drug dealing.\n\nPepler told Pink it wouldn't be uncommon, but he said no officer would ever conduct that kind of surveillance alone. Nor would an officer neglect to inform dispatch and keep a record of that kind of activity.\n\n\"If you leave a vehicle on foot, you update dispatch,\" Pepler said.\n\nPepler also testified that in 2017, the Esquire Motel had no such reputation among police officers.\n\nUndercover operation\n\nPepler said on the night of Dec. 1, an undercover female police officer wearing a tank top and shorts was set up inside one of the rooms. The undercover officer was in radio contact with two other officers outside the motel.\n\nPepler said Farmer approached the back window three times. Video surveillance captured by Halifax Regional Police showed Farmer unscrewing a nearby light bulb.\n\nFarmer was charged five days later on Dec. 6.\n\nHe has been suspended with pay since he was charged and has pleaded not guilty to all charges.", "This year's Red Cross Young Humanitarian credits much of his involvement in volunteer projects to growing up in a village.\n\nAustin Henderson is from Salisbury, a community of about 2,200 outside Moncton.

And I suggest to you that was a very risky decision to make. - Barry Learmonth\n\n\"We were never presented with this in my recollection,\" said Thompson. \"That's why it seemed so jarring to read about it in the Grant Thornton report. It was news to me.\"\n\nAnd as he has suggested before, inquiry co-counsel Barry Learmonth said it's evidence that Thompson and others were \"naive\" and \"blindly accepting\" of the work being done by Nalcor in the lead-up to the sanctioning of the massive project.\n\nMuskrat has been described as the biggest gamble in the province's history, one that now includes a price tag of nearly $13 billion and uncertainty about how the large debt will be repaid.\n\nIn one of several testy exchanges throughout the day Learmonth said, \"Government was simply accepting whatever Nalcor told you, with very little review. And I suggest to you that was a very risky decision to make.\"\n\nAll-in costs up by 70 per cent\n\nTotal costs for Muskrat have now soared by more than 70 per cent \u2014 more than $5 billion \u2014 since the project was sanctioned in 2012.\n\nThompson acknowledged that government did not carry out a review of the estimates brought forward by Nalcor, with the following explanation:\n\n\"In this context we had Nalcor, a Crown corporation, with a board of directors, shareholder alignment, with highly qualified people, and there had been these cold-eyes reviews by other consultants, so that was the context in which we felt satisfied to release [cost estimates] to the public.\"\n\nBarry Learmonth is co-counsel at the Muskrat Falls judicial inquiry. (Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\nLearmonth countered that government had a duty to scrutinize every move by Nalcor.\n\n'We did good work'\n\nThompson's testimony was similar to other government witnesses in that he said Nalcor was counted upon to provide accurate and timely information on everything from capital cost estimates and construction schedules to communications strategies with the public.\n\nThompson said government and Nalcor were an \"integrated\" team, and government accepted the estimates of Nalcor, just as it would if an independent engineer had provided cost estimates for a new hospital.\n\n\"We were relying at that point on the quality of the work that was going on within the project team in Nalcor and we were satisfied with the kinds of assurances we were being provided,\" Thompson testified.\n\nThompson disagreed with Learmonth's assertion that government was naive in its handling of Nalcor.\n\nHe said there were numerous independent reviews and there were constant meetings between senior government and Nalcor officials.\n\n\"We felt we were doing a credible job in providing independent oversight on the project at that time,\" he said.\n\nAs for the omission of the strategic reserve and the high-risk schedule for first power, answers to these questions are expected later in the inquiry when people like former Nalcor CEO Ed Martin and others are called to the witness stand.\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "Most of an Alberta family's valued powwow regalia has been recovered and five people have been charged, after the regalia \u2014 including custom-made jingle dresses \u2014 was stolen in Saskatoon late last month.\n\nThe regalia \u2014 including jingle dresses, moccasins and scarves \u2014 was reported stolen to Saskatoon police on Oct. 30.\n\nTanya Eagle Speaker, her husband and their two daughters, who are from the Blood Reserve in Alberta, were visiting Saskatoon for a powwow.

CBC News has not seen the letter.\n\nThe allegations aren't detailed in the book and neither is the name of the staffer.

In the book, Brown claims that when Fedeli became the interim party leader, the woman was let go \u2014 for undisclosed reasons \u2014 but kept on the legislative payroll.\n\nIn the days following Brown's resignation, Fedeli was a harsh critic of the former party leader.\n\n\"We watched in shock and horror and disappointment and sadness at these allegations,\" Fedeli told CBC News at the time. \"This is just plain and simply horrible.\"\n\nVic Fedeli, centre, was named interim leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservatives after Brown's resignation in early 2018.

Last September, MacDonald was acquitted of seven of the eight drug charges. He was found guilty of the eighth count, a lesser charge of possession of a controlled substance.\n\nDuring the trial, clips from surveillance video in the home showed images of the police officer which raised concerns about theft.\n\nA hidden camera captured the moment an Abbotsford police officer says he took money from a suspect\u2019s home and placed it in his sock as part of a joke, while carrying out a search warrant. 0:45\n\nMacDonald accused the officer of stealing cash, and his lawyer requested the trafficking charges be dropped.

It would have been the second time Calgary hosted. In 1988, it was the stage for the Jamaican bobsleigh team, Eddie the Eagle and the Battle of the Brians.\n\nWhat's next for Calgary?\n\nThe plebiscite result is non-binding, so the city council still has to officially kill the bid. But that will almost certainly happen in a vote on Monday. \"This is very clear direction for where we go from here,\" said mayor Naheed Nenshi, who was in favour of the Olympics.\n\nIt's possible Calgary could try for another one down the road, but it would take a lot of work to change the minds of citizens and the council. Both were pretty sharply divided on the 2026 bid.\n\nSports-wise, the next big thing for Calgary is figuring out what to do about the Saddledome. It's the oldest arena in the NHL if you don't count Madison Square Garden, which got a billion-dollar reno a few years ago. The Flames have threatened to move if they don't get a new building, but Calgary doesn't want to foot too much of the bill for it.\n\nWill Canada host the Olympics anytime soon?\n\nThe next available Olympics are in 2030, and no Canadian cities have expressed interest yet. Besides Calgary, Toronto (2024) and Quebec City (2026) kicked the tires on bids before bailing pretty early in the process. Montreal? Still licking its wounds from the financial disaster that was 1976. Vancouver still has a lot of the facilities for a Winter Olympics, but would it want to host again so soon after 2010? Beijing is doing it 14 years apart, though, so it's not impossible.\n\nWhat do the Olympics do now?\n\nCalgary's rejection is a big blow to the International Olympic Committee. The only two candidates left for 2026 are Stockholm and a joint Italian bid involving Milan and the alpine region of Cortina d'Ampezzo. Both are trying to overcome a lack of support from governments that don't want to spend taxpayer money on the Olympics.\n\nThat points to the IOC's larger, more existential problem: fewer and fewer places want to host the Olympics. Going back to Beijing gave off an air of desperation, and when both L.A. and Paris expressed interest in 2024, the IOC took the unprecedented step of awarding them both a Games (L.A. got 2028) before they could change their minds. The IOC has tried to make hosting more palatable by encouraging more austere bids. So far, it doesn't seem to be working.\n\nThe \"yes\" side didn't get the answer it wanted from Calgary voters.

Durant can become a free agent after this season, and there was already speculation before this incident that he'll leave Golden State.\n\nOne of football's biggest stars has chosen to sit out the season. All-Pro running back Le'Veon Bell had until late yesterday to accept a one-year, $14.4 million US offer from the Pittsburgh Steelers or else miss the entire year. The deadline passed, and Bell will have a chance to land the long-term contract he wants when he becomes a free agent in a few months. A similar situation is playing out in the NHL, where William Nylander is holding out for a better deal from the Leafs.\n\nThe NFL bailed on its game in Mexico City. A potential Super Bowl preview between the Rams and Chiefs this Monday night was moved out of Azteca Stadium because of poor field conditions. Some players reportedly even said they'd refuse to play for fear of being injured. The game will be played in the Rams' stadium in L.A. instead.\n\nYou're up to speed.

She left her job, never to return. She claimed the department failed to accommodate her physical disabilities. A human rights board of inquiry agreed and awarded her $51,000 for loss of past income and $35,000 in general damages.\n\nBut in a ruling released Wednesday, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal said the board of inquiry got it wrong when it found that Wakeham's inability to work was linked to the department's failure to accommodate her.\n\nAccording to evidence at both the inquiry hearing and the appeal hearing, Wakeham's problems began with two car accidents; one in 1999 and the other in 2005. She missed three years of work following the first accident. By 2006, she had pain issues and was consulting about 10 medical specialists.\n\nBeginning in 2009, Wakeham experienced lengthy absences from her job. According to figures supplied to the court by the Environment Department, Wakeham worked 90 per cent of the time in 2008. By 2010, that had slipped to less than 44 per cent. And for the period from April 2011 to February 2012, she was at work only about 10 per cent of the time.\n\nAccommodations\n\nWakeham's family physician filled out forms listing limitations that should be in place for her patient's return to work. She noted Wakeham had reduced ability when it came to sitting, standing, walking, bending/twisting, lifting, carrying, reaching, pushing or pulling.\n\nIn order to accommodate Wakeham, the department agreed to place her in a job with the following restrictions:\n\nNo responding to customers at the front desk.\n\nExclusion of telephone duties.\n\nWork in a quiet location.\n\nSitting for no more than two hours without a break.\n\nNo standing for more than 30 minutes without a break.\n\nNo walking more than one hour without a break.\n\nMaximum lifting of five pounds.\n\nWareham told the department that she developed anxiety because the new restrictions meant she would have to learn new job skills. At any rate, she didn't last long before she was off the job again.\n\nIn appealing the human rights board's decision, the department argued that it was contradictory for the board to find Wakeham was fit to work one day and then unfit a couple of weeks later when she complained about the way the department was treating her.\n\nMedical experts\n\nThe court found the board put too much emphasis on findings made by Wakeham's family physician, even though those findings had no foundation in fact.\n\nThe court said the board failed to consider evidence from medical experts hired by the department to review this case, including forensic psychiatrist Scott Theriault and occupational health physician Kevin Bourke.\n\nIn his review of the case, Theriault found that \"with respect to her cognitive issues I do not see anything that could successfully allow Ms. Wakeham to perform the basic functions of her job, even with accommodation.\"\n\nBourke was equally pessimistic.\n\n\"The likelihood of this employee's successful return to even part-time in her previous role(s) is exceedingly small in my opinion,\" he wrote. \"I have no recommendations in this regard.\"\n\nThe court found the human rights board also failed to weigh whether Wakeham was trying to return to work for financial reasons, because her long absences had exhausted much of her disability payments.\n\nThe court was also critical of Wakeham and the board for the long, drawn-out hearing process in this case.\n\n\"Careful expenditure of scarce public resources would suggest a better solution than the process pursued in this case,\" Justice Peter Bryson wrote for the three-member appeal panel.", "A 21-year-old woman was injured early Tuesday in a shooting at a home in Somerville, about 20 kilometres north of Woodstock.\n\nShots were fired through the front window of a residence on Highway 103 at around 2 a.m., RCMP said Wednesday.\n\n\"We don't believe it was a random act or that there's any risk to the public,\" said Cpl.

However, LeVasseur said he believes that protection isn't always guaranteed, especially at senior levels.\n\n\"You don't want to be put on the blacklist,\" he said.\n\nLeVasseur adds whistleblowers may still face less obvious consequences, such as being overlooked for a promotion or special project.", "The Nova Scotia government is asking for feedback from parents and guardians about the school bus system.\n\nAn online survey launched Wednesday and will be available until Dec. 5.\n\nThe survey aims to provide information about the current level of service and help shape future student transportation policy.\n\nThe survey asks how concerned parents are about length of time on the bus, busing distance, pickup and drop-off times, communications and safety.\n\nIt also asks whether the bus arrives at school on time, whether the parent or guardian gets advanced notice when the bus is late and what a reasonable distance is for the school system to be responsible for transporting children.\n\nThere is also an opportunity to provide general comments or feedback.\n\nResults will be made public\n\nA summary of the results of the survey will be shared publicly.\n\nThe survey and an internal review of bus services come after parents complained about buses this fall.\n\nThe night before school started this September, some parents in the Halifax area expressed frustration that a website intended to provide information about bus services didn't give schedules for their routes.\n\nOther parents have raised concerns about stops being located several kilometres away from home or having a two-hour transit time for a one-way trip to a school.", "The Alberta government launched a lost-revenue counter on Wednesday that suggests $80 million is being lost across the country each day without the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal ruled against the $7.4-billion project on Aug. 30, saying the federal government had failed to conduct meaningful consultations with Indigenous people, as required by law.\n\nThe counter will be displayed on digital advertising boards at locations near Parliament Hill in Ottawa, and supported in various broadcast and digital formats across the country, said Deron Bilous, Alberta's economic development and trade minister.\n\n\"We will keep the federal government's feet to the fire so that this project isn't delayed any further,\" Bilous said. \"This is a project that is absolutely critical, that needs to move forward.\"\n\nAlberta's Keep Canada Working campaign is making a difference, Bilous said.\n\nIn early 2016, four in 10 Canadians wanted to see the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion move ahead.\n\nThat number is now seven in 10, an increase Bilous said is due to Alberta's nationwide efforts.\n\nThe Alberta government has spent $10 million on the campaign so far, he said.

Barriss, 26, admitted in court Tuesday making the false report resulting in a death, as well as cyberstalking and conspiracy related to the deadly swatting calls in Kansas. Swatting is when a call is made to police claiming that a major incident, often involving hostages, is unfolding at a residence and usually results in a tactical team being deployed.\n\nThe deal with prosecutors will send him to prison for between 20 and 25 years, if the judge accepts it.

Authorities say Barris researched the address Viner had given him for Gaskill and verified it was a home.\n\nWhen Gaskill noticed Barriss was following him on Twitter, he began communicating with Barriss through direct messages in which he also gave him that same old address and dared him to swat him.\n\n\"Please try some s\u2014-.

There have been several too-close-for-comfort encounters in the skies over the Black Sea in recent weeks, including a near-collision with a U.S. Navy plane Nov. 5, and a late October incident where Canadian jets intercepted a Russian aircraft near Romanian airspace.\n\nThere are persistent rumours that Robert Mueller is about to drop a round of indictments connected to his probe of alleged collusion between the Kremlin and Trump's 2016 election campaign. The buzz is that they may target the president's son, Donald Jr., his gadfly advisor Roger Stone, or Jerome Corsi, a former Infowars writer who may or may not have had \"prior knowledge\" of hacked Hillary Clinton campaign emails.\n\nAlthough, as Mueller has already charged 26 Russian nationals and three companies in connection with his investigation and elicited only denials from the Kremlin, it doesn't seem likely that Putin is about to cop to any criminal wrongdoing. Even as the Russians have filed a defense in a civil suit brought by the Clinton campaign that characterizes any electoral interference that may possibly have happened as a \"military operation,\" and thereby shielded from foreign legal actions.\n\nThere are also issues of global concern, like the unravelling U.S.-Russia treaty on intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Trump has indicated he intends to pull out , and America plans to modernize its own nuclear arsenal with \"low yield\" bombs that make the Kremlin very uneasy.\n\nAll the while, the Cold War shows signs of rapid heating.\n\nA new report issued today by the U.S. National Defense Strategy Commission \u2014 a non-partisan panel of former national security officials \u2014 includes some dire warnings about how America might lose a major conflict with Russia or China.\n\nHelicopters fly above servicemen running to positions during the joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises Zapad-2017 (West-2017) at a training ground near the town of Borisov on Sept. 20, 2017.

(Associated Press)\n\nCannabis is present in your bloodstream for up to four weeks after consuming, but that doesn't mean you're impaired. The RCMP says there is no reliable test to detect impaired drivers, so imagine the difficulty employers are now facing.\n\nTake the police themselves, for instance. Their \"workplace\" involves the need for clear-headed, split-second decisions when officers are involved in whole range of situations, from high-speed driving to whether to use force. And the workplace policies on cannabis adopted by different forces vary widely:\n\nIn Calgary, cops can smoke cannabis 24 hours before going on duty.\n\nToronto's service says its officers can consume it, but not within 28 days of going on duty.\n\nOntario's provincial force is banning its members from ever smoking pot (an approach very likely to be challenged in court).\n\nIn a similar move to that of the Toronto police, Canada's two major airlines have ordered their pilots to stay away from cannabis for 28 days before flying.

Later that afternoon, the company also reported damage to a transmission tower near the town of Pulga, close to where the fire is believed to have begun some time that day.\n\nPulga resident Betsey Ann Cowley says the company contacted her in the days before the November 8 to request access to her property to repair transmission lines because \"they were having problems with sparks,\" she said the company told her in an email.\n\nThe so-called Camp Fire is on its way to being the most expensive in the history of the state. (Matthew Henderson)\n\nState records show the first reports of a fire in the area came at around 6:30 a.m. that morning. So far the fire has consumed 125,000 acres and is 30 per cent contained. Fire officials don't expect it to be fully under control until the end of the month at the earliest.\n\nPrior to the 8th, the company had also been warning customers that it may shut off gas and electricity services in the region as a precaution, because the risk of fire was so great. But the company elected not to go ahead with the shut down in Butte County and other areas, citing poor weather conditions.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit launched by Northern California Fire Lawyers in the San Francisco County Superior Court on Tuesday, the company is liable for the damage that ensued, which most recent estimates peg at more than $15 billion US.\n\n\"Despite its own recognition of these impending hazardous conditions, on the day of the Camp Fire's ignition, PG&E ultimately made the decision not to proceed with its plans for a power shutoff,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nPG&E says it doesn't have enough insurance to cover the costs. (Ken James/Bloomberg)\n\nButte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told KRCR television on Wednesday that attributing the fire to PG&E at this point was \"speculative.\"\n\n\"It's important to remember that the cause (of the Camp Fire) has yet to be determined,\" PG&E said in a statement. \"Right now, our primary focus is on the communities, supporting first responders and getting our crews positioned and ready to respond when we get access, so that we can safely restore gas and electricity to our customers.\"\n\nThe company did warn investors on Tuesday, however, that it had tapped into a $3.3 billion credit facility to shore up cash, and added it is covered for up to about $1.4 billion in liability insurance.\n\nBut those figures combined could be nowhere near enough to cover the costs of the massive blaze if the company is found liable in any serious way.\n\n\"While the cause of the Camp Fire is still under investigation, if the utility's equipment is determined to be the cause, the utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage,\" the company said in the filing.\n\nBloomberg untility analyst Kit Konolige said the bill could be for more than the company is worth. \"Unless mitigated by regulators, we expect PG&E's write-offs could exceed the company's total equity,\" Konolige said.\n\nThat sent shares plunging.

They are the largest land mammal in the province, and on the mainland, they're facing imminent extinction. Clifford Paul is the moose management coordinator for Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources in Cape Breton. 6:20\n\nWhat's killing them\n\nOnly a few pockets of moose still live on the mainland, including in the southwest, Guysborough and Antigonish counties and the Cobequid region. Meanwhile, the population in Cape Breton is abundant, with an estimated 5,000 moose.\n\nLoss of habitat due to clear cutting and human development is a major culprit, said Paul.\n\nSo are ticks.\n\nGlobal warming and human activity has forced more deer into the province, which carry bloody-sucking insects that can climb onto moose.\n\nClifford Paul is the moose management co-ordinator for the Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources in Cape Breton. (Submitted by Clifford Paul)\n\nPaul said it's possible for one moose to have tens of thousands of ticks on it. The animals then spend more of their energy trying to replace the blood they lose.\n\n\"The animal will rub against trees and scratch up against rocks ... to rid themselves of these ticks and in the process they lose their hair,\" said Paul. \"They call it a ghost moose because it has a no hair left on its body.\"\n\nMainland moose are also battling ATV activity in their habitat and poaching.\n\nHow we can save them\n\nPaul said it's not as simple as moving moose to the mainland from Cape Breton because they are a different subspecies.\n\n\"If you take them out of an order in Cape Breton and put them in a place where there's ringworm, ticks, habitat loss, and lots of factors that are not conducive to their survival, I think it's inhumane.\"\n\nRather, Paul said it's about better protecting the lands where they live.\n\n\"I'm out there to manage ecosystems where moose can thrive, and other animals of the boreal forest can thrive.

Companies will either have to lower their emissions or buy credits if they can't meet their targets.\n\nTo begin with, the province announced Wednesday, 13,683,000 emission credits will be mostly available free of charge in 2019. Nova Scotia Power will receive 6,334,000, or 46 per cent them.\n\nMost of the rest will be divvied up between almost two dozen other companies whose emissions are bad enough to warrant their inclusion in the greenhouse-gas reduction program. In addition to Nova Scotia Power, they include the Lafarge Canada cement plant in Brookfield, Irving Oil and other gasoline importers, companies that produce or import furnace oil, as well as natural gas distributors.\n\nThe market\n\nThe Nova Scotia government estimates those free credits equate to about 90 per cent of Nova Scotia Power's needs. It means the utility will have to reduce emissions and buy additional credits through government auctions. The province has set a $20 per credit floor price.\n\nFuel suppliers will receive for free about 80 per cent of what they will need.\n\nThe Ecology Action Centre on Wednesday welcomed some aspects of the plan, including putting money raised at credit auctions into a new Nova Scotia Green Fund that could generate between $25 million and $30 million a year for \"low-carbon programming.\"\n\nBut the Halifax-based group also criticized the province's emissions reduction targets from cap-and-trade, saying they aren't strong enough in the face climate change.\n\nSmaller market\n\nUnlike other jurisdictions, the credits generated in Nova Scotia can only be traded within the province, which is why the government is restricting how they can be exchanged and setting limits on how many can be traded. All told, the regulations published Wednesday run 47 pages.\n\nJason Hollett, the executive director of climate change with the Department of Environment, said those rules were needed because of Nova Scotia's unique system.\n\n\"It's important primarily because we understand that the market in Nova Scotia is a lot smaller than what you would see in other cap-and-trade markets,\" he said. \"So the limitations that are placed on purchasing and the regulations are meant to ensure that there are enough greenhouse-gas allowances for all participants in the province.\"\n\nCredits will decrease\n\nThe number of available credits will decrease by roughly one per cent over each of the four years of the program. Companies will be expected to lower their emissions year over year, but those that don't meet their targets will be expected to buy credits from those that do as compensation.\n\nThose trades happen through private transactions between program participants or confidentially through a Nova Scotia government auction. According to the regulations posted Wednesday, there will be a minimum of two auctions a year, starting in 2020.\n\nThe Nova Scotia government has previously said it expects consumers to pay about a penny more a litre for gasoline and heating oil, and about the same amount per cubic metre of natural gas. There's also a potential increase of about one percent on Nova Scotia Power bills starting next year.\n\nThere are no restrictions on credit trades between companies, but Nova Scotia Environment Minister Margaret Miller does have the power to limit trades, cancel deals and block companies from participating in auctions if he feels those companies are not playing by the rules or are trying to manipulate the price of credits.\n\nThe province has set a $20 per credit floor price, but has set aside a percentage of credits in a strategic reserve that can be made available, as a last resort, to companies that need credits but can't find a company willing or able to trade. Those credits will cost $50 each.", "U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis defended the deployment of thousands of troops to the border with Mexico as he traveled there on Wednesday, saying the mission was \"absolutely legal\" and justified, and that it was improving military readiness.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's politically charged decision to send troops to the Mexico border came ahead of U.S. midterm congressional elections last week, as Trump sought to strengthen border security as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nTrump's supporters, including Republicans in Congress, have embraced the deployment.\n\nBut critics have assailed the decision, calling it a political stunt to drive Republican voters to the polls. They have scoffed at Trump's comparison of caravans of Central American migrants, including women and children, to an \"invasion.\"\n\nMattis, speaking to a small group of reporters traveling with him, rejected criticism and said the deployment was the right thing to do.\n\n\"It's very clear that support to border police or border patrol is necessary right now,\" Mattis said, noting that that was the assessment of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nHe added the deployment was deemed legal by Trump administration attorneys and was improving readiness by giving troops more experience in rapid deployment.\n\n'Dynamic situation'\n\nThe visit took Mattis near the Texas town of Donna, where U.S. troops have set up a base camp near a border crossing point with Mexico. General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the head of U.S. Northern Command, greeted him as he landed.\n\nMattis said U.S. soldiers were making rapid progress erecting barriers along the border and estimated the first, construction phase of the U.S. military effort could be completed within 10 days.\n\n\"I would anticipate with what we've been asked to do so far, probably within a week to 10 days, we'll have done what's needed,\" Mattis told the reporters. \"Of course, it will be a dynamic situation and there will be new requests coming in.\"\n\nMattis, alongside Nielsen, addresses troops at Base Camp Donna in Donna, Texas. (Phil Stewart/Reuters)\n\nMattis said the U.S. military was also rehearsing helicopter operations to help support U.S. border personnel, potentially flying them to new locations if the caravans of migrants shift direction.\n\nThe deployed U.S. troops are not expected to directly interact with migrants, most are unarmed, and they are only assigned tasks that support U.S. border personnel, including building temporary lodging.\n\nCongressional opposition\n\nTrump's Democratic opponents have threatened to investigate the matter once they take control of the House of Representatives early next year after gaining a majority in the House in the midterm elections.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security, told Reuters that Trump had used the military \"as a prop to stoke fear and score political points.\"\n\n\"We will soon be finally able to conduct oversight of this gross abuse and the President's many failed border security policies,\" said Thompson, who is expected to lead the committee when the Democrats take control of the House.\n\nIt is unclear how long the deployment will last. Mattis initially authorized it through mid-December but it could be extended.\n\nMattis estimated about 5,900 troops were participating in the border mission. The U.S. military has offered a breakdown accounting for 5,600 of them, estimating about 2,800 troops in Texas, 1,500 in Arizona and another 1,300 in California.\n\nAsked whether troops' families should expect their loved ones to remain deployed through Thanksgiving or even Christmas, Mattis declined to speculate.\n\n\"We are a 365-day-a-year military. Rain or Shine. Light or dark. Cold weather or hot weather,\" he said, declining to estimate costs of the deployment until he had better data.\n\nMattis is briefed on the U.S. military's border deployment at Base Camp Donna, Texas.

No payments were ever made on these loans,\" Skrabek said.\n\nPolice said the 79-year-old became brain injured in a serious motor vehicle collision in 1977 and has been receiving $20,000 tax free every month for nearly 30 years.\n\nThe injury caused the man to be overly trusting, vulnerable and easily taken advantage of regarding financial matters, police said.\n\nGrenier had been acting as his financial advisor since at least 2008, and had full control over the elderly man's investments, police said.\n\nAime Edmond Grenier has been sanctioned twice by the Insurance Council of Manitoba, the regulatory body for insurance brokers and agents.

However, [the] accused would reap the benefit of commissions each time he moved the victim's business or leveraged investment loans on his behalf.\"\n\nPolice also learned Grenier had \"steered\" the victim into investing more than $450,000 in high-risk investments in several private companies, Skrabek said.\n\nGrenier wasn't licensed by the Manitoba Securities Commission to sell securities, but police said he acted as a \"facilitator,\" introducing the victim to the owners of the companies; in one case, he took an owner to the senior's home.\n\n\"Throughout the investigation it became readily apparent that the victim had very little knowledge of what was being done with his money, nor did he fully comprehend the risks involved in the alternative investments,\" Skrabek said.\n\n\"The victim trusted the accused completely and the accused was leveraging the victim's financial means and generosity to make money and obtain loans.\"\n\nPolice said while some of Grenier's actions were \"morally questionable,\" they were not \"overtly criminal in nature.\"", "Liam Veale could be one of the smartest kids in Canada.\n\nThe 12-year-old from Quispamsis was watching a hockey game with his father when he saw an ad for the CBC-TV game show competition, Canada's Smartest Person Jr.\n\n\"I turned to my dad and said, 'Maybe I should do this,'\" said Veale, a student at Harry Miller Middle School.\n\nHe filled out an application online and made his way through each round of the audition process.\n\nAt the beginning of the summer, he got the news he was going to be on the show.\n\nThe show premi\u00e8res tonight at 8 o'clock, but Veale already knows the outcome of the whole season, a secret he's had to keep since filming wrapped this summer.\n\n\"I don't want to get sued, so that plays a big part in it,\" he said.\n\nVeale said the show tests competitors on six levels of intelligence \u2014 physical, logical, musical, linguistic, social and visual.\n\nHe said he excels in the physical and logic tests.\n\n\"I think it's kind of like the big sports names \u2026 it's a bit of natural talent mixed with very hard work.\"\n\nVeale is a mathlete and finished ahead of opponents in higher age groups in a provincial math competition at the University of New Brunswick in Saint John.\n\nWhen he first arrived at the big studio in Toronto for Canada's Smartest Person Jr., he felt shy, but that soon changed.\n\nLiam Veale said he made lifelong friendships with his fellow competitors.

Not even the people of Calgary.\n\nThe No side won with 56.4 per cent of the vote, a total of 304,774 people cast ballots across the city. 3:43\n\nThese are people who are reminded daily of the positive legacy of the 1988 Olympics in terms of facilities, international reputation, and a sporting culture which has undeniably enriched the lives of its many citizens for more than one generation.\n\nBut history, it seems, is just that, a thing of the past.\n\nRisks seemed to outweigh benefits\n\nWhat counted most in the majority of voters' minds, as this plebiscite demonstrated, was not the potential benefit of hosting the Olympics again, the Paralympics for the first time, or the community building that might result, but the risks associated with such an effort.\n\nThe bid was modest, responsible, and in keeping with a modern vision for the Olympics. The case was made that the Paralympic Winter Games were not hosted in Calgary in 1988 and that this was an opportunity to make the city more accessible and inclusive, and the envy of the world.\n\nThe bid committee planned to refurbish existing venues, utilize past experience in hosting the Games, build contingencies to protect against cost overruns, tighten security \u2014 and renew a strong legacy while stimulating a slumping economy.\n\nAnother Olympics and Paralympics, the advocates argued, would showcase Calgary on the global stage and help bring the city together.\n\nWarning signs in council\n\nInstead, the proposed bid divided the people. You could see it coming as late as Oct. 31 when city council almost abandoned the process. There was name calling and more than one accusation that creative accounting had been done to make the financial arrangements seem more palatable.\n\nOne councillor expressed a reservation to do business with the federal government. Some said they didn't understand the numbers on the ledger and that there were surely other, more pressing, priorities for the city budget.\n\nMore than a few of the politicians were wary of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and a perceived, recent tendency for corruption and irresponsibility when it comes to staging the Olympics.\n\nDoping scandals, greed, fiscal mismanagement and massive security concerns all got a thorough airing out as this debate plodded on. Outspoken Olympians and Paralympians came out to support the bid, but the backlash on social media was most disturbing. Some of these athletes were portrayed as an elite group of entitled, sports people looking to waste a bunch of money on a two-week party.\n\nThese are the same athletes who the city, province, and country eagerly celebrated at previous Olympic and Paralympic Games. They are the very same athletes who have gone on to become civic leaders and major contributors to the health of Calgary's communal narrative.\n\nIt is startling to see something decline in value. It's not as if Calgary is the only city to pass on hosting the modern Games by way of plebiscite. The German cities of Munich and Hamburg have done the same. Boston and Oslo pulled out of bids. Past hosts St. Moritz, Switzerland, and Innsbruck, Austria, have also said no recently.\n\nThe fact is, fewer and fewer cities are enamoured with the Olympics and by extension, the Paralympics.\n\nOpportunity lost, or mistake avoided?\n\nWhereas Canadians held their breath in anticipation of Vancouver being chosen to host the 2010 Games, the majority of people in Calgary, the city that pulled off one of the most successful Winter Games ever, turned their noses up at the prospect of another and more complete chance.\n\nIt's no one's fault and there are no villains here on the yes or the no side. Many will say it's an opportunity lost. Others are firm in their belief that it's a mistake avoided.\n\nThe real loser here is the Olympic movement itself.\n\nThere is little doubt that had Calgary gone ahead with its ambition to bid for the 2026 Games, it would have become the frontrunner to win the competition. Surviving bids from Cortina/Milan, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden have no government funding and few of the infrastructure advantages that Calgary's now abandoned bid had.\n\nAll of which means those who run the Olympics have to take a long, hard, look at themselves and what they're doing to their brand. It's very revealing that they are now held in such low esteem that they desperately wanted Calgary, but as it turns out Calgary didn't want them.\n\nQuestions will immediately surround Calgary's existing legacy. What becomes of the facilities?\n\nWill they be renewed and refurbished? More importantly, what happens to the intangible and infectious Olympic spirit which has characterized the place for the last 30 years?\n\nCalgary is identified as an Olympic city \u2014 it always will be. It is without question one of the landmark hosts in Winter Games history.\n\nThat said, the past is all too often, easy to forget. This result which says no to another Games means the people of Calgary are sending the people in charge of the Olympics a very clear message: Wake up and look to a better future in a hurry.", "Health officials in Nain say screening efforts for tuberculosis are being expanded to prevent further spread of the disease, after dozens of cases have been reported.\n\nSylvia Doody, director of health services with the Nunatsiavut government, said they've been working hard to follow up active cases since the death of 14-year-old Gussie Bennett in March.\n\n\"To date we have a total of 25 cases, 19 cases of which are lab confirmed, and six clinical cases of TB as well,\" she told CBC Radio's Labrador Morning.\n\nWe're very confident that we have done a thorough review \u2026 and we're now at a point where we can look at expanding our screening efforts. - Sylvia Doody\n\n\"This is an outbreak, something that we have been investigating \u2026 since March and certainly has been a lot of work ongoing since then.\"\n\nDoody said when active cases of TB are discovered, the priority is to treat the disease to prevent it from being spread. The next step is to find anyone else who may have come in contact with the disease, and she said about 600 people have been screened since March \u2014 nearly half the population of Nain.\n\nAbout 500 more people will likely be screened when testing is expanded, she said.\n\n\"We are now at a point where we're very confident that we have done a thorough review of that contact investigation and we're now at a point where we can look at expanding our screening efforts to broaden up to provide all residents of Nain with an opportunity to come in and be screened for tuberculosis,\" said Doody.\n\n'Sleeping' infection can cause outbreaks\n\nProper screening is important, Doody said, because the TB infection can lie dormant in otherwise healthy people for many years. A high burden of latent infection in a community can lead to outbreaks, as people age and their immune systems become more vulnerable to the \"sleeping\" disease.\n\n\"TB is spread, as you know, through the air, so when someone coughs, if they have active disease in their lungs, they cough and the bugs go into the air, so someone can easily breath in those germs,\" Doody said.\n\n\"And then sometimes those germs, depending on the person's immune system, they may go on to develop active disease, or they may stay in their lungs and their body walls off the infection and they lie dormant or sleeping.\"\n\nGussie Bennett, 14, of Nain died of tuberculosis. (Submitted by Katie Suarak)\n\nShe said the Nunatsiavut government is working on a broad strategy to end TB in the region by 2030, although it may never be possible to fully eradicate the disease.\n\nAnd while there is always risk of spreading the disease, Doody said there is no need for precaution when travelling to Nain.\n\nWith files from Labrador Morning\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "Alberta's education minister is threatening to pull funding from 28 private school authorities if they don't comply with legislation permitting gay-straight alliances.\n\nDavid Eggen said he has issued ministerial orders establishing standard policies for GSAs for the 28 private school authorities that have failed to meet requirements under An Act to Support Gay-Straight Alliances which passed in December.\n\n\"It is my expectation that these school authorities shall comply with the ministerial order,\" Eggen told a news conference Wednesday. \"If they don't, they will lose their taxpayer funding subsidy for the next school year.\n\n\"Following this law is not optional,\" Eggen warned. \"Ensuring that vulnerable students feel safe is not optional in the province of Alberta; not in today's Alberta and not when you receive up to 70 per cent of your funding from taxpayers.\n\n\"If you're taking public money, you follow the law.\"\n\nEggen said to his knowledge no Alberta education minister has ever held back funding from a private school for any reason.\n\nThe 28 schools, which represent about 4,000 students, must post the standard policy in a prominent location on the homepages of their websites by June 30, 2019, he said.\n\nIf they wait until the last moment to comply \"that doesn't bode well\" for their future, he said.\n\nEggen would not say whether he would close the schools altogether if they continued to defy the law.\n\n\"The right for a school to exist also is under The School Act, under the minister's approval,\" he said.\n\nEggen praised the 66 remaining accredited, funded private school authorities that did meet the legal requirements, many of which he said worked one-on-one with the government in order to comply.\n\n\"It's interesting, because we have the whole Catholic school system, which is a faith-based system [with] probably a 170,000 kids, 17 school boards, hundreds of schools, and they built compliance,\" he said.\n\nAn advocacy group challenging GSA legislation in court says the ministerial order is \"not properly grounded in law.\"\n\nThe order overrides parental rights protected by the Alberta Bill of Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, said the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms in a statement Wednesday.\n\nSchool authorities that have not posted a compliant policy:\n\n40-Mile Christian Education Society\n\nCalvin Christian School Society of the Netherlands Reformed Congregations\n\nCanadian Reformed School Society of Edmonton\n\nHigh Level Christian Education Society\n\nKoinonia Christian School - Red Deer Society\n\nLiving Truth Christian School Society\n\nNewell Christian School Society\n\nThe Father's House Christian Fellowship-Sturgeon County\n\nYellowhead Koinonia Christian School Society\n\nSchool authorities that have not posted a compliant policy and code of conduct:", "A watchdog for children and youth services in Manitoba says it will be investigating the death of Christopher Dwight Beaulieu McIvor, a 17-year-old who died from gunshot wounds on Saturday in Winnipeg.\n\nMcIvor, better known as Teddy, died after being shot with a long gun early Saturday morning at a bungalow on Sherburn Street.\n\nMarilyn Davis, McIvor's grandmother, said she was happy to hear the Manitoba Advocate for Children and Youth will be looking into her grandson's case.\n\n\"I'm finding out my grandson had a lot of freedom.

It's not half of it but it's getting close to half,\" he said.\n\nWCS discounts are expected to fall to about US$25 per barrel in the first quarter of 2019, he said, due to factors including voluntary production cuts by Alberta producers, increases in crude-by-rail exports and the end of maintenance shutdowns at U.S. refineries that process Canadian crude.\n\nPlant producing diesel from synthetic crude\n\nSturgeon, the first new refinery built in Alberta in more than 30 years, has been producing diesel from synthetic crude upgraded at an Alberta oilsands mine for the past 11 months.\n\nMacGregor said the operation is benefiting financially as high price discounts on stranded Alberta heavy oil have also begun to affect light oil and synthetic oil, leading to its feedstock costing as much as US$30 per barrel less than usual.\n\nHe says the refinery is currently producing between 35,000 and 40,000 barrels per day of diesel.\n\n\"If the numbers stay like this, they're going to be astounding when we're running on bitumen,\" he said.\n\nIn spite of that, he said he thinks it \"makes sense\" for the Alberta government to impose industry-wide production cuts, as suggested by producer Cenovus Energy Inc., to better align output with pipeline space to boost prices and protect its royalty stream.\n\nThe refinery is a joint venture of North West Refining and oilsands producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., which is to provide 25 per cent of its bitumen feedstock.\n\nThe rest is to come from the government-owned Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, which can collect royalties in the form of bitumen.", "The Pittsburgh Penguins have traded forward Carl Hagelin to the Los Angeles Kings for forward Tanner Pearson.\n\nThe 30-year-old Hagelin is off to a sluggish start for Pittsburgh this season, with just one goal and two assists in 16 games.\n\nHe played a pivotal role in Pittsburgh's run to consecutive Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017.

Addis Ababa has been locked in a military standoff with Eritrea since a 1998-2000 border war in which 80,000 people are thought to have died.\n\nAhmed has attempted to broker peace with ONLF, a group the government previously outlawed as a \"terrorist group.\"\n\n\"He said they are not terrorists anymore,\" Abdulkadir said of Ahmed. \"He said he would treat everyone fairly and he wanted every Ethiopian to come back to the country.\n\n\"That was the window of opportunity that we took on.\"\n\n'A fragile peace'\n\nIt was during this shift in the political landscape that Abdulkadir \u2014 executive director of the Ogaden Somali Community of Alberta Residents and a longtime advocate for peace in Ethiopia \u2014 was called upon to help.\n\nAt the invitation of ONLF members, Abdulkadir flew to Addis Ababa on Aug. 4. He spent months attending more than 100 meetings and acting as a middle man between the two sides.\n\nThe trip marked the only time he had returned to his home country since 1991.\n\nWatching the conflict from afar in Edmonton, Abdulkadir said he's had many sleepless, tearful nights over the years, feeling helpless and restless.\n\nWhen the call came, he was keen to help.\n\nIt seemed the country's best chance for peace in decades, Abdulkadir said.\n\n\"That's what made me made go back, expecting that I would be put in jail when I landed there,\" he said.\n\nAfter months of tense negotiations, an agreement was finally signed on Oct. 21. It stipulates that both sides end hostilities and that the ONLF would \"pursue its political obligations through peaceful means.\"\n\nAbdulkadir's optimism for his home country is restrained.\n\n\"I'm pessimistically hopeful,\" Abdulkadir said of the prospect of long term peace. \"I'm grateful that this peace deal took place but it's fragile.\n\n\"It depends on how long this prime minister stays in power \u2014 which is sad \u2014 and how the international community enforces this peace.\"", "Staff at the Gila Regional Medical Centre in New Mexico got a hearty \"thank you\" from Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister for treating him.\n\nHe's also returning to complete the hike that nearly took his life.\n\nThe premier returned to Silver City, N.M., almost a year after he got lost on a hiking trail in the Gila Wilderness, a 2,200-square kilometre protected area in southwestern New Mexico.\n\nHe's said he was grateful to be alive after getting lost in the New Mexico wilderness for hours before falling down an embankment, breaking his arm and bruising his ribs.\n\nThe ordeal shook Pallister, who was nearly in tears last year describing how he got lost.\n\n\"It was the worst day of my life,\" he said at the time.\n\nHe also called the region of New Mexico \"a beautiful place,\" and vowed to return, despite the accident.\n\nManitoba Premier Brian Pallister suffered multiple injuries and numerous cuts and bruises after getting lost and falling while on a hike in New Mexico. (Submitted/Brian Pallister)\n\nPallister followed through on his promise, surprising medical professionals at the Gila Regional Medical Centre with his gratefulness a few days ago, said Taffy Arias, hospital CEO.\n\n\"I have never met a man who was so gracious and so complimentary of each and every person that took care of him,\" Arias said. \"He went out of his way to acknowledge everyone in a personal manner to let them know that he remembered them, he remembered their names, he remembered what they did for him.\"\n\nRemembered every name\n\n\"For someone, especially someone in his position, who must come in contact with many individuals in his career to specifically say to himself I'm going to remember these people's names so I can come back and thank them, that was most impressive for us.\"\n\nPallister offered a Canadian flag as a gift and posed for pictures with staff, who were \"unbelievably surprised\" at how the six-foot-eight politician towered over them.\n\nOne staff member was no taller than Pallister's waist, Arias said.\n\n\"It's a very charming picture,\" she said.\n\nA year ago, Pallister and his wife, Esther \u2014 who have hiked thousands of kilometres before \u2014 embarked on what they thought would be a six-hour hike, separately.\n\nAn emotional Brian Pallister recalls the hiking experience that nearly took his life in a press conference with media on Nov. 21, 2017. (John Woods/The Canadian Press)\n\nPallister fell behind on his leg of the journey, he explained last year, and eventually found himself alone in the dark.\n\nHe would run into barbed wire and became cold and dehydrated.\n\n\"I started to shake and I knew I had to get up,\" Pallister said last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Esther used the light on her cellphone to finish hiking and make it to their vehicle. When her husband didn't show up, she drove to the other end of the trail before calling police.\n\nSearch efforts dimmed\n\nBefore long, Pallister noticed the beam of an officer's flashlight until the light went out.\n\nPallister started to scream as loudly as he could to get the officer's attention, he said, and finally heard the response of the siren.\n\nAs he approached, the light suddenly came back on and blinded Pallister as he tried to climb over a fence toward the officer.\n\n\"About two steps later I started to slide,\" Pallister recalled.\n\nPremier Brian Pallister says he's grateful to be alive after getting lost in the New Mexico desert wilderness last week, leaving him with a broken arm, bruised ribs and lacerations all over. 7:15\n\nHe put his hands and feet down to try and steady himself, but it was too steep and too dark. As he slid, his arm got caught and twisted behind him \u2014 causing a compound fracture.\n\n\"Then I got air, and I'm just praying: no rocks,\" Pallister said.\n\n\"And then I landed flat, blew out the sides of both my hiking boots on landing.

On Wednesday, the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature updated mountain gorillas' status from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered,\" a more promising, if still precarious, designation. There are now just over 1,000 of the animals in the wild.\n\n\"In the context of crashing populations of wildlife around the world, this is a remarkable conservation success,\" said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientist of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.\n\nFossey, shown in Washington, on Sept. 24, 1970, 15 years before her death, had projected that gorillas may be extinct by 2000, but their populations have been increasing thanks to conservation efforts. (Associated Press)\n\nThe Atlanta-based non-profit is named for the primate researcher whose work helped draw international attention to mountain gorillas and whose memoir became the basis for the 1988 Sigourney Weaver film Gorillas in the Mist.\n\n\"This is a beacon of hope \u2014 and it's happened in recently war-torn and still very poor countries,\" said Stoinski, also a member of the IUCN's primate specialist group, which recommended the status change.\n\nMaking progress\n\nMountain gorillas live in lush and misty forests along a range of dormant volcanoes in east Africa. Their habitat falls inside national parks spanning parts of Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nFossey, who died in 1985, had projected that the primates may be extinct by 2000. Instead, their populations have been slowly increasing thanks to sustained and well-funded international conservation efforts.\n\nA baby mountain gorilla rides on its mother's back on the slopes of Mount Mikeno in the Virunga National Park, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. (Peter Andrews/Reuters)\n\n\"We have made progress in terms of their protection, in terms of allowing an environment where mountain gorillas can continue to thrive and grow,\" said Anna Behm Masozera, director of the International Gorilla Conservation Program, based in Kigali, Rwanda. \"But it's important to note that mountain gorillas' numbers could still slip back very quickly. We still have just two fragile and small populations,\" split between two national park areas.\n\nSeveral factors have enabled mountain gorillas' modest rebound, said Masozera.\n\nThe three governments have stepped up enforcement of national park boundaries \u2014 areas where hunting, logging and paved roads are illegal.\n\nTourism helps too: Visitors pay up to $1,500 an hour to watch gorillas, money that helps pay for park rangers.\n\n\"Primate ecotourism, done right, can be a really significant force for funding conservation,\" said Russ Mittermeier, chief conservation officer at Global Wildlife Conservation. \"It gives local governments and communities a tangible economic incentive to protect these habitats and species.\"\n\nThere's also health care. Gorilla Doctors, a nongovernmental group, has trained veterinary staff in each of the countries where the mountain gorillas live.\n\nHunting in the national parks is illegal, but nearby residents still set traps to catch other animals, such as antelopes. Those traps can also grab gorillas' arms and legs.\n\nWhen gorillas are found struggling with snares, the vets are called in to clean wounds. Kirsten Gilardi, U.S. director for the organization, called it \"extreme conservation.\"\n\nOther experts said the emergency vet interventions play a significant role in maintaining mountain gorilla populations.\n\n\"It's a total conservation win, and there aren't that many of them,\" said Gilardi.", "The International Olympic Committee made a statement following the results of last night's plebiscite where 56.4 per cent of Calgarians voted against the city hosting the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\n\"The IOC takes note of the decision regarding the candidature of Calgary for the Olympic Winter Games 2026,\" a spokesperson for the IOC said.\n\n\"It comes as no surprise following the political discussions and uncertainties right up until the last few days.\"\n\nCalgarians vote against bid to host 2026 Winter Olympics:\n\nThe No side won with 56.4 per cent of the vote, a total of 304,774 people cast ballots across the city. 3:43\n\nThe IOC acknowledged the individuals and organizations that were involved in trying to bring the Winter Games back to Calgary for the first time in 38 years.\n\n\"We understand the disappointment of all those involved in the candidature, especially the Calgary 2026 Committee, the Canadian athletes, who have so enthusiastically been a driving force behind this project, as well as the representatives of the business community, the Paralympic Movement and the members of the First Nations who fought so hard for the Olympic project.\"\n\nThere was a serious final push by many of Canada's Olympians in the days leading up to the plebiscite.

The most recent situation she's heard about was from 2017.\n\nShe said she's heard from at least two women reporting incidents in Manitoba.\n\n\"There may be more reporting that they were sterilized without proper and informed consent, against their will, in Winnipeg.\"\n\nThe most recent Manitoba incident happened in 2009, she said.\n\nThe women in Manitoba were all from Indigenous communities outside Winnipeg, Lombard said.\n\nThe women allege they were coerced into tubal ligations \u2014 the severing, burning or tying of the Fallopian tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus \u2014 during or after childbirth, or while seeking reproductive health services.\n\nIn many cases, the women were in labour, about to go under anesthetic for a caesarean section or already under anesthesia, Lombard said. She's heard of a case where the procedure was already in process when a health professional suggested tubal ligation to the mother.\n\n\"I think that the problem is quite a bit larger than we know it to be,\" Lombard said.\n\n\"And I think that it's quite a bit larger than we may, perhaps, ever know it to be, because not all women will come out and say that this happened to them.\"\n\nTubal ligations carried out on unwilling Indigenous women are among the 'most heinous' practices in health care happening across Canada, says Yvonne Boyer, a Metis lawyer and former nurse who is now a senator for Ontario. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nLombard did not rule out the possibility legal action would expand to include women in provinces other than Saskatchewan.\n\n\"I think there's always the possibility and perhaps even a likelihood,\" she said.\n\nA spokesperson for Manitoba Health said the department is not aware of any reports of forced sterilization.\n\nA spokesperson for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority declined to comment Tuesday because there are no formal allegations against the health authority at this time.\n\nSenator wants national study\n\nThe practice of coercive sterilization of Indigenous women has been ongoing since the 1930s, Lombard said. A federal investigation was done in the 1970s, she added, and the subject made headlines again starting in 2015.\n\nOn Monday, Ontario Sen. Yvonne Boyer said she'd like the Senate to do a national study of the issue.\n\n\"If it's happened in Saskatoon, it has happened in Regina, it's happened in Winnipeg, it's happened where there's a high population of Indigenous women,\" Boyer told the Canadian Press. \"I've had many women contact me from across the country and ask me for help.\"\n\nIn the proposed class-action suit in Saskatchewan, each woman is seeking $7 million in damages.\n\nLombard said the suit is also seeking specific legislative changes to end the practice and address the \"utter absence\" of preventative measures, including the criminalization of forced sterilization. Without that, the practice is punted into civil law, Lombard said, although some courts have held it constitutes sexual battery.\n\n\"We want to stop this from happening. Before you can really mend a wound, before you can heal, you have to ensure that the offence is no longer occurring,\" Lombard said. \"Or that at least preventative measures are put into place to ensure that its likelihood is extremely diminished.\"\n\nIn a written statement, federal Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott called coerced sterilization a serious violation of human rights.\n\n\"We know that Indigenous patients can face systemic barriers in accessing medical services, including discrimination and racism,\" the statement says.\n\n\"We all have a role to play to ensure that Indigenous patients receive quality health care free of prejudice, including ensuring medical professionals receive cultural safety training, as laid out in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to action.\"\n\nWith files from Sam Samson and The Canadian Press", "Dwane Casey makes his return to Toronto on Wednesday night as head coach of the Detroit Pistons. Casey spent the last seven seasons as Toronto's bench boss, but was fired this past May after the Raptors were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers for the second consecutive year.\n\nIn honour of Casey's return, here's a look back at the five most memorable homecomings in Raptors' franchise history.\n\nThe Good\n\nJose Calderon\n\nThe 6-foot-3 Spaniard recorded a franchise-record 3,770 assists over seven and a half years in Toronto. During the 2008-2009 season, Calderon shot 98.1 per cent from the free-throw line, setting a single season NBA record.\n\nThe point guard was traded to the Detroit Pistons in January 2013 in a three team deal that sent Rudy Gay to Toronto. Calderon was well-liked by Raptors fans, and received a standing ovation during his first game back in Toronto later that same season.\n\nAt halftime, Calderon started walking toward the locker room. The only problem was that it was the wrong locker room.\n\nCalderon finished the game with 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting as the Pistons beat the Raptors 108-98.\n\nMorris Peterson\n\nMo Pete, as he was affectionately known by Raptors fans, spent his first seven seasons in Toronto, playing in 371 consecutive games between 2002 and 2006.\n\nHe'll always be remembered in Toronto for an incredible game-tying three-pointer against the Washington Wizards in 2007.\n\nIn July 2007, Peterson agreed to a four-year, $23 million US contract with the New Orleans Hornets.\n\nThe Flint, Mich., native was cheered by fans in his return to Toronto on Mar. 30, 2008. Mo Pete even kissed the Air Canada Centre floor when he was introduced as part of the Hornets starting lineup.\n\nPeterson scored eight points in 24 minutes, including a pair of three-pointers as the Hornets beat the Raptors 118-111.\n\nThe Bad\n\nAntonio Davis\n\nAntonio Davis was acquired by Toronto in 1999, and played a major role in the Raptors' playoff runs between 2000 and 2002.\n\nThe Oakland, Calif., native drew the wrath of Raptors fans after a 2001 interview with Jim Rome, when he expressed concern about the type of education his children would receive in Canada. He even said he was worried about his kids learning the metric system.\n\nDavis was traded to the Chicago Bulls in December 2003. He played his first game back in Toronto in March 2004 and was loudly booed every time he touched the ball. Despite the crowd's reaction, Davis played well, scoring 18 points and collecting 14 rebounds as the Bulls beat the Raptors 96-91.\n\nChris Bosh\n\nChris Bosh was a five-time All Star (2006-2010) during his seven-year tenure in Toronto.\n\nBut all that starts well doesn't always end well.\n\nBosh suffered a facial fracture toward the end of the 2010 season with the Raptors battling for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. As a result, he missed the final five games of the year, and the Raptors finished the season a game back of the Chicago Bulls for the eighth seed.\n\nBosh joined the Miami Heat that summer in a sign-and-trade agreement. After his departure, Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo said that Bosh had 'checked out' the previous season. Bosh responded that he'd put his \"heart and soul\" into the Raptors organization.\n\nIn his first game back in Toronto in February 2011, Raptors fans booed Bosh every time he touched the ball, as well as when the camera panned over his face during the national anthem.\n\nBosh scored 25 points on 7-for-16 shooting, going 11-for-12 from the free throw line. The Heat defeated the Raptors 103-95.\n\nFollowing the game, Bosh blew kisses to the crowd as he walked off the floor. When asked if this was a sarcastic gesture, he responded, 'What does sarcasm mean?'\n\nThe Ugly\n\nVince Carter\n\nDuring their first three years in existence, the Toronto Raptors sported a miserable record of 67-179. Then, in the summer of 1998, the Raptors acquired Vince Carter in a draft-day trade.\n\nThe Florida native immediately made the Raptors a formidable opponent. Carter won the Rookie of the Year award in 1999, and led the Raptors to their first playoff series victory against the New York Knicks in 2001.\n\nBut the relationship between Carter and the team soured over the next few years.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Carter publicly requested a trade. In December 2004, he was dealt to the New Jersey Nets.\n\nMany fans believed that Carter didn't put forth his best effort during his final season in Toronto.\n\nThe numbers seemed to corroborate that assertion.\n\nIn 20 games with the Raptors to begin the 2004-2005 campaign, Carter averaged 15.9 points a game while shooting 41.1 per cent from the floor, and 32.2 per cent from three-point range. In 57 games with the Nets that season, Carter averaged 27.5 points a game, while shooting 46 per cent from the floor, and 42.5 per cent from beyond the arc.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, a report surfaced that he'd told the Seattle Supersonics a play the Raptors were about to run while he was still a member of the team.\n\nIn April 2005, Carter made his long awaited return to Toronto. It wasn't pretty.\n\nRaptors fans booed Carter mercilessly, heckling him during warm-ups, the national anthem, the lineup introduction, and every time he touched the ball. Additional security guards were placed by the Nets bench in order to protect Carter.\n\nDespite the chaos around him, Carter dominated, scoring 39 points on 15-for-26 shooting as the Nets beat Toronto 101-90.\n\nOver the next few years, the North Carolina alumnus was loudly heckled every time he returned to Toronto. The hostility directed toward Carter reached its apex in during a 2007 first round playoff series between the Raptors and Nets.\n\nIn 2014, Raptors fans finally showed their appreciation for Carter, cheering him as he received a tribute video as part of the team's 20-year anniversary celebrations. The tribute clearly struck a chord with Carter, as he could be seen tearing up while watching the tribute.\n\nWatch Vince Carter's emotional reaction to his tribute video", "The Manitoba government has closed down part of a bridge in south Winnipeg after cracks showed up in the deck concrete.\n\nThe westbound curb lane of the Red River Bridge, along the South Perimeter Highway, is blocked to traffic for further inspection.\n\n\"A detailed inspection and assessment of the lane is being conducted to determine the necessary repairs and a timeframe for reopening,\" states a news release from Manitoba Infrastructure.", "After two delays of Ottawa's $2.1-billion LRT system, there's still no firm date for when the city will get the keys, or when the public will ride those rails.\n\nIn a verbal update to the finance and economic development committee Wednesday, transportation services general manager John Manconi re-itererated his earlier estimate that the LRT would be up and running sometime in the first three months of 2019.\n\nHowever, there does appear to have been some significant progress on the system. According to Manconi, Rideau Transit Group (RTG), the consortium building the east-west Confederation Line, has met some key milestones:\n\nOn Tuesday, six trains made 55 successful end-to-end trips along the 12.5-kilometre route, from Blair to Tunney's stations.\n\nStations east of downtown \u2014 uOttawa, Lees, Hurdman, Tremblay, St. Laurent, Cyrville and Blair \u2014 are essentially complete.\n\nTrains have been able to run at their maximum 83 km/h, although they won't operate at that speed.\n\nFare gates and vending machines have been installed.\n\nAs well, RTG is going to launch a \"practice plan\" later this month \u2014 essentially, running the system with a full fleet.\n\nRTG is not contractually obligated to run the practice plan, which would be added to the 12-day testing period that is part of the contract.\n\nMayor still 'confident'\n\nMayor Jim Watson told reporters that he had \"great confidence\" that the LRT would be up and running by the end of the first quarter of 2019.\n\n\"When we finally saw the train run from one end to the other, with the right speeds and the right times for loading and unloading people, it tells me we're coming very very close to having full service by the 31st of March, 2019,\" said Watson, who tweeted a video of a test run.\n\nAll aboard Ottawa's LRT train!

It's unclear whether that lost revenue can be recouped from RTG, which is in theory responsible for any delay-related costs.\n\nBut Manconi said that while the city may go after RTG for certain costs, there's no guarantee the consortium will agree to the city's demands. Even a $1-million penalty for missing the Nov. 2 deadline may be up for dispute, according to the OC Transpo boss.", "Fort McMurray residents still struggling to rebuild and return home after the 2016 wildfire will get $2 million in financial assistance from the local municipality.\n\nThe Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo council approved the relief funding during a regular public meeting Tuesday.\n\nThe new funding will match $2 million earmarked by the Canadian Red Cross, and $2 million provided by the Alberta government, for a combined commitment of $6 million.\n\nThe funds will help cover the costs of interim housing and special assessment fees for homeowners who still have not returned home.\n\n'Heartbreaking' stories\n\nMore than two years since the wildfire devastated the city, many residents \u2014 including owners of Hillview Park, a condo project entangled in lawsuits \u2014 are still struggling to rebuild, Wood Buffalo Mayor Don Scott said.\n\n\"The fire is not over, it is still affecting lives in this region,\" Scott told CBC Tuesday.\n\nThe municipality has been holding public information sessions on an as-needed basis since the fire to hear people's concerns and answer their questions.\n\nIn a recent session Scott said he heard from many people who are struggling, saying it's not limited to the Hillview situation.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking just hearing the stories about how people were having difficulties,\" Scott said.\n\n\"I'm hopeful and optimistic that these funds will be used to alleviate some of the heartache that's been going on in this region.\"\n\nWhile the Red Cross has not used up all of the funds previously earmarked for recovery, Scott said the additional money is to ensure \"there is enough to meet these new circumstances.\"\n\nThe $6 million in relief funding will be distributed through the Canadian Red Cross.\n\nThe money cannot be used for legal fees, Scott said. How it will be disbursed is up to the discretion of the Red Cross, he added.\n\nEach case will be assessed according to unmet needs, not loss, stated a news release issued Tuesday evening.

Lieberman had demanded a far stronger Israeli response to the most intense round of rocket fire against Israel since a 50-day war in 2014, but he appeared to have been overruled by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHis resignation delivers a major blow to Netanyahu's coalition government and sparked immediate calls for early elections. Lieberman said he hoped that in the coming days a date would be set for a new vote. The opposition parties joined his call.\n\nThe government could technically survive without Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu faction. But with elections currently set for November 2019, it's unlikely to last that long in lame-duck form.\n\nLieberman's resignation will take effect in 48 hours and Netanyahu will take over on an interim basis.\n\nResidents of southern Israel had greeted news of the ceasefire with anger as dozens of protesters in the rocket-battered town of Sderot chanted \"Disgrace!\" at what they saw as the government's capitulation to violence and its inability to provide them with safety.\n\nRecent months have seen sporadic rocket attacks as well as militant infiltration attempts and a wave of incendiary kites that have destroyed Israeli crops.\n\nPM defends decision\n\nNetanyahu presented the decision to step back from a full-blown conflict as a unified one made by his security cabinet and based on the military's recommendations.

(Khalil Hamra/Associated Press)\n\nThe two sides had appeared to be on the verge of their fourth war in a decade. Instead, Gaza's Hamas rulers abruptly announced a ceasefire and Israel's Security Cabinet ended a seven-hour discussion with an apparent decision to hold its fire.\n\nThe news was greeted with celebrations in Gaza, with Hamas declaring victory in the latest round of violence, which was triggered by a botched Israeli raid on Sunday that left seven Palestinian militants and a senior Israeli military officer dead.\n\nRecurring border protests\n\nHamas has staged near-weekly border protests since March in an effort to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after the Islamic militant group seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade has ravaged Gaza's economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand rejected by the militant group, which is pledged to Israel's destruction.\n\nDemonstrators each week have approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops. The Associated Press says Israeli snipers have killed about 170 people, most of them unarmed. Reuters says Israeli troops have killed around 220 Palestinians.\n\nIsrael says it is defending its border against attackers, but it has come under heavy international criticism for shooting unarmed people.\n\nBefore Sunday's raid, Egyptian and UN mediators had made progress in reducing tensions. In recent days, Israel had allowed fuel shipments to increase the power supply in Gaza, which suffers from frequent blackouts, and agreed to additional Qatari assistance to allow Hamas to pay the salaries of its thousands of government workers.\n\nThe standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence in recent years, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli towns and cities and punishing Israeli military offensives, but Hamas remains firmly in control.\n\n\"We are third-class citizens here in Sderot and the communities on the border with Gaza,\" complained David Maimon, a local resident. \"It's a shame.

Leading up to this plebiscite, bid organizers had hoped for a Yes vote somewhere in the mid-50s, closer to 60 per cent support if things went well.\n\nThey didn't come close. The results were decisive: 132,832 for Calgary hosting (43.6 per cent) and 171,750 against (56.4 per cent). The official result will be made available at 3 p.m. MT on Friday, with results by riding posted Thursday at noon.\n\nAfter asking voters for guidance, Calgary's council will likely formally halt the city's bidding process at a meeting on Monday.\n\nThe No side won with 56.4 per cent of the vote, a total of 304,774 people cast ballots across the city. 3:43\n\nWhen Calgary initially announced plans to pursue the 2026 Winter Olympics, it all seemed so perfect. Calgary would recapture the Olympic spirit and excitement that enveloped and boosted the city when it hosted the 1988 Winter Games.\n\nBut for many, this bid never felt like 1988. Whatever the magical feeling was 30 years ago, it never captured voters. And now, Calgary's nascent Olympic bid has finally lurched to an unceremonious end.\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nThose behind Calgary 2026 did a lot of things right. They engaged and mobilized a cross-section of supportive voices. They attempted to showcase the Games as opportunity to revitalize and refurbish the physical legacy of 1988. Organizers also pointed to a successful bid as a needed economic lifeline for a city whose economy has been crippled by falling oil prices.\n\nWrong event at the wrong time\n\nBut as this process evolved, so too did an opposition that grew more mobilized and vocal as decision day approached. With far less money at their disposal than the professional bid committee, a web of critics appear to have effectively delivered their message that this was the wrong event at the wrong time for Calgary.\n\nAnd from an outside perspective, beyond the boosterism of those connected to the Olympic movement, there never seemed to be an overwhelming amount of genuine excitement among everyday Calgarians.\n\nPerhaps that could have been overcome. Most of the concerns surrounding this bid centred on who would pay for the Games. But voters either didn't like or couldn't understand the numbers they were given. Even on the floor of Calgary city council, leading up to this vote, there was confusion about exactly how much each level of government would provide.\n\nVoters were promised this information before being asked to decide whether they wanted an Olympics.\n\n\"What is the number we can take to the citizens of the city of Calgary?\" Coun. Jeremy Farkas asked.\n\nJudging by the results, the 11th-hour funding agreement by the city, the Alberta government and Ottawa, weeks before this vote, provided Calgarians little clarity or confidence.\n\nPast Olympic failures loomed large\n\nThis bid also undeniably fell victim to the unpleasant baggage weighing down the Olympic movement. The cynical narrative is familiar by now. Cities spend billions more than initially proposed to host a two-week party that leaves little long-term positive economic impact.\n\nRobert Livingstone operates the website GamesBids.com and has followed this process closely. He says people are increasingly wise about past Olympic failures.\n\n\"It's so ingrained and people perceive that the Olympic culture is corrupt, often real corruption in some cases. They have seen this big build and the overspend.\"\n\nLivingstone points out the International Olympic Committee has taken steps to mitigate this perception among Calgary voters.\n\nIn the past, the IOC has rarely interacted or visited with potential host cities. But with fewer cities lining up to host the Olympics, the IOC has resorted to actively selling the Games. Its representatives visited Calgary numerous times in recent months, attending town halls and doing rounds of media interviews.\n\nLivingstone also says the IOC, as part of its Agenda 2020, has taken steps to make the Games easier to bid on and cheaper to host. For example, in past Games, the IOC usually insisted on new buildings, often with little long-term practical use for host cities. But Calgary's bid focused on the IOC-supported idea of mostly refurbishing old facilities instead of building new ones.\n\nAgenda 2020 never resonated in Calgary\n\nThe lean bid model may work to counter the Olympic bid narrative, Livingstone says, but it may have actually made a potential bid less attractive for Calgary voters.\n\n\"I think Agenda 2020 is a total disconnect in Calgary,\" Livingstone says. \"Agenda 2020 didn't make sense because in Calgary, they want the venues. They wouldn't stop talking about the NHL arena and how they were going to get at it and the rail link to the airport. But because of Agenda 2020, it was left off [and] not included.\"\n\nSo what now for the 2026 Winter Olympics \u2014 the Games that nobody seems to want?\n\nWhen this process began, there were eight hopeful cities. Only two remain: Stockholm, and a joint Italian bid. And both of those bids face significant internal political hurdles.\n\nLivingstone thinks there could be another host lurking in the background.\n\n\"I really think that the IOC is hoping that Stockholm and Italy just go away and then they can work with Salt Lake City.\"\n\nThe American city, like Calgary, also has an Olympic legacy, having hosted the Games in 2002. Livingstone says the difference in Utah is a genuine enthusiasm to do it again.\n\n\"As they say themselves, they can get this done tomorrow [with] 89 per cent public support. They have the Utah governor already signing off on it. They did a feasibility study, and literally they could host the Games next year.\"\n\nFor many in Calgary, it seems that's just fine.\n\nCalgary, along with the rest of the country, will undoubtedly enjoy the 2026 Winter Olympics wherever they eventually land.\n\nWe will continue to celebrate medals and Canadian achievement, content to let somebody else foot the bill.", "A pair of 17-year-olds have been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the death of another 17-year-old whose body was found in a wooded area on Nuns' Island on Monday.\n\nThe accused, a boy and a girl, appeared in youth court in Montreal this afternoon.

Both sides say they hope to have a new deal in place by the end of 2020, so the backstop is never needed.\n\n\"The choices before us were difficult, particularly in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop,\" May admitted after the cabinet meeting.\n\nAmong the deal's other key points:\n\nTransition period: Britain will leave the EU on March 29 but remain inside the bloc's single market and bound by its rules until the end of December 2020, while the two sides work out a new trade relationship. The transition period can be extended by joint agreement before July 1, 2020 if both parties decide more time is needed.\n\nCitizens' Rights: EU citizens living in Britain, and Britons elsewhere in the bloc, will continue to have the rights to live and work that they do now.\n\nA political declaration: Stating that Britain and the EU will seek a \"free trade area combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation,\" and \"ambitious, comprehensive and balanced\" arrangements for the services sector.

(Stefan Rousseau/Pool via reuters)\n\nScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday that the deal was bad for the Scottish economy, adding that parliamentary approval would be difficult to win.\n\n\"It is obvious that [May] can barely unite her cabinet on this deal, and it is also increasingly clear that she will struggle to get a majority for it in Parliament,\" she said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"If this deal is indeed rejected by Parliament, then the U.K. government must return to the negotiating table to secure a better one.\"\n\nMay told lawmakers in weekly question period earlier in the day that the deal means Britain will \"take back control\" of its laws and borders \"while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of our United Kingdom.\"\n\n\"The cabinet will decide on the next steps in the national interest. I'm confident that this takes us significantly closer to delivering what the British people voted for in the referendum,\" May told Parliament.\n\n'A decisive step'\n\nThe ultimate outcome for the United Kingdom remains uncertain: scenarios range from a calm divorce to rejection of May's deal, potentially sinking her premiership and leaving the bloc with no agreement, or another referendum.\n\nThe hours-long meeting led to heightened speculation in the British media, including the possibility of a ministerial resignation or even a leadership challenge to May, which would require at least 48 of 315 Conservative MPs signing off.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier called the draft deal \"a decisive step toward concluding this negotiation\" and signalled that EU leaders can convene a summit soon to endorse it.\n\nBarnier told reporters Wednesday, \"I consider that we have achieved 'decisive progress\"' \u2014 the announcement that EU leaders had been awaiting from him to call a summit.\n\nBarnier didn't directly address the summit or its possible date, although Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that a leaders' meeting is penciled in for Nov. 25.\n\nAnti-Brexit demonstrators protest outside Parliament on Wednesday.

The Leave vote comprised 51.9 per cent of voters in 2016.\n\n\"We will not rerun the referendum, we will not renege on the decision of the British people,\" she told Parliament.\n\n\"We will deliver Brexit and the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union on the 29th of March 2019,\" she added.\n\nMay said that in the post-Brexit landscape, Britain will be able to strike independent trade deals with countries around the world, but she will need to convince at least some members of other parties.\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), whose seats have helped keep May's government in power, said it would not back any deal that treated the British province differently from the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"If she decides to go against all of that, then there will be consequences,\" DUP leader Arlene Foster said.\n\n'Bungled negotiations'\n\nIan Blackburn, MP from the Scottish National Party, called May \"hamstrung, divided, desperate and looking defeated.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn told the British Parliament the deal follows two years of \"bungled negotiations\" and that May is putting a false choice before MPs, between \"her botched deal or no deal.\"\n\n\"It breaches the prime minister's own red lines,\" he said. \"It doesn't deliver a strong economic deal that supports jobs and industry, and we know they haven't prepared seriously for 'no deal'.\"\n\nThe divorce also needs to be approved by the EU and European Parliaments, while Ireland's Leo Varadkar has promised his own Parliament a vote on the draft deal.\n\nVaradkar told Irish lawmakers on Wednesday that \"we are close\" to \"a legally binding and legally operable withdrawal agreement.\" But he says nothing is guaranteed, and a lot of things can still go wrong.\n\nConservative lawmakers opposed to May since at least when she unveiled her so-called Chequers plan will have to weigh the implications of defeating the deal. The consequences could include May's departure as leader, and a national election they could very well lose to Labour.\n\nA no-deal Brexit would also pitch the world's fifth largest economy into the unknown during a time Western countries are already grappling with the unconventional U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China.\n\nWith files from CBC and The Associated Press", "Natalie Lim from Vancouver, B.C. has won the 2018 CBC Poetry Prize for Arrhythmia, a poem about language, family and losing a part of yourself.\n\nAs the grand prize winner, Lim will receive $6,000 from the Canada Council for the Arts and a writing residency at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity.

The Alberta government, under Hoffman, exempted Covenant from having to provide access to those services.\n\nCovenant Health's enforcement of its policy has led to increased suffering for patients simply trying to exercise their legal right to an assisted death.\n\nIn 2016, Bob Hergott, a 72-year-old ALS patient who was effectively paralyzed, had to sign his form requesting an assisted death in a bus shelter across the street from his Covenant Health hospital.\n\nAnother ALS patient, 66-year-old Doreen Nowicki, was forced to have her assisted-dying assessment on an Edmonton sidewalk in May 2017 after Covenant suddenly withdrew permission for her to have it by her palliative bed.\n\nIn July 2016, an AHS doctor complained in an email to Hoffman about how one rural patient nearly bled out and died after Covenant Health initially prevented him from accessing assisted-dying services.\n\nNo excuse for inaction, critics say\n\nThe doctor asked Hoffman why Covenant Health, a publicly funded health provider, was allowed to discriminate against patients seeking assisted-dying services.\n\n\n\n\"Is this the type of care that Canadians and Albertans expect and deserve? Where is the dignity for this patient?\" the doctor asked her.\n\nIn her response, Hoffman gave no indication she was prepared to act on the issue.\n\n\n\nIn an emailed statement, the minister told CBC News the doctor subsequently discussed concerns with AHS' lead on the MAID program and that AHS then updated its MAID Guide \"to support better discussions with Covenant Health.\"\n\n\n\nBradley Peter, an Edmonton director of Dying with Dignity Canada, said Hoffman's response was inadequate.\n\n\n\n\"Now that we find out that actually, for two years, this policy has been harming patients, their families, and even the care providers, there is really no excuse at this point as to why this hasn't been dealt with yet,\" Peter said.\n\n\n\nDying with Dignity Canada called for Hoffman and her government to \"immediately rectify\" the situation and end Covenant's policy of forced transfers, including for the assisted-dying procedure itself.\n\n\n\n\"Not a single (other) Albertan should be forced to leave a publicly funded health-care facility to access their human right of medical aid in dying,\" Peter said.\n\n\"This is the 21st century\"\n\nIn response to a CBC News' investigation, Covenant Health said it is reviewing its policy to \"clarify\" its language around the \"exceptional\" cases where patients are allowed to sign MAID forms and have assessments in its facilities. Hoffman told CBC News she is monitoring that review and will create her own policy if she is not satisfied with Covenant's new one.\n\nThat response is not good enough, said Swann, who intends to raise the issue in a private meeting with Hoffman.\n\n\"It's time for the health minister to step up,\" Swann said.\n\n\"This is the 21st century. We have a new law in Canada. And all hospitals that are publicly funded should be following the same standard of care and access to services.\"\n\nPeter said he was relieved to learn health-care providers, like the doctor who complained to Hoffman in 2016, had voiced concerns about Covenant Health's policy.\n\nBut he is disappointed by the health minister's inaction so far.\n\n\"For two years, I have kind of been wondering, 'Where are the health-care providers in these institutions? Why aren't they speaking out? Why aren't they making a scene and pushing back against this policy?'\" Peter said.\n\n\"And now I realize, well, in fact they have actually been speaking directly to the health minister, and still nothing has been happening,\" he continued. \"So that is actually really troubling to me.\"\n\nIf you have information about this issue, please contact us in confidence at cbcinvestigates@cbc.ca.\n\n\n\n@jennierussell_", "The University of Ottawa plans to hold a referendum next year on who will represent students, potentially replacing the group plagued by concerns about how it manages money.\n\nAfter fraud allegations emerged this summer, the university suspended transfer payments to the Student Federation of Ottawa (SFUO).\n\nIn September the university announced it would not recognize the SFUO as the official voice for students after the end of this semester.\n\nAt the time, there were allegations that student funds has been misappropriated for personal expenses.\n\nSeveral contracts also went to family members of student executives.\n\n\u200bAudit done, but university isn't satisfied\n\nThe university asked the student federation to conduct a forensic audit, then president Rizki Rachiq stepped down from his post.\n\nThe SFUO released the results of that audit on Nov. 7, saying it showed the facts didn't support the fraud allegations, which were about money paid for catering services linked to relatives of SFUO staff that weren't actually provided.\n\nIn one case, the catering company wasn't actually hired and in the other, there were no issues with the catering or the approval of the contract under the federation's policies at the time, according to the SFUO.\n\nAuditors PricewaterhouseCoopers recommended the federation make a conflict of interest and procurement policy and appoint a full-time vice-president of finance who has an accounting background.

All-expense-paid trips. - eHealth Conflict of Interest policy\n\nIn a September statement, eHealth said the unnamed employees were dismissed because they \"attended sporting events in the United States paid for by private companies that provide goods and services to eHealth.\" eHealth also said the employees didn't break the law and no funds were misappropriated.\n\nCraddock wasn't fired. He had already left eHealth for a job at Sask Polytechnic, just weeks before the hammer came down on the other employees.\n\nCraddock said the new job opportunity was attractive because, \"I no longer felt comfortable in the political dynamic that was the consolidation of the health system and some of the fighting that was going on between organizations.\"\n\nPGA trip not just about golf\n\nAccording to Craddock's Twitter account, he decided to follow Saskatchewan's Graham DaLaet around the Quail Hollow course in Charlotte. The PGA championship is one of four major tournaments on the PGA Tour.\n\nFormer eHealth executive Wilbour Craddock says he went to the 2017 PGA Championship at the expense of Lexmark, a company doing business with the Saskatchewan government.\n\nCraddock, described on his Twitter profile as a \"mad golfer\" who wears shorts 365 days a year, said the event was not just about golf.\n\n\"You also were obligated to participate in product overviews, have conversations with product specialists,\" he said. \"I met with the health care lead out of Seattle who looks after Lexmark's business. I met with the Canadian area vice president and had meaningful conversations around what Lexmark could do and what Lexmark wasn't doing to support our needs in Saskatchewan.\"\n\nCraddock said the original contract with Lexmark was signed by someone else before Craddock was at eHealth. He acknowledges he was pushing eHealth to deepen its business relationship with Lexmark.\n\n\"We had a provincial agreement in place and we were looking at ways to optimize, absolutely,\" he said. \"We were looking to take advantage of a pre-existing relationship.\"\n\nConflict contradictions\n\neHealth's conflict of interest policy at the time explicitly forbade just this sort of trip for employees.\n\nThe policy provided \"examples of gifts that should be declined:\n\nGifts or entertainment that could influence or appear to influence, business decisions.\n\nFlights and/or registration to events.\n\nAll-expense-paid trips.\"\n\nThat policy is likely what got Craddock's eHealth colleagues fired. However it appears to have had little influence on some of Craddock's travel decisions during his four-year tenure at eHealth.\n\nVendor-sponsored travel relatively common at eHealth\n\nCraddock estimated he took about two vendor-sponsored trips per year to locations like Las Vegas, Orlando and Austin.\n\n\"It's not always looked at as a free trip. In some cases, these are taking us away from our families, taking us away from our jobs, to continue to promote the work that we're doing,\" he said.\n\nI know for a fact that the Lexmark trip that I went on, a prior approval wasn't completed, so I violated policy on that particular instance. - Wilbour Craddock, former Chief Information Officer at eHealth\n\nHe noted that besides that trip to the PGA Championship, he never received free tickets to a sporting event.\n\nAccording to eHealth policy, employees taking out-of-province trips were required to get a \"prior approval\" form filled out in advance of the trip.\n\nCraddock acknowledges that he failed to get CEO approval for the PGA Championship trip to North Carolina.\n\n\"I know for a fact that the Lexmark trip that I went on, a prior approval wasn't completed, so I violated policy on that particular instance,\" he told CBC's iTeam in an interview.\n\n'Prior approval' after-the-fact\n\nCBC submitted a freedom of information request for all of Craddock's travel records.\n\nThe PGA trip didn't show up in the records at all, but dozens of other trips did.\n\nIn six cases, Craddock got his \"prior approval\" form signed by the CEO after he returned from the trip. He told CBC he would have had verbal prior approval, though he didn't fill out the paperwork.\n\nIn several cases, eHealth's CEO Susan Antosh approved Wilbour Craddock's \"prior approval\" form after he returned from travel. (eHealth freedom of information request)\n\nHe said it's \"an administrative shortcoming not an approval shortcoming.\" He said in some cases, the paperwork wasn't filled out because the trips were last minute.\n\nCraddock said there were lots of cases where his travel was paid for by taxpayers. That was the norm, he said. Craddock said when he took vendor-paid trips they were always approved by the CEO, except for the PGA trip.\n\n\"It was a standing principle that where possible we would leverage vendor supported funding to attend conferences and different national or international meetings,\" said Craddock. \"And that was not exclusive to me or to people in my division. That was more broadly within the organization and was, I guess, led by our CEO at the time.\"\n\nThat CEO, Susan Antosh, was removed from her role in October 2017 and was assigned as a special advisor to the deputy minister of health. She was dismissed from that role in March 2018. No explanation has been offered for her departure.\n\nLate 2017 and early 2018 was a tumultuous time at eHealth. On January 24, 2018 the entire board was replaced with one exception. Some members had resigned while others' terms had expired.\n\nIn the legislature in May, Minister Jim Reiter said eHealth is getting set to take on responsibility for all IT for the entire province, \"so it just seemed that it was an appropriate time for a bit of a change of direction.\"\n\nDuring the turmoil, the organization was run by interim CEOs.\n\nThe NDP's Danielle Chartier raised concern about all the turnover saying \"the organization, with all due respect, seems not entirely stable at this point in time.\"\n\nReiter replied, \"I would say, you know, your concerns are valid.\"\n\nWhen the NDP opposition raised questions about the significant turnover at eHealth's board and in the CEO position, Minister of Health Jim Reiter replied \"your concerns are valid.\" (CBC)\n\nWhen CBC asked eHealth about Craddock's travel history, the Crown corporation said in an email Craddock is no longer with the organization.\n\nThe spokesperson also noted \"eHealth has undergone significant renewal over the past 9 months including the appointment of a new Board of Directors and the hiring of a new Chief Executive Officer.\"\n\nIt also said it has recently enhanced its code of conduct processes and that, \"the Provincial Auditor is aware of the issue and is reviewing the matter.\"\n\nVendor-sponsored travel with health region employees\n\nCraddock said the vendor-sponsored trips were regularly discussed at weekly senior leadership meetings and no one ever expressed doubts about approving them.\n\nHe pointed to one example he said was discussed by the team in 2016. Dell reseller WBM was offering all-expenses paid trips to a conference in Austin, Texas, for Craddock and some eHealth staff.\n\nIn the meeting, Craddock said, it was noted that employees of the Saskatoon, Regina and Prairie North health divisions were also sending staff on the trip.\n\n\"So we discussed the fact that others from the health system were attending this. The offer was made to us and the decision was made that it would be best that we attended as well,\" said Craddock.\n\nWhile eHealth's policy forbids taking vendor-sponsored trips, the Saskatoon Health Region (SHR) policy says it's OK. It says staff may accept \"tokens exchanged as part of protocol/the normal exchange of hospitality between persons doing business together (including lunches and trips, meals, travel, accommodations paid by the vendor).\"\n\nIf I was to walk back in time would I do things maybe differently? Yeah possibly. - Wilbour Craddock\n\nIn an email from the new Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA), which has subsumed all health regions including Saskatoon, a spokesperson defended the SHR policy.\n\nIt said \"an employee taking a vendor-paid trip is not, in itself, considered to be a conflict of interest.\" It said such trips are permitted if they are for educational purposes and that trips are reviewed by management \"to ensure no conflict exists, and then to confirm safeguards are in place to deter any future related conflict of interest.\"\n\nA few days later, the SHA wrote CBC a follow-up email saying it \"agrees that the former regional health authority (Saskatoon) conflict of interest policies need to be revamped and strengthened into one clear, strong provincial conflict of interest policy. This process is underway.\"\n\nCraddock said that at eHealth, part of the justification for accepting the vendor's offer was that it saved taxpayers money.\n\n\"I think that was part of the underlying rationale as to why we leveraged vendor relationships when we did for conference participation,\" he said. \"It wasn't for every single conference.\"\n\neHealth featured in Dell promotional video\n\nCraddock said that because Saskatchewan was such a key account for Dell, the company asked eHealth if it would participate in a promotional video. It was written into the contract between the two entities he said.\n\nWilbour Craddock says as part of eHealth's contract with Dell, the crown corporation agreed to do some promotion of the company. 1:27\n\n\"The commitment was that if we took that on we would do some promotion material with them. So the creation of the video was one of the promotion items that we did. I spoke at a conference at a breakfast session for them. I spoke at another conference out in Vancouver at an evening session.\"\n\nIn the video, Craddock talks about one of the attractions of working with Dell and \"the value of the Federation End-User Computing Solution to their managed service delivery.\"\n\n\"We're looking for partners, not vendors,\" Craddock says in the video. \"We have a lot of vendors but the Federation, we're partnering with them because of the outcomes that we're trying to drive towards.\"\n\nCompanies offer trips to curry favour: expert\n\nMaureen Kilgour, who's an expert in business ethics and corruption, said the practices at eHealth and the Saskatoon Health Region are surprising and troubling.\n\nShe said a public entity agreeing to do a promotional video for a private company is \"sort of weird\" and problematic.\n\n\"You stop seeing the separation between the contractor and the contractee,\" said Kilgour. \"These public sector officials are supposed to be representing the public interest and we're seeing like blurring of the relationship between the people that we in the public would be engaging to provide services to us.\"\n\nMaureen Kilgour, an associate professor of business at the University of Winnipeg, said conflict of interest policy exists to protect the public and public employees. (CBC)\n\nShe said conflict of interest policies are in place to protect public sector employees and the public from corporations seeking undue influence through gifts.\n\n\"Companies offer these things for a reason - because it's part of their own cost of doing business. They're trying to curry favour, build relationships and that's really part of their marketing,\" she said.\n\n\"We know that influence matters right? That's why companies spend so much money on doing that.\"\n\nShe said she was \"shocked\" to see that the Saskatoon Health Region explicitly allows vendor paid trips.\n\nShe said the problem with these sorts of gifts is they don't promote transparency and are liable to abuse or, at the very least, suspicion.\n\n\"We would never know if there was some sort of favourable treatment because of these trips. That's why we always talk about perceived conflict of interest,\" she said.\n\nKilgour said she's not surprised to see that private companies are offering these sorts of trips - it's what they do. But she said politicians and bureaucrats should follow a higher standard.\n\n\"All of these policies are really there to prevent any influence on decision making in the public and really to avoid any risk or even a perceived conflict of interest perceived influence in procurement.\"\n\nRunning the public sector \"more like a business\"\n\nCraddock said attending the Dell conference in Austin made a lot of sense for people in the Saskatchewan health care system.\n\nHe said eHealth and the entire system were big Dell customers.\n\nCraddock sat in on a small group session with Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell and he learned what Dell was planning for the future. He said these sorts of interactions are valuable.\n\nIn 2016, Wilbour Craddock and his colleagues from Saskatchewan health regions attended a Dell Conference in Austin, Texas, courtesy of a private Dell reseller. (Twitter)\n\n\"People want to invest in you because they want to work with you. And they want to work with you because they understand what you're trying to achieve and you've had those meaningful conversations,\" he said.\n\nHe said these sorts of interactions are the norm in the private sector but acknowledged they can be controversial for public servants like himself.\n\n\"We're always challenged in the public sector to run more like a business,\" Craddock said. \"When you try to run like a business you can be seen in a negative light.\"\n\nEthics expert Kilgour said politicians and bureaucrats need to understand that standards of what is acceptable are different for people in the public and private sectors.\n\n\"It's completely different when the public sector is involved because there's another element of trust,\" she said. \"So even though they might have been naive, they might have been lulled into thinking they're in sort of more of a private kind of corporate environment \u2014 that company to company relationships are ok. But it's not because it is the public sector.\"\n\nCraddock said looking back at his travel practices does get him thinking.\n\n\"Does it give me pause to reflect on how best to work within the public sector? Yeah it does for sure. And if I was to walk back in time would I do things maybe differently? Yeah possibly.\"", "An Ottawa-based network that helped find private sponsors for 685 refugees across Canada with the backing of major philanthropists got a third of its sponsorship groups in Ottawa.\n\nCanada had 1,000 unclaimed spaces for privately sponsored refugees in early August when the Refugee Fund was launched.\n\nWhile the intention had been to fill all those spots, organizers are still claiming victory.\n\n\"If you go to the airport or you go to someone's home who has just arrived, you realize every single one of those numbers is a human being,\" said Emilie Coyle, a director at the University of Ottawa's Refugee Hub, which helped run the effort.\n\nIn just over a month, the Refugee Fund helped assemble more than 150 sponsorship groups across Canada.\n\nAbout a third of them, 52 groups, are based in Ottawa.\n\n\"We are so pleased that the Ottawa community came out in droves,\" Coyle said.\n\nShe said it wasn't a surprise given the strong response to the 2015 Syrian refugee resettlement and strong partnerships with local agencies.\n\nThe fund is distributing $3.5 million and started with donations from an American philanthropist, the Shapiro Foundation, and the Giustra Foundation based in Vancouver.\n\nOther donors later joined in to help cover the cost of privately sponsoring a refugee for a year.\n\nSponsors and the federal government split a year of income support for refugees in the program.\n\nHalf new sponsors\n\nThe cost of privately sponsoring a family of four is $18,100.\n\nCoyle said the fund helped encourage people who'd sponsored before to do so again and new sponsors to commit for the first time.\n\n\"It really gave that bump,\" Coyle said.\n\n\"About half of the people who applied to our fund were new, brand-new sponsors. That's really excellent for us because now we can work with them and hopefully they'll do it again and encourage their friends and family.\"\n\nMore than 600 refugees are coming to Canada by the end of the year thanks to a lot of first-time sponsors and donors who are covering up the cost.

(Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\nMoscoe said the group has divided up the work to make sure they commit to supporting the family for a year, but the most urgent need is housing.\n\n\"Once we get into the apartment, it's about setting it up as best we can, so the family has a great base from which to launch their new life in Canada,\" Moscoe said.\n\nMidia Shikh Hassan is messaging the group her family is sponsoring and says they are eager to come to Canada, though unsure what to expect.

We're a little bewildered. It really took us by surprise,\" Gideon Barker said on Tuesday.\n\nMcNugget is one of three chickens living in a four-by-four coop in Witless Bay. (Ariana Kelland/CBC)\n\nThe couple and their three chickens carefully decided to make Witless Bay home after researching which municipalities embraced homesteading.\n\nWitless Bay does allow for hobby farming under its bylaws. In fact, Barker said, there are two other chicken coops on their street.\n\nBarker said they applied to build a coop in June 2017, a time when the Witless Bay town council was in turmoil.\n\nIts mayor had resigned, council meetings went off the rails, and council matters weren't able to be dealt with because of a lack of members.\n\n\"The council was in disarray. They weren't sitting whatsoever. So, they weren't able to hold a quorum to be able to approve our permit,\" Barker said.\n\n\"We waited three full months and when the weather was beginning to change and our coop was still at our previous house that we had completely moved out of, we were pretty well pressured to bring our coop here.\"\n\nThe couple built the coop without the proper permit. Soon after, a new council was acclaimed.\n\nThis four by four chicken coop has become a point of contention in the small town of Witless Bay, a community 30 minutes outside of St. John's. (Ariana Kelland/CBC)\n\nOnce the coop-building began, the town received three complaints from the public over a possible increase in rodents due to the chickens, and concerns over possible water contamination.\n\n\"We, of course, at the following meeting contested this point and we argued it, saying that the whole point is a little ridiculous, considering we're talking about a couple chickens here,\" he said. \"We're not talking about some crazy farming operation. That seemed to have fallen on deaf ears.\"\n\nAppeal doesn't fly\n\nBarker believes all three complaints came from the same family. One of the addresses listed as home to a complainant is actually a vacant house nearby, Barker said.\n\nNeither Mayor Rene Estrada or Deputy Mayor Maureen Murphy responded to CBC's requests for an interview.\n\nLentil, Bean and McNugget lived in two properties in St. John's, including this one in the downtown area. St. John's allows residents to own three chickens. (Submitted by Gideon Barker)\n\nBarker and Humphries appealed to the Eastern Newfoundland Regional Appeals Board after the town denied their permit. The board's decision came back last week, upholding the town's denial.\n\nIn the decision, the board states the couple did not have a proper permit when they built the coop \u2014 and therefore, it must go.\n\nWe have also met some of the most backward-thinking individuals in our entire lives. - Gideon Barker\n\nBarker is frustrated by the decision, since he believes there was no way to get a permit from the tattered remains of the town council at the time the coop needed to be built.\n\nWhen asked if he would consider filing an application for a permit and starting the process all over again, Barker said he had little hope, given the opposition they've had so far.\n\n\"We were under the full impression that this would be just such a fantastic community to live in and to the credit of the people here, we have met some of the most amazing people in our entire lives in this community,\" he said.\n\n\"We have also met some of the most backward-thinking individuals in our entire lives. We just cannot comprehend why this is such an issue and yet, for this council, and for the couple people who we unfortunately live near, this is a big issue.\"\n\n'Not discouraging livestock'\n\nMeanwhile, the town is standing by its decision, saying the coop was built without a permit, on an undersized lot.\n\n\"The town did receive submissions from neighbours who opposed the application for the proposed chicken coop, council reviewed the submissions, and made a decision based on the concerns addressed within them,\" said a statement provided by Witless Bay town council Wednesday.\n\nThe council is adamant Witless Bay is not \"discouraging livestock,\" but it has to be operating within the rules.\n\nJaclyn Humphries feeds her three chickens at the controversial coop outside their home in Witless Bay. (Ariana Kelland/CBC)\n\n\"It is an unfortunate situation, not unlike others that municipal councillors have to deal [with] across the province on a daily basis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Barker said lot size did not come up when the town moved forward with the discretionary notice.\n\nHe said the issue should be able to be dealt with through compromise.\n\n\"Erecting the coop without a permit is an extremely flimsy excuse as we had made every attempt possible to get the permit while the council was not sitting,\" Barker said in a followup email.\n\n\"It appears this council does not want us to have these chickens and they are using every excuse they can find to deny us from having them.\"\n\nSubscribe to the St. John's Morning Show podcast\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "Weather\n\nToday will see sunny skies becoming a mix of sun and cloud near noon.\n\nThe high is 0 C, but feels like -10 C.\n\nTonight will be mainly cloudy with a low of -3 C \u2014 wind chill feels like -7 C.\n\nTraffic\n\nSeminole Street from Central Avenue to Chandler Road is reduced to one lane in each direction for watermain work.\n\nCurry Avenue from Northwood Street south to E.C.

But pharmaceutical analytics firm IQVIA says as of August 2018, zero prescriptions had been filled by those centres.\n\nMifegymiso is available free of charge and without a prescription at three locations in Manitoba, including the Women's Health Clinic in Winnipeg, where hundreds of people have accessed it. But clinic executive director Nadine Sookermany said the hope was it would make a difference for smaller communities.\n\n\"The numbers don't surprise me,\" she said. \"I guess it was my hope that there was more access through the market outside of the sites that currently are funded to dispense.\"\n\nMifegymiso \u2014 a two-drug combination that induces a medical termination of a pregnancy \u2014 can cost up to $300 if prescribed away from those locations.\n\nA provincial breakdown from IQVIA shows Manitoba retail pharmacies had not dispensed Mifegymiso by August 2018. The provincial government, however, says the drug was dispensed 29 times by community pharmacies as of June. (CBC)\n\nIn Saskatchewan, nearly 400 people have received the abortion pill over the counter, while more populated provinces with universal coverage such as Alberta (2,573) and Ontario (6,612) have dispensed the drug thousands of times, according to data obtained from Canadian retail pharmacies.\n\nSookermany argues Manitoba must do better than only offering the drug for free where surgical abortions are already permitted.\n\n\"We are seeing people being transported, finding their ways long distance into the city. We do know, anecdotally, that people are travelling both for medical and surgical abortion.\"\n\nOf the 1,566 abortions the clinic's performed so far in 2018, 53 procedures assisted patients from northern Manitoba, including as far north as Churchill.\n\nLast year, 70 women and girls from northern Manitoba visited the clinic for an abortion.\n\nTravelling far for Mifegymiso\n\n\"We have women come from as far as Thompson, The Pas, Flin Flon, Norway House, Swan River, so the north is really the area that is the most challenging,\" Sookermany said. \"The three sites that do offer abortions are in the southern part of the province.\"\n\nThe Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg and Brandon Regional Health Centre also provide the abortion pill for free.\n\nSo far, 20 people from northern Manitoba have made appointments for an abortion at Women's Health Clinic but not shown up. That number was 27 in 2017.\n\nSookermany was cautious to say why, but said they often hear of barriers for people in northern communities to make it down to Winnipeg for a procedure.\n\n\"I don't think we're the only site that sees people travelling from across the province. It is the only option for many.\"\n\nUnwilling, unable to prescribe\n\nBarret Procyshyn, president of Pharmacists Manitoba, said the limited number of Mifegymiso prescriptions being dispensed by his colleagues demonstrates a problem.\n\nThe issues are numerous, he said: physicians may not have the training, or may be unwilling to prescribe it because of their personal beliefs on the procedure, or the price of the drug.\n\nA pharmacist needs to see a prescription before it dispenses Mifegymiso.\n\n\"Medication coverage often dictates how much it's used,\" Procyshyn said. \"Not everyone has approximately $300 in funds sitting around to do it.\"\n\nHe said the drug has been dispensed a number of times since August in Dauphin, where he works, after a physician trained to prescribe the drug was in place.\n\nMifegymiso is a combination of two drugs that can terminate a pregnancy of up to nine weeks. It was approved for use in Canada in 2015. The cost per dosage is about $300. (Linepharma International)\n\nOutside the three clinics where surgical abortions are performed, the drug is not free in Manitoba. While it has become an eligible benefit under Pharmacare, those patients would still have to pay out of pocket unless they've met their Pharmacare deductible for the year or are on Employment and Income Assistance.\n\nSheila Dunn, a family doctor from Toronto, understands if rural physicians are hesitant.\n\n\"If I was a physician or a prescriber out in a small community and I really had not done that and have patients who might need an abortion, have to pay for the drug, then I might use my old methods of referring people to abortion, which might mean that they have to travel,\" she said.\n\nIn Manitoba, the province is satisfied with the status quo.\n\nThey've reviewed Mifegymiso funding and access twice this year, and has not received any complaints or concerns about access from clinicians, health regions or the public, said a government spokesperson in an email.\n\nThe province has resolved to monitor access to the drug going forward.\n\n\"Manitoba's approach allows abortion centres to offer options to women and ensures coverage for low-income women,\" the statement said.\n\nAs of June, 558 women have received fully funded access to Mifeygmiso since it became available in 2017. The pill has been given to 293 individuals at the Women's Health Clinic, 238 people at HSC and 27 people at Brandon's hospital for free.\n\nPurpose lost on government: NDP\n\nThe opposition NDP argues the province does not grasp the fundamental purpose of Mifeygmiso, if it isn't readily available in the rural, remote communities the drug is supposed to be accessible for.\n\n\"The government's approach literally cancels out why the abortion pill is such a game-changer, by offering it at current locations,\" status of women critic Nahanni Fontaine said.\n\nShe added the government is also failing to inform women and girls of the drug's availability.\n\nOtherwise, some women are forced to go out of their way.\n\nIf \"I think I have to leave my community, I have to hop on a plane, everybody knows why I'm leaving my community, everybody knows why I'm going to come back,\" Fontaine said. \"I suggest to you that many women will not go through that because there's so many barriers.\"\n\nSookermany doesn't want Manitoba to be the last holdout that isn't providing the prescription medicine for all. Only Saskatchewan has not offered or committed to offering universal coverage, said Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights.\n\n\"I think there needs to be political will around this issue and not be afraid to talk about reproductive rights and women's options around choice. I think that's the hesitancy,\" Sookermany said. \"I don't think they're seeing this as a health issue, they're seeing this as a women's health issue.\"\n\nWith files from Kelly Malone", "In mid-November 1968, a team of cardiologists at St. Michael's Hospital received a call they had been waiting on for months.\n\nAn 18-year-old man had been badly injured in an accident, they learned. He was ruled brain dead, but his heart was still beating.\n\nIt was a tragedy that set into motion the first successful heart transplant in Canadian history, which marks its 50th anniversary on Saturday.\n\n\"We never had any hesitation,\" said Dr. John K. Wilson, now 93. \"We were ready. The team was ready.\"\n\nA year earlier, in 1967, Wilson had identified a potential recipient for a heart transplant, Charles Perrin Johnston, who had been suffering from heart failure and appeared headed toward an early death.\n\n\"I told him at the time, almost facetiously, 'Hey, maybe we can give you a new heart in a year's time,'\" Wilson remembers telling Perrin Johnston.\n\nCharles Perrin Johnston lived for six years after receiving a new heart in 1968. At the time of his death, no transplant recipient had lived longer. (St. Michael's Hospital)\n\nThe golden age of cardiology\n\nIn December 1967, the South African doctor Christiaan Barnard performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant \u2014 an earlier transplant had been attempted using a chimpanzee heart \u2014 though the recipient lived for just 18 days after the surgery.\n\nIn Canada, several hospitals were jockeying to become the first to replicate the operation, though early attempts were met with fast deaths or incapacitated patients.\n\nIn May of 1968, Albert Murphy became the first Canadian to receive a new heart, though he died within hours of the operation, performed at the Montreal Heart Institute.\n\nIn the following months, Toronto General and Toronto Western hospitals also attempted heart transplants, though none of the patients recovered.\n\nIn the wake of multiple failures and amidst a growing media frenzy around the race between the three Toronto hospitals, the team at St. Michael's took their shot at the potentially life-saving operation on Nov. 17, 1968.\n\nThe transplant was to be performed by Dr. Clare Baker, with Wilson providing support during Perrin Johnston's recovery.\n\nDr. Clare Baker was the surgeon who carried out the operation. Baker died in 2010. (St. Michael's Hospital)\n\n\"We had to have confidence. And if anybody gave the image of being a confident performer, a confident surgeon, a capable surgeon, it was Dr. Clare Baker,\" Wilson remembered about his colleague, who died in 2010.\n\nThat confidence and preparation ultimately translated into a successful surgery.\n\n\"He left the operating room like any other patient, with a beating heart,\" Wilson said.\n\nPerrin Johnston went on to live six years with his new heart. At the time of his death, he was the longest lived male heart transplant recipient in the world.\n\nWhen doctors later asked him how they did it, \"maybe we said more prayers at St. Michael's Hospital,\" Wilson would say with a laugh.\n\nSurgery inspired future doctors\n\nShortly after Perrin Johnston's transplant, Dr. Robert Chisholm arrived at St. Michael's as a medical student. He says the experience of watching Dr. Wilson and Dr. Baker during their breakthrough years altered the course of his career.\n\n\"That two month experienced changed my life,\" said Chisholm, who started his tenure at St. Mike's without a medical specialty. He has now worked as a cardiologist at the hospital since the 1970s.\n\n\"It was a very exciting time because the world was kind of watching us,\" he added. \"We had pretty good success in those early days.\"\n\nDr. Robert Chisholm worked with Dr. John K. Wilson and Dr. Clare Baker as a student in the late 1960s. The experience inspired him to pursue a speciality in cardiology. (Martin Trainor/CBC)\n\nWhile the techniques used in cardiology have advanced considerably since the 1960s, Chisholm says the approach taken by Wilson and Baker should serve as a powerful lesson to their modern contemporaries.\n\n\"The key to their success, I think, was judgment,\" he said. \"And that still applies today.\"\n\nFailed surgeries following breakthrough\n\nFollowing Perrin Johnston's surgery, Baker, Wilson and the St. Michael's cardiology team travelled around the world, sharing their findings at medical conferences filled with doctors still struggling to perform the operation.\n\nIn total, Wilson and the team carried out five heart transplants at St. Michael's, though the last two were unsuccessful.\n\nThey stopped performing transplants after those failures, due to advancements in other areas of cardiology and a need for anti-rejection medications that were not yet developed.\n\nStill, Wilson looks back fondly on his years at the cutting edge of the specialty, knowing that his team's success informed the work of doctors around the world, and elevated the profile of his hospital as a result.\n\n\"We were pretty proud that we were able to present a successful transplant,\" he said. \"We showed that it can be done.\"\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, 170 Canadians received heart transplants in 2015.", "Elections NB is using geo-targeted ads on Facebook in the hopes of garnering more nominations for upcoming municipal byelections.\n\nThe ads on the social media site appear in the 23 communities where byelections will be held Dec. 10 to fill 31 vacancies.\n\nKimberly Poffenroth, the province's chief electoral officer, said the agency spent between $1,200 and $1,400 on the ads.\n\n\"It's a very low-cost campaign,\" Poffenroth said. \"And we're hoping not only that people will see the Facebook ads, but then share them, like them and pass it on to family and friends that live in the areas where we have vacancies.\"\n\nKim Poffenroth, the province's chief electoral officer, said the ad campaign is a low-cost method to increase awareness of the byelections.

And anyone who was either having trouble finding a doctor that supported it, or was shy about it \u2014 essentially it's out there now, direct access,\" said Adam Gibson, the group's director of policy.\n\nNatural health products have labelling that spells out what the supplement can be used to treat, how much of the active ingredient each tablet contains, as well as a list of any non-medicinal ingredients. (CBC) But since official sellers such as the OCS are designed for recreational pot users, its products don't include the CBD labelling information medical marijuana patients need, Long told CBC.\n\n\"There's no information on the packages about usage or dosage or warning statements \u2014 anything like that.\"\n\nThe result, Long and Gibson say, is people experimenting with different products and different dosages that could lead to harmful interactions if taken without a doctor's supervision.\n\n'Dangerous precedent'\n\nPeter Thurley, a medical marijuana advocate who sits on the board of directors for Canadians for Fair Access to Medical Marijuana, is concerned about drawing too close a comparison between CBD and natural health products.\n\n\"Things that are vitamins, we've got a pretty good idea. We've research those to death, if you will,\" said Thurley. \"We're not in that same space at all with CBD and so I would certainly hesitate in creating a space in the market for CBD products without any kind of education or medical supervision. I think that's a dangerous precedent to set.\"\n\nHealth Canada appears to agree with Thurley. When recreational use of cannabis was legalized, Health Canada added phytocannabinoids, including CBD, to its prescription drug list.\n\nIn a statement to CBC, the federal department said this was done to \"maintain the requirement for oversight by a health care practitioner for therapeutic products and to help ensure that these products are used appropriately, just like any other prescription medication.\"\n\nIt says this will ensure any health claims made by cannabis-containing products are \"properly regulated.\" Health Canada went on to say there just is not enough clinical evidence to develop \"acceptable threshold dosages for non-prescription use.\"\n\nBut if CBD was regulated as a natural health product, says Gibson, it would be subjected to strict testing and guidelines \u2014 something he knows intimately, having worked in the health product food branch at Health Canada for 14 years.\n\nLimited clinical evidence\n\nHe says the regulation of Canada's natural health products is robust, among the best in the world.\n\n\"You have to provide evidence of safety, efficacy \u2014 it has to do what it says it does \u2014 and quality before it's approved,\" explained Gibson.\n\n\"Then after it's approved you also have monitoring for adverse drug reactions, there's requirements to report that, and that gets put into a common system so you can monitor for drug-drug interactions, and develop that really robust system around health products.\"\n\n\"We have something that's kind of skirting the whole system right now.\"\n\nFor its part, Health Canada said the decision over how a drug is classified as prescription or not is evaluated according to risk.\n\n\"Right now, the level of evidence around the safety and effectiveness of specific doses of the active ingredients in cannabis are limited,\" it said.\n\n\"This type of information would be essential to establishing dosage limits or other thresholds to differentiate between prescription and non-prescription products,\" said Health Canada.\n\n\"We anticipate that this type of information will become available over time, as scientific evidence grows.\"", "As workplace harassment allegations surface on social media against Winnipeg restaurant chain Stella's, a Winnipeg human resource professional says many employees in similar situations don't know where to turn if they have concerns about their workplace.\n\n\"I think more people, more employees, are knowing what their rights are \u2014 but maybe aren't exactly sure in terms of what's the best course of action,\" said Diana Wiesenthal, who runs Winnipeg-based human resources firm Corporate People Responsibility.\n\nIt's important for employees and employers alike to know how to deal with issues at work, she said.\n\n\"Workplaces can make people sick.

He was taken to the trauma centre at Sunnybrook Hospital, where he later died of his wounds.\n\nPolice did not have information about possible suspects and could not say whether Brhanu was shot while inside the vehicle or if he got into it after.\n\nCarbone said evidence suggests Brhanu was the intended victim.\n\n\"The appeal here today is to speak to witnesses who have an untainted version of what they saw,\" he said.\n\nHomicide detectives and forensic investigators were at the scene early Wednesday. Police also used canine units to help canvass the area around the scene, said Toronto police Det.-Sgt.

In 2015, there were 47. Their ranks are shrinking as some drivers quit or are let go by taxi companies for poor performance.\n\nTerry Morier is one of only 18 accessible-cab drivers left in the city. He said the work is gratifying, but the accessible cab system needs to be fixed. (Dave Laughlin/CBC)\n\nThe problem boils down to supply and demand, dollars and cents, and a few unwilling drivers, according to veteran driver Terry Morier, who still gets behind the wheel of one of the few remaining accessible taxis.\n\nHe said the accessible-taxi system is \"not working.\" Wheelchair-accessible vans are more expensive to buy, must be modified to CSA taxi standard and cost more to operate.\n\nThe calls from passengers with disabilities are sporadic and come from across the municipality \u2014 for fares that are sometimes just a few dollars. The result, Morier said, is some drivers don't bother with those calls.\n\nOn Oct. 24, Wendy had catheter surgery at the Victoria General hospital site. It took much longer than expected, and she wasn't settled in her hospital bed until around 8:30 p.m.\n\nHer husband, who also uses a wheelchair, made a promise that left him in a predicament.\n\n\"I can't leave until I find out what's going on with my wife, and the other part is how I'm going to get home,\" said Guy.\n\nWhen he called for an accessible cab, there weren't any, and he was running out of medication. Fortunately, a nurse turned a chair into a makeshift bed for Guy, and a doctor wrote him a prescription he filled at the pharmacy in the hospital.\n\nThe day after the surgery, Wendy was well enough to go home. The couple went by Access-A-Bus, the city's paratransit service, because she had correctly guessed her discharge time when she booked it the previous week. The service requires seven-day advance booking.\n\nWendy White shows her log of calls attempting to get a cab or bus to take her to the hospital. She called 311 to complain when she was unsuccessful. (Elizabeth Chiu/CBC)\n\nTaxi woes cropped up again several days later. Wendy's VON nurse discovered pus seeping from her wound, and her doctor wanted her back at the hospital the next morning.\n\nWendy called the city's two main cab companies, two drivers directly and a private transportation service. But none were available. She also phoned Access-A-Bus. She was told 45 people were ahead of her.\n\nGuy urged Wendy to call 911 for an ambulance, but she refused. Cost was a factor for a couple living on a disability pension. Plus, Wendy said she didn't want to take paramedics from more critical calls.\n\nSo, she motored 300 metres to the bus stop, caught a Halifax Transit bus equipped to lower to curb height, and then navigated around a construction zone near the hospital to have her infected wound checked.\n\nShe wanted to take a cab back home, but her go-to driver had a broken transmission. So, she got herself on another bus.\n\n\"I was extra cautious over any bumps, anything that might dislodge my tubing or my drainage or my catheter or undo stitches,\" she said.\n\nMorier has logged nearly 570,000 kilometres in six years on his wheelchair-accessible taxi. (Dave Laughlin/CBC)\n\nMorier said the couple's situation is \"pretty desperate.\" He's one of the dwindling number of accessible taxi drivers sticking it out. Six years ago, one of his regular clients became paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and asked him to consider accessible-taxi work.\n\nMorier answered the call and invested $70,000 in a van that can accommodate up to two small-power wheelchairs. He works 12 hours a day, or longer, and his van has logged nearly 570,000 kilometres in six years.\n\nHe must accept dispatched calls from Dartmouth, Lower Sackville, Bedford or even further for potentially only a $5 fare.\n\nHe said he would \"go broke\" serving only accessible clients because the calls are infrequent, are from passengers who can take longer to serve, and are spread out over the large municipality \u2014 using more gas and time.\n\nSo, Morier works on a system of pre-booked calls from his 1,500 clients \u2014 114 are in wheelchairs \u2014 while also accepting dispatched calls and fares off the street.\n\nHe said his clients with disabilities are satisfied even though they know \"there are times they just cannot get me, even my regulars.\"\n\nCalling out cabbies\n\nBrian Herman, a co-owner of Casino Taxi, the city's largest taxi dispatch company, said it had 35 accessible taxi drivers at its peak in 2015-16. But now there are only five.\n\nHe said about 20 drivers have quit, while the company \"parted ways\" with about 10 who repeatedly refused calls from people with disabilities \u2014 a violation of Casino's policy.\n\nHerman said the problem is that accessible calls are more costly than conventional fares and cabbies wind up losing money. There are higher expenses, it takes longer to load and unload passengers, and the fares are often smaller.\n\nHe said to increase on-demand availability, the solution lies with the government to provide a subsidy of about $10 or $15 to taxi drivers to compensate for fares that are otherwise money-losing.\n\nMorier believes there are enough accessible-taxi drivers to serve the city's disabled community \u2014 if all of them were doing their jobs properly. The availability issues, he said, won't be easily fixed without incentives to drivers to fulfil their duties.\n\nHe recalls when the province used to offer a grant to modify taxis into accessible vehicles. The province spent nearly $200,000 converting 11 cabs. But in 2013, funding was shifted to not-for-profit community transit groups.\n\nDespite all the challenges, Morier said the gratitude from customers with disabilities keeps him behind the wheel.\n\n\"It makes it worthwhile for me,\" he said.\n\nGerry Post is the executive director of the Nova Scotia's Accessibility Directorate. (Dave Laughlin/CBC)\n\nGerry Post, the executive director of Nova Scotia's Accessibility Directorate, which is charged with implementing the Accessibility Act, said the story of Wendy and Guy White is sad, unfair and raises a health issue. He regularly hears from people in similar predicaments.\n\nBased on 2014 data, Post calculates the cost to the Halifax Regional Municipality for an Access-A-Bus trip is $37, compared to $14.50 for the same trip by accessible taxi.\n\nHe said if the municipality were to supplement Access-A-Bus with accessible taxis, it would double the number of paratransit trips under the same budget and get more accessible taxis on the road by outsourcing to the taxi industry. Post said similar models exist in other Canadian cities such as Toronto.\n\nThe municipality is spending $3.9 million to add 10 new accessible buses and replace 21 in its Access-A-Bus fleet of 40 vehicles over the next three years.\n\nIt has also tried to increase the number of accessible cabs by not limiting their numbers \u2014 unlike conventional cabs, which are capped at 1,000.\n\nA consultant hired by the city has reviewed the city's taxi industry \u2014 including accessibility. A survey was also conducted to gather thoughts from residents, however none of the questions specifically pertained to accessibility.

He had a fatal mixture of methadone and benzodiazepine, according to autopsy findings reported by the Canadian Press. Cromwell was not in the methadone program, which administers liquid doses to help inmates curb their opioid addiction.\n\nTestimony of drugs\n\nA corrections investigation report dated July 22, 2014, details how Cromwell appeared groggy on video footage the night before his death.\n\nHis bunkmate said Cromwell had been gurgling in his sleep between 11:30 p.m. and 2 a.m. and that he rolled him over on his side. At breakfast time, the inmate called for help when he noticed Cromwell wasn't moving.\n\nThe same report discloses that Cromwell's wing was on lockdown since the previous day, and correctional officers were aware inmates had been \"all pilled up.\"\n\nClayton Cromwell had only been in the Burnside jail for a few weeks when he died from an overdose. His mother is suing the province. She alleges the jail failed to prevent the flow of potentially dangerous drugs.

She alleges the jail failed to set up sufficient safeguards to prevent the flow of potentially dangerous drugs.\n\nThe Department of Justice declined comment, citing the ongoing lawsuit.\n\nAccess to methadone\n\nJustice and health officials have previously told CBC they believed Cromwell had taken methadone that was \"cheeked\" by another inmate. That's when someone either conceals methadone during intake or throws it up and sells the filtered liquid.\n\nThe Nova Scotia Health Authority said as a result, it changed the jail's methadone policy to hold inmates for 30 minutes after they received methadone, rather than 20 minutes.\n\nAn internal memo dated Sept. 9, 2014, shows the 30-minute time limit was in fact the requirement before Cromwell's death, and staff did not adhere to the policy the day before he died \u2014 not even close.\n\n\"Offenders were held between 3 and 18 minutes in a secure vestibule not the required 30 minutes after taking methadone,\" the memo states.\n\nSearch protocol\n\nIn the same memo, Sean Kelly, director of correctional services, focuses on inadequate searches within the Central Nova Correctional Facility.\n\n\"A review of search records conducted for a one month period prior to the death in custody shows the quality of searches does not meet acceptable performance standards with respect to being thorough, systematic, and appropriately documented,\" Kelly writes.\n\nHe ordered the superintendent to \"undertake a review of area and person searches conducted at the facility\" and to \"strengthen practices.\"\n\nHalifax lawyer Devin Maxwell represents Clayton Cromwell's mother.

One staff member described the intercoms as a \"nuisance.\"\n\nInmates explained how they yelled to the person inside the barrier-free cell \u2014 a cell designed for people with physical disabilities \u2014 but that button also didn't work.\n\nAs a result, inmates resorted to waving their arms through food slots and yelling to get the attention of correctional officers.\n\nIn his memo, Kelly says \"there was no documentation to explain why the intercom was disabled.\"\n\nIn addition, he said supervisory approval wasn't sought, offenders weren't told the intercoms were disabled and the buttons didn't work for \"a period beyond 24 hours.\"\n\nKelly asked for barrier-free cells in living areas to be included in the regular audit of intercoms. There was no directive for other cells to have intercoms turned back on.\n\nUnion reaction\n\nPresident Jason MacLean of the Nova Scotia Government & General Employees Union (NSGEU), which represents correctional officers at provincial jails, said it makes sense to have intercoms in barrier-free cells, but otherwise agrees they are an unnecessary annoyance.\n\nA former jail guard, MacLean also points out that correctional officers do not have the authority to disable intercoms.\n\n\"This has been an issue ever since Central Nova Correctional Facility opened up, and actually it's been such a nuisance and hindrance of getting work done in the other facilities that intercoms weren't part of the plan,\" he said.\n\n\"So if you look at Northeast Nova, there are no intercoms. Why? Because intercoms were being abused.\"\n\nJason MacLean is the president of the union that represents provincial corrections workers. (CBC)\n\nMacLean said chronic understaffing at the Burnside jail, paired with the presence of street drugs, creates an unsafe environment for correctional officers. However, he adds the recent addition of body scanners has made a difference finding contraband.\n\n\"That's been a huge help. There's been a lot of packages found and everything else. It makes it a safer place,\" said MacLean.\n\n'Veil of secrecy'\n\nEven though some progress has been made since Cromwell's death four years ago, Maxwell can't understand why the province continues to limit information. He says that has been the biggest frustration for Cromwell's family.\n\n\"The province's approach to Clayton's death and conditions in the jail in general has been a difficult thing,\" Maxwell said.\n\n\"You know their efforts to keep a veil of secrecy over as much of this as possible, whether it's with us, whether it's with the media, whether it's with the general public has been a frustrating thing to watch for them.\"\n\nThe Canadian Press fought for access to internal reports relating to Cromwell's death and were denied.

But the machine recount is showing the race is much tighter than first thought and so it's likely to push the process to its next stage \u2014 a hand recount.\n\nAndrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida, trails his Republican rival, Ron DeSantis, by more than 30,000 votes.

And it is those rules that have determined Nelson's shot is close enough to be taken seriously.\n\nSo the effect of both Scott's and Nelson's tactics, as well as the media questioning whether Nelson even has a chance, is to undermine public confidence in the fairness of the election.\n\nTrump revives 2016 tactic\n\nAnd that, again, is to say nothing of the president's behaviour, so let's get to that.\n\nTrump has not only tweeted \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 that many ballots in Florida are missing or forged, he has also called for the recount to stop and for Scott to be declared the winner.\n\n\"An honest vote count is no longer possible,\" he claimed with utter disregard for the millions of voters who might think otherwise and for the military servicemen and women whose votes are still to be counted.\n\nThe Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected.

The cabinet then issued the order.\n\nIt's not clear whether the new PC government will introduce legislation to end the moratorium.\n\nThe Liberal-imposed moratorium was at a cabinet order, meaning it could be repealed by cabinet, according to a Tory spokesperson.\n\n\"Technically speaking, the 2015 moratorium was imposed through a regulation of cabinet which could be repealed by cabinet,\" spokesperson Jean Bertin said in a written statement.\n\n\"However, government staff are investigating whether implementing regional resource development and outlining a mechanism for determining support would require amendments to legislation.\"\n\nAustin said whether legislation is required or not, the issue should still come to a vote.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said. \"With such a contentious issue like that, I think that all members should have a right to vote.\"\n\nAnd he said he is not sure how he'd vote, given the chance.\n\n\"I don't know.

In casino capitalism, he says, \"What goes up must come down.\"\n\nCertainly if shares were to continue their recent declines, all that money removed from government revenue and used to bid up stocks using share buybacks and dividend payments could simply disappear into thin air. Meanwhile, taxpayers will be left with a bigger national debt and increased calls for cuts to public spending to balance the budget.\n\nAs Keynes observed, the purpose of capitalist markets is not to make a fortune in a matter of weeks or months on stock speculation, but instead to raise money for wise and productive investment in the economy.\n\nNorth America has lost jobs because of high wage costs, but even in lower wage places such as China, companies are investing in automation technology. (Reuters)\n\nAnd that was exactly what was supposed to happen with the tax cuts.\n\nAs sold to the American public, giving the tech giants a tax break would encourage them to bring their money home from overseas tax shelters and allow them to invest in the U.S.\n\nInstead of making iPhones in China, for instance, Apple could spend the money on the research and the machinery to create North American jobs.\n\nWhile the U.S. might have had trouble competing on wages, even companies in China are automating their factories. According to President Donald Trump's MAGA rationale, there is no reason why those factories, the new technology to run them, and the high-paying jobs to make it all happen could not be located in the U.S. instead of China.\n\nIn fact, the name of the bill said it all. When the tax-cutting legislation was presented to Congress at the end of last year it was introduced as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nYet, despite the plunging U.S. unemployment rate, jobs continue to go abroad while investors get rich on speculation.\n\n'Good for shareholders'\n\nCalculations by the London Financial Times show that so far this year, five of the biggest U.S. technology companies, including Apple and Google parent Alphabet, spent a combined total of $115 billion buying back their own shares.\n\n\"Outlay on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/buybacks?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#buybacks</a> almost doubles, putting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/investors?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#investors</a> among biggest beneficiaries of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Trump</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tax?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tax</a> reforms\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FT</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zBbFrQQ3VW\">https://t.co/zBbFrQQ3VW</a> \u2014@don_pittis That's about double the amount those companies spent on share buybacks in the previous year, before Trump's tax cuts kicked in. And it represents only a fraction of the estimated $1 trillion US paid back to shareholders of tech and non-tech companies.\n\n\"Most companies are using cash to buy back stock and make acquisitions, rather than invest in new facilities,\" Allianz investment manager Walter Price told the Financial Times. \"I think this is good for shareholders and management.\"\n\nIn theory, the money that goes to buybacks could eventually return to the economy, and certainly some of it does. For example, shareholders might sell their stocks and spend the money on restaurant meals, recirculating the cash into the economy. Or they could take the money and use it to hire people for a startup business.\n\nFailure to invest in the future\n\nBut according to Rochon, in a \"financialized\" economy neither of those things tend to happen. The very rich who own most of the stock don't circulate much of their wealth into the real economy. And when they sell shares, rather than investing in something entrepreneurial, they tend to use the money to buy some other financial investment in hope of further speculative returns.\n\nRochon says short-termism compounds the problem. Rather than waiting for a long-term investment to pay off at five to seven per cent a year, shareholders and managers \u2014 who are paid bonuses tied to their stock price \u2014 want to see shares rise now. Share buybacks solve that dilemma.\n\nThis photo from the New York Stock Exchange in 1947 shows bulletin clerk Dolores Hennessy changing bid and ask prices. By then, the market had begun to recover from the so-called casino capitalism of the 1920s and '30s.

Failure by the private sector to invest in new U.S. technology, new U.S. plants, new robots and new jobs will mean the U.S. will find it harder to compete with global challengers, including China.\n\nAnd any of the buyback money that disappears as share prices fall might just as well have been left in the public purse to invest in things like infrastructure and health care and education for the poorest \u2014 things that really could make America great again.\n\nFollow Don on Twitter @don_pittis", "Prince Charles has been predestined for one job since the age of three \u2014 and he's had plenty of time to think about the way he'll shape the role.\n\nThe heir to the throne turns 70 on Wednesday, still waiting to be king, although no one except him can say for sure what kind of monarch he will be.\n\nBut the Prince of Wales has left plenty of clues about what is important to him.

The Crown must prove the accused's driving was \"a marked departure from the manner in which a reasonably prudent person would drive under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe Crown must present evidence of a pattern of dangerous driving leading to the collision, not just a momentary lapse in attention.\n\nOn Nov. 2, Deinsberg St-Hilaire, 39, was found not guilty of dangerous driving causing death and leaving the scene. (Matthew Kupfer/CBC)\n\nThat principle was established In 2008, when the Supreme Court made a landmark ruling on dangerous driving causing death.\n\nThe case involved Justin Ronald Beatty, who drove into oncoming traffic on a clear, sunny day, killing three occupants of another vehicle. Beatty later reasoned he must have lost consciousness due to heat stroke.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the trial judge's acquittal, arguing Beatty's momentary lapse of attention didn't qualify as dangerous driving because a reasonable person in the same situation could not have acted to prevent the harm.\n\nReferred to 2008 case\n\nIn her decision, Aitken referred to that 2008 case, ruling there was reasonable doubt of a marked departure of behaviour on St-Hilaire's part.\n\nAitkin also noted the lack of eyewitnesses or traffic cameras showing St-Hilaire's driving was erratic. Instead, she accepted his testimony that he'd fallen asleep at the wheel, was awoken by a bang and had no other indication that he'd hit a cyclist.\n\n\"Despite the horrible and tragic consequences of this case I am left with a reasonable doubt as to whether Mr. St-Hilaire's brief period of lapsed attention \u2014 possibly only a few seconds \u2014 was sufficient to find criminal liability for dangerous driving,\" Aitkin concluded.\n\nI think it's become part of the law we feel we can turn a blind eye to. - Patrick Brown, Bike Law Canada\n\nThe decision disturbed civil litigator Patrick Brown of Bike Law Canada, a group that advocates for legal reform to prevent cyclists from being injured and killed.\n\n\"At the end of the day, most people would perceive staying up all night and speeding like that as a marked departure from what a normal person would do,\" Brown said.\n\nAitken did acknowledge that St-Hilaire was driving 30 km/h over the speed limit, but reasoned that was normal behaviour given the hour and relatively remote location.\n\nBut Brown believes the ruling speaks to a wider problem.\n\n\"It's concerning that to be 30 kilometres over the speed limit seems to be something we're considering an acceptable standard,\" he said. \"It's a car culture, and I think it's become part of the law we feel we can turn a blind eye to.\"\n\n'A pure accident'\n\nCriminal defence lawyer James Foord wouldn't comment on the specifics of the St-Hilaire case, but acknowledged the tremendous pain the ruling has caused the Nevin family.\n\n\"Sometimes it's just a pure accident, and that's not a lot of solace to someone who has lost someone. But reasonable doubt is the golden thread that keeps our justice system integral,\" he said.\n\nThe family of a hit and run victim says it's a 'disgrace' that the accused driver was acquitted despite admitting falling asleep behind the wheel. C-B-C reporter Laurie Fagan has been looking into this. 7:33\n\nDespite his acquittal on the two charges, St-Hilaire still faces serious consequences: he pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice, a charge that could earn him up to 10 years in prison.\n\nHe's scheduled back in court in January to set a sentencing date.\n\nThe Crown has not indicated to CBC whether it plans to appeal St-Hilaire's acquittal.", "Brace yourselves for the coldest day of the season so far.\n\nDespite the sunshine, temperatures will be running way below normal on Wednesday.\n\nA normal high would be 5 C and we will be about 10 degrees shy of that.\n\nThe last time the high temperature didn't get higher than -5 C was on St. Patrick's Day.\n\nThe wind will pick up again, gusting near 40 km/h out of the west, so bundle up.\n\nThe wind chill will make it feel like -18 at its worst and -12 in the day.\n\nThe deep freeze prompted a special weather statement for much of western Quebec where wind chills could make it feel like \u201330 and also make roads slick.\n\nThe forecasted low up in Maniwaki is -9 C with a -23 wind chill.\n\nAnother bright and chilly day lies ahead for Thursday then snow is likely to start that night through Friday.\n\nFollow along with the latest on Twitter.", "A prominent U.S. senator turned to genetic testing last month to try to prove her claim that she had Indigenous ancestry.\n\nBut in assessing Elizabeth Warren's DNA, the geneticists were forced to use samples from Mexico, Peru and Colombia because there were no samples from American Indigenous peoples in the reference databases.\n\nBecause the data is missing, Indigenous geneticists Krystal Tsosie of Vanderbilt University and Matthew Anderson of Ohio State University argue that Warren's test results, which showed Native American ancestry six to 10 generations ago, are a reach.\n\nMany more researchers have joined the discussion regarding Warren's DNA test results, weighing in on the problems inherent in using genetic databases to unearth Indigenous ancestry.\n\nIndigenous data is missing because \"Native American groups within the U.S. have not chosen to participate in recent population genetic studies,\" wrote Carlos Bustamante, the geneticist studying Warren's DNA. That information gap for Indigenous groups exists around the world, including Canada.\n\n\"The Warren news was a distraction from the real work,\" said Laura Arbour, one of the lead scientists for the Silent Genome project recently funded by Genome Canada and Genome British Columbia.\n\nArbour and her colleagues are trying to develop strategies to better engage Indigenous communities in genomic research.\n\nShe describes a growing \"genomic divide\" as the disparity between the genomic information available for people with a European background and the information available for Indigenous people.\n\nPrecision medicine\n\nBridging this \"genomic divide\" will allow Indigenous people to benefit from a future with precision medicine, says Arbour.\n\nThe term precision medicine refers to the use of genomic data to predict which drug will work best for each person.\n\nBut precision medicine cannot serve Indigenous people if their reference data is missing.\n\nThe lack of representation of Indigenous genomes in large databases reflects a general wariness in that group caused in part by historical cases of genetic research gone wrong.\n\nOne study considered by leading geneticists including Roderick McInnes, former institute director in the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, as a game changer involved the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations on Vancouver Island.\n\nThe Nuu-chah-nulth have a high frequency of rheumatoid arthritis. The research team collected DNA samples from approximately half of the First Nations members to study the genetic basis for the disorder.\n\nThe genetic determinants of rheumatoid arthritis weren't found, but that wasn't the big problem. Researchers sent the DNA samples to external facilities for genetic ancestry studies without the knowledge or consent of the participants.\n\nThat action created concern around privacy and possible exploitation through the use of the genetic data for commercial gain, Tsosie and Anderson wrote in a piece posted on The Conversation.\n\nPositive relationships\n\nOn the other hand, there are examples of positive relationships between Indigenous groups and non-Indigenous genetic researchers.\n\nMembers of the Gitxsan nation in British Columbia, for instance, told Arbour and her colleagues about the high prevalence of sudden cardiac death in their community.\n\nThe Gitxsan not only initiated the research into the genetic cause for this disease but also helped supervise the work through advisory and governance committees.\n\nWhen geneticists were assessing U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA, they had to use samples from Mexico, Peru and Colombia because there were no samples from American Indigenous peoples in the reference databases. (Charles Krupa/Associated Press)\n\nWith that co-operative relationship, the research team found the genetic basis for the prevalence of Long QT syndrome, which can cause sudden cardiac death, in the Gitxsan. A gene mutation was found to be responsible for disrupting normal cardiac rhythm. The Gitxsan could then be effectively treated for Long QT syndrome after that discovery.\n\nArbour also sees a need to customize the practices for DNA collection in Indigenous communities so that they maintain control.\n\nOne little-known aspect about most genetic testing projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project or 23andMe, is that they, not the donor, retain ownership of the sample.\n\nIndigenous leaders don't want this to happen in studies of their people.\n\nDNA obtained from an Indigenous individual should be considered \"on loan\" to the researcher just for the purpose of the specific research project, says Arbour. Ownership of the sample should be retained by the individual with the future potential to be stored in a \"tribal-controlled DNA bank,\" she says.\n\nCalls for Indigenous leadership\n\nIndigenous leaders have long recognized the need for Indigenous scientists to take ownership of the research conducted with their DNA.\n\nWriting in the Hill Times last month, Natan Obed, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, a national, non-profiit organization representing 60,000 Inuit, said that \"Inuit are the most researched people in the world \u2014 yet with colonial approaches to research \u2026 our role is imagined as marginal and of little value.\"\n\nHe also recently renewed his call for Inuit leadership in the three major Canadian research agencies: the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.\n\nLaura Arbour, one of the lead scientists for the Silent Genome project recently funded by Genome Canada and Genome British Columbia, and her colleagues are trying to develop strategies to better engage Indigenous communities in genomic research. (Brad Lyle, Genome BC)\n\nBuilding capacity for Indigenous leadership in genomic research takes time.\n\nBut real change could come through the work of programs like SING, which stands for the Summer Internship for Indigenous Peoples in Genomics.\n\nThis educational program initiated at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2011 and sponsored by multiple agencies including the National Institutes of Health was geared primarily for Indigenous students in a university undergraduate or graduate degree program in the U.S. but has since spread to Canada and New Zealand.\n\nThe SING workshops aim to give Indigenous students interested in genetic science additional skills and knowledge that would help them move into advisory and leadership roles within genetic research. The workshops of approximately 20 participants have been held annually at multiple U.S. university venues, most recently in Seattle earlier this year.\n\nKatrina Claw, a former SING participant and now a leader of the program in the U.S., says there have been participants from 44 First Nations, including mostly students who are interested in genomic, social and political sciences.\n\nThe SING training workshops include basic scientific methods in DNA sequencing and analysis along with tutorials on the principles of informed consent and ethics relating to DNA data sharing.\n\nFaculty positions\n\nThe Indigenous leader of SING Canada, Kim TallBear, an associate professor in the Faculty of Native Studies at the University of Alberta, says that genomics research must also be taught with the view of correcting the history of disciplinary mistakes made by scientists.\n\nA significant proportion of SING participants enter the program with a background in genomic science or the social and political sciences and with the intention of learning about Indigenous genomics from a \"bioethical and decolonizational perspective,\" said TallBear.\n\nThe goal of the SING workshops is starting to be realized. According to TallBear, Anderson is another great example of someone of Indigenous descent who started with SING as a graduate student, came up through the ranks to become an assistant professor and is already leading discussions around genomic research in Indigenous communities.", "A forester from Bancroft, Ont., says the province could be doing much more to deal with an insidious disease that's killing beech trees across Ontario.\n\nSvetlana Zeran called in to CBC's Ontario Today Monday to say beech bark disease is a major concern on the nearly 400,000 hectares of forest her company manages.\n\n\"We have been dealing with beech bark disease for about a decade,\" Zeran said. \"Now that it is here on the [Canadian] Shield, it is moving very rapidly and we are seeing the disease come in and infect the trees and they are dead within two to five years.\"\n\nThe disease begins when an insect bores holes in the bark, allowing a red fungus to invade the tree and slowly weaken it from the inside out.\n\nInvasive species is killing Ontario's beech trees. Forester says, province needs to do more to save them. Plus advice from Toronto Botanical Garden's Paul Zammit. 27:39\n\nInfecting young trees\n\nZeran said as mature trees die saplings rise in their place, but the young trees are also susceptible to the disease and crowd out other potential new growth.\n\nIt is a self-perpetuating cycle.

I call it the sort of zombie forest.\"\n\nZeran said her company would like support to go into the forest and removed dead or dying trees to potentially limit the spread of the disease. She said so far, the government has not been receptive.\n\n\"It's been a struggle just trying to get the funding to get the people to do the work,\" she said. \"I think it should be a priority to start removing it from the forest.\"\n\nNo way to halt disease, ministry says\n\nMinistry of Natural Resources and Forestry spokesperson Jolanta Kowalski said unfortunately, there really is no way to control the disease.\n\n\"There is no insecticide or fungicide that can be applied to kill the beech scale insect or the canker fungus. Such treatments are not practical in a forest setting anyway,\" she said in an email.\n\nKowalski said removing trees can help from a safety perspective, but it isn't a long-term solution to the problem.\n\n\"Removing trees that are diseased is a good idea from a safety standpoint, as they tend to break and fall over in wind storms, but it will not reduce disease levels in the forest.\"", "A Domino's Pizza franchise in Mississauga must pay a former delivery driver $28,144.54 in lost wages and other benefits for violating several parts of the Employment Standards Act, Ontario's Ministry of Labour has ruled.\n\nJuan Jose Lira Cervantes \u2014 a father of six \u2014 filed a claim in March arguing that for four years, he was doing the work of an employee but was being paid as an independent contractor making less than minimum wage.\n\nIn a decision dated Nov. 5, an employment standards officer\u200b with the Ministry of Labour ruled Cervantes was an employee entitled to minimum wage and other benefits.\n\n\"I was glad that they agreed with what I thought was right,\" Cervantes told CBC News.\n\n\"I always thought that the amount that I was being awarded is merely what I should have been paid all along. This is just money that I am owed.\"\n\nFirst I complained. Then I was fired. It didn't make sense. Because I had been working for them for four years. - Juan Jose Lira Cervantes\n\nUnder Ontario's labour law, independent contractors don't have the same protections as employees.\n\nThey set their own hours and use their own tools, but are not entitled to overtime or vacation pay. In contrast, employees are told when and how to do their work, but are entitled to the minimum wage and overtime pay.\n\nOf the $28,144.54 the company is being ordered to pay Cervantes, $17,539.60 was wages owed for getting below minimum wage.\n\nJuan Jose Lira Cervantes, shown with his eight-year-old son David Lira Pena, has been home since he was taken off the work schedule at Domino's Pizza in April. His wife is now working to support the family while he cares for the four children who still live at home. (Farrah Merali)\n\nThe Ministry of Labour ruling also found that since Cervantes was technically an employee, he was entitled to vacation pay, overtime pay, holiday pay and other benefits, and ordered the company to compensate him.\n\nCervantes also argued he was taken off the work schedule after his employer learned he filed the complaint.\n\n\"First I complained. Then I was fired. It didn't make sense, because I had been working for them for four years,\" said Cervantes.\n\n\"How come all of a sudden I was fired just after I made the complaint?\"\n\nThe ministry found that to be an act of reprisal and said Cervantes must be compensated for that.\n\nThough Cervantes began working for the company in 2013, he can only receive compensation for lost wages and benefits for the past two years. That's because under the Employment Standards Act, an employment standards officer can only issue an order for unpaid wages if the employee has filed a claim within two years of when the wages were due.\n\nOther franchises\n\nIt's not the first time a Domino's Pizza franchise in Ontario has been found in violation of the province's employment laws.\n\nIn February 2017, a worker in Guelph filed a similar claim with the Ministry of Labour, arguing he was doing the work of an employee but was being treated as an independent contractor.\n\nHe was making $5 an hour plus tips. He quit after one week of work.\n\nThe labour minister agreed he too was an employee, and ordered that franchise to compensate him for lost wages.\n\nSimone Ostrowski, with Whitten & Lublin Employment Lawyers, says she's not surprised to hear that even a company as large as Domino's is found to be committing these violations.\n\n\"Certainly in retail and restaurants, it's very common to see the independent contractor versus employee debate,\" said Ostrowski.\n\nToronto labour lawyer Simone Ostrowski said Cervantes's ruling from the Ministry of Labour could have ripple effects across the industry, with other delivery drivers who may be hired as independent contractors. (Farrah Merali)\n\n\"Unfortunately, there's a lot of workers out there in these types of contractor relationships that might not even know that the situation they're in is potentially illegal. And they might not know they have a recourse to complain to the ministry.\".\n\nBased on the arguments listed in the decision, Ostrowski said it's clear Cervantes was an employee and not a contractor, and that this ruling could have have an impact on the industry.\n\n\"I would say that this decision could have ripple effects, perhaps across the entire industry, with respect to delivery drivers who are paid as contractors because the principles are still the same,\" said Ostrowski.\n\n\"They can actually point to this decision and say, 'Look at how the ministry ruled in this case. I'm in a very similar circumstance and you should rule that I'm an employee as well.'\"\n\nCompany won't appeal ruling\n\nUnder ministry rules, the Domino's franchise has 30 days from the time the order is served to file an appeal, but a statement from the company said: \"Our franchisee appeared in front of the Ministry of Labour, responded to the inquiry and will fully comply with the ruling issued by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n\"There are no plans to appeal the ruling,\" said Jeff Kacmarek, vice-president of marketing and new product development with the Domino's Pizza of Canada.\n\nThe Domino's Pizza franchise in Mississauga, Ont., where Cervantes worked for years.

Our whole team came out ready to play, and we made it hard on their [defence].\"\n\nToronto opened a three-game California road swing with another dominant performance, leading 2-0 just 6:12 in and getting 11 shots on net before Los Angeles got its first. The Maple Leafs scored three power-play goals and continued their impressive start to the season despite the continued absence of holdout William Nylander and star Auston Matthews, who missed his seventh straight game with a shoulder injury.\n\nFast identity\n\nKadri said the Leafs dominated \"by being fast. I think that's the identity of our team, and we wanted to use it to our advantage.\"\n\nTavares scored a goal in his third consecutive game, connecting on the power play in the first period for his 11th goal of the season. The star forward already has 22 points in 18 games during his debut season with his hometown team.\n\n\"[Tavares] has been great,\" said Rielly, who leads all NHL defencemen with 23 points after getting a goal and an assist. \"We're 18 games in, and he's been outstanding.

If we don't get our minds to it and actually get it done on the ice, it doesn't mean anything.\"\n\nBudaj chased\n\nJohnsson's goal early in the second period put Toronto up 4-1 and chased Peter Budaj, who stopped 15 shots. He was replaced by Cal Petersen, who stopped 15 shots in his NHL debut.\n\nThe Kings are down to their top two AHL goalies after Jack Campbell joined Jonathan Quick on injured reserve this week with torn meniscuses in their knees.\n\n\"I was a little surprised\" to get put in the game, Petersen said. \"I didn't hear the coach right away. It was an exciting moment, and I got to face a shot right away, which helped. I was just trying not to make it bigger than it is.\"\n\nBut even LA's normally sturdy penalty-killing units struggled against Toronto, giving up multiple power-play goals for only the second time this season.\n\nKempe ended his 12-game goalless streak with a first-period deflection, but Rielly put Toronto up 3-1 early in the second after two Leafs converged on Kings defenceman Drew Doughty and forced a turnover.\n\nJohnsson then scored after four Kings stood and watched while Travis Dermott skated the puck from the point to the net for a pass.\n\nKadri connected again late in the second period for his fourth goal in four games and his seventh in nine games.", "A trio of city councillors sent Parker lands owner Andrew Marquess back to the drawing board by rejecting land-use changes that would have paved the way for a development called Fulton Grove.\n\nCouncil's city centre community committee voted late Tuesday evening to reject a proposal to subdivide and rezone 47 acres of land at the northern edge of Fort Garry for the purposes of building thousands of new residential units.\n\nIn September, a provincial judge ordered up the public hearing after deciding the city has taken too long to approve Marquess's plans for the area.\n\nCouns.

Only some of them chose to speak at the hearing, which concluded shortly before 1 a.m.\n\nBroadcaster Scott Oake, who lost his son Bruce to an overdose in 2011, said he wanted to convince councillors not just of the need for an addictions-treatment centre, but of the prospect it may operate without conflict in Crestview.\n\n\"Recovery centres, the likes of which we are proposing can function beautifully in the midst of urban and residential neighbourhoods, and there are countless examples of that across the country,\" Oake said before the hearing.\n\nJennifer Bautista, whose son Gabriel Pereira died by suicide in July after struggling with mental-health issues and addiction, told the committee the need for more treatment options is immense.\n\n\"I wasn't supposed to mourn my 20-year-old son,\" she said.\n\nCouns.

Lukes and Gillingham to recuse themselves from the hearing because they voted on the Vimy Arena sale in January. The councillors declined that request.\u200b\n\nAssiniboia MLA Steven Fletcher, who opposes the addictions treatment centre, told the committee not to be swayed by family members who've lost loved ones.\n\n\"Empathy should not lead to poor decision-making,\" he said, calling Winnipeg's plan to sell off the Vimy Arena site \"a shady deal.\"\n\nCouncil voted in January to sell the decommissioned arena site, which was valued at $1.4 million, to the province for $1.\n\nThe province intends to transfer the site to the non-profit Bruce Oake foundation.\n\nThe land-use changes for the site now face approval from council's property committee, executive policy committee and ultimately council as a whole.\n\nScott Oake said he would like to see construction begin this summer, pending council approval.", "Edmonton buses could have new driver safety features installed as early as January.\n\nThe city's executive committee approved agreements on Tuesday with two contractors that will provide an $11.7 million upgrade to Edmonton buses, including the installation of safety shields for drivers.\n\nA new city report says Vapor Bus International will install shields on all city buses in an effort to improve transit operator safety \u2014 a hot topic since late September, when a bus driver was stabbed at the Mill Woods Transit Centre.\n\nShield installation will cost $6.95 million, pending capital budget approval. Mississauga Bus Group of Companies will provide an additional $4.75 million in heating and air conditioning upgrades for the enclosed workspaces.\n\nMark Tetterington, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, hopes to see driver shields on buses by January, as the manufacturer will work on an expedited timeline.\n\nThe goal of installing the shields is to keep Edmonton bus drivers safe from violent passengers. (CBC)\n\nThe shields are a crucial part of transit safety upgrades, which include new security guards, he said.\n\n\"That's number one for us,\" he said. \"To me, that's more important than even the security presence because those retractable shields are just like a powered window in a car.\"\n\nThe shields will enclose the space where bus drivers sit, reaching from the floor to about 12 inches below the ceiling, Tetterington said. They're made of tempered glass, and have a retractable window that rolls up in about three seconds.\n\n\"You can just raise it and lower it. As you feel threatened, you can just raise it up so there's no longer a threat,\" Tetterington said.\n\n\"We're going to try to encourage operators that when they're using them, you know, 'Don't raise them up unless you feel like you're threatened.'\"\n\nThe shields will first be installed on 159 buses with air conditioning, followed by the rest of the fleet, which will require upgrades to regulate the temperature within the closed operators' spaces.", "An Ontario judge has declined to make a decision in a controversial case looking at the definition of death in Ontario, after a fellow judge delivered a decision on a strikingly similar case in June.\n\nSuperior Court Justice Glenn Hainey declared the Shalom Ouanounou case moot in a ruling released on Sunday.\n\nOver the past year, the cases of Ouanounou and Taquisha McKitty have both forced Ontario courts to weigh whether religious beliefs trump the accepted understanding of medical death.\n\nBoth cases concern young people who were declared brain dead, but whose families fought to keep them on life support, arguing they adhered to religious beliefs that stipulate a person is still alive as long as their heart is beating, and that to take them off life support violated their charter rights.\n\nIn June, Justice Lucille Shaw rejected McKitty's family's plea to keep her on life support, writing in her potentially precedent-setting decision that the medical profession establishes the guidelines that determine death.\n\nTaquisha McKitty is seen here with her daughter. Her family is appealing the June decision that found she is brain dead and therefore can be taken off life support. (Instagram)\n\n\"At common law, death includes brain death, and brain death is to be determined by medical criteria,\" she wrote.\n\nThat set the stage for Ouanounou's case to be declared by moot by Hainey, who wrote in his Nov. 11 decision that \"the issues I must determine \u2026 have already been determined by Justice Shaw.\"\n\nOuanounou has since been buried\n\nOuanounou, 25, a devout Jew, was declared dead in September 2017, shortly after an asthma attack deprived his brain of oxygen. In November, his family successfully applied for an emergency injunction to keep him on life support, where he remained for months.\n\nIn early March, Ouanounou's respiratory and cardiac systems failed and he was declared dead again, this time by a Jewish doctor brought in by his family, and was buried after a Jewish funeral.\n\nAt that point, Hainey began examining the question of whether his case was now moot.\n\nOver the course of the summer, Hainey then received written submissions from Ouanounou's family, doctors, and Jewish community groups, among others, and examined the McKitty decision.\n\n\"My decision on this application will add nothing to the jurisprudence concerning these issues,\" he concluded.\n\nFamily lawyer disagrees\n\nThe Ouanounou family's lawyer, Hugh Scher, doesn't see it that way.\n\nHe told CBC News he thinks the McKitty case, for which he was also the lawyer, is different than the Ouanounou case, in part because McKitty's case had also involved arguments from her family that she showed signs of life and therefore could not be dead.\n\nHe says the issue has not been conclusively settled for the segment of Ontario's Jewish population who subscribe to the belief that the only real death is the cessation of a heartbeat.\n\n\"For certain members of the Orthodox Jewish community, this is going to be an ongoing issue,\" said Scher.\n\nHe also argues that the fact that Ouanounou had two competing death certificates \u2014 one from September, and one from March \u2014 meant that the case's conflict was ongoing.\n\nBut Hainey's decision dismisses that as a \"live controversy,\" writing that \"no party has advanced an argument about what, if anything, turns on the fact that there are two death certificates.\"\n\nScher counters that the existence of two death certificates \u2014 one based on a religious definition of death, another on the accepted medical definition \u2014 indicates that the tension between religious accommodation and death remains unresolved.\n\nScher also noted that all parties in the case, including the doctors he was arguing against, had asked Hainey to make his own ruling on the issue.\n\nMcKitty's appeal has begun\n\nAn appeal of Justice Shaw's decision has been launched by the McKitty family, with a hearing set for December. In the meantime, Scher said, she remains on life support in hospital.\n\nAs for the Ouanounou case, he doesn't yet know if the family will opt to challenge Hainey's decision.\n\n\"Any appeal would only be dealing with the question of mootness ... so it doesn't really get to the heart of the matter,\" said Scher.\n\nThe Ouanounou family now has 30 days to decide if they want to move forward with an appeal.", "Paul Dinn is a councillor for the Town of Paradise and now the candidate for the Progressive Conservatives in a provincial byelection.

Philadelphia had previously been the subject of a local grand jury investigation that found similar patterns of abuse.\n\nDetails of the compensation program were discussed at a news conference held by independent claims administrators and members of an independent oversight committee who said they've already mailed out informational packets to 342 survivors who previously reported credible abuse claims.\n\nVictims in the Philadelphia archdiocese, which covers Philadelphia city and county, as well as Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties, must register claims by July 31 and file them by Sept. 30 under the program. Most of the state's seven other dioceses are expected to follow with their own compensation funds opening to claims early next year, according to statements released late last week.\n\nKen Feinberg and Camille Biros are administrators of claims submitted to the Independent Reconciliation and Reparations Program, a new clergy child sexual abuse victim compensation fund set up by the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Philadelphia. (Jacqueline Larma/Associated Press)\n\nFive of the dioceses\u2014 including Philadelphia\u2014 have hired veteran compensation fund co-ordinator Ken Feinberg to design and operate their programs. Feinberg and co-administrator Camille Biros ran victims' compensation funds set up by five New York dioceses in recent years. Feinberg was also the administrator of several other high-profile compensation funds including for the Aurora, Colorado theatre shooting victims and as special master for the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.\n\nNo amount of money is going to provide closure to that victim or satisfy the victim. It is a small step in helping that victim at least secure some degree of financial security. - Ken Feinberg, compensation fund coordinator\n\nAt the news conference Tuesday, Feinberg outlined several features of the Philadelphia program that make it different from others in the past, including it is completely independent and voluntary.\n\n\"The program in awarding compensation really performs two functions with the victim. People focus on the money,\" he said. \"No amount of money is going to provide closure to that victim or satisfy the victim. It is a small step in helping that victim at least secure some degree of financial security. Just as importantly we have found in our work in New York, that a claimant who files a claim with us and receives compensation finds some degree of validation as to that claim. Do not underestimate the importance of this.\"\n\nArthur Baselice, of Philadelphia, says his son was abused by a priest and a religious brother, became addicted to drugs and killed himself. (Matt Rourke/Associated Press)\n\nPayouts and total fund amounts will not be disclosed by the diocese, and church officials will have no say in decisions about eligibility or payout amounts. There will be no appeals process, and if a claimant accepts a compensation offer, they must waive their right to sue the archdiocese for any past or future abuse.\n\nPayouts not capped\n\nLawyers who help settle child sexual abuse cases say courts generally promise a bigger payout, while dioceses face the possibility a judge can order them to divulge records of child sexual abuse complaints and how they handled them. Plaintiffs also can extract court-approved agreements from dioceses to add procedures or training to better protect children going forward. Some of the money goes to lawyers' fees, and the church's defenders say that motivates civil lawyers.\n\nWhile payouts won't be capped, $500,000 US is the most paid out to one individual during Feinberg's administration of claims against the New York dioceses. The size of the payouts is determine by numerous factors, including the severity of the abuse, the age of the victim and the long-term effect on the victim's life.\n\nA victim compensation often delivers a faster payout to victims. Biros said once claims are filed, most should be processed and paid within 90 days.\n\nVictims do not have to accept the compensation offers, and don't have to waive their right to sue if they reject an offer. But many victims may fall outside the window to file a civil claim against the archdiocese under Pennsylvania law.\n\nA legislative effort to change state law to allow a two-year window for people to sue in abuse cases that are otherwise too old to pursue passed the state House, but it was blocked by Republican state senators last month. Opponents, including Catholic bishops and the insurance industry, expressed concerns about the cost and argued that a retroactive change would violate the state constitution.\n\nProponents have said negotiations on the change are continuing.\n\nState Attorney General Josh Shapiro, whose office oversaw the grand jury investigation, said the grand jury \"recommended that victims deserve their day in court \u2014 not that the church should be the arbiter of its own punishment.\"\n\nThe Philadelphia archdiocese said its program will be overseen by the independent committee, including former U.S. senator George Mitchell of Maine, former interim Philadelphia District Attorney Kelley Hodge and Lawrence Stengel, a retired federal judge. The diocese plans to sell properties as one way to bolster the fund, but will not dip into money for charities, seminaries, donor-designated gifts or donations to parishes, ministries or schools.\n\nThe program offers pro-bono legal representation if victims want a lawyer and offers help from a victim support facilitator who can help with the claims process.", "A trial has begun for a southern Alberta man who has a 14-year history of sexually assaulting underage girls.\n\nTrevor Pritchard, 34, is being tried by judge alone in Lethbridge on charges of sexual assault, luring and possession of child pornography. The two girls, who were both 14 years old at the time of the alleged offences, will both testify during the three-week trial.\n\nPritchard has four prior convictions for sexually assaulting underage girls in 2004, 2009, 2010 and 2018, though he has applied to back out of his guilty plea from earlier this year.\n\nFive years ago, police warned the public the registered sex offender was likely to reoffend, targeting girls under the age of 16.\n\nPritchard used two Facebook accounts to \"engage in sexual communication\" with several young teen girls, prosecutor Sarah Goard-Baker alleged during her opening statement on Tuesday morning.\n\nPritchard is accused of having unprotected sex with a 14-year-old girl, Goard-Baker told Court of Queen's Bench Justice Johanna Kubik.\n\nIn January 2017, Pritchard was living east of Lethbridge in Coaldale when he was arrested on six other charges including sexual assault, abduction and uttering threats.\n\nAfter those allegations came to light and Pritchard was first charged, two girls under the age of 16 contacted police \u2014 resulting in the trial which is now underway.\n\nThreatened to kill victim\n\nIn November 2013, Lethbridge Police issued a public warning when Pritchard was released from prison after serving his 44-month sentence for sexually assaulting two 13-year-old girls.\n\nPolice said at the time he was at high risk to reoffend against girls under 16, and that he posed a significant risk of harm to the community.\n\nIn April, Pritchard pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting and luring a 15-year-old girl he had met on Facebook. He has since applied to back out of his pleas after learning prosecutor Donna Spaner is seeking a dangerous offender designation which could land Pritchard in prison indefinitely.\n\nAs part of his guilty plea, Pritchard admitted to meeting the teenage girl in January 2017, after telling her he would drive her to a job interview.\n\nPritchard instead took the girl to his home in Coaldale and told her the interview would not be happening.\n\nHe then forced her to participate in various sexual acts, according to an agreed statement of facts signed by Pritchard.\n\nWhen he drove her home later he threatened to kill the girl if she told anyone what happened, but the victim told her mother who then contacted police.\n\nPritchard now wants to back out of his guilty plea and in February 2019, defence lawyer Bill Wister will argue his client's convictions should be vacated.", "Le'Veon Bell won't play in 2018.\n\nThe star running back declined to sign his one-year, $14.4-million US franchise tender with the Pittsburgh Steelers by Tuesday's deadline, making him ineligible to suit up for the AFC North-leading Steelers or anyone else this season.\n\nThe unusual decision to sit out won't prevent Bell from becoming a free agent next spring, when the three-time Pro Bowler hopes to cash in with a contract that would make him the highest-paid back in the NFL.\n\nSteelers head coach Mike Tomlin seemed resigned to Bell's decision shortly before the 4 p.m. ET deadline, saying simply \"so be it\" when asked about the possibility of Bell never returning to the team that drafted him in the second round of the 2013 draft and helped mould him into one of the league's top players.\n\n\"Even when we don't understand it, we're sensitive to it, so we're not shocked when things happen from a business standpoint, no,\" Tomlin said.\n\nThe Steelers, who have won five straight to sprint to the top of the division heading into a visit to Jacksonville on Sunday, will turn to second-year back James Conner and reserves Stevan Ridley and rookie Jaylen Samuels to help shoulder the load with Bell out of the picture.\n\nLinchpin\n\nAll season Tomlin stressed he was focused on the players in the locker room and not the ones outside it and hardly seems bothered by Pittsburgh's quest for a post-season berth without the talented 26-year-old Bell.\n\n\"That train has left the station,\" Tomlin said. \"We're comfortable with how we function, the people at our disposal, the division of labour and our ability to ready ourselves for the challenges.\"\n\nThe Steelers drafted Bell with the 48th overall pick in the 2013 draft, won over by his youth, size and versatility. Along with wide receiver Antonio Brown, Bell became the linchpin in which the Steelers rebuilt themselves on the fly as the franchise's identity shifted from away from the defence that fuelled three Super Bowl appearances in six years from 2005-2010 toward an offence that ranked among the most dynamic in the league.\n\nThe makeover relied heavily on Bell, whose patient running style became his trademark while helping Pittsburgh to four straight playoff berths.\n\nBell is one of only three players to be franchise tagged in consecutive seasons. The first two, linebacker Karlos Dansby and quarterback Kirk Cousins, played all 16 games during their second season under the tag then went and cashed in elsewhere in free agency.\n\nAs his star rose, Bell insisted he wasn't merely a running back, pointing to his success as a receiver \u2014 he finished 10th in the league with 85 catches in 2017 \u2014 as proof that he should be paid far above his peers.\n\nTeammates frustrated\n\nWhen Bell and the Steelers failed to reach an agreement on a new deal last summer, he said \"both sides worked extremely hard\" in an attempt to get something done. When it didn't happen, he skipped training camp again, just as he did in 2017. His teammates stressed it was no big deal, confident Bell would show up in time for the regular-season opener.\n\nOnly he didn't. And when preparations for Pittsburgh's Week 1 trip to Cleveland began without Bell, several of his teammates, particularly the offensive line, vented their frustrations publicly.\n\nThe anger eased as the weeks passed and Conner thrived in Bell's absence while Bell remained in Florida, where encounters captured on social media found him riding a Jet Ski or hitting the club. He returned to Pittsburgh last week and even played some pickup basketball at a fitness centre.\n\nIt's as close to breaking a sweat with the Steelers as Bell will get. Though the team could use the franchise or transition tag on Bell next spring, it's more likely he'll just walk away.\n\nNow the player who would frequently place his hand on the back of an offensive lineman while waiting for a hole to open \u2014 much as a child sticking close to a parent in a crowded store \u2014 finds himself all alone in uncharted territory.", "More than 20 child murderers have been transferred to Indigenous healing lodges since 2011, according to numbers from Public Safety Canada.\n\nAt least 14 of those offenders were held in healing lodges while the previous Conservative government was in power.\n\nThe federal government released those numbers in response to a request from CBC News Network's Power & Politics in the wake of a wave of outrage over child killer Terri-Lynne McClintic's transfer to an Indigenous healing lodge in southern Saskatchewan last December.\n\nShe was transferred back to a traditional prison in Edmonton last week.\n\nMcClintic is serving a life sentence for the brutal rape and murder of Tori Stafford, 8, of Woodstock, Ont.\n\nNews of McClintic's transfer to a healing lodge became public in September and quickly became a point of heated political debate in the House of Commons.

The service boundaries are Hampton, Musquash, Grand Bay and the Saint John Airport.\n\n\"It really takes more volunteers than a smaller community,\" she said.\n\nEach night ,Butler said, the goal is to have 10 teams of three, so no one has to be turned down.\n\nOperation Red Nose is a donation-based service, so technically it's free.\n\n\"But what we suggest is what would it cost if you were to take a taxi,\" Butler said. \"The more you donate, the more we donate, and the more money that we get to give to PRO Kids at the end.\"\n\nIn the last three years, the operation raised $16,000 for the charity, Boudreau said.", "Alberta Premier Rachel Notley is challenging Jason Kenney to make good on his promise to deal with extremists by throwing John Carpay out of the United Conservative Party.\n\n\"I think that if Mr. Kenney wants to convince Albertans that they should not be worried about the long-term agenda of the UCP, then he needs to demonstrate it by suggesting that Mr. Carpay doesn't have a home in that party,\" Notley said Tuesday after a signing ceremony with the Lubicon Lake Band in northern Alberta.\n\nKenney has faced calls to cancel Carpay's membership since the Calgary lawyer likened the LGBTQ pride flag to the swastika of Nazi Germany and the Communist hammer and sickle at a conference Saturday organized by Rebel Media. He also suggested the gay rights movement was an example of totalitarianism.\n\nCarpay later apologized for \"unintentionally\" drawing that comparison.\n\nKenney acknowledged that apology in a tweet on Sunday. He condemned Carpay's remarks, calling any such comparison \"vile, particularly given the violent persecution of LGBT people under such regimes.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Kenney revoked the UCP membership of a former call-centre worker on his leadership campaign for ties to a white supremacist website. He told reporters the party was thinking about creating a database of extremists to help screen membership applications.\n\nKenney has not said what he plans to do about Carpay's membership.

Sign up here to get it delivered directly to your inbox every weekday.\n\nHere's what you need to know right now from the world of sports:\n\nEverything you wanted to know about the Calgary Olympic vote (but were afraid to ask)\n\nAs I'm typing this, Calgarians are voting in a plebiscite asking whether they want their city to continue pursuing the 2026 Winter Olympics. In case you haven't been following this story, here are answers to some questions you may have, starting with the most basic:\n\nWhat's a plebiscite?\n\nIt's like a referendum, but the results are non-binding (more on that later). In this one, voters are being asked this question: \"Are you for or are you against Calgary hosting the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games?\"\n\nWhen will we know the result?\n\nPolls close at 8 p.m. Mountain Time and results are expected around 10 p.m. (that's midnight Eastern).\n\nSo the city will do whatever the people say?\n\nDepends. As mentioned, the plebiscite is non-binding. So the final say goes to the 15 members of Calgary's city council. It might be politically risky for them to go against the will of the people, but a slim majority could give them some leeway.\n\nLet's say the vote comes out to 50 per cent plus one in favour of hosting the Olympics. Council may say that's not a strong enough mandate and shut the bid down. But if the \"no\" side wins by any margin, the bid is probably dead. It would be dicey to try and force it through, and the Alberta government has said it'll only chip in the $700 million it promised if Calgarians vote \"yes.\"\n\nWhat's the case for hosting the Olympics?\n\nThe \"yes\" side is touting both tangible and intangible benefits. No one can say for sure how big the economic bump will be (and that \"$10 back for every $1 spent\" line you may have heard definitely sounds fishy) but it's not nothing. Before the Games, you get some construction projects to build new venues and infrastructure or refurbish existing stuff. During the Games, you get tens of thousands of visitors pouring into the city for a month. After the Games, you get to keep those facilities you built or renovated. For Calgary, that'll include making things more accessible for the Paralympics, which weren't part of the package when the city hosted the Olympics in 1988.\n\nIt takes more imagination to buy into the intangibles. There's the hope of a morale boost for a town that's been hit hard by plummeting oil prices, and the Olympics are a chance for Calgary to promote itself on the world stage. The Games worked pretty well for Calgary in '88. That was a long time ago (and the Games were a lot cheaper and easier to pull off then), but the power of nostalgia is working in the \"yes\" side's favour.\n\nWhat's the case against hosting the Olympics?\n\nMostly that it's too expensive. Olympic Games are notorious for going over budget, and even if you take the Calgary bid corporation's estimate at face value, 2026 will cost more than $5 billion. They're asking taxpayers to cover about half that \u2014 including $390 million from Calgary and more than $1.4 billion from the federal government, plus Alberta's end. Critics say the economic impact doesn't justify that price tag.\n\nIronically, some opponents have criticized the bid corporation's budget for being too skinny. It's great that you'll refurbish old venues, they say, but that means less shiny new stuff for the city to enjoy after the Games \u2014 like maybe a new arena for the Calgary Flames. Then there's the whole matter of doing business with the International Olympic Committee, which has been plagued by corruption scandals.\n\nWhich side will win?\n\nI'm a betting man, and I wouldn't put a dollar on either side. Credible polling data is hard to come by \u2014 if it exists at all. The only concrete number we have is the 8-7 margin by which council voted a couple of weeks ago to halt the bid process and cancel the plebiscite. It's only still alive because a super-majority of 10 votes was needed for the motion to pass.\n\nWhichever way the vote goes, tomorrow's edition of The Buzzer will break down what comes next for Calgary, the rest of Canada and the 2026 Olympics.\n\nNostalgia for the '88 Games could work in favour of Calgary's 2026 bid.

The notorious Washington Capitals forward initially got 20 games for his (latest) illegal hit. He appealed, and it eventually went to a neutral arbitrator. By the time the arbitrator issued his 41-page opinion today (no wonder it took so long) and cut the ban to 14 games, Wilson had already missed 16.

It includes an Instagram image of an overturned van and trailer lying by the side of a dark road.\n\nLead singer Reuben Bullock says no one was badly hurt but their vehicles were \"totalled\" Friday night. He says the trailer broke open, sending gear across the road and damaging irreplaceable instruments, including his guitar.\n\nBullock was in Toronto at the time \u2014 he and bandmates Shea Alain and Dino Soares flew to their next tour stop while bass player Ian Jarvis drove alongside passengers Brock Geiger, the band's guitarist, and Kris Harper, a member of their opening band, nehiyawak.\n\nBullock says the trio were trapped in the van for a few minutes until rescuers could remove the windshield. Jarvis escaped unscathed but his two passengers suffered minor injuries. Bullock says no other vehicles were involved.\n\nBullock says his bandmates were slated to fly to Toronto on Tuesday for a performance Wednesday and another show Saturday in Montreal.\n\n\"We're super lucky that we're not dealing with anything more serious,\" Bullock said Tuesday by phone in Toronto, where he's now based.\n\n\"Something like this is always in the back of your mind for sure.... Now I'm finding out what I really have insurance for. Before you kind of just check a couple of boxes and don't think about it but now it's going to change a lot of things in how I prepare for this.\"\n\nHe said it had snowed the day before.\n\nRescuers cut out windshield\n\nHis bandmates headed out at about 9 a.m. that morning, hoping to reach Calgary by end of day. They veered off a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway that luckily had a shoulder instead of a ditch, he says.\n\n\"The rescue crew had to cut the windshield out of the van to get them out,\" said Bullock, adding that the trio were taken to hospital in Golden, B.C.\n\n\"Kris tore something in his shoulder, Brock had a pretty good concussion and some pretty serious whiplash. He's kind of waiting on a CT scan still but he's actually flying out for the show, which is pretty crazy. And then Ian, the driver, he's apparently completely fine.\"\n\nThe crash capped a trouble-plagued tour that included a failed transmission about five days earlier in the middle of a stretch between Calgary and Saskatoon, said Bullock. Then, a band member missed the gig in Winnipeg, forcing Bullock's wife to fly in as substitute. When they reached Victoria, they noticed the tire treads on their brand new trailer had completely worn out.\n\n\"It's kind of been one of those tours that really tests everybody. But the audience and the reception and all of the shows every night have been so, so amazing that ... I still look at this whole tour as being the best tour we've been in. But it's definitely been the hardest.\"\n\nBullock says he has insurance on the van, trailer and instruments. But there have been several out-of-pocket expenses, including the cost of the ambulance, tow truck, shipping the equipment, flying band members to Toronto, and renting a new vehicle for their show in Montreal.\n\nIn the meantime, Bullock is hitting up friends to try to pull together enough equipment to play the final two shows of this leg. In December, they head to Ireland but plans are afoot for another road trip through Ontario and Quebec in typically snowy February and March.\n\n\"Vehicle to be determined,\" says Bullock.", "Peel police are appealing for witnesses after releasing a video of a Friday evening hit and run on Tuesday.\n\nPolice say that at 5:30 p.m. that evening, a 65-year-old woman was crossing a driveway entrance to several businesses in the area of Meadowvale and Meadowpine boulevards in Mississauga when she was hit.\n\nThe victim was taken to a trauma centre, and police say that she is still in serious but stable condition.\n\nThe collision was one of several that sent pedestrians to hospital Friday.

It can cost more than $500 a month to commute. It's going to be a sizeable portion of your budget.\"\n\nCMHC estimates of monthly commuting costs for a single car and driver from some of the cities surrounding Toronto. (CMHC)\n\nUsing 2016 census data from Statistics Canada and estimates of housing costs from the same year from the Toronto Real Estate Board, the study crunched the numbers on housing and commuting costs.\n\nCommuting costs up to $800 a month\n\nCommuting costs ranged from an average of under $200 a month in the city of Toronto, to more than $800 a month in Halton Hills to the northwest, Georgina to the north and Clarington to the east of the city. For the closer suburbs, such as Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, Markham and Pickering, the cost of commuting was estimated at between $200 and $399 a month.\n\nThat's the cost of if there's only one person commuting in every household. But the figure is likely higher if both partners commute, Scott said. The CMHC's estimates factor the cost of operating a vehicle, but not the cost of parking \u2014 another added expense\n\nThe CMHC study did not compare the cost of living in downtown Toronto to the cost of living and commuting from the nearby suburbs such as Scarborough and Etobicoke.\n\nBut it estimated that the cost of a commuting within Toronto was just $115 a month \u2014 reflecting the fact that many people bike, walk or use transit and have very low costs to get to work.\n\n\"One of the things that makes commuting costs lower in Toronto is that residents have ready access to rapid transit,\" Scott said.\n\nHere's the trade-off between commuting costs and housing costs compared with the cost of housing and commuting in Toronto. (Statistics Canada/Toronto Real Estate Board/CMHC)\n\nHe said commuting by transit is generally cheaper for suburban commuters, as it is for city dwellers. But transit inevitably takes longer \u2014 and how much longer you are willing to spend commuting via transit depends on how you value your time, he said.\n\nThis is an argument in favour of more investment in transit to the GTA suburbs, Scott said, as it is clear people are moving outside the city in an effort to afford a home.\n\nAbout 67 per cent of commuters who live in the 905 area come into the city by car. Even within the city limits, 49 per cent of commuters use a car, the study found.\n\nThe number of people making long commutes is rising, with a 16 percentage point increase in the number of people who commute for more than an hour each way from 2011 to 2016.\n\nAbout 600,000 of Toronto's 2.6 million commuters drove or rode transit for about 45 minutes, but 377,000 said it took more than an hour to get to work.\n\nThe farther they moved from the city, the lower the cost of homes and the lower their mortgage borrowing costs.\n\nDepends where you buy\n\nWhile housing is more affordable in places such as Clarington, Oshawa and Pickering, there has been pressure on housing costs in these areas as more people decide that living in Toronto is not affordable and seek a home outside the city, Scott said.\n\nThe trade-off between the cost of the commuting and the cost of carrying a home depends on where you buy, but commuting has a cost in both time and money, Scott said.\n\n\"Everyone in the GTA is different, but we wanted to bring attention the housing cost versus commuting cost.\"\n\n\u200b \u200b\n\nIn cities like Oakville, Aurora, Richmond Hill, Vaughan and Markham, the larger size of homes means the average house price is higher than in the city, even without factoring commuting costs.\n\n\"It's hard to say why people opt for the suburbs, but wanting a single detached home can be something central for a lot of people,\" he added.\n\nSome people enjoy a suburban lifestyle or they may select where they live because of a school they want for their children, Scott said.", "This week, the transgender community in Vancouver will be celebrating and memorializing victims of transphobic violence during the international week of awareness leading up to the Transgender Day of Remembrance Nov. 20.\n\nB.C. is ahead of the curve when it comes to transgender rights, and education on inclusion in schools is improving levels of acceptance, said Morgane Oger, the chair of the Trans Alliance Society.\n\n\"There's an active effort in schools by educators to include diversity in the education,\" she told The Early Edition's Stephen Quinn.\n\nTo all the amazing LGBTQ+ students and families out there, here is a reminder that you're supported, included, and no different than anyone else! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LoveWins?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LoveWins</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOGIis4ME?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SOGIis4ME</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bced?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bced</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bcpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bcpoli</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOGI123?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SOGI123</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOGI?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SOGI</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LGBTQ?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LGBTQ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0eLICRANqx\">https://t.co/0eLICRANqx</a> \u2014@BradDirks\n\nOger said the addition of the SOGI 123 initiative, which requires all schools to include sexual orientation and gender identity into their anti-bullying policies, has been successful in exposing children to \"the diversity of the universe they live in.\"\n\n\"For example, rather than always talking about \"Billie\" and \"Suzie\"... and they have a mom and a dad, now we talk about maybe sometimes they have two moms and one of the parents might be trans.\"\n\nThe province recently took another step in acknowledging people who identify as non-binary \u2014 meaning they subscribe to neither male or female genders \u2014 by offering the option of marking an 'X' in the gender field on primary ID, which Oger said is a \"major win\" for the community.\n\nAdvocate Morgane Oger says B.C. is ahead of the curve on transgender rights and inclusion, but, just south of the border, transgender gains are being eroded by the Trump administration.

Unable to find affordable childcare in order to go to a job that pays minimum wage.\n\nThese are the stories a group working on raising Newfoundland and Labrador's minimum wage says they have heard as they travel the province.\n\nWomen are not born vulnerable. - Jenny Wright\n\nRaising N.L.'s minimum wage to $15 an hour would help people rise out of poverty or near-poverty while providing a boost to the overall economy, says Common Front NL, a coalition of organizations in the province working toward increased minimum wage.\n\n\"The more that you're bringing folks out of the poverty line, the more that you're lifting people up, the more money that actually stays in the local economy,\" said Alyse Stuart, chair of Common Front NL.\n\nCommon Front NL launched its $15 and Fairness campaign Tuesday in St. John's.\n\nIncreased minimum wage is one of the easiest tools we have available to reduce the complicated problem of poverty, including child poverty, said Jenny Wright, executive director of the St. John's Status of Women Council.\n\n\"This is such a quick and efficient tool to better and change people's lives, and in that sense it's just a win-win,\" Wright said.\n\nOntario's $15 wage plans on hold\n\nCampaigns to increase minimum wages have begun in cities across Canada and the United States in recent years, and several jurisdictions have committed to increasing the minimum wage for workers.\n\nAmazon recently announced it would increase its company-wide minimum wage to $15 per hour, for example, and Seattle raised the wage to the same level.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador has the second-lowest minimum wage in Canada at $11.15 per hour. (Bruce Tilley/CBC)\n\nHowever, Ontario's new PC government cancelled a previously-planned minimum wage increase when it took office. The raise, which would have put minimum wage at $15, was derided by the PCs as difficult for businesses to absorb.\n\nWhen the minimum wage previously increased, some businesses \u2014 including larger ones like Tim Hortons \u2014 said they had to raise prices or cut benefits, even work breaks, to make up for the extra operating cost.\n\nResponses like that are why the Common Front NL campaign is asking for not only an increased minimum wage, but fair working conditions as well.\n\nResearch on effects of $15/h\n\nCommon Front NL cited a study on the wage increase in Seattle that showed so far, workers have made more money despite having fewer working hours.\n\nAs well, the Seattle study found that employee turnover has decreased in the city, That's just one of the benefits of a higher minimum wage, for both employers and employees, Wright said.\n\n\"It's less cost to employers when they don't have a constant turnover,\" she said.\n\nIf we want folks to stay in this province, we need to give them the tools to do so. - Alyse Stuart\n\nAlso, Wright added, when employees earn more money they can spend more in the local economy.\n\nHowever, some research has found that inexperienced workers had fewer opportunities for employment as higher minimum wages meant experienced workers stayed in positions for longer. And overall, the effects of higher minimum wage are hard to study as they touch a variety of different sectors of society.\n\nOne of those sectors is women and children, Wright said, pointing out that women in Newfoundland and Labrador are more likely to be minimum wage earners.\n\nAnd when women are poor their children are too, she said, which is particularly felt in a province with a gender wage gap of 63 per cent.\n\n\"Women are not born vulnerable,\" she said.\n\n\"They are made vulnerable by sexist legislations and policies.\"\n\nMinimum wage now $11.15\n\nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, a person working full time at a minimum-wage job will make about $23,000 annually, Stuart said \u2014 only about 15 per cent above the poverty line.\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador's minimum wage, which is currently $11.15, is now the second lowest in the country \u2014 Saskatchewan is lowest at $11.06 \u2014 but not long ago was relatively high.\n\nAlyse Stuart and Jenny Wright launched Common Front NL's Fight for $15 and Fairness campaign. (Bruce Tilley/CBC)\n\nAs the cost of living has increased, the minimum wage has not changed to match, Stuart said, and now it's harder for people to earn enough to live in the province.\n\nSome local businesses are already choosing to pay more than minimum wage to retain employees, Stuart said.\n\n\"We want folks to stay in this province,\" Stuart said.\n\n\"If we want folks to stay in this province, we need to give them the tools to do so.\"\n\nRead more articles at CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "Four people from Membertou, including two band councillors, have been charged following an altercation last week on the First Nation in Cape Breton.\n\nTwo vehicles were damaged and one woman was treated in hospital with non-life threatening injuries following the incident Nov. 6.\n\nBand councillors Cary Paul, 32, and Craig Joseph Christmas, 41, are charged with assault with a weapon and mischief, according to Cape Breton Regional Police.\n\nJonathan Lindsey Paul, 39, and his wife Ashley Lena Paul, 37, of Membertou are also charged with assault with a weapon, according to police.

set for next year.\n\nRunning back Jerome Messam had been ordered by Judge Sean Dunnigan to appear in person later this week in order to ensure a substantial step was taken in the case.\n\nThe judge had indicated he was frustrated after lawyers representing Messam had appeared in court eight times without any substantial motion on the case.\n\nBut Messam's Toronto defence lawyer, Gavin Holder, had the matter brought into a courtroom Tuesday instead so that his client did not have to attend Thursday.\n\nMessam played for the Stampeders for almost three seasons before joining the Roughriders in February.\n\nHe was playing for the Stampeders in November 2016 when police allege a consensual sexual encounter was videotaped without the woman's consent.\n\nMessam was released from the Saskatchewan Roughriders team after charges were laid in July.\n\nLast week, Holder had a Calgary duty counsel lawyer ask for a two-week adjournment despite a previous order that a meaningful step be

meeting with assigned prosecutor Janice Walsh but never called or rescheduled.\n\nSo, Dunnigan ordered Messam to appear in person on Thursday.\n\nHolder brought the case forward Tuesday in front of

Watch it here.\n\nEL Chapo\n\nJoaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman was once counted amongst the world's richest men, with vast estates, fancy cars, planes, boats and even his own fleet of submarines.\n\nBut for the past two years, his world has shrunk down to the four walls of his windowless solitary confinement cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan.\n\nSince his 2016 arrest and early 2017 extradition, Guzman, the 61-year-old alleged kingpin of Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel, has spent 23 hours a day locked in his room. The lights are always on, there's no television, and the only reading material is the voluminous evidence from his trial. Conditions so austere, his lawyers complained he was losing his sanity.\n\nMexican drug trafficker Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n is escorted by marines as he is presented to the press on Feb. 22, 2014, in Mexico City after his capture. (Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe good news for Guzman is that as of today he has been granted a change of scenery.\n\nThe bad news is that his new accommodations \u2014 in the bowels of the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Brooklyn \u2014 are even more isolated.\n\nAmerican officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to secure a prized prisoner who famously escaped from two Mexican jails, the last time via a sophisticated 1.6-kilometre-long tunnel. For his pre-trial appearances, they escorted him to and from court in a convoy of armoured vehicles, with helicopters buzzing overhead and SWAT team snipers positioned on overlooking rooftops.\n\nBut such measures, which also necessitated the closure of the Brooklyn Bridge twice a day, have been deemed too costly and disruptive for a trial that might last four months or more.\n\nSo as opening arguments began this morning, El Chapo is now being held a few floors below the Brooklyn courtroom Monday through Friday, with plans to move him back to his Manhattan superjail for weekends.\n\nA motorcade believed to be transporting Guzman crosses the Brooklyn Bridge before arriving the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse on Oct. 30. His transfers are conducted under secrecy and heavy security. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters)\n\nGuzman faces 17 charges involving money laundering, conspiracy to commit murder, and the alleged importation of more than 200 tonnes of illegal drugs \u2014 including cocaine, heroin, cannabis and methamphetamine \u2014 to the United States. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\nFor the most part, however, it will be his savage reputation that is on trial.\n\nProsecutors intend to introduce hundreds of thousands of pages of written material and more than 100,000 audio recordings as evidence, and will sketch his rise from impoverished elementary school dropout to one of Mexico's most feared and powerful men.\n\nIn one filing in April, U.S. attorneys indicated that they will introduce YouTube videos that allegedly show El Chapo and his henchmen torturing \"bound and helpless\" rivals.\n\nAnother prosecution document mentions the end of two members of the competing Los Zetas cartel, whom he supposedly had beaten, executed and burned, right after he finished lunch.\n\nOne witness is scheduled to testify about a \"murder house\" in the ultra-violent Texas border city of Ju\u00e1rez, where Sinaloa hitmen are said to have covered the walls in plastic sheeting and installed a special floor drain to deal with the blood.\n\nOver the summer, prosecutors filed a list of Guzman's supposed victims between the beginning of 1989 and the fall of September 2014. It identified 28 individuals and some very broad categories, including \"informants,\" \"members of law enforcement,\" and soldiers of rival cartels.\n\nEduardo Balarezo, El Chapo's lead lawyer, noted the government's intention to introduce evidence that his client \"conspired to murder somewhere between 20 and an infinite number of people over a 25-year period.\"\n\nGuzman's defence attorney, Eduardo Balarezo, speaks to the media outside U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on Oct. 30. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)\n\nBut the presiding judge has ruled that there is cause for concern for those involved in the trial.\n\nThe 12 jurors \u2014 picked from a pool of 1,000 \u2014 are being escorted to and from court by armed U.S. Marshals, and pains are being taken to ensure they remain anonymous. (One prospective juror was excused because his work as a Michael Jackson impersonator made him too easy to track down.)\n\nThe list of witnesses who will testify against Guzman is also cloaked in secrecy. All their names are blacked out in filings, and there are reports that many are being held in secure locations or have been given new identities under protection programs.\n\nGuzman's lawyers have said that they intend to attack the credibility of those witnesses, many of whom are themselves convicted cartel members who have received reduced sentences in exchange for cooperation, or are paid informants.\n\nThe stakes are high.\n\nThis will be the largest drug case in U.S. history, and Guzman faces life behind bars as well as the forfeiture of up to $14 billion US in assets.\n\nEmma Coronel, Guzman's wife, arrives for his trial in Brooklyn federal court on Tuesday. (Mark Lennihan/Associated Press)\n\nJudge Brian Cogan is already proving testy, blasting prosecutors for their evidentiary overkill, and refusing to let Guzman hug his wife as the proceedings opened this morning, citing security concerns.\n\nAnd at least one controversial argument in the case remains up in the air. In late September, the U.S. attorneys asked Cogan to stop the defence from introducing some comments from President Donald Trump, after his own lawyer became a cooperating witness in the Russia investigation.\n\n\"Flipping,\" the President told Fox News, \"almost ought to be illegal.\"\n\nCogan has yet to deliver his ruling.\n\nGlybera\n\nGlybera is a Canadian innovation that became the most expensive drug in the world \u2014 to the chagrin of one of its key developers, writes health reporter Kelly Crowe.\n\nIt's one of the greatest Canadian medical breakthroughs that you've likely never heard about.\n\nGlybera \u2014 the world's first drug approved to treat a genetic disease \u2014 is a made-in-Canada discovery that made history.\n\nBut when it went on the market at a price of $1 million, it was immediately labelled the most expensive drug in the world. It was only sold once.\n\nLast October its licence expired and it quietly disappeared from the market.\n\nDr. Michael Hayden at the University of British Columbia made the pivotal discoveries behind Glybera, but had nothing to do with the commercialization. He was shocked when he heard the price.\n\nDr. Michael Hayden looks over the results of genetic testing for Huntington's disease in this 2008 photo. He was not involved in the commercialization of Glybera, and says helping to develop a drug that the producer priced out of the reach of people it could help is 'not something I was particularly proud of.' (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)\n\n\"To be quite frank, this was not something I was particularly proud of \u2014 that the pricing of this made it out of the reach,\" said Hayden. \"The whole motivation for doing this was to have this available for patients.\"\n\nEven though the drug \u2014 developed to treat a rare genetic disorder called lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) that can cause pancreatitis and severe abdominal pain \u2014 changed the lives of many of the people who received it, Glybera is no longer available anywhere in the world.\n\nThis innovative Canadian discovery has quietly faded to become a footnote in medical history.

She ended up finding a list of tragedies with an entry that caught her attention: \"Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 21 ... crashed ... British Columbia ... when a bomb blew its tail section away ... July 8th 1965.\"\n\nAn investigator surveys the crash site of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 21, which was downed by a bomb over the wilderness of the B.C. interior on July 8, 1965, while en route to Whitehorse from Vancouver. All 52 people on board were killed. (Transport Canada)\n\nHow had we never heard of it?\n\nCurious, I started tracking down people connected to the crash.\n\nEvery person I reached was generous with their time, and eloquent as they told their stories. A woman whose father was killed in the crash sent me hundreds of pages of documents, which I read between editions of The National.\n\nThe details were riveting. Police determined someone on board had planted a bomb in the rear lavatory. They identified four suspects \u2014 all of whom had reasons to make investigators curious \u2014 but never solved the case.\n\nIan Hanomansing examines some of the wreckage of Canadian Pacific Flight 21, which can still be found at the crash site in the B.C. interior more than 50 years after it was downed by a bomb. (Tiffany Foxcroft/CBC)\n\nSo we've decided to see how we could move it forward. We made access-to-information requests and gathered more documents. We talked to family members, including relatives of those suspects who have never spoken publicly. We visited the site of the crash, where pieces of the plane still lie scattered through the forest.\n\nIn a joint project with CBC Podcasts, we've brought in modern-day experts to review the case, including an air-crash investigator, a criminologist using state-of-the-art profiling software, and an explosives expert.\n\nThis is the biggest unsolved mass murder on Canadian soil. It deserves one more shot at trying to figure out who's responsible.\n\nQuote of the moment\n\n\"There's really nothing wrong with the comic book format.

According to the recent annual report of the Responsible Investment Association (RIA), at the end of last year Canada had more than $2.1 trillion Cdn invested in assets based on at least one ESG principle. That's more than half of all the assets under professional management, and it's the first time the figure has tipped over the 50 per cent threshold.\n\nWhat was once a niche part of the investment community has hit the mainstream to become a major determining factor when investors choose where to park their money.\n\n\"Finally it feels like the world is catching up to me,\" says Tim Nash, a Toronto-based fee-for-service financial planner and investment coach. Nash works with individual investors to help their create their portfolios, and he says that sustainability is one of the biggest long-term issues he's warned investors to pay attention to for years.\n\nTechnically, the broad concept of sustainable investing runs the gamut of everything from environmental factors, to social issues such as fair labour practices to governance questions surrounding diversity and female representation. But Nash says, with environmental issues specifically, he sometimes has to deal with a negative bias where some people think that anything \"green\" is somehow by definition going to have a worse financial performance.\n\n\"If it's a cleaning agent, they want the harsh chemicals; if it's an electric car, they assume it doesn't go as far; and with an investment they just assume performance is going to be worse,\" he says, \"against all evidence to the contrary.\"\n\nRetail investors may have been slow to be convinced, but major institutional money has been pouring money into the space for years. With $6 billion US invested worldwide, Blackrock is the biggest single money manager in the world, and Tariq Fancy, the company's chief investment officer for sustainable investing, says investments in things like renewable energy attracting a lot of dollars not just to save the world, but to make money in the long run.\n\nSustainable investing had grown to more than $12 trillion US under management last year. (Rob Easton/CBC)\n\n\"The old way of looking at it was if you want to do sustainable investing you will lose some return, but the industry is realizing that there's no tradeoff,\" he says. \"Looking at sustainability considerations actually does not entail losing return and potentially even can improve it.\"\n\nFancy says a big reason for the growth is that the industry has only recently discovered reliable metrics of monitoring sustainability issues. \"There's an old saying that whatever isn't measured isn't managed,\" he says, which is why the financial community only truly accepts something once there is data to track it.\n\n\"Ten years ago you didn't think about how many steps you were taking because it wasn't easy to measure,\" he says. \"Today you're wearing a Fitbit.\"\n\nThe data is so compelling that Canada's national pension plan is getting in on the action. Because the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is mandated to invest funds to grow and last decades into the future, the appeal of sustainable investing isn't just to boost returns today, but make sure that money will exist for the long haul.\n\n\"Our job is to maximize returns without risk of loss for generations to come,\" says Ben Lambert, the CPP's interim head of sustainable investing. \"And companies that do well on these sustainability issues extend their corporate life and are more likely to create value over the long term.\"\n\nThat's why the CPPIB has earmarked $3 billion Cdn toward renewable energy investments in the past two years, on top of issuing a $1.5 billion Cdn green bond this summer, to raise even more money that is earmarked to be invested in similarly sustainable investments.\n\n\"It's a win-win situation,\" he says. \"It's about doing the right thing and generating returns.\"\n\nAccording to the RIA, 88 per cent of money managers listed a desire to minimize risk as their No. 1 reason for investing sustainably. More than three quarters said improving returns was the main impetus.\n\nDustyn Lanz, CEO of the Toronto-based group, agrees the sustainable investing trend has hit something of a tipping point. The main motivation, he says, is a desire from investors to minimize the risks to which they are exposed. Those risks may not always show up in the places investors traditionally look for them, but they exist.\n\nDustyn Lanz is the CEO of the Responsible Investment Association. (Dustyn Lanz)\n\n\"Risks can be identifiable by investors,\" he says, \"but you can't just find them on the financial statement or balance sheet\n\nIf the current trend continues, it's not hard to imagine a future in which sustainability is not some fringe fad, but a constant investment consideration just like any other.\n\nTo illustrate the point, Fancy notes that many investing trends were niche at first, before being so adopted by the mainstream that they became impossible to ignore.\n\nSixty years ago, the world didn't have standardized accounting standards, but now investors can't imagine a world without them, he notes. And as recently as 30 years ago, the concept of diversifying your assets wasn't universally accepted as being the smart thing to do. The same thing is happening now with sustainability, he argues.\n\n\"In 20 years, people won't think about this as sustainable investing,\" he says, \"they'll just think of it as investing.\"", "People in Metro Vancouver are showing a curious appreciation for our bridges these days.\n\nSpecifically, the underside of bridges.

Prosecutors have said the security is necessary because of Guzman's history of intimidating and even ordering murders of potential witnesses. Guzman's lawyers have called those claims unfounded.\n\nProsecutors have taken extraordinary measures to protect witnesses they plan to call during the trial, which could last up to four months.\n\nEmma Coronel, the wife of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, arrives for his trial in Brooklyn federal court on Tuesday.

None have been publicly named, and some may testify under aliases.\n\nGuzman was one of world's most wanted fugitives until he was captured in January 2016 in his native Sinaloa. He was extradited to the United States a year later.\n\nA lawyer Guzman has said he's ready to defend his client and has nothing to prove. Eduardo Balarezo spoke to journalists while entering the courthouse Tuesday.\n\nPurported billionaire\n\nIn 2009, Forbes Magazine put Guzman on its list of the world's richest people, with an estimated $1 billion US fortune but investigators say it is impossible to know exactly how much he was worth.\n\nHe used his wealth to buy off politicians, police chiefs, soldiers and judges, Mexican prosecutors say. His nickname, a reference to his five-foot six-inch height, is often translated in English as \"Shorty.\"\n\nSeveral former Guzman associates are known to have struck deals to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors, raising the possibility that they will appear on the witness stand.\n\nPolice stand guard during the start of jury selection for Guzman's trial on Nov. 5 at Brooklyn Federal Court in New York.

This exemption is already given to B.C. officers.\n\nThe SIU is responsible for investigating cases where there has been a death, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault involving police.\n\nThe province has amended a regulation to ensure police officers who unsuccessfully administer naloxone will no longer face investigation by the SIU.

She sobbed as her daughters wheeled her off Covenant property.\n\nHoffman has only now, following CBC News' reporting, agreed to any sort of action to address Covenant's policy.\n\nThe Catholic health provider refuses to facilitate MAID,and its default position remains that patients cannot even sign the form requesting an assisted death, or meet with AHS clinicians for the assessments that determine if they are eligible, on Covenant Health property.\n\nUnder Hoffman, the Alberta government exempted Covenant from having to provide access to those services.\n\n72-year-old Bob Hergott, effectively paralyzed from ALS, had to sign his assisted-dying forms in a bus shelter because of Covenant Health's policy. (Verna Young) Covenant is reviewing its MAID policy to \"clarify\" its language around the \"exceptional\" cases where patients are allowed to sign MAID forms and have assessments on-site. Hoffman told CBC News she will monitor that review and enact her own policy if she is not happy with Covenant's new one.\n\nHoffman's press secretary told CBC News the minister was unavailable for an interview about the doctor's 2016 complaint and her response to it.\n\nInstead, the minister sent a statement saying she understands the doctor subsequently discussed concerns with Alberta Health Services' lead on the MAID program. She said AHS then updated its MAID Guide \"to support better discussions with Covenant Health.\"\n\n\"I am deeply saddened by what these patients and their families had to endure at end of life,\" Hoffman said.\n\nThe statement did not explain why Hoffman failed to address Covenant Health's policy when she first learned of how these patients had been treated. Nor did it explain why she continues to tolerate what experts say is an infringement on patients' rights.\n\nThe stories of trauma experienced by Hergott and Nowicki sparked public outrage. Both were patients at Covenant Health facilities in Edmonton. But as the doctor's July 2016 email to Hoffman showed, Covenant's policy also created trauma for patients in rural Alberta.\n\nPatient 'prevented from signing any paperwork'\n\nCBC News is not publishing the name of the doctor, who fears retribution from Covenant Health that would impact their ability to work.\n\n\"This gentleman I assisted was admitted to a Covenant Health hospital and had a physician that was not supportive of MAID,\" the doctor wrote.\n\n\"Because he was in a faith-based hospital and had a physician who was not supportive of him requesting MAID he was prevented from signing any paperwork such as his 'Record of Request' form.\"\n\nThe patient was eventually able to request an assisted death. In the email, the doctor said Covenant allowed the patient to have his first assessment in the hospital.\n\n\"But when I went out to do the second assessment, the patient was not allowed to be on site to discuss his request,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"Thankfully, his [family doctor's] clinic was adjacent to the hospital, where I could interview him and his family. If this was not the case, I am at a loss to know exactly where I would have interviewed him,\" the doctor told Hoffman, adding the closest non-Covenant facility was an hour away. The patient lived even farther away.\n\n'Hoping that he did not bleed out'\n\nA week after that second assessment, the doctor said they learned the patient was experiencing life-threatening rectal bleeding. The patient needed a blood transfusion to stay alive \u2014 just so he could complete the 10-day reflection period typically required before an assisted death can be performed.\n\nIn the complaint to Hoffman, the doctor said the patient would not have experienced that suffering \"if this gentleman had been able to sign his 'Record of Request' when he wanted to, but was prevented from doing so by being in a Covenant Health site.\"\n\nIn May 2017, 66-year-old Doreen Nowicki was forced to have her assisted-dying assessment on an Edmonton sidewalk. Nowicki had late-stage ALS and could no longer walk or speak. (Nowicki family) The doctor said they told the patient's family physician that the 10-day period can be waived if there is a risk of imminent death or of a patient losing capacity to consent to an assisted death.\n\nPalliative sedation \u2014 a drug-induced coma \u2014 was offered, the doctor said, \"as that is permissible in a Covenant hospital.\" However, the patient did not want that, saying he instead wished to return to his farmstead for an assisted death.\n\n\"He was transferred to his farm via ambulance, with both myself and his physician hoping that he did not bleed out and die en route, which was a definite possibility,\" the doctor said.\n\nAfter the patient's assisted death, \"his physician was informed not to mention MAID at all in his discharge summary,\" the doctor said.\n\nThe doctor told Hoffman they could not understand how, as a publicly funded health provider, Covenant could refuse to allow patients to complete MAID paperwork, or undergo assessments, on their property.\n\nIn her response, Hoffman said the government \"respects the right of health-care professionals to conscientiously object\" to facilitating assisted deaths. She did not mention why her government decided the right to conscientiously object extends to health-care institutions.\n\nHoffman told the doctor she appreciated their feedback and had asked the AHS lead on MAID to contact them directly.\n\n\"While I appreciate your invitation to speak further, my schedule does not allow me to do so at this time,\" Hoffman said.\n\n\n\nIf someone you know has had a similar experience, or you have information about this issue, please contact us in confidence at cbcinvestigates@cbc.ca.\n\n\n\n@jennierussell_", "RCMP have arrested a Halifax-area teacher accused of assault and mischief after an Oct. 3 incident involving a student.\n\nDerek William Stephenson, an English teacher at Cole Harbour District High School, was arrested Nov. 9 and is scheduled to appear in Dartmouth provincial court on Dec. 12, RCMP said in a news release Tuesday. No charges have yet been laid.\n\nStephenson is currently on administrative leave and has voluntarily surrendered his teaching licence, the Halifax Regional Centre for Education said in a statement today.\n\n\"An altercation occurred when the man removed ear buds from a 15-year-old youth's ears,\" the RCMP release says. \"The youth then removed the man's lanyard that was attached to keys in his pants pocket. The man then pushed the youth into a wall, and put him on the floor.\"\n\nThe boy reported the incident to the school administration. He was then checked by emergency health services, but wasn't found to have any injuries.\n\nThe RCMP were called to the school and investigated.\n\nReached by phone on Tuesday, Stephenson declined comment.\n\n\"I have been instructed not to speak to the media,\" he said. \"Thank you very much.\"\n\nCriminal history known by administrators\n\nThe administration at the Halifax-area high school knew that Stephenson had a criminal history involving threats and domestic violence, and had vouched for his character with justice officials following at least one of his earlier encounters with the law.\n\nThe Oct. 3 incident happened in a classroom, and a four-second video recorded by another student has been circulating on the social media app Snapchat, where a man is seen kneeling and briefly putting a student in a choke hold.\n\nThe latest incident is raising questions about what Halifax-area education officials beyond the school knew of the criminal charges Stephenson previously faced while he was a teacher, and what measures, if any, were taken.\n\nThat past includes pleading guilty in October 2017 to threatening his ex-girlfriend, who is a teacher at another school, and a November 2013 guilty plea for assaulting his ex-wife, a case in which a charge of assaulting his daughter was withdrawn. In 2010, a woman also got an emergency protection order against him.\n\nDerek William Stephenson, an English teacher at Cole Harbour District High School, is shown in this 2012 image from a CBC story about a school rap performance. On Nov. 9, he was arrested and is scheduled to appear in Dartmouth provincial court next month following an altercation with a student in the classroom. (CBC)\n\nNancy Jakeman, a former member of the Halifax Regional School Board, said elected members were never told about those cases. It's something that now strikes her as an unsettling lack of transparency and accountability, given board members were typically informed when other teachers faced charges.\n\n\"It definitely bothers me,\" Jakeman said in an interview. \"It raises concerns. The fact that it wasn't brought forth to the board, I just don't agree with that, I think that it should have been.\"\n\nIt also doesn't sit well with the family of the 15-year-old student Stephenson is accused of assaulting. The student's older brother said in an interview that the teen told him the incident started after Stephenson ripped out the student's earphones.\n\nThe older brother, who is an adult and was not present, said his younger brother told him he then touched Stephenson's lanyard. The teacher began to taunt the teen, he said, and then \"charged at him and tackled him,\" shoving the boy against the wall.\n\n\"If you have somebody that has assault charges and then you let them work at the school and then they assault somebody again, that's really a bad decision on their part,\" the older brother said of school officials.\n\nCBC News has decided not to identify the student due to his age. The assault allegation has not been proven in court.\n\nWhile Stephenson has previously been found guilty of crimes, court documents and audio recordings of past court proceedings show how glowing references, including at least one from a school administrator, have helped him avoid a criminal record.\n\nIn 2013, Stephenson was arrested outside Cole Harbour District High School and charged with assaulting his now ex-wife and their daughter at a Dartmouth, N.S., home.\n\nHe pleaded guilty that November to assaulting his wife; the court was told he grabbed her by the hair and pushed her. He was handed 18 months of probation and ordered to attend an intimate partner violence prevention program.\n\nHe received a conditional discharge, which meant he had been found guilty but would not have a criminal record after three years so long as he completed probation without a problem.\n\nVice-principal part of 'glowing' report for court\n\nThe then vice-principal at Cole Harbour High, Barrett Khan, provided a character reference for Stephenson's pre-sentence report, describing his creative dedication to working with students on initiatives, including producing videos, spoken word, musicals and building a haunted house.\n\nStephenson was arrested outside Cole Harbour District High School in 2013 and charged with assaulting his now ex-wife and their daughter at a Dartmouth, N.S., home. (Craig Paisley/CBC)\n\nAt sentencing, Crown and defence lawyers agreed the pre-sentence report, especially Khan's reference, led them to a joint-recommendation of a conditional discharge, because the assault appeared to be out of character.\n\nDefence lawyer Geoff Newton highlighted to the judge Stephenson's work with students at the school and the \"glowing nature of the pre-sentence report,\" arguing he should not be sent to jail. Crown prosecutor Perry Borden noted the \"vice-principal at his school spoke very highly of him and his abilities.\"\n\nJudge Alana Murphy granted Stephenson the discharge. She ordered a DNA sample be taken from him.\n\nIn court again, 4 years later\n\nIn October 2017, Stephenson also received a conditional discharge for mischief and threatening his ex-girlfriend. A charge of assaulting her was withdrawn. He was put on probation, and ordered to take anger management courses and to stay away from his ex-girlfriend.\n\nFollowing his arrest on those charges, a fellow teacher at Cole Harbour, Peter Mahalik, acted as his surety to secure his release.\n\nThe Crown noted at sentencing a \"positive pre-sentence report.\" He said Stephenson had been candid about his anger management problems and had \"lost his temper in the course of a domestic dispute.\"\n\nDefence lawyer Michelle James said it was in her client's \"best interest to remain criminal-record free, given the nature of his employment.\"\n\nIn granting the conditional discharge, Judge Jean Whalen said: \"If you're asked whether you've been found guilty of a criminal offence you have to say yes because I have to find you guilty before I impose sentence. If you're asked do you have a criminal record, you can say no because a conditional discharge is not a criminal record. What anybody does with that information, I have no control over, Mr. Stephenson.\"\n\nSafety of students a priority: principal\n\nFollowing the incident at the school last month, students in the classroom went to the school's office to report what happened, the boy's brother said.\n\nIn a message sent home from the school on the day of the incident, principal Dunovan Kalberlah said the staff member has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\n\"The safety of our students is always a top priority,\" Kalberlah wrote.\n\nDoug Hadley, Halifax Regional Centre for Education spokesperson, would not speak to the incident or to Stephenson's employment history, describing it as a \"confidential, personnel matter.\"\n\nThe HRCE is responsible for administering the region's schools. It was created on April 1 after the provincial government dissolved all elected school boards in favour of an appointed advisory council.\n\nHadley would also not confirm if education officials received any reports about Stephenson's criminal history, or what action was taken in response.\n\n\"I can say that the HRCE takes any matter potentially impacting the safety and security of our students very seriously and we take all reasonable measures to ensure their safety is protected at all times while under our supervision,\" Hadley said in an email to CBC News last month.\n\nVolunteers need regular police checks\n\nSchool volunteers must clear a police background check and a check of the province's child abuse registry every three years, according to HRCE policy.\n\nHowever, teachers only require a background check when hired, unless they break service longer than three months during the school year, according to the HRCE student protection policy.\n\nStephenson would not have passed a criminal-record check and a vulnerable-sector check until three years after pleading guilty, according to Const. John MacLeod, a Halifax Regional Police spokesperson.\n\nAfter being hired, if a teacher is under a criminal investigation, it is their duty to report that to the HRCE, said Hadley. There is no specific HRCE policy stating which crimes would be grounds for dismissal.\n\n\"If an employee was convicted of a crime, our human resources department would investigate the details of the conviction to determine if there is impact to them as an employee,\" said Hadley.\n\n\"Every situation is unique, and there are many factors which are considered when determining whether a criminal conviction would impact a person as an employee of the HRCE.\"", "Musicians of the Midnight Sun is a new 10-part CBC radio series produced by northern musical icon Pat Braden.

They'll hold you hostage, but you won't find someone who operates that way and is licensed.\"\n\nCharged by different company\n\nThat's what happened to Shelly Litt.\n\nAfter calling a locksmith on Nov. 8, he showed up in an unmarked vehicle and drilled a $25 lock that she'd purchased at Walmart.\n\nHer mother had found the locksmith online and rates suggested it would cost no more than $75. But when it came time to pay, Litt was told it would cost $500.\n\n\"At this point, I was pretty uncomfortable and I wanted him to leave so I thought, 'OK, I'll just pay the ridiculous amount,'\" she said.\n\nIt's illegal for unlicensed locksmiths to carry picks and bypass tools.

According to the WRHA, the changes are in response to an anticipated funding drop from Veterans Affairs in 2019 to match the reduced number of veterans in care as they age and pass away, as well as a directive from the province to balance Deer Lodge's budget.\n\n\n\n\"I just wish that there could be a lot more people doing what the staff is doing here.

But recreation therapy is very important, he said, to get people out of their rooms, socializing, talking, being active and having fun.\n\n\n\n\"So the idea to essentially cut that in half for some of the units we're talking about here is remarkable. What are these residents going to do? Are they going to sit in their room and do nothing? Are they going to sit in the cafeteria and do nothing?

Scott said there are 10 recreation therapists at the centre, and plans are to reduce their hours, not eliminate their positions.\n\nA Second World War veteran and his wife living at Winnipeg's Deer Lodge Centre are worried about how upcoming cuts to recreation therapy programming, volunteer services and support staff will affect their quality of life. 1:05\n\n\"The individual veteran won't see a decrease in services, it's just overall; the numbers have decreased, so we're adjusting our budget and staffing to match,\" he said.\n\n\"We're confident that the individuals directly affected by this will have positions at Deer Lodge.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVeterans Affairs Canada provides $17.01 per day per veteran in supplemental funding to Deer Lodge to cover recreation therapy, spiritual care, end-of-life nursing care and food services, among other things.\n\nA spokesperson for Veterans Affairs Canada estimated a funding reduction of $112,000 for 2019, based on an anticipated 65 veterans living at Deer Lodge.\n\n\n\n\"Over the past three years, per diem funding provided by Veterans Affairs Canada to support special program and an enhanced level of service for veterans in care at the Deer Lodge Centre (beyond provincial funding) has increased,\" wrote Emily Gauthier, on behalf of Veterans Affairs Canada. She added the per-diem funding model was a change that occurred in 2015.\n\nScott said although the funding from Veterans Affairs has increased in the past few years, this is the first time the centre has adjusted its own staffing levels for the smaller number of veterans. He adds that staff salaries also go up each year, increasing costs.\n\n\"We need to change some of the practices that are done, some of the services and how they're delivered, to reflect that change,\" said Scott.\n\n\"The math isn't working for me,\" countered Moroz, who added there are no units at Deer Lodge Centre exclusively for veterans.\n\n\"If you're removing the recreation therapy services on a unit, or cutting them in half, how are those veterans on that unit not being affected by that cut? So there's something here that the WRHA is not exactly being forthright here.\"\n\nDeer Lodge Centre already made cuts to its nursing staff last year to align with provincial directive to find efficiencies in service.

(Robert Jones/CBC)\n\nBackyard power lines are often closer to larger trees and when they come down on a line during a storm, sometimes heavy equipment can't reach an area to quickly fix the problem.\n\nThis slows down restoration for everyone, according to Ross Galbraith, the business manager of the union that represents NB Power line workers.\n\nRoss Galbraith, business manager with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, believes backyard power lines slow down restoration for everyone. (http://rossgalbraith.com/ \u200b)\n\n\"Customers want the power in behind the house because it doesn't ruin the sight lines in front of their residence,\" he said.\n\n\"The issue is in behind homes it's hard to get at infrastructure to repair it or fix it when there is a power outage, and so that is slowing things down too.\"\n\nStrong winds knock out power\n\nDuring the major wind storm, NB Power said trees and branches fell onto many power lines, particularly in the Fredericton area. (Shane Fowler/CBC)\n\nAt the beginning of November, a severe wind storm caused widespread power outages across New Brunswick. At the peak of the storm, more than 100,000 NB Power customers were without electricity. It was the third worst blackout in the utility's history.\n\nAfter the storm, some NB Power customers were without electricity for nearly a week because accessing downed power lines behind homes is an ongoing problem.\n\n\"The trees in the back lot are what's causing the longest delays,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"There's no way to get a truck in there. There [are] fences that are built (by homeowners). It takes a long time.\"\n\nBut if back-lot power lines are a poor design that have been worsening outages, there's little evidence NB Power did much to stop them.\n\nExpanding rights-of-way\n\nWhen a major outage is underway, NB Power President Ga\u00ebtan Thomas, said crews shouldn't have to access downed lines in suburban neighbourhoods by foot. (CBC)\n\nAt hearings three years ago, Tony O'Hara, NB Power's vice-president of engineering, said the utility works closely with housing developers and those who want power lines in the backyards of their subdivisions, only had to ask for them.\n\n\"When we are building for a subdivision, NB Power lays out the format of how that subdivision would be serviced and sometimes that's based on the requests of the developer,\" said O'Hara.\n\n\"For example, they may be looking for some optional alternatives like underground or back-lot construction or standard front lot construction and based on that we would lay out the most efficient way of ensuring that we can provide service.\"\n\nIn Rothesay, most subdivisions have power lines running through backyards of homes, even those built more than 50 years ago.\n\nIn older neighbourhoods, like in the Highland Ave area in Rothesay, many of the residential rights-of-way are thick with large trees and underbrush.\n\nThomas said he is fed up with the utility having to access downed lines in suburban neighbourhoods by foot, when there is a major outage underway.\n\nHe plans to approach mayors with a plan to cut wider paths than the current six metre standard.\n\n\"I'm going to go further now because it is the second severe wind storm and we need to expand our right-of-ways,\" said Thomas.\n\n\"Twenty feet, which is a typical six-metre right-of-way, is really not enough for these kind of storms.\"", "City councillors are back at work and one of their first pieces of business may keep them at city hall well into the evening.\n\nOn Tuesday afernoon, council's Assiniboia community committee will consider a land-use plan that would make way for the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre, a 50-bed addictions treatment facility planned for the old Vimy Arena site on Hamilton Avenue in St. Charles.\n\nSupporters of the centre say Winnipeg desperately needs more addictions-treatment options and insist the centre will save lives. Opponents say it will have a negative effect on property values in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe format of the committee meeting is a public hearing, where proponents and opponents may address councillors. Dozens are expected, creating the likelihood of a hearing that runs well into Wednesday morning if it is not adjourned and reconvened at a later date.\n\nBefore the marathon begins, here's what Winnipeggers need to to know:\n\n1. The hearing does not involve the sale of Vimy Arena\n\nAt least not directly. City council approved the sale of Vimy Arena to the province for $1 back in January. The province intends to lease or sell the land to the Bruce Oake Memorial Foundation for the purpose of building the recovery centre.\n\nThat sale, however, is contingent upon the successful rezoning of the land, which is currently designated as parks and recreation space.\n\nWhat council's Assiniboia community committee will actually consider tonight is a plan to split the land into two pieces, rezone one of the new parcels for multi-family residential use and allow the addictions-treatment centre to operate on one of those new chunks.\n\n2. All councillors can consider is the proposed use of the land\n\nThere's no question \u2014 Winnipeggers who are passionate about the need for more long-term addictions treatment options will come out in force to speak in favour of the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre tonight. Likewise, opponents of the creation of this centre in a residential neighbourhood will be motivated just as passionately to speak out.\n\nBut councillors Scott Gillingham (St. James), Janice Lukes (Waverley West) and Kevin Klein (Charleswood-Tuxedo) won't be considering the pros and cons of addictions treatment in general.\n\nAll they can vote on is the specifics of the land-use plan, which calls for a three-acre parcel of recreation space to be split into two chunks, as well as a separate but related request to operate a rehabilitation centre on one of those parcels.\n\nOne of the proposed new chunks, about half an acre in size, would remain recreation space and will be incorporated into existing parkland along Sturgeon Creek. The other, 2.5-acre parcel would be rezoned as residential space.\n\nThat's where the 50-bed treatment centre would be built, in place of the existing, decommissioned Vimy Arena.\n\nThe Oakes are working to transform the site of the Vimy Arena in St. James into a 50-bed addiction treatment facility in their son's memory. (Laura Glowacki/CBC)\n\nThe plan calls for the rink to be demolished, except for the western third of the rink surface. If that can be salvaged, it will house a new gym. If it can't, a new gym will be built and incorporated into the addictions-treatment centre.\n\nThe centre itself won't offer detoxification services.\n\n\"All prospective residents must be clean and stabilized when starting their recovery journey at the Bruce Oake Recovery Centre,\" city planner Devin Clark says in a report to Assiniboia community committee.\n\nResidents at the centre must also observe a curfew and submit to mandatory drug testing.\n\n\"The Bruce Oake centre will only accept residents who choose treatment based on their own decision,\" Clark writes in the report.\n\n3. It will take 4 votes to approve the land-use changes\n\nEven if Assiniboia community committee votes in favour of the treatment centre, supporters have three more hurdles to clear at city hall.\n\nThe plan would then move over to council's property committee, which has the power to reverse community committee decisions. The plan also requires approval from council's executive policy committee and ultimately council as a whole.\n\nNot all of those bodies allow delegations to speak in favour of or against the plan. That's because tonight's vote takes place as part of a quasi-judicial hearing.\n\nBut that won't stop supporters and opponents of the plan from returning to city hall three more times.\n\n4. There is little opposition to this plan on city council\n\nThe loudest opposition to the addictions-treatment centre has, in the past, emanated from some residents in the Crestview area, independent Manitoba MLA Steven Fletcher and former city councillor Shawn Dobson, who represented the old St. Charles ward before it was dissolved in September.\n\nDobson's loss to Coun. Scott Gillingham in St. James in the election last month means only two opponents of the addictions-treatment centre remain on city council. Councillors Ross Eadie (Mynarski) and Jason Schreyer (Elmwood-East Kildonan) are the only sitting councillors who voted against the sale of Vimy Arena back in January.\n\nWhile this does not guarantee every other member of council will vote in favour of the treatment centre's plans, it does suggest the opposition doesn't have many allies at city hall.\n\nThat means even if treatment-centre opponents show up in large numbers this evening and ensure the hearing stretches into the wee hours of Wednesday morning, they are unlikely to gain much traction among councillors.\n\nMayor Brian Bowman has made the addictions-treatment centre a political priority and even some of his usual council critics \u2014 namely councillors Janice Lukes (Waverley West) and Jeff Browaty (North Kildonan) \u2014 are likely to support the plan.", "If mirrors could tell stories, one that sits in Noel Harding's new boxing club would have quite the story to tell.

And while he has lost members since the fire due to a lack of a permanent location, he's confident they'll come back.\n\nBeing downtown again was important because Harding wants to see the city's hub thrive. He said while it's disappointing the city denied him funding in exchange for free programming for youth, he's committed to helping them and others in the community regardless.

A judge eventually ordered that former owner Tracy Dodds pay the town $144,000.\n\nPlus, he said the boat was never in Bridgewater so he's not sure why it needs to be remembered there.\n\nMacNevin, the founder of an arts organization called International Current Art Research & Development Institute, has hired a lawyer who will make his case at a town council meeting Tuesday night.\n\nHe's been working on the sculpture for years, and said he spent a total of $900 on the bow, which includes the nameplate.\n\nMacNevin said he hasn't had a single complaint from his neighbours. In fact, he said most people who stop by to look at it seem intrigued.\n\nMitchell, meanwhile, has been hearing a different story. He said several people have called or shown up to town hall to register their displeasure.\n\nMaking a statement\n\nIt's hard to miss the sculpture in front of MacNevin's house on the corner of King Street and Jubilee Road. The rusting bow is pierced in the centre with a giant railroad spike.\n\nBut he insists it's not meant to be beautiful, just like a similar structure in Lunenburg \u2014 a piece of the Berlin wall that stands right beside the Lunenburg Foundry.\n\nMacNevin and his lawyer have appealed the town's order to remove the structure. They will argue their case at town council on Tuesday evening. (Submitted by Brian MacNevin)\n\nNeither are particularly pleasant to look at but both have a purpose \u2014 \"it's the memories that it contains and what it points to,\" said MacNevin.\n\nIf he loses his appeal to keep the sculpture, he said he still has options, including sending it to a former Sea Shepherd member in France who's interested.\n\n\"But that would be, like, unfortunate for me,\" he said, \"because I really think the Farley Mowat ship, it ended its life on the South Shore of Nova Scotia and Farley Mowat, the writer, wrote his books in Nova Scotia.

But it did not address the deeper issues that pushed Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers toward their latest violence and left doubts about international efforts to forge a broader truce.\n\nThose efforts had appeared to be making progress in recent days as Israel allowed Qatar to deliver financial aid to the cash-strapped Hamas government, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that he wanted to avert an \"unnecessary\" war in Gaza. Hamas, in turn, had scaled back its mass protests that have led to weekly bloodshed along the Israeli border.\n\nBut hours after Netanyahu spoke Sunday, an Israeli commando unit on an undercover mission was caught behind enemy lines in Gaza by Hamas militants.

And anguishing over whether you \u2014 or your child \u2014 need to go to the doctor. Maybe it's better to stay in bed \u2014 but what if it's strep throat and antibiotics are required?\n\nIn three Canadian provinces (B.C., Alberta and Nova Scotia), you can walk into some pharmacies and get a rapid \"point-of-care\" strep throat test.\n\nThe pharmacist takes a throat swab, and within a few minutes, tells you whether it tested positive or negative for group A streptococcus \u2014 the bacteria that cause strep throat.\n\nNow pharmacy owners want that test to be available across the country.\n\nIt's a quick and easy way, they say, to confirm whether a sore throat is caused by strep bacteria or by a virus.\n\nThat's important because only about a third of sore throats in children between five and 15 years old are caused by strep. The rest of the time it's usually a virus, in which case antibiotics won't do any good and shouldn't be prescribed.\n\nSo if the test comes back positive for strep, the pharmacist will advise you to go to the doctor and get the appropriate prescription. In Alberta, you could get the antibiotic right away, as pharmacists have prescribing authority in that province.\n\nIf the test comes back negative, \"you may just need fluid and rest, which a pharmacist could advise you on,\" said Sandra Hanna, vice-president of pharmacy affairs for the Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association of Canada and a pharmacist in the Toronto area.\n\n\"In the majority of cases, an antibiotic \u2026 would not be required, because it's a viral sore throat,\" she said.\n\nSince about two-thirds of sore throats are viral and antibiotics shouldn't be prescribed, ruling out strep infections in a pharmacy setting can help save patients unnecessary trips to the doctor's office, says Sandra Hanna, vice-president of pharmacy affairs for the Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association of Canada and a practising pharmacist. (Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association of Canada)\n\nThe test, which costs patients about $15, allows people \"to determine whether they need to go to the doctor or not,\" Hanna said.\n\nThat, in turn, could help prevent the unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions which contribute to antibiotic resistance, she said.\n\nFor all those reasons, the association, which represents pharmacies (including chains such as Shoppers Drug Mart and mass merchandisers with pharmacy services such as Costco and Walmart), says strep point-of-care testing should be available across the country, and is currently lobbying to start it in Ontario.\n\nSounds great, right?\n\nNot so fast, say infectious disease specialists.\n\nWhen it comes to kids, point-of-care tests (also called rapid antigen tests) shouldn't be used on their own to rule out strep throat, said Dr. Jeffrey Pernica, head of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont.\n\n\"These tests that they're talking about don't work well enough to be reliable in children. And children are the ones who are the most at risk from complications of strep throat, like rheumatic fever. And they're the ones who get strep throat the most,\" he said.\n\n(For adults, strep throat is less common.)\n\nWhen doctors suspect a patient has strep throat, they usually do a throat swab and send it off to a lab for a \"throat culture test,\" where the sample is left for a day or two to see if it grows into strep bacteria.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Pernica, head of the division of pediatric infectious disease at McMaster University, says he understands the appeal of rapid strep tests, but they shouldn't be used in isolation when it comes to ruling out strep throat in children. (McMaster University)\n\nThat's the \"gold standard diagnostic test\" for strep throat, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt's also the accepted medical guideline for treating strep throat in children, said Dr. Jonathan Gubbay, a Toronto pediatrician specializing in infectious disease, as well as a medical microbiologist for Public Health Ontario.\n\nGubbay actually uses a point-of-care test in his clinic when he suspects a child has strep throat because he can get the result back in five or 10 minutes. If it's positive, he can start antibiotic treatment right away.\n\n\n\nBut if it's negative, he sends a sample to the lab for the culture test to make sure the point-of-care test wasn't a false reading.\n\nIt's important to make sure a strep diagnosis isn't missed in children, Gubbay said, because although rare, it can progress into an invasive form of the disease or heighten the risk of rheumatic fever, which can damage the heart and joints.\n\n\"The sensitivity [of rapid tests] isn't as good as we'd like,\" he said.\n\nSo how reliable are they? It depends on who you ask.\n\nThe Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association says the point-of-care tests are accurate more than 90 per cent of the time. But both Gubbay and Pernica say that's unlikely.\n\nDr. Jonathan Gubbay, deputy chief of medical microbiology at Public Health Ontario and a pediatric infectious disease physician, says a comprehensive physical exam of a child with a sore throat can sometimes rule out strep throat without requiring a swab at all. (Public Health Ontario)\n\nAlthough studies that show such high accuracy do exist (including those cited by test manufacturers themselves), the doctors say a broader look at the research puts the number closer to 70 per cent.\n\nDr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta, also questions whether point-of-care tests are as accurate as they claim to be.\n\n\"There are lots of tests that are licensed and the packages always tell you that they're fantastic. In the real world, they vary a lot,\" she said.\n\nBoth Saxinger and Gubbay also point out that diagnosing strep goes beyond the throat swab \u2014 regardless of how the results are processed, because physicians and nurse practitioners do complete physical exams. In many cases, they're able to rule out strep throat without even doing a swab \u2014 a level of diagnosis they're not sure all pharmacists are equipped to provide.\n\nBut Hanna said in the provinces where point-of-care tests are in place, pharmacists do have comprehensive conversations with patients \u2014 and also guard against missed strep diagnoses.\n\n\"Tests that show a negative result in patients where the pharmacist strongly suspected them of having strep throat, based on their symptoms, were referred to a physician for further evaluation,\" she said.\n\nThe manufacturers of point-of-care tests, including those for strep throat, 'always tell you that they're fantastic.

It concluded the pharmacy-based treatment saved an average of $12.47 to $24.36 per patient.\n\nHowever, the study did not account for the fact that patients pay about $15 out-of-pocket for the strep test \u2014 and it was funded by Loblaw Companies Limited, which runs pharmacies and owns the Shoppers Drug Mart chain.\n\nThat raises questions for Pernica about how impartial the findings are.\n\n\"There's a clear incentive for the drug stores to get people [in],\" he said. \"Because if they have strep throat, they've done them a service. If they don't have strep throat, they're still there.

It's caused by the fact that urban building materials like asphalt, concrete and brick soak up more heat during the day than grass and trees, and release it in the late afternoon and evening, hiking temperatures around 2 C to 3 C at those times of day.\n\nThat means urban areas are warmer than rural areas even in the absence of climate change.\n\nKrayenhoff wanted to know what would happen if you added the urban heat island effect to climate change \u2014 would they add up as expected?\n\nHe and colleagues at Arizona State University, where he was previously a postdoctoral researcher, ran some simulations assuming that greenhouse gas emissions linked to climate change continue to rise as they have been rising. That's expected to boost temperatures an average of 4 or 5 C in U.S. cities by 2090 to 2099.\n\nA landscaper cuts the grass and plants on the Vancouver Convention Centre's six-acre green roof. Green roofs cool cities by collecting rainwater and using the sun's energy to evaporate the water instead of absorbing it as heat. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)\n\nThe simulations showed that temperatures did increase quite a bit, but about 0.5 C less than might be expected than if you simply added the climate change and urbanization warming.\n\n\"Compared to the actual effect of climate change or even the urban warming, this is a small cooling effect. But it's there,\" he said, adding that it's consistent with the findings of a previous global, but less detailed study.\n\nThat kind of effect hasn't yet been detected in the real world, he acknowledged, but he expects that people will now try to look for it. He's not sure exactly what causes it, but said it somehow has to do with less heat being stored during the day and released at night during a warmer future compared to what happens now.\n\nGreen roofs, building materials\n\nHe and his colleagues wondered whether it's possible to design urban areas to mitigate the heating from both effects. For example, roofs could be built with reflective materials that bounce solar energy back into space or covered in plants and soil that collect rainwater and use the sun's energy to evaporate the water instead of absorbing it as heat. And cities could plant more trees along streets to reduce the amount of heat stored by roads.\n\nThey found that if those measures were applied consistently across entire cities while cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce climate change, daytime temperatures could be kept in check.\n\nUnfortunately, when it came to nighttime temperatures, \"any of the strategies we tried and all of them in combination can't offset warming due to climate change and urban development,\" Krayenhoff said.\n\nThe only things that made a small difference to nighttime temperatures were green roofs, and switching from building materials like concrete, brick and asphalt to materials that don't absorb heat well, such as wood, adobe or artificial turf. But Krayenhoff said the researchers wouldn't necessarily promote the use of those materials yet, as they have other effects, such as boosting daytime temperatures.\n\nKrayenhoff said the take-home message is we need to do what we can to reduce emissions and therefore climate change.\n\nOtherwise, \"the impacts on simply livability and health and energy use could be very large, and no matter how well we design our cities, they might be to a certain degree very warm and therefore unhealthy.\"\n\nThe study was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Urban Water Innovation Network and Arizona State University.", "With Marvel Comics icon Stan Lee's passing at age 95, members of the comics community in southwestern Ontario are remembering him as someone who changed the industry.\n\nLee created a series of superheroes that have been loved for decades, like Spider-Man, Iron Man and the Hulk.\n\n\"He knew how to write great heroic characters that while they were flawed, they always strived to be the best that humanity can be,\" said Jason Fabok, a DC Comics artist living in Essex County, Ont.\n\nGrowing up, Fabok admired Spider-Man.

Many worry that paid donation would threaten the principles underlying our public system. But this needn't be the case.\n\nRight now, a private company called Canadian Plasma Resources (CPR) operates two clinics in Canada \u2014 one in Saskatchewan and one in New Brunswick \u2014 where they offer donors up to $50 in gift cards for their plasma. CPR has applied to Health Canada for licenses to open several more clinics.\n\nHowever, Senator Pamela Wallin has proposed a bill to put a stop to that. If passed, Bill S-252, the Voluntary Blood Donations Act, would mean a federal ban on donor compensation.\n\nMeeting national demand\n\nWe do not collect enough plasma in Canada to meet the needs of patients. Canadian Blood Services (CBS) collects both blood and plasma through unpaid donations, and while it collects enough for direct transfusions, it does not amass enough plasma for plasma-derived-medicinal-products (PDMPs), which treat many serious conditions, including immunological disorders.\n\nThat's why Canada imports 80 per cent of the plasma it needs for PDMPs from the United States, where donors are paid. This puts us in a precarious position, since U.S. clinics could decide to sell all their plasma to their other buyers. Plasma self-sufficiency is an important goal, and the only countries that have achieved it rely to some extent on paid donation.\n\nWallin is concerned that a paid donor system would exploit the vulnerable, including \"young people at universities who are always short of cash.\" But if students need books, and patients need PDMPs, what's wrong with a mutually beneficial arrangement? And if payment were truly exploitative, how could we justify buying plasma from paid American donors?\n\nWhile the tainted blood scandal had many causes, the compensation of Canadian donors wasn't one of them. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nWallin's more central defence of her proposed bill is that we shouldn't introduce a profit-motive into the blood system. She points to the recommendation against paid donation issued by the Krever Report in response to the tainted blood scandal of the 1980s, when 2,000 Canadians contracted HIV and more than 30,000 contacted Hepatitis C from tainted blood transfusions.\n\nThe thing is, while the scandal had many causes, the compensation of Canadian donors wasn't one of them. Canadian donors at the time were unpaid.\n\nWhen Wallin says that profit has no place in our blood system, she is more closely echoing the Romanow Report, which issued recommendations in 2002 regarding the ongoing sustainability of our public health system, for which it found widespread support across Canada. Vitally, it found a belief that profiting from health care is \"un-Canadian\" and offends Canadian values.\n\nAltruism is an important national value that is supposedly jeopardized by paid plasma donation. Payment is thought to incentivize people to do things out of self-interest rather than out of a concern for others, and so leads them, Wallin says, \"to do things for the wrong reasons.\"\n\nBut payment and altruism are not incompatible. Canadian doctors receive a wage for the work they do, and we don't assume that they care only for themselves rather than for the people they treat. We don't accuse them of practising medicine \"for the wrong reasons,\" or of jeopardizing Canadian values when they cash their paycheques.\n\nDistribution based on need\n\nThe introduction of profit into the blood system might threaten another Canadian value identified by the Romanow Report, that health care should be distributed based on need, not ability to pay.\n\nCBS collects plasma from donors and sells it to hospitals (or to pharmaceuticals to manufacture the PDMPs used by hospitals) for distribution to those in need. CPR does the same thing. Yes, it pays donors, but this happens on the collection side of things, and so doesn't affect distribution. And yes, it has a profit-motive. But so do our other medical suppliers, and this doesn't seem to offend Canadian values because it doesn't derail the distribution of care on the basis of need.\n\nWallin says, \"Canadian donors are not meant to be a revenue stream for private companies looking to make a profit.\" Her concern is that Canadian plasma should serve a more important goal than to line the pockets of private shareholders. And she is absolutely right about this.\n\nThe most important reason for paying donors is to increase and secure Canada's plasma supply. CPR wants to create profit for its shareholders, so it might sell the blood it collects here to a higher bidder abroad. CPR's profit-motive means it can't be counted on to increase Canada's plasma supply and this is a good reason for Health Canada to not license any more of its clinics.\n\nBut it isn't a good reason to support a ban on donor compensation. To increase and secure our plasma supply, compensation could be offered by a non-profit agency instead. Many not-for-profits \u2014 including our provincial health insurers \u2014 pay their providers. CBS should too.\n\nA non-profit system of donor compensation subject to public oversight would increase Canada's plasma supply without the risk of it going to the highest bidder. It could also enforce safety measures that can be more difficult to regulate when plasma comes from private clinics.\n\nWe shouldn't allow Canadian donors to become a revenue stream for private companies looking to make a profit. But this doesn't mean we can't compensate them. Bill S-252 would foreclose the important option of non-profit donor compensation, and that's why it should not become law.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

(Ints Kalnins/Reuters) \"It was associated with geek culture very quickly even though Google didn't want it to be,\" explains Isabel Pedersen, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Digital Life, Media and Culture, and has written a book about wearable technology.\n\nShe said Google's promotional campaign promised a sexy, exciting image for Glass users, but the product looked odd and appeared clumsy to use. It didn't take long to become the butt of jokes on late-night television, and was later mocked on an episode of The Simpsons.\n\nEven so, that failure didn't dampen the desire of other companies to win over consumers to a more streamlined way to connect with the digital world. None have broken through to the mass market, however.\n\n\"In terms of wearable computing and wearable technology, smartglasses are the Holy Grail,\" said Pedersen. \"Whatever company can get consumers to use and buy smartglasses will really make it.\"\n\nNot cheap\n\nGrant and his co-founders are all just 28 years old, and had previously caught the attention of the tech world when they released the Myo armband, a gesture recognition device that lets users control technology wirelessly, using muscle movements. The company now employs 450 people and has spent the last five years developing Focals, learning from the mistakes of bigger companies.\n\nThe Focals smartglasses are operated with a ring called 'the loop.' It works like a joy stick that users can move up, down and sideways. The button in the centre makes selections. (Rob Krbavac/CBC) \"Our everyday smartglasses product was designed to be a pair of eyewear first, and not a piece of technology first,\" explains Grant. \"And I think that's super important for something that you're going to wear every day, and it's going to be part of your identity and how you express yourself.\"\n\nThere are just three styles of Focals, but unlike the unusual space-age design of Google Glass, all look like regular eyeglasses. An in-store fitting is required to ensure the holographic projector lines up with the wearer's eyes.\n\nAt $1,299, the whole package isn't cheap.\n\nPrivacy issues\n\n\"They're selling it as a luxury item,\" said Pedersen, who has already ordered a pair of Focals. \"That means it's not going to be for 12-year-olds or 15-year-olds or maybe even people in their early 20s. I think they're looking for a customer between 35 and 65 who can afford it.\"\n\nShe also flags privacy issues as a potential stumbling block for Focals.\n\nIsabel Pederson, who teaches at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, has written a book about wearable technology. (Marc Baby/CBC) \"We live in a datasphere that is using our data as a commodity,\" she said. \"Focals' integration with large companies like Uber and Amazon presents the worry that there might be data implications. That's something about this new product that we don't understand yet.\"\n\nGrant acknowledges that his team opted not to add a camera to the smartglasses due to privacy issues. \"There's clear value from having a camera in smartglasses,\" he said. \"But there are also obviously a ton of privacy concerns and social implications.\"\n\nThe more immediate challenge for the company though, is how to convince the world that this is the next step in the evolution of consumer technology; a product that will allow them to keep their eyes up, looking at the world around them, even as they access the many useful functions of a smartphone.\n\n\"I think it's just a mistake to think that smartphones are the best we can do, and that if we want the value they offer we have to live with this tradeoff that we're going to be forever distracted. Why does that have to be the case and why can't we do better?\" asks Grant. \"I think we can.\"\n\nHe and his partners are betting tens of millions of investors' dollars, years of effort, and the very survival of an ambitious little Canadian company, on the belief that he's right.", "Canada's showpiece satellite project has been hit with another launch delay, five years after the first of three spacecraft was scheduled for orbit.\n\nThe RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is now set to be launched from a California air force base sometime between Feb. 18 and Feb. 24, 2019. It's the fifth such delay since the $1 billion project was hit with technical troubles and other problems.\n\nThe mission follows RADARSAT-1 (1995-2012) and RADARSAT-2 (2007-present), pioneering Canadian satellite projects that use synthetic aperture radar to observe the Earth's surface in fine detail, even through cloud cover and bad weather.\n\nTechnicians put the final touches on the second of three Radarsat Constellation Mission satellites at the MDA facility Thursday, June 21, 2018 in Montreal. (THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nThe RCM, a project first proposed to the federal cabinet in 2004, will use three identical satellites in polar orbits to provide coverage of 90 per cent of the planet, with the ability to show objects as small as one metre across. Their images will help safeguard the sovereignty of Canadian coastlines and the North, among other benefits.\n\nBut getting the project off the ground \u2014 literally \u2014 has been a challenge.\n\nIt was finally green-lit by cabinet in 2008, with a $600 million budget. The price tag quickly escalated and the initial launch date of 2014 for the first of the three satellites was pushed back.\n\nA fixed-price $706 million contract was signed in 2013 with MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (now MDA, a unit of U.S.-based Maxar Technologies) to build, assemble, launch and operate the trio of satellites for the first year.\n\nOwned by government\n\nThe contract, drawing on MDA's success with the first two RADARSATs, specified a launch date of July 17, 2018. MDA owns and operates RADARSAT-2, but the new RCM will be owned by the government of Canada, feeding surveillance data to the Canadian Forces and a dozen other government departments.\n\nNew costs are being picked up by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), adding another $300 million to the package, which has pushed the total cost to more than a billion dollars.\n\nThe current plan has the three identical satellites being launched together on a Falcon 9 rocket, built by Elon Musk's SpaceX, with a Swedish-built \"dispenser\" inserting them into orbits that will have the satellites circling the Earth roughly once every 90 minutes.\n\nBut thermal-vacuum testing in Montreal of the three MDA-delivered satellites late in 2017 showed a problem with No. 2.\n\n\"Such testing of the RCM satellite at the CSA's laboratory identified a problem with components \u2013 in one of the satellites \u2013 which send the data acquired by the satellite to the ground,\" says an internal document, obtained by CBC News under the Access to Information Act.\n\n\"The failed components were removed from the satellite and returned to MDA's supplier in Germany in early December.\"\n\nLaunch failure 'would results in major schedule delays (years) and a cost of $600 million or more' - Internal Canadian Space Agency report on the delayed RADARSAT Constellation Mission\n\nSpace Agency spokesperson Audrey Barbier said the faulty component was fixed, tested and reinstalled, and a new launch date at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California was set for sometime between Oct. 30 and Nov. 29, 2018.\n\nBut SpaceX saw one of its Falcon 9 rockets explode after launch in June 2015, triggering a delay and a growing backlog for launches since then. The corporation now says a Falcon 9 won't be able to get the RCM into orbit until sometime between Feb. 18 and Feb. 24, 2019.\n\nThe mission will then require another three to six months to make the satellites operational.\n\nThe delay, according to an internal government document, means the Canadian Space Agency will need to rely on less-comprehensive RADARSAT-2 data from MDA for much longer than expected, pushing the budget for that data to over $500 million, up from the original $446 million.\n\nThe design lifespan of RADARSAT-2 was seven years, and the spacecraft now is almost four years beyond its life expectancy, although it's still functional.\n\nAnother disaster with a Falcon 9 rocket, or a failure of the system that inserts the satellites into their 600-kilometre-high orbits, would be costly for the Canadian government.\n\nNo insurance\n\nOttawa has only once taken out insurance on a launch of Canadian space hardware \u2014 $80 million for RADARSAT-1 \u2014 and will have to eat any losses if the RCM project fails after liftoff.\n\nThe agency pegs the risk of failure at 5.5 per cent, given SpaceX's record to date, but the consequences would be severe for the project.\n\n\"Would result in major schedule delays (years) and a cost of $600 millions or more to build and launch three replacement spacecraft and/or acquire substitute data, if such data would be available,\" says a March 2018 briefing package on the risks, obtained under the Access to Information Act.\n\n\"Rebuilding would require at least 3 more, likely 4 years.\"\n\nAn illustration of the Radarsat-2 satellite orbiting the Earth. The satellite was designed to last seven years but is approaching its 11th year in space. Its imaging will be needed to fill in the gap caused by the delayed launch of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission.\n\nBarbier confirmed those numbers are still valid, adding that the \"knowledge and expertise gained while building the constellation would most certainly alleviate the process, and the infrastructure built to support the RCM would already be in place.\"\n\nShe added that the agency so far does not expect its costs \u2014 including the costs of its 50 RCM personnel \u2014 to rise because of the recent delays.\n\nThe new satellites are each designed to have a service life of seven years.\n\nFollow @DeanBeeby on Twitter", "The Grande Prairie, Alta., woman and a friend from the U.K. who were charged with vandalism for spray painting graffiti on an ancient wall in Thailand have avoided prison, but must pay fines.\n\nBrittney Schneider and Furlong Lee, of Liverpool, were arrested in Chiang Mai on Oct. 18.

As it turns out, those jobs will be split in two, with 25,000 in each new hub, along with another 5,000 jobs to a third city, Nashville, Tenn.\n\nSome people in Toronto's tech sector, however, say they were worried Amazon would be a very big fish in a small pond \u2014 capable of eating up much of the talent in the pool.\n\n\"We already have a significant talent shortage, and Canadian growth companies need the talent that multinationals like Amazon will consume,\" said Anthony Lacavera, the founder of Toronto-based Globalive, a company that helps entrepreneurs grow their startups through investment and partnerships, in an email.\n\nToronto's reputation as a tech hub is growing: it's thriving off of early investments in artificial intelligence and financial technology, a strong university research community, and an ecosystem that supports startups.\n\nAccording to commercial real estate and investment firm CBRE, for two years in a row Toronto has been North America's fastest growing tech market, adding 28,900 tech jobs last year, up 13.6 per cent from the year before.\n\nBut it's yet to be home to a Canadian-born Amazon equivalent.\n\nThe arrival of an 800-pound gorilla like Amazon would be more likely to squash Toronto's thriving ecosystem than help it grow, said Lacavera, who also founded his own startup in Toronto, WIND Mobile, which later sold for $1.3 billion US.\n\n\"Canada needs to build its own global winners and end the branch plant economy once and for all,\" Lacavera said.\n\nSelling Toronto\n\nStill, Toronto's bid laid out why it was \"ready to become the home for Amazon's HQ2.\" It promoted Toronto's strong, diverse and affordable talent, quality of life, competitive corporate tax rates, and the country's universal health care.\n\nWe know that health care costs are top of mind at the company. In January, Amazon teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan to create a new venture aimed at bringing down health care costs for its employees.\n\nBut health care wasn't the only sales pitch. Organizers touted what Toronto had to offer by bringing together multiple different perks from different places in and around the region.\n\nThe city's pitch had the backing of nearby cities such as Hamilton, the tech hub of Kitchener-Waterloo and many more to tout the abundance of high skilled workers \u2014 all of whom could be hired for far less than American workers paid in U.S. dollars would demand.\n\nToronto's bid had the backing of other nearby cities that, collectively, are home to almost 8 million people across the region.

But according to Stanford economics professor Roger Noll, it's never worth it.\n\n\"In terms of local economic activity, there's essentially zero benefit,\" said Noll.\n\nThe Amazon case is more complicated though, because unlike a sports franchise, Amazon will derive most of its revenue from outside the chosen city and attract a high-end labour force that pays more taxes and spends money locally.\n\n\"It's probably better for a community to buy Amazon, than a basketball team \u2026 but it's still a huge amount of money to pay and extremely unlikely to be worth it,\" Noll said.\n\nToronto likely would've needed to match the other cities' massive incentives in order to win, which would've been a bad deal for the city, he said.\n\n\"It's never worth multiple billions, and Toronto should be proud of itself that it didn't win this.\"\n\nToronto's consolation prize\n\nLast week, Toronto Mayor John Tory said the city already got its payoff for its Amazon bid: the proposal it posted online has been downloaded more than 17,000 times.\n\n\"The other 16,999 that read that book beyond Amazon are people that today are making decisions about coming to Toronto\u2026. This city is a beacon for investment, for people, for companies,\" Tory told reporters.\n\nOn Tuesday, the mayor added that Toronto's bid organizers are still in contact with the company and are \"pursuing follow-up opportunities,\" with Amazon that could lead to more investment down the line.\n\nEarlier today I was asked about the recent reports around <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Amazon</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HQ2?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HQ2</a> and the Toronto Region's bid for the headquarters.

Sidewalk Labs is a sister company to Google.\n\n\"We could have a Google HQ2,\" said Florida. \"People don't think of that.\"\n\nIf the Sidewalk Labs project is able to address concerns over data privacy and other issues that come up in public consultations, Florida is optimistic that it would benefit Toronto more than an Amazon headquarters.\n\n\"For Toronto's sake, I think it's better it ended up this way,\" said Florida", "Amazon, which is growing too big for its Seattle hometown, is spreading out to the East Coast.\n\nThe online shopping giant ended its 14-month-long competition for a second headquarters Tuesday by selecting New York and Arlington, Virginia, as the joint winners. The two cities will each get 25,000 jobs that pay an average of $150,000 US.\n\nBut they'll pay for it: New York is forking over more than $1.5 billion in tax credits and other incentives, while Arlington is offering about a third of that \u2014 $573 million. The communities hope that Amazon will attract other companies and ultimately boost their economies.\n\nAmazon, which started as an online bookstore two decades ago, has grown to a behemoth that had nearly $180 billion US in revenue last year. It now owns well-known brands including grocer Whole Foods and online shoe-seller Zappos. It also makes movies and TV shows, runs an advertising business and offers cloud computing services to corporations and government agencies.\n\nThe company has more than 610,000 employees worldwide, making it the second largest U.S.-based, publicly-traded employer behind Walmart.\n\nBut it was the prospect of 50,000 jobs that led 238 communities across North America to pitch Amazon on why they should be home to the next headquarters.\n\nAmazon could have picked a struggling smaller American city desperate for new jobs, or even the Canadian city of Toronto, which made the company's final cut list of 20 possible locations. But instead it went with two of the nation's largest and most powerful metro areas. The reason Amazon gave: they are best suited to attract the high-skilled workers the company wants.\n\nNew York is the nation's financial and media powerhouse and has been working to attract technology companies. Google already has more than 7,000 workers in the city and, according to media reports, is looking to add 12,000 more in coming years.\n\nArlington is directly across the Potomac River from Washington. Many large government contractors have offices and lobbying operations there. However, many of its 1980s-era office buildings have vacancies after thousands of federal employees moved elsewhere. Being near the nation's capital could help Amazon with lobbying efforts as the company faces rising scrutiny from politicians.\n\nAmazon said it will spend $5 billion US of its own money between both locations on construction and other projects.\n\nThe new outposts won't appear overnight. Amazon said hiring at the two headquarters will start next year, but it could take a decade or more to build out its offices.\n\nIts New York location will be in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, while its Virginia offices will be in a part of Arlington that local politicians and Amazon are calling National Landing, a made-up area around Reagan National Airport that encompasses Crystal City and Potomac Yard.\n\nBoth are waterfront communities away from overcrowded business districts, giving Amazon space to grow.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Adam Ebbin, a Democrat who represents the area where Amazon's new headquarters will be located, said that affordable housing may be an issue, but the announcement is a welcome development that will help increase the area's tax base to help ease overcrowding in schools and address other pressing needs.\n\nNot everyone was pleased.\n\n\"Offering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong,\" said New York State Sen. Michael Gianaris and New York City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, Democrats who represent the Long Island City area, in a joint statement.\n\nAmazon said it will refer to the new locations as headquarters, even though with 25,000 jobs each, they would have fewer workers than its Seattle hometown , which houses more than 45,000 employees.\n\nSeattle will remain as one of Amazon's three headquarters, and the company said that senior executives will also be based in the two new locations. It plans to hold company-wide events at the new locations, including meetings of its shareholders.\n\nThere were early signs that Amazon had its sights set on New York and northern Virginia. Among its 20 finalists, the company had selected two locations in the New York metro area and three in the D.C. area. Plus, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos has a home in Washington D.C., and he personally owns The Washington Post.\n\nWhile it didn't win the main prize, Nashville, Tennessee, won't go empty handed. Amazon said the city, which was one of finalists, will be home to a new Amazon office that will create 5,000 jobs, focusing on customer delivery.", "A former Winnipegger who is one of hundreds of retired players suing the National Hockey League said he's happy \u2014 if surprised \u2014 about a tentative, $18.9 million deal between the two groups announced on Monday.\n\n\"I was quite surprised, actually,\" said Grant Ledyard, an 18-year veteran of the NHL who joined the lawsuit in 2016.\n\n\"Because the last word that I had gotten was that the lawsuit had been put to the side and would be revisited at another time, and it was just not going anywhere.\"\n\nMore than 300 retired players added their names to a lawsuit against the NHL between November 2013 and August 2018, suing the league for failing to protect them from head injuries or warn them of the risks involved with playing. One-hundred forty-six of them were listed as plaintiffs and 172 joined as claimants.\n\nOn Monday, the league announced a tentative $18.9 million US settlement with the players. The league did not, however, acknowledge any liability for the players' claims. Players have 75 days to opt into the settlement, and the league can terminate the deal if all 318 players or their estates don't elect to participate.\n\nEach player who opts in would receive $22,000 and neurological testing and assessment paid for by the league. If they test positive on two or more tests, they will be eligible for up to $75,000 in medical treatment.\n\nThe settlement would also include a \"Common Good Fund\" for retired players in need, including those who did not participate in the litigation, worth $2.5 million. That's the part Ledyard said he found the most interesting.\n\n\"I'm happy. I mean, me personally, I wasn't looking for money,\" Ledyard said on Monday on the phone from the Buffalo, NY, area.\n\n\"I think that's exciting. If we can help someone, then let's help some of the older guys. \u2026Some guys are having trouble and we need the NHL's help.\"\n\nSettlement figure much lower than NFL amount not surprising: prof\n\nDuring 1,028 games in the NHL, Ledyard said he got four or five documented concussions, but he estimates the actual number could have been more than double that. As a result, following his retirement in 2002, Ledyard said he's lived with daily headaches and has experienced depression, among other symptoms.\n\n\"It's been difficult at times. But I'm not too bad. I know other guys are worse than I am,\" he said. \"I'm there to help them whenever they need it.\"\n\nThe NHL's tentative settlement is a fraction of the roughly billion-dollar settlement reached between the NFL and its former players on head injuries. Ledyard said he's optimistic about the proposed settlement regardless.\n\n\"This is a tricky one, and I know because they saw what happened in the NFL and the multi-million dollar, billion dollar settlement or whatever it was that the players got. I think the NHL understands that they can't financially take that whack,\" he said.\n\n\"They played it close to the vest, but \u2026 this is an indication that they're willing to work with the players and retired players, and I think it's a huge step forward.\"\n\nCommissioner Gary Bettman and the NHL reached a tentative settlement in its concussion lawsuit with former players on Monday. (Ross D. Franklin/The Associated Press)\n\nDean Kriellaars, an associate professor at the University of Manitoba's Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, said the much-lower amount was predictable.\n\n\"I was not surprised that the value was so low, and far, far, far less than the NFL circumstance, because this is really a corporate action plan that has to be laid out to prevent the massive payouts that were done in the NFL,\" he said.\n\nHe's also not surprised the NHL still hasn't acknowledged liability for players' injuries.\n\n\"Those individual lawsuits can be in the tens of millions of dollars \u2014 hundreds of millions, perhaps,\" he said. \"So the game becomes, can we get a large number of the players out now with a voluntary settlement as opposed to claiming liability, which would be tested in the courts like it did for the NFL and then having to pay out very much larger sums.\"\n\nTwenty-thousand dollars per person may be acceptable for former players who aren't suffering financially as a result of their injuries, Kriellaars said.\n\n\"But if I'm a person who has lost reliable or gainful employment, that's really not a valid sort of proposal,\" he said.\n\n\"People who have substantial [symptoms], that's really nothing in the face of what they've put themselves, put their bodies through.\"\n\nLeague hasn't done enough to curb injuries: prof\n\nKriellaars said the lack of NHL acknowledgement of liability for injuries sends an \"us against them\" message to players.\n\n\"I think this sort of approach indicates to the players \u2026 that they are commodities as opposed to assets,\" he said. \"And I think that messaging is very, very dangerous.\"\n\nHe said the league has not done enough to treat existing head injuries, nor has it done enough to prevent more of them. Some junior hockey, Triple-A and international leagues have taken steps including tightening refereeing and implementing policies and regulations to prevent bare-knuckle fights and hits designed to \"take out\" other players.\n\n\"They need to put in money both in the prevention side and the treatment side,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the NHL can take some advice from the leagues that feed it and implement some more severe penalty rules so that they curb this sort of behaviour.\"", "Union negotiators say there was little progress during the 2\u00bd\u200b weeks that a special mediator was assigned to the Canada Post labour dispute.\n\nThe lack of a breakthrough means rotating strikes will resume Tuesday at different locations across the country, even though both sides have agreed to continue bargaining, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers said Monday.

Replacement follows staff patrols and resident requests, he added.\n\nHolmes said the \"approximate average bid price\" for the supply and installation of removable tubular bollards is $150.\n\nFull inspection of the bollards is done at least twice a year, usually in the spring so that infrastructure in the city is in its best condition for the start of cycling season and in the fall just before winter begins, he said.\n\n\"Winter replacements can be a challenge with snow accumulation, so damaged bollards are often removed if they have become a concern and the replacement installed when weather permits or during the spring cleanup,\" Holmes added.\n\nNot all cyclists agree with call for concrete barriers\n\nAndrew Leinonen said the more infrastructure there is close to the bike lanes, the less freedom there is for riders to take their own precautions.\n\nToronto cyclists are happy to have bike lanes, but an advocacy group says when protective barriers are broken, drivers use the lanes as temporary parking spaces.

Gian-Carlo Carra said landing the Games will give Calgary leverage to go after money for other projects.\n\nThose projects would complement that event.\n\nHis list of other projects includes an arena to replace the Saddledome, an LRT connection to the airport, a passenger rail line to the Rockies, and renovations to Arts Commons and Olympic Plaza.\n\nBut it all starts with voting for the Olympics in the plebisicite, keeping Calgary's chances of being named host city for the 2026 Olympics and Paralympics alive.\n\n\"This actually, I believe, leverages our ability to go after more money. We can say 'the Olympics are coming and we also need these things' and we can go after that money as well,\" said Carra in the video.\n\nWhen asked if that's realistic, Carra said eight years is a long time.\n\n\"If the world is coming to Calgary in 2026 for the Games, that ultimately will help us make the cases for the things we need to build,\" said the councillor.\n\n\"It will help us continue to be a serious net source of revenue for Alberta and Canada.\"\n\nOthers don't like Calgary's chances\n\nOther members of council are skeptical the federal and provincial governments will welcome more funding requests from Calgary.\n\nCoun.

She's pushing for council to prioritize its list of major projects before looking for money from Edmonton and Ottawa.\n\n\"To think that hosting the Olympics will get us leveraging to unlock more capital is perhaps a little bit naive,\" said Gondek.\n\nShe wants council to figure out sooner rather than later what it can or cannot afford to invest in, especially if Calgarians support an Olympic bid.\n\nThat potential bid requires $390 million from city hall.\n\nIf I were the different levels of government, I'd tell them to pound sand. - Coun.

The Bombers were not penalized, and the commissioner issued a statement after the game saying it was \"clearly a missed call\" due to the on-field referee's view being blocked, and suggested it was time to explore the idea of allowing the Command Centre to make the call on such plays.\n\nA statement from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CFL</a> Commissioner Randy Ambrosie: <a href=\"https://t.co/YIwhEnrfET\">pic.twitter.com/YIwhEnrfET</a> \u2014@CFLFootballOps\n\nAny potential changes to the current setup would come after the post-season at the earliest, but the wheels appear to be in motion.\n\n\"If I thought I had it nailed by Friday, I would do it but I think it's going to take more time than that,\" Ambrosie said. \"This is an important item. That's why I'm going to have a separate discussion with the governors [Tuesday], just to take their temperature on where they stand on this because I think that consulting them is another important part of a good, healthy process.\"\n\nMissed opportunity\n\nBridge stayed motionless on the turf for a few minutes before walking off under his own strength.\n\nThe incident came a week after Saskatchewan quarterback Zach Collaros took a late hit in the Riders' regular-season finale against the B.C. Lions. Collaros practised last week but wasn't healthy enough to play on Sunday.\n\nThe CFL's rules committee would need to approve any potential changes and the board of governors would have to provide final ratification.\n\n\"I saw last night an opportunity, that had our referee with the benefit of immediate, five different views, we could have made that call and dealt with it,\" Ambrosie said. \"I'm kind of leaning that way but I want to make sure we're thorough and thoughtful with all of our teams and football guys to make sure that if we're going to make a change that we do it together.\"\n\nWith the 23-18 victory, the Blue Bombers advanced to Sunday's West final against the Stampeders in Calgary. The Ottawa Redblacks will host the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the East final.\n\nThe Winnipeg Blue Bombers hung on to slay the Saskatchewan Roughriders 23-18 in the West Division semifinal. 2:16\n\nThe Grey Cup is set for Nov. 25 at Edmonton."]
