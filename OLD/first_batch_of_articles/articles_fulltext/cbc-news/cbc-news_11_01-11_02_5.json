(Sumbmitted/The Nature Conservancy of Canada)\n\nThe isthmus is a narrow, 23-kilometre strip of land joining mainland Nova Scotia to New Brunswick and the rest of the continent. Springhill and Oxford N.S., are to the east, and Shediac, Dieppe and Moncton N.B., are to the west.\n\nIn the past two years, Casey said a causeway was discovered that was part of a road running from Beaubassin, on the southwestern edge of Fort Lawrence, N.S., to Fort Gaspareaux, near Baie Verte, N.B., at the north end of the isthmus.\n\n\"It's interesting that the isthmus used to be a transportation link \u2026 north and south between the Bay of Fundy and the Northumberland Strait.\"\n\nThe Acadians on the Bay of Fundy would bring their goods and services to Beaubassin and ship it across an inland road to Fort Gaspareaux and then it would go on to Quebec, he said.\n\nFor years, Nova Scotia MP Bill Casey wanted to focus more attention and resources on the Chignecto Isthmus connecting his province with ours. It's home to four national historic sites: Beaubassin, Fort Beaus\u00e9jour-Fort Cumberland, Fort Gaspareaux and Fort Lawrence. Now Parks Canada has developed a new management plan for the area, focusing on connecting the sites. 8:04\n\nA total of 53 foundations of the village of Beaubassin, which was burned down in 1750, have now been unearthed, along with about 7,000 artifacts, said Casey.\n\n\"That is probably the most intact Acadian village on the planet,\" he said. \"And they still have much of the dig to go,\" he added, noting the side of the village where Indigenous people lived hasn't even been touched yet.\n\nA Mi'kmaq community and trade hub existed in the region long before it became an area of strategic interest for competing European powers.\n\nParks Canada is preparing a travelling museum about Beaubassin to help raise awareness about the important role it played as a transportation link and as an Acadian community, said Casey.\n\nEarlier this year, Stephen White, a genealogist at the University of Moncton, found Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's \"great, great, great, great, great grandfather was baptized at the church in Beaubassin\u200b on May 22, 1740,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of people have roots back to Beaubassin\u200b.\"\n\nHopes to see hiking trail\n\nCasey hopes to see Beaubassin and Fort Beaus\u00e9jour physically joined by a hiking trail replicating the route of the Acadians when they left Beaubassin in 1750 and marched across the valley and established Fort Beaus\u00e9jour\u200b.\n\n\"You can stand on one ridge and look across and see the buildings at the other community,\" he said. \"That may be the only place where two national historic sites are joined and they should be joined because it's all one story.\"\n\n\"So I'm hopeful we can get that put together and I'm quite confident it will happen.\"\n\nThe Parks Canada plan also calls for building relationships and new approaches so Indigenous peoples can tell their own stories and so local stakeholders can help contribute to the sites' protection and to the presentation of programs.\n\nThe third key strategy is to improve the management, protection and presentation of the Chignecto Isthmus National Historic Sites' cultural and natural resources by mitigating threats through best management practices.", "Several Indigenous communities north of Fort McMurray are undergoing a monumental shift in their relationships with the oilsands industry.\n\nFort Chipewyan's Indigenous leaders, who once partnered with environmentalists and hosted Hollywood stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Jane Fonda, have now signed deals with industry.\n\nLast month, the Athabasca Chipewyan and Mikisew Cree First Nations joined 12 other Indigenous groups in signing participation agreements with Teck Resources, which is developing the $20.6 billion Frontier Mine.\n\nCBC News travelled to Fort Chipewyan to speak to the Dene, Cree and M\u00e9tis communities about the mine.\n\nWatch the mini-documentary above to hear how community members are grappling with the new direction the community is taking.\n\nThe Frontier Mine is under review by the Alberta Energy Regulator and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\nConnect with David Thurton, CBC's Fort McMurray correspondent, on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or email him at david.thurton@cbc.ca", "Quebec Finance Minister \u00c9ric Girard is beginning his mandate with a $3-billion surplus, but he says it's too soon to commit to how that money will be spent.\n\nHe declined to go as far as Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault, who had suggested the surplus might be returned to Quebec taxpayers by the end of the year.\n\nGirard cautioned that, with interest rates rising, next year's financial picture may not be so rosy.

For a wheelchair user like Flores, even an issue like lengthy waits to replace a wheelchair cushion is worth exploring.\n\n\"The role is simply a voice for our community,\" he said. \"As an advocate, I need to hear what their experiences are and put forth recommendations to the decision makers to say these are the challenges and these are the issues that need change.\"\n\n'I think we can do much better'\n\nFlores was just one-year-old when he got polio.

So CBC News tried to find out if under-staffing contributed to the delays, which officials are blaming on unexpectedly high demand.\n\nNeither the finance minister nor the Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS) will say how many people are working at the warehouse or for this Crown corporation overall.\n\n\"I know that there continue to be some issues [with shipments] but I'm very confident actually that the Ontario Cannabis Store is working through these, it's a brand new business,\" said Finance Minister Vic Fedeli\n\nAsked for staffing numbers, Fedeli said the question would have to go to OCS.\n\nThis image supplied by the OCS shows the store's distribution centre.

I put in a lot of work and I'm happy I was able to play a game.\"\n\nReturning from a knee injury that sidelined him since the season opener, the 39-year-old Luongo stopped 32 shots to help Florida beat the Winnipeg Jets 4-2 on Friday night for a two-game split in the Finnish capital.\n\n\"That was huge for us,\" Florida coach Bob Boughner said. \"Watching him play so composed after being off for a month, he is a big reason why we won the game tonight.\"\n\nLuongo was hurt Oct. 6 against Tampa Bay.\n\nLuongo stopped all 17 shots in the final period as the Jets pressed.\n\nWatch highlights from Florida's win:\n\nThe Florida Panthers beat the Winnipeg Jets 4-2 to split the NHL Global Series in Helsinki with a win apiece. 2:17\n\n\"He gives us a lot of confidence and he's telling us what to do, talks a lot on the ice and off the ice,\" said captain Aleksander Barkov, who is Finnish.\n\nKeith Yandle and Evgeni Dadonov had a goal and an assist each for the Panthers. Mike Hoffman and Frank Vatrano also scored a goal apiece and Jonathan Huberdeau added two assists. The Panthers overcame an early 2-1 deficit for their first regulation victory and third overall win in the first 11 games.\n\n\"Our start wasn't very good, actually it was pretty awful, our start,\" Boughner said. \"They tested him (Luongo) early and he was really good and I think that gave us time to get feet underneath of us and start rolling a little bit. That's what good goalies do, they make the saves at the right time.\"\n\nComing off a hat trick Thursday night in Winnipeg's 4-2 victory, Finnish star Patrik Laine scored again In front of a capacity crowd of 13,500 at Hartwall Arena. Nikolaj Ehlers also connected, and captain Blake Wheeler had two assists.\n\n\"Overall, it's been an unreal trip,\" Laine said. \"I'm going to remember every second that we spent here for the rest of my life. The atmosphere at the ring was unreal for the both games.

He's eager to prove the doubters wrong while wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform.\n\nThe ace agreed to a $93 million, three-year contract Friday after initially opting out of his previous deal and choosing free agency.\n\n\"There's been a lot of people saying that I'm in decline or not going to be as good as I once was,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to proving a lot of people wrong with that.\"\n\nKershaw opted out of a $215 million, seven-year contract that had two seasons remaining at a total of $65 million. Signed in January 2014, it called for salaries of $32 million next year and $33 million in 2020.\n\nThe new deal involves a $23 million signing bonus, payable in equal installments on June 30 in each of the next three years, and annual salaries of $23,333,333.\n\n\"I wanted to stay here, so financial, everything aside, it was more valuable to me to just stay here,\" he said.\n\nAlso Friday, the Dodgers made $17.9 million qualifying offers to two of their other free agents: pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu and catcher Yasmani Grandal.\n\nKershaw gets an additional $28 million in guaranteed money. The new agreement includes $4 million annually in performance bonuses, in four $1 million increments for 24, 26, 28 and 30 games started, which could raise the deal's value to $105 million over three years.\n\nSports trophies take a beating:\n\nThe World Series trophy needed some repairs this week, but Rob Pizzo show us why this is nothing new. 1:54\n\nThe left-hander also can earn award bonuses of $1.5 million for winning the NL Cy Young Award or $500,000 for finishing second or third in the voting.\n\nKershaw, his wife Ellen and their two young children make their off-season home in the Dallas area, and if the Texas Rangers had had a winning season \"it would have been something to consider for sure,\" he said.\n\n\"It really wasn't as much of a question for me this time around,\" he said. \"My kiddos love it here. Ellen loves it here. I love it here. I love the team here, and there's not many opportunities that meet all the criteria that Ellen and I would be looking for. And myself personally, a chance to win every single year, it doesn't come around like this in LA very often.\"\n\nThe money designated a signing bonus will not be subject to state income because Texas does not have a state income tax.\n\nWinner of the NL Cy Young in 2011, '13 and '14, Kershaw was limited to 26 starts this year because of a back injury and went 9-5 with a 2.73 ERA while striking out 155. The Dodgers lost in the World Series for the second straight season, with Kershaw taking the loss in Sunday's season-ending Game 5 defeat to Boston. His average fastball velocity dropped by 2 mph in the past year to 91 mph.\n\n\"I plan on getting back to that level that I was at,\" he said. \"There's a lot of guys older than me, and there's a lot of guys with more innings than me in the big leagues that are still maintaining their velocity.\"\n\nA herniated disk in his back sidelined him in 2016. He had a less significant back problem this year and a shoulder issue.\n\n\"No more DL time,\" he said. \"From there, hopefully the getting people out thing will take care of itself.\"\n\nAt 30, Kershaw has experienced a fastball velocity decrease, and he missed time this season because of two stints on the disabled.\n\n\"While I did have a little bit of a back issue this year, it wasn't very significant. I missed more time this year because of the shoulder,\" he said. \"I really believe that for three years I can be just as good as I ever have been. And I'm not saying I can't be good past that. But that's as long as I was willing to commit to right now.\"\n\nKershaw remains the face of the franchise and his dedicated work habits have filtered down to the younger pitchers on the staff.\n\n\"He's made as much of an impact as you can on an organization in terms of the success we've had,\" Andrew Friedman, president of baseball operations, said Thursday.\n\nKershaw has a career 153-69 regular-season record with a 2.39 ERA in 318 games but it's in the post-season where his numbers drop. He's 9-10 with a 4.32 ERA. He gave up four runs in seven innings in Game 5 of the World Series.\n\n\"Winning is still the most important thing for me,\" he said.", "Former Liberal cabinet minister John Manley says the Trudeau government has not put enough emphasis on efforts to help private sector companies grow.\n\n\"What Canada needs is more businesses that can scale up and become global,\" said Manley in an interview with CBC News Network's Power & Politics that aired today. \"We have a big problem\"\n\nManley, the former president of the Business Council of Canada, said Canada has a good number of start-up companies but struggles to help those businesses expand.\n\nOne reason for this, said Manley, is that business is not a key focus of the current federal government.\n\n\"The Trudeau government [is] obviously very strong on Indigenous reconciliation, lots of good work on LGBTQ issues, on gender balance, all of which are good things,\" he told host Vassy Kapelos. \"They kind of, so far at least, left business out of their messaging and deliberations.\"\n\nNAFTA 2.0 or NAFTA minus?\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland arrive to hold a press conference regarding the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) at the National Press Theatre, in Ottawa on Monday, Oct. 1, 2018. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nManley left his post as the president of the Business Council of Canada just weeks after the Canadian government reached a new trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico. As head of the group representing more than 100 CEOs and entrepreneurs across the country, Manley paid close attention to the trade negotiations.\n\nHe said he breathed a sigh of relief when Canada secured an agreement \u2014 but he's still not happy with the deal.\n\n\"I resist calling it NAFTA 2.0. It's really NAFTA minus,\" he said.\"We agreed to some stuff in the USMCA that I regret deeply ... On the other hand, we got an agreement.\"\n\nManley said it's \"inexcusable\" that U.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel remain in place and suggested Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could have used that trade dispute with the U.S. to his political advantage.\n\n\"I think the prime minister chose country over party,\" he said. \"I think he could have walked from that agreement and called an election and probably won a pretty comfortable majority by running against Donald Trump.\"\n\nA change in political climate\n\nUnder the watchfull eye of Prime Minister Jean Chretien (right), Finance Minister John Manley makes a point in the House of Commons on Wednesday October 29, 2003. (CP PHOTO/Fred Chartrand) (Canadian Press)\n\nManley had a long career in politics serving in several cabinet posts, including Foreign Affairs and Finance. He said he regrets the way politics has changed since he left Parliament Hill.\n\n\"There was a time when our political opponents were not enemies. They were political adversaries and we could engage them in reasonable debate, not disparaging them, not mocking them, but trying to respond in a serious way,\" he said.\n\n\"Something's gone haywire.\"\n\n\n\nManley said he doesn't regret his time in office, but he thinks the political climate has become so partisan that he would not encourage his kids to run for office now.\n\n\"It always cost a lot in terms of your personal life and your home life, but now it costs everything,\" he said.", "He might be best known for co-creating Kim's Convenience but there is so much more to Ins Choi, including an accidental name change involving an immigration official when he moved to Canada.\n\nChoi shared that story and a lot more with The Homestretch.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length. You can listen to the complete interview here.\n\nQ: What is the story behind your name when you moved to Canada from Korea?\n\nA: The closest English spelling would have originally been Insub Cheh. I don't know who was working at Immigration Canada that day, but they heard and wrote Insurp Choi.\n\nThey stuck an R in the middle of my name. The R sound doesn't even exist in the Korean alphabet. I was anchored, burdened by the name Insurp for most of my life.\n\nI didn't like it. It sounded so weird. It wasn't Canadian or Korean. Then I saw a movie, Grease. I was so inspired by John Travolta's portrayal of the character Danny Zuko, in Grade 9 during roll call, the teacher read my name and I said, \"that's pronounced Danny Choi.\"\n\nOlivia Newton-John and John Travolta in Grease. Travolta played Danny Zuko, which inspired Ins Choi to adopt the first name Danny in school. (Paramount Pictures)\n\nFor most of my high school life I was Danny Choi. Then later in life I got a little artsy and Danny was too boring.\n\nI reclaimed Insurp and my friends started short-forming it to Ins. I like it because it rhymed with Prince and I love Prince and it sounded like I was in a club when people would say it in succession.\n\nQ: How does changing your name impact your life?\n\nA: I wanted to be less Korean and more Canadian. I didn't want to have to explain my name or who I was. It's a familiar immigrant story.\n\nQ: Did that affect your sense of humour, other aspects of your life?\n\nA: Absolutely.\n\nI talk about trying to find a role model, trying to find someone who looks like me on TV, in media, someone who I could cling to. \"You kind of look like me and I like you, I want to be like you.\"\n\nEventually I found them in professional skateboarders like Steve Caballero or professional wrestlers like Ricky (The Dragon) Steamboat \u2014 this is going way back.\n\nIt is a painful experience, but through humour, I put it in perspective.\n\nQ: Kim's Convenience started as a stage show. Talk about the evolution of it.\n\nA: When I was little I thought Casey from Mr. Dressup was Asian because he was a little bit yellow hued. I was so desperate, I would take Casey because there was a lack of representation.\n\nNow, my kids and their friends don't think seeing an Asian on TV is a surprise, it is not a unique thing, which is amazing.\n\nPuppets Casey, centre, and Finnegan with Ernie Coombs, who portrayed Mr. Dressup on the iconic children's show. (CBC)\n\nQ: Are we getting a little more diverse, with shows like Fresh Off the Boat and Crazy Rich Asians?\n\nA: This last summer was a big summer for North American Asians, with Crazy Rich Asians and Searching. There were online celebrations.\n\nThere's a lot of work to be done but it's great to see things are changing.\n\nQ: You were searching for a role model and now you are one. Do you see yourself as a pioneer?\n\nA: I will take it. It's great to have a platform where all of those artists can shine, that other people see.\n\nIn the realm of comedy, it allows people to understand that we are all one, humankind.\n\nThere is so much division in the world today and politics.

In Vietnamese-American playwright Qui Nguyen's Vietgone, it's a starting point.\n\nThe 2015 play, opening the season at the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre's Warehouse, is \"not a story about war \u2014 it's a story about falling in love,\" says Peter Fernandes, who takes on the role of Qui Nguyen in a funny, metatheatrical opening that tells us that the real Nguyen, as playwright, plans to mess around a bit with theatrical convention.\n\nAnd Vietgone does, with an unexpected but stylish and appealing approach to the story that blends comedy, drama and romance with a bit of rap and a little kung fu fighting.\n\nYes, it's odd \u2014 but for the most part, it works.\n\nVietgone tells the story of playwright Qui Nguyen's real parents, Tong and Quang (Simu Liu of Kim's Convenience fame, front), as they try to make a new life in America after the Vietnam War. (Dylan Hewlett/Royal MTC)\n\nThe story here follows Nguyen's real parents \u2014 Quang (Simu Liu, of Kim's Convenience fame), a South Vietnamese pilot, and Tong (Stephanie Sy, seen earlier this season as one of the leads in PTE's Prairie Nurse).\n\nPost-war, both have ended up in a refugee camp in Arkansas \u2014 a situation they react to in wildly different ways.\n\nTong, who tamps down sentimentality with a tough exterior and biting wit, maintains she has no draw to her home country and is determined to make America her new home.\n\nQuang, meanwhile, is just as determined to find a way to get from middle America back to his family in Vietnam. That's also the goal of Tong's mother, the sharp-tongued Huong (Jennifer Villaverde, in a deliciously nasty performance), whose homesickness manifests in a disdain for the food, the language and the people of America.\n\nJeff Yung rounds out the cast with a likably goofy turn as Quang's sidekick, Nhan, while Fernandes delights in a series of small supporting parts (his \"Hippie Dude\" may be worth the price of admission on his own).\n\nFrom left to right: Jennifer Villaverde, Stephanie Sy, Peter Fernandes and Jeff Yung. Nguyen laces his script with lots of witty humour and a mish-mash of genre and pop culture references, including monologues delivered in the form of rap songs. (Dylan Hewlett/Royal MTC)\n\nStories of immigration and culture clash aren't new, but Nguyen makes it clear (with great comic style) from the outset that he intends to dispense with stereotype.\n\nNo broken English, bad accents or \"earnest, humourless Asian\" tropes here. Instead, he has his characters speaking more like contemporary young adults \u2014 underscoring the fact that in 1975, that's exactly what his parents, though strangers in a strange land, were.\n\nThat also means Nguyen \u2014 telling the story of immigrants through the filter of a gen-X first-generation American \u2014 laces his script with lots of witty humour and a mish-mash of genre and pop-culture references. That includes monologues delivered in the form of rap songs (not quite Hamilton-level dope, but delivered with panache, and resulting in what is likely the highest number of \"motherf--kers\" ever dropped on an MTC stage).\n\nDirector Robert Ross Parker's stylish production makes smart use of Hugh Conacher's video projections to take us through various locales and time periods as the play tells the story of Tong (Stephanie Sy) and Quang (Simu Liu). (Dylan Hewlett/Royal MTC)\n\nThere's also a bit of slapstick (a courtship montage between Quang and Tong, interrupted by her protective mother, becomes a nice bit of physical comedy thanks to clever use of the sliding panels that make up Joanna Yu's versatile set).\n\nAs well, smart use of Hugh Conacher's video projections takes us through the various locales and time periods the story covers, and yes, there's some kung fu fighting \u2014 a pretty great, Bruce Lee-flick-style scrap (wonderfully choreographed by Jacqueline Loewen).\n\nIt all mixes together more effectively than you'd think it might in director Robert Ross Parker's inventive and energetic 135-minute (with intermission) production, though the script's winking, tongue-in-cheek tone sometimes undercuts the play's sincerity in the first act.\n\nNot everybody is kung fu fighting in Vietgone, but Peter Fernandes and Simu Liu engage in a Bruce Lee-flick-style scrap, wonderfully choreographed by Jacqueline Loewen. (Dylan Hewlett/Royal MTC)\n\nAs the relationship between Quang and Tong \u2014 presented by Liu and Sy as believably complicated but still sympathetic characters \u2014 grows and shifts, we're drawn into a story that has surprising layers of complexity.\n\nThe point Nguyen makes is that the stories we think we know often aren't quite what we thought \u2014 whether the story of the Vietnam War, or of \"the immigrant experience\" in America, or of our parents.\n\nThrow in some good beats and a bit of kung fu fighting, and Vietgone makes for a thoughtful, lively and fresh piece of theatre.\n\nVietgone runs at the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre's Tom Hendry Warehouse until Nov. 17.", "The public is being warned not to approach a Royal Newfoundland Constabulary police dog that went missing Friday afternoon in Paradise, during a search for a suspect.\n\n\"The RNC Police Dog Services would like the public to be aware that PSD EDGE is a service dog and to not approach him,\" police said in a statement.\n\n**WANTED** Chad QUILTY (1990-2-11) is WANTED and was the suspect that PSD Edge was tracking when he fled from his handler earlier this afternoon.

Because these days, the man who claims to have ignited a worldwide \"populist revolution\" is having trouble drawing flies.\n\nA \"micro-rally\" at a Holiday Inn Express in North Topeka, Kan., on Tuesday drew a crowd of 25, including the organizers and a crew that's trailing Bannon for a documentary. (To be fair, the event appears to have been publicized strictly via all-caps text messages.)\n\nBannon himself admits that his \"grassroots\" tour to whip up Trump's \"deplorables\" in advance of next week's midterms \u2014 and screen his self-produced Trump @War documentary \u2014 has been an intimate affair, with a half-dozen audiences of fewer than 10 people.\n\nA showing in Staten Island last week attracted 38 Bannon fans. A rally at a firehouse outside a Buffalo, N.Y., firehall a couple of days later drew a comparably huge 200 people, but none of the Republican candidates that he was ostensibly there to support.\n\nWhat has become increasingly clear is that \"Sloppy Steve\" is no longer considered polite company.\n\nBannon had a major hand in helping Trump win the U.S. presidency, but Bannon's own tenure in the White House was relatively short-lived. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nThe New Yorker magazine backed away from a plan to feature him in its fall festival after social media was set aflame by angry readers, and other celebrity guests started dropping out.\n\nAn onstage interview event in London, UK, at the Bloomberg Invest Summit went ahead, but provoked a major mutiny among the business network's employees, with 91 staffers signing their name to a letter criticizing management for \"creating space\" for a man who \"targeted women, black and Muslim populations\" when he was working in the White House.\n\nAnd a scheduled keynote address to the 15th International Conference on Advances in Computer Entertainment Technology at the University of Montana in December \u2014 the topic is \"how economic nationalism will help minorities obtain more high-tech jobs\" \u2014 now seems to be in doubt after complaints and boycott calls. (The Fourth International Congress on Love and Sex with Robots, happening in the same space at the same time, is so far unaffected.)\n\nEven the populist politicians who might be benefitting from Bannon's advice and insights are loathe to admit it.\n\nAfter Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazil's new president, told a magazine that Bannon was helping his dad with voter analysis and data interpretation, Jair Bolsonaro denied having any ties whatsoever to the controversial strategist. \"Typical fake news,\" said the man who has been nicknamed the \"Tropical Trump.\"\n\nBannon's efforts to launch a pan-European alliance of far-right parties called The Movement is off to a slow start, as leaders like Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini blow hot and cold on the idea of being associated with him.\n\nIn fact, the only person who really seems to want to hang out with Bannon is Robert Mueller. Last week, the special counsel probing the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia interviewed Bannon for at least the third time.\n\nThe subject of the meeting was apparently the timing of Wikileaks' release of hacked Clinton campaign emails during the 2016 election.\n\nA walk in their shoes\n\nThe National's Susan Ormiston reports from Mexico on the myths and realities of the Central American migrants hoping to make their way to the U.S. border.\n\nTravelling with the migrant caravan in Mexico, it's difficult to square the rising rhetoric from Washington with the worn-out feet here.\n\nSix-year-old Josue has a nasty blister on his toe.

(Mia Sheldon/CBC)\n\nIt's simply not so. None of the parents we met during our week with the caravan were staging their walk. Many signed up in Honduras, on social media, without being persuaded by some unseen political hand.\n\nAmong the 4,000 people still walking and riding, there are those who will likely never get into the U.S. legally as a refugee or asylum seeker. We met at least three men in three days who'd already been deported from the U.S. once, leaving wives or girlfriends and kids behind. They are part of this caravan, too.\n\nBut we found no evidence to justify the broad condemnations from Washington that these migrants are actors in an evil play.\n\nWhen the large group of central American migrants first broke out of Guatemala and into Mexico, it appeared they might benefit from the daily news coverage and the focus on \"lost countries,\" as one woman described her home, Honduras.\n\nBut that spotlight has not gone their way, with the U.S. president seizing on a perceived threat to whip up resistance at home, and turn immigration into one of the toxic issues in the U.S. midterm election.\n\nThe U.S. is pressuring Mexico to deal with this \"problem,\" and there are small signs it is working. This week, buses secured locally for part of the journey north out of Juchitan were cancelled. Organizers say it was due to pressure from the Mexican government.\n\nIt was one sign the strategy to keep the caravan wandering down south is working.

Macdonald in Canada prompted reporter Nick Purdon and producer Leonardo Palleja to dig down to the roots of the debate.\n\nSometimes you just have to get out of the way and let the story unfold in front of you.\n\nThat's what happened in Regina when Leonardo Palleja and I were interviewing a man named Patrick Johnson in front of a statue of Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\nJohnson was telling us about the time he loaded a sledgehammer into his car in the middle of the night and drove to the park to attack Sir John.\n\n\"I gave it three whacks on this side and three whacks on the other and nothing really moved,\" he said. \"It was just like a big ding -- like a big bell ringing.\"\n\nPatrick Johnson says the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald in Regina, seen behind him, should be removed because the former prime minister was the architect of Canada\u2019s residential school system. (Nick Purdon/CBC)\n\nJohnson said he started to laugh, because the sledgehammer did absolutely nothing to the statue \u2026 other than provide him with a metaphor.\n\n\"It was frustrating, but also eye-opening that it would take more than me to change something,\" he said.\n\nJohnson then told us about the time he sprayed red paint on the Sir John A. statue's hands. Even though he has publicly admitted to the act, he planned to plead not guilty to the mischief charge.\n\n\"The question is, am I guilty of mischief or am I guilty of public education?\" he said.\n\nJohnson said the statue should be removed from the park because it is an insult to Indigenous people. Macdonald was the architect of Canada's residential school system, where thousands of Indigenous children died and many others were abused.\n\nOf course, not everyone agrees with him.\n\nWhile we were talking to Johnson, a man biked by on his way home from work. He recognized Johnson and yelled: \"Vandal, vandal!\"\n\nPerfect, I thought.\n\nI stopped the man on the bike, whose name is Gordon Blackmore, and I explained what Johnson and I were discussing. He and Johnson started to argue, and Leonardo filmed the whole thing.\n\nOur goal had always been to capture both sides of the argument over what to do with the statues of Sir John A. Macdonald, and here was the debate unfolding right in front of us.\n\nIt was unscripted and real. Have a look.\n\nPatrick Johnson argues with Gordon Blackmore about the statue of Sir John A MacDonald in Victoria Park, Regina. 0:42\n\nWATCH: Nick Purdon and Leonardo Palleja's story on Sir John A. Macdonald's legacy Sunday on The National on CBC Television or stream it online\n\nChanging the time on a BIG clock\n\nThe clocks fall back this weekend, so producer Greg Hobbs went to find out what it takes to keep a century-old timepiece ticking smoothly.\n\nThis Sunday, as you relax in bed for the extra hour that the end of Daylight Savings will afford you, spare a thought for John Scott. He'll be up bright and early to make sure one of Canada's historic landmarks, the clock tower at Toronto's Old City Hall, isn't out of step with the times.\n\nScott is the horologist tasked with preserving and adjusting the century-old iron and steel mechanism behind the four faces of the tower. He'll walk up more than 350 steps to get to the clock.\n\nHorologist John Scott works on the 100-year-old clock in the tower of Old City Hall in Toronto. (Greg Hobbs/CBC)\n\nBut don't feel too sorry for him. It's a labour of love, and he has a contagious passion for the timepiece.\n\n\"It's a work of art,\" says Scott, of the fine-tuned cogs and springs that have been meticulously ticking away for more than 100 years.\n\n\"And to imagine they were able to put this together and install it \u2026 [how they did it] has me baffled.\"\n\nIt is indeed a wondrous piece of old-world technology. Toronto's Old City Hall tower clock was built in Croydon, England, and began operating on New Year's Eve 1900.\n\nHowever, it's not without temperamental issues. Sudden changes in the weather can cause the clock's timekeeping to fluctuate occasionally, for example.\n\nBut thanks to Scott's careful and continuous tinkering, it rarely drifts more than a few seconds out of time per month.\n\nHorologist John Scott explains how he regulates the huge century-old mechanical timepiece at Toronto's Old City Hall clock tower. 0:33\n\nOn Sunday, Scott will stop the pendulum with his foot, and while the clock's mechanical parts are halted, he'll spend the extra hour inspecting and cleaning.\n\n\"Ever since I took over this contract, I've enjoyed every minute in this tower,\" he says.\n\nIn 2011, at the city's request, Scott reluctantly put together a budget to replace the old machinery with an automated, satellite-corrected timing system. But he was relieved when the city went with the option of maintaining the original mechanism instead.\n\n\"It was a lot of work to put this in. I'm not spoiling all the man-hours of sweat and labour to get all this up in here. I don't want those guys rolling over in their graves thinking I've just deactivated all of their labour.\"\n\nDon't forget to put your clocks back on Nov. 4.

It was about gun violence, second chances and finding a way to break the cycle of incarceration.\n\nBut then, as many stories we work on do, it evolved.\n\n\"What do you know about Uniacke Square?\" 20-year-old Trayvone Clayton asked me, reversing our roles halfway through our interview.\n\nTrayvone Clayton, a 20-year-old basketball player who attends Saint Mary's University, says 902 ManUp's messages resonate with his community. (Jill English/CBC)\n\nIt wasn't the first time I had been asked that question over the three days CBC News video producer Eric Woolliscroft and I spent in the Halifax public housing block known as \"The Square.\"\n\nResidents asked because they knew the answer. They were proving a point about how their community is perceived.\n\nUniacke Square has a reputation for violence, and people like Clayton -- a St. Mary's University basketball player who calls it home -- resent that it's all people know.\n\n\"These young people take pride in their community, there's a lot of good here,\" Clayton's father and the central figure in tonight's story on The National told us. \"But they literally have to fake their street address just to get a [job] interview.\"\n\nWhat residents also want people to see is the warmth that exists in \"Square Town\" and the support they offer each other.\n\nMembers of 902 ManUp run events like a weekly Friday night basketball game, holiday dinners and school supply drives to support the community. (Jill English/CBC)\n\nHow to explain that more tangibly? Well, these interviews were unlike any I have ever done.\n\nEveryone we spoke to \u2013 whether it was James, his nephew Corey Wright, longtime community member Shawn Parker \u2013 made time for every friend and neighbour who passed by. They could be mid-thought with two cameras rolling on them, it didn't matter -- they always stopped to say hello.\n\nIt was so telling, our editor Brenda Witmer couldn't help but build some of that into our story, like this exchange with James:\n\n902 ManUp president Marcus James explains the Halifax group's approach to issues in the community, but not without acknowledging a neighbour driving by. Formed to address local gun violence, the group of volunteers has become an integral part of the neighbourhood culture. 0:39\n\nIt's this sense of community that tonight's story profiles, through the lens of a group seeking to empower fellow black men to do better, to help one another and to feel pride in who they are.\n\nAs Parker said to us many times when describing Uniacke Square, \"the spirit is contagious.\"\n\nCatch it tonight on The National.\n\n- Jill English\n\nWATCH: The story about 902 ManUp tonight on The National on CBC Television or stream it online\n\nREAD: Jill English's feature on 902 ManUp\n\nQuote of the moment\n\n\"Let's rock.\"\n\nThe final words of Edmund Zagorski, a convicted double-murderer who opted for execution via the electric chair at a Tennessee prison this morning.\n\nWhat The National is reading\n\nJamal Khashoggi's body was 'dissolved,' says Erdogan adviser ( Guardian )\n\n) UN report: Nearly half a billion people in Asia-Pacific region go hungry ( CBC )\n\n) New Brunswick government falls in confidence vote ( CBC )\n\n) U.S. to give 8 countries oil waivers under Iran sanctions ( Straits Times )\n\n) 2 Quebec seniors confined to basement for years, say police ( Montreal Gazette )\n\n) B.C. man kicked off WestJet flight after falling asleep before takeoff ( CBC )\n\n) Fist fight caused fatal Chinese bus plunge ( BBC )\n\n) Beyond the McRib ( Tedium)\n\nToday in history\n\nNov. 2, 1993: The Royal Canadian Air Farce celebrates 20 years on radio\n\nThree members of Canada's never-ending comedy troupe sit down with Midday's Tina Srebotnjak, shortly before two decades on the radio became forever on New Year's Eve.

He was born in Poland in 1930 and lived to see a Soviet invasion, and then Nazi occupation of the country.\n\nDuring this time he witnessed unimaginable horrors, including the murder of his grandfather.\n\nSmart immigrated to Canada in 1948 with help from the Canadian Jewish Congress. He was one of 1,000 Jewish war orphans allowed to come to Canada. Eventually, he settled in Montreal, where he lives today.\n\nAfter decades of silence, he's telling his story in a new book call Chaos to Canvas. He also says he wants to educate the public about anti-Semitism and sees it in recent events, including the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nHe spoke to Portia Clark, host of Information Morning Nova Scotia .\n\nWhat do you remember about landing here 70 years ago?\n\nIt was not pleasant. I came in on a boat which was a very simple [military] boat with bunk beds. We slept on bunks, maybe 10 people each. Pier 21 was not a pleasant entrance. It [had] black dark metal cages, and I think there were soldiers. It was a little bit scary.\n\nI was 17-years-old [when I arrived], and 62 people in my family had been killed including my mother, father and my sister. I was left totally alone.\n\nDescribe the events leading up to your arrival in Canada.\n\nIt was very bad. It was a life that I tried all these years \u2014 I'm 80-years-old \u2014 to forget. It was horrible.\n\nImagine killing a [whole] family. I come from a city of 8,000 Jews. Only 100 of those 8,000 survived and I am one of those 100. Just imagine the catastrophe and the horror that I had to live through as a child to come to Canada.\n\nWhen did your family realize they had to flee to survive?\n\nThere was no realizing. Nobody knew, nobody imagined. Nobody could even imagine that something like this could happen. How could you imagine walking in the streets and being killed. How could you imagine taking children and throwing them on trucks.\n\nYou can't imagine anything [like that]. There's no imagination that somebody could describe it. I can't describe the horrors that I saw.\n\nHave you always been comfortable discussing what happened?\n\nI have not discussed the Holocaust for 50 years until my children and my family said maybe I should say something about it. Maybe I should not hide like I did for so many years. Maybe I should expose it.\n\nTo [relive it again] is not easy. But maybe it's worth it if you could learn something from it, if you could really analyze it.

I am not against democracy and freedom of speech, but you take a hate group and you give them the freedom of speech to be able to talk on the internet and freely express their hatred. You teach them they're not alone. There's no such a thing as a lone wolf. [The Pittsburgh shooter] was talking to thousands of people about what he was going to do.\n\nHe was talking to thousands of people and spreading what he was doing. And people were listening to him. There are going to be copycats.\n\nWhat should be done to keep on top of those groups that are spreading those kinds of hateful things on the internet?\n\nI don't say ban democracy or ban freedom of speech. I say put in some rules \u2014 you cannot openly hate people, you cannot tell them to kill.

(CBC Archives)\n\nBut the provincial decisions not to follow daylight time, while the United States did, would have an impact on industries that needed to coordinate schedules.\n\n\"Stock exchanges ... in Montreal and Toronto say they will open an hour early to adjust to the American market,\" said Stout.\n\nAir Canada hoped B.C. would stick to standard time because \"severe problems\" would be the result for transcontinental services.\n\nWhat it meant for the CBC\n\nAnd Canadian TV networks were affected by the change to U.S. clocks.\n\n\"CTV says it will have to reschedule 60 programs,\" noted Stout. \"The CBC, with its higher Canadian content, will have fewer problems.\"\n\nOf course, if Canadians were really interested in saving energy, there was one thing they could do.\n\n\"Leave the car at home and hop a bus,\" he said.", "Two people accused of confining and extorting a couple they were caring for appeared in court in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res today.\n\nLocal police say the alleged victims, a couple in their 60s who are mentally impaired, were intermittently locked in the home while they lived with the suspects \u2014 in the case of the male alleged victim, from September 2014 until June 2018.\n\nThe suspects have been charged with forcible confinement, assault, extortion and uttering threats.\n\nThe female alleged victim did not return to the home after she received medical treatment for a fall in August 2017, and the man escaped the home nearly a year later, in June 2018.\n\nSgt. Luc Mongrain said the delay between the two victims' escapes might have been due to their vulnerability.\n\n\"These were people who were psychologically manipulated. I can imagine they feared there would be consequences and reprisals,\" he said.\n\nHe said the investigation began after local fire prevention services saw locks outside a door leading to the basement while they were inspecting the home last year.\n\nCouple under woman's care since 2009\n\nPolice had to meet several witnesses to corroborate the story and obtain arrest and search warrants, Mongrain said. The suspects, a man and woman in their 50s, were arrested Thursday at the home on Pics-Bois Street.\n\nMongrain said it appears the male alleged victim escaped during a time where the door was not locked. The suspects tightly controlled the lives and finances of the couple, he said, but allowed them to go into town now and then.\n\nHe said the couple has been under the female suspect's care since 2009, when they lived in Rimouski. In 2014, she moved to Trois-Rivi\u00e8res to live with her new boyfriend, the male suspect.\n\nThe couple moved with her.

Analysts blamed trading algorithms for that fall and a series of other crashes in the market.\n\nEarlier this year, Andrew Smith wrote about \"Franken-algorithms\" for The Guardian, suggesting that software in our lives had become complex and unpredictable and the consequences could be deadly.\n\n\"Once an algorithm is learning, we no longer know to any degree of certainty what its rules and parameters are,\" wrote Smith. \"At which point we can't be certain of how it will interact with other algorithms, the physical world, or us.\"\n\nEvolving algorithms are less predictable\n\nTech expert Don Burks describes an algorithm as \"a series of instructions that you would do to solve a problem and it produces a successful, repeatable result.\"\n\nDon Burks is the head instructor at at Lighthouse Labs, which aims to train the next generation of developers and transform the way tech education is delivered. (Don Burks/LinkedIn)\n\nBurks is the head instructor at Lighthouse Labs, based in Vancouver, which offers coding camps for people interested in a career in software development.\n\n\"What has changed over time is the complexity of what we're able to do and the power of the hardware on which we're able to do it,\" said Burks. \"We're also trying to solve bigger problems like climate change and self-driving cars.\"\n\nJean-Luc Dery is the chief technology officer at Thinking Capital, a Montreal-based financial technology company that enables small businesses to access capital quickly.\n\n\"We've evolved where those algorithms are learning and the amount of predictability that is attached to those algorithms is less and less,\" said Dery. \"They're learning they can actually rewrite themselves and, depending on the environment that they're operating in, they may have different behaviours.\"\n\nOut of control chatbots\n\nA chatbot is a computer program designed to stimulate conversation with human users.\n\nLast year, Facebook's experiment tasked two chatbots to negotiate with each other. But instead of using English, they developed a private language that their human operators couldn't understand.\n\nIt was a case of the robots creating a more efficient way to do what they had to do \u2014 communicate \u2014 and the humans eventually turned them off.\n\nAccording to Burks, the problem is with the data we put in, not with the algorithms crunching the data. He referenced Microsoft's racist chatbot as an example of this.\n\nIn March 2016, Microsoft launched Tay, a Twitter chatbot meant to test and improve Microsoft's understanding of conversational language. But Twitter trolls flooded the bot with racist and misogynistic comments.\n\nFrom these interactions, Tay learned to tweet what Microsoft admitted was \"wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images,\" and had to be deactivated within the first 24 hours.\n\n\"Tay is now offline and we'll look to bring Tay back only when we are confident we can better anticipate malicious intent that conflicts with our principles and values,\" said Peter Lee, corporate vice-president of Microsoft Healthcare in a statement posted to the official Microsoft blog.\n\n'The human is still in charge'\n\nJean-Luc Dery is the chief technology officer at Thinking Capital, a Montreal-based financial technology company that enables small businesses to access capital quickly.

He is confident programmers and software developers have their hands firmly on the steering wheel.\n\n\"You know there are good monsters [and] bad monsters,\" said Dery. \"We want to make sure that we put the regulations in place, the best practices in place, that will allow us to keep the good monsters and keep all the benefits of these amazing technologies.\"", "Watch live on television and online on Saturday at 10 p.m. ET as the Calgary Flames host the Chicago Blackhawks on Hockey Night on Canada.", "Driving around Edmonton was dicey Friday as freezing rain and a dusting of snow covered roads and highways across Alberta in black ice.\n\nBetween 5:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., 206 collisions were reported to police.\n\nThe total included 180 property damage collisions, 12 injury accidents and 14 hit-and-runs, police said in a news release.\n\nMinor fender-benders caused bottlenecks and traffic jams across the city.\n\nEdmonton police urged drivers to have patience.\n\n\"Your vehicle is not as skilled on ice as Connor McDavid,\" the Edmonton Police Service said in a tweet.\n\n\"Your tires are not skates.

Others have made homophobic comments.\n\nThe party seemed to be playing whack-a-mole with its own members. It wasn't clear who was winning. And then came the news story about Strashok.\n\nIt couldn't have come at a worse time for the UCP, just days after the massacre of Jewish worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nKenney wanted to move quickly and definitively.\n\nBoy, did he ever. Not only did he kick out Strashok, Kenney suggested he wants a system in place to make sure another Strashok isn't waiting in the wings to damage the party's reputation.\n\n\"I recently also asked the Board of the UCP to develop a process for screening applicants for membership to block those who have expressed hateful or extreme views.\"\n\nNew members to be screened\n\nIt is a remarkable statement.

I think it's unprecedented.\"\n\nNixon suggested the UCP might have more people with extreme views than other parties simply because the UCP has many more members than any other party.\n\nHmm. I'm not sure that's much of a defence.\n\nAnyway, having a party screen its members for \"hateful and extreme views\" certainly is unprecedented, to say the least.\n\nIt's an extraordinary measure but for the UCP these are extraordinary times.\n\nThe party is doing well in public opinion polls but is in danger of self-immolation thanks to members with extreme views.\n\nUCP 'further to the right'\n\nEven former Wildrose leader Brian Jean weighed in this week via a tweet, urging Kenney to \"stop playing footsy with freaks!\"\n\nWatching this unfold with an I-told-you-so on his lips is MLA Richard Starke, who refused to join the UCP last year after the unification vote between the Progressive Conservatives and Wildrose.\n\nStarke thought the new United Conservatives under Kenney would be too conservative for most Albertans.\n\n\"The decision I made has been confirmed,\" he said in an interview Thursday. \"The new party is further to the right than either the Progressive Conservatives or the Wildrose party.\"\n\nStarke says he believes that as part of a strategy to win the leadership races for the PCs and then the UCP, Kenney attracted people with extreme viewpoints.\n\nNow, Kenney is living with the consequences.\n\nAs are Albertans, said Starke.\n\n\"They're not enamoured with the current government and they don't want to see the current government get re-elected but they have real reservations about the UCP. So, they're sort of saying, 'Well what else is there?' \"\n\nIt's a question Starke is asking himself.\n\nStarke still calls himself a Progressive Conservative but the PC party is effectively dead.

Among other things, it can order the carmaker to buy back the vehicle, pay for repairs and reimburse complainants for previous repairs.\n\nHowever, there are restrictions on the age and mileage of vehicles that qualify for arbitration. Its decisions are also final and vehicle owners must agree they will take no further action against the automaker, regardless of the decision.\n\nIn four of the nine complaints it heard about the Ford Focus in 2017, CAMVAP ordered Ford to buy back the vehicles but the decision details are not published so it is not possible to determine what issue caused that ruling.\n\nProvinces have representation on the CAMVAP board, but \"they have been very weak,\" said Iny.\n\nStatus quo a 'sad situation'\n\n\"They have not made significant improvements to the program until recently,\" he said, adding his association would like CAMVAP to include a definition of lemon so that people can have more certainty about returning a seriously defective vehicle.\n\nA lemon law in Canada would offer a level of protection for vehicle owners whose cars have repeatedly needed the same repair.

They say all levels of government need to focus on building more subsidized housing and improving the housing that already exists.\n\nThe province has already done work to help address those concerns, according to Nova Scotia's minister for the department of seniors. Leo Glavine said the government has set up a tax rebate program, supplied money for people to repair their homes, and introduced a heating rebate program, all of which support seniors.\n\nLeo Glavine is minister of the Nova Scotia Department of Seniors.

Got tummy trouble? Want to help your hair or fix your skin? Could what you're eating be ailing you? That's certainly the sales pitch from companies behind food sensitivity tests.\n\nThey're often advertised as a quick solution to a range of health issues, including by two of Canada's biggest labs \u2014 despite the fact the science behind these questionable tests has been discredited by medical groups around the world.\n\nAnd consumers, including Laura Chapnick, are buying in.\n\nWhile waiting for other blood tests and an ultrasound in a Dynacare clinic, Chapnick saw an ad stating that 45 per cent of people suffer from food intolerances. Desperate for answers to her ongoing stomach problems, Chapnick later asked to take the $325 food intolerance test.\n\nShe said she \"genuinely believed that doing ... the blood test was going to give me absolute factual answers that I needed.\"\n\nLaura Chapnick decided to ask for an IgG blood test for food sensitivities after seeing an ad in a Dynacare clinic. She was there for other blood tests and an ultrasound. (CBC)\n\nWithin weeks, she received a report outlining 26 foods she should reduce or eliminate altogether. Many were foods she had been eating regularly, including corn, potatoes, peanuts, wheat, milk and eggs.\n\n\"These tests scared the crap out of me,\" she said. \"These food tests scared me into believing that whatever I put in my mouth was toxic.\"\n\nGrocery shopping and eating quickly became a challenge. \"I felt like a prisoner in my own head almost,\" Chapnick said, \"and became very obsessive, trying to figure out what can I eat.\"\n\nAlso on Marketplace this week: Investigating the rise of 'tech abuse' and the truth about popular (and pricey) 'teatoxes.'

And with food sensitivity tests specifically ranging in cost from more than $100 to nearly $400, companies are cashing in on the craze.\n\nTwo of Canada's biggest labs, Dynacare and LifeLabs, promote and offer something known as IgG food tests at their labs, marketed as a way to test for food sensitivities.\n\nBut medical experts, including the Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (CSACI), call IgG tests for food sensitivities \"unvalidated,\" and more than two dozen organizations warn about the misuse of such tests.\n\nThe reports being generated by the IgG test taken by Chapnick and countless others are being grossly misinterpreted, critics say.\n\nFood sensitivities are different from food allergies. An allergy is an immediate, immune response, and foods like nuts and seafood are often known to cause allergic responses that can be life-threatening.\n\nSensitivities or intolerances, on the other hand, are not related to the immune system and often take hours, if not days, to take effect \u2014 and are therefore very difficult to diagnose.\n\nExposure not intolerance\n\nDr. Douglas Mack, a pediatric allergy, asthma and immunology specialist, argues the results of an IgG test are an indication that you had exposure to the foods \u2014 not an intolerance of them.\n\nIgG tests measure levels of an antibody known as Immunoglobulin G \u2014 or IgG, for short.\n\n\"It should be used to track whether a patient actually is developing tolerance, not intolerance,\" he said.\n\nDr. Douglas Mack is a pediatric allergy, asthma and immunology specialist. (Dave MacIntosh/CBC)\n\nInterpreting the test otherwise is not only incorrect, but potentially hazardous to your health, Mack argues. By unnecessarily eliminating foods, he says he sees \"kids that are coming in with nutritional deficiencies, with failure to grow very well.\"\n\nRemoving foods from your diet could also lead to development of a food allergy, especially in children, says Mack. One young patient of his developed a milk allergy after eliminating it from his diet when a food sensitivity test suggested he had a milk intolerance.\n\n\"If these tests result in the harm of a child, we really gotta think twice about whether or not these labs should be offering these,\" he said.\n\nPutting the test to the test\n\nTo test the accuracy of these food sensitivity tests, Marketplace ran several different kinds on host Charlsie Agro, including drawing blood for the IgG tests offered by Dynacare and Rocky Mountain Analytical, which is owned by LifeLabs.\n\nBoth tests require a requisition from a naturopathic doctor or licensed physician. LifeLabs' test is typically offered through naturopaths or other health outlets, however, while Dynacare's food intolerance test is advertised and promoted directly to the consumer in its clinics.\n\nThe results from the Rocky Mountain Analytical test reported intolerances to 52 foods, while Dynacare reported 30 intolerances.\n\nThe tests offered by both Dynacare and Rocky Mountain Analytical require a requisition from a naturopathic doctor or licensed physician. (Tyana Grundig/CBC)\n\nBefore taking the tests, Agro had tracked what she was eating. Yet both tests reported intolerances to foods she regularly consumed, with absolutely no adverse reactions.\n\nFor example, Agro had a smoothie, which included flax seeds, for breakfast daily. Yet both tests suggested Agro is intolerant to flax. She also ate vegetable soup \u2014 containing barley, kidney beans and corn \u2014 without problem. Both IgG tests again claimed Agro is intolerant to these foods.\n\nBoth sets of lab results also showed Agro is \"intolerant\" of egg whites, all milks, wheat and gluten \u2014 all foods she eats regularly without issue.\n\nWhat the results say\n\nIgG is really a memory antibody, says Dr. David Stukus, an associate professor of pediatrics with the allergy and immunology department at the Ohio-based Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n\n\"Measuring specific IgG levels merely detects that the person has eaten it at some point in the past,\" he said. \"It is a normal physiological response to eating.\"\n\nStukus also said it wasn't surprising that foods Agro hadn't consumed in the weeks leading up to her blood tests showed up in her results.\n\nOne set of Charlsie Agro's test results showed flax was a problem food for her. Yet she puts flax seed into her morning smoothie daily and has never felt negative effects. (John Lesavage/CBC)\n\nSome foods \"have cross-reactivity,\" he said, meaning the proteins in one food are similar to the proteins in another.\n\n\"So it is possible that [the test] is picking up the memory antibody of other similar foods that have been eaten in the past,\" Stukus said.\n\nHe points to peanuts as a common example: If you've eaten peanut butter, your results might suggest you are intolerant to other legumes, like soy or other beans.\n\nSerious side effects\n\nMore than 25 leading health organizations from around the world have warned about the misinterpretation of IgG tests, including a Health Canada scientist who wrote \"these tests are not reliable and should not be recommended as a single diagnosis tool.\"\n\nPosition papers from international medical communities have called the IgG blood test for food sensitivities \"irrelevant,\" \"unvalidated\" and \"inappropriate,\" warning that the test provides \"false diagnoses\" and that \"the test should not be performed\" for such a purpose.\n\nThere can also be adverse effects to drastically limiting your diet, including malnutrition and disordered eating patterns, says Stukus.\n\nChapnick said her eating patterns changed significantly after she got her IgG test back, which was done by Dynacare.

(CBC)\n\nMack says he is especially troubled by the IgG claims being made by LifeLabs and Dynacare through its marketing, as these are two of Canada's largest blood labs, conducting millions of tests annually for everything from cancer screening to workplace drug testing.\n\n\"These are labs that we send patients to to get their bloodwork done for their iron, or to see if they have cancer, or to see whatever,\" he said. \"But in the same place, these labs are now offering a test for which there is no validity.\"\n\nSengmueller echoes that concern.\n\n\"I'm surprised that an organization as reputable as Dynacare would be offering this to their clients, especially while they're waiting to get their blood work done \u2014 they're kind of a captive audience. It's disappointing.\"\n\nAnswering for IgG\n\nWhen Marketplace asked the Ontario Ministry of Health about the manner in which IgG tests are being marketed in the province, a spokesperson said that labs are \"operating as private businesses \u2026 and are allowed to provide a variety of tests that they are licensed to perform.\"\n\nHealth Canada told Marketplace it has issued medical device licences for some IgG tests, but that none are \"intended to be a single tool to be used for diagnosis of food intolerance.\"\n\nIn its response, Dynacare said that \"debate exists\" about the use of the tests for food sensitivities, but \"peer-reviewed articles support the use of the food IgG test as an additional source of information.\"\n\nAnd the company said it \"relies on the expertise of the ordering health professional to determine the appropriateness of a particular test for a particular patient.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nLifeLabs, the parent company of Rocky Mountain Analytical, also said that \"numerous studies in peer-reviewed journals have shown the health benefits of removing IgG-reactive foods,\" and that \"a test does not need to be diagnostic to be clinically relevant and useful.\"\n\nDynacare and LifeLabs provided those peer-reviewed studies to Marketplace, which were then analyzed by clinical epidemiologist and biostatician Jason Busse, DC, PhD. He found that \"all of the studies were very problematic,\" and said he was \"amazed that many of them were published.\"\n\nIf you're worried about how the food you're eating might be affecting you, health professionals say the best place to start is by keeping a detailed food and symptom diary, tracking what you're eating and how it makes you feel.

He called the legal saga and the inequity a \"wound on Confederation.\"\n\nIn a statement, Nalcor Energy, the parent company of Churchill Falls Corp., said it is disappointed with today's decision, but will continue to honour the contact and work cooperatively with Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\"Given the impacts that this contract has had on the province and the provincial treasury, every legal avenue was explored in both the Quebec court and the Supreme Court of Canada to see the province benefit from its natural resources.

(Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\nIn the 17th century, a German alchemist named Hennig Brand had a dream \u2014 of extracting gold from urine. (They were similar in colour, after all.) He didn't succeed, but he did discover the element phosphorus.\n\nCanadian biotechnology entrepreneur Luna Yu is on a similar quest. Her Toronto-based company, Genecis, aims to turn organic waste like apple cores, chicken bones and soiled tissues into valuable materials. I wrote about the company's work to turn kitchen waste into plastics for food packaging. But its ultimate goal is even more profitable products, such as cosmetics.\n\nRight now, Yu says, green-binnables aren't reaching their full potential, \"which is why organic waste is still getting sent to landfills.\"\n\nCanadian municipalities do try to squeeze a little extra value out of the waste before composting by using anaerobic digesters to extract biogas (i.e. gases produced by the breakdown of organic matter without oxygen), which can be burned to generate heat and electricity. Yu interned at a company that did that, and she realized that turning waste into biogas is an \"uneconomic way of dealing with it.\"\n\nThe trick is creating alternatives. Alchemists thought the key was a mythical tool called the philosopher's stone, which could turn lead into gold. The modern-day equivalent is bacteria, both natural and genetically modified, that can transform simple molecules into more complex chemicals.\n\nDifferent bacteria can make different chemicals in different ways. To have as many options as possible, Yu got friends to collect bacteria from all over the world. For example, they'd put some lake water in a little vial while on vacation in places like Guatemala and sneak the microbes back to Canada. Since the incorporation of Genecis, all work has been conducted using non-pathogenic bacteria sourced locally. Yu hopes to expand and improve what the bacteria can do by genetically modifying them (a concept known as synthetic biology).\n\nGenecis's first product will be premium compostable plastics called PHAs, which are used in things like medical devices. Yu says PHAs can generate seven times more revenue than biogas.\n\nNext, they have their eye on ambroxides, which are pricey perfume ingredients that were originally found in the intestines of sperm whales but can now be made synthetically. Turning stinky green-bin waste into something that smells so amazing you'd wear it on a date - now, that would be real alchemy.\n\n\u2014 Emily Chung\n\nClimate change and cities: What are the major risks?\n\nBig cities like Calgary need to find ways to mitigate flooding, among other effects of climate change. (Larry MacDougal/Canadian Press)\n\nThe effects of climate change \u2014 from torrential rains to massive forest fires \u2014 are not just obvious in southeast Asia or the southern U.S. They're being felt in Canadian cities. Nicole Mortillaro asked Blair Feltmate, head of the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, what cities can do to reduce the risk of extensive damage.\n\nBF: Relative to the most costly form of extreme weather risk within cities \u2013 which is basement flooding \u2014 as a top priority cities should implement programs that focus on home flood risk assessment. These programs would consist of properly trained people meeting with homeowners at their door, and over the course of a 10-minute conversation, provide the homeowner with basic guidance on 10 steps the homeowner could take around the outside of their property, and within the basement, that would lower their risk of basement flooding.\n\nRelative to problems associated with freezing rain \u2013 which for example has proven to be repeatedly problematic in New Brunswick in recent years \u2013 within cities, tree-trimming programs should be deployed to prevent ice-laden branches from falling on hydro lines. In most cases within cities, it is not the ice on the lines that proves problematic, but rather ice-encrusted branches that fall onto electric wires.\n\nRelative to forest fires affecting homes and communities in forested regions, there is one answer \u2014 large-scale deployment of the FireSmart program. The FireSmart program \u2013 which was originally developed in Alberta, and has since benefited from the expertise of all provinces and territories \u2014 focuses on pre-emptive measures to limit the probability of a fire entering a town or city, and subsequently lowering the chances that homes will burn when in proximity to fire.\n\nExamples of the FireSmart program in action include establishing a fire-break around a town (e.g., by removing vegetation around the periphery of a town), and at the level of the house, installing fireproof shingles, siding and porches. Also, shrubs should not be planted, and wood should not be stored, within several metres of a house.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nThe Big Picture: The cities with the most tree cover\n\nTrees: what's not to love? They suck up carbon and beautify the outdoors. Bottom line: We need more of them. The World Economic Forum collaborated with MIT's Senseable Lab to create Treepedia, which shows which major cities provide the most tree coverage of the ground when viewed from above.

(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)\n\nBitcoin has been a subject of fascination in recent years as an alternative currency and an investment opportunity \u2014 as well as a growing strain on the planet's resources.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is based on blockchain, a complicated computing process that maintains a ledger of transactions. Creating new bitcoins (through a process known as \"mining\") requires a lot of server power, which in turn requires a lot of electricity. In an interview with our colleagues at CBC Radio's Spark last year, an economist in Holland pointed out that authenticating a single bitcoin transaction takes as much electricity as running a washing machine 200 times. Yowza.\n\nAnd bitcoin is only becoming more popular.\n\nA new study by the journal Nature Climate Change said that bitcoin alone could produce enough carbon emissions to push global warming above 2 C in less than three decades.\n\nThis has alarmed environmentalists (while giving bitcoin skeptics another reason to hate it). But some analysts have said the analysis is flawed \u2014 and that bitcoin may not in fact roast the planet.\n\nThe study points out, for example, that much of the bitcoin being mined relies on coal power in Asia. But as the news site Axios writes, the study's projections \"assume that the fuel types used to generate electricity will remain the same as they are today.\" And that is unlikely to be the case.\n\nFor one thing, more operators of bitcoin farms could be prodded to move to less carbon-intensive regions. While coal and natural gas are still major sources of energy in many countries, rapid growth in renewables such as wind and solar worldwide suggests that if bitcoin continues to be a going concern, its carbon footprint is likely to become a less significant issue.\n\n\u2014 Andre Mayer\n\nStay in touch!\n\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?

That could cause some problems for sure,\" said Lyon.\n\nJeremy Potvin, CEO and co-founder at Weedbox, which markets the Radiate product, initially blamed what's \"clearly a mistake\" on the OCS, suggesting the province's distributor may have posted incorrect information about the product.\n\nHowever, on Friday, TerrAscend Canada, which actually produces Radiate, said it made the mistake, not the OCS.\n\n\"An incorrect description for one product was provided by TerrAscend Canada for the Ontario Cannabis Store website,\" said Ari Unterman, a vice president with the company.\n\nUnterman said TerrAscend immediately alerted the OCS and is taking steps to stop this from happening again.\n\nRadiate, a product marketed by Weedbox Inc., was listed as 24 per cent THC on the OCS website. But it's producer says that's due to a mistake it made, and the real THC content is 13 per cent.

But he has also been accused of fuelling racist, misogynistic and anti-Semitic views, in particular while chairman of the far-right Breitbart News Network, which he once described as \"the platform for the alt-right.\"\n\nBannon has denied that he is a white nationalist and that the anti-establishment alt-right movement is inherently racist, although he has conceded it may attract racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic elements.\n\nAs Trump's chief strategist and the man credited for overseeing the U.S. president's victory, Bannon, for a time, held a significant position of power. But things began to unravel soon after he departed the White House last year.\n\nHe rejoined Breitbart News but was forced to step down as CEO earlier in January after his criticisms of Trump and his family were published in a book by author Michael Wolff.\n\nHe has since been travelling through Europe, trying to drum up support for a new organization, The Movement, that seeks to advise and advocate for right-wing populist parties across the continent.\n\nDropped by New Yorker\n\nBannon recently made headlines after the New Yorker, which had planned to interview Bannon at the magazine's annual festival, dropped him following outrage over his attendance.\n\nNow in the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre that left 11 dead, critics \u2014 including the federal NDP and a coalition of more than 40 community groups advocating against racism \u2014 are calling for tonight's debate to be scrapped.\n\nThe coalition opposes the presence of both Bannon and Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, who has come under criticism in the past for his role in that administration and its controversial decision to invade Iraq in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nBannon was chief strategist for Donald Trump and is largely credited for overseeing his victory.

There is another way.\n\nOur devoted prime minister gingerly broached the subject recently with a group of students in the hallowed halls of Parliament. \"We try and stay, you know, serious and respectful,\" he said of his government's conduct in the House of Commons. \"They like to shout,\" he said, referring to the men and women across the aisle. \"That's something that happens naturally in opposition.\"\n\nWatch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tells students that opposition members \"like to shout.\"\n\nPM speaking to students on Parliament Hill 0:17\n\nYou see, children, the anger and aggression typically comes from those other pieces of sh\u2014 er \u2026 from those other people. The government \u2014 this government especially \u2014 makes proper decorum a priority. Indeed, the prime minister himself is present in question period every Wednesday so that he may directly offer the vacuous platitudes prepared in response to important questions.\n\nIt is with reverence to the institution that he deflects questions about Statistics Canada trying to collect Canadians' private banking data without their consent, or about his government's role in the breach of trust case involving Vice-Admiral Mark Norman, or about his own ethical lapses. This is the mark of a \"serious and respectful\" government, one that knows where the buck ultimately stops: with the previous government.\n\nWhile the opposition shouts from across the aisle, the government is working hard to make Canada better. Sometimes that requires standing up and charging against regressive forces \u2014 even literally. Or raising a middle finger to those stoking divisions \u2014 again, even literally. It's not that they want to resort to obscene gestures or name-calling, of course, but sometimes there is simply no other option. Even David had to use his slingshot once in a while, and in Canada, negative politics is a Goliath.\n\nHere's what the Prime Minister said to reporters regarding his comments in Question Period today, calling the opposition ambulance chasers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#cdnpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/cufRoQ4eVd\">pic.twitter.com/cufRoQ4eVd</a> \u2014@iamSas\n\nYou might be a bit young to remember, but let me tell you: we do not want to go back to the Harper days of government opaqueness and secrecy \u2014 when it would take months, even years, to see Access to Information requests fulfilled; when millions of dollars of taxpayer funds were doled out with little oversight or official record; when major policy decisions were buried in dense government documents for journalists to discover, rather than simply disclosed publicly.\n\nBut thankfully, those days are gone. Sure, under the Trudeau government, we still wait months, even years, for Access to Information requests to be fulfilled; and millions of dollars of taxpayer funds are still occasionally unaccounted for; and major policy decisions are buried rather than explained to the public, despite what the Liberals promised during their bid for government. But now, that opaqueness and secrecy comes with a smile. That's the salient point in all of this: the government means well.\n\nIndeed, that is the difference between this government and the last, and it's one we should be mindful of as the next election draws ever nearer: the Liberals don't want to be mean. They still believe in positive politics. It's just that those petty and childish guys across the aisle \u2014 led by \"Stephen Harper with a smile,\" which some person once coined \u2026 I can't recall who \u2014 make the execution of sunny ways more difficult than anticipated.\n\n'Getting a lot done for middle-class Canadians'\n\nSo you see, the Liberal government has to do things like table 850-page omnibus budget bills \u2014 even though they lambasted the previous government for doing so and promised they would abandon the \"undemocratic\" practice \u2014 because they aren't getting any help from the people occupying the other seats. The Harper omnibus bills were sinister and sneaky and tried to ram through changes without debate. This, on the other hand, is about \"getting a lot done for middle-class Canadians.\" See the difference?\n\nThe Trudeau government does not operate out of naked self-interest. Deep down, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer knows that. And NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will come to know that when the Trudeau government finally decides to call the byelection that will get him a shot at a seat in Parliament. The government is just very busy, as we all know, and probably hasn't gotten around to it yet. It's just a workflow thing.\n\nSo remember, children: there are forces of darkness and light, of division and unity, of hatred and of love.

I'm so emotionally hurt.\"\n\nWhile WestJet wouldn't comment on the specifics of the case, it said it stands by the crew's decisions. The airline also referenced federal aviation regulations, which state that airlines, at their discretion, can deny boarding to any passenger who shows signs that they could pose a safety risk.\n\n\"It is the crew's duty to assess and refuse anyone who may not be fit to fly,\" said WestJet spokesperson Lauren Stewart.\n\nDoing so, she said, prevents the risk of a more serious medical incident while in flight.\n\nWake-up call\n\nBennett said he took a doctor-prescribed sleeping pill shortly before the family's connecting flight from Toronto to Cayo Coco, Cuba because he was tired and suffering from leg pain.\n\nOnce on board, he fell asleep in the lap of his wife, Josefa Sapelino. A flight attendant told Sapelino to wake Bennett, but she said she decided not to bother him when he didn't respond to a light nudge.\n\n\"He wanted to sleep; I don't worry about it,\" she said.\n\nPassenger Shelley Hickey, from St. John's, was seated across the aisle from the family. She said the flight attendant returned, adamant that Sapelino wake Bennett prior to takeoff.\n\n\"She said he had to be awake in case they had some kind of an air flight accident \u2014 he had to be alert,\" said Hickey.\n\nAfter some more nudging from his wife, Bennett was awake and alert within five minutes, Hickey said.\n\nThe crew then recruited a passenger who was a nurse to assess Bennett. \"She said that he was fine,\" said Hickey.\n\nBut paramedics soon arrived with a wheelchair and removed Bennett from the plane, despite his pleas that he wasn't ill and had simply taken a sedative.\n\nWestJet stands by its crew's decision, saying it was done in the name of safety.

He plans to take WestJet to court to fight for compensation and an apology.\n\n\"You just can't treat people like that,\" he said.\n\nThe Canadian Transportation Agency said if passengers feel they've been unjustly denied boarding, they can file a complaint with the quasi-judicial regulator.", "With no immediate relief in sight from a collapse in Canadian oil prices, Alberta oilsands companies are beginning to turn down the taps and produce less oil.\n\nLow prices for Canadian crude are causing a chill throughout the industry \u2014 from the oil majors, to the small service companies.\n\nCenovus announced on Wednesday it would limit its oil output by an unspecified amount, while Canadian Natural Resources followed on Thursday by stating it has already cut production by up to 15,000 barrels per day and could increase that figure to as much as 55,000 this month and in December.\n\nCanadian prices crashed in September because of a backlog of oil in Alberta. The Fort McMurray region has increased production throughout this year, but export pipelines are full and several refineries in the U.S. which process heavy oil from Alberta, have shut down for maintenance in recent months.\n\nThe refineries will begin operating again shortly, but prices may take much longer to recover because of how much oil is produced and in storage in Alberta and how little space is available to export the crude.\n\n\"You're going to have to shut in production at some point in the coming months to balance supply and demand,\" Jon Morrison with CIBC World Markets, told a recent conference in Calgary.\n\nThe amount of oil transported by rail is increasing every month in Canada and setting new records along the way. In August, nearly 230,000 barrels were moved per day by trains, according to the National Energy Board.\n\nAccording to Morrison, that figure has to reach 500,000 barrels by the end of the year for prices to improve. However, he expects it may only reach about 400,000.\n\n\"That still leaves you with too much crude,\" said Morrison. \"Prices collapse until producers shut in production to balance supply and demand.\"\n\nCenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix is challenging the rest of the oilpatch to do just that.\n\n\"The industry right now has a production problem,\" he said on a conference call with investors. \"We are going to do our part, but we are not going to carry the industry on our back.

Independent senators can amend bills or propose changes without facing retribution from partisan bosses.\n\nThis freedom is apparent in the number of government bills that have been amended by the upper house in this session \u2014 14 out of 53 so far. Only a handful of bills were changed by the Senate under the former Conservative government.\n\nThe Senate has pushed for changes to the Liberal government's overhaul of the Transportation Act (which prompted considerable lobbying activity from railway companies), its plain-packaging tobacco regulations, the Cannabis Act, citizenship laws and new political financing rules, among other items of legislation. The government has accepted many of the Senate amendments.\n\nSo it's really no surprise that the number of meetings between senators and lobbyists (or \"communications,\" to use the term preferred by the lobbying commissioner) has ballooned from 472 in 2014 to well over 2,000 in the last 12 months, according to the latest statistics from the lobbyists' registry.\n\nGroups ranging from the Western Nova Scotia Lobster Dealers and the Davie Shipyard to the Mining Association of Canada and the Mennonite Central Committee have been clamouring for face time with senators studying and debating consequential legislation.\n\n'Best practices'\n\nAccording to the agenda of a recent Independent Senators Group (ISG) team meeting, obtained by CBC News, senior ISG senators discussed \"lobbyist participation in Senate committee activities.\"\n\nThat followed a claim by Independent Quebec Sen. Raymonde Saint-Germain that lobbyists have been given \"too much time and too much importance\" in Red Chamber committee meetings. She's called for more \"independent experts\" and \"people who bring added value.\"\n\nIndependent B.C. Sen. Yuen Pau Woo, leader of the ISG, said the Independent senators are now trying to craft a set of \"best practices\" to handle lobbying requests. Partly, the senators simply want to manage their time better, Woo said \u2014 but they also want to maintain their independence in the face of \"pressure\" from government relations professionals to change legislation.\n\nWoo said that while Independent senators don't have to deal with the strictures that come with being a member of a party caucus, they still don't want to feel beholden to lobbyists and the interests they represent.\n\n\"Many of us are relatively new in the Senate and we take very seriously the idea that non-partisan, independent Senate should not only be non-partisan and independent in practice but also in appearance. And the way we interact with lobbyists could affect the appearance of our independence,\" Woo said in an interview with CBC News.\n\nWoo said Independent senators do not want an over-reliance on lobbyist input at committee \u2014 where senators can best exercise their \"sober second thought\" function \u2014 to \"erode public confidence in the work of the Senate.\"\n\n\"While it's perfectly legitimate for us to listen to the views of lobbyists, we should at all times strive for balance, for a diversity of views and for a deliberate, careful approach to evaluating legislation that's in the best interest of Canadians,\" he said.\n\nWoo did not say exactly how the Independents might limit the intensity of lobbying activity in Senate circles. He said the conversation among ISG members is still ongoing.\n\nIt is also not entirely clear how the ISG \u2014 which holds a majority in the Senate but is still just one of the parliamentary groups \u2014 would go about policing lobbying activity, which is already governed by the Lobbying Act.\n\nMoreover, the witnesses called before committees typically are chosen by a three-member steering committee composed of one senator from the ISG, one Conservative and one Liberal caucus. In other words, it's not up to a single group to overhaul longstanding committee practices.\n\nI'm not surprised senators are feeling overwhelmed. - Lobbyist Philip Cartwright\n\nAnd while the word \"lobbyists\" might conjure up negative connotations in the minds of some voters, lobbyists are often people who know a great deal about a particular piece of legislation and an industry.\n\nPhilip Cartwright, a lobbyist at Global Public Affairs and the president of the Government Relations Institute of Canada, said lobbyists are part of Ottawa's political ecosystem.\n\n\"I'm not surprised senators are feeling overwhelmed. There's lot of big legislation in the system, and legislation that matters,\" he said.\n\n\"But, that aside, advocacy is enshrined in law as an important part of the democratic process and good public policy and better informed public policy and law and regulation comes from engaging with people on the outside. It's critically important work.\"\n\n'A complete infringement of our rights'\n\nWhile protecting their clients' bottom lines, he said, lobbyists also offer politicians practical advice, flag provisions that might be unworkable, point out unintended consequences and offer recommendations to close loopholes. And not all lobbying is corporate; some lobbyists are employed by not-for-profit organizations and charities.\n\nCartwright said his organization would vigorously fight any effort to formally curtail lobbyists' access to parliamentarians.\n\n\"It would be a complete infringement of our rights. And not our rights as registered lobbyists but the right of any Canadian to be able to access government in a fair and transparent way,\" he said.\n\nHe said the group representing lobbyists, the Government Relations Institute of Canada, is willing to work with the ISG and other senators to find ways to streamline the work.", "Can't find any weed to buy for a party this weekend?

(Gosia Wozniacka/The Associated Press)\n\nThe industry is under stress during a time of transition to try to increase staff and respond to overwhelming recreational demand.\n\n\"Medicinal patients are and will be our priority,\" Rewak said. \"Every company that's part of our membership is working seven days a week, 24 hours a day to make sure the supplies get out the door.\"\n\nLack of transparency\n\nDespite the assurances of some providers that they will put their medicinal pot users first, O'Hara says he's not satisfied with the industry's reassurances.\n\n\"No one's really communicating with patients and saying, 'Hey look, in 12 weeks or six weeks or three weeks, you're gonna be fine.' That contributes to the anxiety that patients have, because they're now in a realm where they just don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nWakefield agrees.\n\n\"They're not being very transparent,\" he said. \"No solutions are coming from the LPs (licensed producers), no one is saying, 'This is what we're doing to improve this.'\"\n\nHe's also not impressed with the government's treatment of medical patients.\n\n\"Health Canada is very hands-off with this, and that's very frustrating,\" he said.\n\nIn an email to CBC, a spokesperson for Health Canada said that at the end of September 2018, licensed producers had reported that they had inventory of more than 90,000 kilograms of dried cannabis and 41,000 litres of cannabis oil.\n\n\"In contrast, preliminary estimates of retail sales to date from publicly available information, while strong, represent only a small fraction of that available inventory,\" the agency said.\n\nIf that's the case, the trouble experienced by many medical patients remains a mystery.\n\n\n\n\"We never had any complaints about delivery before legalization,\" says O'Hara. \"What's changed? Only one thing.\"", "The tweet at the top of U.S. President Donald Trump's Twitter page yesterday was the nub of his closing argument for the midterm elections: A vote for Democrats is a vote for cop-killing foreign invaders.\n\nThe actual tweet \u2014 \"It is outrageous what Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now! Vote.GOP\"\u2014 appears above a campaign ad.\n\nThe ad features Luis Bracamontes, a twice-deported Mexican immigrant who murdered two police officers in California. Bracamontes's self-satisfied sneer is made more ominous by a montage of non-white people struggling to force their way through gates and barricades at what looks like a border somewhere \u2014 the exact location isn't clear.\n\nAs usual, there is nothing remotely subtle about the tweet, and as soon as Trump fired it into the Twittersphere it set off a predictable argument.\n\nSome called it the most racist political ad since the infamous 1988 spot about rapist Willie Horton that played on whites' fears of violent crime and African-American stereotypes. Others said it was a fact-based ad drawing attention to a real and dangerous threat.\n\nThus the ad instantly served its purpose: Americans were fighting among themselves. The fight was the point.\n\n'Racialized economics'\n\nRacial division was vital to Trump's 2016 election victory and he has always known better than most the political value of baiting people to pick a side on race.\n\nSo no one should be surprised that Trump has reached for the same divisive tactic now that Republicans see their control of Congress threatened in next week's elections.\n\nFraming Trump's 2016 win around \"identity\" has been controversial since the election. The suggestion that it was Trump's appeal to racial insecurity that propelled him to the White House is wounding to his supporters and offensive to those who prefer the more generous explanation that Trump connected with the economic insecurity of \"flyover\" America's forgotten men and women.\n\nTrump supporters celebrate his election victory back in 2016. The president seems convinced he can get his base out to the polls in the midterms on Nov. 6 by focusing on immigration and border security. (Ronda Churchill/Associated Press)\n\nBut a new book by a trio of political scientists makes a compelling case that not only was racial and ethnic identity the central explanation for Trump's success in 2016, the economy itself had also come to divide Americans along partisan lines and with a racial tinge.\n\nIn other words, under President Barack Obama, Republicans had much less favourable opinions about the economy than Democrats had and they came to view it through a racial and ethnic lens.\n\nThe economy was building momentum in the latter part of Barack Obama's presidency, but many Trump supporters didn't see it that way. (John Gress/Reuters)\n\nThe book, Identity Crisis, written by John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck, has a much more detailed argument supported by heaps of post-election data.\n\nBut at its heart is a discovery that \"the important sentiment underlying Trump's support was not 'I might lose my job' but, in essence, 'People in my group are losing jobs to that other group.' Instead of a pure economic anxiety, what mattered was racialized economics.\"\n\nSo rather than argue it was either racial anxiety or economic anxiety, they write that \"racial anxiety was, arguably, driving economic anxiety.\"\n\nGood economy, bad campaign\n\nThat helps to make sense of Trump's choices for his current campaign strategy.\n\nThe president has often bragged that he has improved the economy, claiming his cutting of taxes and regulations is responsible for lower unemployment, higher GDP growth and a roaring stock market. Democrats say that's debatable, but what's notable is that Trump hasn't been running on his economic record anyway.\n\nThe simple explanation is that running on a good economy rarely works.\n\nAs campaign strategist Dick Morris says, Trump seemed to make a strategic shift away from the economy as an issue during the summer \u2014 at about the time when Morris publicly advised him in a Breitbart column that a good economy wouldn't help him in the midterms.\n\nTrump supporters cheer at a campaign rally in Estero, Fla., on Halloween.

(Maaz Khan/Museum of Illusions Toronto)\n\nAs traditional art institutions struggle to attract patrons, these new funhouse-like cultural exhibits are easily drawing scores of visitors, who spread the word by blasting images of apparently joyful experiences out via social media. Timed viewing slots are often sold out weeks in advance, and tens of thousands of tickets are bought at upwards of $30 a pop.\n\nCritics call these newfangled pop-ups superficial diversions \u2014 heavy on the photo-op, light on depth. But are they also game-changing cultural experiences sending a message to traditional arts venues?\n\nTwo of these popular spaces are opening up in Canada this month: Happy Place is setting down for a two-month stay in Toronto's Harbourfront neighbourhood, and Museum of Illusions is opening a Toronto outpost with an eye toward further expansion to other Canadian cities.\n\nHappy Place got started in L.A. last year before moving on to Chicago. Toronto is its first international location. Museum of Illusion is a little older, and got its start in Croatia \u2014 and has already opened up in cities like Kuala Lumpur and New York.\n\nSome have likened the new experiential exhibits to headline-grabbing museum installations by major artists like Yayoi Kusama \u2014 whose boffo Infinity Mirrors show inspired massive queues online and in person (including in Toronto).\n\nThe Souls of Millions of Light Years Away is one of Yayoi Kusama's best known Infinity Mirror Room installations. Her works have drawn massive audiences to galleries and art museums around the globe. (Evan Mitsui/CBCNews)\n\nJared Paul, the creator of Happy Place, was inspired by the audience interactivity of Kusama's Infinity Mirrors exhibit but wanted to push it further. The result? A series of multi-sensory rooms and settings that, he hopes, will motivate visitors to set aside their worldly concerns for an hour or so and to simply dive in, perform and play.\n\n\"I wanted to lend my skills to something that is a little bit different, a show that we can actually experience and walk through,\" Paul said this week, ahead of Thursday's opening of Happy Place's Toronto location.\n\nJared Paul, creator of the hit immersive experience Happy Place and a live entertainment producer, says, 'We want people to have fun.

It's been a little bit of tough sledding here at the start, but I've been through it before. You just try to stick with it and you get rewarded like I did tonight.\"\n\nThe sequence leading up to Neal's goal began when rookie defenceman Juuso Valimaki caught Matt Calvert with a bodycheck at the blue line, turning the puck over.\n\n\"He timed it perfect and to be able to keep the puck in the zone, all in one shot. That was a real turning point, too,\" Giordano said. \"Really put them back on their heels and then we kept going.\"\n\nCalgary began its comeback 47 seconds into the third on Elias Lindholm's power-play goal, his team-leading ninth goal of the season.\n\nThe man advantage was the result of a charging major on Ian Cole late in the second period after his heavy hit crumpled Mark Jankowski as he was looking back for a pass. Shaken up, Jankowski went to the dressing room. Deemed healthy post-game, he returned to sit on the bench in the third period, but did not play.\n\nIt was the response to the hit from Sam Bennett, who immediately fought Cole, that the players pointed to as the game's turning point.\n\n\"He's a feisty little kid. He definitely knows how to throw them,\" said Backlund. \"That gave the team some momentum and some energy. Great job by him stepping up for the team and for Janko.

In Pakistan only four per cent of children were getting a \"minimally acceptable diet,\" it said, citing a government survey.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of malnourished people in the region has begun to rise, especially in East and Southeast Asia, with almost no improvement in the past several years.\n\nThe prevalence of wasting is above the threshold of public health concern in three of every four countries in the region - UN Food and Agricultural Organization\n\nIn the longer term, rates of malnutrition did fall from nearly 18 per cent in 2005 to 11 per cent in 2017, but hunger-related stunting that causes permanent impairment is worsening due to food insecurity and inadequate sanitation, with 79 million children younger than five-years-old across the region affected, the report said.\n\nThe high risks also are reflected in the prevalence in wasting among very young children, a dangerous rapid weight loss related to illness or a lack of food, it said. The condition is seen most often in India and other parts of South Asia but also in Indonesia, Malaysia and Cambodia, affecting almost one in 10 children in Southeast Asia and 15 per cent of children in South Asia.\n\n\"The prevalence of wasting is above the threshold of public health concern in three of every four countries in the region,\" it said.\n\nConversely, even overweight children often are malnourished if their families rely on inexpensive street foods that are oily, starchy and sweet, but unhealthy and sometimes unsafe.\n\nLack of clean water a major issue\n\nThe report focused on two main factors that often contributed to food insecurity: climate-related disasters and inadequate access to clear water and sanitation.\n\nIts authors said that providing adequate clean drinking water and sanitation were crucial for preventing illnesses that further undermine health, especially among children. It also lauded efforts in some countries to ensure city dwellers have access to fresh food markets.\n\nIn Indonesia, for example, a study cited in the report found that the prevalence of stunting correlated very closely with access to improved latrines. Children whose families relied on untreated water were more than thrice as likely to be stunted if their homes lacked such latrines, it said.\n\nWhile access to drinking water is widespread it has stopped improving and actually decreased in urban areas, the report said.\n\nA homeless man sleeps on the floor of a market in Kampung Baru, Malaysia, one of the countries included in the UN report on hunger and malnutrition.

Instead they have unfortunately decided to engage in fear mongering and demonizing of asylum seekers, which is not what Canada is all about,\" said Hussen in an interview with CBC News Network's Power & Politics.\n\nThe minister was responding to a news release from the Ontario government that said the federal government does not have a \"credible\" plan to deal with asylum seekers crossing into Canada.\n\nThe press release also quoted Ontario's minister responsible for immigration, Lisa MacLeod, as saying \"In Toronto, approximately 40 per cent of shelter occupants are refugees.\"\n\nHussen dismissed that number saying, \"The figures that are being thrown around are not based on facts. They are based on speculation,\"\n\nHe went on to criticise MacLeod directly saying she has called asylum seekers names.\n\nHe is a name calling bully.

They are saying there is a crisis there. We have numbers that show in 2017 25% of those occupants were refugees and in 2016 it was just 11%.\n\nHussen: Lisa MacLeod is engaged in fear mongering and using this issue to demonize people.\n\nKapelos: What evidence do you have for that?\n\nHussen: I'll tell you, the Toronto shelter system does not ask questions on the status of those who are seeking shelter in their system.\n\nImmigration Minister Ahmed Hussen joined Power & Politics Wednesday to discuss the Liberal government's plan to boost annual immigration targets. Hussen also discusses the challenges of housing asylum seekers in Toronto. 12:25\n\nKapelos: So her department is lying when they say that they are 40 per cent of the people?\n\nHussen: How would Lisa MacLeod know who is accessing the system if the temporary housing shelter system in Toronto does not collect stats based on status? Number one.\n\nKapelos: Wasn't [Toronto Mayor] John Tory also saying that though as well? Is he lying too?\n\nHussen: No I'm saying that the figures that are being thrown around are not based on facts. They are based on speculation...the status of people seeking access to the shelter system in Toronto is unknown, therefore to put a number on that, is simply not factual.\n\nKapelos: So you're saying that her department is not factual when they say that 46% of those occupants\u2026\n\nHussen: I'm saying that it doesn't withstand scrutiny and the record of Lisa MacLeod speaks for itself. She has not engaged in our plan to engage with the city of Toronto to triage asylum seekers away from Toronto by regionalizing the issue so that we can have other cities step in to work together.\n\n\u200b\n\nKapelos: Explain what you mean by that?\n\nHussen: What I mean by that is Canadians expect all orders of government to work together when we have challenges. On the issue of asylum seekers, the federal government has stepped up. We have provided not only funding through the Canada social transfer; we've provided additional funding of $50 million dollars, $11 million of which will go to Toronto and Ontario to deal with this issue. Now we had a plan in place to work through Ontario and Toronto to conduct a triage system that will relieve pressure from the city of Toronto. The province of Ontario chose to walk away from that system. We're still at the table. We're working with the city of Toronto to triage people away and we have successfully done that to the city of Chatham, Ontario, and others, to relieve pressure from Toronto. So, we're there. We're providing not only funding, but we're actually bringing solutions to the table. The government of Ontario is not doing that. They are not engaged. Instead they have unfortunately decided to engage in fear mongering and demonizing of asylum seekers, which is not what Canada is all about.\n\nKapelos: Do you feel that John Tory also demonized asylum seekers, because he raised the exact same concerns, to be fair?\n\n\u200b\n\nHussen: No. I engaged John Tory on that and I told him we will always be there for the city of Toronto. The difference between John Tory and Lisa MacLeod is that minister MacLeod has called asylum seekers names.\n\nKapelos: What has she called them?\n\nHussen: She has labelled all of them as economic immigrants. She's said that none of them are genuine refugees. Which is something that we trust our immigration refugee board to do. And so, we have to respect the system that we have. We have mechanisms in place.\n\nKapelos: You're saying that Lisa MacLeod said not a single asylum seeker is a genuine refugee. When did she say that?\n\nHussen: She said on her twitter \u2014 that these are economic migrants, that they are not genuine refugees. So this is factual. It's on the record. But the fact of the matter is, the IRB [Immigration and Refugee Board] is in charge of determining who is a genuine refugee and who is not and we have to respect the independence of the immigration refugee board. Those who are determined to be refugees will stay in Canada. Those who are not will be asked to leave our country. That is part of our law.\n\nKapelos: Critics are saying that your government's plan is not adequately working, that this is not a sustainable way to manage this issue.\n\n\u200b\n\nHussen: It's fair to have concerns about asylum seekers, but the fact of the matter is, the numbers have gone down 75 per cent, so if our plan was not working, why have the numbers gone down\u2026\n\nKapelos: Actually the numbers are up.\n\nHussen: I'm talking about the numbers compared to last year.\n\nKapelos: You're talking month to month. If you're talking year-over-year there's actually more asylum seekers that have crossed into Canada this time this year compared to this time last year, overall.\n\nHussen: What Canadians expect us to do is to work with all orders of government to make sure that when challenges present themselves, we come up with solutions that each level of government is able to implement. The federal government is there. We've worked very closely with the city of Toronto. We were willing to engage the province of Ontario, they decided not to be part of the solution. We haven't left the city of Toronto on its own. We've provided not only money but a triage system to triage people away from the city of Toronto while they wait for the hearings. We have to let the system take its course we've signed international agreements that are part of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to allow asylum seekers at least to get a fair hearing, so that those who are deemed to be genuine refugees can be determined to be so, and those who are not can be determined by the same independent system. That is the system that we have and that is the system that we remain committed to.\n\nThis Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.", "Paul Davis bid farewell to politics on Thursday.

It finds that sea levels seem to be rising faster and higher than previous models predicted, while surface temperatures creep ever higher.\n\nThe report also suggests, that despite anecdotal reports some sea star species are recovering from a devastating wasting disease, these important ocean creatures have shown no measurable signs of a rebound.\n\n\"The impacts of our activities extend far beyond human population centres,\" says the report, titled \"Ocean Watch: B.C.

More recent research suggests these numbers, considered extreme at the time, are now conservative. (Coastal Ocean Research Institute)\n\nThe report points out the B.C. government has planned for a 0.5-metre rise in sea levels by 2050, and one metre by 2100, but, \"new science suggests that may not be enough.\"\n\nThat's because February 2017 estimates from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggest that global sea levels could rise by up to 2.5 metres by the end of the century.\n\nThe major driver of this trend is rising temperatures caused by climate change, and satellite data suggests the sea's surface on the west coast is warming by about 0.1 degrees Celsius per decade.\n\nAnnual average sea surface temperature in the Canadian Pacific Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) based on satellite data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Without the sea stars, mussels explode in abundance, out-competing other invertebrates for space and resources.\n\nThe result is a decline in biodiversity, according to the report.\n\nResearchers at Simon Fraser University have already shown how a massive drop-off in sunflower sea star populations has led to a decline in some of B.C.'s kelp forests.

The AER increased the ratio to 2.0 or higher two years ago so the value of active wells owned by a company must be double the cost of reclaiming them when they are no longer producing.\n\nIn his presentation, Wadsworth asked rhetorically why has there been no political will to change liability programs in Alberta.\n\n\"Until recently, the implications of our flawed system had not been realized.

His suitcase and jacket were still laying there, but Cam was nowhere to be found.\n\nThey thought maybe he called for a ride and went into town, so they didn't really raise any suspicion until Sunday. That was Thursday night. The family or sheriff's office definitely didn't get notified until Sunday night, the 7th, that he was missing.\n\nQ: What are the theories about what happened?\n\nA: We've had a wide range. We've had psychics reach out to us. We've had family members tell us stuff and friends tell us stuff.\n\nIt's anywhere from foul play to the possibility that he's got amnesia or he's had a breakdown and is wandering.\n\nThe sheriff's office are searching a creek, that's pretty long and deep \u2014 they've been searching that pretty hard, because his cellphone and credit cards and money \u2014 nothing's been used since that night. There's been no activity whatsoever.\n\nThe theories are that maybe he was kidnapped. Maybe a mental breakdown.\n\nThe family obviously are holding on to any hope. They don't want to give up on him. Nobody would. It's worth chasing down any little lead.\n\nAlso, I just had a meeting the other day with the sheriff's office and got a debrief, and they're still focused on that creek.\n\nWe talk to private investigator Mike Toth in Billings Montana who's on the case of Cam Collins, missing for nearly a month. 6:42\n\nQ: The reward has been doubled, to $10,000 US. Does that help or hurt?\n\nA: It helps. Even when we met with the sheriff about doing it \u2014 we figured if there was some foul play, that that would generate some tips, that somebody would say something for that type of money.\n\nSo far, nobody has come forward with anything super substantial that we can sink our teeth into.\n\nWith files from the Calgary Eyeopener.", "B.C.'s premier has revealed his vote in the provincial referendum that could change the electoral system.\n\nDuring a news conference Thursday, John Horgan confirmed that he voted in favour of proportional representation.\n\nHe went on: \"I voted to select the option of mixed-member [proportional], because it is the most widely used internationally. That gives us the baseline to work from.\"\n\nUnder a mixed-member proportional system, or MMP, voters would select one candidate from one party, and the person with the most votes would get elected \u2014 just like in the current system.\n\nBut in each region of the province, there would also be extra proportional representation MLAs, allocated by how well the party did in that region overall. The system would result in 60 per cent of members of the legislature being elected by the most votes and 40 per cent from lists set by political parties.\n\nThe other two potential systems under consideration are dual-member proportional, which would involve large ridings represented by two politicians, including one with the most votes, and rural-urban proportional, which would be a blend of the MMP for rural ridings and the single transferable vote system for urban ridings.\n\nUnder STV, voters rank candidates in order of preference.\n\nVoters can also choose to stick with the current first-past-the-post system.\n\nThat's the option chosen by former NDP premiers Glen Clark and Ujjal Dosanjh.

Still standing together,\" Hirayama tweeted Oct. 13 above a photo of his team standing arm-in-arm on the field.\n\nThose in the sevens camp, whose ultimate goal is Olympic qualification, pointed to the different demands of the sevens game and said specialized training is needed. They also noted the rising popularity of the sevens game.\n\n'We're going to get left behind'\n\n\"It's 2018. 7s is no longer just a development tool.

Donahue and neighbour Doug Maguire \u2014 a physician and, like Donahue, an experienced canoeist \u2014 paddled into the frigid water, maintaining verbal contact with the man.\n\nHe kept complaining he couldn't feel his legs.

My concern was that he might be hypothermic and maybe beginning to lose consciousness,\" said Donahue.\n\n\"My biggest fear was hearing silence. The fact he kept yelling and screaming was a good thing,\" said Donahue.\n\nOnce they located the man, who appeared to have fallen out of a kayak, Donahue and Maguire knew enough to not try and lift him into the canoe. He was thrashing in panic and could cause the vessel to capsize.\n\nDonahue managed to hang on to the man's wrists to keep him afloat while Maguire paddled to shore.\n\n\"He was delirious. Terrified. He kept complaining he couldn't feel his legs. So I gathered he was getting to the point [that] had he been in the water much longer, I don't think he would have made it,\" recalls Donahue.\n\nMeanwhile, someone had called in the emergency and paramedics were guided to the scene of the dramatic rescue. Donahue and Maguire got the man to the shore, where he stumbled up the muddy and rocky riverbank near Churchill Drive.\n\nDonahue says the man didn't say a word to them. The canoeists went back onto the river to retrieve the kayak.\n\nBy the time they returned, the man was in the back of ambulance.\n\n'It's really foolhardy'\n\nDonahue says in retrospect, the incident seems odd. He can't figure out why someone would go in the river this time of year in the dark.\n\n\"It's really foolhardy.

The tax filings of every person and business become census income data. And the agency is on the verge of replacing the short-form census every Canadian is required to fill out every five years by merging data from existing government holdings \u2014 a massive project years in the making.\n\nBy law, the agency can ask for any information it wants from any source. During a briefing with reporters last month, senior officials said they planned to test the limits of the Statistics Act to tap new sources of information as survey response rates decline, undermining the accuracy of the agency's findings.\n\nThree senior officials \u2014 one overseeing information technology, a second in charge of labour, education and income statistics, and a third in charge of income statistics \u2014 defended the agency anew on Thursday during an online chat about the latest financial projects, outlined in privacy assessments posted to the Statistics Canada website, trying articulate why the data was needed.\n\nOne participant lamented that the lack of a clear explanation fuelled public skepticism about the project.\n\nMaintaining privacy\n\nThe Liberals stood behind the agency again Thursday under continued questioning from the Conservatives in the House of Commons, where allegations of state surveillance and authoritarian rule peppered the debate.\n\nArora said the concerns people have expressed with the banking information project require the agency to do a better job communicating with Canadians about what information it collects and how it protects it from release. He said Statistics Canada has worked with the privacy commissioner's office for the last year on the design of the project, but is willing to take more advice.\n\nFormer officials at the agency describe a culture where safeguarding data is drilled into every worker. Identifying information is separated out of files to protect privacy, and only a small group of analysts are able to access the data when it is needed to merge various data sets. But that might not be enough.\n\n\"Any record linkage is a de facto invasion of privacy,\" said Michael Wolfson, a former assistant chief statistician who left the agency in 2009. \"You knew that, but there was an offsetting public good. I think the world is changing, though.\"\n\nDoug Norris, chief demographer at private research firm Environics Analytics, who spent three decades at Statistics Canada, said the statistical system only survives with the confidence of Canadians. \"Maintaining privacy would be right in the centre of that. It's inherent and required by the agency.\"\n\nOverreaching\n\nLower costs and better data quality have prompted the agency's reach for more administrative data compiled by other organizations, such as the banking information, and were encouraged under the previous Conservative government, said former chief statistician Wayne Smith.\n\nHe said the agency might have overreached with its plans to get information from banks and years of credit histories and spooked Canadians whose information is being sought. That makes it harder for the agency to try similar projects in the future. Smith said he authorized similar, but less broad, projects under his tenure.\n\nSmith said he believes any new attempts to tap privately held data sources have to be gradual, to prove that each new move made sense, was cost effective, and provided relevant and important information for governments to use.\n\n\"You have to build up that confidence and that reputation. You can't just assume it's there and go off and demand things and not expect a backlash,\" he said.\n\nThe federal privacy commissioner plans to examine the limits of the agency's reach as part of a probe into its request for the banking data.\n\n\"I'm not against the collection, use and sharing of information to improve services, but I think that our current frameworks in Canada currently are lacking,\" privacy commissioner Daniel Therrien told the Commons ethics committee Thursday. \"Statistics Canada is arguing that they can do this without consent based on the current legal framework.\"\n\nHe warned that any government agency handling financial information needs to put careful safeguards around it.", "A ball hockey tournament in memory of a teenage player who died of tuberculosis earlier this year will give his community a much-needed chance to grieve, says the coach organizing the event.\n\n\"His passing affected a lot of people here in Nain, and I wanted to honour his memory,\" William Flowers, Gussie Bennett's former minor hockey coach, told Labrador Morning Wednesday.\n\nBennett, who was 14, died in St. John's in March, just two days after he went to the clinic in Nain with tuberculosis-related symptoms.\n\nHis death was a shock for the entire community, especially the young people he played with, Flowers said.\n\n\"Having this tournament is going to bring some closure to the kids that need closure, that never said goodbye to Gussie because they never had the chance,\" he said.\n\n'This would have been his year'\n\nBennett was a fixture at the local hockey arena, where Flowers coaches all the minor programs.\n\nAs a goaltender, he didn't play only with his own team, Flowers said.

So going forward in 2018, we are going to post our audited financial statements on the website and we are good with that,\" said Bean.\n\nReserves = Stability\n\nCharity Intelligence reviewed the Flames' financial statements for the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nOne of the group's concerns was the amount of money sitting in the foundation's reserve account.\n\nCharity Intelligence said the foundation put $1.2 million into the bank, boosting the non-profit's reserves to $7.8 million at the end of the 2017-2018 season.\n\n\"The Calgary Flames is a puck hog.

And I can assure everyone that, at the end of the day, all of those funds will be distributed to people in southern Alberta,\" said Bean.\n\nBean said a good example of being able to be flexible is the response last year to the fatal ammonia leak at the Fernie Memorial Arena in B.C.\n\n\"We were able to write a cheque right away to help get an outdoor rink built in Fernie,\" he said.\n\nBean said that since 1988, the Flames Foundation has distributed $32 million to charities throughout southern Alberta.\n\n\"So we don't think we're a puck hog, we don't think we're hoarding cash.\"\n\nNumbers disputed\n\nBean also disputed the watchdog's finding that the Flames Foundation gives only 30 cents for every dollar raised. He argued the rate of return is closer to 88 cents on the dollar.\n\nBean said that out of the nearly $4 million raised last year \u2014 which includes money from 50/50 draws, fundraising events and private donations \u2014 $500,000 was spent on operating costs, leaving the foundation $3.5 million to donate.\n\n\"I'm not going to get into a debate on math, I'm going to present how we look at our numbers,\" he said. \"It's in our annual report. It's on our website.\"\n\nCharity Intelligence said the annual report is not detailed, it doesn't break down all the revenues and expenses. It also said that 88 cents is incorrectly calculated.\n\nCharity Intelligence opted to not include 50/50 fundraising in its report because most people don't consider it a donation, and they realize only half of it will end up going to a cause.\n\nBut the watchdog said if it did include it, then it would have to take into account the total amount collected, minus the cash dispersed as the prize, and associated costs. In that case, the rate of return for dollar raised would have been around 40 cents, rather than the 30 cents it calculated in its report.\n\nAnd it said Bean is underestimating operating costs, and not including fundraising costs associated with its popular golf and poker events.\n\nCharity Intelligence said it stands by its evaluation, which is based on the foundation's financial statements and followup correspondence with the Flames Foundation to clarify some figures.\n\n\"We are happy to hear that they plan to publicly post their audited financial statements going forward.

The co-operative's many members paid between $50 and $250 for memberships.\n\n\"We were always surprised by the enthusiasm and number of people who felt connection with what was being done [at Moore Farm],\" said Berlanga, who's also head of Apicentris, which runs the City of Gatineau's urban beekeeping program and has hives at Moore Farm.\n\n\"We fell in love with the farm,\" he said. \"You're in the heart of the city, and you're suddenly in this oasis of beautiful countryside with amazing history.\"\n\nGardens to stay open\n\nThe NCC and City of Gatineau are promising to keep the community gardens at Moore Farm open to the public.\n\nThe NCC will now look for a new tenant for the former equestrian centre, which was bequeathed to it in the 1970s.\n\nWe continue to believe in the tourism, heritage and urban agricultural vocation of the Moore Farm Estate, and will work with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ville_gatineau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ville_gatineau</a> on future activities of the site while continuing to preserve public access to the community gardens. \u2014@NCC_CCN\n\nThe stable, a heritage building completed in 1910 in the Queen Anne's Revival style, was restored before the co-op took over.\n\nMoore Farm is one of 90 urban farms the NCC leases on federal lands in the National Capital Region.", "After a decade on the job, Leduc paramedic Sarah Baile talks about being afraid of her radio.\n\n\"You never know what it's going to bring through from the other side,\" she said. \"It could be a stubbed toe. It could be a pediatric drowning. It could be anything in between.\"\n\nHer story was part of the inspiration for the latest work of art by fellow paramedic Daniel Sundahl, a haunting depiction of the stigma attached to post-traumatic stress disorder and the mental-health challenges faced by first responders.\n\n\"I thought it was a very, very powerful image,\" said colleague, Tamara Osmak, who has been a paramedic for eight years. \"It is almost like a demon ... telling you to be quiet, don't speak.\"\n\n'Afraid to talk about it'\n\nOn Saturday night, first responders from across North America gathered at Enoch Cree Nation for the opening of Sundahl's peer recovery and resiliency symposium.\n\nThough talk about PTSD has become more acceptable in fire halls and EMS stations, Baile said the stigma remains.\n\n\"I think you can even tell from our body language,\" she said during an interview with CBC. \"We're both rigid, we're fidgeting, we're looking at each other constantly. We're even here, just alone with you, afraid to talk about it. And we're two of the ones that are more open about it.\"\n\nFor the symposium, the banquet room at the River Cree Resort was filled with work by several Alberta artists.

Hundreds of firefighters from across the province rushed to the northern city to help battle the fire known as \"the Beast.\"\n\nMany volunteer firefighters who helped out went back to communities where there was nothing in place to support them, said Jeff Sych, clinical director of the Alberta Critical Incident Provincial Network (ACIPN).\n\n\"We recognized that people were calling out for help,\" he said. \"We realized that people were missing their full-time job, that they were impacting families and there was nothing in place. We need to do more for the people who go running into the fires when the general population is running away from them.\"\n\nThe ACPIN was created to fill that need.\n\nThe volunteer, peer-driven program is just now getting off the ground. Over the past year, the network has trained 300 people. But there are more than 400 fire departments and 19,000 firefighters in the province.\n\n\"If you live in a large urban area, you probably have more access to care,\" said Sych. \"And so what we're trying to do is to fill the gaps in the smaller areas, the more remote areas.\"\n\nThe program was started with a small grant from the Alberta government. Sych said they plan to ask for more provincial money.\n\nMatt Petrie retired from the RCMP in 2010 after more than two decades on the job.\n\nMatt Petrie was an RCMP officer for 22 years. In July 2005, co-worker Const. Jose Agostinho was killed when his cruiser was struck by a delivery truck. Just months earlier, four Alberta Mounties had been killed by gunman James Roszko in Mayerthorpe.\n\nPetrie said that's when it all came to a head for him. \"At time that, my life kind of just changed,\" he said. \"It kind of made me reflect on other things in the force that I dealt with but never really dealt with. You know, it was just there and you just suck it up and don't show any emotion. And that's the way the RCMP was, policing was.\"\n\nHe left the RCMP in 2010. Petrie said he spent a year seeing a psychologist and started the serious work of getting healthy. Once he was ready, he went back to school and obtained his masters degree in psychology.\n\n\"I think it is really important to understand that first responders, we're the helpers, and sometimes the helpers need help. You can't be doing your job effectively if your not healthy, mentally, physically, emotionally.\n\n\"Without a doubt, peer support needs to be there,\" he said. \"It needs to be in place in every single first-responder population.\n\nStudents Kristina Chin, left, and Brooke Sampert received scholarships to attend the symposium at River Cree Resort.\n\nThat message is being heard by students just starting their careers as paramedics.

We have seen a significant reduction of those numbers just over the past few weeks. In the past several months, we have seen as much as a 70-per-cent reduction over what we experienced last year. \" \u2014 Border Security Minister Bill Blair.\n\nThis was the response Border Security Minister Bill Blair provided on Oct. 25 to a question in the House of Commons posed by Conservative public safety critic Pierre Paul-Hus, who asked about the ongoing influx of irregular migrants crossing into Canada away from official entry points.\n\nAs part of his question, Paul-Hus said the \"number of illegal border crossings continues to rise.\"\n\nBlair rejected this as \"simply wrong,\" citing a \"significant reduction\" of 70 per cent in the last several months compared to last year.\n\nBut is either statement true?\n\nSpoiler alert: The Canadian Press Baloney Meter is a dispassionate examination of political statements culminating in a ranking of accuracy on a scale of \"no baloney\" to \"full of baloney\" (complete methodology below).\n\nThis one earns a rating of \"some baloney.\" Here's why.\n\nThe facts\n\nCanada began experiencing an influx of \"irregular\" border crossers in early 2017, shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would end a program that offered temporary status to immigrants from several countries to live in the United States.\n\nTens of thousands of asylum-seekers have since arrived in Canada from the U.S., avoiding official border checkpoints where they would have been turned away under the Safe Third Country agreement between the two countries. Instead, they've been crossing the border along forest paths and through fields, declaring their intent to seek refugee status once on Canadian soil.\n\nThe numbers\n\nBlair says the significant drop in asylum seekers happened \"in the past several months.\" Asylum claim statistics released by the Immigration Department show there was a reduction in the months of July to September this year compared to the same three months in 2017. But it was a drop of 53 per cent, not 70 per cent.\n\nBlair's press secretary Marie-Emmanuelle Cadieux clarified that Blair was comparing only the month of August 2018 with August of 2017 when citing the 70-per-cent reduction.\n\nIn that month alone, there were indeed 70 per cent fewer irregular migrants compared with the year before.\n\nHowever, year-over-year numbers show that overall, more people have crossed irregularly into Canada so far this year \u2014 15,726, compared to the 15,102 crossings from January to September 2017.\n\nThe experts\n\nMeasuring and predicting the number of irregular migrants who might come to Canada is hard, says Janet Dench of the Canadian Council for Refugees.\n\nShe pointed to the fact that many predicted a major surge this summer, as was experienced in 2017, as the warmer summer months make travel easier. Others predicted an influx of Salvadoran asylum seekers after the Trump administration moved to end temporary protected status for over 250,000 Salvadorans living in the United States.\n\n\"In the spring we heard people saying, 'There's going to be these huge numbers of people crossing over into Quebec,' and it actually remained pretty steady,\" Dench said.\n\n\"It's very difficult to predict, but I would say the numbers that are coming in Canada now is more reflective of the total number of refugees in the world.\"\n\nJamie Liew, an immigration lawyer and associate professor of law at the University of Ottawa, agreed it is hard to predict the number of irregular migrants who might cross the border. But once they do they show up, Canada has legal obligations to allow them to go through the process of claiming refugee status.\n\n\"I think the number is only useful in terms of how the government plans to shift resources to address the applications that are coming in or to address issues that are happening at the border.\"\n\nBoth Dench and Liew said too much focus has been put on the numbers of irregular migrants, which is just one aspect of issues involving Canada's refugee system. The politicians could be debating more important things, such as how we handle migrants' cases.\n\nThe verdict\n\nDuring the month of August, there was a 70-per-cent decrease in the number of irregular migrants crossing the border compared to the same month last year. However, given that there has been an overall increase in the number of asylum claims from irregular migrants so far this year compared to last year, Blair's statement that there has been a significant reduction contains \"some baloney.\"\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Baloney Meter is a project of The Canadian Press that examines the level of accuracy in statements made by politicians.\n\nEach claim is researched and assigned a rating based on the following scale:\n\nNo baloney \u2014 the statement is completely accurate\n\nA little baloney \u2014 the statement is mostly accurate but more information is required\n\nSome baloney \u2014 the statement is partly accurate but important details are missing\n\nA lot of baloney \u2014 the statement is mostly inaccurate but contains elements of truth\n\nFull of baloney \u2014 the statement is completely inaccurate", "Derrick Sturge says there was a \"strong suggestion\" that Nalcor Energy engage CIBC as the lender for the massive amount of borrowing needed to finance the Muskrat Falls project.\n\nHe was also asked about shifting large amounts of money around as construction of the controversial hydro project was ramping up, the top financial executive at the government-owned energy corporation said during the ongoing Muskrat Falls inquiry.\n\nSturge surprised the inquiry with that information during his second day as a witness on Thursday.\n\nThe information came at the end of his testimony, after his lawyer, David Buffett, asked this question:\n\n\"Was there ever a time you were asked to do something you didn't want to do or felt uncomfortable in doing?\"\n\n'It just didn't make sense'\n\nSturge recalled a conversation with an unnamed member of the Muskrat Falls project team about three years ago related to the Labrador Transmission Assets, the new power lines connecting the hydroelectric generating stations at Churchill Falls and Muskrat Falls.\n\nThat project is nearly complete, with a cost that has increased to more than $900 million.\n\nThe Labrador Transmission Assets includes two 250-kilometre, 315-kilovolt transmission lines between the hydroelectric generating facilities at Muskrat Falls and Churchill Falls. The lines are nearly complete, at a cost of roughly $900 million.

(Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\n\"And what was your reaction to that?\" Buffett asked Sturge.\n\n\"Absolutely no,\" Sturge said.\n\n\"We run a fair, competitive process, and [I] said no to it. And it died.

In return, he received shares in the company and rented out space for a cannabis grow-op.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau's legalization plan was supposed to cut out organized crime, but an investigation by Radio-Canada's Enqu\u00eate shows Health Canada has granted production licences to companies with individuals with links to the criminal underworld.\n\n\n\nEnqu\u00eate examined hundreds of documents as part of its investigation, including reviews conducted by Canadian securities oversight bodies. Enqu\u00eate is not naming the companies or individuals involved.\n\nFor its part, Health Canada says it has not seen any cases of organized crime infiltration of more than 130 licensed cannabis producers since 2013.\n\nTo produce cannabis, those who hold certain positions in companies must first obtain a permit from Health Canada by taking a security screening.\n\nAny past connections with individuals related to organized crime are part of the analyzed information.\n\nRed flags raised\n\nTo secure a licence, Health Canada first checks if the individual has a criminal record.\n\nSecond, the RCMP consults police databases to review information that may indicate an applicant's links to criminals.\n\nHealth Canada makes its final decision with the information provided by the RCMP.\n\nThe RCMP says it raised red flags on about 10 per cent of the applicants it was asked to check out in 2016 and 2017.\n\n\"It's really criminal associations,\" says Supt.

It's anonymous,\" she said, adding that it is \"one of the great vulnerabilities of the Canadian legal system.\"\n\n\"If we want to eliminate the Mafia cannabis market, we cannot allow them to use tax havens or trusts to enter indirectly through the back door,\" Carignan said.\n\nA report by the federal Department of Finance and several international organizations identifies trusts as one of the vehicles most at risk for money-laundering in Canada.\n\nIn a Senate appearance last April, Rizqy suggested refusing to grant production licences to companies financed through trusts.\n\n\"Maybe it would be wise to deny the licence outright because you are not able to unequivocally establish that the security clearance is really valid,\" said Rizqy.\n\nThe recommendation was not accepted. The federal cannabis legislation adopted this summer, however, did include more extensive background checks into individuals who back cannabis companies.\n\nToo many requirements for the cannabis industry?\n\nCarignan has faced criticism for his efforts to make cannabis companies more transparent.\n\nLine Beauchesne, a criminologist at the University of Ottawa, believes Health Canada's investigations are adequate and consistent with the government's desire to ensure the quality of the product and to prevent smuggling.\n\n\"Why especially for the cannabis industry?\" Beauchesne asked.\n\nIf there were to be new rules of transparency, \"all industries moving into Canada\" should be affected, she said.\n\nShe acknowledged, however, that Health Canada \"is absolutely not equipped to conduct financial investigations.\"\n\nIts traditional role is to ensure a product meets certain standards.\n\n\"Health Canada's job is to make sure that when I eat cheese, it's cheese. When it's eggs, it's eggs.

But it's hard for [the RCMP] and for Health Canada to go out and check in those countries,\" he said.\n\n\"Often, it's going to be the janitor who will sign the company documents or a law firm in country X.

They first met to discuss opening a food bank in late January.\n\n\"A group of us just kind of got together and started throwing out ideas,\" she said.\n\nHowever, once they connected with the Community Food Sharing Association, based in St. John's, it became clear how many factors would have to be put into place to get a food bank operational: an appropriate space, food storage, food shipment and insurance were just a few of the considerations.\n\n\"I think that we were all a little shook once we got off the phone with the Community Food Sharing Association because we just didn't really realize how much really went into an actual food bank,\" she said.\n\n\"It was a real eye-opener.\"\n\nHoping to open soon\n\nHowever, the group was not discouraged and continued to work on making the food bank a reality. It's something the community needs, Jararuse said, to fill a gap not addressed by other local food security programs.\n\nThe group has now put a board of directors in place for the food bank and is working on getting the appropriate insurance, she said.

Six pallets are coming from the Community Food Sharing Association, she said, and another is coming from a Thanksgiving weekend food drive.\n\nIt's too early to know what the need will really be, Jararuse said. The current plan is to distribute monthly and then assess requirements.\n\nThere are concerns about food costs in the winter, when only air shipments can come into Nain, she said, and the group is still fundraising and looking for potential support from individuals, businesses and other organizations.\n\nIf the pallets arrive as expected, the Nain food bank should open during the fall.\n\nWith files from Labrador Morning\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "With the launch of its 35th annual campaign, the first since the legalization of cannabis, the founder of Op\u00e9ration Nez Rouge said the organization is ready to take on the new challenge.\n\n\"At Nez Rouge, we've always said, 'If you feel you're not able to drive, don't take any chances \u2014 call us \u2014 and we won't ask any questions,'\" said Jean-Marie De Koninck.\n\nThe service is now offered in 102 communities across Canada, including 63 in Quebec, relying on 50,000 volunteers who drive people \u2014 and their cars \u2014 safely back home after office parties and social outings.\n\nThis year, the service will be available from Nov. 30 to Dec. 31.\n\nDe Koninck said it's always been an unwritten rule to provide service to people who shouldn't be driving because their judgment's affected by medication or drugs.\n\n\"Volunteers could tell you that people have called Nez Rouge in the past, not because they had consumed alcohol, but because they had smoked pot,\" he said.\n\nNow that cannabis is legal, De Koninck said he can't predict what will happen on Quebec's roads.

The earliest-known bird, Archaeopteryx, lived about 150 million years ago in Germany.\n\nEumaniraptorans, part of the larger theropod assemblage of two-legged meat-eating dinosaurs, generally were small and bird-like, covered in colourful plumage. They included predators up to 30 feet (nine meters) long and as small as a house cat, but did not include behemoths like Tyrannosaurus rex and Giganotosaurus.\n\nColours for camouflage\n\nEgg colour provided an evolutionary advantage to dinosaurs that had exposed nests for their eggs, rather than burying them as alligators and turtles do, in part by providing camouflage to protect against egg-eating predators, the researchers said.\n\nAll the other dinosaurs studied produced plain white eggs, indicating a single evolutionary origin of egg colour in eumaniraptoran dinosaurs that was passed on to their bird descendants.\n\nAn illustration shows a deinonychus chick hatching from a blue egg with brown spots.

(CBC)\n\nA motion to cancel the bid process came up just two votes shy on Wednesday after Moran and Calgary 2026 board chair Scott Hutcheson were grilled by councillors all day about a funding formula agreed to by Ottawa and the province.\n\nThe proposal calls for a revised total of $2.875 billion of required public funds, down from $3 billion.\n\nCalgarians will get to vote on whether the city should continue to pursue the bid in a plebiscite on Nov. 13.\n\nTombe argued at the forum that Olympics are megaprojects unlike others, with benefits that are sometimes hard to measure empirically.\n\nIntangible benefits\n\n\"And that's fine. I think a lot of the benefits, in terms of the economic aspects of the Games, are intangible. And we should be comfortable with that lack of precision, with our inability to really hang our hat on a specific number,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said it's important to include in the debate a discussion about which public spending priorities would be pushed lower in order to stage the Games.\n\n\"The public dollars being put into the Games are being reallocated from other uses,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, it is absolutely OK to rank spending on the Games above other priorities, that's a really productive debate to have. But we have to recognize that we are making a choice about reallocating dollars from one activity to another.\"\n\nO'Reilly reiterated Tombe's point about the importance of the intangibles.\n\nHe said Calgary will need to think beyond strictly the quantifiable economics of hosting the Games and find ways to weigh the possible benefits of such things as improving Calgary's ranking around the world.\n\n\"You can quantify it, but not economically. You don't put volunteer development, or sport development, or community development, or city branding, in terms of dollars from that investment. You measure it in other ways,\" he said.\n\n\"If you go purely economics, it's a tough, tough decision. If you start to value those other things vis-a-vis other levels of risk and investment, be them health care, roads, etc., then you, as the citizens of Calgary \u2026 have to make that vote and decide on it, whether it makes sense for you.\"\n\nChamber of Commerce on board\n\nThe Calgary Chamber of Commerce threw its support behind the bid on Thursday, saying it has the potential to \"anchor positive momentum for Calgary's business community.\"\n\nThe chamber's CEO, Sandip Lalli, said in a release the organization supports a bid based on the funding framework revealed on Wednesday and called on bid officials to bring the business community on board with a \"commerce-centric\" plan.\n\n\"If we can keep the bid financially modest and the vision bold, then the international platform the Games offers can grow commerce, bolster deal flow, enhance the reputation of Canada's industries, and stimulate investment,\" said Lalli.\n\n\"We commend the bid committee and all levels of government for getting a disciplined deal done. It's time now to give the business community a further voice to drive the Calgary can-do vision forward.\"\n\nCalgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi says the Olympic funding formula agreed to by Ottawa and the province is a good deal for Calgary. (City of Calgary)\n\nSpeaking to theCalgary Eyeopener on Thursday, Mayor Naheed Nenshi says that while he didn't enjoy the \"weird process\" that resulted in Wednesday's release of the framework for a funding deal, he is now convinced it's a winning formula.\n\n\"When you look at this deal, it's a really good deal,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm going to vote yes, and I hope people will as well.\"\n\nNenshi says that at the end of the day, Calgary is being called on to ante up just under $400 million \u2014 $300 million of which goes toward a fieldhouse that has been high on the city's priorities list for a long time.\n\nAnother $40 million or $50 million will pay for much-needed upgrades to facilities such as WinSport and McMahon Stadium, Nenshi said.\n\n\"In return for that $400 million we get $4.2 billion. That's a 10-to-1 return. And to me, that really makes a ton of sense for Calgary, setting aside all the benefits we will get from all these infrastructure improvements.\"\n\nNenshi also countered a contention by a Montreal sports economist who says the true cost of staging the Games in Calgary could reach $8 billion.\n\n'Made-up number'\n\nMoshe Lander says there is usually a 50 per cent cost overrun on Olympic Games.\n\n\"That's clearly a made-up number. It has no basis in fact,\" Nenshi said.\n\n\"We're not doing Sochi. We're not doing Pyeongchang . We're not doing the summer Olympics, which are 10 times larger, which he uses to calculate those numbers. We're not even doing Vancouver.\"\n\nNenshi says big cost overruns arise largely because of capital investment, which in Calgary will be deliberately modest.\n\n\"We're not building a lot of stuff here. And that's very much on purpose. This is a lean Olympics,\" he said.\n\n\"But the other thing is, in the budget, there is already $1 billion in the budget to cover for any contingencies or unexpected overruns, and that's already funded.\"", "Winnipeg police are asking for help finding a 17-year-old girl who hasn't been since since September.\n\nMadison Morrisseau was last reported seen in the city's downtown during the afternoon of Sept. 24.\n\nShe is described as having a thin build, weighing about 150 pounds, and 5 feet, seven inches in height.

I just think I would like USADA or somebody in the United States ... to go and speak to the players' unions and suggest to them that the whole development of clean sport would set a very good example if that could be done in the United States.\"\n\nReedie said he has tried to persuade NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to get football subject to the WADA code.\n\nRehabilitation instead of sanctioning\n\n\"The league is actually answerable to the owners,\" Reedie said of the teams. \"There is a general belief in the United States that instead of sanctioning maybe you should try the rehabilitation you know as a principle.

But he couldn't hold them back when he saw the distinctive stars stitched on goalie Braden Holtby's chest protector, peeking through the team's white away jersey.\n\nThat chest protector was a Kenesky \u2014 and just like that, a Hamilton icon that is intrinsically tied to history of the NHL and hockey in Canada returned to the world's biggest stage.\n\n\"I was in awe. I couldn't believe it,\" said Hulsman, the current co-owner of the Kenesky brand.\n\n\"We were back.\"\n\nHoltby is just one of a host of NHL stars like Pekka Rinne, Mike Smith, Craig Anderson and Roberto Luongo who are all now wearing Kenesky chest protectors.\n\n'When we stopped making equipment back in 92, it kind of broke my heart. But now we have a whole new enthusiasm.\" - Joel Hulsman\n\nHulsman, alongside co-owner and designer Mike Howard and designer Dave Wilcox, have resurrected the historic brand and are outfitting the league's titans, capitalizing on an NHL rule change that had many goalies scrambling to find new gear that worked.\n\nAnd it's all happening out of a small, London, Ont.-based shop \u2014 a business forged out of a longtime friendship between people who have lived and breathed hockey their whole lives.\n\n\"I just wanted to carry on the legacy,\" Hulsman said.\n\nA century-long history\n\nThe original Kenesky's store stood at the corner of Barton Street and Wellington Street for just over 100 years before it was demolished back in 2016.\n\nFor years, Kenesky's shaped every level of hockey in Canada all the way up to the NHL. In the late 60s and early 70s, every single goalie pad worn in the NHL was made by the store's then-owner, Emil \"Pops\" Kenesky.\n\nThe shop first opened in 1915, two years before the NHL was born \u2014 but it wasn't until 1924 that Pops reinvented the hockey pad. His pads were wider, and controlled rebounds better. For the next 50 years, they were the go-to pads for goalies, made in secrecy in the second floor of the shop. No one except a Kenesky could go upstairs where he worked.\n\nPops died in 1975, and his sons took over the family business, including the secret to making the pads. But when newer materials surfaced, Kenesky's couldn't keep up. The company's last pads were made unceremoniously in 1992, and after that, the store became almost solely a retail outlet for hockey gear. Shortly after Pop's son Jack died in 2005, Hulsman, who was already a co-owner with Pete Richards, bought the last of the family's shares of the store.\n\nThe shop remained a Hamilton fixture for the sale of hockey equipment until it closed at the end of 2015 \u2014 but it had been a long time since an NHLer had worn Kenesky pads, by then.\n\nJoel Hulsman started working at Kenesky's Hamilton store as a teen back in 1968. Now, he's a co-owner of the brand. (Jeff Green/CBC)\n\nIt wasn't long after the store closed that Howard, a longtime friend, reached out to Hulsman. He was also a lifer in the industry, having designed gear for brands like Vaughn and Eagle for the last 35 years.\n\nHe knew he wanted to partner with Hulsman because of the weight of the Kenesky name.\n\n\"Joel said he wanted to partner up with someone who was innovative, and had the same essence that Pops did from back in his day, because he was innovative as well,\" Howard said.\n\nThe pair linked up at the right time, as the opportunity to fill a niche quickly came calling.\n\nSeizing a golden opportunity\n\nThis season, all NHL netminders are sporting a smaller chest protector as the league continues the process of shrinking equipment, following recent size reductions for goalie pads and pants.\n\nThe aim, like the other streamlined goalie gear, was to boost scoring while at the same time rewarding athletic ability in the crease by eliminating unnecessary padding that wasn't protecting goalies, but instead simply helping them block pucks.\n\nIn short, a 190-pound goalie and a 240-pound goalie would no longer look the same on the ice.\n\nMany goalies, Howard says, found the companies that were previously making their chest protectors simply shrank their pre-existing designs, and that didn't work. They were stiff, or left areas open to feel the brunt of an impact \u2014 which is a bad thing when throwing yourself in front of a 120 km/h Zdeno Chara slapshot.\n\nKenesky's, however, built a design specifically suited to the new regulations. Seeing as Howard has outfitted over 1,500 goalies in his decades of work, he was well suited to the task.\n\n\"We figured we would use the chest protector to get our foot in the door \u2026 because we knew every goalie this season was going to have to switch with the new rules that were coming out,\" he said.\n\nPops Kenesky, a former harness maker, made the name famous among goalies for his handmade leather and deer hair pads. Between 1969 and 1971, every NHL goalie wore Kenesky pads. (Jeff Green/CBC)\n\nNow, with so many goaltenders trying out their chest protectors, the pair is hoping goalies will start to adopt some of the company's other offerings, like their pads, gloves and blockers.\n\n\"It just keeps the old man's legacy going \u2026 that's always been so important to me,\" Hulsman said. \"When we stopped making equipment back in 92, it kind of broke my heart.\n\n\"But now we have a whole new enthusiasm.\"\n\nadam.carter@cbc.ca", "The United States imposed new sanctions Thursday on Venezuela and Cuba and promised additional penalties against Nicaragua as the Trump administration laid out a hard-line policy toward countries the White House branded a \"troika of tyranny.\"\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton condemned what he called the \"destructive forces of oppression, socialism and totalitarianism\" that he said the three countries represent.\n\nIn a speech in Miami, home to thousands of exiles from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, Bolton said the U.S. \"will no longer appease dictators and despots near our shores in this hemisphere.\" He spoke at the Freedom Tower, an important local landmark to the Cuban community in South Florida.\n\nThe administration will prohibit U.S. citizens from involvement in the gold export trade from Venezuela.

Watch it here.\n\nBuilding a 'human wall'\n\nTwo years after his election victory, Donald Trump's promised wall along the border with Mexico remains unfunded and unbuilt.\n\nBut if he can't have a bricks-and-mortar barrier, the U.S. president seems intent on erecting one of flesh and blood.\n\n\"We have to have a wall of people,\" Trump told ABC News in an interview last night, talking about the ever-inflating number of troops he intends to deploy across the southern border states.\n\nLast week, when Trump began sharing scare stories about the caravan of Central American migrants making its way north through Mexico and promised to \"seal off the border,\" Pentagon officials were talking about sending 800 to 1,000 troops. By Monday, the figure had grown to 5,200 soldiers.\n\nNow, five days ahead of the midterm elections, the president has vowed to dispatch as many as 15,000.\n\nMigrants travelling with a caravan of thousands from Central America en route to the United States wait in a queue to board a bus to transport them to Juchitan from Santiago Niltipec, Mexico, on Tuesday. (Hannah McKay/Reuters)\n\nIt's not clear if Trump is including the 2,100 National Guard troops he ordered to the border in April. But either way, Operation Faithful Patriot, as it has been dubbed, sounds like a big deal; equal to the number of soldiers the U.S. has in Afghanistan, and far more than it has devoted to fighting ISIS in Syria and Iraq.\n\nWhat they'll be doing is a bit of a mystery, however.\n\nThe caravan is still about 1,500 kilometres away from the U.S. border. And under American law, the soldiers aren't allowed to arrest or even detain anyone they see trying to sneak across the frontier.\n\nYesterday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis characterized the mission as \"practical support\" for U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents, likening it to what the military does in the wake of a natural disaster.\n\nStars and Stripes, the U.S. military newspaper, reports that 39 units comprising 7,000 active duty service-members have so far been notified that they may soon be spread out across the southwest. They include transport helicopter units, engineering teams, military police and public affairs personnel. There are no ground combat troops.\n\nAnd the National Guardsmen who have been in place since the spring are mostly keeping busy with vehicle maintenance and administrative work.\n\nThe troops will be allowed to harden physical barriers along the 2,100-kilometre border, so the Pentagon is preparing to send barbed and concertina wire, temporary fencing and light towers.\n\nMembers of the U.S. military's Task Force Griffin get ready to board a Super Hercules at Fort Knox, Ken., on Tuesday in support of Operation Faithful Patriot.

Wockenfuss/Associated Press)\n\nHow much this will cost has yet to be revealed.\n\nThe bill for the first six months of the National Guard deployment came to $185 million US, or roughly $1 million a day. By that measure, 15,000 more troops would cost about $225 million a month.\n\nWhen then President George W. Bush sent the National Guard to fortify the border from June 2006 to July 2008 \u2014 6,000 troops for the first year, reduced to 3,000 for the second \u2014 it ended up costing $1.2 billion.\n\nOver the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 396,579 people \"between ports of entry\" along the southwest frontier. That's about 93,000 more than the year before, but there's not much evidence that the logistical support of the National Guard helped. There were as many people arrested in March \u2014 before the deployment \u2014 as in August. And the yearly totals remain hundreds of thousands below the peak migration years of the early 2000s.\n\nTrump's advisors have surely told him this. But the president long ago determined that he was going to make illegal immigration the centrepiece of the Republicans' midterm campaign.\n\nAnd this morning, the president showed that he intends to turn up the temperature yet again, with a new campaign ad featuring a twice-deported Mexican immigrant who has been sentenced to death for killing two California cops.\n\nThe web spot seeks to make Luis Bracamontes the new Willie Horton.\n\n\"Illegal immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, killed our people!,\" reads the text. \"Democrats let him into our country \u2026 Democrats let him stay.\"\n\n(Warning, graphic content:)\n\nIt is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country.

Washed out by record flooding in May 2017, it's the only land link connecting Churchill and the Arctic communities that rely on it to the rest of Canada.\n\nHeard a familiar (unfamiliar?) sound of a whistle... booked it to the station, and there it was!

But the real human story here is what the rail link means to the quality of life of the people who live here. The flight from Winnipeg to Churchill is only a couple of hours, but costs about as much as a flight to Europe. That's impractical for people who need to head out of town to see a specialist, get groceries at the nearest Wal-Mart, or even send kids to a neighbouring community for a field trip or to play in a hockey tournament. On my last trip to the region, resident Steve Palmer told me, \"For us, the train coming back \u2014 it's not so we can leave, it's so we can stay.\" For almost a century the railway has made Churchill an example and cautionary tale of how an economy can be quickly built or hobbled in Canada's rugged North. A crew repairs the Hudson Bay Railway after it was badly damaged by May 207 flooding. (Arctic Gateway) In the 1920s, frustrated farmers in Western Canada felt taken advantage of by railways and the big eastern ports in Thunder Bay and Montreal. Attention turned to the North and its shorter shipping routes to Europe. A railway was punched through some of Manitoba's most rugged terrain and a port built on the shore Hudson Bay. Over the nine decades since then, Churchill rose and fell with the fortunes of its rail line as political whims, indifferent ownership and commodities markets all conspired at times against the interests of the community. Now that early 20th century idea of a Hudson Bay port is being repackaged for the 21st century. As the Arctic warms, there are bets that northern shipping will become increasingly strategic and profitable. Churchill, Man., resident Steve Palmer, seen here at home with his wife Dawne, says the rail link is essential to the future of his community. (Cameron MacIntosh/CBC) A coalition of rail-line communities, First Nations, agricultural traders and one of Canada's biggest investment firms have taken control of the rail line and port, with $117 million in support from the federal government. Once again Manitoba's north is being envisioned as a staging point for Arctic development and a busy international port, moving commodities like grains and fertilizers. And its new operators say it could even be a solution to western Canada's modern day commodities problem: A tide-water port for shipping oil. But the immediate winners are the residents, who once again have the land link to the rest of Canada that's crucial to their daily lives. Their long, worried wait for the train is over.

In 2008, I was covering the NDP during the federal election.\n\nFor many many days, the central question at the beginning of that campaign was whether Elizabeth May should be allowed to participate.\n\nNot key policy questions. Not economic issues. Not anything with any kind of substance. Just debate talk.\n\nBoth Stephen Harper and Jack Layton agreed May should not be allowed to debate, in essence because she had so loudly supported then-Liberal leader Stephane Dion's \"green shift.\"\n\nThe broadcast consortium (including the CBC) decided it would rather not lose two leaders for the price of one, so it also chose to keep May out.\n\nFortunately for me, I was able to go back and read some of my blog entries (yes, we had a political blog at the time \u2014 I also rolled my eyes), and for days it's all I wrote about.\n\nBut then the pressure started to build on the other leaders. Layton finally recognized it had become a distraction from the actual election, and conceded May could participate.\n\nSo she did.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May, second from right, gives a thumb's up as she stands between Conservative Leader Stephen Harper and Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe prior to the start of the English language federal election debate in Ottawa on Oct. 2, 2008.

There is no minimum weight that is considered \"fat\" by this definition.\n\nVirgie Tovar is an author, activist and an expert on fat discrimination and body image. (Donna Scarola)\n\nTovar recalls one encounter she had at a corporate office in San Francisco. After hitting it off with the female interviewer in the first and second interviews, Tovar felt she was a frontrunner for the position.\n\n\"However, her boss had to approve me,\" said Tovar. \"So I go all the way upstairs and I'm greeted at the elevator by a man and he kind of looks me up and down and is visibly disappointed.\"\n\nShe says this situation played out several times in her search for a new job. Each time, she would make it through the initial phase. But when bosses saw her, she says they were reluctant to hire her.\n\nTovar now spends her time writing about fatphobia in the workplace. She's a freelance contributor at Forbes magazine and the author of the book You Have the Right to Remain Fat.\n\nWorkplaces set up to support smaller body types, says expert\n\nAngela Alberga is an assistant professor at Concordia University in Montreal. Her research focuses on better understanding how certain societal or institutional factors influence weight-related issues and weight stigma. She says fatphobia doesn't just affect job growth, it creeps into every aspect of a person's life.\n\n\"If people actually experience these types of negative judgments associated with their body size they may feel more anxious \u2026 and blame themselves,\" said Alberga. \"And that shame and guilt can actually really affect their psychological well-being.\"\n\nShe says there are several common and harmful stigmas associated with fatphobia and that, once established, they can be difficult to reverse.\n\nAngela Alberga is an assistant professor of health, kinesiology and applied physiology at Concordia University in Montreal. (Submitted by Angela Alberga)\n\nAccording to Alberga, some of the stereotypes that people in a larger body face include people thinking that they're undisciplined, inactive, not as friendly, more emotional and less likely to succeed.\n\nEven when hired, the workplace can still feel hostile because Alberga says workplaces are set up to support smaller body types.\n\nAn example of this is an office fitness challenge, which Tovar says is \"absolutely inappropriate.\"\n\n\"They have no place in the workplace,\" said Tovar. \"There's absolutely no reason that your employer should be surveilling you on what you eat or how much you weigh.\"\n\nBosses need to educate themselves\n\nIn a U.S. study published in Science Direct called \"The affective and interpersonal consequences of obesity,\" researchers found 45 per cent of employers were less inclined to recruit a candidate they considered obese.\n\nThey also found obese people are less likely to be regarded as able leaders and had lower starting salaries.\n\nTovar says everyone has to raise their voice on this stigma, especially those who happen to be smaller.\n\n\"Like, I have this advantage. People think of me in a certain way because I'm in a smaller body. And how can I leverage that in order to kind of create a better more inclusive, less phobic workplace?\" said Tobar.\n\nShe encourages those in power to read more about, what she calls, fat justice and activism and to seek out fat-positive literature.\n\nShe also wants companies to have diverse body types featured in internal marketing.\n\nBoth women say attitudes about larger bodied people are changing, but not fast enough.\n\nIn the interim, they say many companies may be missing out on talented workers because they were too preoccupied with the candidates clothing size instead of the wealth of experience they could bring to the job.", "Residents of Churchill have taken to the streets to celebrate after the federal government announced full passenger and freight rail service should be restored to the northern Manitoba community by the end of the month.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau made the announcement at the Port of Churchill this morning, as hundreds of residents gathered for a street party to celebrate the arrival last night of the first train into Churchill in 18 months.\n\n\"Churchill, as Canada's only Arctic deep water port, is something I'm very optimistic about,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"Supporting the North is of fundamental importance to the future of Canada.\"\n\nThe announcement is part of a $117-million commitment the federal government is making to resurrect both the rail line and Canada's only deep water Arctic port.\n\nFor the last 20 years, the port has struggled in the face short shipping seasons, changing agricultural markets and indifferent ownership.\n\nMany here say the deal is critical to save the northern community and others in the Arctic that rely on it.\n\n\"It's a really good day, when we heard the train whistles going, it felt just like the good old days,\" said millwright Kim Kushniryk, who works on and off at the port.\n\nHundreds of residents gathered for a street party to celebrate the arrival last night of the first train into Churchill in 18 months. 1:58\n\nShe's looking forward to finally having steady work when next year's shipping season starts.

The shooting was followed by the \"Wake Up\" rally, which protested gun violence.\n\nBut Professor Gira Bhatt, a member of the coalition's executive committee, says efforts to curb the violence have so far only focused on \"at-risk\" youth, rather than all youth in general.\n\nHow to define 'at risk'\n\n\"We believe that efforts should also extend to those kids who are not at risk yet, and that part has not been looked into,\" said Bhatt, who teaches psychology at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.\n\nBhatt said she'd like to see the new councils allocate resources to community programs that bring young people together from all walks of life. She said it can be difficult to define \"at risk\" behaviour, so it's important for these programs to appeal to everyone.\n\nThrough her work, Bhatt said she has learned poverty and familial disfunction aren't necessarily factors that lure youth into the gang lifestyle. She said many youth who find the criminal lifestyle appealing come from well-to-do backgrounds.\n\n\"Families are often totally shocked that their kids were involved in such activities,\" said Bhatt.\n\n\"Just because the kids are doing well in school or they are star athletes, doesn't mean they are beyond the lures of gang lifestyle.\"\n\nBhatt added that there has also been a recent shift to younger recruitment. When she began her career, the fear was teenagers being recruited into gangs. Now, gangs are targeting children as young as 11, she said.\n\nBhatt said she would like to see city councils meet with community groups to learn the specific needs of local youth outreach programs. She then stressed the importance of new governments collaborating with those community groups to develop inclusive crime prevention strategies.\n\n\"The governments need to listen.

As a southern Inuk? In the future, where do you want your community to be, where do you want us as a group to be?\" Russell told CBC's Labrador Morning.\n\n\"People were so engaged in that and it just told me that our people are in a place, too, where they see that the process we're involved in with the federal government, and some time in the future the provincial government, is something that is meaningful and significant to them \u2014 and for the generations to come.\"\n\nTodd Russell shows off the new official NunatuKavut flag at the annual general assembly on the weekend. (NunatuKavut/Facebook)\n\nThose talks with governments Russell referred to are to recognize Indigenous Rights and Self Determination for NunatuKavut.\n\n\"Obviously people want to be self-governing again, have more control over their own lives, where we're going to go as a people, more control over their own resources,\" Russell said.\n\n\"This was heard loud and clear when it came to things like the fishery and other resources, particularly when people hear talks of mines.\"\n\nAs part of the AGA, Russell said the official new NunatuKavut flag, which showcases cornerstones of Labrador Inuit culture, was unveiled.\n\n\"It's a beautiful vibrant flag and it has those beautiful colours that resemble the sky, the water, the snow, ice, the land itself, so it has these beautiful, beautiful white, green, blue beautiful, vibrant colours,\" Russell said.\n\nThe image in the centre features an ulu, a traditional Inuit knife used by women.\n\n\"It represents the tremendous role that our grandmothers, our aunts, that the women and the girls in Inuit culture played in our communities, in our history \u2014 and they still do,\" said Russell.\n\nNunatuKavut members discuss the issues facing their communities at the annual general assembly.

She has pleaded not guilty to failing to provide the necessaries of life to her mother, who was under her charge.\n\nBrandon police Const. Jeffrey Hoad conducted the interview, which lasted more than an hour. It was part of the investigation into Collins' care, which started before she died.\n\nAt first, Deutscher told Hoad she was scared and couldn't believe what was happening. She was given the opportunity to call a lawyer before he started asking questions about Collins' care under her charge.\n\n\"My entire life, like, I have been with my mom at Christmas every year of my life \u2026 I have been extremely close with my mom,\" Deutscher told Hoad. \"You have no idea \u2026 If I hadn't moved her to Brandon \u2026 she would have died.\"\n\nDeutscher, who broke down in tears a number of times during the interview, talked about how dedicated she was to her mother and that she only wanted to help her mom when she moved her to Brandon from Saskatoon in 2013.\n\nI talked to a holistic doctor and a homeopathic doctor and she told me what to do. - Rae Deutscher\n\nShe also talked about spending hours with her every day, taking time off work, to feed her and prepare meals and boasted about her all-natural lifestyle.\n\n\"I knew my mom would not survive in a home because she needed me to help her to eat,\" she told Hoad. \"I had her on all-natural and all the natural made her be able to eat.\"\n\nDeutscher also talked about how she took her mom for reiki, a Japanese healing technique that is said to relax and de-stress people, and gave her supplements and bubble baths with oil and lotion to help lessen the effects of dementia.\n\nShe also suggested her mom starved to death while in the hospital because she wouldn't eat the food, also suggesting there was a court case to be had against the Brandon Regional Health Centre.\n\nHoad had to bring the interview back on track several times after Deutscher would sidetrack into stories about her or her mother's life and travels. He had to ask repeatedly how her mom sustained the fractures, bruising and brain bleeds that eventually led to her hospitalization and why she wasn't taken to a doctor sooner.\n\n\"I talked to a holistic doctor and a homeopathic doctor and she told me what to do,\" Deutscher said. \"She was never in pain. She slept like a baby.\"\n\n\"I've got concerns about what your mother was going to though to the point that when \u2026 Brandon police showed up at your door,\" Hoad said. \"That wasn't the result of a phone call from you. That was other people with concerns about your mom's well-being that we showed up there.\"\n\nDeutscher said she was planning to take Collins to the emergency room.\n\n\"I wanted to strengthen my mom before I ever bought her to the place,\" she told Hoad. \"I was giving her iron before that.\"\n\n\"You knew she fell off the toilet,\" Hoad said, referring to one of the falls Collins supposedly took. \"You knew she fell and hit her shoulder.\"\n\n\"It's not like \u2026 I've got a really beautiful, cushiony rug,\" Deutscher replied.\n\nDoctors testify\n\nA doctor who treated Collins testified earlier on Thursday that she had multiple injuries and suspected she was being neglected by her daughter.\n\nDr. Barbara Kelleher cared for Collins at the Brandon Regional Health Centre for four days after she was admitted to the hospital in November 2014 and the three days before she died on Dec. 24, 2014.\n\nShe and Dr. Jacie Grobb, the emergency room physician who was the first to see Collins when she arrived at the Brandon hospital on Nov. 26, 2014, both testified that Collins' case stood out.\n\n\"She had fractures and head injuries and bruises and scrapes and marks,\" Kelleher said. \"She was also very emaciated. It wasn't right.\"\n\nBoth described large bruises over Collins' body, including one in particular over her right eye, as well as fractured ribs and bleeding around the brain.\n\nCollins went to the hospital after her granddaughter learned she had been living on the bathroom floor of Deutscher's home. Family called police and paramedics took Collins to the hospital.\n\nOn Wednesday, the trial heard from several family members. Chandra Hawkins, Deutscher's daughter, testified that she and other family members had become concerned on several occasions about the care Deutscher was providing to Collins and that the family twice contacted police.\n\nRae Deutscher has pleaded not guilty to failing to provide the necessaries of life to her mother, who was under her charge. 1:50\n\nThe family first contacted police in June 2014 with concerns about her care, but an assessment by a geriatric mental health team found no concerns.\n\nThe family called police again in November 2014, after Hawkins learned Collins' condition had worsened and she had been living in a duvet on the bathroom floor in Deutscher's home.\n\nShe died less than a month later in hospital.\n\nHawkins testified that her mom had refused to take Collins to a doctor after she moved her from Saskatoon to Brandon in 2013 and instead had her on a number of vitamins and supplements.\n\nNeglect suspected\n\nKelleher testified Thursday that she had reviewed Collins' medical chart and it showed just one doctor's visit, soon after she moved to Brandon, and no others until she arrived at the hospital.\n\nShe said concerns were raised about the age of some of the fractures and injuries and the lack of medical care.\n\n\"Her power of attorney was the person we felt had been neglecting her,\" Kelleher testified, adding that medical staff had tried to get her care signed over to a public trustee under the Vulnerable Persons Act. Deutscher held Collins' power of attorney at the time.\n\nKelleher said she met with Deutscher on Nov. 28, 2014, along with a social worker, to try to ascertain when and how the injuries occurred\n\n\"From what I could tell, she had tripped [on a rug], and that was approximately maybe two months or more ago was all I got,\" Kelleher said, based on what she was told by Deutscher. \"And then she had fallen backwards.\u2026 Her daughter described it as she was seeing if she could walk.\n\n\"She was very vague,\" Kelleher testified. \"I did get the gist that she left her while she went to work, sitting on the couch with a blanket, and she would be there until she got home.\"\n\nDeutscher never called for help or took her mother to the emergency room, Kelleher said.\n\n\"She never sought home care when she was not able to tend to her.\"\n\nKelleher also testified that Collins was given comfort care in the hospital, but was never well enough to leave.\n\nGrobb ordered bloodwork, a CT scan and X-rays for Collins, court heard. She also consulted a neurosurgeon, but it was decided that surgery would not be a good route, as Collins was old and frail and likely would not survive due to her condition.\n\nOn cross-examination, defence lawyer Andrew Synyshyn reiterated to Grobb and the court several times that Collins was 96 and some of her medical issues could have arisen due to her advanced age.\n\nGrobb and Kelleher testified that tests of Collins' heart and respiratory systems were normal, as was her blood work. Her pupils were also reactive, she testified when asked by Synyshyn.\n\nThe Crown closed its case against Deutscher on Thursday.\n\nThe trial is expected to wrap up on Friday.", "A Russian space investigation has found a sensor that was damaged during assembly forced a Russian rocket to abort its trip two minutes after it was launched, a top Russian official said Thursday.\n\nThe Soyuz-FG rocket carrying NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin failed shortly into the Oct. 11 flight, sending their capsule into a sharp fall back to Earth.

The deadly attack took place outside a Toronto restaurant on Dec. 30, 2015.\n\nOntario Superior Court Justice Maureen Forestell \u200bhas ruled that the trial cannot continue partly because the Crown, while cross-examining Cummins, played 11 pieces of security video for the jury that it had not entered into evidence when the case was first laid out.\n\nLast week, all three of the accused applied for a mistrial on the grounds that \"their fair trial rights had been irremediably prejudiced by the conduct of the Crown in putting before the jury inadmissible evidence during the cross-examination of the accused,\" Forestell wrote in her 20-page decision.\n\nThe judge wrote that even if the Crown had asked permission to play the videos, she would have ruled seven of them inadmissible.\n\n\"I find that the use of this evidence in cross-examination for substantive purposes ... was fundamentally unfair to the three accused,\" she wrote in her decision.\n\n\"I have concluded that no other remedy [but a mistrial] would redress the harm.\"\n\nDuring the trial, Cummins testified that he had punched and kicked Noureddine outside St Louis Bar and Grill on Yonge Street, in midtown Toronto, on Dec. 30, 2015, causing his death.\n\nCummins had pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder but guilty to manslaughter, a plea the Crown did not accept.\n\nThe Crown played the 11 videos during his cross-examination ostensibly to discredit Cummins's version of events, but Forestell determined that only four of the clips served that purpose.\n\n\"Had the Crown played only those four videos for the clear purpose of impeachment, I would not have been of the view that a mistrial was required because of the failure to seek leave to show the evidence to the jury.\"\n\nCummins, Moreira and Smith will remain behind bars.\n\nVictims parents devastated as new trial ordered\n\nMagda Khatib, Noureddine's mother, said she's now in a \"miserable\" situation.\n\n\"I can't handle to see them anymore,\" she said of the three accused.\n\n\"It's devastating to go through this again,\" said Hassan Noureddine, the victim's father, after hearing another trial would be necessary.\n\n\"It's very emotional.\"\n\nThe case will be back in court next Tuesday, when a jury for a new trial could be chosen", "A deadly crash on a busy toll highway north of Toronto may have been caused by a mechanical failure in one of the vehicles involved, Ontario Provincial Police said Thursday.\n\nSgt.

Max Waddell, with the Winnipeg Police Service's organized crime division, said the meth alone could translate into about 30,000 hits.\n\nThe bust could possibly disrupt the supply in the city.\n\n\"Any time you can get any methamphetamine off the streets of Winnipeg, it's a positive move towards that,\" he said.\n\n\"Most certainly, the individuals involved in this drug network were significant players, and \u2026 taking these drugs away from them and dismantling their network is going to have a significant impact in the city of Winnipeg.\"\n\nAmong the property and weapons taken in Manitoba, police seized $121,000 in cash, a Walther \u200bP99 9-mm semi-automatic handgun and ammunition, and $404,500 worth of vehicles.

It was great the kids got to see him as not just a player on TV, they got to see him as an actual person.\"\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that Davies was roaming the same halls as many of the kids at the school.\n\nHe attended the soccer academy at St. Nicholas for two years, leaving when he turned 14.\n\nDavies signed to his first professional contract in 2015 with the Vancouver Whitecaps FC. By 2016 he was playing on the professional team and scoring goals.\n\nBossio, his former coach, said he knew Davies was special when he first laid eyes on him.\n\n'Destined for greatness'\n\n\"I knew that this boy was destined for greatness,\" Bossio said.\n\n\"I did an interview with him in Grade 7, I basically asked him, what were his goals, what were his ambitions. And sure enough, he answered, 'My goal is to be a professional soccer player and to play in the pros.'\n\n\"And at the age of 11, to be able to realize that says a lot. This kid was very special.\"\n\nAnd the soccer world realized that quickly, too. During the 2016 season with Vancouver, Davies played in eight MLS games, four Canadian Championship games, and three games in the CONCACAF Champions League.\n\nHis international exposure garnered interest from European clubs including Manchester United, Chelsea, and Liverpool.\n\n'An emotional night'\n\nEventually on July 25 of this year, the Whitecaps club announced it had signed a multi-million dollar transfer of Davies to FC Bayern Munich in Germany's Bundesliga.\n\nLast weekend, in front of family and friends, Davies played his farewell game for Vancouver.

That's a big one,\" she said. \"Chocolate is toxic for dogs and, to a certain extent, cats, but it's not as common in cats.\"\n\nThe culprit is theobromine, a toxic compound naturally found in cacao beans. What causes a feeling of euphoria in humans can lead to vomiting, diarrhea and death in dogs.\n\nVeterinarians see a big spike in chocolate-related toxicity cases immediately after Halloween. (Getty Images)\n\nIt takes great amounts for an average-size human to be affected because we can easily metabolize it, but small doses are poisonous to dogs.\n\nTheir digestive systems process theobromine much more slowly, allowing toxic levels to build up in the heart, central nervous system and kidneys.\n\n\"Chocolate toxicity is very common, and we are expecting a large number [of cases] today,\" said Hawkes. \"Over the years that's usually how it goes.\"\n\nThe danger depends on the amount of chocolate, the size of the dog and the type of chocolate consumed. The darker the chocolate, the higher the concentration of theobromine.\n\nA small amount will likely cause an upset stomach with vomiting or some diarrhea, while a little more can lead to cardiovascular problems like rapid breathing and increased heart rate as well as muscle tension and lack of co-ordination.\n\nToo much can cause seizures and death.\n\nSometimes people call in a panic, saying their pooch just swallowed a single chocolate chip, Hawkes said.\n\n\"That's probably not going to hurt the dog but it's good that they're checking,\" she said, adding a phone call first is a good idea because it could save you a trip and some money.\n\nKeep an eye on the animal just in case. Symptoms usually occur between four and 24 hours after a dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nDressing up your dog can be fun, but sharing your treats with it is definitely not a good idea. (Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\n\nChocolate isn't the only risk, though. Candies, especially those labelled as sugar-free, are another concern.\n\n\"They often have a Xylitol sweetener in them and that can cause liver damage and can cause a dangerously low drop in blood sugar,\" said Hawkes.\n\nRaisins, too, are a big no-no, although the miniature boxes of those seem to have dropped off in popularity as treats.\n\n\"Raisins and grapes are very toxic to dogs,\" Hawkes said. \"It's scary because most households do have grapes or raisins and many households do have dogs.\"\n\nAnd then there's simply the packaging of the products themselves. Dogs aren't likely to unwrap a chocolate bar, so the wrappers will be devoured as well, or they might inadvertently swallow packaging while trying to lick it clean.\n\n\"Packaging in the stomach or intestines can cause an obstruction and in rare cases, they might need surgery to have it removed,\" said Hawkes.", "The federal government has awarded contracts worth $7 billion to three shipyards for maintenance and repair work on Royal Canadian Navy frigates.\n\nPublic Services and Procurement Canada today announced the advanced contract award notices to Seaspan Victoria Shipyards in Victoria, Halifax's Irving Shipbuilding Inc., and Davie Shipbuilding in Levis, Que.\n\nThe contracts are to maintain Canada's 12 Halifax-class frigates until the end of their operational lives, estimated at another 20 years.\n\nThe government says in a statement that after consultations, it was decided the infrastructure and workforce of the three Canadian shipyards were needed to work on the frigates. It was not immediately clear how the money would be divided among the three locations.\n\nGood news for Seaspan\n\nFor Seaspan Victoria, the announcement came as good news, although they must wait for 15 days during which time other federal companies can ask the federal government for a chance at the contract.\n\nSeaspan representative Tim Page said Thursday's news endorses work the company has already done on the Halifax-class vessels.\n\n\"We're proud that we've been able to continue to demonstrate our performance on budget and on schedule to deliver back to the navy the frigates that they bring into our care,\" Page said.\n\nAlthough it is not clear how much Seaspan's part of the contract would be worth, Page said the work would provide stable employment for 400 of their 1,100 employees at the shipyards.\n\n'It's both ineffective and uneconomical'\n\nKen Hansen, an independent defence analyst and former navy commander, said divvying up the work through untendered contracts between three shipyards is about politics.\n\n\"Any work that is awarded to Davie is done for the sake of politics,\" he said.\n\n\"It tells you that the power of the Quebec caucus in the Liberal party is really strong. They're able to compel these kinds of decisions against best practice.\"\n\nHansen said international best practice is to do repair and maintenance work in the ships' home port.\n\n\"If the ships have to travel a distance and get their work done elsewhere, it's both ineffective and uneconomical,\" he said.\n\nHansen added that dividing the repair work between three yards is reminiscent of the country's historic approach to shipbuilding.\n\n\"The various regions all had a slice of the shipbuilding pie and what ended up happening ... was this boom and bust cycle,\" he said, noting that it led to repeated gaps in work and layoffs.\n\nHalifax raises concerns\n\nLast month, workers at Halifax's Irving Shipyard raised concerns about repair work they currently do being transferred to Quebec.\n\nNova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said his government has spoken with Ottawa about maintaining work at the Halifax Shipyard.\n\n\"We've made the case to the national government that we believe the level of work should be maintained at the shipyard so they can hold on to the high quality talent that they currently have,\" he told reporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Ottawa says the work on the frigates is necessary while the navy awaits the delivery of replacement Canadian Surface Combatant ships.\n\nWith files from CBC's Liz McArthur", "As darkness fell Tuesday, Richard Sheppard knew he and his hunting partner were in trouble.\n\nSheppard and Scott Park had left Lark Harbour on Newfoundland's west coast earlier that day, with the intention of spending just a few hours hunting.\n\nWith no cell phone service and the area blanketed in thick fog, they became lost and hunkered down for the night with a fire.\n\n\"We both knew we weren't going to be found on top of a mountain because it was so foggy and there was no way anyone was getting to us,\" Sheppard told CBC Radio's Newfoundland Morning Show.\n\nInstead, they headed down the hill the next morning and eventually came out at a coastline about 16 kilometres off course.\n\nTwo hunters set out Tuesday to go moose hunting but ended up spending a night in the woods.

She was angry, paying little attention to the gold medal around her neck, the one that made history.\n\nYes, winning never gets old. It's just not why she does this.\n\nThe challenge whenever the greatest gymnast of her and any other generation steps onto the floor isn't to impress the judges so much as to meet her own impossibly high standards. The one that keeps nudging the 21-year-old to propel herself and her sport forward.\n\nSimon Biles wins 4th world championship:\n\nThe American gymnast overcame a kidney stone to post an an all-around score of 57.491 and win her fourth all-around title at the 2018 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Doha. 4:32\n\nAnd for two hours Thursday in Doha, for the first time in a long time, the momentum slowed. At least in the eyes of Biles, who didn't exactly sound like someone who had just become the first woman to win four world all-around championships, a feat she pulled off despite a handful of uncharacteristic errors to beat Japan's Mai Murakami and American teammate Morgan Hurd by more than 1.6 points (Canada's Ellie Black finished 12th).\n\nAmerican gymnast <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Simone_Biles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Simone_Biles</a> makes history by becoming the first woman to ever win four all-around titles at a world championship. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DohaGym2018?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DohaGym2018</a> <br><br>Here's the routine that secured her title!<a href=\"https://t.co/0OIvlZOXs0\">https://t.co/0OIvlZOXs0</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/22vWRtBQRG\">pic.twitter.com/22vWRtBQRG</a> \u2014@CBCOlympics\n\nIt's a sizable margin for nearly everyone else, but not for Biles. Battling a kidney stone that she insists is manageable, she sat down her vault in the first rotation, came off the beam on her third and stepped out of bounds on floor exercise.\n\n\"It's not the gymnast that I am, to go out there and kind of bomb a meet like this,\" said Biles after posting an all-around score of 57.491. \"Even though I won, I wish it were a little bit different.\"\n\nCanada's Ellie Black is 12th:\n\nThe Halifax gymnast placed 12th in the women's all-around competition at the 2018 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Doha. 1:30\n\nOnly it wasn't, a testament to the massive difficulty Biles packs into each event. What she's doing on floor exercise is as hard as anything the men can come up with. The vault \u2014 the one that will carry her name when code of points is updated \u2014 is so tough no other woman even attempts it in competition.\n\nDoing anything else would be \"boring\" as her coach Laurent Landi put it. Yet Biles doesn't use the remarkably high start values of her routines as an excuse when she doesn't hit them. There is no grading on a curve, at least not in her head.\n\nBiles jokingly asked Landi if she needed an 18 \u2014 a score not currently possible in gymnastics \u2014 heading into her floor exercise to catch Murakami. The deficit was actually 13.308 points, totally doable. Biles briefly thought about toning down her boundary pushing set for something a bit easier just to make sure she won. The internal wavering was fleeting.\n\n\"I would never,\" Biles said.\n\nPlaying it safe simply isn't her style. While her right foot did slip into the red out of bounds during her first tumbling pass, it hardly mattered. Her score of 15.000 was more than enough to rocket past Murakami and Hurd, the 2017 world champion.\n\n\"It's absolutely insane that she fell twice and won,\" Hurd said. \"I have no words.\"\n\nNeither did Biles, at least not any positive ones.\n\nWatch the full event:\n\nComplete coverage of the artistic gymnastics world championships from Doha, Qatar. 2:36:35\n\nMost meets with Biles typically start the same. She drills the vault \u2014 where she is the reigning Olympic champion \u2014 and then spends the next three rotations simply padding her lead to margins that look like typos.\n\nNot this time.

She came through but her emotions on the medal stand tilted more toward disappointment than joy.\n\n\"It just sucks that I did so bad and I still won,\" said Biles, who plans to compete in all four event finals. \"I wish it could not happen.

He was uncooperative and inattentive, and wouldn't do what was expected of him at school or at home.\n\nCormier said her son's first hospitalization for mental health reasons was at the age of nine, to the Janeway's mental health unit.\n\nSince then, he's also been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nHe began using drugs in his late teens and eventually became addicted to opioids. However, for the past two years he's been on a drug treatment program that involves injections to prevent withdrawal.\n\nNowhere to go\n\nCormier said Alexander's biggest obstacle to getting clean has been finding a suitable, long-term housing arrangement.\n\nShe sees him every day and helps with groceries, meals and laundry.

As long as Canadians see the benefits of immigration, he said, they support it.\n\n\"We cannot take what we have for granted. The anti-immigrant, anti-refugee rhetoric that is all around us \u2014 we are not immune to that,\" he said during a speech and question-and-answer session at the Canadian Club in Toronto.\n\n\"This is the challenge before me and all of us \u2014 to double down on immigration, but also to really, really communicate, and listen carefully and communicate the real benefits of immigration locally. Because if we don't, it's going to be difficult for certain people who have anxieties about the economy and about their future to see immigration as a positive thing.\"\n\nThe new communications campaign comes as the Liberals continue to be hammered by the Opposition Conservatives over border security and the government's handling of asylum seekers crossing into Canada outside of regular border points. The Conservatives have declared it a \"crisis,\" while the government insists it's a challenge that is being capably managed.\n\nAs part of the federal initiative, Hussen launched the \"Immigration Matters\" website, which provides information on how the system works and how immigration offsets the economic effects of an aging population by meeting the economy's labour needs.\n\nThe initiative comes a day after Hussen announced increased immigration levels, setting a new target of 350,000 for 2021. That's up 40,000 from this year's target of 310,000.\n\nSurge in global migration\n\nHussen said we are now living in a world where the word \"immigrant\" evokes starkly different responses as global migration reaches levels not seen since the Second World War.\n\nHe said Canada is isolated from the pressures of global migration patterns experienced in countries like Germany, where hundreds of thousands of people have arrived to claim asylum.\n\nMinister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Ahmed Hussen says Canada needs to keep up with it's immigration plan despite other countries closing their borders. 2:36\n\n\"We've been sheltered by three oceans and our border to the south. But as we've seen with growing numbers of asylum seekers crossing irregularly from the United States between ports of entry ... we're starting to see some of the challenges faced by others, although the numbers pale in comparison,\" he said.\n\nHussen said Canada must be vigilant in ensuring that newcomers integrate successfully, while listening to the legitimate concerns of people who fear immigrants will take jobs from Canadians. The government says its communications efforts will present statistics and showcase success stories to show that immigrants help the economy and create jobs for Canadians.\n\nImmigration critic Michelle Rempel said Canadians' confidence in the immigration system has been eroded by the Liberal government's handling of asylum seekers illegally entering the country outside official border points. They see that as a \"blatant abuse\" of Canada's social programs and a sign of the government's misplaced priorities, she said.\n\n\"Where Canadians have lost support for immigration over the last year stems from the fact that (Prime Minister) Justin Trudeau has created a new permanent stream of entry into the country with a zero-day wait time, which has no sort of criterion on who can enter it and places a great burden on Canada's social welfare programs,\" she said.\n\nTrudeau's approach to the immigration file has been \"unfocused, unplanned and ill thought out,\" she said.\n\nWrongly blamed for housing crisis\n\nAsked about the impact of asylum seekers on Toronto's housing situation, Hussen said newcomers are being wrongly blamed for a long-standing affordable housing shortage that existed before the current wave of border-crossers.\n\n\"To suggest that asylum seekers have contributed to a crisis with our shelter system I think is really misleading, it's very dangerous and it doesn't withstand scrutiny,\" he said.\n\nThe federal government has given Toronto $11 million to defray the costs of resettling asylum seekers, part of a $50 million package for Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba \u2014 the provinces most affected by those entering Canada outside official border points.", "I went to Calgary on the Tuesday thinking I was going to interview a woman who wanted to bring the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games to Calgary in 2026.\n\nMary Moran, the CEO of a group called BidCo, was supposed to answer my questions, in the historic, great hall of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, as to why this was the right thing to do 30 years after the success of the Games of Calgary in 1988.\n\nAs I boarded the plane in Toronto, Twitter revealed to me that Calgary City council's Olympic Evaluation Committee would consider abandoning the proposed bid and the scheduled plebiscite in the absence of a decipherable funding agreement between the three levels of government.\n\nAs the plane took off, I was at a total loss.\n\nScott Russell with Mary Moran:\n\nCBC Sports' Scott Russell sits down with Mary Moran, CEO of the group BidCo, on why pursuing the 2026 Olympics is the right decision for not only Calgary, but Canada as a whole. 9:41\n\nThe interview was surely a non-starter.

The factors placing each student at risk were sent to individual schools so they could develop strategies to help the children.\n\nThe program cost the school board $20,000 to develop, Racine said. It runs on open-source software.\n\nQuebec high school graduation rate lowest in Canada\n\nQuebec's Education Ministry has taken notice.\n\nRacine presented his initiative to administrators at the ministry Tuesday.

In Quebec, 57 per cent of boys graduate within five years, compared with 82 per cent in Ontario.\n\nRoch Chouinard, an education professor at Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, says graduation outcomes are not easily compared between provinces because of differences in their education systems.\n\nIn Quebec, for instance, primary school is six years and high school is five years, while in Ontario primary school is eight years with four years of high school.\n\n\"It's a little like comparing apples and oranges,\" he said.\n\nBut Chouinard is interested in the Val-des-Cerfs model if it can help students at risk.\n\n\"Students don't wake up and decide to leave school,\" he said. \"It's a process. The best prevention consists of closely following students.

But he'll be remembered most for being the first goaltender to wear a face mask on a regular basis,\" the CBC's Terry Walker told viewers when Plante died.\n\n\"Before, coaches didn't like the idea of goalies wearing something that might distract them, but Plante played just as well after adopting the face mask.\"", "Chaleur Regional Hospital's latest closure of the obstetrics unit comes after calls for higher pay and the training of more nurses fell on deaf ears, the president of the New Brunswick Nurses Union says.\n\nThis is the second time in two weeks the obstetrics unit at the Bathurst hospital has been closed because there aren't enough nurses.\n\nPaula Doucet, president of the nurses union, said nurses at in the unit were being overworked, which put them and their patients at risk.\n\n\"I think it was a good call on Chaleur Regional to ensure the safety of labouring moms, but also ensure the safety of their staff,\" said Doucet.\n\nUntil Tuesday at 8 a.m., pregnant women in the Bathurst area are being advised to travel to Miramichi or Campbellton to have their babies. The unit was also closed last week.\n\nThis summer, Doucet said, some nurses in the obstetrics unit were working shifts of 24 to 48 hours.\n\n\"That's not safe,\" she said. \"Nurses can't provide safe patient care.\"\n\n'Nobody's really taken us seriously'\n\nFor years, the union president has been warning government officials, universities and the two health authorities in the province about the cyclical shortage of nurses.\n\n\"I think it was falling on deaf ears, and that's where I think we are today,\" she said.\n\nOne of the biggest problems, she said, is that not enough people are going into nursing programs at the University of New Brunswick and the University of Moncton. And when students do apply to the faculty, there aren't enough seats, resulting in wait lists.\n\nWe've got a government right now that we're not sure where we're going with. It's been meeting and meeting and meeting and there's been no action plan put in place. -Paula Doucet , New Brunswick Nurses Union\n\nDoucet said it's up to the universities to determine how to spread their funding among faculties.\n\n\"We've been told for a number of years the faculty of nursing has been starving,\" she said.\n\nShe said government needs to earmark specific money for the faculty of nursing, so it can hire appropriate professors and have enough clinical instructors.\n\nThe University of New Brunswick accepts 140 nursing students in the province each year spread across four-year programs in Fredericton and Saint John as well as an advanced standing program in Moncton, according a university spokesperson.\n\nThe school also offers a two-year condensed program.\n\n\"In October, we graduated a class of 33 students from the two-year condensed program that is the only one of its kind in New Brunswick,\" said Dr. Lorna Butler, UNB's dean of nursing.\n\n\"We have filled the seats in this new program and expect it to help with the current situation in New Brunswick not only because it will increase the number of nurses graduating, but it will provide the workforce with nurses ready to be hired at a staggered rate.\"\n\nAttracting more young people\n\nDoucet said stakeholders met last December and discussed different ways to attract more young people to the profession.\n\n\"We've got a government right now that we're not sure where we're going with,\" she said. \"It's been meeting and meeting and meeting and there's been no action plan put in place.\n\n\"That's one thing we've been saying, we need to see an action plan. It's not five years out, it's now. We need it right now, we've been saying it for years and nobody's really taken us seriously.\"\n\nLittle compensation\n\nDoucet said another problem nurses face is compensation that isn't fair compared to the rest of Atlantic Canada.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, nurses in New Brunswick experienced a wage freeze. Now, their pay is about four per cent less than that of a nurse's salary in Nova Scotia.\n\n\"We're playing catch-up, when other provinces didn't impose those zeros on their staff,\" she said.\n\nWhen nursing students do graduate, they'll often only be hired as casuals at New Brunswick hospitals, she said.\n\n\"They're coming out of university with huge debt,\" she said. \"They want permanent part-time or permanent full-time work to pay down that student debt.\"\n\nCBC New Brunswick's Rachel Cave talks to New Brunswick Nurses Union president Paula Doucet about the short-staffing of nurses trained in obstetrics in several New Brunswick hospitals. 1:31\n\nOften, nurses will move to other Maritime provinces, where they can get permanent work, are paid more and still don't live too far from home.\n\nBefore the September election, Doucet said, she was able to meet with all five party leaders to make sure nursing was an important issue, and she's hopeful it will still become one.\n\nCBC News has also asked New Brunswick Health Minister Beno\u00eet Bourque for an interview but has not received a response.", "Rainfall warnings are in effect for Metro Vancouver, Howe Sound and the Fraser Valley with heavy downpours making flash flooding likely.\n\nBetween 50 and 80 millimetres are expected for those regions between Thursday and Friday morning.\n\nEnvironment Canada said that amount of rain is likely to cause flash floods, water pooling on the roads and localized flooding in low-lying areas.\n\nLandslides could also happen in vulnerable areas like steep slopes, the agency said.\n\nA City of Vancouver staffer works to clear a clogged storm drain during a storm that led to localized flooding in parts of the city on Oct. 29, 2018.

Are you?\n\nFollowing a few tense days of last-minute funding talks between the city, the province, and the federal government, Calgary city council voted 8-7 to pull the plug and cancel the bid for the 2026 Winter Games.\n\nBut since 10 votes were needed, the motion failed. So, the process continues and Calgarians themselves will have their say during the plebiscite on Nov. 13.\n\nThere are strong arguments in favour and strong arguments opposed. The Olympics are a mega-project unlike any other, with countless considerations and differences of opinion. There are numerous intangible benefits: the promotion of sport, community and national spirit, marketing Calgary to the world, and so on.\n\nBut tangible costs and benefits are the focus for many. Put plainly, we are talking about money. And it's here where bold claims are made by proponents and opponents alike.\n\nTime for a reality check.\n\nThe Olympics won't fix everything\n\nThe bid corporation touts gains of $4.4 billion for the city, $1 billion in wages, over 15,000 jobs, and a 10-to-1 return for city funds invested. It's one of the main talking points of the Yes campaign and of the bid corporation.\n\nBut they're mistaken. Demonstrably so.\n\nFirst, the broader employment and GDP gains are based on questionable economic models that few economists take seriously.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, to base our Olympic-sized decision on current economic challenges is unwise. In the coming year or two, there is every reason to believe many of Alberta's economic wounds will have healed. Today, the recovery is already underway.\n\nEmployment in the province remains approximately 35,000 jobs below where it needs to be to get back to 2014 levels (adjusting for population growth, aging, and other factors). But most of that is accounted for by young workers aged 15 to 24.\n\nFor many young people \u2014 predominantly young men \u2014 a large problem remains. High-paying, lower-skill jobs were available in oil and gas, construction, and manufacturing during the boom years. Those jobs aren't coming back anytime soon. And we should not think that hosting an Olympic Games will bring them back sooner.\n\nYes, Calgary's recovery is slower than elsewhere, and its unemployment rate was largely flat over the past year.\n\nBut recoveries are often painful and slow. There are no quick fixes. No magic bullets.\n\nRetraining, changing jobs, or getting workers to move cities all takes time. Spending on the Games will be many years away, and are of little benefit to unemployed workers today. The much touted Olympic-related jobs are not the answer.\n\nReturns are not 10-to-1\n\nA particularly bold claim by the bid corp. is that Calgary will receive back $10 for each $1 the city puts in.\n\nThis is creative accounting.\n\nIt counts as \"money coming back to Calgary\" such things as: spending on soldiers, police, and so on. It counts spending by Calgarians themselves on such things as Olympic tickets and merchandise \u2014 money that would likely have been spent on other things anyway. It also counts spending on compensation for Olympic staff that aren't Calgarians. And it counts imported materials, equipment, and so on.\n\nAgain, this $4.4-billion figure cited as a gain for the city is merely the cost of staging the Games. It's money the city won't be paying, but that doesn't make it all an economic gain for Calgary.\n\nYes, the Games do leverage significant public dollars from higher levels of government. As a result, Calgary may be left with valuable new and refurbished sports venues at a lower cost than would be on offer without the Games.\n\nBut as money is such an issue here, it's worth looking deeper at exactly who will pay what.\n\nThe Games come at a cost\n\nThe federal government will contribute $1.42 billion, while the province chips in $700 million, and the City of Calgary will contribute $390 million. These are manageable.\n\nWhat does it mean to you? Well.\n\nThe city raises just over half its property taxes from businesses, and just under half from homeowners. Split between the two, the $390-million cost is equivalent to more than $350 per residential property in the city and nearly $15,000 per non-residential property (i.e., business).\n\nWe don't know how the city plans to fund this, but let's presume it simply takes out more debt. This means future interest costs and repayments that would require something around a 1.3 per cent increase in annual property taxes, or $25 annually for the median home owner, but significantly more for the typical business. (This is napkin math, but gives a good sense of scale.)\n\nScott Hutcheson, board chair of the Calgary 2026 bid corporation, centre, listens to Calgary city council debate motions to kill the 2026 Winter Olympic bid and cancel a Nov. 13 plebiscite on whether it should proceed Wednesday. The motion failed. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)\n\nThe city is already challenged by rising property tax bills on businesses in the city, as downtown vacancy rates are high. Without higher bills for residential property owners, business have made up much of the slack. The Olympics may make this challenge even more difficult.\n\nAnd then there's the money the province would have to come up with.\n\nSince oil prices fell, our deficits have soared. Despite the economic recovery, Alberta's financial situation today remains rough. The government has already made difficult choices, and may have to make many more.\n\nThe province has already reduced its infrastructure budget dramatically. In 2017, Alberta planned to spend $23.6 billion on capital projects between 2018 and 2021. In its 2018 budget, however, the government trimmed that to $18.4 billion over the same period. Balancing the books will require difficult decisions, and reducing capital spending by $5.2 billion was one of those decisions.\n\nThere are now roughly four dozen school modernization and construction projects on the government's unfunded capital projects list, and nearly two dozen road and highway projects.\n\nGiven such constraints, finding money for Olympic infrastructure means taking it away from somewhere else. It's fair enough to prioritize the Games above other projects, but we must recognize that is the choice before us. This is true even if the government borrows more to cover the costs \u2014 the trade-off is merely pushed into the future.\n\nPublic funds have alternative uses. It's a difficult reality. But it's a reality nonetheless.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nFor the bid corporation to frame its primary talking point around overly optimistic economic impacts is unfortunate. And for the process to have been so opaque is disappointing.\n\nTo do this better, our leaders should engage with citizens with full information about all aspects of this decision. They should trust Calgarians with more than spin.\n\nThe costs of staging the Games are real, as are many of the benefits. But claims of enormous economic gains made by proponents are not. The right question to ask is whether the costs are worth the non-economic benefits. And on that, between now and Nov. 13, we will each have to reach our own conclusion.\n\nThis column is an opinion.

You can be part of the community discussion by joining our Facebook group.\n\nThe poster child for single-use plastic waste has taken another hit in Newfoundland and Labrador, but it's unclear what the next step is to combat the overall environmental problem.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation is no longer offering plastic bags in its stores. Instead, customers have the choice of free paper bags, reusable ones for 99 cents, or bringing their own.\n\nIt was a decision made, in part, because customers asked for it, and a move the NLC says has been welcomed since first announced in September.\n\n\"We have received nothing but positive feedback,\" said Wally Dicks, the NLC's chief operating officer.\n\n\"Most customers are happy and think we're doing the right thing. Even our suppliers have said the same thing.\"\n\n\u200bThe bag ban comes on the heels of a wave of criticism about excessive cannabis packaging. While the NLC regulates marijuana in the province, its packaging is federally mandated by Health Canada, and cannabis companies such as Canopy Growth have said that issue is a work in progress.\n\n\u200b The NLC encourages people to either buy its reusable bags for 99 cents or bring their own from now on. Paper bags will also continue to be available. (Sherry Vivian/CBC)\n\nConversation changer\n\nAfter today, there may still be a few liquor store plastic bags in circulation, said Dicks, as stores rid themselves of remaining inventory.

Same could be said for straws, which were bashed this year as well,\" said Walker, adding the symbolism of banning bags, and its ability to be a conversation starter, are the bigger environmental wins.\n\n\"What I see coming out of this in terms of positive action, is it probably changes people's interaction now with other types of single-use plastics.\"\n\nTo ban, or not to ban\n\nThe debate over a provincewide plastic bag ban has dragged on in the public arena for years, with the issue lobbed back and forth between levels of government and organizations to a tedious and confusing degree.\n\nPrior to the NLC's move, some private retailers \u2014 like those on Fogo Island \u2014 made the leap to a ban within their own stores.

(Lindsay Bird/CBC)\n\nA five-pence success\n\nThere are other options to reduce bag consumption besides an outright ban. Some countries rely on levies or taxes: England introduced a five-pence consumer charge for bags in 2015, and its government reported nine billion fewer bags have since been sold as a result.\n\nEngland's charge is not a tax, and while its government asks retailers to donate the collected fees to a good cause, there's no mechanism forcing them to do so.\n\nWhile a plastic tax can be hard for citizens to stomach, Walker said, if governments make it transparent that monies collected are going toward a good cause, such as environmental outreach. it can make the extra cost much more publicly palatable.\n\nThe NLC told CBC the 99-cent price tag for its reusable bags is just cost-recovery for the product, with nothing leftover. The corporation does expect to save $180,000 a year by no longer supplying plastic bags.\n\nDalhousie University professor Tony Walker says reusable bags trump plastic ones since reusable materials will break down eventually, while plastic has an extremely long lifespan. (Submitted)\n\nWhat's a shopper to do?\n\nIf by now you're overwhelmed at the thought of your next grocery store run, add this into the mix: it isn't even clear whether the environmental footprint of reusable bags trumps that of a single-use plastic one.\n\nAn oft-cited British study \u2014 utilizing data from 2006 \u2014 declared a cotton bag has to be reused 131 times in order to offset its carbon footprint, which contributes to climate change: think of the production put into growing cotton, or the facilities needed to weave the fabric. By the same logic, a paper bag should be reused three times.\n\nWalker maintained reusable bags remain the better choice, as what studies like that one fail to consider is the environmental cost of plastic's unfortunately immortal qualities.\n\n\"Cotton, if there's no print or inks on it, it could be composted,\" he said. \"Paper, at the end of its useful life, has very few, if any, environmental impacts. But we know that plastic, if mismanaged and gets into environment, has long lasting impacts.\"\n\nIn the face of government inaction, a hodgepodge of retailer bans and even personal plastic fatigue, Walker maintained consumers are still able to affect change, and the NLC's move is proof of that power.\n\nThere's no one solution, no one silver bullet for this problem. - Tony Walker\n\n\"We do have a choice. We can choose to just stick to the status quo, and the massive convenience brought about by plastics and just carry on as normal, or in the face of overwhelming evidence on this, is to make a personal choice. and that can be bringing your reusable bag,\" he said.\n\n\"There's no one solution, no one silver bullet for this problem.

The length of those contracts can vary from a single course or semester, to full-time or multi-year.\n\nAccording to one of the report's authors, Chandra Pasma, a senior research officer with CUPE, the common link is the \"long-term insecurity for the people in those positions.\"\n\n\"There's a lot to be concerned about in terms of the faculty at Nova Scotia universities being precarious and the impact that that has on education,\" Chandra said in a telephone interview from Ottawa.\n\nAmong the consequences, according to Chandra, is contract staff have less time to prepare for courses, they must undertake research on their own time without support or money from the institution, they find it difficult to stay on top of current research, and they aren't as available to students because they don't have an office on campus.\n\nThe study calls for three things to improve the situation: \"adequate and sustained public funding, greater transparency about hiring practices and a commitment to improved labour standards.\"\n\nProvince unconcerned\n\nLabi Kousoulis, Nova Scotia's minister of advanced education, isn't surprised by the findings, nor does he seem concerned about the number of contract employees at Nova Scotia institutions.\n\nHe points to the fact there's no mandatory retirement age for professors as the reason universities may be struggling to control costs.\n\n\"Tenured professor at the end of their career is a lot more expensive than a young tenured professor,\" Kousoulis told reporters Thursday following a cabinet meeting.\n\n\"So what universities are facing is the cost pressure of having tenured professors working past 65, and in some instances if they didn't have that cost pressure they could replace a professor with more than one.\"\n\nThe minister didn't think the number of contract teachers was having any effect on the quality of instruction.\n\n\"We know the universities are hiring people who have the ability and the expertise to teach the courses,\" he said.\n\n\"Many of the courses I took at university were taught by professionals in the business community. When I took law it wasn't a professor teaching it, it was actually a lawyer.\"\n\nAs for contract employees outnumbering permanent staff, he said: \"I think this will work itself out.\"\n\nWhat's happening elsewhere\n\nThe situation isn't unique to Nova Scotia.

(Robert Guertin/CBC)\n\nThe researchers also found a difference between Halifax-area universities and those outside the city.\n\nAt universities in and around the Halifax area, including Acadia University in Wolfville, contract appointments made up nearly 55 per cent of faculty appointments. The rest of Nova Scotia was about 45 per cent.\n\n\"I think what it suggests is that in a larger market, where there's multiple schools and there's more people, universities don't have to offer as much in order to entice faculty to come,\" said Pasma.\n\nThe percentage of contractual employees at Canadian universities varied wildly by faculty or discipline, according to the report.\n\n\"The greatest number of contract faculty appointments are found in fields aimed at a particular profession (agriculture, architecture, business, education, engineering, law, library science and veterinary medicine), followed by the health sciences and the humanities,\" said the report.\n\nAccording to the report, 96 per cent of people teaching architecture are under contract.\n\nDalhousie wanted $55K to retrieve info\n\nSimply getting the information on which to base the national report proved a chore to the researchers, who filed freedom-of-information requests to get their data but were sometimes stonewalled.\n\nNova Scotia institutions were more forthcoming, with one notable exception.\n\nThe Dalhousie University administration originally requested $14,000 to retrieve the information, but when Pasma filed an appeal to Nova Scotia's freedom-of-information commissioner, Dalhousie boosted that amount to $55,000.\n\nThat estimate is still under appeal, despite the fact Pasma was able to get the information she needed from the university's faculty association, which receives it every year as a matter of course.\n\n\"I'm not entirely sure what is motivating this tactic, because when I look at the information that was provided by the Dal Faculty Association and CUPE [Local] 3912, it suggests that not much has changed at Dalhousie.\"", "The chief investigator of the Nova Scotia SPCA is speaking out against the sentence handed to a Cape Breton woman whose puppy starved to death in the backseat of her car.\n\nJo-Anne Landsburg of the SPCA, who removed the remains of the emaciated husky from the car last year, said the \"particularly disturbing case\" warranted a jail sentence and a lifetime ban on owning animals for Bethany MacLean.\n\nInstead, a Halifax provincial court judge sentenced MacLean, 22, earlier this week to four months of house arrest followed by 20 months of probation after she pleaded guilty to a charge of animal cruelty.\n\n\"It's something that \u2014 I don't want to say that we're used to \u2014 we just have to move forward and onto the next one,\" said Landsburg. \"There's more animals to save.\"\n\n10-year ban on owning animals\n\nIn addition to the house arrest and probation, MacLean must do 75 hours of community service and is banned from owning any animals for a period of 10 years.\n\n\"We probably would have liked to see a lifetime prohibition, at least, on this person,\" said Landsburg.\n\n\"That didn't happen so we're a little bit frustrated with that.

(Nova Scotia SPCA)\n\nThe court heard MacLean allowed her puppy, named Keisha, to starve to death in the backseat of her car, which she had abandoned in the parkade of the Park Lane mall in downtown Halifax in March 2017. The car was discovered by mall employees two months later.\n\nA veterinarian pathologist testified at MacLean's sentencing that the dog's death probably took weeks.\n\nSentence elicits anger, frustration\n\nThe Crown had argued for a 90-day jail sentence while the defence had asked for a conditional discharge. The judge ultimately rejected both options before sentencing MacLean to house arrest.\n\nThere have been several increasingly angry social media posts since the sentence was handed down Tuesday. And Landsburg said the SPCA has been fielding calls from angry and frustrated members of the public.\n\n\"I don't know if anger really helps any situation,\" she said.\n\n\"But I can really say that when we look to the public to help us and support in strengthening our animal protection laws, the public are very helpful and supportive in that in most cases.\"\n\nFines not always effective\n\nLandsburg said the provisions of Nova Scotia's Animal Protection Act and those sections of the Criminal Code dealing with animal cruelty are sufficient, but she'd like to see stiffer penalties imposed.\n\nThere have been cases elsewhere in the country that have led to jail time and higher fines, and Nova Scotia seems to be slowly catching up, she said.\n\nLandsburg added that fines can be of limited use in these situations because frequently an offender doesn't have the means to pay.\n\nOn occasion, the SPCA will look for restitution because it can cost thousands of dollars if the organization has to seize an animal in distress. However, she said restitution can also be difficult to collect.", "A community centre in Glace Bay is getting a much-needed roof repair thanks to a business with Cape Breton ties.\n\nThe Morrison Campus Y's Men's Centre is housed in the former Morrison junior high school, which the Glace Bay Y's Men's and Women's Club purchased from the Cape Breton Regional Municipality for $1.\n\nThe 100-year-old building is in good shape for the most part, said manager Greg Barns.

His friends remember him as a kind man who smiled often. (Mohammad Bakhash/Submitted)\n\nThe father of five was one of the first Syrian refugees to settle in New Brunswick in 2015. The tradesman took English classes at the Multicultural Association of Fredericton and, two winters ago, went snowmobiling with his children for the first time.\n\nAlsalh, 49, was also one of the first Syrian newcomers in the province to die, casting light on a problem for the growing Muslim community: where to bury the dead.\n\nA challenge for Muslims\n\nAlsalh got sick quickly in early September, dying within 48 hours of arriving at the Dr. Everett Chalmers Hospital.\n\nIt was up to the survivors, including his friend Mohammad Bakhash, to figure out what came next.\n\nSome things were painful but routine: breaking the news to Alsalh's teenagers, and figuring out the logistics, including a death certificate.\n\nIn 2015, the Alsalh family was one of the first two Syrian families to arrive in Fredericton. In this CBC archive photo the families are being welcomed by Premier Brian Gallant and federal cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc. (CBC Archives)\n\nBut the routine ended there, Bakhash says. Getting Alsalh buried was more complicated.\n\nAlsalh's body had to be taken from a Fredericton funeral home to Sussex, a 120-kilometre drive away, because that's the nearest Muslim cemetery in the province.\n\nBoth newcomers\n\nAlsalh was a close friend of Bakhash; their bond wasn't difficult to forge.\n\nThe two men arrived in Fredericton just a month apart, both Syrian refugees trying to start a new life in a province where fewer than 3,000 Muslims lived.\n\nWhen Mohammad Bakhash lost his friend Alsalh, he didn\u2019t expect the hour-long trek to the cemetery to pray over the body and bury it. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC)\n\nWhen you start a new life, Bakhash says, you're thinking ahead \u2014 about the language barrier, your children adjusting to new schools and new friends, your own career, trying to get accreditation in your field.\n\nYou're not thinking about where you're going to be buried.\n\nIslamic rules\n\nMuch like in life, Muslims must follow specific, but varying, rules when someone dies. People have different interpretations of Sunnah, or the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed, regarding the practical aspects of burials.\n\nSome people believe headstones should be simple and uniform, because rich and poor people are equal in death and in the eyes of God. Others do not forbid ornate headstones.\n\nSome people believe there should be an exact 10-metre distance between where Muslims and non-Muslims are buried.\n\nOthers also believe the deceased must be in the ground within 24 hours of their death.\n\nAccording to Islamic rules, a cemetery can be shared, but the Muslim section must be separated from where people of other religions are buried by a certain distance, which can vary. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC)\n\nBut the basic rules are mostly the same: the body must be washed and wrapped by family or close relatives shortly before the burial, the funeral must be quiet, the body should be prayed over by funeral attendees, and the cemetery must be fairly distant, or at least fenced off, from where non-Muslims are buried.\n\nGenerally speaking, a Muslim cemetery must, therefore, be separate and have a building with running water, where the body can be washed and wrapped.\n\nFamily and friends buried Hasan Alsalh in the Sussex cemetery early September. 4:18\n\nThe procession to Sussex for the burial of Hasan Alsalh \u2014 75 people in 20 cars, driving down Highway 2 to a small shared cemetery \u2014 was disheartening.\n\n\"We use the highway, which included a high rate of risk for the people who are in the ceremony and for the people who are using and sharing the highway with us at that time,\" says Bakhash, who believes burial is a basic human right.\n\n\"For many times, we have to stop at the right of the highway waiting [for] each other, some people were slower than the others.\n\n\"We moved him by my own car, which is not provided with any cooling system. So it was really hard time.\"\n\nBakhash and the procession had trouble finding the cemetery at first. It's a few kilometres east of the centre of Sussex, a town of about 4000, at Evergreen Memorial Park.\n\nSimple, flat plaques\n\nA U-shaped road leads in, then out of the Evergreen cemetery. The Muslim section is at the point where the road turns back around.\n\nIt's cordoned off by a green, metal fence. At first glance, the section looks empty, because the headstones lie flat on the ground.\n\nUsually, a plaque bears only the name of the deceased, year of birth and year of death. Some are also inscribed with \"mother\" or \"my angel.\"\n\nThe Muslim cemetery in Sussex is a few kilometres east of the town centre, at Evergreen Memorial Park. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC)\n\nA highway overpass runs perpendicular to the cemetery and looks down on the green. The silence of the space is punctuated by the sound of cars and trucks whisking by and an occasional bird caw.\n\nAfter the body of Alsalh was washed and wrapped in cloth, 25 men carried it on their shoulders to the gravesite, chanting the Tawhid in Arabic, which translates to \"There's no God but Allah.\"\n\nThey placed the modest cardboard coffin on the ground, facing the direction of Kaaba in Mecca, and stood shoulder-to-shoulder to pray over the body a final time, before lowering the coffin into the ground.\n\nMohammad Bakhash says driving his friend to a faraway cemetery made him wonder about members of his own family, and whether they\u2019ll have to make that trek in more hazardous conditions. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC)\n\nBurying his friend made Bakhash wonder what his family \u2014 his wife and four young children \u2014 would go through if he died. Would they have to make this trek in the winter?\n\n\"I might be the next, so who should handle the process at that time? \u2026 Would we like to wait for summer, for example, to have good weather to have safe drive? Some things don't wait for our circumstances. We have to face regardless of the weather, regardless of whatever.\"\n\nWhy Sussex was chosen\n\nTwenty years ago, if a Muslim died in New Brunswick, the family had to drive the body to Truro, N.S., for the burial. That's where the only Muslim cemetery in the Maritimes was.\n\nMohamed El-Bayoumi of the Fredericton Islamic Association was there when people in Moncton, Fredericton and Saint John decided Truro was too far and put their dollars together to buy five acres in an existing cemetery in Sussex, a town of 4,000 people in the south of the province.\n\n\"It's been serving us really, really well,\" El-Bayoumi says.\n\nHe moved to New Brunswick from Egypt four decades ago to study at the University of New Brunswick. When he wasn't power boating or competing in swimming meets, he was conducting marriage ceremonies and funerals. He's also been an imam, leading prayers at the mosque on Lincoln Road.\n\nMohamed El-Bayoumi was asked by the Fredericton Islamic Association to find land to bury Muslims closer to home in Fredericton.\n\nMuch like his studies in engineering, the business of cemeteries in New Brunswick is about numbers, he says.\n\nWhen he moved to New Brunswick in the 1970s, he was one of a handful of Muslim people there.\n\nIn the early '90s, the population increased slightly, to 15 Muslim families from all over the world, some Arabic-speaking from the Middle East like himself, others from India and Pakistan.\n\nThat growth prompted a push for a New Brunswick cemetery.\n\nBut why the sleepy town where there are virtually no Muslim residents?\n\nAn affordable, central place\n\nEl-Bayoumi says the idea was to find a somewhat central location, where it's not favouring one of the big cities while still being able to afford the price of the land.\n\nIn November 2015 the government of Canada committed to taking in 25,000 government-assisted refugees from camps in Lebanon and Turkey, as well as directly from Syria.\n\nAlmost 2,000 settled in New Brunswick.\n\nMohammad Bakhash and Mohamed El-Bayoumi discuss their community's search for a cemetery closer to home. Currently, Fredericton's Muslims have to travel to Sussex to bury their dead. 1:42\n\n\"We're probably a thousand individuals [in Fredericton], so the statistics and the possibility, the probability, of having death \u2014 it's becoming more and more frequent than before,\" El-Bayoumi says.\n\nEl-Bayoumi is retired now and has been focusing solely on finding space for a Muslim cemetery in Fredericton.\n\nWhere is Sussex?\n\nEvery Friday after the prayer, people approach him and ask: when are we going to have a cemetery?\n\n\"They consider it a bit off the main track,\" he says of Sussex. \"It's not Saint John, it's not Fredericton, it's not Moncton. Who knows about Sussex? Where is Sussex?\n\n\"In particular, with the newcomers, the new arrivals and the new generation, they don't want to do this. They want to have something here in Fredericton.\"\n\nEl-Bayoumi says he\u2019s approached by people every Friday after prayer asking when he will be able to find them a cemetery closer to home. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC)\n\nA lot of people don't have the means to make the trip to visit the graves of loved ones, which Muslims are expected to do at least twice a year.\n\n\"In our culture, as you know, you're supposed to visit the cemeteries now and then because it shows you the finality of life,\" he says. \"So it's a very good reminder that this is where all of us gonna go.\n\n\"It's time to search when you are alive. When you die you're not going to look for a place at that time. You search now and you prepared now not to wait for the last minute.\"\n\nRaising money\n\nThe Islamic rules are not the only hindrance. For a while, it was also about money.\n\nThe Fredericton Islamic Association bought a piece of land in 2014, but it turned out to be wet and not suitable for digging and burying.\n\nAfter a few more years of searching and fundraising El-Bayoumi found a promising spot: one in an existing cemetery at St. Francis of Assisi church in Lincoln.\n\n\"That is a win-win situation because we help the existing cemetery, we help with the cost of running it and operating it and at the same time we have a place,\" he says.\n\nThis is exactly what Moncton did in 2009, when two elderly men took it upon themselves to raise money, buy land and partner with a funeral home to run the burials.\n\nThe Sussex cemetery is considered \u2018off the main track,\u2019 El-Bayoumi says. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC)\n\nThe one thing that was holding El-Bayoumi back was that he needed permission from the Catholic diocese to be able to buy the land. He sent a letter explaining the Muslim community's predicament and offering $30,000 for the land on Aug. 24.\n\nThe group then waited weeks for a response. When CBC News began making calls about the potential arrangement, the church contacted El-Bayoumi and asked for a meeting.\n\nThey still need to figure out logistics but El-Bayoumi says this purchase could be ideal for the community and reassure members there's somewhere to bury their loved ones.\n\n\"A Muslim cemetery is no different than any other cemetery,\" he says. \"It does not generate anything in particular other than a reminder to all of us, all people of the book, all humans, that we all going to die.\"\n\nEl-Bayoumi wrote a letter to the Catholic Church, offering to buy a piece of land in an existing cemetery in Fredericton. (Hadeel Ibrahim/CBC)\n\nChurch officials haven't returned CBC News calls but have met with El-Bayoumi and assured him they will do their best to help, he says.\n\n\"I believe it's one of the basic human rights for any part of the society to have a place for their beloved people, to have them to be close enough to visit them at any time, to pray for them, to eases the process of having them at the cemetery,\" Bakhash says.", "EDITOR'S NOTE: CBC reporter Elias Abboud travelled to Kuujjuaq on Ungava Bay this week to cover an emergency meeting of Nunavik's leaders called by school board officials to discuss how to respond to a rash of youth suicides in recent weeks.

But it wasn't a surprise.\n\nNiagara residents have become increasingly angry, for example, at the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority (NPCA), which has regional councillors on its board.\n\nThere's a perception, says regional councillor-elect Jim Bradley, that the NPCA is more interested in money than protecting natural resources.\n\nAn auditor general report this year found the NPCA had \"significant operational issues.\" Those included board members who overstepped their bounds. Resident Ed Smith also compiled a report critical of the authority, and the authority sued him.\n\nThere were issues with the media too. Last December, for example, regional staff called the police on St. Catharines Standard reporter Bill Sawchuk. Sawchuk, they alleged, was secretly recording an in-camera session. An Ontario Ombudsman investigation found that he wasn't, and his removal was \"unjust and wrong.\"\n\nOnly eight councillors are returning on the 31-member council. (Google Maps)\n\nThen this spring, the Standard published a series of investigative articles around the hiring of CAO Carmen D'Angelo. Regional chair Alan Caslin, it says, gave D'Angelo the questions before his job interview. Then Caslin, the Standard reported, unilaterally extended D'Angelo's contract.\n\nPeople paid attention. During the campaign, \"people were angry,\" Ip said. \"And they knew exactly why they were angry.\"\n\nCaslin ran for regional council reelection in St. Catharines. He placed 20th out of 23 candidates.

It contracts out bus operations to local bus companies, which must provide coaches with Wi-Fi, USB and power outlets, free audio books, video games and movies, and extra legroom.\n\nIn return, FlixBus generates all the routes and connection planning, provides real-time GPS bus tracking for passengers, does extensive marketing, and operates an online sales platform centred on its mobile app. Operators keep 70 per cent of the revenue from ticket sales.\n\nA large number of FlixBus employees work in software and data collection to help support the company's technology platform, including its booking app. (FlixBus)\n\nAt the core of the company is technology and data.\n\nOf its 1,200-plus employees \"about 25 per cent work in engineering\" explained Schwammlein, \"and, like, another 30 to 40 per cent of people are working on data.\" That means more than half the staff is working on software or crunching numbers to help plan routes and schedules, and set fares using dynamic pricing.\n\nU.S. expansion\n\nOne of FlixBus's first American partners was Dan Palmer of American Explorer Motorcoach, whose family has been in the bus business as a tour and charter operator since the 1970s.\n\nPalmer is based in Arizona and runs a FlixBus route between Tucson, Phoenix and Los Angeles.

(Smith School of Business)\n\nHe says the key is that those investors are willing to wait for profits to come gradually as the company takes over markets.\n\nLitrico points out the partnership model has been used by other bus companies, but he sees the FlixBus approach winning over investors now because of a wider trend of \"vertical disintegration.\" This is when companies focus on niche parts of their business and outsource others \u2014 such as Uber not owning cars, or Airbnb not owning properties.\n\nHe says the rise of FlixBus \"would never have been possible 10 years ago, before smartphones.\"\n\nCan it work in Canada?\n\nBut bus operators say FlixBus faces a different world in Canada.\n\n\"I think the biggest factor is trying to get people out of their cars,\" said Dean Wright of Pacific Western Transportation, which owns the Alberta-based Red Arrow and Ebus lines.

It's almost 10 years later and to find out there's as much support as there was 10 years ago, it really holds you together.\"", "With the election of Jair Bolsonaro to the Brazilian presidency, the far-right has taken power in Latin America's largest and most populous country, which also has one of the world's largest economies. How, if at all, should Canada and Canadian business react?\n\nA recent report for CBC News charted economic opportunities with this new regime, noting that \"a Bolsonaro presidency could open new investment opportunities, especially in the resource sector, finance and infrastructure, as he has pledged to slash environmental regulations in the Amazon rainforest and privatize some government-owned companies.\"\n\nBut diving in for the sake of short-term financial profit would be ethically irresponsible and politically catastrophic. Bolsonaro unashamedly praises the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for 20 years, from 1964 to 1985. If we proceed as though it were business as usual, we would normalize his breach of a long-standing democratic consensus.\n\nTrade as a political transaction\n\nEvery economic transaction is also a political transaction, and nowhere is this more true than in the realm of international trade and foreign investment. Governments have long combined commercial deals with strategic objectives: from the 19th-century opium wars \u2014 in which the Royal Navy fought to open China to British merchants \u2014 to the recent renegotiation of NAFTA, politics and economics go hand in hand.\n\nBut since the Second World War especially, the discourse around trade has been about more than simply self-interest. For instance, U.S. post-war economic assistance to Western Europe (the Marshall Plan) was designed to reinforce liberal democracy by ensuring economic recovery and removing the temptation of more radical solutions, i.e. to ward off the Communist threat.\n\nThis Cold War logic framed international trade for 40 years: the Soviet Union provided economic and military assistance to its satellites, while the United States did deals with dictators and other unsavoury regimes (in Guatemala, Iran, the Philippines, and so forth) where it considered it necessary for the broader narrative of protecting the \"free world.\"\n\nWith the end of the Cold War, the narratives were modified but didn't disappear. Ethical as well as political considerations came to the fore in arguments either for or against economic engagement. At times, both the left and right argued for sanctions to effect political transformation (though they disagreed about when: whether apartheid South Africa or Communist Cuba, for example), but at other times they also often claimed that integration into international norms was better served by the exchange of ideas and attitudes that accompanies the traffic in goods and services.\n\nTrade with China during the Bill Clinton era was justified based on the premise that engagement encouraged openness and increasing liberalization of partner nations. (Doug Mills/The Associated Press)\n\nIn the U.S. during the Bill Clinton era, for example, maintaining preferential trade relations with China (\"most favoured nation\" status) was justified, despite concerns over human rights abuses, on the grounds that engagement encouraged openness and increasing liberalization, sidelining hardliners within the regime.\n\nSimilar arguments have, until very recently, been used to justify economic contracts with Middle Eastern states such as Saudi Arabia, though these justifications would often be criticized as merely a cover for economic interests. Few people, for example, believe that the Gulf War was really about freedom for Kuwaitis rather than oil for the U.S. and its coalition partners. But the point is that, however paper-thin, those justifications had to be in place: trade and military intervention alike demanded a broader story of progress or development \u2014 one that went beyond naked self-interest.\n\nThe private sector has started telling similar tales, marketing their activities in terms of social change. Apple adverts once featured images of figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King alongside the slogan \"Think Different;\" Facebook tells us that its mission is to \"give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\"\n\nEven industrial behemoths such as resource extraction followed suit, despite evidence of their destruction of the environments and livelihoods of vulnerable populations, and of their long-term impact on the planet. British Petroleum, for example, adopted a leafy-looking green and yellow logo suggestive more of horticulture than oil wells; mining giants everywhere began speaking of community benefits and their need to secure a \"social license to operate.\"\n\nDispensing with old trade narratives\n\nAll this is now changing, with countries and corporations increasingly dispensing with such exculpatory formulas. The key figure is doubtless U.S. President Donald Trump, who more than anyone has rejected the narrative of trade as a vehicle to liberal progress. His mantra \"Make America Great Again\" inverts the age-old adage of \"private vice, public virtue\" to assert that the only political rationale needed is self-interest. It is in this context that Brazil's lurch to the right will be welcomed as an investment opportunity to some, and its environmental and political consequences cast to the wind. The sense that some broader political justification is required has faded.\n\nIn much of Latin America, the overarching political narrative of the past 30 years has been \"Never Again.\" Just as post-war European politics has been marked by the collective decision never to return to the internecine conflict (and horrors such as the Holocaust) of the First and Second World Wars, likewise the ground of political debate and policy in the Southern Cone (Argentina, Chile, Brazil) and elsewhere has been a social consensus, shared by all parties and sectors, that a return to the authoritarian regimes of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s should be unthinkable.\n\n\"Never Again\" (\"Nunca M\u00e1s\" in Spanish; \"Nunca Mais\" in Portuguese) was the title of the reports on human rights abuses published in Argentina and Brazil. But with his open praise of the dictatorship, new president Jair Bolsonaro is dramatically breaking that pact and taking the country in a harmful, regressive direction. In the absence of any other narrative, then, Canadian engagement (political or economic) that takes advantage of his election for short-term gain inevitably becomes complicit in this broader story of democracy's decline.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

(Brigil and NEUF Architect(e)s)\n\nExtra height\n\nIn a design brief submitted with its application, Brigil describes the cluster of towers as a landmark that will signal the start of Ottawa's urban area for anyone arriving from the east.\n\nBrigil is asking for extra height on each of the four new towers, but the biggest increase would be for the connected pair on the west side of the site.\n\nAt 32-storeys, one tower would stand 158 metres even though current zoning allows for just 101 metres. Brigil would like its mate to be 22 storeys, or 26 metres higher than what's currently allowed.\n\nIt would be a shame to see LRT open its doors to an empty field. - Coun. Bob Monette\n\nThe city planner in charge of the file is accepting comments from the public until Nov. 23.\n\nThe file will then go to planning committee in December or January, after the new city council is sworn in, and will fall to incoming councillor Matt Luloff.\n\nBig dreams for Trim Road\n\nThe residential piece is only one part of the puzzle for outgoing Coun. Bob Monette, who sees the whole area around Petrie Island and Trim Road evolving by the time light rail arrives.\n\nSpecifically, he worked to change the official plan in the area to allow for a commercial and employment node beside the Cit\u00e9 Coll\u00e9giale satellite site.\n\n\"That's been my No. 1 priority. It would be a shame to see LRT open its doors to an empty field,\" Monette said.\n\nBrigil even has a concept plan with a few office towers, retail and a convention centre.\n\nMonette said he's worked non-stop with other levels of government to try to entice a major employer to the site, ideally the federal government.

This is shaping up to be an interesting event, with two reigning Olympic champions making their Grand Prix season debuts.\n\nYou can watch all the action live on CBCSports.ca beginning Friday at 9 a.m. ET.\n\nNo Canadians are competing this week (many took to the ice last week at Skate Canada), but there's still plenty to look forward to. Here's a breakdown of what to expect in each competition:\n\nMen: Will Hanyu be at his best?\n\nThe men's event is of particular interest to me, with two-time Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu facing off against Toronto training mate Juhnwan Cha of South Korea. The two last met at September's Autumn Classic, where Cha took top spot in the free skate and second overall, just behind Hanyu.\n\nHanyu is occasionally known for not being his strongest self in the early part of the season. He's not alone in that regard. China's Boyang Jin is a two-time world bronze medallist who can be brilliant or struggling, depending on the day. The same applies to Czech skater Michal Brezina, whose first Grand Prix outing this season earned him a silver medal. It remains to be seen who will rise to the occasion in Finland.\n\nWomen: Zagitova is the real deal\n\nIt's clear now: Olympic champion Alina Zagitova is no flash in the pan. With the exception of a fifth-place finish at the 2018 world championships, where she was suffering from exhaustion, Zagitova has won every event she has entered from December 2016 until now. This includes claiming the 2017 junior world championship and the 2018 Olympic title.\n\nThe Russian finished first overall in the ladies program on Saturday at the ISU World Junior Figure Skating Championships in Taipei with a winning score of 208.60. 6:48\n\nI see Zagitova's biggest threat coming from Skate America silver medallist Kaori Sakamoto. The two talented women have shared podiums before, with Zagitova taking gold to Sakamoto's bronze at the 2016 Junior Grand Prix Final and the 2017 junior worlds.\n\nPairs: Russians step up\n\nI have my fingers crossed that 2018 junior world champions Daria Pavliuchenko and Denis Khodykin of Russia can make an easy transition to the senior ranks. It's not that I expect them to finish on the podium, but I always like having a peek into the future, especially at the start of a new Olympic quadrennial.\n\nI do, however, expect fellow Russians Natalia Zabiiako and Alexander Enbert to climb the top step in Helsinki. Poised and well-trained, with a silver medal as part of the Olympic team event in 2018 and a fourth-place finish at the 2018 worlds, Zabiiako and Enbert are the team to beat.\n\nItalians Nicole Della Monica and Matteo Guarise should also challenge for the podium. Della Monica and Guarise trailed Zabiiako and Enbert by less than two points at worlds in March, finishing in fifth place, and will make closing the gap between them the goal.\n\nIce Dance: Stepanova and Bukin no ordinary team\n\nThe two strongest teams in the ice dance field are both looking for the same thing: more international recognition and the chance to move up the ranks. At last year's worlds, Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin of Russia finished in seventh place and I expect them to lead the competition in Helsinki.\n\nTheir closest rivals are the Italian team of Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri, who finished in ninth place at worlds in March of 2018. My impression of the Italians' improvement in the off-season was confirmed by their silver medal at Skate America.\n\nBut Stepanova and Bukin are a strong team with a sizzling free dance that, when compared to the Italians' conventional choreography, is anything but ordinary.\n\nPj's gold-medal picks\n\nMen: Yuzuru Hanyu (Japan)\n\nWomen: Alina Zagitova (Russia)\n\nPairs: Natalia Zabiiako and Alexander Enbert (Russia)\n\nIce Dance: Alexandra Stepanova and Ivan Bukin (Russia)", "On a cool, October morning on a lake as clear as glass, volunteers geared up at the Belle River Marina in Lakeshore, Ont. to reel in the big muskie.\n\nAbout 40 anglers sent their fishing lines into the water alongside employees of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to \u2014 hopefully \u2014 catch at least 20 muskies.

Parker said there was a 2006 outbreak of viral hemorrhagic septicemia, a disease which killed of tens of thousands of muskies in Lake St. Clair.\n\n\"Doing stuff like this here, we can see where the muskies are going and then if they're surviving and it really is something important to give back to the lake, so we can keep an eye on where the fish are going so we can see maybe why are these diseases hurting them and why are some things not hurting them.\"\n\nTags aren't cheap\n\nKnowing there's a healthy supply of muskies is good for business.

Four years earlier, Badakhshan\u200b had slit her throat and stabbed her repeatedly before setting their rooming house in Toronto's Annex area on fire.\n\nFarrant said when he first sought help he was told \"over and over\" that he wasn't legally allowed to talk about deliberations. A statement of claim he filed to in Ontario Superior Court says he was later diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression following the trial.\n\n\"For the most part Canadians go through the jury duty unscathed, but we know many have not, especially on difficult and lengthy trials,\" he told CBC's The House.\n\nEx-jury foreman Mark Farrant says he developed PTSD after serving as a juror in a murder trial, but found Ontario did not offer services to help him.

Everything good costs money.\"\n\nSusan Ormiston set out on foot with the migrants again today, and saw what desperation leads them to do:\n\nSusan Ormiston reports that the migrants are not deterred by threats, warnings, or Mexico's move to block their access to buses. 1:45\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders praised Mexico for stopping the migrants from getting rides. \"Mexico has stepped up in an unprecedented way,\" Sanders told Fox News. \"They have helped stop a lot of the transportation means of these individuals in these caravans, forcing them walking. They have helped us in new ways to slow this down, to break this up and keep it from moving as aggressively toward the United States.\"\n\nThe Mexican government has, in fact, taken a fairly contradictory stance on helping or hindering the caravan, reflecting the country's balancing act: Officials don't want to irk Trump, but Mexicans themselves have long suffered mistreatment as migrants.\n\nCentral America migrants in Juchitan, Mexico, will have to continue on foot towards the United States after failing to acquire buses. (Hannah McKay/Reuters)\n\nFor the first week of the caravan, Mexican federal police sometimes enforced obscure safety rules, forcing migrants off paid mini-buses, citing insurance regulations. They also stopped some overloaded pickup trucks carrying migrants and forced them to get off.\n\nBut in recent days, officials from Mexico's immigrant protection agency have organized rides for straggling women and children as a humanitarian effort. And police have routinely stood by as migrants piled aboard freight trucks.\n\nMore caravans en route\n\nA second, smaller group of 1,000 or so migrants is more than 320 kilometres behind the first caravan. A third band of about 500 from El Salvador made it to Guatemala, and a fourth group of about 700 set out from the Salvadoran capital Wednesday.\n\nAltogether, the four caravans represent just a few days' worth of the average flow of migrants to the United States in recent years.\n\nSimilar caravans have occurred regularly over the years and passed largely unnoticed, but Trump has focused on the latest marchers seeking to make border security a hot-button issue in next week's midterm elections.\n\nMigrants received medical care in a makeshift camp in Juchitan, with one saying the 'sacrifice is worth the effort.' (Hannah McKay/Reuters)\n\nThe Pentagon has announced it is sending 5,200 troops to the southwest border, with their role largely limited to such activities as providing helicopter support, installing concrete barriers and maintaining vehicles. Trump said Wednesday that number could go as high as 15,000.\n\nWorn down by days of long walks, many migrants have dropped out and returned home or applied for protected status in Mexico.\n\nThe initial caravan has shrunk significantly from its estimated peak of more than 7,000 migrants. A caravan last the spring ultimately fizzled to just about 200 people who reached the U.S. border at San Diego.\n\nMexican Interior Secretary Alfonso Navarrete Prida said about 2,300 migrants have applied to stay in Mexico under a government plan, and hundreds more have accepted assisted repatriation.\n\nAlso Wednesday, a Guatemalan woman gave birth to the first known caravan baby at a hospital in Juchitan. Mexico's governmental National Human Rights Commission said it had arranged for medical attention for the woman, who was 28 weeks pregnant, and the girl was healthy.", "As migration rises worldwide, so has its toll: The tens of thousands of people who die or simply disappear during their journeys. Barely counted in life, these migrants rarely register in death \u2014 almost as if they never lived at all.\n\nA growing number of migrants have drowned, died in deserts or fallen prey to traffickers, leaving their families to wonder what on earth happened to them. At the same time, anonymous bodies are filling cemeteries in South Africa's Gauteng province, or in the coastal Tunisian town of Zarzis. Similar cemeteries dot Italy, Greece and Libya.\n\nAn Associated Press tally has documented more than 56,800 migrants dead or missing worldwide since 2014 \u2014 almost double the number found in the world's only official attempt to try to count them, by the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. The IOM toll as of Oct. 1 was more than 28,500. The AP came up with almost 28,300 additional dead or missing migrants by compiling information from other international groups, forensic records, missing persons reports, death records, and examining data from thousands of interviews with migrants.\n\nThe AP's tally is also certainly an undercount. Bodies lie undiscovered in desert sands or at the bottom of the sea. And families don't always report loved ones as missing because they are illegal, or because they left home without saying exactly where they were headed.\n\nCaught between hope and mourning\n\nInstead, families are caught between hope and mourning, like that of Safi al-Bahri. Her son, Majdi Barhoumi, left their hometown of Ras Jebel, Tunisia, on May 7, 2011, for Europe in a small boat with a dozen other migrants. The boat sank and Barhoumi hasn't been heard from since. In a sign of faith that he is alive, his mother and father built an animal pen with a brood of hens, a few cows and a dog to stand watch until he returns.\n\n\"I just wait for him. I always imagine him behind me, at home, in the market, everywhere,\" said al-Bahri. \"When I hear a voice at night, I think he's come back. When I hear the sound of a motorcycle, I think my son is back.\"\n\nSafi al-Bahri poses with a photo of her son, Majdi Barhoumi, who went missing in 2011, at her home in the town of Ras Jebel, Tunisia. (Nariman El-Mofty/Associated Press)\n\nThe official UN toll extensively documents deaths in the Mediterranean and Europe, but even there cases fall through the cracks. The political tide is turning against migrants in Europe just as in the United States, where the government is cracking down heavily on caravans of Central Americans trying to get in. One result is that money is drying up for projects to track migration and its costs.\n\nFor example, when more than 800 people died in an April 2015 shipwreck off the coast of Italy, Europe's deadliest migrant sea disaster, Italian investigators pledged to identify them and find their families. More than three years later, under a new populist government, funding for this work has been cut off.\n\nVastly underestimating the true toll\n\nBeyond Europe, information is even more scarce. Even in the U.S., where migration has turned into a hot-button issue, there is no routine effort to figure out where migrants may disappear or die, nor a policy on identifying bodies and notifying families. And little is known about the toll in South America, where the Venezuelan migration is among the world's biggest today, and in Asia, the top region for numbers of migrants.\n\nThe result is that governments vastly underestimate the true toll of migration, a major political and social issue in most of the world today.\n\n\"No matter where you stand on the whole migration management debate ... these are still human beings on the move,\" said Bram Frouws, the head of the Mixed Migration Centre, which has done surveys of more than 20,000 migrants in its 4Mi project since 2014. \"Whether it's refugees or people moving for jobs, they are human beings.\"\n\nThe missing include children, although once again the scant data is only in Europe. Some 2,773 children have been reported to the Red Cross as missing en route to Europe, and 2,097 adults reported missing by children.\n\nNo idea how to find his family\n\nAlmass and his brother, both migrants from Khost, Afghanistan, are not on the list. He was just 14 when his widowed mother reluctantly sent him and his 11-year-old brother from their home into the unknown. The payment for their trip was supposed to get them away from the Taliban and all the way to Germany via a chain of smugglers.\n\nBut when the Iranian border police fired on their group, Almass lost hold of his brother's hand and went unconscious as he tumbled down a ravine. He never saw his brother again. When he next spoke to his mother, he couldn't bring himself to tell her; instead, he lied that his brother couldn't come to the phone but sent his love.\n\nAlmass, an 18-year-old Afghan who lost his younger brother at the Iran-Turkey border four years ago, describes the journey from the province of Khost to his current home in in Gentioux-Pigerolles, France.
