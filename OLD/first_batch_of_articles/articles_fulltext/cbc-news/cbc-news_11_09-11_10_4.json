["A Whistler B.C. man hopes to reunite what he believes to be a domesticated pigeon with its original owner, but admits his family is enjoying have the animal around.\n\nIn September, Mark Beaven went outside his home and noticed a pigeon nearby. He thought seeing the bird was unusual for Whistler because he rarely sees them.\n\nA couple days later, he went out on his balcony and the same pigeon flew up to meet him. Beaven held out his hand to the bird, and it marched over and began pecking at it.\n\nSince then, the pigeon has become like an additional member of Beaven's family.\n\nIt is now named Walter P. John \u2014 after Canadian actor Walter Pidgeon \u2014 and the Beaven family is on a quest to find its original owner.\n\n\"He's a bit of a character. He walks around in circles cooing, and flaps his wings in his morning routine,\" said Beavens.\n\n\"It just puts a smile on our faces. We've grown quite fond of him.\"\n\nThe Beaven's figure Walter is a domesticated pigeon, because it is exceptionally receptive to humans. The family feeds Walter a diet of primarily water and popcorn kernels.\n\nIt wasn't until the Beavens posted a photo of the bird on Facebook, that they received any information about the bird's origins.\n\nThe plot thickens\n\nOne of Mark Beaven's neighbours saw the picture of Walter, and told him that an unknown man had been sleeping in his van on his property for a few nights\n\nEventually the neighbour asked the man to leave, but he told Beaven's neighbour that he couldn't, because he had lost his pigeon.\n\nWalter is of the animal family Columbidae, which includes pigeons and doves \u2014 animals famed for their intelligence. (Roshan Beaven)\n\nThe neighbour gave Beaven a description of the mysterious man's van, and any other information he could. Beaven and his family have since made posters and distributed them around Whistler.\n\nBeaven says they have not yet received any tips, but admit they are getting used to having the bird in their home.\n\n\"We hate to see him go,\" he said.\n\nWith files from The Early Edition", "A Canadian-led international movement seized with staunching the flow of refugees wants to use an untapped source of cash to address the global crisis: the billions languishing in the frozen bank accounts of dictators and despots.\n\nThe proposal will be one of the main recommendations of the World Refugee Council, a self-appointed body of two dozen global political figures, academics and civil-society representatives led by former Canadian foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy.\n\n\"We've put forward a proposition that where there are frozen assets they should be unfrozen through a proper legal process and reallocated to help the victims of the crime and corruption and instability that the bad guys create,\" said Axworthy. \"It's a morality play. The bad guys have to pay to help their victims.\"\n\nThe World Bank estimates the pool of cash to be worth $10 billion to $20 billion per year, Axworthy said in an interview.\n\nThe council was established last year by a Canadian think-tank, the Centre for International Governance Innovation, to find new ways to deal with the 21st century's record-setting migration crisis \u2014 the 68.5 million displaced people driven from their homes by war, famine and disaster.\n\nThe United Nations will turn its attention to solving the problem at a special session later this fall, and the council plans to offer its input, using the weight of the last Canadian foreign minister to chair a Security Council meeting.\n\nThe UN has acknowledged in stark terms that as the number of homeless and stateless people continues to grow around the globe, their suffering is increased by the shrinking pool of money available to help them.\n\n'Proceeds put for the public good'\n\nAxworthy says there are fundamental structural flaws in how the world's institutions are set up to cope with the unprecedented forced migration of people, and a big one is how the bills are paid. The system is based on charity \u2014 the benevolent donations of people, countries and businesses \u2014 and is not sustainable, Axworthy said.\n\nAn October report by the United Nations refugee agency said it expected to raise 55 per cent of the $8 billion it needs to support refugees and internally displaced people this year.\n\nAxworthy said the courts in several countries can be used to seize funds that have been frozen there. Canada, the United States and Britain have all passed legislation allowing them to impose sanctions on individual human-rights abusers. These \"Magnitsky laws\" are named after a Russian tax accountant who died in prison after exposing a massive fraud by state officials there.\n\nLloyd Axworthy, left, is presented with the 30th Pearson Peace Medal by Gov. Gen. David Johnston during a ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa in May 2017. (Fred Chartrand/Canadian Press)\n\nThe world could start spending the \"tens of billions of dollars moulding away in a variety of banks and other places, purloined money from the warlords, from the bad guys, the dictators, the authoritarians,\" Axworthy said.\n\nIrwin Cotler, a former Liberal justice minister and human-rights lawyer who has championed Magnitsky-style legislation, said in a separate interview that these laws can allow to go beyond freezing funds, because once the assets are seized, there's no point to returning them to their corrupt owners.\n\n\"What you want to do is have the proceeds put for the public good,\" said Cotler, the founder of the Montreal-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.\n\nLegal precedent\n\nCanada's first round of sanctions under its Magnitsky Act targeted people in Russia, South Sudan and Venezuela, including Nicolas Maduro, the South American country's president.\n\nThe refugee council's most recent report, released last month, focused on the displacement of millions of people from Venezuela. That report urged the United States to take a leading role in seizing billions of \"ill-gotten\" assets in the country, including the $2 billion that the U.S. Treasury Department estimates has been stolen from Venezuela's state-owned oil company.\n\nFen Hampson, who co-wrote the report and is head of the global security program at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, suggested governments need to go beyond their various Magnitsky laws to repurpose the seized assets of \"Maduro and some of his henchmen ... to help victims and the host countries that are reeling under this growing refugee and migration crisis.\"\n\nWatch: Russia upset over Canada's Magnitsky Act\n\nThe Magnitsky Act, named after a Russian lawyer and auditor who was arrested on trumped-up charges and died in prison, has Russia threatening retaliation against Canada. The proposed law targets those responsible for human rights abuses and corruption. 2:15\n\nThe report said there is legal precedent to do this: a civil case against the son of the dictatorial leader of Equatorial Guinea resulted in a $30-million judgement, $20 million of which was later used by a charity to help the country's people.\n\nIn Yemen, where most of the inhabitants of the port city of Hodeida were forced to flee Friday as Saudi Arabia's three-year war on Shiite rebels continued, the UN World Food Program's country director said a massive cash influx is needed to repair the battered economy and feed a population on the verge of starvation.\n\nStephen Anderson said it's up to others, higher up in the UN, to decide whether that money should be siphoned from a warlord's frozen bank account.\n\n\"We're 100-per-cent voluntary funded,\" Anderson said. \"The economic issues need to be addressed urgently because that's affecting the entire population of Yemen. They were the poorest in the Middle East before the conflict so there's no safety net.\"", "An estimated 50,000 people marched in Montreal to show their support for climate action on Saturday, as part of a wider campaign with sister marches happening in cities throughout Quebec.\n\nThe march was organized by a group called The Planet Goes to Parliament.\n\nSpokesperson Nathalie Roy said that the movement was born out of increasing frustration from citizens during the recent provincial election campaign.\n\n\"It started because we needed to channel the indignation we felt about the fact that, during the campaign, there was very little said about environmental issues \u2014 where we feel a true sense of urgency.\"\n\nThe group has held five protests this fall, and the crowds keep getting bigger.\n\nOrganizers estimated the crowd turnout at 50,000.

William (Andrew) White, was the first black commissioned officer and chaplain in the Canadian Expeditionary Force when he enlisted in the No. 2 Construction Battalion in 1917, according to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.\n\nThe segregated battalion was comprised entirely of black men who volunteered to engage in war work. The unit's 500 soldiers were unarmed and never saw combat.\n\n\"He began an effort to lobby to have black men serve when the army was segregated and they didn't want blacks involved,\" said Sheila, who never met her grandfather. He died of cancer before she was born.\n\nHonorary Capt. William (Andrew) White's sermons and mementos from the First World War are on display at the exhibit.

(Sarah Lawryuik/CBC)\n\nQ: What do you make of the advance voting numbers?\n\nA: Well, they are pretty high by plebiscite standards. If you compare them to last year's civic election, which was a record breaking turnout, about 75,000 people turned out in the advanced voting.\n\nIf you do a little back-of-the-envelope guesstimate, it suggests we maybe have a voter turnout percentage in the high 30s, maybe even low 40s for this plebiscite.\n\nQ: Is this surprising for you?\n\nA: Yeah, if you compare that guesstimate to past results in past Calgary plebiscites, typically those numbers are very low \u2014 especially for plebiscites that don't happen at the same time as the municipal election.\n\nIf those numbers hold, that's pretty good by municipal plebiscite standards.\n\nQ: Why are numbers typically so low?\n\nA: When you have a plebiscite at the same time as the municipal election, usually people will vote in it because they show up anyway. When you hold the plebiscite at a different time from the municipal election, people have to be really motivated by just that one question to go out to the voting station, wait in line and determine how they're going to vote. So often, there's just a question of motivation and voter knowledge that that keeps turnout low.\n\nQ: It's been about 20 years since the last plebiscite, what have we seen in terms of turnouts in the past?\n\nA: Typically in off-cycle plebiscites you're talking about somewhere between 10 and 20 per cent, very, very low rates.\n\nIn Vancouver they had low turnout off cycle plebiscites until the Olympic plebiscite, which had a 46 per cent turnout. So we were likely to see quite a bit higher for the Olympic plebiscite compared to these other ones in the past.\n\nCalgary's Olympic plebiscite vote is less than a week away. The results will give a glimpse into Calgarians are feeling about being a potential host city. But what can the history of Olympic plebiscites, the turnout and their results reveal about the possible outcome? Jack Lucas has been looking into that data. He is the director of the Urban Policy Program and an associate professor of political science at the University of Calgary. 6:50\n\nQ: What is it about the Olympics that draws these kinds of numbers for a plebiscite?\n\nA: It's just a big ticket item in every sense.\n\nPeople who support the Olympics are very motivated by it. They're inspired by the idea of having the Olympics in their city, people who are worried about the Olympics see the enormous price tag.\n\nThat motivates people to get out and vote. And it just gets a lot of attention in the media and in general conversation, particularly, as you've seen, in the last couple of weeks.\n\nQ: Which side will win the debate?\n\nA: That's the question of the hour. I think the if you're on the no side, the good news is that the polls suggest that the no side has a majority in Calgary right now.\n\nWhat's more, is older folks tend to be more opposed than younger folks based on the polling data. And there was older folks are the same people who tend to turn out to vote in municipal elections more than the younger people do.\n\nSo, on the yes side, you look at those turnout numbers. And you think maybe this is just a question of motivation. And if they get our supporters to turn out to vote more than the opponents will turn out to vote, maybe they can squeak this one out.\n\nDifferent voter turnout\n\nLucas did a little digging when he saw that this time around there were more voters than in the 2017 civic election.

He lost that status after he was convicted of a string of crimes, including break and enter, theft and drug trafficking. He was placed in immigration detention in 2012 as he waited to be deported.\n\nAccording to a statement of claim filed in Ontario Superior Court on Oct. 29, Niyonzima was placed in solitary confinement and suffered a mental breakdown in 2013 that rendered him catatonic.\n\nWhile in solitary confinement, he alleges he was denied proper food, clothing, medical care and yard time and was permitted to take only three showers over the course of a year. He alleges he was also subjected to \"painful and forcible\" electroconvulsive therapy. In 2016, he was released on a temporary resident's permit.\n\n'Worst thing that could happen to me'\n\n\"Honestly, it was just really, really hard to deal with that,\" Niyonzima told CBC Toronto at his lawyer's office. \"It's just the worst thing that could happen to me.\"\n\nNiyonzima is seeking $50 million in general damages and $15 million in aggravated damages.

He says he was denied mental health treatment in immigration detention.\n\n\"The plaintiff suffered pre-existing mental-health issues from childhood trauma following the Rwandan genocide in which his parents and three siblings were massacred. The plaintiff's mental health issues were known to the defendant,\" the statement of claim reads.\n\nNiyonzima, who currently lives in Toronto, said there is no question that immigration detention aggravated his mental health issues.\n\n\"I was already depressed and I was hearing voices ... and it just made things worse,\" he said.\n\nNiyonzima was held in the Toronto West Detention Centre, the Central East Correctional Centre in Lindsay, Ont., and St. Lawrence Valley Correctional and Treatment Centre in Brockville, Ont.\n\nSubodh Bharati, Niyonzima's lawyer, says his client never should have been left in solitary confinement for two years, and calls the treatment 'horrendous.' (Lorenda Reddekopp/CBC)\n\nLawyer Subodh Bharati, who is representing Niyonzima, said the government must take responsibility for how it treated his client.\n\n\"The treatment was horrendous. It's not the type of treatment we would expect the Canadian government to do to its most vulnerable people,\" he said.\n\n\"Here is an individual put in solitary confinement for two straight years and treated as though he's not human.\"\n\nTrauma began at early age\n\nFor \u200bNiyonzima, trauma began at an early age. He recounts witnessing family members beaten and captured in front of him when he was just 11.\n\n\"I was very scared and I was shaking and I couldn't move for, like, 20 minutes,\" he recalled. \"I was standing in one spot and I was just shaking.\"\n\nHe said all those family members \u2014 his father, uncle and grandfather \u2014 were later tortured and killed. He also lost his mother and three siblings in the genocide.\n\nAt age 13, he came to Canada and was adopted by an aunt who was accepted as a refugee. At that age, he obtained permanent residency status.\n\n\n\nBy 2001, he had a criminal record, serving time in jail for several offences.\u200b Niyonzima's last offence was in 2010.\n\n'Government didn't listen'\n\nAfter that, records show he was diagnosed with depression and anxiety that was connected to post traumatic stress disorder. The PTSD is said to be based on what he witnessed as a child.\n\nHis lawyer noted that, once his client started receiving psychiatric treatment, the criminal activity stopped. But because of the crimes, Niyonzima lost his permanent residency and was set to be deported back to Burundi.\n\n\"We have... psychologists, psychiatrists, doctors saying, 'Don't put him in detention, it can exacerbate his mental health issues,'\" said Bharati, his lawyer.\n\n\"And the government didn't listen. He's put in a small box, a room, and he's left there for two straight years.\"\n\nWhen Niyonzima found out he had a daughter, born in 2009, the claim notes his behaviour improved.\n\nAccording to his lawyer, Niyonzima was involved in her life from 2010 until he was put into detention two years later, and he saw the girl for the last time in 2013 at the detention facility.\n\nThe girl's mother was unable to care for her at that time and she was going to be adopted.\n\n\"I love her so much ...

It just makes you sigh. - Hudson Carpenter\n\nEver since Hudson was diagnosed at age eight with Type 1 diabetes, we've encountered people who assume his medical condition is the result of him not eating well.\n\nIn fact, Type 1 diabetes is not diet related. It's an incurable, life-threatening, super-challenging auto-immune disorder.\n\nPeople develop Type 1 diabetes after their immune system attacks and kills the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, people die because their bodies are unable to convert food into energy.\n\nLiving with Type 1\n\nTo survive, Hudson needs to prick his fingers and do blood tests several times a day.\n\nHe's connected to an insulin pump 24 hours a day and has a continuous glucose monitor attached to his arm.\n\nHudson has to calculate the carbohydrates in every single thing he puts in his mouth to give himself the right dose of insulin.\n\nWe're often up in the middle of the night trying to prevent low blood sugar or high blood sugar \u2014 either of which can be deadly.\n\nIt's kind of scary because you might fall asleep and never wake up and that's every night. - Hudson Carpenter\n\nOn one of the social media accounts I run to raise awareness about diabetes, I occasionally post pictures of blue candles.\n\nThese candles mark the passing of children who have died from diabetes. Sometimes these children die from having low blood sugar in the middle of the night. Other times it's because their symptoms of Type 1 diabetes are misdiagnosed as the flu.\n\nThese children end up falling into a coma and never come out of it.\n\nAs you would expect, these stories aren't very funny.\n\nReinforcing misinformation\n\nPeople make diabetes jokes as a reflex, without really thinking about what they are saying.\n\nThey don't realize that in making these jokes they are perpetuating misinformation about a really complex and difficult disease.\n\nSome people feel like it's \"OK\" to joke about diabetes because they associate Type 2 diabetes with people being overweight \u2014 and fat-shaming is one of the last areas where people seem to think that it's acceptable to mock and make fun of others.\n\nObviously, this is also unacceptable. It's also inaccurate \u2014 people can be thin and active and still develop Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIt's well past the time to start breaking the stereotypes around diabetes.\n\nInsensitive comments and jokes about diabetes are exceedingly common in our society. When you listen for them, you start to notice them.\n\nHudson and I notice them all the time.\n\nNadine Pedersen, whose son has Type 1 diabetes, says they live with the stigma of many people assuming that all diabetes is a result of not eating well - when, in fact, her son's condition is an incurable, life-threatening autoimmune disorder. 7:19\n\nWith files from The Early Edition", "Many businesses and services will be closed on Sunday or Monday to mark Remembrance Day.

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade had not yet been announced by either team and was still pending NBA approval, which might not come until Monday.\n\nJustin Patton will also be sent to Philadelphia, and Jarryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick are also going to Minnesota, the person said.\n\nThe Athletic first reported the agreement.\n\nMinnesota has traded Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to Philadelphia for Robert, Covington, Dario Saric and a 2022 second-round draft pick, league sources tell me and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonKrawczynski?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JonKrawczynski</a>. \u2014@ShamsCharania\n\nAddition of Butler bolsters 76ers' chances\n\nPhiladelphia's \"Process\" led it to the second round of the playoffs last season behind two of the game's youngest, brightest stars in big man Joel Embiid and point guard Ben Simmons. Butler, an elite wing and outstanding defender, will join them in a quest to rule the Eastern Conference now that LeBron James has left that league to join the Los Angeles Lakers following eight straight trips to the NBA Finals with Miami and Cleveland.\n\nThe first order of business will be making the trade official, something that could come in time to get Butler in uniform for a game at Miami on Monday. The next step for Philadelphia will be coming to an agreement on an extension for Butler, a pending free agent who made clear to Minnesota that he would not be re-signing there in 2019.\n\nTranslated: The Wolves had to trade him, or they would lose him for nothing over the summer.\n\nInevitable move\n\nThere has been Butler drama every step of the way this season.\n\nESPN reported that at his first practice with Minnesota this fall, Butler verbally challenged players, coaches and general manager Scott Layden while dominating in scrimmages, even when going up against stars like Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins.\n\nButler said the report was true.\n\n\"All my emotion came out at one time,\" Butler told ESPN later that day. \"Was it the right way to do it? No. But I can't control that when I'm out there competing. That's my love of the game. That's raw me. Me at my finest, me at my purest. That's what you're going to get inside the lines.\"\n\nButler has been miserable in Minnesota, and the Timberwolves have gotten off to a lousy start waiting for this inevitable move to happen. Minnesota just finished an 0-5 road trip with a loss in Sacramento on Friday night and is 4-9 overall \u2014 winless in eight games on the road.\n\nButler played in 10 of those games, averaging 21.3 points. It was a peculiar arrangement; the Timberwolves were still running things through him often, even while the worst-kept secret in the NBA was that he wanted a change of address. Plenty of teams were mentioned along the way \u2014 Houston, the Los Angeles Clippers, Miami among them \u2014 as top candidates.\n\nButler, who turned 29 on Sept. 14, has been an all-star in each of the last four seasons. There are also concerns, though they clearly didn't put off Philadelphia. Butler has missed at least 15 games in four of the last five seasons, including a career-high 23 games last year while dealing with a knee injury.\n\nPhiladelphia will become Butler's third team, after Chicago and Minnesota. He's a career 16.5 point-per-game scorer, though that is skewed by his first two seasons that were very meagre on the scoring front. He's on pace this season to average at least 20 points for the fifth consecutive year.\n\nWelcome to the best sports city in America <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimmyButler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JimmyButler</a> ! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/76ers?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#76ers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qrT9FaOSJE\">https://t.co/qrT9FaOSJE</a> \u2014@cj_wentz\n\nFresh start for all\n\nSaric is in his third season and averaging 11.1 points, shooting only 36 per cent. Covington had been a starter for Philadelphia for the bulk of the last four-plus seasons and is averaging 11.3 points per game this year.\n\nPhiladelphia and Minnesota don't meet until Jan. 15. Butler's return trip to Minnesota this season would be March 30, when he's sure to be showered with boos from a Target Center crowd that jeered him at the beginning of the home opener before quickly letting up. Butler had 33 points on 10-for-12 shooting from the floor in 36 minutes that night against Cleveland, a reminder amid the drama why coach Tom Thibodeau was so eager to acquire him the year before.\n\nPaired with Towns and Wiggins, the first overall picks in the 2015 and 2014 drafts, respectively, Butler immediately provided the experience, tenacity and defence the Wolves were missing, in addition to his scoring touch. He loved playing for Thibodeau, his coach for his first five seasons with the Bulls, and they helped Minnesota get to the playoffs last spring for the first time in 14 years.\n\nBut the roster never truly meshed. Butler used his brash, blunt personality to challenge Towns and Wiggins to become more consistent defenders.\n\nAnd now, a new start awaits them all.", "In the video to promote the opening of his restaurant, co-owner Jake Lee stands with farmers looking at a herd of cattle. Lee is discussing the importance of food transparency and knowing where your food comes from.\n\n\"I just don't like it when I go to a restaurant and the server or the chef are not able to talk about the food,\" he laments, stroking his chin. A lack of pride and passion are issues, he adds.\n\nIt's difficult to look past Lee's large, mirrored sunglasses and hoodie-covered head and take him seriously while he talks with farmers about food transparency. But he's right.\n\nDining experiences where servers either have no information \u2014 or spew false information \u2014 happen all the time. I'm glad to hear Lee vow to do better at his new downtown Edmonton restaurant, DOSC.\n\nLee has fallen short of his promises to do better.\n\nI forgave DOSC the first two times I went \u2014 opening jitters and all that.\n\nDishes like the sweetbreads and tendon stew were so horrendous as to be inedible; the bread so dull a communion wafer would have been a better substitute. Another visit for cocktails was so marred by bartender behaviour that I've blanked much of it out. Visit Four for breakfast left me hangry, even after I was fed.\n\nVisit Five involved a burger \u2014 or what was described as one.\n\nWhen the Filet O'Fish-style object was placed before me, I had to ask if it was indeed a burger. The server divulged a wave of questionable rhetoric, and when another server exuding the confidence of management stopped by to inquire about my meal, I asked her to explain the \"wagyu katsu burger.\"\n\n\"DOSC no longer has managers,\" she explained. \"We now have an innovative circle system.\"\n\nThe Wagyu Katsu Burger - a breaded, deep-fried ground beef patty - was an unsatisfying experience on many fronts, including finding out what it was. (Twyla Campbell/CBC)\n\nI didn't know what that meant. Something to do with Silicon Valley, I remember her saying before she gave her explanation of the burger's name.\n\n\"Katsu is an area in Japan and is also the name for the sauce that the meat is marinated in.\"\n\nI didn't have the heart to tell her that katsu isn't a place but is actually a term for a meat cutlet that's been flattened, coated with bread crumbs and fried. It did explain the thick armour of bread crumbs desecrating what used to be ground Alberta wagyu before it was submerged in a hot oil bath. Add that one to the inedible list.\n\nFinally, on Visit Six our table was attended by a server who knew her stuff \u2014 and what she didn't know, she found out before saying something untrue.\n\nWhat I do know is this: DOSC is a craft steak restaurant, cocktail bar and caf\u00e9 where the team's respect for quality food is displayed by focusing on the tip-to-tail philosophy using all parts of the animal. At least, that's what the website says.\n\nThey also promote their in-house butchery and dry-aging chamber for the high-end beef they bring in from Alberta, Idaho and Japan.\n\nBut sometimes you have to look beyond the buzzwords.\n\nKudos to DOSC for giving tip-to-tail a go, but truly abiding by this ideology takes more than ordering in boxes of meat and cutting the pieces into smaller pieces.\n\nDOSC does excel at cooking steak, and Edmonton could really use a decent steakhouse.\n\nThe 45-day, dry-aged Canadian T-bone is a very good deal at $36. Unlike many of the dishes elsewhere on the menu that have been fiddled with to infinity and beyond with seasonings and sauces, this steak is cooked as it should be: pan-roasted and seasoned with salt and pepper.\n\nThe accompanying sides also scored very well. Roasted Brussels sprouts, topped with crispy pancetta, egg white foam and cured egg yolk, were hearty and umami-packed; the butternut gnocchi was tender and flavourful.\n\nIf you've never had legitimate wagyu (a word that translates to Japanese cow) from Japan, then go to DOSC and order it.\n\nYou will pay dearly. Currently, a nine-ounce strip loin from the Iwate prefecture runs $95, but it is a beautiful, ultra-marbled, flavourful, melt-in-your mouth, piece of meat. It is graded A4 on the Japanese grading system \u2014 only A5 is higher.\n\nThe people behind DOSC invested about $1 million to renovate the historic Metals building space at 10190 104th St. About 125 seats are scattered throughout one of the city's most stunning restaurant spaces.

He said their contributions are sometimes forgotten and misunderstood.\n\nScott Sheffield is a history professor at the University of the Fraser Valley in Abbotsford, British Columbia.\n\nThe first question Sheffield is often asked about his work is why did Indigenous people choose to fight for a country that marginalized them? \"There isn't an easy or quick answer to that,\" he said. \"There were a lot of different reasons why people might choose to enlist.\"\n\n\"And just the fact that they were enlisting didn't necessarily signify that they were supportive of the governance system that oppressed them.\"\n\nFor over two decades, Scott Sheffield\u2019s work has focused on Indigenous peoples' participation in the Canadian military. (Kirsten Sheffield.) Sheffield explained that, for some, enlisting was part of fulfilling treaty obligations. For others, choosing to enlist was about patriotism, but not a conventional Canadian patriotism.\n\n\"They wanted to defend Canada, yes. But they also wanted to defend their own territories, their own communities, their own people.\"\n\nFighting in WWII, for some Indigenous soldiers, was a chance to follow in the footsteps of their fathers and uncles who had fought in World War I, and also of ancestors even further back who had achieved warrior status in their nations.\n\nEnlisting was political for some Indigenous soldiers too, Sheffield said. Sergeant Tommy Prince, he explained, was determined to prove that Indigenous people were \"as good as any white man.\" Prince was one of the most-decorated Indigenous war veterans in Canada, he was awarded a total of 11 medals in WWII and the Korean War.\n\nWhen that uniform came off they went from being a soldier to being, in the words of one veteran, 'just another Indian.'\n\nAlthough the participation of Indigenous peoples in Canadian war efforts is extensive, getting numbers can be tricky. \"The statistics were collected by Indian Affairs which wasn't always super diligent about that sort of thing,\" said Sheffield.\n\nIn World War I, Indian Affairs estimated that 4,000 First Nations men enlisted. These records are incomplete, he said, and don't include non-Status Indians and M\u00e9tis.\n\nFor World War II, the official number from Indian Affairs for First Nations enlistments was 3,090. \"The true number is closer to 4,300,\" Sheffield said.\n\nFighting overseas for freedom, coming home to inequality\n\nFor Indigenous peoples who fought in the military, many felt a sense of equality that they had never experienced in Canadian civilian society.\n\n\"From every story that I've heard, from every veteran that I've talked to, the experience in the military was one where they felt very much an equal to their comrades in arms,\" Sheffield explained.\n\n\"In a foxhole, if you had somebody who you trusted who had your back, you didn't care about anything else.\"\n\nThis experience of equality disappeared when Indigenous soldiers returned to Canada, Sheffield said.\n\n\"When that uniform came off they went from being a soldier to being, in the words of one veteran, 'just another Indian.'\"\n\nSheffield said Indigenous soldiers fought for a freedom, a democracy and an equality that they could never share, \"And that was particularly painful.\"\n\nPaying tribute to a lost history\n\nIndigenous veterans organizations have done a lot of work to restore the memories of Indigenous participation in the military, Sheffield said.\n\n\"They began to campaign for recognition of their contributions and their sacrifices. And that's really what began to bring this memory back to popular and political attention in Canada.\"\n\nActs of remembrance are important, he said. They pay tribute to a history that was lost for a long time.\n\n\"That they served alongside everybody else in the same way. That they sacrificed, that they suffered, that they died. On the behalf of a country that that didn't necessarily treat them very well.\"\n\nToday, there are acts of remembrance for Indigenous veterans all across Canada, at the national and regional level. Many Indigenous communities also have their own memorials and services.\n\nThere is more recognition and remembrance now, said Sheffield. \"Going forward, the challenge is going to be to sustain that.\"\n\nClick the Listen button above to hear more of Scott Sheffield's conversation with guest host Falen Johnson.", "A 24-year-old man from Upper LaHave, N.S., is facing a long list of charges after he allegedly stole a woman's car right in front of her, hit a vehicle with it and and then crashed the car \u2014 all while under the influence of a drug, police say.\n\nRCMP said the incident began on Friday just before noon when a 67-year-old woman was getting into her Honda Fit in the parking lot of a Yarmouth grocery store.\n\nA man approached her, yanked her out of the vehicle, threw her to the ground, grabbed her purse and cellphone and stole her car.\n\nWitnesses at the scene helped the woman and called 911, and paramedics arrived to tend to her cuts and bruises.\n\nMeanwhile, the man peeled out of the parking lot in the stolen car, hitting a vehicle on Starrs Road along the way.

Raise the Rates use that number to calculate challenge participants' weekly allowance.\n\nThey factor in the monthly minimum cost of personal hygiene (roughly $10), bus fare (roughly $28), a phone to look for a job (roughly $25) and rent. The average rent of a single room occupancy (SRO) hotel unit in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside is now $687 a month, said Gerlings. Last year, it was $548.\n\nThose high rents \u2014 just for a room in a hotel with a shared bathroom and no kitchen \u2014 is why the challenge was cancelled, she said. When you subtract $687 from $710, that leaves $23 for the whole month; divided by four, that's $5.75 a week.\n\n\"The rent has gone up significantly, and the rates have not gone up significantly to match that,\" said Gerlings.\n\n'The hardest hit'\n\nShe said there aren't enough regulations preventing landlords from raising the rent of vacant SRO units. And, though the B.C. New Democrats raised welfare rates by $100 after they took office in 2017, it's not enough, said Gerlings.\n\n\"Keep in mind that this is the first welfare raise in over a decade. That $100 was ten years in the making,\" she said.\n\n\"The affordability crisis is on everybody's minds, but people on welfare are truly the hardest hit,\" said Gerlings. \"There was no way that that $100 was going to stay in people's pockets.\"\n\nTo remedy the problem, Gerlings said there need to be aggressive rent controls to stop landlords from raising rents in between tenancies. There also needs to be a significant increase in income assistance, she said.\n\nWith files from On the Coast", "Dancer and choreographer Vasantha Krishnan giggled as she recounted how her mother said she was a nuisance as a small child.\n\nWhat mom found \"annoying\" \u2014 she probably meant \"hard to keep up with\" \u2014 was that her daughter was always moving... in fact, always dancing.\n\nThe giggles subdued as Krishnan recounted, with conviction, her mother's description of her 5-year-old self, growing up in their then-small village in Kerala State, South India: she would do a rhythmic movement on one side of her body and repeat the exact same one on the other side.\n\nSo what did mom decide to do? Get her expressive child into classical Indian dance.\n\nDancers trained in Baratanatyam rehearse a special choreography that looks at #MeToo stories in Hindu mythology. (Submitted by Nrityalaya Dance School)\n\n\"I had a great master, he would teach semi-classical dance, he would use poetry and make them into dramas. I really liked the way he was teaching,\" explained Krishnan, now a choreographer and teacher.\n\n\"When I joined his school, he taught me very quickly, then always took me out to perform.\"\n\nWhat she learned and practised as a dancer in the 1950s in southern India, she carried with her to Quebec when she immigrated in 1966, to eventually introduce to her own children, and those of others in Montreal.\n\nThis Sunday at Oscar Peterson Hall, past and present students of Krishnan's dance school, Nrithyalaya Dance School, will be presenting folkloric and classical Indian dances in a show they're calling Nrithyamala: Garland of Dances.\n\nThe school focuses primarily on the oldest of the art forms, Bharatanatyam, which dates back to 2nd century CE.\n\nThese dances combine very codified dance movements with music and theatre and are often considered worship dances, Krishnan explained. They tell stories of Hindu mythology and, most of the time, interpret it to the letter.\n\nBut on Sunday, Krishnan is going deeper with her reading of her community's doctrine to present original choreography: unique work she believes may garner negative reaction from people of her cultural and religious community.\n\nInspired by current events\n\nLike any artist, Krishnan draws inspiration from issues, events happening in her day to day, conversations in the news or sometimes a lyric from one of the traditional songs.\n\nFifteen years ago, she was drawn by this Tamil lyric: \"Remove the misery.\" She used it to choreograph a work that showed audiences how children were lured into becoming suicide bombers; a weeping mother over the dead body of her child was the final scene, to emphasize the point.\n\nThe piece was her commentary about the war in Sri Lanka.\n\nKrishnan is calling her newest work Adharma, a Sanskrit word that loosely translate to injustice, raising the point that the abuse of women at the hands of men, very powerful and revered men, has been around since before even the birth of Christ.\n\nAdharma makes the point that the abuse of women at the hands of men, very powerful and revered men, has been around since before even the birth of Christ. (Courtesy Nrithyalaya Dance School)\n\n\"The #MeToo movement is in the news everyday, stories with people who are high-profiled. I'm glad that the women who suffered, are coming forward and addressing it,\" she started.\n\n\"In our mythology, the epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata, there are women who went through this kind of treatment. These issues are there but no one would address it in such a way.\"\n\nThrough the elegant and percussive movements of Bharatanatyam, a group of her students will be illustrating three Hindu epics to show how women in the mythology were abused by powerful men.\n\nWomen such as Seeta, the wife of Lord Rama \u2014 who is considered to be God. Seeta was abducted by Ravana, a powerful being often portrayed as a demon god.\n\nShe lived under a tree for a year, never once looking at Ravana.\n\nEventually, her husband kills Ravana in a battle. But before bringing Seetha back home, he asks her to enter a fire to prove her purity.\n\nIndian classical dances go back centuries. For 42 years now, one school in Montreal has been committed to keeping this dance tradition alive. We talk to founder and choreographer, Vasantha Krishnan...and her daughter and dancer Sudha Krishnan. 54:00\n\nAn important conversation\n\nSpandana Veeravalli, 19, started studying classical Indian dance as a young child before emigrating from India to Canada.\n\nShe said she is excited to perform the piece, and doesn't think she's seen anything inspired by the #MeToo movement in the classical dance community before.\n\n\"For my teacher to say that this was going to be related to the #MeToo movement, I had never thought of that aspect, but once she started explaining, it started falling into place.\"\n\nThe McGill pre-med student values her current teacher's knowledge of the artforms, but also her innovation and courage.\n\nSpandana Veeravalli, right, rehearses the Adharma choreography with a partner. The 19-year-old says she's excited to perform the piece.

Yet some of those implicated in the killing are close to the crown prince, including a member of the prince's entourage on foreign trips who was seen at the consulate before Khashoggi's slaying.\n\nErdogan accused Saudi Arabia's chief prosecutor, who was sent to Istanbul last month as part of a joint probe, of employing \"delaying tactics.\"\n\n\"Saudi Arabia needs to accept that [the killer] is among the 18 and needs to get rid of the suspicion by responding to Turkey's good will and acting fairly,\" Erdogan said.", "For Justin Trudeau and his Canadian delegation, there was an obvious place to start a weekend of commemorations marking the centenary of the armistice that ended the First World War: The still-pockmarked battlefield at Canada's National Memorial at Vimy Ridge.\n\nDreary, damp skies and a chilling wind greeted the prime minister when he arrived off his overnight flight from Ottawa Saturday morning. But just as it was a century ago, Vimy Ridge remains a place for stoicism and national pride.\n\n\"You stand for the values upon which Canada was built, values like democracy, equality, justice and liberty. And what I can barely know, you will never forget,\" Trudeau told a half-dozen representatives of veterans' organizations following a wreath laying in the small cemetery on the memorial's grounds.\n\n\"From the very bottom of our hearts, thank you.\"\n\nIt falls to subsequent generations of veterans to tell the story of Vimy Ridge today \u2014 the place where Canadian soldiers forged a national identity by fighting together for the first time under their own command.\n\nThe words now inscribed on the massive hilltop monument describe their accomplishment in a succinct, understated style: \"The Canadian Corps on the 9th of April, 1917, with four divisions in line on a front of four miles, attacked and captured this ridge.\"\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau, O'Regan and Canada's ambassador to France, Isabelle Hudon, met representatives from veterans' organizations and young people who won an essay competition during their visit to the Vimy Memorial on Saturday. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)\n\nCanada's ambassador to France, Isabelle Hudon, said it's important to keep the memory of a \"generation of extraordinary citizens\" alive, honouring the sacrifices made both on the battlefield and at home.\n\n\"These brave men and women have always stood up for Canada,\" she said. \"Now it is our turn to stand up for them.\"\n\nVeterans Affairs Minister Seamus O'Regan called the battle at Vimy, about two hours north of Paris near the city of Arras, the \"battle that helped end the war,\" after months of devastating and brutal trench warfare against the Germans.\n\n\"The price, though, was staggering,\" he said, metres away from grave markers of young Canadian soldiers, some of whose remains were buried unidentified.\n\nValues forged in battle\n\nIn his speech to the small gathering of a few dozen dignitaries and invited guests, O'Regan said reading the letters of First World War soldiers is a reminder of what they sacrificed \"greatly and knowingly\" to help build a better future for their young country.\n\n\"Now we are free to choose our country's course,\" the minister said, drawing a straight line from the values that propelled the soldiers a century ago to the freedoms Canadians enjoy today.\n\n\"We must remember the lesson of these conflicts: That freedom is not free. That it is not easy. Indeed it is hard fought,\" the minister said. \"To remember those lessons is to remember those who fought these battles and who fight them still.\"\n\nO'Regan and Hudon joined Trudeau for a short Indigenous ceremony during their wreath laying. First Nations and M\u00e9\u200btis veterans were among the half-dozen who met the prime minister and attended a short reception with the dignitaries following the prime minister's visit.\n\n(CBC)\n\nKeith Williamson described how he believes he's the third generation to serve. He spent about 25 years in the reserves and regular forces, his father fought in the Second World War, and he believes a grandfather he never met fought with the Royal Navy in the First World War.\n\nHe said it was an honour to be part of the armistice event at Vimy.\n\n\"It was the first major battle that Canada was in,\" he said. \"We had a tremendous loss of life ... Canada became a country, as it were.\"\n\nA small group of young people were also included in Saturday's commemoration.\n\nPascal Morimanno, 16, was chosen to attend after telling his family's story in an essay competition. His great-grandfather fought for the British side in the final 100 days leading up to the armistice, including at the Battle of the Somme.\n\nHe told reporters it wasn't lost on him that some of the grave markers at Vimy remember soldiers nearly as young as him when they were killed on that Easter Monday in 1917.\n\nVimy Oaks now planted on site\n\nOn his way from the cemetery up to the hilltop monument, Trudeau stopped at a small grove of oak saplings, part of recent efforts to replace the original oak trees on the battlefield site with young trees originating in Canada.\n\nIn the battle's aftermath, Canadian soldier Leslie Miller plucked a handful of acorns and sent them home to Toronto, where they grew into strong trees. Now volunteers are using the Canadian trees to regenerate the trees on the memorial grounds in France.\n\nThere are now 100 saplings for the 1.6-hectare park, to coincide with the centenary. They're planted in four concentric rings, one for each of the Canadian divisions that fought the famous battle.\n\nAtop the ridge, the Canadian Armed Forces combined pipes and drums band played as Trudeau walked past the thousands of names of Canada's First World War dead. The rain held off as a soloist sang O Canada and La Marseillaise, the French national anthem.\n\nThen it was off to Paris for the prime minister and other dignitaries representing Canada at the international commemoration set to take over the heart of the city on Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the armistice agreement that ended the war.\n\nSaturday evening, French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting a private tour and dinner at the Mus\u00e9\u200be d'Orsay for some of the 60 world leaders expected to be in attendance, representing countries that fought on both sides of what was supposed to be the war to end all wars.", "This week, 94-old-old Eva Olsson was at an Edmonton school where she talked about her time in a concentration camp.

Every time she speaks, she says, brings back the trauma she lived through during the Holocaust.\n\nGrade 9 student Mateo Tellez called Olsson's presentation an emotional experience.\n\n\"One part that really got to me was ... her mother, the last time she had seen her. The fact that she had so many regrets, she wanted to say sorry one last time before seeing her,\" Tellez said.\n\n\"The thought of one day, seeing my mother one last time and not being able to tell her all the things I've ever wanted to tell her, it's horrifying. It's terrible.\"\n\nOlsson is introduced to the student and staff at Steele Heights school last Wednesday.\n\nIn her speech, Olsson speaks passionately about what happens when hate goes unchecked and she encourages her young audiences to remember the importance of respect and acceptance.\n\nThat message made Grade 9 student Emma Cardinal consider how words can be weapons, especially in today's world of social media and online interactions.\n\n\"I don't think that any of us truly understand the word hate, or understand the meaning or the possibilities of what it could mean to someone else,\" Cardinal said.\n\n\"We should all accept each other.

Their stories are told at the Tenement Museum in New York City.\n\nKevin Jennings, the museum's president, likens the experiences of immigrants in the 20th century to those of the thousands of people currently making their way to the U.S.-Mexico border in what's being called the migrant caravan.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday invoked extraordinary national security powers to deny asylum for migrants who enter the country illegally as the caravans approach the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAs criticism and attacks on the caravan continue, including fake stories about how the caravan is funded or alleging that it will bring diseases \u2014 and even bombs \u2014 into the U.S., Jennings tells Day 6 host Brent Bambury that he sees echoes of past stories in the caravan of today.\n\nHere is part of their conversation:\n\nYou've been following the personal stories of some of the people in this caravan. What are the parallels that you see between their stories, and the stories that are told in the Tenement Museum?\n\nWhat we tell here at the Tenement Museum are the real stories of people who immigrated to the United States beginning in the 1860s and ending in the 1960s. And a lot of these folks came out of desperation.\n\nThey came because the countries they were coming from were poor, they were war torn, there was political turmoil and they were engaging in very dangerous journeys to come here.\n\nA view of Orchard Street, an area lined with low-rise tenements, on Manhattan's Lower East Side circa 1915. (Museum of the City of New York)\n\nIn the case of the Irish, about one in 10 people coming to the country died in the so-called coffin ships that brought them across.\n\nSo, when we look at the journeys of people coming from Central America they're coming from poor countries with tremendous amounts of political turmoil.\n\nThey're engaging in an incredibly dangerous journey on foot across Mexico, across deserts, across mountains. And in some ways it is very reminiscent of what previous groups of immigrants have had to do to get to America before.\n\nSo, people coming to America, fleeing persecution, looking for a better life \u2014 this is part of the American story. Why do you think the caravan of today is so controversial?\n\nI think, first of all, we have to look to our leaders for how they are leading at this time.\n\nThey could either welcome people who are different than ourselves or they could tell us to be afraid of people who are different than ourselves, and the message we're getting from some of our leaders is to be afraid. And if you stoke people's fears you shouldn't be surprised when they react with fear.\n\nI think, secondly ... often in previous era's immigrants have been portrayed as threats to America. And that's what's happening once again with these caravans.\n\nRather than understand them as being much like immigrants who came before \u2014 people seeking better lives and fleeing places where it's very difficult to live \u2014 they're being portrayed as people who are coming here to somehow do us harm.\n\nA view of Orchard Street circa 1898. (Museum of the City of New York via Tenement Museum)\n\nI don't think that's the case. I think that immigrants of yesteryear and immigrants of today are very similar. There are people who simply want to create better lives for their families and are trying to get out of a bad situation to a better one.\n\nAnd if we were to look at today's caravans within the context of the people who came in the past, we'd find that they're really not so different than our own ancestors.\n\nBut historically, did those waves of earlier immigrants face similar fear mongering as what you describe is happening today?\n\nAbsolutely. The Irish who came in the 1800s were greeted with 'No Irish Need Apply' signs. In 1882, the federal government enacted the so-called Chinese Exclusion Act which specifically forbade further immigration of Chinese people to America.\n\nIn 1924, the federal government enacted the National Origins Act which set quotas for Italians and Eastern Europeans so that they could exclude largely Jewish immigrants.\n\nAmerica has always had a love-hate relationship with immigration. On the one hand, we have the Statue of Liberty telling us that we welcome the poor, the tired, the huddled masses. On the other hand we have a long tradition of prejudice and laws designed to keep immigrants out.\n\nAnd propaganda, I think, against waves of immigration as well. When you hear Fox News commentators talking about the caravan bringing disease to the U.S., is there an historical precedent for that kind of propaganda? There's no factual basis for that. This is propaganda.\n\nAbsolutely. Whether you take the Irish in the 1800s, or the Chinese in the late 19th century, or Jews and Italians [in] the early 20th century, the same types of arguments are always made against them.\n\nThey are speaking unfamiliar languages, they're practicing unfamiliar religions, they come from different racial and cultural backgrounds than us and they're going to somehow do damage to our country.\n\nI'm sorry to say that many of our leaders right now seem to be on the 'fear and loathing' end of the spectrum. - Kevin Jennings, The Tenement Museum\n\nSo, the names of the villains change from the Irish to the Chinese to the Jews to the Italians to the Central Americans, but the arguments are always the same.\n\nAnd one thing the history proves is that none of those things turned out ever to be true; that these folks end up becoming good loyal Americans who contributed enormously to our society.\n\nOur society wouldn't be what it is today without the contributions of these waves and waves of immigrants. So, the idea that somehow these folks are coming here to do us harm ignores the historical fact that immigrants have helped build this country.\n\nBut a lot of people are willing to ignore those facts. You wrote an op-ed in The New York Daily News asking people to consider how desperate these refugees are. Who are you trying to reach? Why did you feel compelled to write that?\n\nI think that somehow people view today's refugees as different than refugees of previous generations, whereas in reality I don't think they are.\n\nMy ancestors came from Canada. They were French-Canadians who were seeking better jobs in the United States in the late 19th century. They just wanted to create better lives for themselves than was available to them in Quebec at the time.\n\nThe Tenement Museum shares the stories and history of immigrants to the United States throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. (Submitted by Tenement Museum)\n\nI don't think that the Central Americans coming to America today in the 21st century are any different than my French-Canadian ancestors who came in the late 19th century. What they have in common is they were trying to find a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nThat to me is a universal human urge and we should recognize that human beings \u2014 there may be differences among us \u2014 but at the end we all want the same thing. which is to provide a good life for ourselves and our families.\n\nAnd regardless of what time period, or what background people come from, that story is always the same.\n\nAre you hopeful about the way people will view immigration going forward? Do you think we're living in a dark time or do you think that this is historically like any other time?\n\nI think this all comes down to a question of leadership. Our leaders can either encourage acceptance and appreciation of difference, or they can encourage fear and loathing of people who are different.\n\nI'm sorry to say that many of our leaders right now seem to be on the fear and loathing end of the spectrum. And I'm hopeful that we can see some leadership that shows real leadership which would be embracing of different and teaching people to be afraid of it.\n\nThis transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

(The Dabber Hashery/Facebook)\n\nThe inspectors were pointing at a sign inside the store, as well the T-shirt a cashier was wearing, which had the words \"speciality cannabis supplies\" written on it, Keefe said.\n\n\"We asked them to explain why can't we do this ... and they just said, 're-read the federal and provincial legislation.'\"\n\nThe legislation the inspectors were referring to is the Cannabis Act, and what it says about promoting cannabis and cannabis accessories is \"very confusing,\" according to St. John's criminal lawyer Mark Gruchy.\n\nNobody really seems to be able to identify specifically what part of the laws were violated. - Jon Keefe, co-owner of Dabber Hashery\n\nGruchy, a criminal defence lawyer at Gittens & Associates, says he couldn't find anything in the act that forbids the use of the word \"cannabis\" in accessory shops.\n\nBut he says the act has provisions around the presence of minors in spaces where cannabis accessories are being promoted, and that could leave head shops in a legal quagmire.\n\n\"If you have a scenario where there's a defined reason why young people aren't admitted in a place by law, such as a bar, that would work,\" Gruchy told Day 6 host Brent Bambury.\n\n\"But if you're just talking about a shop, you get into the question of what does 'young persons are not permitted by law' mean?\"\n\nCriminal defence attorney Mark Gruchy says the Cannabis Act's provision around advertising leaves a lot to individual regulators' interpretation. (Submitted/David Hebbard)\n\nIt is unclear if posting a sign that says \"no minors allowed\" outside a store would be enough to avoid the ire of regulators, says Gruchy.\n\nIt is unlikely the federal government intended for the act to be interpreted as aggressively as Newfoundland's regulators read it in this case, he also says.\n\nIf the act is read so strictly, selling a coffee table book about growing cannabis could also carry legal risks, says Gruchy.\n\n\"You're leaving an awful lot in the hands of enforcement [agents] to try to interpret this piece of legislation, which is not, in my view, very well-written,\" Gruchy added.\n\nSimilar to tobacco laws\n\nGruchy says when it comes to advertising, the Cannabis Act is much the same as the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act, except for one key difference.\n\nWhile the law around promoting tobacco specially targets the tobacco industry, the Cannabis Act seems to catch anyone who is selling cannabis or cannabis accessories.\n\nThis means the marijuana subculture, which existed long before pot became legal, could be in trouble.\n\nJon Keefe, the owner of the Dabber Hashery in downtown St. John's, says he hasn't been able to get a clear answer on how his store may have breached the federal cannabis law. (Jon Keefe/Facebook)\n\nAnother quirk about the cannabis law, Gruchy says, is that it only applies to those who are selling cannabis accessories, but not those are who making them for their own use.\n\nKeefe said that since the inspectors' visit to his shop he hasn't been able to get a straight answer as to what exactly his store had done wrong.\n\n\"We tried to follow up at the liquor corporation to get some answers, but nobody has been really very forthcoming. Nobody really seems to be able to identify specifically what part of the laws were violated,\" he said.\n\n'Fresh situation'\n\nThe NCL did not respond to a request for comment from Day 6.\n\nGruchy isn't surprised Keefe hasn't gotten all the answers yet.\n\n\"I think that he can't get a straight answer because maybe [the NCL] themselves are not entirely sure what they're doing,\" he said.\n\n\"This is a pretty fresh situation.\"\n\nGruchy added that the federal government could amend the legislation with clarifications, or add another regulation that explains the rules around the presence of minors in details.\n\n\"Right now, there's an awful lot of confusion.\"\n\nTo hear more from Jon Keefe and Mark Gruchy, download our podcast or click the 'Listen' button at the top of this page.", "This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning.

Who do I listen to? Who do I send my patients to, because I know I do not have adequate knowledge?\"\n\nWho should train doctors on prescribing medical cannabis?\n\nBut Toronto family doctor Sharon Cirone questions whether this medical education should be offered by a drug store chain that wants to get into the business of selling medical cannabis.\n\n\"It's not appropriate and it's not necessary,\" she said, adding that there are resources being developed by the College of Family Physicians of Canada and other medical associations that don't have a vested financial interest in cannabis.\n\nThe issue brings into sharp focus two increasingly controversial questions \u2014 how should a product that has not been approved through the normal drug approval process be used in medical practice? And who should be selling it?\n\nCanada has two separate cannabis markets\u2014 recreational and medical. (CBC)\n\nRight now, pharmacies are not allowed to dispense medical cannabis. Instead patients must get it through the mail, after first getting authorization from a doctor and then registering with a licensed producer.\n\n(Last week CBC News reported that medical cannabis users are facing supply disruptions in the first rush to supply newly legalized recreational market.)\n\nNational pharmacy chains are lobbying for legislation that would let them sell medical cannabis.\n\n\"This is basically the only product for medicinal purposes that does not go through a pharmacy,\" said Justin Bates, CEO of the Neighbourhood Pharmacy Association of Canada which represents major drugstore chains and large retailers with in-store pharmacies.\n\nThe Canadian Pharmacists Association (CPhA) said patients would be better served if pharmacists were the ones dispensing medical cannabis.\n\n\"Typically the patients who are using cannabis for medical purposes are not using it as first line,\" said CPhA spokesperson Shelita Dattani. \"They're on other medications which may have drug interactions with cannabis, they may be experiencing adverse effects, and we'd like to make sure we're helping to keep patients safe.\"\n\nLack of evidence still a concern, says CMA\n\nBut the professional pharmacist licensing agencies are not as keen for their pharmacists to jump into the medical cannabis field. The National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Associations outlines that hesitation in a position statement.\n\nThere is similar hesitation from the Canadian Medical Association about doctors embracing cannabis use in their practices.\n\n\"The CMA remains concerned about the lack of clinical research, guidance and regulatory oversight for cannabis as a potential medical intervention,\" the CMA states on its website.\n\n\"Physicians [are] being asked to prescribe something that is not approved, and that is largely ingested by smoking,\" said Cirone. \"Physicians have never been put in the position to prescribe a smoked product before and expose the lungs to disease.\"\n\nRight now, some doctors avoid dealing with the problem and instead direct patients to the recreational cannabis market, even though medical users might have different medical cannabis needs, such as achieving pain relief without getting high.\n\nIs there a conflict of interest?\n\n\"Now with it being legal, many patients are going forward and getting a product and asking afterwards for guidance on how to use it,\" said Winnipeg oncologist Dr. Paul Daeninck. He routinely gives talks to doctors about his experience using cannabis to treat cancer pain and other palliative conditions. He's one of the panellists involved in the Shoppers Drug Mart seminars.\n\nIs there a potential conflict of interest?\n\n\"I feel that a company or a group that's providing education and trying to do it in an unbiased manner is really doing the right thing, and bringing in experts to talk about it is important,\" Daeninck said.\n\nThis is the first step in our journey to provide medical cannabis to our patients,\" - Catherine Thomas, Loblaw Companies Limited\n\n\"The sessions, developed and presented by key opinion leaders from top Canadian universities and hospitals, cover the most up-to-date information about research into medical cannabis, including its use for a variety of disease states,\" said Catherine Thomas, spokesperson for Loblaw Companies Limited, which owns the Shoppers Drug Mart chain.\n\nIn September, Shoppers Drug Mart received a licence from Health Canada to purchase and store pre-packaged cannabis products from existing licensed producers.\n\n\"This is the first step in our journey to provide medical cannabis to our patients,\" Thomas said in an email.\n\nHealth Canada confirmed that Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacies cannot sell cannabis even through the mail, until the company receives a second Health Canada licence.\n\n\"There is no licence under the Cannabis Regulations that would allow Shoppers Drug Mart, or its subsidiary companies, to sell cannabis in its stores,\" Health Canada spokesperson Tammy Jarbeau said in an email.\n\nWith files from Manjula Defresne in Vancouver.", "Lori Nikkel first discovered how much food gets wasted in Canada when she was a single mother to three hungry boys in the Toronto suburb of Etobicoke.\n\nNikkel and a group of other low-income mothers had convinced their local Loblaws grocery store to donate food to their children's school for a student nutrition program.\n\nOften, Nikkel found out, the store was overstocked because it ordered too much of certain items. The excess food went to Nikkel and the school \u2014 otherwise, it would have gone to waste.\n\n\"I remember once getting 500 pineapples,\" Nikkel said. \"It was great.\"\n\nNikkel is now the CEO of Toronto-based charity Second Harvest, which connects suppliers and distributors with non-profit organizations across Ontario to distribute excess food so it doesn't end up in landfills. This week she was on a panel at the Zero Waste Conference in Vancouver.\n\nThe Toronto charity Second Harvest collects excess food that would otherwise go to waste and delivers it to non-profit organizations across Ontario. (Second Harvest)\n\nCanada wastes an estimated $31 billion worth of food each year \u2014 about 40 per cent of all the food produced. More than half of that occurs before it gets to the dinner table, when it's discarded by farmers, food manufacturers and distributors.\n\nNikkel says food gets wasted across the supply chain, from farmers who can't sell blemished apples to manufacturers that slightly mess up a batch of bread, to grocery stores that end up with too many items about to reach their best-before date.\n\n\"People just consider it the cost of doing business,\" she said. \u200b\"Where food is getting made, there is loss across the chain.\"\n\nFood waste has become a salient topic, not only because edible food gets tossed out while millions of people go hungry. Organic waste also produces methane when it decomposes in landfills, making it one of the biggest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nBut people like Nikkel are trying to change that. And businesses that want to root out inefficiencies to protect their bottom line are listening.\n\nOverproduction of food\n\nSecond Harvest collects food that would otherwise go to waste and delivers it to more than 300 non-profit organization across Ontario. The organization focuses on fresh food, like produce, meat and dairy.\n\n\"There is an overproduction of food globally and it actually leapfrogs over people and goes into landfills, creating a huge environmental challenge,\" she said during a lunch break at the conference on Thursday.\n\nOther groups at the conference dedicated to preventing waste included Vancouver-based tech start-up FoodMesh, which also connects surplus foods to charities, and Provision Coalition, which works directly with food and drink manufacturers to help them become more efficient.\n\nOne of the other people on the panel with Nikkel was Sam Wankowski, Walmart Canada's senior vice-president of operations for Western Canada.\n\nLast April, Walmart committed to have zero food waste across its organization by 2025.\n\n\"It just makes good business sense,\" Wankowski said. \"If we can ... improve the efficiencies of our processes and our infrastructure, that just increases value for everyone.\"\n\n'We can do a lot more'\n\nWalmart came under a lot of criticism in 2016, when a CBC Marketplace investigation found garbage bins full of produce, bottled water, frozen foods, meat and dairy products that appeared to still be fresh and safe for consumption.\n\nBut Wankowski says the company's new policy didn't stem from that criticism. He says Walmart's food waste reduction initiatives were already underway by then, and the company has decreased food waste by 23 per cent over the last few years.\n\n\"We know we can do better and we can do a lot more,\" he said.\n\nBins full of food behind a Toronto-area Walmart store in 2016. Walmart says it has improved store processes and employee training to keep food out of the bins. (CBC)\n\nWalmart has implemented several tactics to decrease food waste, Wankowski said. First and foremost it's trying to sell the food it carries \u2014 this means more precise tools to forecast demand so it can order accordingly \u2014 and dropping the prices of soon-to-be expired items.\n\nAnd through its philanthropic arm, the Walmart Foundation, the company is giving away $19 million to organizations that help reduce food waste in Canada.\n\n'There's good food out there'\n\nSome critics say that diverting excess food that would otherwise end up in landfills or elsewhere won't solve world hunger.\n\nUniversity of British Columbia professor emeritus Graham Riches explores that issue in his new book, Food Bank Nations: Poverty, Corporate Capture and the Right to Food. He argues that the best way to help people who need access to food is to give them a living wage so they can afford it, instead of receiving charity.\n\nMore than half of Canada's food waste comes from the supply chain. The remaining 47 per cent is wasted by households.\n\nNikkel\u200b agrees that a lack of adequate income is one of the main drivers of hunger, but she says there's work to be done until then.\n\nShe adds that the food she distributes doesn't need to just go to those in need \u2014 it's simply surplus food that shouldn't be wasted.\n\n\"This doesn't necessarily have to be about low income,\" she said. \"There's good food out there, why aren't we eating it?\"\n\n\n\n", "Ontario's government-run online cannabis retailer, already facing many complaints in the weeks since legalization, has blamed producers licensed by Health Canada for what it calls a labelling mix-up that delayed delivery of some products.\n\nIn an email to affected customers this week, Patrick Ford, the chief executive officer of the Ontario Cannabis Store said the province's only legal outlet for recreational pot, had put in place unspecified measures to prevent a recurrence. Ford also promised packages would leave the store's distribution centre on the weekend.\n\n\"The OCS sincerely apologizes for how long you have had to wait for your order,\" Ford said in the email. \"As a small gesture of our appreciation for your patience we are providing you with a refund of the $5 shipping fee you paid.\"\n\nAccording to the email, the promised shipping refund applies only to people who ordered affected products from the online store on Oct. 17 \u2014 the day recreational pot became legal in Canada \u2014 or Oct. 18, but not to those who ordered in the ensuing days, had their payments accepted, but also didn't receive their purchased product because of the mix-up.\n\nCannabis buds sit in a drying rack in this photo.

He would also not say how many customers were impacted, what the mistake was costing the government-run agency, or what measures had been put in place to ensure the problem did not happen again.\n\n\"We have nothing further to add,\" said Amanda Winton, communications manager for the cannabis store.\n\nWhen pressed for details, Winton simply repeated the information Ford had put in the email to customers.\n\n\"Some of the items we received from Health Canada-authorized licensed producers (LPs) were mislabelled, and this delayed our ability to process and ship these items to some of our customers, including those who ordered on the first day of legalization,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\n\"The OCS has worked with LPs to address these issues, and has also made changes to increase efficiency and expand capacity in order to meet demand and to fulfil orders that were affected by the labelling issues.\"\n\nProduct on pallets are pictured at the Ontario Cannabis Store distribution centre.

Those complaints, Dube said, involved delayed deliveries, poor communication with customers and billing problems.\n\nAdding to the store's woes have been rotating strikes at Canada Post, the company the cannabis retailer is using to get packages to customers. Ontario residents will be able to buy their weed from private brick-and-mortar outlets starting in April, the government has promised.\n\nThe cannabis store had previously warned that delivery times for orders may be longer than expected due to \"unbelievably high demand\" for pot and the labour action at Canada Post.", "Canada's Kirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Marinaro fell just short of the podium in the pairs competition at the NHK Trophy on Saturday.\n\nThe Canadians sat in podium position following the short program but slipped to fourth as their total score of 189.66 was less than a point short of securing a medal.\n\nKurt Browning, Pj Kwong, and Carol Lane discuss the 2018 NHK Trophy:\n\nCBC Sports' Kurt Browning, Pj Kwong, and Carol Lane discuss the 2018 NHK Trophy. 17:06\n\nIt was the fourth competition in seven weeks for Moore-Towers, of St. Catharines, Ont., and Marinaro, of Sarnia, Ont.

It also announced it will sell its Q Series turboprop aircraft program to Longview Aviation Capital for $300 million.\n\nThe job cuts come come after hefty public investments by the federal and Quebec governments, and backlash over executive bonuses.\n\nThe NDP's parliamentary leader and Quebec MP Guy Caron says he's frustrated and something needs to change when it comes to the government lending money to Bombardier and other companies.\n\n\"From time to time, there might be a justification to actually help companies, especially in a sector as important as aeronautics,\" he told host Chris Hall.\n\n\"The problem is when you're not attaching any conditions in terms of job protection. If you're lending money, you want to have some guarantees that it will stay in the country, that it will help workers in the country.\"\n\nThe Montreal-based company announced it will sell its Q Series turboprop aircraft program to Longview Aviation Capital for $300 million. 2:22\n\nLast year, the federal government announced $372.5 million in interest-free loans to Bombardier. The year before, the company received a $1.2 billion investment for the CSeries passenger jet program from the Quebec government in exchange for a 49.5-per-cent stake.\n\nCaron says at this point, there's little the government can do about Bombardier, but there are steps he wants to see set up for the future.\n\n\"What I want government to do is actually develop a process, because this isn't the first time the government lends or gives subsidies to a company,\" he said.\n\n\"But we need a transparent process in which we can understand why it is doing so, and what is expected.\"\n\nAs for Bombardier itself, Caron called the company's decision to cut jobs \"a stain on Bombardier's reputation.\"\n\n\"When the government lends you money, it's your responsibility to spend it well,\" he said.\n\nThe Quebec MP reacts to Bombardier's job cuts. 6:16\n\nIn House panel: Recapping the week in politics\n\nConservative MP Tony Clement's sexting scandal is raising questions about extortion and national security. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nEven though it was a shorter-than-normal week in the House of Commons, it was a busy one. From an announcement that Bombardier would slice jobs to a sexting scandal involving an MP, there was a lot to digest.\n\nWe convened a special panel to revisit some of the big moments of the week \u2014 and shed some light on upcoming events.\n\nVassy Kapelos is the host of CBC's Power and Politics and Joel-Denis Bellavance is the Parliamentary bureau chief for La Presse.\n\nOn Bombardier\n\nWhat are the political implications, in Quebec particularly?\n\nJB: I think in the future, any government that will be asked to put any money into Bombardier will be taking a second, third, or fourth look and be very cautious.\n\nDid the feds get the right conditions on the loans they provided?\n\nVK: I'd have to know what the conditions are and they won't reveal them, and neither will the previous government. There is no real transparency around what kind of conditions are attached to federal money, whether it comes in the form of a bailout or in the form of a loan. And I think that's a big problem going forward for any kind of government money going out the door. And I think the optics of it aren't sitting well with Canadians.\n\nOn Conservative MP Tony Clement's sexting scandal\n\nDo you sense this is the last of the story?\n\nJB: No, I wouldn't be surprised if the pictures and video surface at some point in the future. His political career in Ottawa I think is over. I don't think Mr Clement can recover politically from this, because it was a big lapse of judgment to say the least.\n\nDo you think he will be forced to resign?\n\nB: Maybe not forced to, but I think he will come to the conclusion it's the only way out of this embarrassing situation. What you do on social media is part of political life now.\n\nHow do you think it was handled by the party?\n\nVK: If there is this sort of more common knowledge and the Conservatives would have been made aware of it, there could have been action earlier. What's really crucial about this is the security angle to this. If he didn't disclose something he should have, it becomes a bigger story than just about one man's personal misgivings.\n\nOn the fall fiscal update coming Nov. 21\n\nWhat are you looking for in the update?\n\nVK: I'm guessing we'll see capital cost allowances. I don't think they're going to cut corporate taxes but I do think there will be some kind of response to what's happening south of the border. I'm also looking to see whether they come up with a timeline for getting rid of the deficit.\n\nJB: I think the fiscal update will focus more on the finance minister's relations hip with corporate Canada. That's the key thing that the government wants to focus on, so when it comes around the next budget, they will focus again on the middle class.\n\nAnswers have been edited for length and clarity.", "The high rates of tuberculosis in Nunavut is something two Montreal women were ashamed to only recently learn about, despite their years of global work combating the infectious disease.\n\n\"We couldn't just sit at home and do nothing,\" said Rachel Kiddell-Monroe, general director of the non-profit See Change Initiative.\n\nShe has years of experience working with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, while Madlen Nash has worked abroad on TB in India and South Africa for the past three years. Together, they launched the non-profit, which had its first fundraising event in Montreal on Thursday.\n\n\"We're ashamed as Canadians that this is happening in our own country and feel that there is something we can do to contribute to ending TB in the north forever, and also contributing to reducing other health inequities that exist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians,\" said Nash.\n\nAccording to a report released earlier this year from the Public Health Agency of Canada, TB rates are almost 300 times higher among Inuit than for the non-Indigenous Canadian-born population.\n\nTaking the 'bottom up' approach\n\nThe two women hope that number will drastically go down in the coming years with a partnership with Ilisaqsivik Society in Clyde River, Nunavut, to develop a \"bottom-up\" approach to tackle the TB crisis.\n\nJoavee Etuangat is the chairman of the board of directors at Ilisaqsivik and knows first hand the impacts of TB on his community. His mother died in a building where TB patients were held.\n\n\"TB cases were an epidemic in our area at one point and it was eradicated but now it seems to be coming back. It is very important that we know what TB is and how to prevent it,\" he said in Inuktitut via video message to attendees at the fundraiser.\n\nAnnie Ittoshat, an Inuk community minister of the Diocese of the Arctic, opened Thursday\u2019s launch with a prayer. (Jessica Deer/CBC)\n\nThe goal is to create a community public health aide training lab to support prevention, diagnosis and treatment of TB through a task-sharing model that seeks to empower community members to take ownership over the delivery of health care.\n\n\"The critical point of it is that the communities are at the heart of it,\" said Nash.\n\n\"To merge southern knowledge with Inuit traditional knowledge and ways of learning, trying to create a program that is completely run in Inuktitut and run by Inuit.\"\n\nAn exciting shift\n\nShifting from a 'top down' model of care that relies heavily on nurses from the south to a 'bottom-up' community-based model of care is something exciting for Ilisaqsivik executive director Malcolm Ranta.\n\n\"Communities in Nunavut are traditionally staffed by nurses form the south. There's lots of turnover, gaps and vacancies that makes it difficult for continuity of care,\" he said.\n\n\"Having a model that can train and empower community members to be involved in the health-care system and the delivery of health is going to be a huge benefit. We look forward to moving forward with the project and seeing those benefits.\"", "Two New Brunswickers who were born the same year the First World War ended will take part in a Remembrance Day ceremony at Harbour Station.\n\nGeorge Kelley, who served in the Second World War, will be the reviewing officer. He'll be joined by Mary Richards, a former nurse who treated soldiers from both world wars.\n\nBernard Cormier, chair of the Saint John Remembrance Day ceremony and master of ceremonies, decided to ask the two local centenarians to participate because of the 100th anniversary of the armistice.\n\n\"I wanted to figure out how we could add some touches to this year's event that would recognize and mark the anniversary of the First World War,\" he said.\n\nThe highest honour a veteran can receive, according to Cormier, is being a reviewing officer.\n\nAir Force mechanic\n\nKelley will lay a wreath at the ceremony on Sunday, something he said he never expected to be asked to do.\n\nGeorge Kelley was born in 1918 and served in the Second World War.

Entire neighbourhoods were levelled by a blaze that threatened to explode again with the same fury that largely incinerated the foothill town.\n\nThe death toll in the wildfire that tore through the Northern California community has risen to 23, the local sheriff said Saturday evening, bringing the total number across the state to at least 25.\n\nAraya Cipollini cries near the remains of her family's home, one of 6,700 buildings burned in the deadly Camp Fire, in Paradise, Calif., on Saturday.

He said some of the victims were found in cars and in houses.\n\nThe flames burned down more than 6,700 buildings, almost all of them homes, making the blaze that destroyed Paradise one of California's most destructive wildfires since record-keeping began.\n\nMore firefighters headed to the area Saturday, with wind gusts of up to 80 km/h expected, raising the risk of conditions similar to those when the fire started Thursday, said Alex Hoon with the National Weather Service.\n\nThe blaze \u2014 known as the Camp Fire \u2014 grew to 404 square kilometres, but crews made gains and it was partially contained, officials said.\n\nReduced to rubble\n\nPeople in Paradise sidestepped metal that melted off cars and donned masks as they surveyed ravaged neighbourhoods \u2014 despite an evacuation order in place for the entire town of 27,000.\n\nSome cried when they saw nothing was left.\n\nJan MacGregor, 81, got back to his small two-bedroom home with the help of his firefighter grandson.

(Eric Thayer/Reuters)\n\nAbandoned, charred vehicles cluttered the main thoroughfare \u2014 evidence of the panicked evacuation as the wildfire tore through Thursday. The dead were found mostly inside their cars or outside vehicles and homes.\n\nFive of the dead panicked when they couldn't escape by car because their route was cut off by a wall of fire, according to Gabriel Fallon, who rode out the blaze with his parents to care for the animals on their 10-acre farm in Paradise.\n\nThe group turned the other way and dashed down the paved street until it turned into dirt and passed the Fallons' farm, he said.

Benedict said investigators were probing the circumstances of the two deaths.\n\nState officials put the total number of people forced from their homes by California's fires at more than 200,000. Evacuation orders included the entire city of Malibu that's home to some of Hollywood's biggest stars.\n\nCelebrities such as Orlando Bloom, Caitlyn Jenner, Alyssa Milano and Lady Gaga posted messages to social media describing the damage and expressing gratitude to firefighters.\n\nI am thinking so deeply for everyone who is suffering today from these abominable fires & grieving the loss of their homes or loved ones.

Of course, this is no accident, because scientists plan their missions that way.\n\nThe Mars rover Opportunity has been driving around on the red planet for nearly 15 years on a mission planned to last 90 days. The planet hunting Kepler Space Telescope, a four-year mission launched in 2009, was extended to nine years thanks to clever planning, and the Dawn mission to both an asteroid and a dwarf planet lasted 11 years after its mission was extended a couple of times.\n\nIf only our cars would run so well beyond warranty\n\nExploring deep space is expensive, especially with dwindling budgets, so scientists often only ask for funding for short-duration missions. Time is money after all. Most of the science happens at the beginning anyway, when a robot first lands on a planet or passes by another world. But the robots have to be made tough to survive the harsh environment of space, which means they are usually capable of doing much more than the originally stated goal. And the scientists do plan for much more, they just keep quiet about it until the mission is underway.\n\nAn artist's rendition of NASA's Dawn spacecraft as it was heading towards Ceres. (NASA)\n\nIn the case of the twin rovers Opportunity and Spirit, which landed on Mars in 2004, their primary 90-day mission was accomplished with ease, after which the scientists said the spacecraft are still running perfectly, so could they keep them going? That secured them the extra funding to continue, which ended up going far beyond anyone's expectations. Spirit lasted until 2010 and Opportunity fell silent last June when a dust storm swept over the entire planet and scientists have been unable to make contact with it since.\n\nIn both cases, the rovers did not die because of mechanical problems. Spirit got stuck in soft sand and Opportunity's solar panels are so covered in dust, they can't absorb enough sunlight to keep the batteries charged. If someone could go up there and push Spirit out of the sand then use a broom to sweep Opportunity off, the rovers could probably keep going. In fact NASA engineers will keep listening for Opportunity until January, just in case winds clear the dust off the little over's solar panels, and it comes back to life. But Opportunity may well be lost.\n\nIt's a huge challenge to fix things that go wrong on a machine that is millions of kilometres away. And if it can't be fixed, the scientists find ways to work around the problem.\n\nOf course it is always a bittersweet moment when they come to the end of their lives, falling silent on an alien world or drifting endlessly through space, but when they do, it is always with an enormous sense of pride that so much has been accomplished with so little. - Bob McDonald, Quirks & Quarks\n\nThe ground-breaking Kepler telescope, which has discovered more than 2,500 planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy, ran into problems with its gyroscopes that keep it pointed in space. Normally, that would be game over, but the scientists figured out a way to use the feeble pressure of sunlight to keep the telescope aimed in one direction in space, which they'd rotate between different areas every 80 days, by using the body of the spacecraft like a solar sail to keep it steady. That trick enabled the instrument to continue searching the skies for another five years until it rain out of fuel.\n\nThis illustration made available by NASA shows the Kepler Space Telescope. The planet-hunting spacecraft has been in space for nearly a decade. (NASA/Associated Press)\n\nRecord-holding spacecraft explorers\n\nThe absolute record-holders for extended warranty missions are the twin Voyagers, which left Earth in 1977 with the goal of passing by the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 ended up continuing on to Uranus and Neptune. And now both of spacecraft are leaving the solar system entirely, still sending back information about interstellar space more than 40 years later.\n\nRobotic explorers truly go where no one has gone before. They are our artificial senses that open our eyes to worlds humans have never seen before. The scientists who nurse them along for decades, overcoming broken gyros, computers that crash, or jammed wheels, treat them as pets that have been sent very, very far away from home to sniff out new environments. But most of them are on one way trips, never to return home. Of course it is always a bittersweet moment when they come to the end of their lives, falling silent on an alien world or drifting endlessly through space, but when they do, it is always with an enormous sense of pride that so much has been accomplished with so little.", "Third-party software apps that allow you to order food from a restaurant and have it delivered to your home are gaining popularity: sales are now over $2 billion annually and growth is about 15 per cent each year, according to research group NPD.\n\nThey're changing the face of the food and beverage industry and while the end-users \u2014 folks ordering food from the app \u2014 generally love it, many restaurateurs struggle with the idea.\n\nJody Palubiski is managing partner at The Charcoal Group, based in Kitchener, Ont. It's a successful company and industry leader \u2014 you can find them on Open Table, a reservation system \u2014 but they don't participate in a mobile app program such as that offered by Skip the Dishes or UberEATS.\n\nAre we training people not to come out and connect with other people and have a hospitality experience? - Jody Palubiski , The Charcoal Group\n\n\n\n\n\nPalubiski says both the cost of the service fee per order, which is negotiable depending on the restaurant's location (and is between 19 and 33 per cent), and the changing pattern of customer behaviour are problematic. He wonders if customers are being trained to stay at home.\n\n\"Are we changing the industry in which we survive?\" Palubiski said. \"Are we training people not to come out and connect with other people and have a hospitality experience?\"\n\nExposure versus experience\n\nIt's a good question, but there's also a case to be made for saying that a delivery app can result in increased promotion and mean increased revenue for the restaurant. The delivery app can be a portal into discovery, according to Xavier Van Chau, communications lead with Uber Eats Canada.\n\n\"We've heard time and time again that traffic can increase in restaurants because diners have discovered a restaurant they like through delivery,\" Van Chau said.\n\nAt delivery company Foodora, head of marketing Matt Rice adds they've seen a significant increase in mobile ordering apps in the past few years.\n\n\"I think this has opened the door to a larger pool of potential customers for restaurants, customers that would have historically picked up the phone and ordered pizza or Chinese or cooked dinner at home,\" Rice said.\n\nSteve Allen says the apps can boost his revenue and they represent a sea change. Allen owns and operates Little Louie's Burger Joint and Soupery in Cambridge, Ont., and calls the apps a \"necessary evil.\"\n\n\"A few years ago customers could choose eating here, ordering and picking up, or having it delivered without eating my bottom line. Now, there's a whole new market. The choice isn't just to order from Little Louie's. It's to order if we're on an app. If we're not, they will order from somewhere else. If I bail on that, I'm bailing on a huge market share I once used to be part of before the change,\" Allen said.\n\nSkip the Dishes provides a streamlined way for people to order restaurant meals online. But are we training people not to go out for dinner, wonders one restauranteur. (Skip the Dishes)\n\nLosing control\n\nThere is a lot of business being done. With more than a million active customers placing millions of orders each month, Skip The Dishes says they help their restaurant partners \"expand their reach, serve more customers, and earn customer loyalty. In a marketplace increasingly ruled by the expectation of greater convenience and choice, online delivery provides the options more customers want,\" according to information provided by the company.\n\nThat can certainly be the case, but in the third-party delivery process, restaurateurs don't like losing control of the food and the relationship with the customer once the packaged meal leaves the restaurant, as Nick Benninger of Waterloo Ont.'s Fat Sparrow Group explains.\n\n\"We struggle with the service aspect, both the service we get from them and the service they provide our customers on the other end. I really hate losing control of that customer piece,\" Benninger said.\n\nWhat we find frustrating is that we can't engage with the customer directly. - Jay Taylor, Morty's Pub in Waterloo, Ont.\n\nJay Taylor of Morty's Pub in Waterloo expresses a similar concern, though he recognizes their value.\n\n\"We do see the potential in the app to generate more revenue,\" Taylor said. \"What we find frustrating is that we can't engage with the customer directly.\"\n\nIt is not always the case that a restaurant is easily able to communicate directly with a diner who has had a problem with a delivery. Restaurateurs universally don't like that.\n\nCustomer complaints?\n\nUber Eats has partnered with more than 150,000 restaurants around the world and about 10,000 in Canada. Van Chau says customer contact depends on the circumstances of the incident, whether it's a missing part of the order or dissatisfaction with the food.\n\n\"That's typically managed directly through Uber,\" Van Chau said. \"We manage the refund or re-dispatch, depending on the consumer's preference.\"\n\nWhere there are issues, Skip the Dishes says it will \"work with our restaurant partners to determine how the order was affected and follow up with the customer to ensure an overall positive experience.\"\n\nAt Foodora, dissatisfied customers go through the company's support channels, according to Rice.\n\n\"There are certain instances when a restaurant would be in touch with a customer,\" he said.\n\nThompson Tran, owner of Wooden Boat Food Company in Kitchener, says he doesn't want to take a risk with the quality he is trying to achieve with his food and the customer connection.\n\n\"I'm not willing to sacrifice high-quality service and food, especially when I've spent good money on excellent ingredients. That needs to be respected,\" Tran said.\n\nLike Palubiski at Charcoal Group, the Neighbourhood Group of Companies based in Guelph, Ont., hasn't made the delivery-app leap yet. The Group, including Borealis Grille in Kitchener and Guelph, is concerned about frustrating potential customers, according to the group's chief operating officer Neil Robinson.\n\n\"My biggest fear is that most orders are coming in when we are at our busiest, and that throws a huge wrench into the flow of the kitchen if you're not used to it,\" Robinson said.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, what's interesting is that few diners likely realize the variables restaurateurs struggle with \u2014 including hefty 20 to 25 per cent fees the restaurant pays the delivery company; perhaps they don't care: all they want is food and they want it quickly caring little about the $4 or $7 delivery fee.\n\nOrder in versus eat out\n\nI asked some diners if they used a phone delivery app and what the experience was like. The vast majority of the few dozen respondents said they use one app or another, and their complaints were minor and mostly the same as if they were actually in the restaurant.\n\nFor example: the food was not hot enough, part of the order was missing, or they simply didn't like the dish. French fries, whether delivery or you take-away yourself, really can't survive a 15-minute drive.\n\nThe apps, it should be pointed out from the diner's perspective, can address important accessibility and preference issues: a few people described to me that they had difficulty with mobility, didn't have a car, or, in one case, was a pregnant mother with trouble getting around. These are all good reasons why a delivery app is useful.\n\nAs with all disruptive commercial technologies, a disconnect between merchant and consumer has been created where there wasn't one before. It's transforming the food industry, virtually all restaurateurs agree.\n\n\"It's game-changing, and we have to deal with it,\" Taylor said. \"Everything is a learning curve.\"", "A -20 degree windchill blasted the 45 teenage boys running drills on a snow-covered football field in Humboldt, Sask.\n\nThe undefeated Mohawks prepared for Saturday's championship game knowing that a provincial title would be a storybook ending, a triumph in the wake of tragedy.\n\nThe players predicted their success months ago, when they dedicated the season to their football coach and two players killed or critically injured in the Humboldt Broncos hockey team bus crash.\n\n\"We all held a piece of them in our hearts, and still do,\" Mohawks head coach Cory Popoff said.\n\n\"I think, we came together and said, 'We're going to play together and we're going to go through the season together. We're going to play for Tyler. We're going to play for Brody.\"\n\nTyler Bieber, 29, was the Mohawks receivers coach for four years. He was on the Broncos' bus as the junior hockey team's play-by-play radio announcer. Former Mohawks player and equipment manager, Brody Hinz, 18, travelled with the hockey team as their statistician.

He said he's never seen a team band together quite like this one.

Hay can picture him pacing the sidelines in front of the players, clutching his play list, handing out high fives and pats on the back.\n\n\"I felt like I needed to be there. I felt like I needed that team to know part of Tyler was there,\" Hay said. \"I do truly feel him and Brody are looking from above and are with them. And I could feel Tyler with me.\"\n\nMohawks player Bray Berschiminsky shows Tyler Bieber's mother an armband dedicated to his football coach, who was killed in the Humboldt Broncos bus crash.

The scrawny Grade 9 student realized he didn't want to play on the field, but he did love the team and the game. The head coach, Shaun Gardiner, made him equipment manager and he travelled with the team for four years.\n\nA decade later, when Bieber moved home to Humboldt, he joined the coaching staff alongside Gardiner. He would wake up at 5:30 a.m. for his morning radio gig at Bolt FM, grab an hour nap after work, then dash back out the door to coach basketball, football or flag football. He volunteered 22 hours a week on average.\n\n\"That's what I'm missing. I want to see the jubilation in him, and all the excitement,\" Hay said. \"Tyler would be so pumped that [the Mohawks] went all this way.\"\n\nFocus on the moment\n\nBrody Hinz, 18, never got a lot of playing time with the Mohawks but his commitment to the team was unrivalled. Head coach Cory Popoff says Hinz epitomizes what it means to be a Mohawk.

What is the message to everybody?\" he said in an interview. \"I realized that in fact there was an unintended potential consequence here.\"\n\nSeagram said he worried the threat of expulsion would discourage students from coming forward for help \u2014 even if someone was in medical distress due to drug consumption.\n\n\"What if someone passes out in a snowdrift and the kids are so scared of being expelled that they don't get help and so someone dies?\" he said.\n\n\"What if someone passes out in the bathroom and their friends all know but they're so scared about getting help because they know their friend will be expelled, that they let their friend asphyxiate on their own vomit?\"\n\nExpulsion reversed\n\nAt the school's weekly assembly on Wednesday, Seagram told the student body about his decision to reverse the expulsion.\n\nIn a letter sent to parents on Wednesday, he was blunt: \"I am writing today because I made a mistake,\" the letter begins.\n\nSeagram told the CBC it wasn't easy to admit that.\n\n\"Sometimes it's easier to be a brick wall and just dig your feet in and just move forward. But in the end, you have to be comfortable with that feeling in your gut,\" he said. \"And I owe it not just to my own conscience, but to the children who will be in the care of the school for years to come.\"\n\nSeagram said in future if a student is caught with drugs, expulsion will still be on the table. But if someone comes forward to ask for help, \"we can show compassion.\"\n\n'Danger looks so delicious'\n\nEdible cannabis products won't be legally available for sale in Canada for about a year, despite the legalization of recreational marijuana last month.\n\nSeagram said the students obtained the fudge off campus. The case was the school's first experience dealing with an edible cannabis product.\n\nSeagram said he hopes parents and children talk openly about drugs, but he's fearful about the potential impact of edibles on children.\n\n\"There are gummy bears and cookies and brownies and fudge, and they all look yummy and normal, and yet they are so scary and so unregulated and so available.\u2026 How can they recognize danger when the danger looks so delicious?\"\n\nCannabis and children\n\nDr. Ryan Sommers, the medical officer of health for the Nova Scotia Health Authority's northern zone, said edible cannabis products can cause serious health effects in children.\n\nSymptoms of cannabis consumption in children could include lethargy, sleepiness, trouble breathing, a reduced breathing rate, motor impairment, tremors and an increased heart rate.\n\nHe said since there is no antidote to reverse the effects of cannabis, if children come in having consumed it, they are placed on an oxygen monitor, their respiratory rate is observed and doctors wait for the effects to wear off.\n\n\"But if someone has consumed a large amount of it and their breathing rates have decreased and they have not seen a health-care provider, they could get really sick and yes, they could die from that,\" he said.\n\nSommers said overdoses are a risk with edibles because consumers may not feel high right away.\n\n\"They're not giving it time to get absorbed into their body and then they eat more and more so they end up actually consuming a large dose of it in a very short period of time,\" he said.\n\nPeople should take steps to keep cannabis edibles away from children, Sommers said.", "One year after an epic legal battle over the eligibility of a university football star played out in courtrooms in Ontario and Nova Scotia, and included a Remembrance Day court sitting, Saint Mary's University has reached a deal on the last bit of outstanding litigation related to the case.\n\nThe litigation has been costly for Saint Mary's and other parties, which have seen combined bills of at least $615,000.\n\nFor Saint Mary's, it had spent $447,342.51 on legal bills as of early May. University spokesperson Cale Loney declined to provide an updated figure to CBC News and said a freedom-of-information request was needed for that.\n\nThe university declined an on-camera interview.\n\nWhile Saint Mary's is suiting up Saturday in Halifax to play in this year's Atlantic University Sport football championship game against St. Francis Xavier, the university only got to play in the championship game last year after going to court.\n\nPhil Currie, the executive director of Atlantic University Sport, says he's happy the legal dispute with Saint Mary's University is now in the past. (CBC)\n\nThe controversy began last fall when the eligibility of wide receiver Archelaus Jack was called into question because of time he spent on the practice roster of the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2016.\n\nThe dispute centred around the language involving how long former CFL players must wait to become eligible to play at the university level.\n\nSaint Mary's interpreted the one-year wait time as one academic year, not a calendar year.\n\nAfter more than a half-million dollars in legal fees incurred by four different organizations, whether Jack was eligible may never be known.\n\nWhere the legal action started\n\nThe legal dispute first played out in Ontario when Saint Mary's said it reached an agreement on Oct. 27, 2017 with U Sports \u2014 the governing body for university sports in the country \u2014 that there weren't any eligibility issues outstanding.\n\nAccording to court documents, the agreement came about after Saint Mary's threatened U Sports with court action over the matter. In exchange for the university not pursuing legal action, U Sports agreed not to investigate the eligibility issue.\n\nThe university filed court documents with the Ontario Superior Court the week of Nov. 6, 2017, to have the U Sports agreement enforced. The court action was filed in Ontario because that's where U Sports is based.\n\nAtlantic University Sport steps in\n\nDue to concern the Ontario court wouldn't make a decision in time for the Loney Bowl on Nov. 11, Atlantic University Sport, the governing body for university sport in Atlantic Canada, cancelled the game two days before the scheduled kickoff.\n\nSaint Mary's pursued legal action in the Nova Scotia courts to allow the game to proceed. A sitting was held on Remembrance Day, and a judge ruled a day later that the game would be played. The Huskies lost to the Acadia Axemen 45-38 in overtime.\n\nLegal bills were also racked up by three organizations other than Saint Mary's.\n\nAUS has been in litigation with Saint Mary's over whether the conference's decision to cancel the game was appropriate.\n\nAcadia fans hold a sign targeting Archelaus Jack, the player whose eligibility sparked legal actions in Ontario and Nova Scotia. (Colleen Jones/CBC)\n\nPhil Currie, AUS executive director, said both parties have agreed to dismiss the legal action, which means there isn't any clarity surrounding Jack's eligibility.\n\n\"No, that hasn't necessarily been decided in reference to the individual last year who was in question,\" said Currie. \"There is also a settlement with U Sports that U Sports wouldn't pursue any further and it just really all comes to an end.\"\n\nCurrie said the move to dismiss the legal action just needs to be approved in court.\n\nAs of early May, Saint Mary's University had spent $447,342.51 on legal bills in the Archelaus Jack case. (CBC)\n\nHe said AUS spent about $44,000 in legal fees in its dispute with Saint Mary's.\n\nWith the Axemen one of the teams scheduled to play in last year's title game, Acadia University had legal representation when Saint Mary's went to court on the Remembrance Day weekend to allow the game to proceed.\n\nAcadia University spokesperson Scott Roberts said the university spent $26,254.48 on the Jack case.\n\nHe said that as a $100-million operation, Acadia is able to absorb the legal bills, but suggested the money could have been better used.\n\n\"It was money that had to be spent at the time given the circumstances ... regardless of the expenditure, if it is not directly related to our core purpose and is unexpected or unplanned, it reduces the budget we have available for other priorities,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nIn an email, Graham Brown, U Sports president and CEO, said it spent \"well over\" $100,000 on legal fees in the dispute. However, he cautions that figure doesn't tell the full story because U Sports also tapped into a \"significant\" amount of unpaid legal services.\n\n\"The final result is a great deal of time, effort, emotion and cost went into this case,\" he said.", "People in Toronto will have many options to commemorate Remembrance Day this weekend.\n\nThis year marks the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, and a variety of events around the city will pay tribute to Canada's fallen soldiers.\n\nSaturday\n\nOn Saturday at 10:30 a.m., Ontario's Lieutenant Governor, Hon.

(CBC)\n\nDwight Ball is no Danny Williams. He doesn't seem to like conflict, appears to go out of his way to not rock the boat, and clearly prefers that things be civil \u2014 and quiet \u2014 rather than rowdy and chaotic.\n\nDanny Williams? He loved him some chaos. This is the premier, after all, who said \"they should be shot\" over how Eastern Health officials handled breast cancer treatment tests. (Among many other moments, Williams pulled down Canadian flags, stomped out of a premiers' meeting, revoked access to a CBC reporter on live television \u2026 ah, memorable times.)\n\nDwight Ball's style? Very different indeed.\n\nBut make no mistake: Ball's cabinet shuffle on Thursday afternoon \u2014 hastily announced and organized, with at least one new minister learning what was happening only shortly before the rest of us \u2014 was a political message.\n\nIt was aimed largely at Eddie Joyce and Dale Kirby, who were quickly booted out of cabinet and the Liberal caucus, too, last spring, when allegations of harassment and bullying came to light.\n\nWhile it's important to note that the subsequent investigations cleared Joyce and Kirby of the more serious allegations against them, they were faulted for inappropriate conduct. Both of them were forced to apologize \u2014 oh, it was really clear they were not keen to do it \u2014 to the House of Assembly earlier this week.\n\nAnd there they still sit, maybe seething a bit, as two Independent members of the legislature.\n\nThey don't sit in caucus.\n\nAnd they certainly don't sit in cabinet.\n\nIn a style far removed from the blunt talk of Danny Williams, Dwight Ball nonetheless made it clear Thursday evening what's up \u2014 and who's in, and who's out.\n\nMembers of the new Liberal cabinet celebrate after a swearing-in ceremony Thursday.\n\n\"This is our caucus right now. This is our cabinet,\" Ball told reporters at Government House, introducing the \"group we will move forward with.\"\n\nWhile introducing new cabinet ministers Bernard Davis, Carol Anne Haley and Graham Letto, Ball was also making a point about who's not at the table now, and not likely to be there soon, either.\n\nWith an eye on an election campaign that is now a year away, he added, \"This is the team we have going into 2019 and beyond.\"\n\nA premier takes his leave\n\nSo, basically, that's as gangster as Dwight Ball gets. Politely spoken, but the message is unmistakable.\n\nHis statement to Dale Kirby and Eddie Joyce boils down to something like this: \"Sorry, dudes. It's over. You're over.\"\n\nLiberals say tensions lifting now that harassment reports have been dealt with 2:42\n\nThat's done, then. It's what's next that has some political tongues clicking.\n\nThe hastiness and rush for the swearing-in had more to do with the premier's own itinerary than, say, a desire to send a message to ousted MHAs (and those left inside, too).\n\nLater that evening, Ball left the country for a trade trip to China, where he's gone to talk up Newfoundland and Labrador's interests in iron ore and seafood.\n\nNow, the value of these trips has been debated for decades. They're definitely not cheap, and they run the risk of looking like a glamorous trip to exotic locales, with good food likely to be served. That said, proponents argue that there is intangible yet substantial value in having top political brass there when the time comes to shake hands.\n\nBut there's something riskier than a cost-benefit analysis to be considered in Dwight Ball's case.\n\nJoyce is clearly angry with his treatment. Kirby also.\n\nBut what about the rest of the caucus? The rumour mill is rife with chatter about how united \u2014 or rather not \u2014 the Liberals are at the moment. One MHA told a colleague that they advised Ball strongly not to leave the province at all.\n\nSo, that political message, mentioned above? It was also aimed at the folks still in the Liberal caucus, and the party faithful, too.\n\nDwight Ball may never sound like it, may never say it, but he's prepared to take out the axe in a second.\n\nQuote of the week\n\nWe'll give this one to Eddie Joyce, who spoke \u2014 at considerable length \u2014 on Tuesday in the House of Assembly before uttering just \"I apologize\" over his conduct. Here is some of what he had to say, about how he feels he has been treated:\n\n\"Now the officer of the house goes into the Management Commission and makes a statement which is false, and I got to stand here and take it? Is there any such thing as natural justice that \u2014 your right to be heard? Or is this just lynching? Okay, let's get it over with, and who cares about his rights. Come on; let's get it done. Is this what this is all about? This is almost getting to the point where you're almost like somewhere over in Syria where, if a neighbour leaks it to somebody else, and say, 'Oh, this guy is saying this about you,' they'd take you out and flog you before they even get a chance to speak to you.\"\n\nRona aground\n\nRona's parent company has announced the closure of stores across Canada. (CBC)\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador seemed to get wind before the rest of the country that U.S.-based Lowe's was shutting down a slew of Rona stores. Workers were called to an extraordinary meeting on a Sunday night. Even though the subject was not disclosed, those kind of meetings never have good news.\n\nThe loss of Rona stories truly marks the end of Chester Dawe Ltd., which was much more than a hardware chain. (I'm tempted to call it a lifestyle, recalling how men of a certain vintage drifted there on Saturdays.) Chester Dawe played a critical part in developing numerous subdivisions in the St. John's area (looking at you, Wedgewood Park).\n\nChester Dawe was sold to Quebec-based Rona in 2006, and while staff were kept on (and, I'm told, the company kept up its relationship with local contractors), eventually the blue-and-white branding took over.\n\nBut Rona never seemed to win its way into local hearts. Some of us in the newsroom on Monday morning remarked on how the Rona store we knew best, up in the Stavanger neighbourhood, frequently seemed to be devoid of customers, and low or out of certain things.\n\n\"You could fire a cannon and not hit anyone,\" said one of my friends in the business community. Scuttlebutt had it that Rona's new, larger location up Torbay Road not only didn't meet the ambitious targets of the new owners, but couldn't match what sales had been in the more cramped operation Chester Dawe had been running down the hill.\n\nSpeaking of Stavanger, the first major hub of big-box stores in the province, the departure of Rona is undeniably another knock for the area. Costco will be moving west to Galway in the New Year, and the old Zellers building that Target tried to relaunch is still largely empty, apart from a call centre inside. Not far away, Bowring and Bombay Company are closing down; parent company Fluid Brands has sought protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy legislation.\n\nMy colleague Ariana Kelland will have more on the Stavanger retail scene in a report we're launching Tuesday.

And it was a terrible day to die.\n\nThat Monday marked both the end of the long suffering of the First World War, and of the Canadian private's short life. His premature death, just minutes shy of a tenuous peace, was no more or less tragic than that of countless others killed during the course of the war \u2014 or afterward, because of it.\n\nBut being the last Canadian and Commonwealth soldier to die in the war to end all wars \u2014 just as so many people were celebrating \u2014 lifted him out of almost-certain anonymity.\n\nHis death on Nov. 11, 1918, ultimately made him a symbol of the futility of conflict.\n\nGeorge Lawrence Price was eventually buried in St. Symphorien Military Cemetery near Mons, Belgium. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\nBefore all that, George Price, the civilian, lived an unremarkable life.\n\nSon of Annie and James Price, he grew up in what is now Port Williams, N.S. As a young man, he moved west, ending up for a time with Canadian Pacific Railway in Moose Jaw, Sask.\n\nHe made headlines there for an unfortunate aside: Stealing \"a quantity of house effects,\" including dishes and linen, from his landlady. The value of the goods? A then-significant $25. He served one month in prison with hard labour.\n\nIt was also there that he joined the army. As a soldier in the 28th North West Battalion, Price served in the thick of the Canadian effort leading to the end of the war, according to Tim Cook, author and historian at the Canadian War Museum.\n\n\"He served throughout the Hundred Days campaign,\" said Cook, in reference to a series of successful Canadian battles in which they suffered heavy casualties.\n\nAccording to his personnel record, Price was also hospitalized for a month after a gas attack in France.\n\nThe Canadian soldiers who made it to the end were \"exhausted,\" said Cook. \"They had seen their comrades, their best friends killed. They had buried them in shallow graves.\"\n\nLetters sent home\n\nLike many around him on that Monday, Price was a conscripted soldier \u2014 drafted at 24, and without a wife or children. He wrote home diligently, sending stoic and hopeful postcards to his little sister, Florence.\n\n\"Just a line to let you know I still think of you,\" he wrote in one. \"I will see you someday.\"\n\nIn his letters to his mother, Price revealed he was a reluctant warrior.\n\n\"He didn't want to shoot anybody,\" said George Barkhouse, Price's nephew and namesake, who turned 90 last month.\n\nA last-minute mission\n\nEarly Monday, the Canadians had just taken the Belgian village of Havr\u00e9, on the outskirts of the newly liberated Mons, a city that still today remembers both Canadians and Price for their sacrifices.\n\nAt 6:30 a.m. that Monday, the Canadian Corps received official word telling them the fighting would stop that day \u2014 an armistice that would come at 11 that morning.\n\nMost of the units would have heard by runner or telegram by 9:30 a.m., Cook said.\n\n\"They had about two hours to know that the war would be over. And most of the officers simply said to the soldiers ... 'Find a hole in the ground and stay there. Don't expose yourself, don't endanger your life,'\" he said.\n\n\"They understood that this was the end of a very long and costly war. And yet for some reason, Pte.

And there are a few versions of what exactly happened with Price that morning.\n\nAccording to one account, by Pte. Art Goodmurphy, Price suggested they go sweep some buildings sitting across a narrow canal in Ville-sur-Haines to look for German soldiers.\n\nFive soldiers walked across the small bridge and arrived at one home, kicking down a door to enter. While inside, German machine guns came alive, picking at the bricks of the house.\n\nFor these German soldiers, too, the war had not yet ended.\n\nAs the Canadians ventured back out, Price was shot by a sniper. On the inside of his uniform, he was wearing a delicate flower knitted by his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nArt Goodmurphy recounts how Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was shot and died in his arms on Nov. 11, 1918 -- the last soldier of the British Empire to be killed in action in WWI. (CBC archives) 2:22\n\n\"All of a sudden \u2014 BANG. One shot came from all the way up the street. Got hit right through the back and to the heart,\" recalled Goodmurphy.\n\nVarious accounts mention a young woman who ran over and tried to help. They note that the lady of the house also tried to comfort Price.\n\nBut he went quickly: Price was dead \u2014 just a month shy of his 26th birthday.\n\n'The war is over!'\n\nGoodmurphy reported the death to his major. \"The war is over! ... The war is over!\" the major replied. \"What the hell did you go across there for?\"\n\nGeorge Barkhouse, Price's nephew and namesake, was given this frame during a trip to Belgium in 2014. It contained the knitted flower his uncle was wearing on the day of his death and a handwritten thank you note from a Belgian family. (Eric Woolliscroft/CBC)\n\nBy Goodmurphy's telling, Price never knew an armistice was imminent. \"He was just doing his job.\"\n\nA \"Killed in Action\" report filled out afterward records Price's death at three minutes before the armistice took hold \u2014 and ahead of the church bells that echoed across Mons.\n\nOther accounts \u2014 including an inscription on his old headstone, now housed at a museum in Mons \u2014 say it was just two minutes before: 10:58 a.m.\n\nLearn more about how George Price left a lasting legacy in the region where he died:\n\nThis year's Remembrance Day marks 100 years since the end of the First World War. In this weeks Dispatch, the CBC's Nahlah Ayed travels to Belgium to bring us the story of Canadian Private George Price, the last British Empire soldier killed in the First World War. 9:55\n\nIn another version, Price had crossed the bridge to say hello to a young woman who had waved to him, perhaps for a kiss or a handshake.\n\n\"It's interesting we focus on Price and what his death means, but we don't, in fact, have a clear picture of how he died,\" said Cook.\n\nBut on the other side of the ocean, what was clear was that the jubilance of that Monday was short-lived for Price's family, who had joined countless others that morning, gathering at the local park to celebrate.\n\n\"The war was over and [the family were] having a real good time,\" said Barkhouse. \"They got home and found out Uncle George had been killed. Pretty darn rough.\"\n\nBuried alongside enemy soldiers\n\nPrice was eventually buried in the St. Symphorien Military Cemetery, which is also the resting place for several German soldiers.\n\nNow, 100 Remembrance Days later, a new monument is being unveiled in Price's honour in the city of Le Roeulx, across the canal from where he died, just under a footbridge also named after him.

He had been rejected by his family when he came out as gay in his early 20s, and moved to Victoria to start over.\n\nAccording to Gajdics, the psychiatrist told him he'd created a \"false self\" that was homosexual and prescribed increasingly heavy doses of medication mixed with techniques such as primal scream therapy to \"help to silence the noise of my homosexuality.\"\n\nPeter Gajdics wrote The Inheritance of Shame to detail his six-year ordeal with a psychiatrist who tried to change his sexual orientation. He said that writing the book helped him understand he'd been 'a cog in a wheel of this institutionalized homophobia.'

But it's a game of trial and error where customers won't always buy in.\n\n\"It's a really challenging time for retailers,\" said Brynn Winegard, a Toronto-based marketing and retail expert. \"They're pressed to figure out what it is consumers want as well as to drive home profitability,\"\n\n'Scan and go' overhaul\n\nWalmart Canada made headlines last year when it announced it was rolling out \"scan and go\" in 20 locations.\n\nThe system requires customers to pick up a portable scanner in the store and use it to scan the barcode on their items before putting them in the shopping cart. The scanner tallies the bill and customers pay at the cashier or use self-checkout.\n\nOne year later, Walmart has quietly scaled back the system to only three stores. In the U.S., the retailer abandoned it completely.\n\nWith scan and go, customers scan their own items while shopping and pay for them with the aid of a mobile device provided in the store. (Walmart Canada)\n\nWalmart Canada wouldn't detail why the concept didn't catch on except to say that it's currently testing improvements to the technology, including a new scanner interface and added features.\n\n\"We are frequently testing and trying out new things in our business,\" said Walmart Canada spokesperson Anika Malik in an email. \"The way our customers shop is changing and we are constantly innovating to meet their needs.\"\n\nMalik said the same rule applies to self-checkout kiosks. She wouldn't provide numbers, but said Walmart continues to add them to stores to offer customers more choice and convenience.\n\nHowever, several shoppers complained to CBC News that their local Walmart sometimes offers no cashier option, only self-checkout, either early in the morning or late at night.\n\n\"I can just order it on Amazon if that's what they want,\" said Cody Nolan.

The machine kept going off and telling me I needed assistance.\" Meanwhile, she tried to keep an eye on her two-year-old child.\n\n\"It's not convenient,\" said Skocdopole.\n\nWalmart spokesperson Malik said the company's goal is to have a cashier option available at all times and that if none are open, customers can request one.\n\nShe also said many shoppers appreciate self-checkout and that the technology has resulted in no job losses. Instead, she said some employees have been re-deployed to other positions such as customer support for self-checkout.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThere's no doubt retail is headed toward a more automated format which will change the types of jobs involved and, ultimately, the way we shop.\n\nBut there will be hiccups along the way. Retail expert Steve Tissenbaum considers self-checkout kiosks, which many retailers now offer, as one of those hiccups.\n\n\"That is probably more of a stop-gap between more intellectual or more capable technology,\" said Tissenbaum, a professor at Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Management.\n\nAlready, retailers are testing other formats to see what sticks.\n\nFor those who still crave the human touch, Walmart and Target in the U.S. each recently launched a \"scan and go\" system where employees do the work.\n\nWorkers equipped with mobile devices both scan and checkout customers' items in busy parts of the store.

(Walmart)\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is expanding its cashier-less concept \u2014 Amazon Go. In this store, customers don't even need to scan their items.\n\nInstead, they just take what they want and walk out, thanks to technology that detects when products are removed from store shelves.\n\nCustomers are billed via their Amazon accounts.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the online retail giant has opened six Amazon Go stores in the U.S. and is reportedly considering opening up to 3,000 more in the next few years.\n\nWalmart will soon open a new cashierless Sam's Club store in Texas where shoppers scan and pay for their purchases via their smartphone.

They've come up this week at high-level meetings involving not only Canadian and Tanzanian officials but also those of other western donor nations.\n\nTanzania's homophobic actions are particularly uncomfortable for Canada, which gave Tanzania more than $125 milllion in direct aid last year, making it Canada's sixth-largest aid recipient in the world.\n\nCanada co-chairs the Equal Rights Coalition, a group of 40 nations that Canada helped to create. The coalition promotes LGBT equality around the world and has roundly condemned some of the practices used in Tanzania \u2014 particularly the use of forced anal exams to collect \"evidence\" of homosexual behaviour, which in Tanzania can lead to a life sentence in prison.\n\n'Give me their names'\n\n\"Give me their names,\" Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Paul Makonda said in a message to the people of Tanzania's biggest city last week, according to reports by Agence France-Presse. \"My ad hoc team will begin to get their hands on them next Monday.\"\n\nThe teams, Makonda said, are composed of police officers, agents of the Tanzania Communications Authority and \"media practitioners\" who troll through social media accounts in search of homosexual behaviour. They received over 5,000 tips on their first day of operations, he said.\n\nMany gay men in the city are now in hiding, according to local media reports. Others have said they've received extortion demands with threats to denounce them to the vigilante squads.\n\n\"These homosexuals boast on social networks,\" Makonda said, adding their homosexuality \"tramples on the moral values of Tanzanians.\"\n\nAs the anti-gay squad prepped for its first patrols in Dar es Salaam, police on the island of Zanzibar arrested ten men.\n\nSeif Magango, Amnesty International's deputy director for East Africa, issued a statement saying the men had been arrested for sitting together in pairs.\n\n\"We now fear these men may be subjected to forced anal examination, the government's method of choice for 'proving' same-sex sexual activity among men,\" he said.\n\n\"This must not be allowed to happen. These men must be released immediately.\"\n\nCanada asks for explanations\n\nAs anti-gay harassment has increased since the election of President John Magufuli (nicknamed \"The Bulldozer\") in 2015, western donors in the country have formed an \"LGBT task force\" to coordinate their efforts to get the government to change course.\n\nCanada cooperates closely with other countries on the issue, including the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Ireland.\n\nGovernment officials told CBC News that Canada's new high commissioner to Tanzania, Pamela O'Donnell, raised the matter with President Magufuli when she presented her credentials on Thursday.\n\nBut some countries have reacted more strongly than others to the persecution campaign.\n\nLast Saturday, the U.S. warned its citizens in the country to be aware of the threat of arrest and to delete any compromising material on their phones.\n\nOn Monday, the European Union went further, withdrawing its ambassador from the country.\n\nCanadian officials have been reluctant to go that far. After meeting with Canadian and other foreign diplomats, Tanzania's ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement distancing itself from Makonda's vigilante squads.\n\n\"The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania would like to clarify that, what was said was only personal opinion and not the government's stand,\" reads the statement. \"The United Republic of Tanzania will also continue to respect and uphold all human rights as provided for in the country's constitution.\"\n\nBut the Magufuli government said nothing about stopping the anti-gay crusade proclaimed by Makonda, who is seen as a loyal acolyte of the president. As for Makonda himself, the devout Christian blew off the concerns of donor nations, saying, \"I prefer to anger those countries than anger God.\"\n\nAnd the national government has itself engaged in persecution campaigns. Last year it threatened to publish the names of gay Tanzanians and ordered the closure of 40 walk-in HIV clinics backed largely by foreign NGOs and governments \u2014 because the government accused them of encouraging homosexuality.\n\n\"Have you ever come across a gay goat or bird?\" Tanzania's Deputy Minister of Health tweeted last year (in Swahili) while defending the arrests of gay men and the closure of HIV clinics.\n\nCanada has devoted much of its AIDS money to maternal health and adolescent girls' health \u2014 only to see the Tanzanian government criticize such efforts. President Magufuli has claimed that foreigners are promoting birth control for sinister motives and has urged Tanzanian women to \"throw away your contraceptives.\"\n\n\"Those going for family planning are lazy,\" Magufuli said, saying they could not be bothered to feed more children. Even as experts warn of a looming over-population disaster in the Great Lakes region of Africa, Tanzania's government is encouraging women to have all the children they can.\n\nRights group warns: Pushing too hard can backfire\n\n\"This is a matter of great concern to our government,\" Adam Austen of Global Affairs Canada told CBC News. \"We have raised this issue directly with the government of Tanzania and continue to monitor the situation, working with our like-minded friends and allies. The government of Tanzania has made clear that this is not official policy.\"\n\nLouis Belanger, a spokesman for International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, told CBC that the government \"take(s) note of the Tanzanian Government's statement stating that the Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner announcing a campaign against gay acts within Dar es Salaam city was 'only personal opinion and not the government's stand'.\"\n\nSpeaking on background, officials said Canada would wait and see what happens next before deciding its next moves.\n\nRights groups point out that the Tanzanian government has promised not to target gays in the past, and yet the raids and arrests continue, both in Dar es Salaam and in other parts of the country.\n\nAmnesty International isn't faulting Canada for its cautious approach to the problem, however.\n\n\"All too often LGBT rights are seen by some countries as a northern, western creation,\" said Amnesty's Jacqueline Hansen. \"So sometimes, if the push to protect LGBT rights comes from countries like Canada, it can actually have a negative effect.\"\n\nHansen said recent outside efforts to help LGBT activists facing pressure in neighbouring Uganda offer a case in point.\n\n\"In-country activists told us, 'Please don't take action from the west, this is going to make things worse. We need action from inside sub-Saharan Africa, this is what's going to be helpful to make a difference.'\n\n\"We know from previous experience that if foreign aid is cut because of LGBT rights, that can actually fuel backlash against LGBT people in that country.

It's frustrating.\n\n\"What we're trying to do right now is gently, in a way that won't inflame things, show acts of solidarity online with activists in Tanzania, so they know the world is watching, and they're not alone, and we're here poised to take action in whatever way they deem appropriate.\"\n\nCanada's new ambassador to Tanzania, Pamela O'Donnell, seems to be doing some of that in her first tweets.", "Get ready for a windy Saturday.\n\nDeveloping wind gusts out of the southwest could be up around 60 km/h and with a high just above the freezing point, be prepared if you are venturing out.\n\nWe can expect a few sunny breaks, but the clouds will thicken with some flurries blowing through from time to time.\n\nSunday will be bright, breezy and cold.", "A new ad campaign by the Canadian Down Syndrome Society that features people with genetic disorder in animal costumes and asks that they be added to the endangered species list is getting mixed reviews, but it's also drawing attention to an important issue, advocates say.\n\nElaine Willcock, a member of the Canadian Down Syndrome Society's board of directors and a mother of two children with the disorder, said Canada doesn't keep statistics on people with Down syndrome, but in the U.S., the population has dropped by about 30 per cent.\n\n\"And what we're finding is, as the population of people with Down syndrome shrinks, so do their resources,\" Willcock told CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning on Friday.\n\nIn March 2019, the society plans to submit its official application for people with the syndrome to be added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's endangered species list.\n\nThe goal is to try to get more funding and resources for people living with the disorder.\n\n'Just asking for the same level of support'\n\n\"It's [a serious proposal] because we want to make the stand that the world puts a lot of money in support to endangered animals.

The U.K. data watchdog \u2014 a Canadian who spent six years as British Columbia's privacy commissioner \u2014 just wrapped up an 18-month investigation into political advertising following the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's alleged improper use of data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook users.\n\nDenham told host Chris Hall that after her team of 40 investigators combed through 700 terabytes of seized data \u2014 the equivalent of 52 billion pages \u2014 they came to some sobering conclusions.\n\n\"We examined the practices of political parties and campaigns and we were astounded by the amount of personal information they had available, and also the lack of transparency and disregard for voters' privacy,\" she said.\n\nWhy Canadians should care about data protection\n\nNow, Denham is calling on the international community to start policing the data policies of political parties and campaigns, and of social media companies like Facebook.\n\n\"It's a global issue and it needs a global solution. The laws have to allow for extraterritorial reach and we can't do it alone,\" she said.\n\nIn Canada, Denham said, she'd like to see stricter privacy laws on the protection of citizens' data, similar to laws already in place in the European Union.\n\n\"In the EU, we had a once-in-a-generation reboot in improvement of our data protection laws,\" she said. \"To look behind the curtain to examine algorithms, to issue sanctions and fines when companies get it wrong. These are tools that are not available to the Canadian privacy commissioner.\"\n\nCanadian political parties still aren't subject to any rules governing the personal information they gather on citizens \u2014 everything from names and addresses to political opinions.\n\nThe Privacy Act governs information held by government bodies. The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) applies to private companies.

Because then the parties are marking their own homework.\"\n\nIn the U.K., Denham has advocated for a statutory and enforceable code of conduct for political campaigning. She'd like to see something similar in Canada.\n\n\"I think that's the way to get it right, if all the players know what the rules are and they're singing from the same song sheet.\"\n\nUntil that happens, Canadians should keep asking questions of their political parties and social media companies, she said.\n\n\"Then people can challenge what's being fed into their newsfeed.

The War to End Wars. The War to Make the World Safe for Democracy. The Great War.\n\nThe Great Mistake, is more like it. The Great Blunder. Perhaps the most hideous and stupid error ever committed in the history of humanity.\n\nThe conflict of 1914-1918 wasn't really about anything. It was not about freedom, democracy or human dignity. There were no good guys or bad guys. There was only stupidity, pigheaded ego and a total disregard for human life.\n\nThe soldiers in the trenches believed they were the good guys, of course. They had to, otherwise they would not have been there. The Germans were defending \"kultur,\" the Russians the Orthodox Faith, the Western Allies were fighting for \"freedom,\" whatever that meant. They were brave, and they were loyal, and nothing can take away from their service and sacrifice.\n\nCasualties of war\n\nCanada sent more than 600,000 personnel to fight in that conflict, most of them foreign-born men who joined our army for what they could get out of it: three square meals, a payday and ticket home to the British Isles, where most of them were born. Foreign mercenaries, essentially. When the war ended our own men made up only about half the strength of the Canadian Expeditionary Corps.\n\nOf those wearing our uniform, 60,000 died, and tens of thousands were hideously maimed, physically and mentally. The main cause of their death and dismemberment was the stupidity of their British commanders, who ordered them time and time again to walk upright into the enemy machine-guns.\n\nIn the intervening century we have built a delusional myth that this war united us, created a Canadian identity, and brought us to prominence on the world stage. In fact, it divided us and came close to sundering the country over the conscription crisis. While we let British-born men fight for us, Canadians hung back for the most part, and conscription was unpopular not just in Quebec, but across Canada.\n\nOf those wearing our uniform, 60,000 died, and tens of thousands were hideously maimed, physically and mentally. (Library and Archives Canada)\n\nMy wife's great uncle, Ernest Charles Drury, who would go on to become premier of Ontario, campaigned in the khaki election of 1917 on an anti-conscription platform, in the riding of North Simcoe. Many other English-speaking Canadians, in particular unionized workers and farmers, opposed conscription. It was not simply a French-English divide.\n\nIn 1914, hundreds of millions of people lived reasonably stable lives in four great empires: German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Ottoman. The Great War swept all of that away and led to two decades of famine, disease, inflation and brutality, and ultimately to the Second World War, a conflict that no moral society could avoid.\n\nIf that first war had not been fought, there likely would have been no Second World War, no Hitler, no Mussolini, no Stalin, no Holocaust and no Holodomor. And no Cold War either.\n\nThe Second World War ended two years before I was born. Yet on Remembrance Day in most cities and towns across this country, we still use the maudlin and lachrymose hymns, prayers and invocations of the Edwardian era to commemorate those who served in our forces, and those who died.\n\nOutside of major metropolitan centre, Remembrance Day ceremonies are largely Christian religious services, ignoring the diversity of our society and our forces. The main theme is one of willing self-sacrifice (The Book of John, \"Yourselves you scorned to save\"), even though our soldiers serve in the hope and expectation that they will survive and come home in one piece.\n\nVeterans salute during a Remembrance Day ceremony in Montreal, Saturday, November 11, 2017. (Graham Hughes/Canadian Press)\n\nPerhaps it is time to draw a line under The Great War. In the past three-quarters of a century, tens of thousands of Canadians have put their lives on the line in the Middle East, Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda, East Timor, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Many have suffered wounds visible and invisible. Many have died.\n\nThey are just as dead as those of Vimy Ridge and Juno Beach. The loss and pain and grief are no different. So why not have a Remembrance Day that meaningfully includes them, in their diversity and their service to this country?\n\nWe have recently learned that the previous government, which ended the lifetime provision of care in favour of lump sum payments, also shortchanged us out of millions of dollars in disability allowances, and it will be 2020 before the present government can fix it.\n\nMaybe we should dump \"O Valiant Hearts!\" and start singing along with Twisted Sister:\n\n\"We're Not Gonna Take It!\"\n\nHow would that sound down at the Cenotaph?\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nWhat's next for Canada-U.S. relations in the wake of the recent U.S. midterm elections? Is the coverage of American politics taking up too much airtime in Canada? How can the media fight against the moniker of \"fake news\"? Are there more surprises to come with the USMCA trade agreement?\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland joined The National co-hosts Rosemary Barton and Adrienne Arsenault, CBC News Washington correspondent Keith Boag, and Washington Post journalists Aaron Blake and Karoun Demirjian to discuss these topics and others during a special edition of \"The National Conversation\" this week in Toronto.\n\nCanadians posed questions in person and on social media to the panel, covering an extensive range of issues that have relevance on both sides of the border. Here are excerpts from that discussion:\n\nU.S. midterm elections\n\nDid the results of the U.S. midterms make it harder for diplomatic relations?\n\nChrystia Freeland: When I saw those results, I said what I think every Canadian government always says after every U.S election, which is a core job of any federal government of Canada, a core job of any Canadian foreign minister, is to have a working relationship with whoever the Americans elect. And that was our job before Tuesday, and that is our job after Tuesday, and that will be our job after the 2020 elections. We Canadians are pretty good at working with the Americans, it's been a core job of Canadian federal governments for as long as we've been a country and we're good at working with all different types and flavours of Americans and that's what we're going to keep on doing.\n\nCan Canadians trust Trump?:\n\nChrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister and Canada\u2019s direct diplomatic line to the White House, responds to questions during The National Conversation panel at CBC in Toronto about whether or not Prime Minister Justin Trudeau trusts U.S. President Donald Trump. 1:20\n\nWere you surprised by the midterm election results?\n\nKaroun Demirjian: You could have made this guess a year ago: that the House was inclined to go Democratic, that the Senate [and] the races that were up this year, it looked like the Republicans should hold onto the Senate, unless something went very wrong. The president, as angry as he was the next day in that press briefing, had to be breathing a sigh of relief because he didn't lose the Senate. Because it means that he can push ahead with this Republican plan to get as many conservative judges on the course as possible, which is the long-term game that could really change the general culture of the country over the next generation. But Democrats are going to start investigating him on Day 1; they're probably not going to try to impeach him because that would risk too much. But that's just going to create fights between Congress and the White House, between the two houses, between Democrats and Republicans. And if the last two years were divided and acrimonious in the United States, just buckle in, because it's going to be worse coming up.\n\nAaron Blake: I think what we saw on Tuesday was a combination of the growing frustration and the fact that the president wants to use the media as his foil. And also perhaps some frustration as to how the election had gone the night before, where the president suffered the largest defeat for a Republican House since 1974. It was not a good night for him and I think there was frustration showing there.\n\nWashington Post journalists Karoun Demirjian, left, and Aaron Blake answer audience questions during 'The National Conversation' panel discussion on Thursday. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nUSMCA trade agreement\n\nWhy were tariffs imposed during the negotiations?\n\nChrystia Freeland: There was some surprise in Canada, and I think around the world, when the tariffs were imposed. There is no reasonable argument to have imposed these tariffs on Canada \u2014 that's what we said at the beginning. It is actually absurd. And that's why when the tariffs were imposed, we said that we would impose retaliatory measures. And we did. Our retaliation is balanced, it is perfectly reciprocal dollar-for-dollar retaliation, it went into force on July 1, and our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. tariffs are lifted. So Canada's position is: Lift these tariffs now, they're hurting everybody.\n\nAre tariffs good for Canada and the U.S.?:\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says that Canadian and U.S. tariffs are hurting both countries and she wishes they could be lifted immediately. 0:33\n\nWhat was the biggest concession you made during the negotiations?\n\nChrystia Freeland: Any negotiation, obviously, involves compromise; that's why it's a negotiation. Otherwise we would just have our list of what we want and get it. I think probably the issue \u2014 which Canadians are very aware was a difficult one and where the U.S. wanted increased access \u2014 was access to the Canadian dairy market. I feel comfortable with the deal that we struck. The level of increased access is comparable to was what agreed to by the Conservative government in the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] negotiations. That was a compromise that we offered to the United States as part of a broader deal. Another thing that we got rid of, which I am really pleased about, is something that was known as the energy ratchet clause, which committed us to selling a certain portion of our energy exports to the United States. To me, that impinges on our sovereignty and I am glad that that is gone too.\n\nDid Canada have leverage in the negotiations?\n\nChrystia Freeland: Well, there's always leverage. Canada is the largest market for the United States \u2014 larger than China, Japan and the U.K. combined. So we do have leverage in the relationship. But we think it's important to use leverage in the right places. We believe in rules, we believe in laws, we believe in procedures, and we believe that everything should be kept in its own lane.\n\nU.S.-Canada relations\n\nDo you feel like Canada is still an American ally?\n\nChrystia Freeland: We are very much an ally of the United States, and they are very much our ally. We are partners in NATO, we have shared obligation to one another under Article 5, and equally importantly, we are partners in NORAD. NORAD is the only joint command that the United States participates in in the world. It's a joint command of Canadians and Americans, and that close relationship is essential because of geography, because of this vast unmilitarized \u2014 and really used by human beings \u2014 border. So, yes, of course we're allies.\n\nAaron Blake: I think the president actually projects the way a lot of Americans feel about this relationship. Maybe not in the exact words that he uses. But he views even longtime allies, even neighbours, as business partners, as competitors and as adversaries when it comes to jobs, when it comes to trade deficits. It's all part of making deals. There was an interview just a few weeks ago in which the president was on 60 Minutes and he was asked about imposing tariffs on Canada, on Japan, on South Korea. And Lesley Stahl said, \"Why are you doing this to our allies?\" And the president says, \"What's an ally?\" He's questioning the very notion of an ally and I think the treatment of countries like Canada is very much an outgrowth of that. He is challenging the very notion that a country like Canada needs to be treated any differently than a country like Russia does.\n\nDoes Trump consider Canada an ally?:\n\nWhat\u2019s the state of Canada\u2019s relationship with the U.S.? Washington Post politics reporter Aaron Blake says the days of traditional alliances are over. 0:57\n\nShould we be concerned with the rise of populism in the U.S. coming to Canada?\n\nKeith Boag: What Donald Trump has done, that he probably didn't intend to do, is make people more aware that they can't take anything for granted now. And we have the good fortune to be able to learn this from a distance. Our friends in America do not: they have to live through it. What's happening in the United States is not a small story. It is a huge story \u2026 and I don't intend in any way to sound condescending about that, but alarm bells should be going off all over the place about this. There's nothing that he will not toss aside, rip to shreds, grind down if that happens to be in his personal interest. And I think we have to be hardened against this, and speak truthfully, and with the principles of objectivity and some detachment and accuracy as always. But we can't be blind to what's actually happening here, because it's not normal.\n\nTrump and the media\n\nDo Canadian news outlets focus too much on American politics?\n\nAdrienne Arsenault: Well, I mean you can't choose your family. I'm sorry, mom. Look, we have no choice. We were just talking backstage that when Paul Hunter, another Washington correspondent, went down to the U.S. in the 2016 election \u2026 a pastor said to him, \"Why are you here?\" And then the pastor stopped and answered his own question and said, \"Oh, I guess you'd want to know if your neighbour's house is burning down.\" Right? You'd stick your head out the window and smell for smoke. So there's an element of that going on. We have no choice, for good and for bad. What happens there affects us. Are we spending too much time on the American story? You know, it's interesting. Sometimes people say that and then on the night of the midterms, CNN in Canada had well over a million viewers. Now that's interesting for CNN in Canada. So when Canadians tell you they're not interested, I'm afraid they're not telling the truth.\n\nHow does the term 'fake news' affect the media?\n\nThe National co-host Adrienne and CBC News Washington correspondent Keith Boag discuss the dangerous impact of the president's rhetoric around the free press on democracy. 0:39\n\nHow do you effectively cover Trump in the media?\n\nAaron Blake: It's a constant situation where we're adjusting, figuring out new ways, re-evaluating ourselves. I think what you're seeing in the latter parts of the 2018 midterms is that it's not just that they stopped airing these rallies live, they stopped airing them. And then once they were over, they instantly did a bunch of fact-checks about exactly what was said in the rally and why it was wrong. We are seeing a change of course. I think, though, that there are some people that wish that if we ignored President Trump, they think that he might just go away. They think that by putting the things that he says out there \u2014 even if we're fact-checking them in real time \u2014 somehow this is doing him a favour. I disagree with that. I think that's too cynical to think that the people can't understand what's true and false, if you're telling them what's true or false. We may need to increase media literacy to get people to actually understand what we're telling them, but there is no amount of fact-checking that I think is too much. If people don't care that the president is saying things that are false, that's on them, and you're probably not going to get through to them anyway.\u200b\n\nWere you surprised by the heated exchange between Trump and CNN journalist Jim Acosta?\n\nAdrienne Arsenault: I watched what happened there with Jim Acosta \u2026 sort of as a warning for us here. And a couple of things come to mind. I can't personally imagine the intestinal fortitude of being a White House correspondent right now; he must have a stack of Rolaids somewhere. But I also think there's a trap \u2014 and that's taking the bait of sort of becoming so frustrated that you stand up again and start arguing with the president. And I can understand on a human level how that happens, but I see it as a warning sign to the rest of us: that this is a time that we're being challenged as journalists and it's evermore important to just do your job and be calm and try to stay above reproach. Because people are looking for you to take the bait.\n\nWatch the exchange in question between Trump and Acosta:\n\nThe White House suspended CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after accusing him of \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern\" during an exchange with Trump. 0:34\n\nAaron Blake: What we just saw in the video there, and what actually happened, was an extension of what we've been seeing for the better part of three years and the rhetoric at his rallies, where he's been calling the media fake news. It's been occasional clashes in the briefing room with reporters. There was one point at which CNN was declined from attending an event in the Rose Garden in the White House. They have scaled back the number of daily briefings to almost nothing. So the White House is taking these kinds of punitive measures as we move along in order to try and get more favourable coverage or to punish coverage that they don't necessarily appreciate.\n\nKeith Boag: It undermines us. I think [Washington Post executive editor] Marty Baron has it right: \"We're not at war, we're at work.\" And that kind of scene makes it look as if we are at war. We can't afford that, because we won't win that. It services the argument that the president is making to his most loyal supporters \u2014 that we are their enemy too. I think it's important to understand what the president's doing here, very clearly though. He's not trying to push back against just a news story or the negativity of what he perceives to be their coverage: It is really an attempt to undermine the public's trust in all media to persuade them that there is another reality that can be defined by the president alone. And that is such a dangerous thing, because a free press is a cornerstone of a free democracy. And so his attacks on the press in that context are an attack on democracy. It's a difficult thing for us to cover. We are used to covering things that fall within what can be defined, I think, as legitimate controversy. And I think we're good at that even though we make mistakes; we know how to do that. But too many things with this president have fallen outside legitimate controversy into an area of deviance \u2014 and we're still learning how to cover that.\n\nChrystia Freeland: It is important for political leaders, political leaders particularly of democracies, to speak out for journalists. I think a lot of us have been thinking a lot about what makes democracies, democracies. And maybe a simplistic way of thinking about it is it's just that people vote \u2014 a democracy is where you democratically elect your leaders. But I think a lot of people have been realizing that a democracy is much more than that. It's about a set of institutions and a set of behaviours that hold those elected leaders to account and hold them in check.\n\nWatch the full 'The National Conversation' on the future of U.S.-Canada relations here:", "Doctors at over 300 walk-in clinics in British Columbia want fair payment for their work compared with those in full family practice, says the head of an association that's rallying its members to increase access and profits through innovative technology.\n\nMike McLoughlin, founding director of the Walk-In Clinics of B.C.

They are paid a regular fee per patient up to 50 patients a day. After that, the fee drops by half to about $30 for a basic visit \u2014 until they reach 65 patients and then they get no fee at all.\n\nMike McLoughlin, founding director of Walk-In Clinics of B.C., says walk-in clinics must close when their daily patient quota is reached.

This 50-person-a-day cap has created this anxiety among patients that they gotta get there early to see a doctor,\" he said, adding long lineups outside clinics means they must close when the quota is reached.\n\nHe said many of the clinics could consider working towards enhancing technology to provide patients with better service, beyond seeing wait times online.\n\nMcLoughlin also called on the government to work toward allowing patients' electronic medical records to be accessible to any physician they see, whether they are at their regular doctor's office, a walk-in clinic or an emergency department.\n\nOngoing relationship vs. 'episodic care'\n\nDr. Eric Cadesky, president of Doctors of B.C., said walk-in clinics provide \"episodic care,\" but their physicians don't do the work to justify an annual bonus for treating complex conditions that must be regularly monitored through an ongoing relationship with patients.\n\n\"Every day I probably call 10 to 20 patients, I probably email another 10 or 30 patients,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes the person doesn't need to see a doctor and sometimes I may not be in the office. It may be on the weekend or I may be away, but I'm able to continue that relationship and help people make the best decision possible.\"\n\nContinuity of care is missing in walk-in clinics, Cadesky said.\n\n\"In an ideal system patients would be able to access doctors that know them and know their history and are able to care for them in the context of an ongoing relationship.\"\n\nWalk-in clinics play valuable role: Dix\n\nHealth Minister Adrian Dix said walk-in clinics could be part of the move to attach more patients to family doctors through yet-to-be opened primary care networks that will include various health-care providers such as nurse practitioners, physiotherapists and dieticians.\n\n\"We have a very significant group of people who are unattached to a family doctor, currently in excess of 750,000 people,\" he said.\n\n\"Walk-in clinics absolutely play a valuable role today and I actually think there's potential for them as private primary care networks to work with other practitioners in the community.\"\n\nHealth Minister Adrian Dix said walk-in clinics play a valuable role in the province. (Richard Zussman/CBC News)\n\nThe government is working to harmonize electronic medical records in order to quickly access patient information after the previous government's failed attempts cost millions of dollars, Dix said.\n\n\"I think making sure that everyone has appropriate access to the record is an important and useful thing and community by community we have to make sure that happens,\" he said. \"I'm very disappointed. I would have assumed 10 years ago we would have been further along.\n\nUjjal Dosanjh, a former federal health minister and premier of British Columbia, was scheduled as a keynote speaker at the walk-in clinics' meeting.\n\nWhile the clinics provide vital access to doctors who should have access to electronic medical records, the patient quota should not be scrapped, Dosanjh said.\n\n\"If you go to 70 patients a day I'd say it's more of a commercial enterprise than a public health enterprise.\"", "In the first eight days of November, Winnipeg police recorded 12 separate gun incidents in the city, including an apparently random shooting, a shotgun attack that left a woman blinded in one eye and two police standoffs in a single day.\n\nFrom Nov. 1 to Nov. 8, a police spokesperson confirmed four shootings, four instances of shots being fired, three police standoffs, a gun seized in an arrest and two firearms arrests \u2014 including one that began as a traffic stop when a police officer saw a shotgun out in the open between the driver and passenger.\n\nThe string of incidents prompted one community group, the North End organization Meet Me at the Bell Tower, to start a conversation at its weekly community meeting Friday about how to address the violence.\n\n\"A lot of folks are having those conversations about being afraid,\" said Michael Redhead Champagne, a co-founder of the group. \"And so right now, we're hearing a lot of people talking about the fear.\"\n\nA graphic shows the locations of the four shootings that took place in Winnipeg over four days in early November.

In his experience, being high on meth can cause paranoia. Combined with lack of sleep \u2014 meth can let you stay awake for days on end \u2014 and psychosis sometimes induced by the drug, it can push people to violence.\n\nHe believes perpetrators in that mental state may not even realize the damage they're doing.\n\nDane Bourget, co-founder of peer support group Jibb Stop, said he understands the connection between meth use and gun violence. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\n\"You're up for so long and the psychosis is so strong, that there's no way out \u2014 you don't feel like there's a way out. And you just escalate and escalate,\" Bourget said. \"Before you know it, you're in this terrible situation that you can't get out of and you think that that's your only option.\"\n\nAs meth use spikes in the city, Bourget said he's not surprised to see a rise in gun incidents. Without an increase in treatment options and support services for people trying to stop using, Bourget said he sees it continuing.\n\n\"There's going to be a wave coming that \u2014 it's not going to be stoppable unless they get in front of it right now,\" he said.\n\nPoverty, trauma root of problem: Community members\n\nBefore the Meet Me at the Bell Tower event on Friday, Redhead Champagne said violence isn't new to his neighbourhood. He thinks overall, it's been worse in the past than it is now despite the recent jump in gun incidents.\n\nRedhead Champagne and another Meet Me at the Bell Tower co-founder, Jenna Wirch, said violence in their community stems from the socioeconomic situations facing residents as well as the intergenerational effects of trauma from residential schools and colonization.\n\n\"I think that as long as there is poverty, you're not going to get rid of the violence, right? We need to understand what is poverty and what makes poverty, and how are we going to address the root causes of what makes people poor?\" Wirch said.\n\n\"And stop pushing down these people who are in poverty, and who are creating this violence.\"\n\nLacey Gamblin, a mother of 3, said recent violence in her neighbourhood affects her daily. (Walther Bernal/CBC)\n\nThey're hoping to organize a medicine walk to nearby sites of recent shootings, bringing tobacco, prayers and songs for healing.\n\nEvent attendee Gamblin said in her eyes, the solution to the problem is in community initiatives like Meet Me at the Bell Tower.\n\n\"I think when you come together at the Bell Tower it gives people hope that things will get better, or at least things will change \u2014 like a shift and a wave.\"", "The best night's sleep come when you feel at your most comfortable and safe.\n\nIt's a feeling that 35-year-old Myron Bateman didn't know for nearly two decades.\n\nBateman's mother died when he was a teenager. That's when the Winnipeg man started to spiral into addiction.\n\nMyron Bateman in younger days. (Submitted/M.Bateman)\n\nBy 2000, Bateman was struggling with an addiction to alcohol. Soon after, he discovered the highly addictive substance known as methamphetamine.\n\n\"I was searching for something else to spend my 10 dollars on,\" he said. \"And then I bumped into somebody who was like: 'Try this out for your 10 bucks and come back and let me know.'\"\n\n\"I ended up being at his door every six to eight hours.\"\n\nFor the next 18 years, Bateman was more concerned about getting his fix than resting or sleeping.\n\n\"Sleep was really irrelevant for somebody in that scene,\" he recalled. \"My motto was: 'Sleep is for the dead. No rest for the wicked.'\"\n\nWhen night came, he would spend more time awake than asleep.\n\n\"My nights would [consist of] walking end-to-end of the city,\" he explained. \"Just being fascinated with the euphoric feeling that meth gives you.\"\n\nInstead of sleeping, Bateman would often spend his nights in a frantic state.\n\n\"[I'd do things] like taking apart electronics and thinking I knew what I was doing,\" he said. \"Or I'd end up drawing on a piece of paper and didn't realize how much time had passed. I'd drain a whole pen just drawing things that made no sense.\"\n\n\"The sun would rise and the sun would set and then finally that fix ran out or the money ran out,\" he continued.\n\n\"I'd be so exhausted and I'd come to Main Street Project and I'd be like: 'Hey I just need to sleep, eat,' and they'd say: 'Sure Myron, grab a mat at the back.'\"\n\nIt was that kindness that brought Bateman back to the shelter in early Sept., 2018. He was in a meth psychosis. He was incoherent and hadn't slept in days. Peer counsellor Phil Goss encouraged him to check himself into rehab with the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba. Goss was once an addict himself and is committed to helping others now.\n\nFor Phil Goss, psychosis followed long periods of sleeplessness after using meth. He spent several years behind bars before turning his life around. He now works as a peer advocate at Main Street Project. 1:57\n\nAfter numerous overdoses and ending up in the hospital, Bateman knew he had had enough.\n\n\"What made me want to change my life was feeling depressed,\" he said. \"That sense of hopelessness \u2014 that I wasn't going anywhere, and wondering 'Hey, am I going to wake up this day?'\"\n\n\"I don't just want to exist. I want there to be a purpose in my path.\"\n\nOne of his big motivations is his family.\n\n\"I'm just proud to be a Bateman. Proud that I got those tools from my father mostly \u2014 like hard work,\" he said.\n\n\"You can accomplish anything you put your mind to and that's what I want to do in my journey through sobriety.\"\n\nWhen Bateman committed to getting treatment at AFM, he was nominated to be a senior peer. It meant waking up fellow recovering addicts every morning, reminding them to start another day of sobriety, and leading the meetings.\n\n\"The agenda for the day is to wake up, have your shower, come down to the board room, offer tokens to clients that have passed the program,\" he said. \"We pass them their gold coin and send them happily along their way.\"\n\n\"After that we'd have lunch, more programming, counselling, meditation. At 3:45 we made a daily review and that would be the day.\"\n\nMyron Bateman is thankful to Phil Goss of Main Street Project in Winnipeg for guiding him towards rehab at Addictions Foundation of Manitoba. (CBC)\n\nThings have improved since Bateman entered treatment. When asked what constitutes a good night's sleep, he is quick to reply.\n\n\"The key to having a good night's sleep probably would be putting in a good eight or 10 hours of hard honest work,\" he said. \"Just like everybody else in the whole entire world.\"\n\n\"It's been a very restless 18 years. The only time of peace and rest I got was down at Main Street Project,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, at AFM, it's all peaceful. It's easy to go to bed at 10:30 and wake up at 5:00.\"\n\nBateman is looking forward to someday having his own apartment, starting his own business and living a clean life.\n\n\"I like to think of myself as a gentleman, a good, solid person to have when you're scared, and a good listener,\" he added.\n\n\"I thank my mom for that.\"", "Brad Gushue as the St. John's, N.L., remained perfect at the Tour Challenge with a 6-3 victory over Scotland's Ross Paterson on Friday night.\n\nGushue (4-0) posted a perfect record when he won the Grand Slam of Curling event last year in Regina.\n\nThe 11-time GSOC title winner will hold the hammer to start Saturday's quarterfinals and through the rest of the playoffs should his team advance.\n\nPaterson was eliminated with the loss, holding a 1-3 record.\n\nGushue will face the winner of the morning tiebreaker between Regina's Matt Dunstone and Glenn Howard of Penetanguishene, Ont.\n\nDunstone (2-2) scored a 5-4 win over Switzerland's Peter de Cruz (3-1) earlier Friday to force the extra game.\n\nMeanwhile, Calgary's Kevin Koe qualified with a 2-2 record.

It is an incredibly destructive and polarizing force,\" said the rookie councillor.\n\n\"Let's get our focus back\"\n\nShe intends to vote against the bid in next week's plebiscite.

So if we're maintain our status as a winter sports city, we're going to have to make that investment.\"\n\nHe wouldn't suggest how people should vote.

Can you tell us about it?\n\nA: This was an interview that I did 20 years ago here in Calgary, and it was all about, at that time, the 80th anniversary of the end of that war. The veteran I spoke with was then 102 years old. Tom Spear was his name.\n\nAnd you're right, I have talked with a lot of veterans, but this interview, it still stays with me so much, 20 years later. And that's for a few reasons.\n\nThis Sunday, on Remembrance Day, will be the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. All of the veterans of that war are now all gone. But in cases, their words and their memories do live on. CBC reporter Scott Dippel is here with a story of his own memory of talking with a veteran of the Great War. 7:00\n\nHere was a guy who was 102 years old, he was extremely spry. As I discovered sitting there interviewing him in his kitchen at his house in southwest Calgary, his memory of everything in his life was so incredibly sharp. But what was also so memorable for me about this interview was he told me about the story of the day the war ended, on Nov. 11, 1918.\n\nQ: So set the stage for us, what was Tom Spear doing at the end of the war?\n\nA: Tom Spear was in the Canadian Signal Corps and he was a telegrapher. Part of his duties included doing shifts in a special truck that was obviously mobile, moving about behind the front lines. So he and his colleague would spend time in that truck, sending and receiving coded messages. In early November 1918, they were near Valenciennes, France.\n\nQ: What happened on that last day of the war for this soldier?\n\nA: Spear says he and the other soldier were in that special truck, one of them receiving messages from other signallers, and they were passing them along. So it was early in the morning on November 11th 1918, the message of the armistice came in.\n\nSo Spear read me the message his comrade received and he then passed along to other units. This was the message that ultimately ended the war.\n\nQ: What did he say it was like to be receiving that message?\n\nA: On one hand, Spear said it was elation as it meant the fighting would soon stop, but he was working feverishly to share that message with other Canadian units.\n\nBut it was also a very bittersweet moment for Tom Spear. He says just a few days before the armistice, he had found out that his older brother William had been killed in a German machine-gun attack just a few weeks prior to this. And it was a very emotional moment.\n\nI recall in our interview how he teared up, remembering his brother had died more than 80 years before the day we spoke. But I think it's safe to say it was a very profound day in his life. He remembered so many details of that day.\u2026 I asked him about the weather, and he said, \"well, it was a very bright, sunny day.\"\n\nTom Spear died in September 2000, just shy of his 104th birthday.\n\nWith files from The Homestretch.", "When Lane Edwards was spending hours in her home laboratory, crafting the first products for her skincare line Pura Botanicals, she was blasting her favourite band, Fleetwood Mac, for inspiration.\n\n\"They were the soundtrack,\" Edwards told CBC's Radio Active.\n\nShe even crafted her very first product as a homage to Stevie Nicks.\n\n\"I was inspired by her ethereal, mythical, witchy energy,\" said Edwards. \"Every single note was inspired by her essence and energy.\"\n\nJohn McVie and Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac perform on stage at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Oct. 6, 2014 (Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)\n\nLittle did she know that just four years later, Nicks would become a big fan of Pura Botanicals, too.\n\nThat first product was a sandalwood, rosewood and vanilla-infused perfume mist. Edwards had wanted to call it Gold Dust Woman, after the 1977 song from the album, Rumours. But wary of copyright laws, she went with the Fleetwood-inspired Zingara Gypsy Mist, instead.\n\nFast-forward to 2018. Edwards runs her all-natural line \u2014 37 products including face masks, cleansers and rejuvenating serums \u2014 out of her flagship boutique on 124th Street. Until recently, she had no idea that someone in Fleetwood Mac's inner circle had been following her company's progress.\n\nBut two months ago she got a message from a woman named Sole Weller.\n\n\"It was a Monday morning, and I got this message directly through Instagram and I had to read it over about 10 times,\" said Edwards.\n\n\"I looked at her profile to see if it was real, and of course\u2026 right on her website it says she's Fleetwood Mac's health coach.\"\n\nPura Botanicals' first-ever product, Zingara Gypsy Mist, was inspired by Stevie Nicks. (Lane Edward )\n\nWeller told Edwards that she does a lot of facials for the band in their hotel rooms and a lot of self-care for them during air travel. Specifically, she was interested in Pura's overnight mask collection.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, Edwards curated a bunch of products for the band, and timed a shipment to arrive at their next hotel. Fleetwood Mac is currently on a world tour, arriving in Edmonton Saturday.\n\nThe bounty was a hit.\n\n\"They got the products and touched base with us and said they were beyond amazing and nourishing and everybody loves them,\" said Edwards.\n\n\"They said, 'we're always on the move, so we're going to be making frequent orders because we can't have too much with us.\"\n\nThe universe aligned for Fleetwood Mac to find Pura Botanicals, but it's not all dumb luck. There are major similarities between brand and band.\n\nIt was important for Fleetwood Mac to \"connect with an all-natural luxury brand,\" said Edwards.\n\n\"We're such a magical, celestial brand as well \u2014 that was the connection point. We're so aligned with their music and lyrics\u2026 Stevie is so witchy and we always say we're the good witches of Edmonton; what we do here is alchemy. For us, it's just amazing to be looking after them.\"\n\nAnd if it wasn't enough to be the official skincare brand for Fleetwood Mac's world tour, Edwards is going to the show Saturday with Weller, who will visit her at the boutique first. She's also bringing her daughter, Morgan \u2014 who's already a big Fleetwood Mac fan, at age 9.\n\n\"It's just surreal to think that we're an Edmonton beauty brand,\" said Edwards.\n\n\"They're from Los Angeles \u2014 that's the Mecca of beauty brands. We're so isolated here in Edmonton, and we have to work three times as hard\u2026. They could have picked anyone. It's just so amazing that we're here.\"", "For the first time in years, Royal Canadian Legion La Verendrye Branch No. 220 will not hold a Remembrance Day ceremony this Sunday.\n\nAnd there won't be any in the future, either \u2014 the La Verendrye Legion branch, in the small town of Ste.

The Games may even be the jolt we need to shake off the weariness of a prolonged economic downturn,\n\nAnd, hell, even have some fun.\n\nBut before hope, there must be good economics.\n\nFor the Olympic and Paralympic Games to provide a boost for Calgary, first, the Games need to make good financial sense.\n\nWhat are we buying?\n\nOur just-released report looked at the dollars-and-cents case for a bid, including what it would cost to spruce up the Olympic Oval, build affordable housing and accommodate tens of thousands of visitors from around the world in our own backyard.\n\nWe also looked at scarier stuff \u2014 like the potential for cost overruns \u2014 that puts chills down the spines of Calgarians concerned about the bottom line.\n\nWe determined the finances of the proposed Calgary 2026 Winter Games bid are sound. To reach this conclusion, we looked at the social and economic impact of the Games.\n\nWe did an exhaustive analysis of what's been written about Olympic spending \u2014 including the good, the bad and the ugly. Our report found good measures are in place to prevent cost overruns (like a billion-dollar contingency fund).\n\nWe found the bid has a responsible budget for what it plans to spend money on, and there would be some modest financial gains: $1.5 billion for Calgary, $2 billion for Alberta. Olympics spending isn't just money out the window.\n\nDollars and cents have dominated discussion of the bid, and that makes sense. For a city still coming out of tough times, it's important to make sure the economics are sensible.\n\nThere's a sense that the Games are spending on \"circuses, not bread,\" at a time when many Albertans are struggling with their own budgets and the province itself is in deficit.\n\nBut almost the entire \"month-long party\" part of the Games is set to be paid for by private sponsors and the International Olympic Committee. The money that comes from taxpayers would be spent on long-term investments that will stay in Calgary for decades after the Games wrap up.\n\nIn other words, private money pays for the \"circus\" and public money pays for the \"bread.\"\n\nThe \"bread,\" in this case, includes upgrading sports infrastructure and badly needed affordable housing. Two new facilities \u2014 a fieldhouse and mid-sized arena \u2014 would also be built.\n\nBut there's value beyond the bricks and mortar.\n\nThe value of what can't be measured\n\nOne of the challenging parts of studying an Olympic bid is considering all the things that come with the Games that can't be counted or measured.\n\nIn other words, we're buying things that are nearly impossible to put financial value on, like personal and community benefits. It may be difficult to put a price on some of these, but they still have great value.\n\nIn an era of \"us versus them\" politics, provincial and federal fights over pipelines and pinot noir, the Games are an opportunity to get along. A chance to remember that there is far more that unites us than divides us. To remind ourselves how lucky we are to be Calgarians, Albertans, Canadians.\n\nTo get a sense of what this means, think of your favourite moment from the Vancouver 2010 Games. Can you still remember how it made you feel?\n\nOne of our favourite moments was when Alexandre Bilodeau won the first gold medal for Canada and celebrated alongside his brother. Just thinking about it gives us goosebumps.\n\nAlexandre Bilodeau celebrates his gold medal win at the men's mogul at Cypress Mountain in Vancouver, B.C., at the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\n\nCalgary can put on a Games to be proud of. The Olympics can inspire Calgarians. Putting the best parts of the city on display not only shows the world how great Calgary is, but reminds Calgarians of it, too.\n\nThe Games will also rally a new corps of volunteers to step up as a new generation of community leaders, who, once the Games have come and gone, will continue to shape Calgary for decades to come.\n\nPerhaps most importantly \u2014 and most difficult to measure \u2014 is a return of hope, optimism, and confidence to the city.\n\nLet's face it. As a city, we're feeling pretty beaten up.\n\nSo, what if we say \"no\" to the Olympics? What if we decide that the big economic and social undertakings are too hard, too expensive and too risky for us to handle? That, perhaps, it is better to play it small. Less reward, but less risk, too.\n\nThis is not the Calgary that we used to live in. And it's not the Calgary we live in today.\n\nTo Calgarians who cast their ballot in the plebiscite on Nov. 13, we say this: Think about the economics, but also think about what can't be measured.\n\nThis column is an opinion.

The committee was created by the current Liberal government in response to persistent demands for greater civilian oversight of intelligence work in this country.\n\nWhile its work is carefully guarded, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale promised the committee would have \"extraordinary access to scrutinize all of the security and intelligence operations\" across the government of Canada.\n\nBlackmail targets\n\nAfter receiving the clearance required to delve into any matter related to national security, the members also received a comprehensive security briefing from the Privy Council Office and other security agencies.\n\nThat briefing included warnings that members of this committee \u2014 which reviews information highly coveted by the nation's enemies and other foreign actors \u2014 could be the targets of blackmail or extortion attempts, a spokesperson for the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) said in a statement to CBC News.\n\n\"That briefing included a detailed presentation on the ways in which committee members may be targeted due to their presence on the committee,\" said Rennie Marcoux, executive director of the committee.\n\n\"Our legislation and regulation clearly set out our security and confidentiality requirements. We regularly review these obligations given how important this is to our credibility and relations with the security and intelligence community.\"\n\nDespite this commitment to \"regularly review\" security and confidentiality requirements, Clement continued to sit as a member of this committee months after telling the Ontario Provincial Police that an \"inappropriate exchange\" with a woman online may have left him exposed.\n\nSteve Waterhouse, a former information systems security officer at the Department of National Defence and now an expert in cybersecurity, said he believes the vetting process for this committee needs to be even more rigorous than it already is to guard against someone vulnerable to blackmail being made privy to state secrets.\n\nWaterhouse said it isn't enough to simply vet someone before they become a member of the committee.\n\nIf a police report is filed that involves a member of the committee \u2014 as it was with Clement \u2014 that information should be made available to the committee's leadership, he said.\n\n\"Members serving on these committees should be continuously reviewed and the government should monitor their online activities. They should sign a waiver saying, 'Yes, my private life isn't private anymore. The government has an overview of whatever I'm talking about or exchanging online,'\" Waterhouse said.\n\n\"When national security and state security is involved, that should supercede the privacy of an individual with privileged information.\"\n\nMarcoux said the committee \"pays a lot of attention to its security obligations. We discuss them on an ongoing basis.\"\n\n'Personal difficulty and weakness'\n\nIn a letter to constituents published Thursday, Clement said that, during a period of \"personal difficulty and weakness,\" he engaged in a sexually explicit exchange with a woman online in the summer of 2018.\n\n\"One inappropriate exchange led to a woman being offered money by an anonymous social media account in exchange for the disclosure of intimate and personal information,\" Clement said.\n\nHe reported this incident to the Ontario Provincial Police. The force confirmed to CBC News that Clement did come to the OPP with a complaint in the summer and an investigation was launched. The OPP would not say if the investigation is ongoing.\n\nCBC News asked multiple government department officials \u2014 including people at the Privy Council Office (the arm of the bureaucracy that serves the prime minister, cabinet and the work of this committee) and the NSICOP national director \u2014 when they became aware of Clement's complaint to the OPP regarding the extortion attempt. They all refused to state when exactly they learned of the OPP's involvement.\n\nClement only resigned from his position on the committee this week, after he went public with the details of another act of infidelity that led to an extortion attempt for money.\n\n'Foreign actors'\n\nIn that case, Clement reported the incident to the RCMP, sent a statement to the press and resigned from all of his parliamentary positions.\n\nClement has said he believes this second, most recent incident was carried out by \"foreign actors.\" The RCMP has launched an investigation.\n\nThere is no indication that Clement was asked for or disclosed any sensitive information. In his letter to constituents, Clement said: \"I want to be clear that at no time have these personal lapses impacted or involved my day to day work as a Member of Parliament on behalf of our communities.\"\n\nWaterhouse said Clement would now be the subject of an extensive \"impact assessment\" by the police to make sure Clement did not disclose anything of value to the extortionists.\n\nWaterhouse said it's entirely conceivable that a country like Russia would pursue Clement because of his prominent position on the committee \u2014 and also because of his vocal defence of Ukraine in the face of Russian incursions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.\n\nHe said foreign operatives often seek out officials like Clement: a politician easily accessible online with a robust social media presence. Clement follows tens of thousands of people on Twitter and Instagram.\n\n\"He had access to privileged information. It makes him a very interesting subject,\" Waterhouse said. \"There's a delicate balance between being an easily accessible politician and accepting everyone who wants to follow you.\"", "Looking to avoid a repeat of last winter's shelter crisis, the city unveiled three 24-hour respite sites in the downtown area to tackle a system bursting at the seams.\n\n\"Last year's long stretch of extremely cold weather, coupled with a rising demand for shelter changed our team's approach to planning for this winter,\" Paul Raftis, manager of the city's shelter, support and housing division, said during a news conference Friday.\n\nToronto's shelter system is currently at a 93 per cent occupancy rate.\n\nThe most recent numbers show roughly 560 people were staying across the city's nine respite sites and women's drop-ins as of Friday, with more than 6,500 people using the shelter system.\n\nConstruction is underway on a 24-hour temporary shelter in the parking lot of Allan Lamport Stadium. (CBC)\n\nCity staff have started work on three large prefabricated structures that will function as respite centres. Two are capable of housing 100 people each, while the third has a capacity of 80.\n\nBuilt out of durable fabric and fibreglass on an aluminum frame, the tented pop-up structures are insulated and can be used year-round with plumbing, showers, toilets, laundry facilities, dining areas, cots, televisions and administrative offices.\n\nThe city is spending $7.5 million to construct the sites, plus other support costs, according to Raftis.\n\nHere is where the temporary respite sites are and when they're slated to open:\n\nAllan Lamport Stadium Park at 1155 King St. W. will open on Dec. 15.\n\nThe Gore at 701 Fleet St. will open on Jan. 31, 2019.\n\n351 Lake Shore Blvd. E. will open Jan. 31, 2019.\n\nUntil they're ready, the city has set up 200 temporary beds at Exhibition Place. The temporary site opens next week.\n\nThis digital rendering shows how the inside of a tented structure will look once it's built. Each structure will cost the city $2.5 million and can house up to 100 people. (Supplied by City of Toronto)\n\nRaftis admits the city faced \"operational and communication challenges\" last year, but says he's encouraged that staff are already working on improving the system. He noted, that this is the fifth consecutive year the city has beefed up spaces for the homeless.\n\nAt least 600 shelter beds will be available next Thursday when the 24-hour winter respite sites open \u2014 that's 150 more than previous years, Raftis said.\n\n\"We believe we're bringing on additional programs and spaces to manage the demand,\" he said. \"We also have other contingencies available to us this year, should the demand dramatically rise.\"\n\nRapid increase in demand\n\nLast December, city council voted down a call to open two local armouries, only to see the Moss Park facility opened to the public months later after a huge public outcry.\n\nMeanwhile, Toronto Public Health data showed close to 100 homeless people died in Toronto in 2017. That's nearly two deaths per week.\n\nHealth-care workers attacked the conditions inside emergency respite centres, saying many of the shelters didn't have mattresses to sleep on, which doesn't meet the city's standard.\n\nIn early December, council voted down a call to open two local armouries, only to see the Moss Park facility opened to the public months later after a huge public outcry. (Canadian Press)\n\nToronto's ombudsman also blasted the city's handling of the shelter crisis in a report released last March. Susan Opler found city officials provided \"outdated, inaccurate and inconsistent\" information, confirming the claims of homeless advocates who sounded the alarm about people being turned away from some facilities.\n\nDuring the course of her investigation, Opler made 18 recommendations to improve services \u2014 including developing a new system to track the occupancy inside winter respites. Opler also recommended the city consult with those using the respite centres to see how they can be improved in future.\n\n\"Last winter was a very unique experience for the city \u2014 two full weeks of extreme cold weather is something we hadn't experienced in awhile,\" said Raftis.\n\nHe said the frigid weather combined with a rapid increase in demand led to the crisis.\n\n\"We hadn't seen those numbers the previous year,\" he said.\n\nCity developing fixes\n\nThe city is responding to that and has started public consultations with communities around the new respite centres.\n\n\"The plan is informed by last winter's experience and supported by recommendations from the city's ombudsman,\" said Raftis.\n\nCity staff have built an improved strategy that features updated information hotline in a new call centre on Church Street to accurately handle a predicted volume of calls for service.\n\n\"When people call in they can take those calls more efficiently,\" Raftis explained.\n\nExtra staff have also been added to the central intake team and a duty officer will oversee how the shelter system is managed and identify any challenges.\n\nAround 100 more shelter beds are also planned to open in December, Raftis said.", "Calgary-East MLA Robyn Luff is challenging Premier Rachel Notley and Official Opposition Leader Jason Kenney to put their jobs on the line and resign if an independent investigation finds any of their MLAs have been bullied.\n\nIn a letter released Friday, the former NDP caucus member challenged Notley's statement on Thursday that Luff's allegations of bullying and intimidation had no foundation.\n\nLuff wants Notley to conduct a workplace bullying investigation where all MLAs in the legislature could testify anonymously about their experiences.\n\n\"If no NDP MLAs report a culture of fear and intimidation ... then I will resign,\" Luff wrote.\n\n\"And because the premier is so sure and confident that this is not occurring in her caucus, when the independent inquiry is published, and if any foundation for my experience is corroborated, then I'm asking her to agree to resign.\"\n\nLuff said United Conservative Party Leader Jason Kenney should also resign if anyone in his caucus reports feeling fear or experiencing bullying.\n\n\"Let's let every MLA have an anonymous opportunity to tell their experiences with the protection of an independent third party right now,\" Luff wrote.\n\n\"Rachel Notley and Jason Kenney should welcome this.

The 7,000 smallest employers in the province will be forking over an additional $700 each.\n\nThe chamber blames the \"out-of-control\" increases on legislative changes in 2015 that gave the Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal policy-making authority.\n\nThe tribunal began overturning WorkSafeNB decisions on compensation, creating retroactive costs and forcing the board to raise premiums.\n\nIn July, an independent task force made up of employers and workers recommended the province amend the legislation so that tribunal rulings are no longer \"of a general nature\" and apply only to the individual worker's case.\n\nIt also said the tribunal should not have the power \"to alter, vary, reverse or amend\" any WorkSafeNB policy but only to \"bring to the attention of WorkSafeNB\" policies that need changing.\n\nLegislation this fall\n\nHiggs, who was sworn in as premier on Friday, has said his government will introduce legislation this fall that may come in two phases and wouldn't be quick enough to avoid the Jan. 1 increase. But it might allow rates to come back down two or three months into 2019.\n\nRoss said the chamber is \"very encouraged\" to hear Higgs says it's a high priority for his government. The business organization that represents nearly 1,000 members had talked to all parties prior to the election about the importance of the issue.\n\nWithout legislative intervention by the government, the chamber fears rates will continue to climb.\n\n\"We want to look after injured workers,\" Ross said. \"That's the priority, that's what this system is for, but it also has to be sustainable. It has to have a cost structure that's affordable.\"\n\nThe rate increase since 2016 is \"beyond acceptable,\" she said. \"It's increased 163 per cent. Nothing should increase that much in that short of a time.\"\n\nKrista Ross, CEO of the Fredericton Chamber of Commerce, explains what increased premiums will mean to the business community. 7:04\n\nShe points to WorkSafeNB's own statistics, which indicate workplaces across the province are becoming safer.

How are they dying? Why does it keep happening?\n\nWe started by collecting data on fatal crashes from police forces across the region. That took months.\n\nThen, with the help of CBC's reference library, we combed through hundreds of news clippings about each crash and obituaries of people who died.\n\nCBC News analyzed reams of data and spoke with dozens of families. Here are the stories of just five families who lost loved ones in ATV and snowmobile crashes. 24:56\n\nWe also talked to as many families as possible.\n\nWe found that at least 178 people have died on ATVs and snowmobiles across Atlantic Canada since 2012. (That doesn't include people who have been badly injured, like Nova Scotia's Johnny Kenyon.)\n\nMore than 178 Atlantic Canadians have died on recreational vehicles since 2012. (Trevor Lyons )\n\nWe found the majority of victims were middle-aged men. They most often died between the hours of 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n\nAbout a quarter of victims died in rollover crashes and another quarter died after crashing into trees or stationary objects.\n\nAnd those who died left behind grieving family members.\n\nSome provincial governments have started looking for solutions, but the problems are complex.\n\nIf you have ideas on how to make the sport safer, please email NBInvestigates@CBC.ca.\n\nTory cabinet\n\nProgressive Conservative Premier Blaine Higgs and his cabinet ministers were sworn into office Friday, and provincial affairs reporter Jacques Poitras breaks down the unveiled cabinet, which features plenty of new faces and leaves out some veteran politicians.\n\nNew Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs, centre, stands with the members of the executive council on Friday.

A day earlier, PC Leader Blaine Higgs said that permitting fracking in specific areas is a compromise approach to the divisive issue.\n\nBut is there a willingness to frack in the area surrounding Sussex and Penobsquis?

Both Fredericton locations were closed, prompting some consumers to return to illegal dispensaries. Cannabis NB employees also missed out of shifts during the closures.\n\nThe Crown corporation that runs the stores pointed the finger at producers for failing to meet its initial order by 80 per cent.

Hudson said Friday an estimated 20 players were plucked from the ranks of the remaining teams in the Keystone Junior Hockey League, including four from Peguis.\n\nThe First Nations are seeking damages for alleged breaches of contracts with players.

The court documents say the governing body ruled KJHL players had to get a release to register in the new league and pay a $500 fee.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Hockey Manitoba failed to enforce that decision.\n\nHockey Manitoba executive director Peter Woods said Friday he wouldn't comment on the case while it's before the courts.

They also expressed unhappiness over the fees awarded to the lawyers who negotiated the deal.\n\nLaskin noted the applicants had failed to show they were survivors of the '60s Scoop and therefore members of the class. Nor did they provide evidence that an appeal of the settlement would be in the best interests of survivors, he said.\n\nSeeking legal costs\n\nOne of the applicants, Joan Frame, of Hamilton, had alleged to The Canadian Press that the lawyers who negotiated the settlement \u2014 some of whom worked on the case for free for the better part of a decade \u2014 \"resorted to trickery\" to get the agreement.\n\n\"To allow people to win illegally and make money off our backs and suffering again should not be allowed to happen,\" Frame had said.\n\nLaskin also took issue with such assertions, saying the applicants had offered no evidence in support.\n\nWhile it is normal in litigation for the losing party to be on the hook for the legal costs incurred by the winners, the winning lawyers are seeking costs personally from the lawyer who filed the appeal motion given the serious misconduct allegations he made against them.\n\n\u200b\n\nLaskin declined to award costs until Jai Singh Sheikhupura with Vancouver-based Watson Goepel has had an opportunity to make submissions.

All of them are trying to find a way to navigate their own lives and healing \u2014 and their relationships with each other \u2014 in a world that doesn't seem to understand them, know how to help them or even believe them at times.\n\nIn its Prairie Theatre Exchange production (a local debut for Sinha, an award-winning playwright living in Toronto who was born in Winnipeg), the somewhat ironically named Happy Place proves to be an intense and insightful exploration of human frailty \u2014 and how difficult we find it to respond to that.\n\nFeaturing a powerhouse cast of seven (mostly local performers, all turning in impressive performances), it tells the story of a group of women in an in-patient care facility. The multi-generational, multi-ethnic cast suggests that these seven women could be any woman.\n\nHappy Place features a powerhouse cast of seven.

(Leif Norman/PTE)\n\nIt's not a particularly happy place on the surface \u2014 hence the hint of irony in the title. But there's a sincerity in it too, in that each of the characters here seems to be genuinely searching for that elusive \"happy place.\"\n\nSome have experienced trauma, including sexual assault, while others struggle with depression. In some cases, Sinha leaves their reasons for being in the facility somewhat ambiguous, frustrating our natural impulse to label people, but underscoring the point that it's the person \u2014 not their diagnosis \u2014 that should be our focus.\n\nThe central character is Samira (Darla Contois), a survivor of a brutal sexual assault who is still intent on finding the man who raped her, even as she tries to find a way to live with the aftermath of the assault.\n\nBut Happy Place isn't a whodunit or a play about being \"cured\" of trauma or mental illness \u2014 it's not much of a spoiler to say there are no pat \"happily ever afters\" for the characters here \u2014 nor is this a narrative-driven play (those searching for linear plot will be frustrated).\n\nRather, it's a play that explores, in a series of short scenes showing the interactions of the seven women, what it's like to be damaged and hurt, and the challenge that comes with fitting into the world when you have been.\n\nChallenging but surprisingly funny\n\nFor its sombre subject matter, it is surprisingly funny at points (\"You can't put a bunch of women together and have it not be funny,\" Sinha told CBC in an interview last year). Most of that humour comes from the characters \u2014 distinct and recognizable, though never caricaturish.\n\nThere's Mildred (a delightfully crusty Megan McArton), easily annoyed but quick with a dirty joke; Nina (an achingly vulnerable Alicia Johnston), gentle and well-intentioned if indefinably odd; the combative and uptight Celine (Paula Potosky); and hyper-competitive Joyce (Jan Skene, a marvel of cheerful passive aggression).\n\nThey're joined by \"new girl\" Rosemary (Hazel Venzon), and brought together by the compassionate but cooly professional therapist, Louise (Daina Leitold, bringing impressive depth to what could be a one-note character).\n\nThe central character in Happy Place is Samira (Darla Contois, left, with Daina Leitold as Louise). Samira is a survivor of a brutal sexual assault who is intent on finding the man who raped her, even as she tries to find a way to live with the aftermath of the assault. (Leif Norman/PTE)\n\nEach woman has her own story. We discover them to varying degrees, in fits and starts \u2014 and while it never quite feels like we know any of them fully, it's a testament to Sinha's writing that we feel we recognize them.\n\nIn his local directorial debut, PTE's new artistic director, Thomas Morgan Jones, delivers a steady and assured production that lets the talent in the cast shine.\n\nIt is, though, perhaps a little too steady at times. It feels there are points here where a certain spark doesn't quite take, and some of the back-and-forth dialogue between the women seems like it should have a bit more snap to it.\n\nAnd while she delivers some heart-wrenching moments, particularly in her therapy scenes with Louise, it sometimes feels Contois's take on Samira is perhaps a bit too understated.\n\nFor its sombre subject matter, Happy Place is surprisingly funny at points. Most of that humour comes from the characters \u2014 distinct and recognizable, though never caricaturish. (Leif Norman/PTE)\n\nIt's hard, ultimately, to say audiences will leave Happy Place \u2014 a challenging piece of theatre \u2014 \"happy,\" exactly.\n\nBut you might leave with the understanding that Sinha's characters seem to come to: perhaps happiness doesn't rest on perfection, and there may be a certain measure of it to be found in the small victories in the struggle.\n\nSometimes, maybe that's as happy a place as we can expect to find.\n\nHappy Place runs at Prairie Theatre Exchange until Nov. 25.", "Hundreds of people gathered Friday afternoon to remember a terminally ill Halifax woman whose fight to loosen assisted dying laws captured national attention as she dispensed wisdom about life from the \"bed of truth\" where she spent her last days.\n\nA \"celebration of life\" was held for Audrey Parker at Pier 21 on the city's waterfront, with more than 300 people in attendance to pay their respects to the charismatic makeup artist.\n\nThe gathering at the hall overlooking the harbour included family members, friends and people from the general public who'd been touched by her struggle.\n\nHer circle of close female friends in attendance ranged from the Nova Scotia premier's principal secretary, the president of Credit Union Atlantic, and nationally known broadcasters.\n\nStep-daughter recalls final visits\n\nMany had sat around what Parker referred to as her \"bed of truth,\" where she dispensed advice during her final months, instructing visitors on everything from how to use cutlery through essentials on how to choose a suitable mate.\n\nHer step-daughter Lucie MacMaster said times spent with her were precious, recalling how her children would often hop into bed to play cards with Parker during her illness.\n\n\"I really wish we had her with us this Christmas, but there we go,\" said MacMaster.\n\nKim King, 51, a close friend of Parker's who was with her as she was dying, was one of the honorary pallbearers who carried a candle up to the front of the Pier 21 hall where the ceremony was held.\n\n\"People are inspired by her thoughts about living your best life to the end,\" she said in an interview.\n\nParker planned own celebration\n\nEvery detail of the gathering was planned by Parker, said master of ceremonies Nancy Regan, recalling how they talked about it over champagne and chocolate-dipped strawberries at a meeting at Pier 21.\n\n\"I know she has a huge smile on her face right now about the gorgeous women who showed up today,\" said Regan. \"Everything about Audrey was swirling perfection.\"\n\nParker ended her life with a doctor's assistance on Nov. 1, but said under amended legislation she might have lived for weeks longer.\n\nDiagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer in 2016, the 57-year-old woman had been approved for an assisted death.\n\nFought for legal change until the end\n\nShe used her case to plead with lawmakers, stressing the law had to be changed because it demands people approved for a medically assisted death must be conscious and mentally sound at the moment they grant their final consent for a lethal injection.\n\nFederal cabinet ministers have said they feel strong sympathy towards Parker and her family, but they remain confident in the federal legislation.\n\nJustice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould has said Ottawa feels the two-year-old legislation strikes the appropriate balance between the protection of people's autonomy and safeguards for vulnerable people.\n\nThe issue will be among those considered in a report being drafted by a panel of experts, which is due by the end of the year but is not expected to make recommendations\n\nParker was given a lethal injection and died peacefully in her Halifax apartment.\n\nBeing 'Audreyed'\n\nNorma Lee MacLeod, a retired broadcaster, said encounters with the dynamic Parker were often unforgettable \u2014 as she tended to sweep forcefully into a room and had the knack of making people feel good about themselves.\n\n\"She could transform you from a puffy mess ...

We've been Audreyed and we're the better for it,\" she said.\n\nDifferent illness, different situation\n\nHilary Young, an associate professor of law at the University of New Brunswick, said one area where Parker's death may remain significant is in the discussion of whether lawmakers will have to make distinctions between diseases in terms of when advance directives are permitted.\n\nShe said she personally agrees with Parker's argument that when doctors have assessed and approved a medically assisted death like hers, it could be left to her written instructions or a substitute decision-maker as to when it occurs.\n\nHowever, she said that may be less applicable to people with dementia, or in some other instances.\n\n\"I think Audrey Parker's case has brought to light the distinction between different kinds of advance directives.

Krause says she's not part of any political party, industry or campaign, and works from her own home in Vancouver.\n\nShe says her research suggests the U.S.-based Tar Sands Campaign may have the overall goal of protecting the environment, but its efforts have had no impact on reducing global oil use \u2014 and is hurting Canada in the process, she contends.\n\nKrause sat down with the Calgary Eyeopener ahead of her talk Friday night at Mount Royal University in Calgary called The Cause of Oil Price Discounts.\n\nThe interview has been edited for content and clarity.\n\nQ. What do you think is behind the Keystone XL pipeline court case in the U.S.?\n\nA. I think it's clear that this is another result of an effort [that's] been running for 10 years now, tens of millions of dollars have gone into a campaign. It's called the Tar Sands Campaign.\n\nAnybody who wants to learn more about it can just Google it. You can go to the website of an organization called Corporate Ethics in San Francisco and they will tell you about the campaign.\n\nI've been following the money on this for eight years. When I first started, it wasn't clear what it was all about, but now it is. The individual who has been running this campaign now for a decade, he says online that from the very beginning, the campaign strategy was to landlock the tarsands so they could not reach international markets where it could get a high price per barrel.\n\nQ. To what end?\n\nA. I think if you were to ask the people involved with this, they would tell you this is about saving the climate. From their point of view, that's their goal. But if you read the strategy paper, they're quick themselves to recognize transportation fuels is just a small part of carbon emissions and Canada is just a minuscule part of global carbon emissions.\n\nMy take on it is, we can all agree there is a lot of scope for improvement in how we use oil. We burn 1,000 barrels of oil every second, So, renewable energy, more energy efficiency, getting more kilometres out of every barrel, and energy security, those are the main goals of the funders and I think we can all agree on all of that.\n\nVivian Krause is a B.C.-based researcher whose work for better part of the last decade has focused on highlighting the connection between U.S. charitable foundations and the environmental movement in Canada. (Vivian Krause/Facebook)\n\nBut they have a fourth goal, and that goal is to push Canada out of the global oil market, and that's the one I think we can disagree on because it doesn't help the environment: it just means the oil gets produced by other countries instead of Canada.\n\nQ. From your work, where do you think the money is coming from that funds these campaigns?\n\nA. It's very clear where the money is coming from because it says so on the tax returns. What's happening is there's a group of charitable foundations and they have endowments, the Hewlett Foundation, for example, has $9 billion, so every year they give away about $400 million, just off the interest and investment income.\n\nThose foundations, they put money into intermediary funders, the Tides Foundation in San Francisco and the New Venture Fund in Washington D.C., those are the two main ones. And those intermediaries, they dish out the money to more than 100 groups in Canada and the U.S. and in Europe that are all a part of this effort called the Tar Sands Campaign.\n\nQ. Are there U.S. oil interests or Russian or Middle East oil interests involved in the campaign?\n\nA. To be honest, I don't think so. We need to understand the history of how this campaign evolved and who is funding it. There are a combination of interests here, there's not just one objective. Part of it is environmental, I'm convinced these funders truly, genuinely are concerned about the environmental impacts of oil and I think we all should be.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing charitable about bullying Canada out of the global oil market - Vivian Krause\n\nBut there is more to it than that. The same group of funders that began this campaign have been trying to achieve energy independence and get the U.S. off of [Middle East] oil. That's what I would call the elephant in the room \u2014 the geopolitics of oil.\n\nQ. What do you say to people who say, so what? It's not as if the oil patch is some under-funded group that doesn't have the billions of dollars behind themselves to fight the same cases. This campaign and its funding just levels the playing field.\n\nA. The oil industry is plenty big enough to fight its own battles and I think unfortunately, they underestimated the powerfulness of activism. That, I think, is changing.\n\nBut here's the thing: anybody who cares about the environment needs to think about this campaign because this campaign is not helping the environment \u2014 we've now got oil going by truck, some 900 trucks are out there trucking around oil on our roads.\n\nCanadian researcher Vivian Krause has spent years tracking the cash that funds anti-pipeline activism. She has written several reports, claiming there is a \"directed campaign\" by U.S. funders against Alberta oil. She speak to the CBC Eyeopener's David Gray. 8:21\n\nAnd what has happened over the last few years is we're not using any less oil because of this campaign. In fact, because of the oil price war, we're using more oil. People are buying bigger trucks, taking longer vacations, driving more kilometres per year.\n\nSo this campaign has had no effect, none, on reducing our use of oil. All it has done is add a whack load of debt onto Alberta, weaken Canada and instead of enabling us to make more of a contribution to addressing to what truly are global challenges. We are able to do less, so how does that help the environment?\n\nQ. What drives you in your work?\n\nA. This fell in my lap, I have a very unusual combination of experience \u2014 I know the charitable sector, I worked with United Nations for a decade, I was trained to avoid corruption, which is what actually got me started.\n\nMost of my work has nothing to do with activism, it's about corruption and that's where I saw that this campaign is not charity. There is absolutely nothing charitable about bullying Canada out of the global oil market.

Pending council approval next week, Klein will be the fifth chair of the police board since it was created during former mayor Sam Katz's final term.\n\nKlein will succeed former St. James Coun. Scott Fielding, North Kildonan Coun. Jeff Browaty, St. James Coun. Scott Gillingham and Asper, the only non-elected official to assume the role.\n\nUnder Asper's leadership, the police board streamlined its oversight of the Winnipeg Police Service. Council reduced the number of public and private meetings held by the board, which also rescinded several policies it approved under previous chairs.\n\nAsper said the provincial legislation governing police boards is ambiguous and said he tried to interpret that legislation to the best of his ability in order to restrict the board's scope.\n\n\"If you try to know what's going on, it's like drinking from a fire hose,\" Asper said at city hall. \"It's not within the jurisdiction of the police board to fill a legislative gap.\"\n\nKlein said he hopes to replicate what he described as Asper's success.\n\n\"He brought a calmness to the board. He brought a level of security to the board,\" Klein said of his predecessor.\n\nBowman said he selected Klein because the former Winnipeg Sun publisher made public safety one of his major objectives and because Klein served on the police board in Cobourg, Ont.\n\nKlein is also M\u00e9tis and thus will become Winnipeg's first Indigenous police board chair.

Right now, 70 per cent of Montreal's revenues come from property taxes. This is not acceptable, and this is the case everywhere in Quebec. But in Montreal, we have so many things we have to take care of. We didn't invest in our infrastructure for years and now we're stuck with doing all the streets at the same time, taking care of the pipes that are flooding everywhere.\n\nIn an interview with Daybreak host Mike Finnerty, Montreal Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante said she is confident with how the city chose the person they want as the next police chief, Sylvain Caron. (Verity Stevenson/CBC)\n\nTraffic woes\n\nVP: I know the situation is difficult and in some areas, it's pretty intense. Like I've said, 25 per cent of all the work we see right now comes from the City of Montreal, which means the rest of the work is being done by the private sector and the province, like the Turcot and the Champlain Bridge.\n\nAt the same time, I'm dealing with something that is bigger than me: the fact that the number of cars is growing faster than the population and this why I'm ready to fight for more public transport options. Because even without the roadwork, there are more cars all the time. The mobility squad was one of the things, but there's more being done in that file.\n\nMontreal's newly chosen police chief\n\nThe process to find a new chief unfolded quickly \u2014 on Tuesday, the mayor said a committee would start considering candidates. By Wednesday, Sylvain Caron was revealed to be the city's choice.\n\nRead more about Caron here: Montreal chooses Sylvain Caron as new police chief\n\nFinnerty asked Plante whether the speed at which Caron was chosen indicated a lack of transparency.\n\nSylvain Caron, a 30+ year veteran of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, is the City of Montreal's choice for its next police chief. (SPVM)\n\nVP: I'm standing behind our process, which is actually more transparent than ever. It's the first time a chief of police will be meeting the city's public security committee, which is now open to the public because of our administration.\n\nI feel really comfortable taking the advice of Mr. Prud'homme and choosing a chief that can continue the work he started.\n\nMF: But what does [Caron] know about Montreal? It is incredibly diverse. What does this guy know about the cultural communities, racialized minorities? How can you be sure he's the right person?\n\nVP: Well, when we did the interview, those were some of the questions that we asked. And beforehand, we looked at his CV, we went through the usual hiring process. But from the talks we've had with Mr. Caron, we're really confident. He gets it. He's been with the Montreal police for a year. He worked with Aboriginal communities in Val-d'Or.\n\nHe's sensitive about what it means to profile people based on race or social identity.

The cutline places the date of the image as Nov. 29, the day Arch died. It reads:\n\n\"Sergeant Cec Morgan of St. John's, Driver W. Fisher of Grand Falls, Signalman G.

Was he told of Arch's death hours, days or minutes after this picture was snapped?\n\nUnfortunately, I never had a chance to ask Bill those questions.\n\nBill Fisher signed up for the Second World War, according to family lore, to keep an eye on his younger brother, Arch.

Their mission was to lay telephone lines so German targets could be communicated to the regiment's guns.\n\nArch and Ron would've crossed on foot, or with mules, and struggled through deep mud in complete darkness. They would've been looking for safe places to string the telephone line, places where the wire wouldn't be cut by enemy fire or trampled by tanks.\n\nThey were, no doubt, feeling their way along an unfamiliar route that was heavily mined by the enemy.

It asserts that a \"significant majority\" of those who will try to cross the frontier in the coming weeks and months \"will not be eligible\" for the protections offered to legal refugees.\n\nUnder both U.S. and international law, people who fear persecution or torture in their home country have a right to file a claim for asylum and undergo a formal assessment, regardless of whether they do so as they arrive at the border or from inside America.\n\nPeople in a migrant caravan traveling to the U.S. struggle to cross the river from Guatemala to Mexico in Ciudad Hidalgo on Oct. 29. Under both U.S. and international law, people who fear persecution or torture in their home country have a right to file a claim for asylum and undergo a formal assessment as they arrive at the border. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nTrump's proclamation suspends that right \"for a limited period,\" in what he describes as a bid to \"channel\" migrants to legal ports of entry so that they enter the United States in an \"orderly and controlled manner,\" thereby protecting an \"overwhelmed\" immigration system.\n\nThe proclamation cites past emergency measures to stem the flow of Haitian boat people in the late 1980s and early 1990s as justification for the new ban. But the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have already labelled the rule change \"illegal,\" and indicated that they will challenge the proclamation in court.\n\nThe Trump administration is already facing a class action lawsuit over how it handles asylum claimants. The Southern Poverty Law Center says that the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has been actively trying to thwart people from making claims since early June, stationing agents on the middle of bridges to turn people away before they reach the frontier, or forcing them to wait \u2014 sometimes for days.\n\nLast week, at the crossing between Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas, one group of 20 immigrants from Cuba, Honduras, Mexico and Russia spent several days standing in the cold and rain after U.S. officials told them they were too busy to process their requests for asylum.\n\nThe ACLU is skeptical about such government claims, noting that its representatives found empty waiting rooms when they arrived at the border. It also points out that the CBP \u2014 now the largest law enforcement agency in the country \u2014 has twice the staff and budget it did 20 years ago, yet processes 1.1 million fewer people at the southern border than it did in the year 2000.\n\nMeanwhile, the migrant caravan that Trump has spent weeks campaigning against left Mexico City this morning on foot.

The last migrant caravan to the U.S. in April had dwindled to just 400 people by the time it made the border.\n\nThose who do end up presenting themselves will first have to pass a border patrol assessment of whether they have a \"credible fear\" of prosecution or torture before they can make a formal application.

Between 2007 and 2016, the U.S. has granted asylum to around 20,000 people a year on average, well below the peak 38,000 in the year 2000.\n\nIn 2016, citizens of 98 different nations were granted asylum, with the largest number \u2014 22 per cent \u2014 coming from China.\n\nAnd even as Trump continues to focus on migrants, one aspect of his plan to \"seal off\" the U.S. border has been quietly downgraded.\n\nOn Tuesday, the day of the midterms, Defense Secretary James Mattis instructed the Pentagon to stop referring to the deployment of 8,000 troops along the border as \"Operation Faithful Patriot.\"\n\nThe massing of engineers, helicopter units, military police and public affairs officials is now nameless, referred to only as \"border support.\"\n\nTrudeau, Trump and trust\n\nThe National hosted a public forum Thursday night in CBC's Toronto studio, called The National Conversation, looking at U.S.-Canada relations. One of the more notable moments for senior producer Lara Chatterjee was an exchange involving Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland talking about Justin Trudeau, Donald Trump and the issue of trust.\n\n\"What my father taught me was to trust Canadians.\"\n\nThat was the answer Justin Trudeau gave to a CNN reporter just a couple days ago when asked what he thought of his father's statement that people should trust others.\n\nIt was a clever way to test the Prime Minister on whether he trusts President Donald Trump.\n\nLast night during The National Conversation, it came up again. Aaron Blake, the senior political reporter at the Washington Post, took advantage of the opportunity to question Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister and Canada's direct diplomatic line to the White House, about Trudeau's response.\n\nThe National's public panel, The National Conversation, delved into U.S.-Canada relations. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\n\"People like me look at that quote and say hey, you were drawing a line there between President Trump and Canadians. How are we not to take that as a suggestion that he does not trust President Trump?,\" Blake asked.\n\n\"That's a question for the Prime Minister \u2026,\" Freeland answered.\n\n\"But do you trust him?,\" Rosemary Barton popped in.\n\nFreeland was cautious and careful, reaffirming the idea that the government trusts Canadians \u2014 no matter what the issue. It's something \"we discuss a lot in our cabinet meetings,\" Freeland said.\n\nBut that wasn't the question she'd been asked. So Barton took another route.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nChrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister and Canada\u2019s direct diplomatic line to the White House, responds to questions during The National Conversation panel at CBC in Toronto about whether or not Prime Minister Justin Trudeau trusts U.S. President Donald Trump. 1:20\n\nTrust is a fundamental question when two countries are so inextricably linked. The United States is Canada's largest trading partner and its largest foreign investor. You've heard all the old adages \u2014 when the United State sneezes, Canada catches a cold.\n\nOn the flip side, almost 9 million jobs in the United States depend on trade with Canada. After a contentious 13-month negotiation of the USMCA trade deal \u2014 which is not yet signed \u2014 the question of trust is a big one.\n\nThat one moment was just part of last night's wide-ranging conversation between Freeland, top Washington Post journalists Aaron Blake and Karoun Demirjian, and CBC's Rosemary Barton, Adrienne Arsenault and Keith Boag. Fake news, the challenges to democracies, the twists and blind corners of the relationship between Canada and the United States in the wake of the midterms \u2014 there was a lot to talk about.\n\nYou can watch more of The National Conversation tonight on The National on CBC Television, and an hour-long rebroadcast of the event on CBC News Network at 8 p.m. ET.

Today there are none, so understanding the long-term, reverberating impacts of the Great War is becoming more difficult.\n\nBut the effects are still there, if you know where to look.\n\nThey can be clearly seen at Three Arms, a once-mighty fishing town in Newfoundland.\n\nThe Norris family ran the community \u2014 and all its businesses. Their schooners would unload hauls of fish into their cannery, while residents wandered in and out of their store.\n\nThe town of Three Arms, seen circa 1900 when it was a thriving Newfoundland community thanks to its fishing and canning industries. (The Rooms, Provincial Archives of Newfoundland)\n\nWhen the Norris' 24-year-old son was killed in battle in Europe, the family was devastated. His father retreated from the community and shut down the businesses, sealing the town's fate.\n\nWithin a decade, most of the people were gone.\n\nEric Moore's family was the last to leave. Somewhat incredibly, the 93-year-old recent recipient of a hip replacement came with us to Three Arms by boat. It will likely be his last trip home.\n\n\"It's kind of sad now when you see it, compared to when it was alive,\" Eric told us. \"It's dead now.\"\n\nEric Moore pays his first visit in 25 years to the site of the abandoned town he grew up in, where there's little evidence left of the once-bustling fishing community. (David Common/CBC)\n\nThe town is simply gone. The forest is creeping back over the foundations of buildings and the surrounding graves of Eric's predecessors.\n\nHe'd love to have stayed in the town he grew up in, but there was no way for Three Arms to continue without the grieving Norris family.\n\n\"It would have carried on. It could have carried on, God only knows.\"\n\nWATCH: David Common's story about the Norris family and Three Arms on Sunday night's The National on CBC Television and The National on CBC Television and streamed online\n\nHow the fate of a thriving Newfoundland town was sealed by the death of a single soldier in the First World War. 0:57\n\nRemembrance Day on CBC:\n\nRosemary Barton will host CBC's Remembrance Day special coverage on Sunday, Nov. 11.\n\nWatch the special from 10 a.m. ET to noon ET on CBC News Network across the country and CBC TV in Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada.

He sold it for $20 at the local antique store Curiosity Inc.\n\nThe image got a new frame after being found in an Edmonton dumpster. (Alex Archbold)\n\nLater, the shop's owner Alex Archbold discovered it was worth a lot more than 20 bucks. So he set out to find Adam, and give him his fair share.\n\nArchbold told As It Happens host Carol Off the whole story. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nWhat do you remember about the day this man came into your shop?\n\nWell, it was not a day unlike any other. I was setting up, I was cleaning, and it's not unusual to have people walk in my store with treasures they have for sale. Adam walked in. I've seen him through the store many times before, so he's always a welcome sight.\n\nAnd what did he present to you?\n\nWhat he presented was a ratty old plastic bag with a few little treasures inside that he'd found in a dumpster. And one piece that kind of stood out was a picture of Bambi, in what was in a dirty broken frame.\n\nThe 1937 certificate of authenticity (Alex Archbold)\n\nAnd why did that stand out for you?\n\nWell, I could see that it was an animation cell, so a frame of animation that are usually hand-drawn. My first instinct was that it's probably one they replicated in the 1980s and 1990s; it's sort of an art piece. And I thought, well, maybe if I got a new frame and cleaned it up I might be able to get 80 or 100 dollars' worth. We offered him $20 and he accepted, but I had a bit of a surprise later on.\n\nHow did you discover what it was really worth?\n\nWell, the frame was in terrible shape. I mean, it had been inside the garbage. I took it out of the old frame and when I flipped it over, it had a really old certificate of authenticity. It had a copyright date of 1937 on it. And I thought, \"Well, that's pretty unusual.\" And Bambi came out in 1942. I started doing a little bit of research online and found one that was almost identical, from the same series. And I recall exactly what scene it is in the movie, and I don't know if you remember Bambi, but \u2014\n\nI do.\n\nYeah, so it's the scene where Bambi is just born and meeting his forest friends and he just meets Thumper and his family. [It's] an iconic part of the movie.\n\nAn original animation cell from Disney's 'Bambi.' (Alex Archbold)\n\nSo you figured it was worth more than the $20 you paid Adam?\n\nI wrote a gallery in the U.S. that had one, and they were asking $3,500 for theirs. And that's when I knew that I way underpaid. So I vowed that whatever I would get, I would give [Adam] half [the money].\n\nSo you put it up on eBay \u2014 what did you get for it?\n\nWe ended up selling it for $3,700 Canadian.\n\nThen you had to honour your deal, right? And give half of it to this man?\n\nGetting him the money was difficult because he has no home and no phone number. I took it upon myself to drive around town for a period of two weeks every single morning before work to try and find him. I found two of his friends; they told me that when they saw him next they would tell him to come in. And sure enough, he walked in my door.\n\nHow much money did you give him?\n\n$1,600.35, and I gave him an extra $100 and took him out for lunch.\n\nHow did he respond?\n\nHe's a very humble and nice man, and he was silent. He was tearing up a little bit. He said, \"Is this a joke? Is this for real?\" And I said, \"It's 100 per cent for real.\" He couldn't understand why I was helping him, and he even offered to give me the $100 extra back. He was such a kind guy. I think he's got great strength of character.\n\nWhat did he tell you about what he's going to do with that money?\n\nHe checked himself into a motel so he had somewhere warm to sleep that night. The next mission for him was to try and get identification. I took him to the bank and helped him get a bank account set back up. The long-term goal, and we're doing a GoFundMe for him, is to reach out to family in Ontario, get him a plane ticket, and find him a place to live so he can be safe and off the streets.\n\nWritten by Jeanne Armstrong with files from The Canadian Press.

The gold-medal edition,\" Shuster said with a smile. \"We have a lot of people who are interested in owning them.\"\n\nAfter topping the Olympic podium, Shuster's team got the brooms to match their medals. (Devin Heroux/CBC) They're certainly eye-catching. At this week's Tour Challenge Grand Slam event, where Shuster's rink started a perfect 3-0, the flashy brooms can be seen flickering in the TV lights with every sweep.\n\nMeanwhile, the colourful skip still seems to have an Olympic-sized bounce in his step. A golden swagger, if you will?\n\n\"It's not a swagger,\" Shuster insists. \"There's just no pressure anymore. I have way too much respect for the other top teams in this game.\"\n\nIt's a story many in the curling world won't forget for a long time. After an uneven start in Pyeongchang, the American team caught fire and closed with a thrilling run that included two victories over Canada before defeating Sweden to win the United States' first-ever curling gold medal. Some even dubbed it the Miracle on Ice Part 2.\n\nWhile Shuster admits to it all being somewhat magical, he doesn't really look at it as a miracle.\n\n\"We have that feather in our cap, but we won a curling tournament that just happened to be the biggest one in the world,\" he said.\n\nMore Americans than ever\n\nThough Shuster is doing his best to stay grounded after the euphoria of the Olympics, American curlers are feeling really good right now about the state of the game in their country.\n\nAnd why not? All one has to do is look out on the ice in Thunder Bay to see just how far U.S. curling has come. There are a record eight American teams playing in this week's Grand Slam.\n\n\"I don't take credit for any of this from this last Olympic cycle,\" Shuster said. \"I've been a student of the game since I first stepped on the ice years ago. Over the last five or six years I thought I could share that with our coaches and players to make sure we're doing the best practices the rest of the world is using.\"\n\nIt seems to be paying off. But as much as Shuster has done to help raise curling's profile in a country that has only recently warmed up to the game, he still thinks he has work to do.\n\nShuster's third, Tyler George, left the team during the off-season. Chris Plys has joined a foursome that's hitting the reset button in an attempt to build towards the 2022 Olympics.\n\nThis year, though, the goals are very clear.\n\n\"I want to do better in the Grand Slams,\" Shuster said. \"Winning a Slam and a world championship is still on the list. We want to enjoy curling and get Chris a national championship. He's an incredible player that hasn't won the men's national championship.\"\n\nThe goals are loftier. The confidence is at an all-time high. American curling is on the rise. This is no time to look back.\n\n\"You can't take your foot off the gas,\" Shuster said. \"You can't rest on what we've done.\"", "Construction of the new Keelesdale station along the Eglinton Crosstown LRT route is well underway, and Metrolinx opened the site to media for a sneak peek at the progress on Friday.\n\nTake a look:\n\nA look inside the main concourse of the station.

The move allows Whitaker to oversee a U.S. probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election that has hung over Trump's presidency, and which Whitaker has criticized in the past.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a career Justice Department official who has already been confirmed by the Senate, should have been named to the open position instead of Whitaker.\n\n\"You ignored the statutory line of succession,\" Schumer said in a letter to Trump released publicly on Friday.\n\n\"The appointment of Mr. Whitaker is further clouded by unresolved constitutional questions about the legality of such an action,\" Schumer said in the letter.\n\nMany people are saying <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@realDonaldTrump</a>\u2019s appointment of Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General is unconstitutional. <br> <br>Mr. President, what are you trying to hide? <a href=\"https://t.co/2FhcNAMTs2\">pic.twitter.com/2FhcNAMTs2</a> \u2014@SenSchumer\n\nAs acting attorney general, Whitaker has assumed oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which was authorized to look into \"any links and/or co-ordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a federal Appeals Court in Washington weighing a legal challenge to Mueller's authority said Friday it wanted to know whether the sudden ouster of Sessions earlier this week could impact or change the outcome of how it should rule.\n\nThe court's order directed each party in the case to file briefs by Nov. 19 outlining, \"what, if any effect, the Nov. 7, 2018, designation of an acting attorney general different from the official who appointed special counsel Mueller has on this case.\"\n\nThe order came one day after a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments on whether Mueller was unlawfully appointed by Rosenstein in May 2017 and wielded too much power.\n\nRosenstein helped launch the probe after Trump's firing of FBI Director James Comey and the recusal of Sessions into inquiries into Russia interference. Sessions had interactions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. while a Trump advocate during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.\n\n'What a stupid question that is'\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday from the White House, Trump said of the crucial appointment he made, \"I don't know Matt Whitaker.\"\n\nThe claim was greeted with skepticism, given Whitaker's frequent presence at the White House as chief of staff to Sessions.\n\n\"Matt Whitaker has a great reputation and that's why I hired him,\" the president said, pointing to the 49-year-old's time as a U.S. attorney in Iowa.\n\nTrump addressed reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Friday before departing for France. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nLast month, Trump told Fox News in an interview he knew Whitaker, calling him \"a great guy.\"\n\nWhen a CNN reporter asked if Trump wanted Whitaker to \"rein in\" Mueller's investigation, Trump said: \"What a stupid question that is. What a stupid question.\"\n\nTrump had long publicly mused about firing Sessions, whose recusal angered him. Trump said Friday he had not spoken to Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey whose name has often been floated as a potential permanent successor to Sessions.\n\nConcerns about succession, bias\n\nFormer U.S. attorney general Alberto Gonzales told CBC News he was \"profoundly concerned\" by the appointment of Whitaker.\n\nGonzales said a decision is made to curtail or end the Mueller probe shouldn't be made by the acting attorney general, but by someone within the normal lines of the chain of authority, either the deputy attorney general or the solicitor general.\n\nHe said the line of succession does not include the attorney general's chief of staff, the role Whitaker was serving under Sessions.\n\nJohn Yoo, like Gonzalez, a Republican veteran of George W. Bush's Justice Department, said \"the Supreme Court made clear that the attorney general is a principal officer,\" in a 1998 case.\n\n\"Therefore, Whitaker cannot serve as acting attorney general.\u2026 Any other officer in the Justice Department who was appointed through advice and consent can serve, including the deputy AG, the solicitor general and the assistant AGs,\" said Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nProtesters gathered in front of the White House in Washington on Thursday as part of a nationwide 'Protect Mueller' campaign demanding that Whitaker recuse himself from overseeing the ongoing special counsel investigation. (Andrew Harnik/Associated Press)\n\nSchumer and other Democrats have also called on Whitaker to recuse himself as he has previously made negative comments about the probe in several media appearances over the past 18 months.\n\nIn one appearance, he defended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer, saying, \"You would always take that meeting.\"\n\nThe meeting has been an area of inquiry by both Senate and House committees investigating Russian interference, and likely Mueller's probe.\n\nIn an op-ed, Whitaker said Mueller would be straying outside his mandate if he investigated Trump family finances and in a talk radio interview he maintained that there was no evidence of collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign.\n\nSo far, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has balked at taking up legislation that would protect Mueller from dismissal and allow him to complete the investigation.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jeff Flake on Thursday said he and his Democratic colleague Chris Coons would push to bring legislation protecting Mueller to the Senate floor.\n\n\"After the firing of the AG, it is more important than ever to protect the Special Counsel,\" Flake, a frequent Trump critic who is leaving the Senate early next year, wrote on Twitter.\n\nSpeaking in Kentucky, McConnell said he expects Trump to nominate a new permanent attorney general \"pretty quickly.\" McConnell said he expects Whitaker to be \"a very interim\" attorney general.", "An Ottawa woman wants to see greater police presence in Barrhaven after numerous homes were broken into, including her own.\n\nStephanie Faucher said she arrived home after picking her son up from school one afternoon last month to find her door frame shattered and door wide open.

The proclamation puts into place regulations adopted Thursday that circumvent laws stating that anyone is eligible for asylum no matter how he or she enters the country.\n\n\"We need people in our country but they have to come in legally, and they have to have merit,\" Trump said Friday as he prepared to depart for Paris for the G20 summit.\n\nThe measures are meant to funnel asylum seekers through official border crossings for speedy rulings, officials said, instead of having them try to circumvent such crossings on the nearly 3,200-kilometre border between the U.S. and Mexico. But the busy ports of entry already have long lines and waits, forcing immigration officials to tell some migrants to turn around and come back to make their claims.\n\nThe move was spurred in part by caravans of Central American migrants slowly moving north on foot but will apply to anyone caught crossing illegally, officials said Thursday. It's unknown whether those in the caravan, many fleeing violence in their homelands, plan to cross illegally.\n\nAdministration officials said those denied asylum under the proclamation may be eligible for similar forms of protection if they fear returning to their countries, though they would be subject to a tougher threshold.

You need MRI imaging, you need other advanced techniques and not every hospital or every health centre has access to these facilities.\"\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada says by collecting data on the broader category of illnesses (AFP), it does monitor all cases of muscle weakness in children. However when CBC News asked PHAC for information on the number of AFM cases in Canada, a spokesperson said she was \"not able\" to provide that breakdown.\n\n\"Canada's existing AFP surveillance system collects information that we can use to trigger further investigations to identify AFM, if required.

(Brent Rathgeber)\n\nBut Rathgeber is sympathetic to those complaints.\n\n\"Although we've inherited party discipline from the British Westminster model, we've taken party discipline to dangerous levels,\" Rathgeber said in an interview Thursday. \"I do believe that parties have too much control over their backbenchers.\"\n\nRathgeber quit the Stephen Harper caucus because he had grown frustrated at being micromanaged and browbeaten by the \"boys in short pants\" in the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nFor Rathgeber, the last straw came when PMO officials gutted the intent of his private member's bill to force senior bureaucrats to disclose their salaries and expenses if asked to do so in a freedom of information request.\n\nThere are obvious parallels to Luff's frustrations.\n\nBut one of the major differences between the two is that Rathgeber voluntarily quit caucus and held a news conference to explain his actions.\n\nLuff, on the other hand, did neither.\n\nIn fact, she was \"disappointed\" to discover her actions had consequences. Members of the NDP caucus voted (unanimously, we're told) to kick her out.\n\nThen there are her suggestions (which sound a bit like demands) to improve the system. They include having cabinet ministers appointed by an independent panel rather than by the premier. Such a system would create chaos.\n\nCabinet is the seat of power in the Westminster parliamentary system.\n\nAfter an election, the lieutenant-governor asks the leader of the winning party to form a government \u2014 in other words, to appoint a cabinet.\n\nDelegating that job to an unelected panel would turn the system upside down and lead to cabinet ministers being responsible not to the premier or caucus or even voters but to a third-party panel.\n\nPerplexed by Luff's actions\n\nRathgeber is careful not to criticize Luff but he, like most people watching this story unfold, is perplexed by Luff's actions. And he says she has undermined her position by boycotting the legislature.\n\n\"If representing your constituents is your primary concern, you should resign from caucus and show up for work and represent your constituents,\" he said.\n\nA major difference between Rathgeber and Luff is that if Rathgeber had kept silent and played the party game, he would have been a well-paid backbench Conservative MP for years, decades even. That's why Rathgeber's actions speak to principle.\n\nLuff, though, did not have a political future, if public opinion polls are correct.\n\nThe NDP is not doing well in Calgary.\n\n'Paper candidate'\n\nLuff is yet another Calgary politician elected under the NDP banner in 2015 who is not running again.\n\nLike most of them, Luff says she wants to spend more time with her family.\n\nLike most of them, she was a paper candidate who did not expect to win but who suddenly found herself thrust into government.\n\nSince then she has been caught in a dilemma as voters in Calgary soured on the NDP. How could she, as an NDP MLA, represent her constituents as they grew increasingly angry at NDP policies such as the carbon tax?\n\nLuff's response was to lash out at her own government.\n\nThat in itself is not bad. Rathgeber did the same thing.\n\nBut Rathgeber never stopped working, never stopped showing up in the House of Commons.\n\nAfter having botched her departure from the NDP caucus, Luff should at least glean one lesson from Rathgeber's story \u2014 and go back to work.", "If Calgary decides to host the Olympics there's one certainty: barring any cost overruns or changes the city will pitch in $390 million toward hosting the Winter Games in 2026.\n\n\n\nBut hosting the games is a bit of a political football. While some on the \"Yes\" side will tell you there are many social and economic benefits, the \"No\" side has outlined a dreary scenario for the city's next generation of taxpayers.\n\nOn November 7th, CBC hosted a town hall to help citizens decide.\n\nThe panel, hosted by the Calgary Eyeopener's David Gray, heard from people on both sides of the bid and took questions from the audience as well as viewers online.\n\nEconomist Trevor Tombe was part of that panel and he outlined what the city's Olympic-sized contribution will look like on an average tax bill for the next few decades.\n\nA recording of the town hall can be viewed below or on CBC Calgary's Facebook page.\n\nTallying up the numbers so far, here's how much public cash the games will gobble up:\n\nGovernment of Canada, $1.45 billion.\n\nProvince of Alberta, $700 million.\n\nCity of Calgary, $390 million, plus $150 million credit for previous financial commitment to improve a downtown district that would be a Games hub.\n\nTown of Canmore, $3 million.\n\nTombe said if the city takes on that Olympic contribution as debt over 20 to 25 years, taxes will have to cover the cost.\n\n\"We are looking at somewhere around one to one-and-a-half per cent increase in property taxes which ... for the median residential payer, that's about $25 per year,\" he said. \"Although significantly more for non-residential payers.\"\n\nIf you're curious, Tombe suggested simply looking at your last property tax bill and add one to one-and-a-half per cent to the total. That's a \"good ballpark.\"\n\nUniversity of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)\n\nHe said the tax estimate could fluctuate depending on future council decisions\n\nMayor Naheed Nenshi, who was also part of the panel, offered a big \"but\" for citizens to consider.\n\n\"That's if it all goes on the property tax, \" he told the crowd. \"What is really critical for us to understand is that we have got different funding sources.\"\n\nNenshi said the city already has a number of funds in place, like an infrastructure fund pool and some of cash needed for the Olympics could come from a variety of city sources. Nenshi also said the city is asking the province to put a hotel tax in place, similar to the one implemented in Canmore.", "Ernest Montsion remembers how afraid a young German soldier looked when Montsion came toward him with his rifle, even though it was more than seven decades ago.\n\n\"He was down on his knees, hands up in the air, looking up at me, and I got a bayonet stuck against his tummy.

(Kirthana Sasitharan/CBC)\n\nEvidence found in the trial so far suggests that lung cancer deaths can be reduced by 20 per cent through early detection.\n\nHey says this is especially important because patients who come in with lung cancer often don't have a long survival rate.\n\n\"Most lung cancer cases are diagnosed at a late stage, where it's already spread to other organs,\" Hey says.\n\n\"That's why we have very poor survival rates from lung cancer at present.\"\n\nShe adds the rationale behind screening is to find lung cancer earlier, then the patient can be treated.\n\n\"No guesswork any longer\"\n\nMarcel Gravel participated in the pilot.\n\nHe says he was glad he did because of what the test was able to find. After being referred to the pilot by his healthcare provider, the screening revealed nodules on his lungs.\n\n\"That was really an awakening for me.\"\n\n\"We moved on to taking biopsies and checking it out to find out that fortunately, [the nodules were] benign. I was one of the fortunate ones,\" Gravel says.\n\nHe comes from a large family of smokers, most of whom he says have quit now. Gravel says he's lost a brother-in-law to lung cancer.\n\nWhile smoking, Gravel says there was always an afterthought regarding what could happen to him.\n\n\"If you've smoked for a long time, and you smoke as much as many of us did, there's always something at the back of your mind saying, there's always a possibility that something may come back to haunt you as you get older,\" Gravel says.\n\nMarcel Gravel participated in the lung cancer screening pilot program at Health Sciences North. The screening found benign nodules on his lungs through early detection. (Kirthana Sasitharan/CBC)\n\nWhen the opportunity came up to be a part of the pilot, Gravel says it was participating that help him realize if there were issues. He also adds he didn`t know what the process was like to detect lung cancer before he became involved in the project.\n\n\"I've come to find out a CT scan was far, far, superior. Much quicker, much more efficient, and the results are far more stable.

None of it has been repaid.\n\nCBC News is not revealing the identity of the 78-year-old man, who police describe in court documents as independently wealthy, generous and susceptible to manipulation.\n\nIn June, police got a court order to search Grenier's bank records and credit card statements. In a sworn affidavit to a judge, officers said the investigation began last summer after the senior reported that $100,000 he had invested was gone. Police looked into the complaint and found the money wasn't missing but had been moved to another investment by Grenier, the man's \"financial adviser,\" the affidavit said.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of the police probe.\n\n\"Recently, events have come to light which suggest that Grenier may have been exploiting [the man's] vulnerabilities, generosity and wealth for his own benefit,\" said Det.-Sgt.

One day while I was researching, I came across a letter written by a mother to her son who was serving in Beaumont-Hamel, and it just drew me in, so I had to keep digging.\n\nQ: Talk to me about how so much loss of people in the World War affected the province.\n\nThere was a lot of mourning after the First World War. I think the best way for me to understand how it impacted the society is to look at the individuals. One person I thought would be nice to talk about today is this soldier, John Fitzgerald.\n\nHe was in the ambulance unit of the Newfoundland Regiment, and he died on the battlefield at Gallipoli binding another man's wounds, so you can imagine the sorrow that his family encountered.\n\nJohn Fitzgerald died on the battlefield in Gallipoli. (Submitted)\n\nNow, while they're dealing with mourning the loss of their son, they also have to apply to the government for separation allowance. This is the money that the government gave to the dependents of soldiers who died at war, so John's mother was his dependent.\n\nShe's a widow, so she applied to the government for the separation allowance. The government turned her down because she had another son of military age. He was living in Pittsburgh, but they wrote her a letter saying we cannot give you the separation allowance because the rule is, if you have a son of military age who did not enlist, you're not eligible for separation allowance.\n\nQ: This is only one story, Jenny, isn't it? There were many like that, devastating not only personally for a mother, but also for the communities.\n\nThe death of a single man could have widespread impacts on a single community, especially these small communities in Newfoundland, and especially if the soldier who was killed was, say, an officer, someone who was from the social or economic elite.\n\nAn example of that would have happened to a community called Three Arms in Green Bay. Its central industry was a cannery. The heir to that industry was a young man named Stephen Norris, who served overseas, and he was also killed in the First World War.\n\nStephen Norris was the heir to a cannery, but died in the First World War. (Submitted)\n\nThat left the cannery, the major employer in Three Arms, without an heir. So when Stephen's father died in 1924, the cannery closed. And it was a devastating blow to the community.\n\nBy the 1940s, I think only two families lived there. In the 1950s, no one was there.\n\nThe cannery in Three Arms closed after its owner and heir died, and the town was vacated by the 1950s. (Submitted)\n\nQ: So there was a human toll taken on families here, there was an economic [toll], and social change was brought about.\n\nWomen worked in the war effort as nurses, caring for wounded soldiers. (Submitted)\n\nThis is one of my favourite stories from the war, it's a positive story. I always love it. I deal with so much sadness studying the war, so it's nice when you can talk about positive social change that happened as a result of the war.\n\nI'm talking about women's suffrage, which is a story I love.\n\nThe Women's Patriotic Association fundraised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help with the war effort. (Submitted)\n\nThe First World War, it had two effects on suffrage. One, it delayed the suffrage movement, which was gaining ground in the early 1900s, but then when the war broke out, all of the suffragists refocused their energy into the war movement.\n\nA lot of the women, they would serve overseas as nurses, and thousands of women in Newfoundland, from all across the island, came together to form the Women's Patriotic Association, so they're knitting the iconic Newfoundland sock that found its way onto the feet of many soldiers serving overseas.\n\nWomen knit thousands and thousands of socks that were sent to soldiers fighting in Europe during the First World War. (Submitted)\n\nThey raised thousands and thousands of dollars, which were used to open a hospital on Waterford Bridge Road, to put beds in hospital wards overseas, to send medical supplies overseas, and eventually there's a dollar figure put on it \u2014 about half a million dollars. Which, at the time, was an enormous sum.\n\nThe government praises women's work doing the war, the press praises it, and the suffragists turn it into a very clever argument.\n\nJenny Higgins says suffragists were praised by government and newspaper editorials for their efforts during the First World War. (Submitted)\n\nThey say, we have demonstrated that women's traditional work makes a tremendous contribution to society, shouldn't we have a say in the governance of that society we're contributing to?\n\nThere were editorials printed, calling for women should have the right to vote, there was a change in public opinion, and the suffragists built on that and in 1925 they got their right to vote.\n\nJenny Higgins goes through some stories from the First World War with Here & Now host Debbie Cooper.

But right now, you can't get the whole story,\" said Brett Schuyler, co-owner of Schuyler Farms, one of Ontario's largest apple orchards. \"You look at the product: How do you know where it's from?\"\n\nBrett Schuyler, co-owner of Schuyler Farms in southern Ontario, would like Canadian consumers to know where the apples that go into their juice come from. But he says it's often hard to tell under our country's current labelling system. (Norm Arnold/CBC)\n\nIn a given year, Schuyler will produce 4,500 tonnes of apples in a dozen varieties. But he estimates that less than five per cent of his harvest ends up in cartons of apple juice sold on store shelves in Canada.\n\nMarketplace reviewed the labels of about two dozen apple juices produced by large-scale Canadian juice-makers and stocked by major grocery stores \u2014 and found a handful that advertise they are made with Canadian apples, including Graves McIntosh Apple, Oasis Classic (not from concentrate) and Tropicana Pure Premium (1.75 litre).\n\n(A few others indicate they consist of \"domestic and imported ingredients\" but provide no other details.)\n\nMarketplace reviewed the labels of about two dozen apple juices produced by major Canadian juice-makers, and found just a handful that advertise they are made with Canadian apples, including Oasis Classic (not from concentrate), Tropicana Pure Premium (1.75 litre) and Graves McIntosh Apple. But other products made by these same companies contain ingredients from outside the country. (CBC and Tropicana.ca)\n\nU.S. labels tell a much clearer story\n\nIt's a different story south of the border, where since 1987, U.S. Customs has insisted that manufacturers indicate country of origin on their juice labels.\n\nSo while a Minute Maid juice box packaged and sold in Canada does not include any country information about its ingredients, its American counterpart clearly states \"contains apple juice concentrate from the U.S.A., Argentina, Chile, China, and Turkey.\"\n\nA Minute Maid juicebox produced in the U.S., shown at left, lists the country-of-origin details. But the Canadian equivalent, shown at right, does not. (CBC)\n\nIt's that kind of transparency Schuyler says is missing from Canadian shelves.\n\n\"It is a great example, looking at what they've done in the States to just put it on the label. Clear country of origin labelling would be a very good thing to see in Canada,\" he said.\n\nFood lawyer Glenford Jameson, who works with companies to ensure their labels meet Canadian standards, says country of origin requirements on juice is a \"voluntary statement\" in Canada.\n\n\"All you need to say is that it's prepared in Canada,\" he said. \"And you can choose to say it's prepared from imported or domestic ingredients \u2014 but you don't necessarily have to spell out where it's from.\"\n\nApples from around the world\n\nWhile apple juice labels aren't legally required to list the country of origin, similar to a number of fruit and vegetable products prepared in Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) does require the labels to include company information.\n\nIn an attempt to learn the source of apples for some of the most popular juice brands sold in Canada, Marketplace contacted the customer service departments of five different companies.\n\nThe agents we reached told Marketplace that their juices were produced with apple concentrate from China, Poland, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand and the U.S. as well as with \"some\" apples from Canada.\n\nWith its massive orchards and cheap labour force, China has become the world's largest producer of apple juice concentrate over the last few decades.\n\nChina is also the number one supplier of apple juice concentrate to Canada, far outpacing other countries, according to Statistics Canada and the World Apple Review. Last year, nearly 30 million litres of apple juice concentrate alone was imported into Canada from China.\n\nApple concentrate is produced from apple juice that is boiled down into a thick liquid, packaged in plastic-lined steel drums and transported around the world by tankers. Once in Canada, the concentrate is mixed with water and reconstituted into a drinkable juice.\n\nThe CFIA is currently reviewing its labelling practices in Canada, though the agency says there are no plans to change the rules around apple juice labels in the future. (Norm Arnold/CBC)\n\nWhile the U.S. does not believe that adding water to a concentrate changes the product substantially, the Canadian government does. In Canada, adding water to apple concentrate is considered \"a substantial transformation,\" the CFIA says, and therefore no country of origin is required because it becomes a \"processed product.\"\n\nMarketplace also reached out to Canada's largest apple juice-maker, A. Lassonde Inc., to ask about the source of its apples or concentrate.\n\nThe Quebec-based Lassonde owns and produces about a dozen juice brands throughout North America, including Oasis, Fairlee, Rougemont and Graves \u2014 and the iconic Allen's, with that navy blue can sporting shiny McIntosh apples, a maple leaf and the slogan: \"A Canadian Favourite For Over 80 Years.\"\n\nWhile a customer service agent first said she thought the apples used in Allen's juice were \"Canadian,\" a later email from the company indicated that the apple concentrate used \"can come from a variety of places, including North America, South America, Asia and Europe.\"\n\nJuice apples not worth the squeeze\n\nBut those answers don't sit well with Schuyler. \"For farmers, it's just frustrating that you can't identify what [or] if this juice was made with Canadian apples.\"\n\nFor farmers like him, growing and selling apples for juice is no longer worth the squeeze. Like many Canadian apple farmers Schuyler focuses on cultivating large, perfect eating apples which fetch a higher price than juice or \"salvage\" apples.\n\n\"It's just pure economics,\" he said.\n\nMarketplace host Charlsie Agro and Brett Schuyler test some of the apples grown at Schuyler Farms, which produces 4,500 tonnes of apples each year in a dozen varieties. (Jeannie Stiglic/CBC)\n\nSchuyler says he is paid about 25 cents a pound for fresh McIntosh apples for eating, for example, compared to just five cents a pound for undercoloured, small, bruised or misshapen fruit that don't meet the standard of perfection for produce aisles.\n\nThat means he makes no money selling juice apples \u2014 because it costs him about that much per pound to harvest them.\n\nAnd there is little incentive for Canadian juice-makers to pay local apple farmers higher prices because of the plentiful supply of cheap, foreign concentrate.\n\n\"This is the problem,\" said Schuyler. \"There's not a lot of interest at the company level about growing Canadian juice.\"\n\nCanada's rule-maker responds\n\nThe CFIA is currently reviewing its labelling practices in Canada, though the agency said there are no plans to change the rules around apple juice labels in the future.\n\nAnd while the CFIA won't force companies to add country of origin information, the agency \"encourages\" companies to add those details for consumers, said Aline Dimitri, executive director and deputy chief food safety officer.\n\n\"What's in everybody's best interest is \u2026 for the information to be available,\" she said. \"As long as this information is available, the consumer has the ability to get it \u2014 and that is what's important for us.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is not just about reading the label; it's about reading the label and asking questions.

(Tim Rooke/WPA Pool/Getty Images/CBC)\n\nOn a list of high-profile environmentalists, Prince Charles's name probably doesn't come instantly to mind.\n\nYou might think, how could the heir to the British throne possibly relate to climate change, polluted oceans and other such problems mounting beyond the gilded walls of his fancy houses? (Plus, isn't he a bit dotty at times, talking to his plants?)\n\nBut Charles, who turns 70 next week, has spent decades thinking about many of those problems, and has in ways been an environmentalist ahead of his time.\n\nCharles's interests have been diverse, from warning about climate change to promoting organic farming and the wool industry. He has launched initiatives like the Prince's Rainforest Project and won global recognition for his environmental efforts.\n\nIn a recent profile in Vanity Fair magazine, Charles lays bare some of his earliest thoughts on the subject. \"As a teenager, I remember feeling deeply about this appallingly excessive demolition job being done on every aspect of life,\" Charles wrote in a letter to the profile author.\n\nHe also recalls a talk he gave decades ago about plastics and other waste. \"At that stage nobody was really interested and I was considered old-fashioned, out of touch and 'anti-science' for warning of such things.\"\n\nHis speeches on these subjects pull few punches, and during a visit to Ghana this week, the fate of the world seemed to weigh on his mind.\n\n\"I am about to have another grandchild, actually,\" he said to business leaders and government officials, a reference to the baby Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are expecting in the spring. \"It does seem to me insanity if we are going to bequeath this completely polluted, damaged and destroyed world to [our grandchildren].\"\n\nThere are those who question Charles's environmental commitment\u2014 after all, doesn't the Royal Family like to hunt? And what about the carbon footprint he and his relations leave behind as they travel the world?\n\nOn his website, Charles seems to anticipate some of that criticism, noting how travel for him and his wife, Camilla, is organized \"so as to reduce carbon emissions\" (although he doesn't explain how).\n\nHis website also touts the fact that his Aston Martin runs on bioethanol made from wine waste and a cheese byproduct. And if for whatever reason he can't get around town in the Aston Martin or any other way, he might take a slightly more prosaic form of transport: a low-emission taxi.\n\n\u2014 Janet Davison\n\nIs cleaner jet fuel more than just blue sky thinking?\n\nAs it stands, flying is a carbon-intensive activity. (Silas Stein/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThinking about how to lower our contribution to climate change while dreaming of vacation plans can be morally complicated. Especially when one transatlantic flight burns as much carbon as the average Canadian emits in a month.\n\nOverall, air travel is responsible for more than two per cent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Electric cars and solar roofs are growing in stature \u2014 but how far along is a renewable solution to powering planes?\n\nOne answer lies in bio-jet fuel, or using sources like plant-based oils to reduce and offset the harm caused by petroleum-based fuel.\n\nA bio-jet fuel has a tall order to fill: it has to withstand cold temperatures, deliver the same efficiency and work with existing plane fuel systems. Oh, and it has to avoid consuming more natural resources by taking up land that could be used for food production or carbon capture.\n\nStill, some are trying. Neste, a Finnish oil company, has developed a biofuel using non-edible vegetable and animal residues that it says can reduce plane emissions by 40 to 90 per cent. There's also some promise in using algaeas a biofuel, given its high oil yield and the fact that it grows faster than most crops.\n\nPromise, but also problems \u2014 namely, cost-effectiveness, finding a way to scale up production and delivering biofuel to airports, to name a few.\n\nPlus, bio-jet fuels still burn carbon. While it's a lesser amount, and the emissions might include fewer harmful particles like sulphur, keep in mind that the basic premise is that a plant-based fuel offsets what it burns by sucking carbon out of the air during its life as a crop.\n\nThe good news is this is no longer an armchair discussion. Hundreds of flights have been tested using bio-jet fuel blends, including long-hauls from Australia to the United States.\n\nAir Canada has completed eight test flights using renewable biofuels, and the Canadian government is holding an 18-month competition for a homegrown biofuel, offering millions of dollars for the most economically viable solutions.\n\nSo there's high interest, even if we're nowhere near a future where your vacation is guilt-free.\n\n\u2014 Anand Ram\n\nThe Big Picture: The high price of trash\n\nWe were intrigued by this question Calgary reader Arthur Darby sent us:\n\n\"Curious: somewhere in Scandinavia there is an incinerator that burns plastic waste for fuel. Apparently if it's hot enough there are no emissions. Does Canada have any incinerators like this?\"\n\nThe answer is yes. Canada's newest waste-to-energy plant is the Durham York Energy Centre in Ontario, which opened in 2016. It can process 140,000 tonnes of garbage a year, generating 14 megawatts, or enough electricity to power about 10,000 homes.\n\nBut according to the latest stats, incinerators handleless than five per cent of municipal solid waste in Canada. The graph below gives a sense of why: It's expensive.\n\nThesefigures, provided by the World Bank, show the range of costs per tonne for different types of waste disposal in high-income countries like Canada. (Note: Collection and transfer happens regardless of the final disposal method, which is why it's separate.)\n\nTwo things to consider:\n\nThe cost of composting may actually be lower, as the figures don't include the sale of compost.\n\nmay actually be lower, as the figures don't include the sale of compost. The range of waste-to-energy may be higher, as it doesn't include the cost of removing the ash left behind.\n\nWant to know more?

(STR/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThis week, CBC business columnist Don Pittis looked at China's growing stature as a manufacturer of electric cars.\n\nWe keep hearing that China is becoming the Detroit of the electric car industry.\n\nBacked by government subsidies, loans and regulations, the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) industry is growing at a pace unseen in the rest of the world. So if these Chinese cars are so great \u2014 or at least so ubiquitous \u2014 you may be asking yourself, why aren't they on Canadian roads?\n\nPart of it is that they have to compete against the established players in the electric-car market, like Tesla and Nissan, which have networks of dealerships. But within the first three months of next year, you will be able to ride in a Chinese electric car.\n\nThe manufacturer BYD is bringing a fleet of its specialized taxi vehicles to Montreal. Billed as the best-selling electric vehicle built as a taxi, the BYD E6 is not cheap \u2014 it's estimated to be about $60,000 Cdn. But it will pay off quickly for its operators because of low fuel and maintenance costs.\n\nAccording to Ted Dowling, BYD's vice-president for Canada, commercial use vehicles such as taxis, trucks and buses have a much quicker payback time than consumer vehicles just because they are on the road so much.\n\nBYD is best known in investing circles because of its largest private investor, billionaire Warren Buffett. The company has not said when it will begin importing its vehicles for consumer sales, but Dowling said he has driven them himself and thinks they're as good as any other car made today.\n\nThis could very well be the beginning of a flood of Chinese EVs. Right now, there are at least 14 major carmakers in China, most of which are in the electric car business.\n\nBut the first Chinese-made electric car Canadians drive may not seem very Chinese at all. The famous Swedish luxury brand Volvo is actually owned by Chinese carmaker Geely, and some Volvo cars sold in Canada are already being made in China. What's more, Volvo has promised that by 2019, every model of its fleet of cars will be available in hybrid or plug-in electric form.\n\nStay in touch!\n\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?

In 1915, the regiment's 13th battalion had 27 officers, 18 of whom were millionaires. One \u2014 Capt.

He's watched proudly as Hinkson has risen through the ranks and appreciates the enthusiasm and good nature he brings to his duties.\n\n\"Now he's one of the senior captains.

But a careful eye might notice his uniform is pressed just a bit more sharply than that of other drivers.\n\n\"I like the presentation of a clean-cut bus driver.

Having fought from Vimy Ridge to Amiens, he returned home to Ontario with painful memories of the Great War.\n\nAs traumatic as those experiences were, efforts to help him overcome the strain of what he had endured also gave him an unlikely skill: the ability to do intricate needlework.\n\nLike many other British Empire soldiers injured in the First World War, Muth was hospitalized in England. While recovering, he was introduced to stitching by women from Britain's Royal School of Needlework and helped make an embroidery that found a home on the altar at London's famed St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\n\"Both hands were terribly wounded and it was good therapy,\" his son, Malcolm Muth, said at his home in Port Dover, Ont.\n\nLance-Cpl.

Wounded in battle, they were taught in hospitals across the U.K. to stitch as a way to improve dexterity and overcome post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"The convalescing servicemen at the military hospitals - all dressed uniformly in their 'hospital blues' of a blue jacket, blue trousers, a white shirt and a red necktie - would find solace, inspiration and a measure of pride,\" Barnard wrote.\n\n\"The act of sewing would add focus and purpose to their recovery, while improving their hand co-ordination and allaying boredom and melancholy.\"\n\nJames Muth is known to have embroidered a yellow tulip for the altar cloth, but it's unclear exactly which one.

The asteroid will pass within roughly 381,000 kilometres of Earth. That is 3,000 kilometres closer than the moon's average distance from our planet.\n\nGianluca Masi captured 2018 VX1, seen in crosshairs, with a 17-inch telescope in Ceccano, Italy, on Nov. 7. (Gianluca Masi/The Virtual Telescope Project)\n\nNow, if that sounds close, consider this: all the planets in our solar system, including Pluto, can fit between Earth and the moon. So there is a lot of room out there.\n\nSo far, based on the relatively limited observations of 2018 VX1, astronomers have calculated that this is the closest the 11-metre-wide rock will come to Earth until 2110 (it has an orbital period around the sun of 1.6 years).\n\nAt 1:20 p.m. ET on Saturday, 2018 VX1 will safely zip past Earth at approximately 20,000 km/h.\n\nAnd while it may seem troubling that an asteroid is passing so close to Earth after being discovered just days earlier, it happens more often than you might think. That's because asteroids are relatively small and, therefore, difficult to spot.\n\nBut that's precisely the good news: they are small.\n\nAn orbital diagram illustrating the path of newly discovered asteroid 2018 VX1.

The resulting air burst when it entered the Earth's atmosphere shattered windows, injuring roughly 1,000 people.

William MacKay, of Charlottetown, was the youngest Canadian killed in the Korean War. (Korean War Veteran Journal)\n\nThrough his research, Burtch found that 309 Canadian soldiers were killed in direct combat with North Korean and Chinese forces, or died of wounds, or went missing and were presumed dead. Three sailors were killed under fire aboard a Canadian destroyer.\n\nWhat about the other 204?\n\n\"A great many of those were accidental deaths, accidental discharges of weapons,\" he said. \"There were, unfortunately, many cases of natural causes.\"\n\nUp to eight of the deaths were suicides.\n\nBurtch said he was surprised by the fact that 75 of the Canadian soldiers assigned to Korea actually died at home due to poor health or accidents \u2014 such as the November 1950 train wreck in Canoe River, B.C. which took the lives of soldiers headed to Korea.\n\n\"Being able to discern how many people died under different circumstances after they had come home, or just before they left, was certainly revealing,\" he said.\n\n\"You look at the cost of the war not isolated to the theatre overseas, but also here at home.\"\n\nThe project is immensely important to Korean war veterans like retired warrant officer David Davidson, 85, who maintained and repaired artillery pieces during the war.\n\n\"It will add something to those who paid the supreme sacrifice,\" said Davidson. \"They'll know where everyone fell.

Over a dozen years of fighting in Afghanistan, just over 40,000 Canadian troops served on various rotations.\n\nAnd Korea differed from other, subsequent conflicts involving Canadian troops in one other significant way.

He'll be the oldest premier of New Brunswick, ever\n\nHiggs will be the first New Brunswick premier from the Saint John area in 83 years.\n\nSix of the last seven premiers who won power through elections were in their 30s. The exception, David Alward, was 50.\n\nHiggs is 64.\n\nBut that's more than just a break from the recent pattern. Higgs will be the oldest premier to take office ever \u2014 since the advent of responsible government in 1854. (Leonard Tilley, sworn in at age 63 in 1933, is the current record-holder.)\n\nHiggs made a virtue of his age when the Liberals attacked him for having run for the leadership of the Confederation of Regions Party in 1989. Higgs was 35 at the time, the same age as Premier Brian Gallant when the negative ads were launched last year.\n\n\"I've been attacked about decisions I might have made when I was premier's age,\" Higgs said, \"and that's why I can understand some of the decisions the premier's been making now.\"\n\n2. He's from the smallest 'city' in the province\n\nHiggs, a former finance minister, speaks to the leadership convention in Fredericton in 2016. (Julianne Hazlewood/CBC)\n\nHiggs grew up in Forest City. The name is a bit of a misnomer: the remote community on a lake on the New Brunswick-Maine border is the farthest thing you can imagine from an actual city.\n\nLast year Higgs estimated the year-round population of Forest City at seven people. \"It survives because of the summer activity, not because of any industry or economic development,\" he said.\n\nThat gives him a perspective on small-town life, he said. \"There are a lot of rural communities that are challenged, and kids are leaving. Let's not pretend otherwise. Let's lay it all out there and say, 'What collectively are we going to do?'\"\n\n3. He worked for the Irvings\n\nHiggs spent 33 years of his career working for Irving Oil ltd. (CBC)\n\nCritics of the Irvings joke that every premier \"works\" for the billionaire family, but Higgs actually did. He spent 33 years with Irving Oil.\n\nWhen the Liberals used that to attack him as a pawn of big business, Higgs responded that working for Irving Oil allowed him to do what many New Brunswickers dream of.\n\n\"I would like that opportunity for anyone coming out of university, or coming out of high school \u2026 to have an opportunity to find a job and have a career right here,\" he said.\n\nHe has also said the Irving ethos \u2014 cost efficiency and measurable targets \u2014 would help him as premier. \"I learned a lot working for that company,\" he said.\n\n\"It's ironic to me that someone would say because I have had broad experience throughout my career, that's not a plus to being in the middle of an $8 billion expenditure of taxpayer money.\"\n\n4. He ran for the leadership of another party\n\nHiggs also ran for the leadership of the COR party. This photo was taken in 1989. (CBC Archives )\n\nThere's a long history of party-switching and floor-crossing among New Brunswick politicians, but Higgs may be the first person to run for the leadership of one party and then become premier as the leader of another.\n\nAlthough he moved from a protest party to a mainstream one, he seems to like that the Greens and the People's Alliance are shaking up the traditional way of doing politics, a system he says he disdains.\n\nFor example, he ruled out a PC-Liberal coalition, he said, because voters \"have elected two other parties that cannot and should not be shut out of this process.\"\n\n5. \u2026 and not just any other party\n\nThe party Higgs wanted to lead in 1989, the Confederation of Regions, was anti-bilingualism, while the PC party he now leads lists official bilingualism as one of its key principles.\n\nHiggs says he no longer subscribes to the COR worldview. \"I believe that all New Brunswickers, French and English, have the opportunity to speak their own language and to learn another one,\" he said in August. \"My opinion has changed over the last 30 years.\"\n\nEven so, many Acadian organizations are wary about what his COR past means for his approach to language rights.\n\n6. He's the first unilingual premier elected since 1970\n\nHiggs's ability to overcome suspicions about his COR past will be hampered by his inability to speak French well.\n\nThe PC leader started taking lessons after he won the PC leadership and has gamely made small talk with francophones. He has also delivered two major speeches entirely in French.\n\nBlaine Higgs will be sworn in as the province\u2019s new Progressive Conservative premier on Friday. Here are eight things you need to know about him. 1:40\n\nBut he remains unable to do substantial interviews in the language, making it harder for him to address francophone concerns in his own words. He said this week that he didn't have time for his lessons during the busy campaign but will restart them soon.\n\n7. He won the party leadership despite his fellow MLAs, not because of them\n\nHiggs signals to the gallery prior to the closure of the throne speech debate. (James West/Canadian Press)\n\nIn the 2016 leadership race, most PC MLAs, including former ministers who had worked closely with him in the Alward cabinet, chose to support candidates other than Higgs. Only two current MLAs backed him.\n\nPortland-Simonds MLA Trevor Holder, who supported Mel Norton, said at the time that Higgs's vocal dislike of politics was misplaced, because elected officials should respond to their constituents and communities. \"When it's done right \u2026 politics is what makes things happen.\"\n\nAnd Rothesay MLA Ted Flemming, who supported Monica Barley, took an apparent swipe at Higgs's focus on the deficit.\n\n\"New Brunswick isn't just a balance sheet,\" he said. \"I'm from the Progressive Conservative Party. That word means something to me. That word has history.\"\n\n8. He's in a hurry, but he may not be able to hurry\n\nHiggs says the campaign kept him busy, but he plans to start up his French lessons again soon. (Radio-Canada)\n\nHiggs promised quick action to tackle the province's problems if he became premier.\n\nHe's asking that proposals to address a shortage of paramedics be on his desk next week, he plans to join a legal challenge of the federal climate plan by the end of this month, and PC MLA Bruce Northrup says a moratorium on fracking could be lifted in the Sussex area before the end of the year.\n\nBut Higgs has acknowledged he'll be forced to scale back some of his ambitions in the first legislature since 1920 in which no party won a majority.\n\nThe People's Alliance has promised to support him on confidence votes for 18 months, but will decide how to vote on other legislation one bill at a time.\n\nThat may make it difficult for Higgs to do all the things he feels are necessary \u2014 making him the first premier to take office in that position in a century.", "Like a growing number of Toronto commuters, Doug Beatty pedals to work these days with a little bit of electric assistance.\n\nRain or shine, hot or cold, the 16 kilometre trip to his part-time retirement job usually takes about 45 minutes.

So the ringing of those bells was of paramount importance to me,\" Broome said.", "For those who've been paying attention, Facebook's growth appears to be slowing. It's not clear why, but one theory is that we're reaching a saturation point, particularly in North America. Basically, everyone has already signed up for an account. Facebook is literally running out of new people to bring aboard.\n\nThis is a problem (for Facebook, to be clear) for a number of reasons. Most notably, North American users are Facebook's most valuable. Facebook makes more dollars from each user in Canada and the U.S. than it does anywhere else in the world. If you accept the theory that Facebook is running out of new users \u2014 a once-reliable source of new revenue \u2014 then it has to find a way to squeeze more out of those it already has.\n\nOne answer could be dating. And classifieds, and fundraising, and gaming, and weather, and job-hunting, and live-streaming, and food delivery, and deal-hunting and on and on and on until there is no market or industry left unstamped by the company's omnipresent blue F.\n\nBut let's focus, for a moment, on dating. Starting this week, Facebook users in Canada can sign up for the company's new dating service. When it was announced back in May, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said about 200 million people had listed their relationship status as single. Facebook thought it could help.\n\nThe point is not necessarily to usurp Tinder or Bumble or any of the other popular dating apps and services that people already like. (Though Facebook would no doubt like that.) Rather, it's Facebook's way of ratcheting up the gravitational pull of its ever-expanding digital universe \u2014 a play to keep its existing users engaged in lieu of rapid new growth. By giving Facebook users more reasons to visit the service more often, and for longer at a time, Facebook has more opportunities to figure out what users like \u2014 valuable data for advertisers. More time spent means Facebook can display more accurate ads, and display them more often, too.\n\nThat's the play. And even if Facebook's dating feature isn't being monetized yet, it still gets people to spend more time within Facebook's overall app, where there are plenty of other opportunities for ads to appear.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced the company's dating feature at its annual F8 developers conference in San Jose in May. (Stephen Lam/Reuters)\n\nDating is just the latest example of Facebook launching a feature similar enough to something a competitor has built. Clearly the strategy is working well enough for Facebook to do it again and again. Each new product may not be compelling enough to attract new users on their own, but it's easier to justify using if you're already on Facebook all the time. The barrier to entry is lower when you don't have to download one more app, or sign up for something new.\n\nIt's why Facebook has a Craigslist clone called Marketplace, and a GoFundMe clone called Fundraisers. You can use Facebook to find jobs, discounts and offers. You could never check your smartphone's weather app again in favour of Facebook's forecast. Its Events app isn't all that different from Eventbrite, and in some cases you can buy tickets through Facebook too. You can trade Slack for Facebook Workplace, or choose to ignore Twitch and stream yourself playing video games with Gaming Video feature instead.\n\nThe most blatant \u2014 and arguably successful clone \u2014 has been the introduction of Stories, the short-form bursts of vertical video that Snapchat introduced, but Instagram popularized further. It was suddenly possible to use Snapchat less when Instagram had one of its most compelling features too.\n\nIt's also why so many people got their news from Facebook, for a time, until Facebook realized how much of a liability being a news source had become.\n\nThe downside to this \u2014 though Facebook may not see it this way \u2014 is that it's difficult to know, or understand, or explain what, exactly, Facebook even is at this point. \"Social network\" seems too quaint for all the company now does. Perhaps recognizing this, Facebook has more recently opted to broadly frame its utility as a facilitator of relationships in all their forms: romantic, platonic, professional, commercial, recreational and more.\n\nFacebook also bears an increasingly uncanny resemblance to the web portals of yore \u2014 the AOLs, Yahoos and CompuServes that sought to put everything the web could offer in one centralized place (so much so that, in some countries, Facebook essentially is the internet, to disastrous effect). We all know what happened next. But unlike those portals, which existed when \"logging on\" was something you did rather than experience as a perpetual state of being, Facebook is something wholly different \u2014 more pervasive, widespread, the firmament of our world. Dating, alongside all those other features, is how Facebook plans to keep it that way.", "A second politician in eastern Ontario is coming under fire for apparently restricting access to his social media accounts.\n\nRandy Hillier, the Progressive Conservative MPP for Lanark\u2013\u200bFrontenac\u2013\u200bKingston, is being accused by one of his constituents of blocking parts of his Facebook page following a disagreement over his government's decision to repeal Ontario's cap-and-trade system.\n\nThat constituent, Jeff Collver of Perth, Ont., said he was inspired to go public with his complaint after Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson was served with a lawsuit last month by three people he blocked on Twitter.\n\nWatson later unblocked his detractors.\n\n\"I'm a voting citizen. My taxes pay for [Hillier's] office's computers,\" Collver told CBC News Thursday.\n\n\"When they put things out there, the intention is to provide information and to obtain input.

Politics is a blood sport, yes, but it tends to leave one's personal character intact, even if his or her political reputation is damaged.\n\nTony Clement has endured all kinds of blows to his professional reputation during his decades in Canadian politics, and often deservedly so. He was reamed for misrepresenting the position of Statistics Canada during the Harper government's campaign to eliminate the long-form census. He was pounced on for misleading Canadians about millions of dollars worth of G8 spending, which conveniently went to \"infrastructure projects\" in his riding, including one very expensive gazebo. He was chewed up and spit out by three failed party leadership campaigns.\n\nThose blows were all survivable. But the trouble Clement now finds himself in \u2014 of sending \"intimate\" photos of himself to women he met online and facing not one, but two potential extortion attempts as a result \u2014 is different. This time, the scandal is profoundly, devastatingly humiliating.\n\nDemand for \u20ac50,000\n\nThe original story, reported Tuesday, was that Clement had resigned from all committee roles after someone allegedly tried to extort him over sexually explicit images and a video he shared with a recipient he thought was a \"consenting female.\" In fact, the recipient was a foreign actor, Clement says, who reportedly demanded \u20ac50,000 ($75,200 Cdn) to keep the images private.\n\nInitially, it seemed as though the Conservative MP did all the right things: he admitted to sharing the files; he informed the RCMP, his party and the Privy Council Office about the attempted extortion; and he apologized profusely in a public statement. According to Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, Clement also told him this exchange was an isolated incident.\n\nBut this was not an isolated incident, of course. In a letter to constituents published Thursday, Clement disclosed that he was subject to a previous potential extortion attempt last summer, which he says he brought to the Ontario Provincial Police.\n\nWatch: The National's report on the Clement scandal\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has asked longtime MP Tony Clement to leave the Conservative caucus after he shared sexually explicit images and a video with an individual online. 3:37\n\nMore than the nature of his interactions, Clement's grotesque lack of judgment makes the decision to remove him from the Conservative caucus unassailable. Not only did he make himself vulnerable to extortion while serving on Canada's national security and intelligence committee, but he apparently did so repeatedly, somehow managing to keep the first case under the radar. This can only be explained by hubris, or stupidity, or both.\n\n(It is also concerning, assuming that Clement really did report the first case to the necessary authorities, that he was still somehow cleared to sit on the 11-member parliamentary committee tasked with overseeing Canada's security and intelligence agencies.)\n\nThat said, lack of judgment has plagued \u2014 but not buried \u2014 plenty a politician before. Indeed, many have made boneheaded political and personal decisions but still managed to hang on, or even totally recover. But what makes this situation different is the location from where Clement appears to be making his decisions.\n\nGranted, there is nothing inherently wrong with two consenting adults sharing intimate images with each other. One could also make the case that Clement choosing to stray from his marriage is none of the public's business (though it certainly becomes our business when the integrity of our national security apparatus is potentially compromised as a result).\n\nBut Clement's online activities are suggestive less of a simple affair than of a man trolling social media for sexual gratification. Indeed, it's reminiscent of the antics of Anthony Weiner, the former New York congressman who was repeatedly caught sexting multiple women, even after he resigned and then returned to politics.\n\nThe impression is of a guy incapacitated by his own sexual urges and unable to make rational decisions as a result. That makes him tough to look in the eye, a failing that is devastating on a personal level, and deadly in politics.\n\nThat loss of dignity is what might make this episode one from which Clement's career may never recover. Constituents might forget the intricacies of the scandal, but they probably won't view him with the same esteem they once did. And even in this ruthless business of news and politics, that makes the fallout difficult to watch.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Premier John Horgan.\n\nHalfway through a heated electoral reform debate with Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson, Horgan argued that youth voters would be emboldened by having their vote count in a proportional representation system.\n\n\"Young people like the idea of working together,\" Horgan said.\n\nAnd then, without pause: \"If you were woke, you'd know that pro rep is lit.\"\n\nIn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PRDebate?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PRDebate</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jjhorgan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jjhorgan</a> says if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wilkinson4BC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Wilkinson4BC</a> was 'woke' he'd know that proportional representation is 'lit'. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/electoralreform?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#electoralreform</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bcpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bcpoli</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4NDj3OgOg1\">pic.twitter.com/4NDj3OgOg1</a> \u2014@cbcnewsbc\n\nLet's explain\n\nAs per Merriam-Webster, woke is defined as: \"aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).\"\n\nLit, a newer term, is explained in Urban Dictionary as \"having qualities pertaining to dopeness or greatness.\"\n\nAmid the bickering between leaders that drowned out their arguments, Horgan's quip stood out. It was instantly parroted by the Internet and produced one of the most memorable moments of the evening.\n\nGo John Horgan, but did he just say \u201cif you were woke, you\u2019d know that pro rep is lit?\u201d That was...surreal <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bcpoli?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bcpoli</a> \u2014@ish_bhuiyan25 When Horgan said \u201cif you\u2019re woke Pro Rep is lit\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/lwsfgIvcqP\">pic.twitter.com/lwsfgIvcqP</a> \u2014@nickbondi\n\nClueing in that a viral moment had just been born, the B.C. NDP party tweeted the quote within minutes.\n\nSuddenly, Horgan's catchphrase seemed less improvised and more of a ploy to target young voters. But in a post-debate scrum with reporters, Horgan chalked it up to being a dad.\n\n\"I have two millennial kids and I saw a Tracey Ullman [Show] episode about a woke support group. No plan, it just kind of happened,\" he said.\n\nRecycled catchphrase\n\nBut it's not the first time the phrase has been adopted.\n\nVote PR BC, the official group campaigning for proportional representation, has been using \"Pro Rep is Lit\" since mid-October as the centrepiece of a campaign to target youth voters.\n\nA promotional item from Vote PR BC's Facebook page. (Vote PR BC/Facebook)\n\nThe students' union at the University of British Columbia Okanagan also embraced the same slogan as part of an outreach campaign in October. But it pulled down its ads after facing criticism from some student groups that it was biased.\n\nHorgan tossed some other zingers during the debate (\"If I'm just going to listen to one guy yell over top of the other guy, I'm just going to watch Wheel of Fortune.\")\n\nBut, in the minds of some voters, it appears \"pro rep is lit\" made Horgan seem, well, lit.", "Well, so much for polite debate.\n\nThursday's electoral reform referendum debate between Premier John Hogan and Opposition Leader Andrew Wilkinson was the highest-profile opportunity for both leaders to make their pitch \u2014 Horgan to champion proportional representation, Wilkinson to stay with the status quo.\n\nIt was a chance to sway voters on the fence over to their side with strong arguments.\n\nInstead, voters got shouting, non-answers and one-liners.\n\n\"You won't tell people how many votes they have, you won't tell people how many MLAs they have ... people are being confused by this ballot,\" said Wilkinson, shouting over Hogan.\n\n\"If you were woke, you'd know that pro rep is lit,\" said Horgan, in a line that will undoubtedly be the most recited in days to come.\n\nIt made for a lively 30 minutes. Whether it changed anybody's mind is a different matter.\n\nInsistent vs. hectoring?\n\nIn the five months since Attorney General David Eby announced what would be on the ballot, the arguments haven't really evolved, as Thursday's debate made clear.\n\nThose in favour of proportional representation gloss over the unknowns and differences between the three systems on the referendum ballot. Instead, they talk about \"fairness\" and \"collaboration\" inherent in the system. Those who want to keep the current voting system complain about the referendum itself and focus on the unknowns instead of actual merits of the different electoral systems.\n\n'If you were woke, you'd know that pro rep is lit,' said Horgan, in a line that will undoubtedly be the most recited in days to come. (CBC)\n\nAnd so it played out again: Wilkinson would complain about things that would be decided by an all-party committee or electoral boundary commission after the referendum and attempted to force Horgan to give detailed answers on three different systems under limited time constraints.\n\nIn turn, Horgan would broadly praise the merits of proportional representation \u2014 \"we're giving people choice when they go into the ballot box\" was one such line \u2014 but not describe the details of each system. He looked exasperated when Wilkinson continued to harangue him.\n\n\"Come on, man,\" he said several times.\n\nBut neither adequately wrestled with the main points from the other side.\n\n\"I was hopeful there would have been more education and less hectoring, but people will have to decide what they think,\" Horgan lamented afterward in a press conference some observers thought provided more details than the actual debate.\n\nWere any minds changed?\n\nLeave aside the question of whether Horgan regrets having three options on the ballot that Wilkinson could conflate again and again. And leave aside whether Wilkinson's first large-scale exposure to the public left a positive impression.\n\nIf you believe public polling, both sides are in a tie. So if either man managed to sway a substantial amount of voters, it could be a turning point.\n\nBut no new arguments were really advanced. If the debate made anything clear, it's that both sides have fine-tuned what they feel are their best rhetorical attacks.\n\n\"John Horgan controls this entire process ... and what he's asking you to do is write that blank cheque for that car you don't understand,\" said Wilkinson.\n\n'John Horgan controls this entire process ... and what he's asking you to do is write that blank cheque for that car you don't understand,' said Wilkinson. (CBC)\n\n\"I believe we should put the fear to one side, and we should look at hope. I believe we should focus on going forward instead of backward,\" said Horgan.\n\nThey're nice one-liners. But we've had five months of nice one-liners. It's now up to the public to search out the resources they need to be feel informed.\n\nBecause if all they did was rely on the remarks from the two leaders on Thursday, they might be lacking.", "Five Manitoba First Nations have launched a lawsuit and want an injunction to be granted to block a newly-minted junior hockey league they allege has poached some of their players.\n\nThe five communities behind the lawsuit are Peguis First Nation, Norway House Cree Nation, Opaskwayak Cree Nation, Fisher River Cree Nation and Cross Lake First Nation.\n\nTogether they filed a statement of claim with the Queen's Bench on Oct. 31 against the new Capital Region Junior Hockey League, a number of Interlake hockey teams and the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association as well as Hockey Manitoba.\n\nThe First Nations are seeking damages for alleged breaches of contract with players.

Ben Hutton and Erik Gudbranson each had a goal and an assist, and Antoine Roussel and Jake Virtanen added goals for the Canucks, who have scored 26 goals in the last five games.\n\n\"I had some puck luck today probably,\" Eriksson said. \"We know we have some young guys playing, and they are still learning, but they are handling their situations and responding well.\"\n\nJake DeBrusk scored twice, Patrice Bergeron, Matt Grzelcyk and Danton Heinen added goals, and David Krejci finished with three assists for Bruins.

Otherwise we would just have our list of what we want and get it,\" Freeland said at the event, about Canada-U.S. relations in the wake of the midterm elections.\n\n\"I think probably the issue which Canadians are very aware was a difficult one and where the U.S. wanted increased access, was access to the Canadian dairy market,\" she said.\n\n\"I feel comfortable with the deal that we struck, the level of increased access is comparable to was what agreed to by the Conservative government in the [Trans-Pacific Partnership] negotiations. That was a compromise that we offered to the United States as part of a broader deal.\"\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told an audience in Toronto that the single biggest concession Canada had to make during the NAFTA negotiation was giving the U.S. more access to Canada's Dairy market. 1:01\n\nRosemary Barton, co-host of CBC's The National \u2014 who was steering the discussion between Freeland, herself and Washington Post senior political reporter Aaron Blake \u2014 pushed the minister on her decision not to use the word \"concession.\"\n\nFreeland replied: \"It was a compromise.\"\n\nBarton pressed Freeland on the minister's decision not to use the word \"concession.\" (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\nOn the flip side, Freeland said Canada's greatest gains were the continued access to the American market.\n\n\"To have that is a really big deal,\" she said.\n\nThe minister said the new deal also contains a number of \"significant improvements over the old NAFTA.\" Her \"personal favourite\" was the elimination of a provision that allowed U.S. companies to sue the Canadian government for passing laws that hurt their business interests.\n\n\"Another thing that we got rid of, which I am really pleased about, is something that was known as the 'energy ratchet clause' which committed us to selling a certain portion of our energy exports to the United States,\" Freeland said.\n\n\"To me, that impinges on our sovereignty and I am glad that that is gone too,\" she added.\n\nAsked by Barton whether she was concerned about media reports that officials in the U.S. are tinkering with the text of the agreement, now called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), Freeland said it was her job to worry about the Canadian political process and not what is going on in the U.S. or Mexico.\n\n\"It would be presumptuous for us to comment on and assume responsibility for somebody else's politics so we don't,\" she said.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said that in the wake of a reporter being banned from the White House that journalism is an essential institution of a functioning democracy. 1:37\n\nFreeland was also asked if she thought it was fair for Donald Trump's administration to revoke CNN's chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press credentials for the White House after a testy exchange that saw the U.S. president call Acosta a \"rude, terrible person.\"\n\n\"It is important for political leaders, political leaders particularly of democracies to speak out for journalists,\" Freeland said.\n\n\"I think a lot of us have been thinking a lot about what makes democracies, democracies.

She has a new exhibit at the Royal Air Force Museum London that explores the deeply personal stories of the trials and tribulations experienced by these wartime unions.\n\n\"It feels right, so many of the women came from Britain, from London,\" Tosh said. \"I wanted to bring them back here in a public way.\"\n\nThe exhibit, War Brides: One-Way Passage, features the portraits of 40 war brides on their wedding days along with their stories printed on silk beside them.\n\nTosh's work focuses on war brides from the Second World War. From 1939 to 1945, half a million Canadian soldiers were stationed in Britain, many for three or more years. During that time, as many as one in 10 of these servicemen married local women, leading to an influx of European women immigrating to Canada in 1946.\n\nLynn Martin takes in the portrait of her mother Violet (Sharples) Findlay at the War Brides: One Way Passage exhibit at the Royal Air Force Museum London. (Brenna Engel)\n\nThe lucky brides where the ones whose husbands survived the war. They were expected to leave their homes and move to his native country, although many women who crossed the sea to live in Canada were abandoned by their husbands.\n\nTosh herself is the child of parents brought together by war: her father was a Royal New Zealand pilot and her mother was a Canadian war bride. She hopes those who view her exhibit leave with a better understanding of the strength of these women who left their homes for an uncertain future in a new country.\n\nTosh said she has has heard hundreds of war bride stories, each unique. She doesn't know when, if ever, her work will be complete.\n\n\"I keep thinking I'm finished,\" said Tosh. \"I don't know, I've never known. I thought I'd be lucky to get 12 and I'm somewhere between 150 and 200.\"\n\nOne person's story in particular caught her attention: Violet Findlay.\n\nThe story of Violet (Sharples) Findlay\n\nViolet Findlay, born Violet Sharples, was a leading airwoman in the Royal Air Force. Her identical twin, Betty Sharples, was also an airwoman. Though identical, the two could not be more dissimilar in personality. Violet was quiet and reserved, while Betty was outgoing and loud. Betty was often late for curfew at their barracks, so Violet would pretend to be Betty during bed checks since their bunks were at opposite ends of the room.\n\nThe sisters were separated after the war when Violet married George Findlay, a Canadian soldier, and Betty married a British professor.\n\nViolet Findlay, right, was born Violet Sharples in Lancashire, England. She and her identical twin sister, Betty Sharples, were both members of the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. (Submitted by Lynn Martin)\n\nViolet moved to her husband's farm near Davidson, Sask., which was a stark difference from her home in Blackburn, Lancashire. The couple went on to raise six children in Saskatchewan.\n\nTheir daughter, Lynn Martin, is president of Canadian War Brides and Families. She met Tosh at a war bride reunion several years ago and the two struck up a friendship and have been close ever since.\n\n\"I consider her like a sister,\" said Tosh. \"She has an empathy that's deep within her. And I assume her mother must've been like that.\"\n\nSoon after that meeting, Tosh knew she had to paint Violet and tell her story.\n\nAfter the war, Violet and George Findlay moved to his farm near Davidson, Sask., and raised six children. (Submitted by Lynn Martin)\n\nMartin, who lives in Calgary, said that growing up, she knew her mother was different from other mothers, though she didn't learn what a war bride was, and that her mother was one, until the age of 17.\n\nShe said her mother, like many war brides, did not always find a warm reception in Canada.\n\n\"It was hard to get to know the ladies in Canada because they were \u2026 some of them were a little upset that their men had married foreigners and they weren't marrying their sweethearts from high school,\" she said.\n\nNevertheless, Martin said her mother was one of the lucky ones because she had her husband.\n\n'She'd be very proud'\n\n\u200bSeven decades after her mother crossed the Pacific Ocean as a Canadian war bride, Martin made the trip in reverse to see her mother's portrait exhibited in London.\n\nViolet died in a car accident in 1981 at the age of 60. Seeing her mother's portrait helped bring Martin close to her mother once again.\n\n\"I think she'd be very, very proud, you know, that somebody took the time to paint the picture to tell her story,\" said Martin.\n\nBev Tosh, left, and Lynn Martin, right, are children of war brides and forged a close friendship after meeting at a war brides reunion.

Marcello Oddo told court the man in the driver's seat, Winnipeg police Const. Leslie McRae, then 41 and a 10-year veteran of the Winnipeg police, had bloodshot and watery eyes, slurred his speech and appeared disoriented.\n\n\"Once I opened the door, there was this overwhelming smell of liquor coming from the vehicle,\" Oddo said Thursday in a Winnipeg courtroom.\n\nMcRae was arrested by Oddo in November 2017 and charged in January with impaired care and control of a vehicle and refusing a breath sample. The latter charge was withdrawn by Brandon-based Crown Attorney Brett Rach in September.\n\nMcRae has pleaded not guilty to the charge of impaired care and control of a vehicle. He was one of five Winnipeg police officers arrested for similar offences in 2017.\n\nHe previously appeared in court in September, before provincial court associate chief Judge John P. Guy. The trial was delayed, however, when Rach said he'd expected the case to appear before a judge from outside of Winnipeg.\n\nThe trial again hit a snag Thursday, when Rach and McRae's defence lawyer Evan Roitenberg arrived in court expecting an out-of-town judge and instead found provincial court senior Judge Robin A. Finlayson, of Winnipeg.\n\nAfter leaving to speak to clerks, Rach and Roitenberg said they hadn't been informed the request for an outside-of-Winnipeg judge had been denied by a chief judge who determined it was not required.\n\nOddo was the only witness called on Thursday. He testified about McRae's behaviour leading up to and following his arrest. During cross-examination, Roitenberg focused on details left out of Oddo's notes taken on the day that appeared in his testimony and the absence of any audio or video recordings of the encounter.\n\nRCMP officer saw Winnipeg police member lift can to face in car, court hears\n\nIn his testimony, Oddo said his shift started at 8 a.m. on Nov. 20, and he encountered McRae in the vehicle roughly 10 to 15 minutes later while driving westbound down the Trans-Canada Highway. McRae's vehicle was stationary and parked on the shoulder of the eastbound lanes, court heard.\n\nOddo testified he had slowed somewhat as he passed McRae's vehicle and observed an individual reclined in the driver's seat bring a can to their face as if drinking \u2014 although he couldn't see the individual's face.\n\nOddo told court he drove approximately 200 to 300 metres to a break in the highway where he made a U-turn and returned to McRae's vehicle, where he parked, got out and approached. He said he observed a can on the ground on the passenger-side of the vehicle and then knocked on a window.\n\nWhen there was no response, court heard, Oddo said he opened the driver-side door, which he found was not latched shut. He told court he identified himself as a police officer and McRae said he was resting before going home. Oddo testified McRae's eyes were bloodshot and watery, and his speech was slurred.\n\nOddo said he asked for McRae's licence and registration, and testified McRae appeared to have difficulty accessing them as well as sitting up from his reclined position \u2014 although Roitenberg highlighted during cross-examination his notes from the day don't include those details.\n\n\"He was reaching for the steering wheel and in doing so, he was clenching his hands before he reached the steering wheel,\" Oddo said. \"Eventually he got himself up.\"\n\nAt one point, Oddo testified, McRae told him he'd \"had a couple beers.\"\n\nOddo told the court that McRae identified himself as a Winnipeg police officer and said McRae told him that \"common courtesy\" was to drive him home. He also testified that upon returning to the detachment, McRae told him he'd been \"in [his] shoes before\" and made a different choice, and said, \"You have a different approach than we do.\"\n\nDefence questions notes, testimony\n\nDefence laywer Roitenberg pressed Oddo on several details he added in his testimony that did not appear in his notes from the day. He asked about the distance between their vehicles when he first saw McRae and saying that without seeing his face, Oddo can't have seen McRae drinking.\n\nHe suggested McRae's comment about Oddo driving him home was McRae indicating to Oddo that he was not intoxicated, but if Oddo was concerned, he could drive him home.\n\nRoitenberg questioned Oddo's testimony that McRae had said he'd had beer, as well, asking Oddo to recall the exact wording McRae had used. He referenced a written note Oddo had added to his notebook following the arrest that didn't specify exactly what McRae said.\n\nHe also pushed back on Oddo on the lack of any recording of their interaction at the detachment, which is ordinarily recorded. Oddo said he was unable to produce one and he'd never been required to produce such a recording in the past.\n\nJudge Finlayson adjourned the trial around 4 p.m. It will resume on Nov. 29.\n\nWith files from Bryce Hoye", "A senior living in South Surrey who was saved by a microwave technician's timely intervention was released from hospital Thursday.\n\nThe elderly man had been lying on the floor of his home for several days before the technician found him.\n\nFernando Solano, a senior technician at Han Appliances, was scheduled to install a new microwave at the home of 85-year-old Charles Ferraby on Sept. 18.\n\nWhen Solano arrived at the house, there was no answer to his repeated knocking at the door or to several phone calls throughout the morning.\n\n\"Usually when that happens to me, I just put our card and what time we were there to reschedule,\" said the repairman.\n\nBut on that day, he had a feeling that he shouldn't move on to his next installation.\n\n\"I sat down in the truck, turned on the car \u2026 I had this feeling that I had to go back.\"\n\nSolano went back to knock on the door once again.

An amendment from the UCP asking for a 40-year ban met the same fate.\n\nBut the government had a change of heart on Thursday. Health Minister Sarah Hoffman brought forward an amendment for a lifetime ban and asked her NDP colleagues to vote in favour.\n\nHoffman said the original bill with a five-year ban was modelled after Ontario, the only other province to have such legislation.\n\nHoffman said the government had concerns about legal challenges, but after talking with survivors and legal counsel she decided to go further with the bill.\n\n\"Even if it means that we're forging new territory, cutting new turf, that we send a very clear message -- the days of impunity are over, that by far we're going to have the strictest laws in Canada,\" Hoffman said.\n\nAs for legal challenges, Hoffman said the government will have to wait and see as no other Canadian jurisdiction has taken this step.\n\nMcPherson said a five-year ban sends a weak message to survivors. She is glad the government finally came around on a lifetime ban but she is disappointed it took so much effort.\n\n\"This is what's needed. It takes so much courage for a survivor to come forward whether it's to the police or a tribunal or even a therapist,\" she said. \"So this encourages people who have been sexually assaulted to come forward.\"\n\nAlberta Party MLA Karen McPherson was the first MLA to propose a lifetime ban on physicians who sexually abuse their patients. Her amendment was voted down early in the debate on Bill 21. The government had a change of heart on Thursday and added a lifetime ban to the bill. (CBC )\n\nHealth professionals found guilty of sexual misconduct will face a range of penalties. They include licence suspension, cancellation with a five-year wait to reapply or a lifetime ban.\n\nThe legislation comes after a high-profile case in Edmonton involving a physician who had his practice licence reinstated even though he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a patient and a nurse.\n\nThe College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta said it was limited by law about what it could do. It placed conditions on Dr. Ismail Taher, including having a chaperone in the room when he is seeing a female patient.\n\nAn Act to Protect Patients gives the 29 colleges and associations that regulate health professions new power to keep members found guilty of sexual assault and sexual misconduct away from patients.\n\nSome of the other professionals covered by the bill include dentists, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers, pharmacists and psychologists.", "The president of St. Boniface Hospital argues the centre's neonatal unit has been overworked for years, and that's putting the care of newborns at risk.\n\nMartine Bouchard wrote in a letter to the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority that the repercussions of \"chronic overcapacity\" can have life-altering effects.\n\n\"The consequences of inadequate access to neonatal intensive care can range from profound physical and neurological compromise to learning and social problems,\" read the letter, which Bouchard wrote earlier this fall and which was presented by the NDP during question period at the Manitoba Legislature on Thursday.\n\nThe neonatal intensive care unit has not experienced a funding increase since early in the decade, while the number of babies admitted into its care has risen 7.5 per cent, said the Sept. 26, 2018, letter, which stated nurses are being spread thin and that's leading to mandatory overtime.\n\nThe letter, which asked for an increase in funding to address overcapacity, also said there is a 42 per cent increase in the number of babies experiencing symptoms of drug addiction since last year.\n\nIt also made reference to four neonatal deaths, saying they were possibly the result of the strain on staffing, but St. Boniface Hospital said in an email Thursday the deaths dated back to 2009 to 2012. The WRHA stated none of the deaths were related to resource or staffing issues.\n\nLongstanding concern: Pallister\n\nManitoba Premier Brian Pallister said in the legislative chamber the former government sat back as these problems worsened, but he's responding.\n\n\"That's a longstanding concern that was unaddressed by the previous NDP government,\" he said. \"We're addressing it.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the province announced $3.2 million to hire 30 new nurses and fund 11 additional beds at the neonatal units at St. Boniface and Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg.\n\nNDP Leader Wab Kinew flagged the letter as another example of Tory cuts to the province's health-care system, pointing to a spike in overtime hours and patients affected by drug use.\n\n\"The understaffing at the neonatal unit is actually causing a domino effect that is impacting other departments at the hospital,\" he said. \"The government has been slow to respond, but even their response to date doesn't really address the impact.\"\n\nLiberal Leader Dougald Lamont said the province shouldn't discount the concerns of nurses worried about mandatory overtime by saying the overall rate is actually falling.\n\n\"That's like calling 911 and saying 'my house is on fire,' and the operator says, 'Well, fires on average are down,'\" he said. \"That's been the response from this government on this and a ton of other issues.\"\n\nFunding increase\n\nBouchard's letter also indicated that sometimes patients cannot be diverted from one neonatal unit to the other because both are at capacity.\n\n\"This presents an even larger risk to patient safety because in actuality it means that both sites are overcapacity.\"\n\nThe letter shows that overtime levels peaked at nearly 800 hours every two weeks this summer, which more than doubled any biweekly period in 2017.\n\nSince then, however, the province has pledged $3.2 million in funding, which a spokesperson from St. Boniface Hospital said would go a long way toward relieving pressure on the unit.\n\nManitoba Nurses Union president Darlene Jackson is not celebrating.\n\nShe said the funding increase only covers the basics and does not entirely ease the pressure on workers.\n\n\"As far as I'm concerned, funding baseline staffing levels is the minimum that this government should be committing themselves to do,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"They delayed for months and now they're congratulating themselves, patting themselves on the back for providing minimum funding for a crisis.\"\n\nJackson added it would take six to eight months to properly train the nurses.\n\nWith files from Susan Magas.", "It's another busy weekend for arts and entertainment in Calgary.\n\nFor those looking to fill a few holes in their calendar, The Homestretch's Susan Holzman has a few options to keep you busy.\n\nMusic of the 40s\n\nMusic of the 40s is being presented by the Foothills Brass Quintet on Sunday.

His body was found the following spring, in a wooded area near a hydro line, just days after his family issued a public plea for information regarding his whereabouts.\n\nBaker pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last December for his role in Brophy's death, and agreed to testify against Thomas and Linklater as part of a plea bargain.\n\nVictim taken to secluded area, beaten to death\n\nDuring his nearly four hours in court Thursday, Baker told a jury that he, along with Thomas and Linklater, led Brophy into a wooded area, where the teen was choked and beaten to death with a metal baton.\n\nThe 22-year-old appeared in court before Justice Chris Martin in a grey T-shirt and with a shaved head.\n\nSpeaking quickly, and often gazing down at this feet, he described in detail what led up to the three men approaching Brophy the night of Sept. 8, 2015.\n\nBaker said he knew the victim from school, that they played basketball and soccer together, and that he remembers Brophy as a good athlete.\n\nOn the night Brophy died, Baker said he was at home when Linklater and Thomas came to his apartment in the northern Manitoba city of Thompson. He told them he was tired and didn't want to hang out, but they convinced him to let them inside.\n\nThey were drinking heavily that night, he said while being questioned by Crown prosecutor Brian Wilford.\n\n'Let's go get him'\n\nAt one point, Thomas pulled a large butcher knife out of Baker's cupboard and said, \"We'll use this,\" the witness alleged, to which Linklater replied, \"That's not how it's going to go down.\"\n\nBaker also said Thomas had been showing off a large, metal baton while at this apartment.\n\nLater, the three men left for a walk, Baker told the court. Near the Giant Tiger store in Thompson, Thomas and Linklater spotted Brophy, Baker said.\n\nLinklater said, \"Let's go get him,\" Baker told the court.\n\nBaker said Linklater told Thomas to accost Brophy, while instructing Baker to be on the lookout. Thomas then robbed the victim, taking his cellphone, wallet and glasses, and restrained him by holding onto this arm, Baker said.\n\nThe victim kept asking Thomas to let him go, repeatedly saying that they already took all of his belongings, Baker testified.\n\n'Our first murder'\n\nHe said as the three men led Brophy down the street, with Thomas walking a few feet ahead with Brophy, Linklater punched Baker in the head and said, \"We're going to do our first murder.\"\n\nThey led the victim past a trailer park, down a trail into a wooded area.\n\nWhen they got there, Linklater used a shoelace to try to strangle Brophy, but was unsuccessful, according to the testimony. The three men took turns punching Brophy repeatedly, before Thomas pulled out a metal baton and struck Brophy at least 10 to 15 times, Baker said.\n\nHe admitted that he also took turns hitting Brophy with the baton, but said it was only because Linklater threatened him.\n\nGang initiation\n\nOn Monday, the first day of the trial, Crown prosecutors said they intended to prove Brophy was murdered as part of a gang initiation.\n\nBaker told the court he wasn't involved in any gangs at the time, but did say that Thomas was asking him \"who I was down with\" on the night of Brophy death.\n\n\"Which means, if I was part of a gang or anything,\" he said.\n\nHe also said that before they left the apartment, Linklater punched him and Thomas about 50 times in the stomach, which he took as some type of gang initiation, \"because they usually beat you up first.\"\n\nBefore his involvement in Brophy's death, Baker said he was planning to join the army, having been an air cadet since his teens. He had been under the care of Child and Family Service since he was 16.\n\nHe also told the court that he was jumped by seven men a few months ago while serving his sentence at Stony Mountain Institution, which he said he suspects was connected to his agreement to testify.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Linklater's defence lawyer Bruce Bonney argued that Baker was nervous about what might happen if police found out he was involved in Brophy's murder.\n\nHe also pointed out that Baker spoke with his lawyer about reaching some type of immunity agreement in exchange for his cooperation with police as early as 2016, and that he gave a different name for Linklater during one of his first statements to police.\n\nBaker said he only did that because he was nervous about Linklater coming after him.\n\nThe trial continues Friday.", "In less than two weeks, a Progressive Conservative throne speech will be read in the New Brunswick legislature, and representatives from the four political parties are in agreement about some elements they expect and hope to hear.\n\nFor instance, the speech will likely address the priorities of all parties and strike a collaborative tone.

The People's Alliance, which holds three seats, has said it will prop up a Tory government for 18 months.\n\nAlliance Leader Kris Austin said his MLAs have a free vote on the issue of fracking.\n\nAustin himself said on the podcast he's not opposed to allowing fracking in specific areas and that it would be \"irresponsible\" to defeat a throne speech on a \"vague\" notion of shale gas.\n\nThe party leader added that market conditions indicate it probably isn't the best time to extract shale gas anyway.\n\nThe Tories hope to allow fracking in certain areas, like Sussex, by Christmas.\n\nOpposition parties are also interested to hear whether the throne speech will touch on climate change.\n\n\"We've got 12 years now to actually significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels,\" said Coon.\n\nThe deadline Coon mentioned is from a damning United Nations report that suggests the planet will reach the crucial temperature that would precipitate extreme weather and food shortages.\n\nMcKee said he wants to hear what the Tories have in store to address climate change.

Meng became the organization's president in November 2016.\n\nChinese authorities said they detained Meng, 64, on bribery charges, though his wife has described him as a victim of political persecution. He was China's vice-minister of public security and appears to be the latest ranking Chinese official to have been caught in a sweeping purge under President Xi Jinping.\n\nStock said his organization learned of Meng's disappearance on Oct. 5 via media reports that came out after Meng's wife said she had not heard from him since the end of September and reported him missing.\n\nInterpol contacted Beijing, asking for clarification, according to Stock. A high-level Chinese delegation arrived at Interpol's Lyon headquarters on Oct. 7, reported that Meng had written a resignation letter and advised that he was no longer a delegate from China to Interpol \u2014 meaning he could no longer serve as president.\n\nChina's Interpol office transmitted the resignation letter to Interpol headquarters later that day. Pressed on whether Interpol had assurances Meng actually wrote it or did so without duress, Stock hedged.\n\n\"There was no reason for me to (suspect) that anything was forced or wrong,\" he said.\n\nInterpol appeared to accept the Chinese delegation's explanation at face value and publicly announced that night that Meng had stepped down, without commenting on why or what happened.\n\nStock cited the structure and nature of the 192-member organization, which provides a platform for member nations to share information on criminal activities, and the vast needs it fulfills in trying to contain ballooning transnational crime. Interpol databases are queried 200 times each second by police around the world, he said.\n\n\"We are a rules-based organization. That is very important to understand,\" Stock said, adding that the role of Interpol is \"not to govern over member states.\"\n\n\"We are not an investigative body,\" he said.\n\nStock said he is in \"constant\" contact with the national central bureau in Beijing that serves as Interpol's point of contact in China. As secretary general, Stock manages Interpol's day-to-day activities, while the agency's elected president has a less hands-on, more symbolic role.\n\n\"We are strongly encouraging China\" to come forth with details of Meng's case, Stock said. He suggested Chinese officials would \"when the right moment comes.\n\n'Regrettable situation'\n\nMeng's wife, Grace Meng, told The Associated Press last month that she received threats after her husband disappeared. She and their two children are under police protection in Lyon.\n\n\"There is no doubt this is a very regrettable situation,\" Stock said. \"But on the other hand, we have to ensure day-to-day operations ... continue.\"\n\nHe also conceded that Interpol must \"mitigate negative impact\" springing from Meng's disappearance.\n\nInterpol acts as a clearinghouse for national police services that want to hunt down suspects outside their borders.

Care Providers Association.\n\n\"We have quite a few care providers around the province that are pretty close to the line in terms of their bottom line. If the costs go up much more, we are going to see them in a situation where they cannot sustain their operation.\"\n\nDix acknowledged contract flipping was being used to reduce operating costs and says more funding may be needed for the system without the practice.\n\n\"There is nothing inherent in the legislation that increases costs, but what we are taking away is the right of health authorities and contractors to drive down wages,\" he said.\n\nThe legislation will not go into effect immediately after it is passed, Dix said, allowing time to work with health authorities and for-profit providers on how to make the necessary adjustments.", "A woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries Thursday after being struck by a vehicle in Brampton, police say.\n\nEmergency crews were called to the area of Creditview Road and James Potter Road just after 6:30 p.m.\n\nThe driver of the car remained on the scene, police say.\n\nJames Potter Road is closed between Creditview Road and Bonavista Drive.\n\nThe Major Collision Bureau is investigating.", "The five companies that dominate the oilsands industry have remained \"incredibly profitable\" despite low oil prices and delays in building new pipelines, according to a report from the Parkland Institute.\n\n\"Despite the 2014 oil price crash and the ongoing hand-wringing over pipelines and the price differential, the reality is that the big five oilsands producers have remained incredibly profitable corporations,\" said Ian Hussey, lead author of a report released Thursday by Parkland Institute and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives.\n\nLast year alone, the companies banked or paid out to shareholders a total of $13.5 billion, he said.\n\n\"These companies have been able to continue to transfer sizeable amounts of money to their shareholders or to their bank accounts, while at the same time in 2015 cutting almost 20,000 jobs from the Alberta economy,\" Hussey said.\n\nThe report analyzed the business economics of Suncor Energy, Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy, Imperial Oil, and Husky Energy, who together produce 80 per cent of Canada's bitumen.\n\nThe economic numbers used in the study included a 10-year oil boom from 2004 to 2014, when prices were high, and the bust period from 2014 to 2016, he said.\n\n\"They've been able to continue to pay out high dividends to their shareholders when they're crying poor to the public and in the media,\" Hussey said.\n\nFrom 2009-17, the five companies paid $31.76 billion in dividends to shareholders, including $12.56 billion since the oil price crash in late 2014, the report said.\n\nIn 2017, the companies transferred to shareholders $4.16 billion in dividends and $2.04 billion in share buy backs, it said.\n\nAt the same time, the companies had residual savings of $7.3 billion, while paying out $4.72 billion in taxes and royalties to all levels of government.\n\nIndustry response\n\nThose in Canada's oil industry say the comparison of money paid to shareholders and money paid to governments in taxes and royalties shows the system is fair.\n\n\"Both companies and the governments are sharing in the benefits of the development, which is actually quite consistent with the nature of the royalty and resource development system that was built in Alberta,\" said Ben Brunnen with Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. \"So I would sort of make the case that we see here is an example of the system working quite well.\"\n\nBrunnen said it's important for oil companies in Alberta to reward their shareholders, or investors will go elsewhere.\n\n\"We live in a very competitive market for capital, and that money has been leaving this country,\" he said.\n\nThe aggregate gross profit of the five companies in 2017 was $46.6 billion, which was close to the Alberta government's revenues of $47.3 billion, the report said.\n\nThe multinational corporations \u2014 all with significant assets in the U.S.\u2014 have been able to shift their operations in response to market conditions to ensure they remain profitable, Hussey said.\n\nThe data used in the report was gleaned from \"dozens of data sets,\" including company annual reports and Statistics Canada, he said.\n\nParkland Institute is a public policy research institute at the University of Alberta.", "A video distributed by the Trump administration to support its argument for banning CNN reporter Jim Acosta from the White House appears to have been doctored to make Acosta look more aggressive than he was during an exchange with a White House intern, an independent expert said Thursday.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted the video, which shows Acosta asking a question to U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday as the intern tries to take his microphone away. But a frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident shows that the one tweeted by Sanders appears to have been altered to speed up Acosta's arm movement as he touches the intern's arm, according to Abba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the footage at the AP's request.\n\nYou can watch the video White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted here:\n\nWe stand by our decision to revoke this individual\u2019s hard pass.

The tweeted video also does not have any audio, which Shapiro said would make it easier to alter.\n\nSanders, who has not said where the tweeted video came from, said it clearly shows Acosta made contact with the intern.\n\nWhile the origin of the manipulated video is unclear, its distribution marked a new low for an administration that has been criticized for its willingness to mislead.\n\n'Deceptive, dangerous and unethical'\n\nThe White House News Photographers Association decried the sharing of the video.\n\n\"As visual journalists, we know that manipulating images is manipulating truth,\" said Whitney Shefte, the association's president. \"It's deceptive, dangerous and unethical. Knowingly sharing manipulated images is equally problematic, particularly when the person sharing them is a representative of our country's highest office with vast influence over public opinion.\"\n\n\"The irony of this White House video involving Jim Acosta is that if it is found to be doctored, it will show the administration to be doing what it accuses the news media of doing \u2014 engaging in fake information,\" said Aly Colon, a professor in journalism ethics at Washington & Lee University.\n\n'Enshrined in the First Amendment'\n\nCNN has labelled Sanders' characterization of Acosta's exchange with the intern a lie. Its position has been supported by witnesses including Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who was next to Acosta during the news conference and tweeted that he did not see Acosta place his hands on the White House employee. Rather, he said he saw him holding on to the microphone as she reached for it.\n\nSeveral journalists and organizations \u2014 including the American Society of News Editors, the Associated Press Media Editors and the Online News Association \u2014 demanded Acosta's press pass be reinstated.\n\n\"It is the essential function of a free press in every democracy to independently gather and report information in the public interest, a right that is enshrined in the First Amendment,\" said Julie Pace, AP's Washington bureau chief. \"We strongly reject the idea that any administration would block a journalist's access to the White House.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to CNN journalist Jim Acosta during a news conference in the East Room of the White House Wednesday. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nThe New York Times editorialized in favour of restoring Acosta's pass, saying it signaled Trump's view that asking hard questions disqualifies reporters from attending briefings.

Greg Gianforte of Montana, who was sentenced to anger management classes and community service for body-slamming a Guardian reporter last spring?\"\n\nIt's unusual for the White House to pull the so-called hard passes from journalists. During Lyndon Johnson's presidency, the Secret Service denied clearance to Robert Sherrill, a reporter for The Nation who had gotten into physical fights with government officials. During the George W. Bush presidency, Trude Feldman, who worked for various news outlets, was suspended for 90 days after security cameras recorded her looking through a press aide's desk late one night. In the 1970s, President Nixon tried to get Washington Post reporters banned from the White House.\n\nAri Fleischer, White House press secretary under George W. Bush, said on Fox News Channel Thursday that it appeared Acosta had made incidental contact with the intern and that it didn't appear to be a justifiable reason to pull his pass.\n\nDespite losing his White House pass, Acosta is expected to travel to Paris this weekend to cover Trump's trip to meet with world leaders.", "The flu virus has been hitting Calgary harder than other regions of the province so far this season, according to numbers released Thursday by Alberta Health Services.\n\nThere have been 510 confirmed cases of influenza A in Alberta since Aug. 31, with 340 of those diagnosed in Calgary.
