Can I guarantee to you that we're going to do that? No, there's slowdowns in projects, there's slowdowns with suppliers, there's changes in scope. Things change,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm hoping to get it below $1 billion. I'm not committing to getting it to below $1 billion. ... We're driving projects to get it as low as possible and spend funds efficiently and effectively. We're not wasting money.\"\n\n'It's not good to have delays\u200b'\n\nThe government spent $2.3 billion less than planned last year. That was also largely because of delays in projects such as the government's multibillion-dollar plan to buy new warships, though also because some things ended up costing less than expected.\n\nThe government does deserve credit for having increased investments in equipment to levels not seen since the height of the war in Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011, said defence analyst David Perry of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.\n\n\"And if they can actually move as much as the deputy (minister) was saying, and they only leave $1 billion on the table, that will be the best year in the last several decades,\" said Perry, who has previously warned that delays in the procurement system could derail the defence policy.\n\n\"But there are a bunch of impacts from not being able to spend money on schedule. One is you don't have the actual gear to do what you want. And project budgets lose purchasing power when money is not spent on schedule. So it's not good to have delays.\"", "The Supreme Court has said it won't hear a case involving an Indigenous hunter and questions around his ability to hunt on unmarked, privately owned lands.\n\nIn 2015, Kristjan Pierone, an Indigenous hunter from Manitoba, shot and killed a moose at the bottom of a dry slough near Swift Current one day before moose hunting season started.\n\nPierone did not have a licence to hunt moose and did not have permission from the landowner to do so.

When the band was on the road, Crippin would ask that his hotel room be booked in a different wing, away from the rest of the band.\n\nWhere was management?\n\nCrippin says anyone who worked closely with Hoggard, including the band's management team, would have also seen warning signs in the singer's behaviour.\n\nFor example, Hoggard's \"shock humour,\" as Crippin calls it, was not only misogynist, but racist and homophobic as well.\n\nCrippin provided CBC News with several offensive group emails Hoggard sent dating back to 2012.

Never Faget.\"\u200b\n\nCrippin says Hoggard routinely called him a \"f--got.\"\n\nHe also says Hoggard would show the band and crew members videos and photos on his phone of naked women the singer had been with. It would often occur backstage, Crippin says, or while they were travelling to interviews or back to the hotel.\n\nIn September, an anonymous Hedley fan sent CBC a video that appears to have been filmed by Hoggard in an airplane washroom. The clip begins by focusing on Hoggard's face, then pans down to show him exposing himself and masturbating. Crippin says he was sent the same unsolicited video just before he left the band.\n\nHe considered Hoggard's behaviour \"harassment.\" Hoggard was \"trying to get a rise\" out of him, Crippin said, so he tried his best to ignore it.\u200b\n\nCBC has confirmed that Hoggard also sent the six-second clip to the Ottawa woman who has accused the singer of rape.

He says he became sick from stress and anxiety while on tour in the spring of 2016.\n\nNot long after, he realized he wanted out of the band, but his lawyer advised him that getting fired would result in a bigger settlement than if he were to quit.

I was praying for strength and to find the right words ... Now, with this ceremony today, that moment in my life came full circle.\"\n\nThirty-three feathers, harvested by the Mi'kmaq in their ancestral territory of Mi'kma'ki, were blessed and presented to the Nova Scotia Judiciary for use in every main courthouse in the province.

She talked about the posters, the message and how we should react to them with CBC Manitoba's Information Radio host Marcy Markusa on Thursday. Their conversation has been edited for length.\n\nMarcy Markusa: How innocent is that phrase, 'It's OK to be white?'\n\nLori Wilkinson: It's not remarkable, right? It's quite a clever statement because in and of itself, if you just read it you say, \"Oh, it's OK to be white,\" but the impression, or what the message implies, is that the other part of that sentence that's not there is not being white is not OK \u2014 that's the other end of the message.\n\nWhat do you say to people who suggest that this is somehow just celebrating being white in a world where people may somehow feel discriminated against if they're white?\n\nWe have to look at where the posters were placed and who received the messages. So if you look at where this happened at the university, they were heavily postered around the women and gender department, the Native studies department, in places where international students and Indigenous students congregate in large numbers. They weren't posted in places where these people don't tend to be.\n\nHow common is the belief that white people are the victim of racism and discrimination?\n\nI wouldn't say it's not uncommon, but I wouldn't say it's common either. People who think that white people are discriminated against are part of a group who have had a long history of being underprivileged themselves. There are another group of people who maybe hasn't been underprivileged, and they believe that society is more or less equal \u2014 if you work hard, you get a job and you obey the laws and you pay your taxes, everything will turn out all right. That group of people too maybe doesn't understand how hard it is to get out of poverty and that many white people are poor too.\n\nWhy lash out at other groups?\n\nIt's very easy to propagate myths and stereotypes about people who are not like you and so, if you look at who uses the message, \"It's OK to be white,\" these are groups of people that propagate ideas that Western civilization is under threat by immigration, for instance. This is also the group of people who want to use these messages to silence people who are working in diversity, multicultural and multi-faith communities, who are working toward equality.\n\nCan there be prejudice against white people?\u200b\n\nI think there can. I think what we're seeing with these messages is what has been a long time failure by researchers\u2026 politicians, by people in power in order to recognize that privilege isn't just about the colour of your skin. There's other ways to be underprivileged in our society.\n\nSome people might think the best response to these kinds of events is to ignore them and not give perpetrators the attention. What's your response to that?\n\nI think the worst thing that we can do is to sit back and do nothing, because it lets this group of people send out this message uncriticized.\n\nWhat do you think of this online claim that this was merely a trolling campaign designed to expose post-secondary institutions and the media?\n\nWe have to be very careful when we talk about these kinds of messages because it's not a simple, \"Oh, this is directly racist\" \u2014 it's unconsciously racist. It gets us talking about these things and gives racist people a little bit of fodder to criticize us, but I think the more we talk about these things and the more people learn, the less often that we face these problems.", "When Simone Micheletti heard the sound of lions roaring in the distance on Tuesday night, he didn't think much of it.\n\nHe owns and lives in the Serondela Lodge in Namibia, right alongside a national park that is teeming with African wildlife.\n\nBut the next day, he got a call from a neighbour about a massive pile of dead buffalo in the nearby river, so he went to take a look for himself.\n\n\"The scene was really bad.

And there's still no final call about a hotly contested Senate race in Arizona.\n\nAs Georgia's top election official, Kemp oversaw the race, a marquee contest in the nation's midterms. His resignation Thursday morning came as a hearing began for a lawsuit in which five voters asked that he be barred from exercising his duties in any future management of his own election tally.\n\nIt is grossly unfair to any fox in America to compare Brian Kemp with a fox guarding the hen house.

Voting rights groups and prominent Democrats accused the Republican of using his position to suppress minority votes, an allegation he strongly denied.\n\nPreviously, Abrams had pointed to ballots that had yet to be counted in metro Atlanta counties where she won a large share of the vote. Her campaign has said she must pick up about 15,000 votes to secure a runoff in December.\n\nKemp said Abrams is using \"old math.\" Without providing specifics, he said in a WSB Radio interview that the number \"is actually more like 30,000 votes.\"\n\nAt a news conference with Republican Gov. Nathan Deal late Thursday morning, Kemp declared that there are only about 20,000 provisional ballots that have not yet been counted in the race. He did not offer any details, but in response to a question said he would ask about releasing county-by-county results.\n\nOf Abrams, Kemp said, \"Even if she got 100 per cent of those votes, we still win.\"\n\nKemp, right, trails outgoing Georgia Gov.

The office had not immediately shared that requested information the day before, however, even as Kemp's campaign cited the statewide estimate as his justification for declaring victory.\n\nThe standoff continued to attract attention around the country, with the head of the Democratic National Committee applauding Abrams for pressing on and blasting Kemp as untrustworthy.\n\n\"It is grossly unfair to any fox in America to compare Brian Kemp with a fox guarding the hen house. It is much worse in Georgia,\" DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in Washington. \"I don't think that race is over. Every vote must be counted, and the integrity of that election is at stake.\"\n\nEarlier battle over voter registrations\n\nLate Wednesday afternoon \u2014 after a day of the campaigns, news outlets and partisan observers scrambling for information about outstanding votes across Georgia's 159 counties \u2014 Kemp aide Ryan Mahoney told reporters on a conference call, \"We are declaring victory.\" Campaign official Austin Chambers added: \"The message here is pretty simple: This election is over, and the results are clear.\"\n\nIf a runoff is necessary, it will take place Dec. 4, extending Abrams's bid to become the first black woman elected governor in American history, while Kemp looks to maintain the GOP's domination in a state where Democrats haven't won a governor's race since 1998.\n\nLast month, the Associated Press reported more than 53,000 voter applications were on hold with Kemp's office ahead of the election. Nearly 70 per cent of those registrations were from black applicants.\n\nKemp said he was merely following state law. He said the Georgians on the \"pending\" list could still vote by bringing a proper ID that matches their registration information, to resolve the issue in person.\n\nMany of the 53,000 wound up on the list for failing Georgia's \"exact match\" verification process. A judge issued a restraining order preventing Kemp's office from throwing out absentee ballots where a resident's signature didn't exactly match the signature on their voter registration card.\n\nPaper backup lacking\n\nAdding to the concerns leading up to the midterms is that Georgia is one of just a handful of states that do no use a verifiable paper backup with their electronic voting system. Georgia's direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machines have drawn criticism from various advocacy groups and federal agencies, including U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials, who called the systems a \"national security concern.\"\n\nVoting rights groups and individual voters sued Georgia officials in 2017, alleging that the electronic machines are highly vulnerable to hacking and cannot be audited or verified. A judge in September said there wasn't enough time to agree to their request to require paper ballots for the midterm vote, although the suit was allowed to proceed.\n\nFrom left, election workers Shantell Black and Elections Deputy Director Kristi Royston open and scan absentee ballots on Nov. 7 in Lawrenceville, Ga. There were serious questions raised ahead of the contest over Kemp's apparent conflict of interest, voter registrations and the vote-counting technology used. (John Spink/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nThe lawsuit at issue Thursday morning in an Atlanta federal court came from voters who sued Kemp on Election Day alleging that his presiding over an election in which he is a candidate \"violates a basic notion of fairness.\" The plaintiffs asked the court to block Kemp from having anything more to do with managing his election. The hearing ended shortly after it began with the announcement of Kemp's resignation.\n\nWith reported votes exceeding 3.9 million \u2014 almost 95 per cent of Georgia's 2016 presidential turnout \u2014 Kemp has just more than 50 per cent.\n\nIn 2016, with a slightly larger electorate, there were 16,739 provisional ballots. Of those, 7,592 were counted. State and campaign officials said they expected a much higher proportion to be counted this year.\n\nIt's not immediately clear what Kemp's practical role was in the election tally. Local officials are responsible for counting the votes, including provisional ballots. County officials have until next Tuesday to certify their results and send them to Kemp's office. Statewide certification must come by Nov. 20.", "Central American migrants in a caravan that has stopped in Mexico City demanded buses Thursday to take them to the U.S. border, saying it is too cold and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking.\n\nMexico City authorities say that of the 4,841 registered migrants receiving shelter in a sports complex, 1,726 are under the age of 18, including 310 children under five.\n\n\"We need buses to continue travelling,\" said Milton Benitez, a caravan coordinator.

Women who sext often say they do it to please a partner, or enhance intimacy. For men, it is frequently a strategy to \"satisfy sexual needs while keeping their partners at a distance.\"\n\nPeople with high self-esteem are less likely to send nude photos or videos. Those prone to risky sexual behaviours are more apt to overshare. Alcohol and the use of illicit substances also play a role.\n\nIs there something unique about politicians?\n\nItalian research suggests that they use social media in a different way than the average person \u2014 primarily for self-promotion and public signalling, rather than seeking support and community.\n\nAnd when it comes to decision-making, elected officials tend to behave differently from the general public.

Yet they, too, fall prey to the \"reflection effect\" \u2014 being unduly influenced by whether an option is framed as a \"win\" or a \"loss,\" especially in the context of votes.\n\nPeople with high self-esteem are less likely to send nude photos or videos, while those prone to risky sexual behaviour are more apt to overshare, according to studies. (Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhere politicians appear to really differ is in their ego.\n\nCompared to other professions, legislators score extremely high on the leadership and authority scale, expressing qualities like warmth, extroversion and social boldness. But they are also far more narcissistic, deft at manipulating others to achieve their goals and highly social, with a preference for activities that involve informing, training and developing others.\n\nAnd the higher the office a politician attains, generally the greater his or her sense of self-confidence and resistance to criticism.\n\nIn that context, perhaps sending a recent acquaintance, or even total stranger, nude photos of yourself is simply an unnatural extension of what makes politicians tick.\n\nBut it remains an incredibly foolhardy behaviour \u2014 if only because voters tend to take special notice of that kind of outreach.\n\nPoliticians behaving badly\n\nTonight's At Issue panel tackles improper behaviour and sexual misconduct in Canadian politics, writes Rosemary Barton.\n\n\n\nSometimes it's not a week that seems like a long time in politics, it's just 24 hours.\n\n\n\nIt has certainly felt like that since yesterday.\n\n\n\nIn the midst of preparing for many hours of coverage of the American midterms on Tuesday afternoon, some Canadian political news broke that could not be ignored. Former Conservative MP Tony Clement announced he was stepping aside from many of his committee duties.\n\nThe reason was surprising, to say the least. Clement admitted he had sent sexually explicit videos and photos to someone he believed to be a consenting woman.\n\n\n\nIn fact, it was apparently an extortionist, who then asked Clement to pay some 50,000 euros or see the videos and photos released publicly.\n\n\n\nThings got worse for Clement on Wednesday when he was also asked to leave Conservative caucus, because leader Andrew Scheer believed there was enough evidence to indicate the sexually explicit messages were not an isolated incident.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer delivers a statement in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday.

To make sense of how international relations could change, The National is hosting a special conversation tonight in front of a live audience \u2014 both in person in our Toronto studio and digitally via Facebook. We're bringing together Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, top Washington Post journalists Aaron Blake and Karoun Demirjian, The National co-hosts Adrienne Arsenault and Rosemary Barton, as well as CBC's senior Washington correspondent Keith Boag. Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland at a news conference at the Embassy of Canada in Washington on Aug. 31. (Chris Wattie/Reuters) We'll tackle the state of the relationship between the two countries, and explore what Canada can learn ahead of next year's federal election.\u200b Freeland will be interviewed live on stage by Rosemary Barton and Aaron Blake. As Canada's direct diplomat to the White House, where does she see the challenges, how does she plan to approach them and what will the new make-up of the House of Representatives mean for Canada's priorities going forward? Then there's the matter of the media. Blake and Demirjian face the label of \"fake news\" daily while doing their job. From congressional representatives using it as an excuse not to grant interviews, to journalists receiving death threats from the public simply for publishing an article summarizing the days events in the White House, the reality is that covering U.S. politics is becoming more challenging. But is it really so different here? There's a lot to talk about and we want your input. Watch the livestream and ask your questions through Facebook.com/thenational. We'll also be livestreaming on YouTube.com/CBCTheNational, Twitter.com/CBCTheNational, and CBCNews.ca CBC News will air a full hour of conversation tomorrow on CBC News Network at 8 p.m. ET, and highlights will be on The National tomorrow night. - Lara Chatterjee\n\nQuote of the moment\n\n\"There's no way to make sense out of the senseless.\"\n\n- Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean on a mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., last night.

And yet he's never felt as far away from the pebbled sheets as he does right now, sitting on some scaffolding inside the Tournament Centre holding an iPad.\n\nThis week in Thunder Bay, Kennedy is tracking rocks and watching Canadian teams closely as they compete in the third Grand Slam stop of the season.\n\nIt's his new gig \u2014 national team program performance consultant with Curling Canada. One of this country's finest curlers ever to grace the ice, Kennedy abruptly left the game last spring just weeks after his fourth-place finish at the Olympics with skip Kevin Koe.\n\n\"I was away from the game for about four or five months this summer. Completely away,\" Kennedy says. \"Not even having the opportunity to talk curling felt like I lost a limb. It was the longest time away from the game in my life.\"\n\nAnd it was needed, according to Kennedy. His body is a mess after spending half of his life obsessively training for the sport he loves.\n\nThe 36-year-old from St. Albert, Alta., was a curling perfectionist in every way imaginable. He would spend countless hours throwing rock after rock. He admits now it was probably to his detriment health-wise. His hip continues to give him trouble. Kennedy has hired a new team of trainers to help him rehab. It's a long, slow grind.\n\n\"There's a wear and tear problem in our sport going forward,\" Kennedy says. \"The training for certain aspects of our sport could be better, especially at a younger age.\"\n\nThe focus now for Kennedy is on getting healthy. Then, and only then, will he consider continuing his playing career.\n\n\"No one is calling,\" he says. \"I've gotten more calls from the coaching side. I think there's a lot I can give that way.\"\n\nExport, eh?\n\nMore than anything, the time away from curling has allowed Kennedy to reflect on the state of the sport \u2014 something he never had time for while he was in the throes of competition.\n\nAnd something isn't sitting well with him.\n\nHe thinks Canada is losing ground as it exports more of its coaches and curling know-how abroad.\n\n\"In my opinion, the international teams have gotten really, really good with our help,\" he says. \"I don't like seeing our curling knowledge going to other countries.\"\n\nKennedy, right, and skip Kevin Koe failed to win a medal at the 2018 Olympics.

Both the men's and women's teams failed to win a medal in Pyeongchang.\n\nKennedy wants to make sure that doesn't happen again.\n\n\"I think we should be putting more into our own teams. So maybe I did take it personally,\" he says.\n\nThat's the main reason for Kennedy taking up this position with Curling Canada this season. He says many of the coaches and staff of the sport's national governing body know changes need to be made after the last Olympic performance.\n\n\"Losing forces you to do it, to look in the mirror,\" Kennedy says. \"I think they did. I think there won't be panic but little changes here and there.\"\n\nThey're getting good\n\nYou'll be hard-pressed to find someone more passionate about curling than Kennedy. He's lived and breathed the game for years. And he's won everything there is to win in the sport.\n\nHe won Olympic gold with Kevin Martin's rink in 2010. He's captured two world championships and three Briers. Now he's trying to share his curling knowledge with the next wave of Canadian curling champions.\n\n\"The Olympics was an eye-opener for how good the international teams are getting and have gotten,\" he says. \"We grow up expecting our teams to do well and have also taken a leadership role to help other teams in the world develop.\"\n\nBut Kennedy thinks that leadership role might have gone too far. Now it's time to step up the Canadian game, he says.\n\n\"We're still evolving the game and the game has changed so much. The technical part of it is still the biggest part. Throwing a rock pure and straight will always be the most important thing.\"\n\nWhile Kennedy navigates this new coaching role, he's still trying to find his identity outside of curling. He's spending more time than ever with his two children and his wife.\n\n\"I have a great thing at home. Being away from them was tough for a long time,\" Kennedy says.\n\nAnd then there's that whole fourth-place finish at the Olympics. Kennedy is still working through that. He says he's never felt more prepared for an event in his life, so he doesn't regret a thing despite the disappointing results.\n\n\"Sometimes losing happens for a reason and I wouldn't change any of it,\" he says.\n\nDoes he still think about those games though?\n\n\"There are a few shots I'd love to have back.

That figure increased to 56 per cent after #MeToo launched.\n\nWhen a case is founded but not cleared, it can mean that there was evidence that a crime took place but no perpetrator was identified, said Statistics Canada in its report.\n\nShift away from 'unfounded'\n\n\"Cases that would have been previously classified as unfounded are now being founded, but consequently, proportionally more are going unsolved,\" notes the report.\n\n'Unfounded' is a designation applied to a complaint when police determine through investigation that an offence did not occur.\n\nA 2017 Globe and Mail series found that police in Canada determine sexual assault cases to be baseless at a rate far higher than for other types of crime, raising questions about the conduct of investigations and the distortion of statistics related to sexual assaults.\n\nSince then, police forces across the country, including the RCMP, have vowed to review sexual assault cases deemed unfounded.\n\n\"Changes in police practices explain some of these shifts, given that when more sexual assaults are founded, a lower proportion may be solved as a result,\" said Statistics Canada.\n\nStatistics Canada's report on Canada's sexual assault figures also takes a closer look at those doing the reporting.\n\n\"Overall, victims of sexual assault were disproportionately young women and girls.

Like really, really love it. You're turning it into such a massive megahit that it will soon become both the highest grossing music biopic of all time (surpassing the three-year record held by Straight Outta Compton) and the highest grossing film ever to feature an LGBTQ lead character (destroying the 22-year record of the much more charmingly problematic The Birdcage).\n\nAs a lifetime box office nerd who can't handle when bad movies hold esteemed records (Avatar is still the highest grossing film worldwide ever, people), I'm very annoyed. But as a queer person who fears the effect of inaccurate, unfair and markedly homophobic representations of LGBTQ people making their way this far into the mainstream, I find the whole thing to be very, very fright'ning. And while I understand if you're rolling your eyes thinking the last thing you need right now some angry gaysplaining about a movie that you thought seemed both totally harmless and thoroughly enjoyable, I'd really appreciate if you resist the urge to stop reading \u2014 and consider my concerns.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody. (Fox)\n\nHonestly, I didn't really think it would come to this. When I first saw the film, I left it feeling naively confident that a mix of horrible reviews (outside Rami Malek's perfectly acceptable performance, at least) and discomfort with paying to see a movie that \u2014 for the most part \u2014 is directed by an alleged rapist (Esquire, we're waiting) would render Bohemian Rhapsody a box office disaster. But instead, an army of Queen fans seemed to make the film indestructible, and it grossed more in its first weekend ($51 million) than the combined entire runs of Moonlight and Call Me By Your Name. And audiences appear to be very pleased with what they saw: Bohemian Rhapsody received an \"A\" CinemaScore, and social media erupted with aggressive takedowns of film critics who didn't like it.\n\nI'm not here to add to the pile of complaints about Bohemian Rhapsody's underwhelming filmmaking and cookie-cutter script. Film criticism is subjective anyway, and it's not like most Hollywood studio movies that make a ton of money are actually good. But how many Hollywood studio movies that make a ton of money are this gay? If you define a \"ton\" by $100 million and adjust for 2018 inflation (remember: I'm a box office nerd), the answer is only three: The Birdcage, In & Out and Philadelphia, all of which, notably, were directed by straight men and released in the 1990s. And despite Bohemian Rhapsody coming more than two decades later than any of those films and being partially directed by an openly gay man (even if that man is, unfortunately, Bryan Singer), it handles Freddie Mercury's sexuality and battle with HIV/AIDS so problematically that it makes Philadelphia look like it was directed by Gus Van Sant. And my biggest concern is the effect that will have on people who rarely, if ever, are exposed to this kind of representation.\n\nUnlike many biopics about LGBTQ folks (I'm looking at you, The Imitation Game), that problem isn't \"straight-washing.\" Mercury's sexuality is actually a considerable focus, as is his contracting HIV/AIDS. It's just that so much of what you see in Bohemian Rhapsody is not how things actually occurred in real life. As one example, the film shows Mercury being diagnosed with HIV just before the iconic 1985 Live Aid London show that Rhapsody uses as a finale. He tells the rest of the band immediately; they all hug it out, the diagnosis seemingly acting as a catalyst for them to perform like never before. But in real life, Mercury didn't know his HIV status until two years after Live Aid, and the band wasn't aware until two years after that. The idea that the film manipulates all these facts for cheap narrative gain is certainly infuriating in itself, but there's much more to it than that.\n\nRami Malek as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. (20th Century Fox)\n\nTake another example, which has the script portraying Mercury as having been a gay man, even though pretty much any account confirms he was bisexual (there is some debate about this, though I am firmly in the camp that one particular scene when he comes out to his ex-fianc\u00e9e Mary Austin that confirms the film's stance that he was gay). This erasure is not only a betrayal of Mercury himself but also plays into this very conservative notion that sexuality is a spectrum-less dichotomy of straight and gay. Worse still, as Bohemian Rhapsody forges on in an effort to appeal to as wide an audience as possible, it makes clear which side of that dichotomy it feels is superior.\n\nFrom the moment Mercury comes out as \"gay,\" the film portrays him as deeply self-loathing, with all the straight people around him reinforcing it by saying things like, \"Your life is going to be very difficult,\" and, \"Be careful!\" Meanwhile, the queer people in his life (with one exception I'll get to later) are all pure evil, taking Mercury away from his \"straight family\" and into a wild life of partying and sex (though since this film is rated PG-13 to appeal to the widest audience possible, we don't even really see any of it \u2014 but judging from this actual footage of Mercury's 1985 birthday party, it doesn't look like a bad time to me).\n\nChief among the evil queers (and, really, the only one who has even remote character development) is Paul Prenter, Mercury's manager who lures him away from the band and down a path of leather bars and benders. There's an entire article devoted to the myriad of historical inaccuracies the film conjures up in the name of making Prenter Bohemian Rhapsody's big bad wolf. In turn, this hands millions of people the impression that the deceased real-life person behind him (Prenter passed away from AIDS in 1991, the same year as Mercury) is deserving of this villainous legacy. All the straight people being portrayed, however, come out of the film looking like flawless saints (particularly the rest of the band, some of whom unsurprisingly played a role in the making of the film).\n\nRami Malek as Freddie Mercury and Allen Leech as Paul Prenter in Bohemian Rhapsody. (Fox)\n\nThere's one particular sequence involving Paul Prenter's heavily fictionalized role in Mercury's descent that stands out as one of Bohemian Rhapsody's greatest crimes. Prenter and Mercury are at what appears to be a gay leather bar where every single patron has a vacant, satanic look on their face. As Queen classic \"Another One Bites The Dust\" plays, Prenter takes Mercury into a sex room, and then the film cuts to Mercury looking sickly in bed coughing as the song continues playing. (Get it? He's biting the dust!) With the subtlety of an episode of Riverdale, the film decides to suggest to the world that this is how Mercury contracted HIV, which a) is inaccurate, as it is not known how he did, and b) reinforces the dangerous and tired trope of AIDS being a \"punishment\" for gay promiscuity.\n\nShortly after this sequence, Mercury himself finds out his HIV status (which we've already noted is years off), just as he has finally made his way out of the apparent hellscape of associating with other queer people and back to where he belongs: surrounded exclusively by angelic straight people, who are ready to forgive him for fictionally abandoning them to pursue other aspirations and live life as a queer person. And this is when the film decides it's okay for Freddie to find love.\n\nWe might not actually know if Mercury found pride in his sexuality in real life, but since the film has no issue making everything else up, why not give him a scene where he really comes into his own as the queer icon that he was? - Peter Knegt\n\nIn real life, Freddie Mercury met a hairdresser named Jim Hutton at a London gay nightclub before settling into seven-year relationship with him that ended with Mercury's death. Bohemian Rhapsody decides instead that they met when Hutton was working as a hired hand at one of Mercury's fabulous house parties. At the end of the night, a drunk and lonely Mercury grabs Hutton's ass without consent. Hutton is annoyed by the advance, but he agrees to sit down and have a beer with Mercury. They have a flirtatious chat, but when Mercury suggests they should see each other again, Hutton walks out, telling him to \"come find me when you like yourself.\"\n\n\n\nApparently this exchange was so memorable to Mercury that, years later, he decides to take out the phone book and go knock on the door of every Jim Hutton in London, a quest he undertakes on...the same day as the Live Aid concert! When he finally finds the right Jim, he basically immediately takes him to meet his family, coming out to them through suggesting him and Jim are lovers (they've spent maybe a total of two hours together at this point). And then he takes him to the concert, where his \"straight family\" awaits to wholeheartedly embrace Jim as a new member. Yes, straight people, this is how us gays find love: knock on doors for hours until we find the man we drunkenly sexually harassed at a party five years earlier and basically commit to a lifetime with him on the spot.\n\nJim Hutton and Freddie Mercury in a photo from Hutton's personal collection, published in his memoir \"Mercury and Me.\" (Jim Hutton)\n\nThe narrative with Jim Hutton is mostly just silly, but it does present his relationship with Mercury as only acceptable after Mercury comes back to his heteronormative bubble. It also suggests, given the exchange during their fake first meeting, that returning to this bubble and abandoning his queer life is \"liking himself\" \u2014 except Bohemian Rhapsody never even tries to make an argument that Mercury ever does like himself. It's too busy moralizing his behaviour and making sure his \"straight family\" gets enough screen time. We might not actually know if Mercury found pride in his sexuality in real life, but since the film has no issue making everything else up, why not give him a scene where he really comes into his own as the queer icon that he was?\n\nI saw Bohemian Rhapsody a second time on its opening weekend because I wanted to experience it with a public audience before writing this (don't worry, I'm not a hypocrite: I snuck in after buying a ticket to The Hate U Give, which you do need to see). I wanted to make sure I wasn't totally off with my pretty harsh feelings (I wasn't) and was also just curious of the audience makeup \u2014 which, turns out, was a lot of...families and teenagers. And I couldn't stop thinking about the likelihood that this was the first time a lot of them ever saw a queer character or queer love or HIV/AIDS depicted in a big movie like this.\n\nWhat would it teach them, besides a whole lot of factual errors about Freddie Mercury's life? That if you're queer, you will hate yourself? That if you're promiscuous, you deserve to get AIDS? That you're nothing without your \"straight family\"? If you look close enough, those are the lessons of Bohemian Rhapsody. And as the film makes its way to millions and millions more people over the next few weeks, it's important to understand what the lessons represent: lies perpetrated by greedy straight people (and one clearly self-loathing gay man) who wanted this movie to make a lot of money and don't seem to give an actual shit about Freddie Mercury.", "At least three people were injured outside the Montreal General Hospital this morning after a car ran off the road.\n\nThe three people inside the vehicle were stabilized on site and were brought into the hospital for further evaluation, said Urgences-Sant\u00e9 spokesperson St\u00e9phane Gascon.\n\nThe car appeared to strike a pole outside the hospital.\n\nIt was not immediately known if any pedestrians had been injured in the incident.", "IOC president Thomas Bach gave his blessing Thursday for the joint Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics to move forward without funding from the Italian government.\n\nThe candidacy is being supported exclusively \u2014 financially at least \u2014 by the regional governments of Lombardy and Veneto.\n\n\"This candidature is very strong because it reflects the reforms of Olympic Agenda 2020,\" Bach said at the conclusion of two days of meetings in Rome. \"The guarantees which have been expressed by Lombardy and Veneto are very important to secure the overall candidature.

If the function is removed, it would greatly reduce CONI's power.\n\n\"Clearly finding a solution to this issue has taken precedent over everything else,\" CONI president Giovanni Malago said.\n\nAdded Bach: \"After the talks with CONI and with the undersecretary Giorgetti, I'm very confident there will be a solution found which will be in the interests of Italy and the interests of sport.\"\n\nThe Milan-Cortina bid was originally slated to be a three-pronged candidacy including Turin, which hosted the 2006 Winter Games. But infighting led to Turin being dropped.\n\nUnder the revised plan, hockey and speed skating \u2014 which had been slotted for venues built for the 2006 Turin Games \u2014 would be held in Milan along with the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nAlpine skiing would be held in 1956 host Cortina, while biathlon would be slated for nearby Anterselva \u2014 a regular stop on the biathlon World Cup circuit.\n\nOther snow sports could be held in Bormio, north of Milan, while ski jumping could be held at an existing facility in Predazzo, which would mean involving a third region \u2014 Trentino-Alto Adige.\n\nItaly is anxious to bring a bid through the entire process after two Rome candidacies were withdrawn.\n\nTwo years ago, Italy was forced to end Rome's bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics because of staunch opposition from the city's mayor. And in 2012, then-premier Mario Monti scrapped the city's bid for the 2020 Olympics because of financial concerns.\n\nWhen asked if the IOC had a backup plan if all three of the 2026 bids withdraw, Bach responded: \"The answer is no.\"\n\nAmid reports that Buenos Aires and Ushuaia, Argentina, are interested in formulating a 2026 bid, Bach rejected re-opening the race.\n\n\"We are in the race for 2026 and we will not change the rules in the middle of the race,\" he said. \"On the other hand, we are very happy to see already now there is good interest to host the Winter Games in 2030.

However, research suggests that only 10 per cent of such incidents are reported.\n\nThat number significantly underrepresents the problem, Greene said. At Iris Kirby alone, they see about 450 admissions each year, she said, and take about 20,000 phone calls.\n\n\"There's that many in need. We have to turn people away,\" said Greene, who said their housing is usually at 85 or 95 per cent full.\n\nDomestic violence costs businesses $78 million per year in Canada, according to a 2009 report from the federal Justice Department.\n\nWith files from Carolyn Stokes\n\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "A Victoria naturopath who drew public attention for treating a child with a homeopathic solution made from rabid dog saliva, has surrendered her licence but says she will continue to act as an unregulated homeopath.\n\nThe College of Naturopathic Physicians of B.C. says Anke Zimmermann voluntarily gave up her licence after a \"collegial discussion\" with its inquiry committee earlier this month.\n\nAt the centre of the discussion was the college's policy on immunization \u2014 which forbids naturopaths from including anti-immunization materials in their advertising and from counselling patients against vaccination without a properly documented medical rationale.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do, not help them? \u2014 Anke Zimmermann\n\n\"The registrant indicated that she felt that complying with the college's bylaws and policies, in particular, the immunization standard, made it difficult for her to serve her patients with her integrity,\" the college said in a public notification.\n\n\"The registrant understood the college's standards of practice and that her approach to practice does not align with the college's regulation of the profession in that area.\"\n\nThe college said Zimmermann made it clear in their meeting that she intends to practise as a homeopath.

Large swathes of mature pine in the park are red and dead.\n\nIf decisive action is not taken soon, this sad scene will be replayed in forests throughout Canada.\n\nPan-Canadian approach needed\n\nOn Monday, the Alberta legislature unanimously passed a motion, sponsored by Edmonton-Manning MLA Heather Sweet, urging co-operation with the government of Canada to tackle this problem immediately.\n\nCo-operation is the right approach. For too many years, pine beetle has been seen as a provincial problem.\n\nFirst it was a B.C. problem. Now it's an Alberta problem. With pine beetles already entrenched in areas east of Lac La Biche, it will soon also be a Saskatchewan problem. And with a continuous band of pine throughout Canada's boreal forest, the epidemic will surely spread beyond Saskatchewan all the way to Canada's East Coast.\n\nIt's time to stop taking a one-off approach in each province. That just leads to the problem showing up on the doorstep of the next neighbour to the east.\n\nA valiant effort\n\nOver the past decade, Alberta has invested over $500 million to help stop the beetle. The government of Saskatchewan has recognized that it is the next province in line and has wisely provided support to Alberta.\n\nMountain pine beetles have caused extensive damage in Alberta forests. (Ward Strong/B.C. Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations)\n\nThis funding has served both provinces very well. Although the beetle has caused extensive damage to forests in the Grande Prairie and Hinton/Jasper regions, the devastation is nowhere near what we have seen in British Columbia. In that province, there have been extensive mill closures that have proven catastrophic for forest communities throughout the interior.\n\nAlberta's valiant effort to stop the beetle has served the people of Canada well, too. We've held back the surge for 10 years, giving communities in the beetle's path time to adjust. It's given provinces east of Alberta time to put in place plans to protect watersheds and update firefighting procedures.\n\nIf we are going to continue to perform this public service, we need some help.\n\nA national problem\n\nThe government of Alberta has recently requested $95 million in pine beetle assistance from the government of Canada. This money would be spent over the next five years and matched with contributions from Alberta.\n\nIt's in the national interest for this request to be honoured. After all, this is a national problem.\n\nAnd it's not just an industry problem, or a problem for Canadians living in rural forestry towns. It's a problem for everyone.\n\nAerial photograph shows a forest infested by the mountain pine beetle. (Government of Alberta)\n\nPine beetle has the potential to wreak havoc on drinking water supplies for millions of Canadians. Properly managed forests are critical filtration systems for water. And I've been told by water management professionals that one of their worst nightmares is large quantities of sediment and ash in a municipal drinking water supply. It is very difficult and expensive to remove.\n\nThus, a pest that kills trees and heightens fire risk is a real threat to cities like Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg whose drinking water originates in pine forests.\n\nAnd then there's our air quality. Pine beetle can be a significant factor in forest fires. Fires in B.C. during the summers of 2017 and 2018 caused air quality alerts and emergency room visits in Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, and many other cities.\n\nResidents in remote Indigenous communities in northern B.C. were even less fortunate. They had to be evacuated. There is a real health and safety imperative at play here.\n\nNot going away\n\nOur beetle problem is not going away any time soon. Pine beetles are a bit like a marching army. Once they are allowed to build a critical mass, they use it to spread even further. This is precisely the situation in Jasper National Park, where the beetle population has exploded.\n\nIt's only a matter of time before the beetles use this beachhead to expand. And once a population begins expanding, they present a threat to forests for hundreds of kilometres downwind. In fact, beetles from the invasion of Jasper have been found in Edmonton's urban forests.\n\nThe key\n\nThe key to the beetle problem involves taking decisive action as soon as populations begin to materialize. Populations need to be tracked aggressively, older pine stands in the beetle's path need to be thinned before they become infested, and single infested trees must be felled and burned.\n\nThis has been the Alberta approach for more than decade and it has worked. The problem is that it's expensive and it's no longer reasonable for Alberta to shoulder all of the burden.\n\nNot without precedent\n\nThere is precedent for federal assistance with these types of problems. The government of Canada did provide a small assistance package for Alberta when the beetle first arrived, but that commitment ended more than 10 years ago.\n\nMore recently, $74 million was provided to Atlantic provinces to deal with a spruce budworm outbreak. Given the potential consequences of a nation-wide pine beetle outbreak, we need federal funding here in Alberta, too.\n\nIt's time for the government of Canada to step up to the plate so that this important work can continue.", "A parent whose children are no longer eligible to be bused to school says the school district's rule is both a safety risk and a hit to her income.\n\nErika Walsh lives in Kelligrews, and last year her three children were on the list for busing to their school, Admiral's Academy in Conception Bay South. This year, however, she learned on the first day of school \u2014 via a phone call from her sixth grader \u2014 that things had changed.\n\n\"I didn't get a letter in the mail. I didn't get an email,\" said Walsh, who runs an after-school babysitting business in her home.\n\n\"I got no forewarning that my three kids now are not going to have transportation to and from school, and also the kids that I take care of aren't going to be able to get on the bus.\"\n\nWalsh's children are now expected to walk the nearly 1.6 kilometres to school, something she said is unacceptable to her because it would require them to first walk along their street, which is curvy and has no sidewalks, and then along the C.B.S. highway.\n\n\"I'm not comfortable with that as a parent. It's just not safe. And especially with our weather,\" she told The St. John's Morning Show.\n\nThe 1.6-kilometre rule\n\nAt issue is the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District's 1.6-kilometre rule for school busing. According to information on the district's website, busing is provided for students at no additional charge if they live 1.6 kilometres or more from their zoned neighbourhood school \u2014 a distance defined as the shortest route along a publicly maintained roadway, the district said in a statement.\n\nI didn't get a letter in the mail. I didn't get an email. - Erika Walsh\n\nWalsh believes she is outside of that 1.6-kilometre limit, and cites the fact that her children were on the list for busing last year, as well as the two previous years at their former school, St. Edwards. When her family purchased their home, she said, it was a top priority to ensure it was on the school bus route.\n\nHowever, the district has told her she is 0.02 kilometres \u2014 20 metres \u2014 too close to the school to qualify for busing. Walsh disputes that distance by her own measurements but also said safety concerns should sometimes trump the distance consideration.\n\nThis week the rule has been the subject of debate in the House of Assembly, where MHA Barry Petten brought forward a private member's resolution for debate Wednesday that asked the government to remove the 1.6-kilometre rule in cases where safety is a concern.\n\nThe Liberals attempted to amend that resolution to ask the government to consider removing the 1.6-kilometre limit upon further investigation of the effectiveness of the courtesy stop policy. That amendment passed, though the Progressive Conservatives opposed it.\n\nOn Thursday, MHA David Brazil again brought up the rule, calling it outdated and unsafe. Education Minister Al Hawkins said he was discussing the rule with the NLESD.\n\nOther parents share Walsh's frustration. A Facebook group, Against 1.6 Km, was started last year by Kelly Dixon, who has her own issues with the regulations.\n\nChildren within the 1.6-kilometre limit for busing can sometimes get a spot on a bus, if it goes by their house, but there is limited availability. (CBC)\n\n\"Parents are coming out right, left and centre. Everybody's frustrated how this is affecting their lives,\" Walsh said.\n\n\"It's affecting so many people in so many ways, not only inconvenience but really making people stress out even more and losing their income.\"\n\n'Getting to school should not be a stress'\n\nPetten has been supportive, Walsh said, and his office gave her the petitions when she visited.\n\n\"He's all on board,\" she said. \"He's been fighting this for years.\"\n\nPetten introduced a private member's motion in the House of Assembly but a message he sent to Walsh said two amendments introduced by the Liberals changed its intended outcome, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Walsh said she's heard that some communities are helping parents with the costs of transportation when they do not qualify for busing under the school board's policy.\n\n\"At least maybe we can all be doing that, if the 1.6 can't be changed,\" she said.\n\nWalsh hopes people will get involved because the safety of children, she said, is at stake, especially during the upcoming winter.\n\n\"There's people that this doesn't affect, but I still think it's such a simple thing to support even if you don't have small kids,\" she said.\n\n\"Getting to school should not be a stress on parents.

They have requested a meeting with the chief.\n\n\"I'm hoping to see he reaches out to the many communities that make up our city, including the African-Canadian community that has been, from their perspective, victimized by a strong police presence and felt intimidated and fearful of a force that's supposed to protect them,\" said Cherrington.\n\nAdvice from Indigenous elder\n\nMcFee, who is returning to the hockey town where he was born, shares a strong passion for the game.

(Queen\u2019s University Archives/Chesterfield collection)\n\nThe Great War began Aug. 4, 1914. It ended on Nov. 11, 1918. But Canada's first national internment operations would continue until June 1920.\n\nThousands of immigrants, lured to the Dominion with promises of freedom and free land, were suddenly branded as \"enemy aliens.\" What little wealth they had was confiscated. They were forced to do heavy labour for the profit of their jailers \u2014 not because they had done anything wrong, but only because of who they were, where they had come from.\n\nInternees at Fort Henry including Nick Sakaliuk, seated cross-legged on the floor at left. (Submitted by Lubomyr Luciuk)\n\nProvidence united me with a man named Nick Sakaliuk on Valentine's Day, 1978. Doing MA research at Queen's University, I was looking for Ukrainians who lived in Kingston during the First World War.\n\nWhen I found Nick I asked standard questions about his immigrant experience, including where he had worked. I assumed in the shipyards, grain elevators, locomotive works or at the Davis Tannery. \"No,\" he replied, \"I was in Fort Henry, a prisoner.\"\n\nI was dumbfounded. I had never heard of prisoners in the fort.\n\nNick told me how, in 1912, he left Bukovyna, a western Ukrainian region then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. When war broke out he was working in Montreal at the Canadian Car and Foundry Company. A \"patriotic\" boss fired him immediately.\n\nSearching for work, he tried to board a train for the United States, then still a neutral power. Arrested instead, Nick was transported to Fort Henry, arriving Oct. 17, 1914. From there he would later be moved to the Petawawa and Kapuskasing internment camps, then paroled, ironically, to work in a munitions factory.\n\nIt was this plain-hearted man who first told me the truth about what he and other Ukrainians had endured.\n\nWomen and children at Spirit Lake internment camp in the Abitibi region of Quebec. (National Library & Archives)\n\nIn 1988 I met another survivor, Mary Manko Haskett, who told me her own children disbelieved her story. Montreal-born and therefore a British subject at birth, Mary was six years old when her entire family was relocated to the Spirit Lake camp in Quebec's remote Abitibi. Her two-and-a-half-year-old sister Nellie perished there. Yet when Mary's children asked her to show them where Spirit Lake was on a map, she couldn't. It had been erased from Quebec's place name geography.\n\nBut Mary wasn't bitter. Instead she ennobled our redress campaign by insisting it must be \"about memory, not money.\" Mary wanted no compensation, no official apology. All she hoped for was that her fellow Canadians would remember what had been disremembered.\n\nLubomyr Luciuk, left, and other members of the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association travelled to Parliament Hill seeking redress for internment during the First World War. (Fernando Monte)\n\nIn the years following this discovery, I and other members of the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association orchestrated a redress campaign, travelling to Parliament Hill to make our case. What I heard from Ottawa's men and women, was an insistence that internment operations had \"never happened.\" When denial didn't work they instructed us to forget and just \"move on.\" Oddly, they never offered others raising historical injustices a similar prescription, then or since. Why, I cannot imagine.\n\nWe did not falter. In 2005, thanks to MP Inky Mark, a Chinese-Canadian whose family once paid the head tax, we secured passage of Bill C 331, the Internment of Persons of Ukrainian Origin Recognition Act. It led to the creation in 2008 of the Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund, mandated to hallow the memory of all of the \"enemy aliens\" through commemorative and educational initiatives.\n\nLubomyr Luciuk was part of a push for redress for Ukrainian-Canadians, which resulted in numerous plaques and historical markers being placed at internment sites such as Fort Henry. (Angela Faulkner)\n\nToday, when I climb Fort Henry hill \u2014 alas, no longer a boy dashing about \u2014 I pause to reflect on how two men, one of Chinese heritage, the other of Ukrainian, worked together and saw justice done.\n\nDoing so reminds me of just how good a country we live in, despite such historical wrongs.

(CBC)\n\nHere's a summary of how it works and what would change for voters.\n\nIn one sentence\n\nRural-urban proportional would see the majority of British Columbians choose their MLAs using the single transferable vote (STV) system, while those in rural areas would select MLAs using the mixed member proportional system.\n\nThe majority of British Columbians would choose their MLAs using the single transferable vote (STV) system, while those in rural areas wold select MLAs using the mixed member proportional system. (CBC)\n\nWhat would the ballot look like?\n\nIn rural areas, people would have a list of candidates in their riding and choose one, same as currently.\n\nIn urban areas, people would choose between a larger list of candidates comprising their entire region. Anywhere from two to seven MLAs will be elected in these regions, so voters will see multiple candidates from each party on the ballot. They would then rank as many candidates as they would like, from as many parties as they would like.\n\nIn urban areas, people would choose between a larger list of candidates comprising their entire region. They would then rank as many candidates as they would like, from as many parties as they would like. (CBC)\n\n\"The big problem with the current system, and it's not solved by some of the other systems, is that people don't have the chance to really express themselves in their vote,\" said Bruce Hallsor, co-chair of the Yes side in the 2005 and 2009 STV referendums.\n\n\"They have to think about who's ahead in the polls, who they want to stop, who do they think might have a chance of winning in the riding. Under STV, you just get to vote for who you want to vote for.\"\n\nHow would MLAs be determined?\n\nIn rural areas, the candidate with the most votes in each riding is elected, keeping the current first-past-the-post system (although the ridings will be larger). A small group of secondary rural MLAs would then be picked, so that the number of rural MLAs each party received would be equivalent to the overall percentage of the vote.\n\nIn rural areas, the candidate with the most votes in each riding is elected, keeping the current first-past-the-post system (although the ridings will be larger). A small group of secondary rural MLAs would then be picked, so that the number of rural MLAs each party received would be equivalent to the overall percentage of the vote. (CBC)\n\nIn urban areas, candidates would have to receive a certain quota of first place votes to be automatically elected.\n\nOnce they reach that number, the excess votes are transferred to whomever is the second choice on a voter's ballot (or whoever the highest choice is on that ballot who hasn't met the quota yet). If no candidates reach the quota on the first ballot, the candidate with the least number of first-place votes is eliminated, and people's second choices on those ballots are counted instead.\n\nThis process would continue until the total number elected matches the number allowed in that urban region.\n\nWhat are the advantages of this system?\n\n\"STV is simple to use. You just go and vote your preference,\" said Hallsor, who noted that most parties in Canada now use preferential ballots to choose their leaders, including the B.C. Liberals and B.C. NDP.\n\n\"What it really is designed to do is make sure voters have a lot more choice available than they do in the current single member ridings. By giving people a chance to vote 1-2-3, it allows them to vote for a candidate who maybe doesn't have a chance of winning, and having their second or third choice count, if their first choice is knocked off the ballot.\"\n\nWhat could be the disadvantages?\n\nThe precise way MLAs are chosen in STV is not directly proportional and involves mathematical theories which can be difficult for the average voters to grasp.\n\nVoters in urban areas would have multiple MLAs for their general region, instead of one directly for their specific area. Also, like the other two PR systems under consideration, B.C. would likely have minority governments most of the time, which critics argue would lead to private deals made between parties to determine who holds power and could lead to extremist parties having an outsized influence.\n\nWould the size of my riding change?\n\nThe size of rural ridings would generally increase by 50 to 100 per cent to allow for the MMP MLAs to be chosen.\n\nThe size of urban ridings would increase by 100 to 600 per cent, because each urban riding would have between two and seven MLAs.\n\nCould smaller parties and independents get elected?\n\nIn the areas classified as rural, smaller parties would need at least five per cent of the vote to qualify for seats but would likely need closer to 10 per cent of the overall vote to actually receive one.\n\nIn urban areas, an independent or candidate from a smaller party could win one of the seats, if they are broadly popular enough to gain 2nd, 3rd or 4th place votes on enough people's ballots.\n\nWhat would be determined after the referendum?\n\nLike the other two systems on the ballot, an all-party legislative committee would decide the total number of MLAs, with a maximum of 95 in total.\n\nAn independent electoral boundaries commission would then have to create the province's new electoral map. It would also have to decide which areas of the province will use MMP and which areas will use STV.\n\nIn rural areas using MMP, the all-party committee would have to decide whether people will vote once (for individual candidates) or twice (once for individual candidates, and once for specific parties to decide the second layer of MLAs).\n\nCBC Vancouver will have special coverage of the debate between B.C.

In fact, he added, the faculty is hoping to boost numbers for the program, which has always been small but has had declining numbers in recent years.\n\n\"That's still there and we would encourage people to sign up for the program, get in, and help us with our numbers, certainly,\" he said.\n\nLooking to increase enrolment\n\nThe number of people in the bachelor of education with a music specialization program has been as high as 21, Anderson said, but had about 10 or 11 students last year.\n\nOnly a single person is enrolled in the conjoint option, he said, and they will be able to finish despite its overall suspension.\n\nMusic education is not a program that will ever be large, he said; 25 would be an optimal number, and the faculty is looking at how it could get its numbers to that level.\n\nIan Sutherland is the dean of the School of Music at Memorial University.

(Submitted by Steven Lett)\n\n\"There's no way to tell where it's coming from, no way to tell the identity of the source,\" said Steve Lett, head of the Cospas-Sarsat Secretariat, the international organization that runs the satellite-based search and rescue system.\n\n\"It relies on the luck of having another aircraft possibly flying nearby and that aircraft having its receiver tuned to 121.5 MHz, and also that aircraft not assuming that it's some sort of a test.\"\n\nSearch and rescue satellites no longer pick up the 121.5 MHz distress signal, which isn't a problem for large commercial airplanes most Canadians use to travel because they use up-to-date ELTs.\n\nThose systems are designed to go off when a plane crashes, sending a signal to orbiting satellites that is relayed to a mission control centre. Local search and rescue crews are then advised where they can find the crash site.\n\n\"Private aircraft, general aviation aircraft, they are not as closely supervised. They tend to crash much more frequently and yet governments ... the Canadian and U.S. governments included, continue to allow them to fly with only a 121.5 MHz ELT,\" said Lett, whose organization stopped monitoring the 121.5 MHz frequency in 2009.\n\nSearch and rescue technicians rely on ELTs to find aircraft that have crashed. (JTFA/Twitter)\n\nThe older distress signals weren't accurate, so Cospas-Sarsat began monitoring ELTs that emit a 406 MHz radio signal instead. Those signals are digital and capable of providing more accurate location information and even the identity of the aircraft.\n\nBut in Canada, it is not mandatory for planes to have a 406 MHz ELT.\n\nThe Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined in 2016 there were approximately 27,000 aircraft registered in Canada that required an ELT, but only 10,086 equipped with a 406 MHz ELT.\n\nLarger commercial planes already have 406 MHz ELTs installed. (Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)\n\nThat year, the board recommended that Transport Canada make 406 MHz ELTs mandatory.\n\nTransport Canada accepted the recommendations, but so far, no regulations have changed, said Daryl Collins, a senior investigator with the board.\n\nTransport Canada declined to be interviewed, but said it continually explores ways of updating safety requirements.\n\nThis diagram outlines how what happens after an emergency signal is transmitted. (Cospas-Sarsat)\n\nSince the new ELTs aren't mandatory, pilots are less willing to adopt them and many don't trust the transmitters will work in an emergency, said Bernard Gervais, president and CEO of the Canadian Owners and Pilots Association.\n\nThe association has 16,000 members across the country who fly everything from recreational and personal aircraft to private and business planes.\n\nBernard Gervais of the Canadian Owners and Pilots Association says pilots don't care about the cost of installing a new ELT, which can run between $650 and $750, plus installation. It's the reliability of the devices that most pilots question, he says. (Jean-Pierre/flickr.com/djipibi)\n\nGervais said ELTs, new or old, have a spotty track record of activating when they're supposed to.\n\n\"Right now it's just an iffy thing. Like I'd be down there, stuck in the airplane with broken legs, and I would think I've got a 60 per cent chance that this thing went off and that would be it.

(Submitted by Bernard Gervais)\n\nA number of things can cause an ELT to fail. A broken antenna, a fire, being submerged in water, and even mountains or thick forests can interfere with its radio signal.\n\nAlso, if a plane strikes the ground so hard that it breaks up into pieces, it's unlikely the ELT would be intact enough to produce a signal.\n\nThe TSB said its research shows ELT signals aren't picked up in 30 to 40 per cent of crashes, often because the equipment was damaged in some way. That's why the board also recommended to Transport Canada that work be done to change the design of ELTs to improve their functionality after a crash.\n\nIn Canada last year, there were 58 reported activations of 406 MHz ELTs during accidents. In 17 of those, the ELT was the only way search and rescue crews knew that an aircraft had gone down.\n\nLt.-Col. Jonathan Nelles, senior staff officer with search and rescue at 1 Canadian Air Division with the Armed Forces, said their analysis shows ELTs are 85 to 90 per cent effective in alerting search and rescue workers to an aircraft in distress.\n\nThe antenna of this ELT broke when an air ambulance flight crashed in Ontario in May 2013. The broken antenna was enough to prevent its signal from reaching search and rescue crews. (Transportation Safety Board ) In this section of the air ambulance that crashed in 2013, only the base of the ELT's antenna remains. The rest of the ELT was working, but it couldn't transmit its message because of the damage. (Transportation Safety Board)\n\nWithout an ELT, rescue crews searching for the wreckage of an aircraft have a hard road ahead of them.\n\n\"Not having a good idea of a precise location makes it challenging because some aircraft itineraries and routes are over hundreds of miles, and that results in a long, laborious search across all sorts of terrain and in all sorts of conditions,\" he said.\n\nLett admits the 406 MHz ELT isn't perfect technology, but said that shouldn't keep a pilot from upgrading a plane's antiquated distress system.\n\n\"From a common sense standpoint, it seems that if someone cares about their life and the life of their loved one, they'd want to make sure they had this relatively inexpensive insurance policy in case something went wrong with their plane.\"", "While a dozen Cannabis NB stores in the province are closed because of low stock, other outlets have started to pick up the slack \u2014 illegally.\n\nKing Canna has reopened after being shuttered because of a warning from Fredericton police this summer.\n\nNo one from the dispensary, which operates illegally, agreed to speak with CBC News.\n\nJessica Duivenvoorden visited the dispensary to purchase cannabis Tuesday but said she didn't know it was illegal.\n\nShe said she has shopped at Cannabis NB before but was underwhelmed by the experience.\n\n\"When I went in, they didn't have a very big supply, because I know the shortage came very quickly,\" said Duivenvoorden.\n\n\"They didn't have any pre-rolled, which was hard for me because I'm not a user all the time, so [it's] something I've never really gotten a knack for.\"\n\nQuality control issues?\n\nMarcus Urquhart alleges he's been short-changed while shopping at Cannabis NB.

Inspectors had discovered four different maintenance schedules for the planes. The airline was given nine days to come up with a plan to solve the problem.\n\nAir Transat also confirmed to inspectors that 41 out of 42 contracted employees performing maintenance work in Montreal and Toronto did not meet its own training program requirements.\n\nNo one should be afraid of getting on an airplane ever and going anywhere in the world - Elaine Parker, vice-president of Beyond Risk Management, a Calgary-based aviation safety consultancy\n\nA flight attendant manager told Transport Canada she relied on social media \u2014 in addition to a Transport Canada training guide, an aviation conference and brainstorming sessions with a colleague \u2014 to figure out appropriate training.\n\nThe deadline to fix the different training shortcomings was two weeks.\n\nInspectors also discovered a service difficulty report was never submitted after corroded hinge pins were identified on a plane's rudder. These reports, which are required of all airlines, are to be submitted to Transport Canada, which keeps track of conditions that can adversely affect the airworthiness of planes.

And as it moves toward that target, its best practices will be shared by its Chinese parent.\n\nSo long as North American-made electric vehicle prices stay high, the six per cent tariff on imported electric cars from China will be manageable, if they can keep their costs down.\n\nExpanding Chinese footprint\n\nTed Dowling, BYD's vice-president for Canada, says he can't talk about when his company's cars will be available to the public in this country.\n\nBut BYD is expanding its footprint here. The company already has contracts to sell its all-electric buses in several places in Canada, including to the Toronto Transit Commission and to a Vancouver-based sightseeing operation.\n\nThe TTC deal is still on despite the change in government at Queen's Park, Dowling says. And plans for a Canadian assembly facility are underway, he says, but he can't say where yet.\n\nAs for the BYD vehicles heading to Montreal, Dowling calls it \"the best-selling electric taxi in the world.\"\n\nThe vehicle's battery pack should last a full day of Montreal driving, he says, and while the purchase price is high, as with other vehicles made for use as taxis, maintenance costs will be much lower.\n\nPlus, Dowling notes, the payback rate for heavily used electric vehicles \u2014 including taxis, buses and trucks \u2014 is much faster than for consumer cars simply because they are on the road for so many hours a day.\n\nAnd his thoughts on the quality of Chinese-built cars? He says he's driven them, they're good and he can't wait until they reach the Canadian consumer market.\n\n\"If you look at the new cars that BYD is building now, they're just as good as anything else that's on the road today,\" said Dowling. \"I want to drive one here.\"\n\nBut, of course, that's what you'd expect him to say.\n\nFollow Don Pittis on Twitter: @don_pittis", "The resignation of U.S. attorney general Jeff Sessions could significantly curtail \u2014 or perhaps even end \u2014 the Russia investigation, experts say, as it will now be overseen by a replacement who has publicly expressed his skepticism about the probe.\n\n\"[This] will effectively bring the investigation to a halt,\" said William Yeomans, who served 26 years at the U.S. Department of Justice and was a former chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"And there really isn't legal way to stop [that].\"\n\nSessions's former chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker, will be taking over as acting attorney general, with a permanent replacement expected to be nominated at a later date.\n\nThe imminent departure was expected, as Sessions has been repeatedly criticized by Donald Trump for recusing himself from any investigation into potential Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTrump blamed that decision for opening the door to the appointment of Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who ultimately took on the Russia investigation, and has since been examining, among other things, whether Trump's hectoring of Sessions was part of a broader effort to obstruct justice.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to his broad mandate about a year and a half ago, has overseen the probe's work ever since.\n\n'In charge of all matters'\n\nWhen asked whether Whitaker would now assume control over the Mueller investigation, U.S. Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Flores said Whitaker would be \"in charge of all matters\" under the purview of the department.\n\n\"It seems as if the supervision of that investigation now rests with Whitaker,\" said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor with the Southern District of New York.\n\nBut questions remain around whether Rosenstein will agree to that, he said, noting there could be some kind of dispute over who has the authority to oversee the probe.\n\n\"It does seem as if the intention is that Whitaker will now oversee it \u2014 and that he, unlike Sessions, will not recuse himself,\" Sandick said. \"And therefore whatever else Rosenstein may do as the deputy attorney general, it won't include this investigation.\"\n\nJeff Sessions imminent departure as attorney general was expected, as he had been repeatedly criticized by Trump since recusing himself from any investigation into Russia's alleged election meddling. In a one-page letter announcing his resignation, Sessions noted it came at the president's 'request.' (Pablo Monsivais/Associated Press)\n\nIronically, Whitaker once opined about a situation in which Trump could fire Sessions and then appoint an acting attorney general who could stifle the funding of Mueller's probe in an op-ed for CNN.\n\n\"Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing,\" Whitaker wrote.\n\nAccording to Sandick, Whitaker's comments questioning the scope of the Mueller investigation \"seemed to have played a central role in his selection\" as acting attorney general.\n\n\"And it's hard to believe that his appointment isn't meant to impact the direction and existence, perhaps, of that investigation,\" he said.\n\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and expert on federal judicial selection, said a good case can be made that Whitaker has a conflict of interest in the Russia probe, that he has already prejudged the matter and that he has no authority to end it because he's only in the position of acting attorney general.\n\n\"I just don't see how that responsibility falls to him,\" he said. \"[The Justice Department] may take that position, and maybe it's a valid position, but it doesn't sound like it is to me from what I understand of \u2026 how this particular investigation has been carried out and authorized.\"\n\nFreeze on charging decisions\n\nThe special counsel is required to inform the attorney general of any major steps in the investigation, but the attorney general has the authority to scuttle those steps.\n\nThat could include a gradual process of slowing things down, said Yeomans, by not allowing Mueller to interview a particular witness, issue a subpoena, put somebody before a grand jury, or even seek a grand jury indictment.\n\n\"Whitaker obviously has the authority to make it virtually impossible for Mueller to carry on his investigation,\" he said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly lamented that he would have never selected Jeff Sessions for attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself from the Russia probe. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)\n\nWhitaker could also order a freeze on any charging decisions until he has a chance to consider what he thinks the scope of the investigation should be, Sandick said. He could insist that he be given notice and an opportunity to approve or reject any charging decisions.\n\n\"Do we have reason to think that his judgment would be different from the judgment shown by Rosenstein? Sure it's possible,\" he said.\n\nSessions's resignation sparked an outcry from Democrats, who demanded Wednesday that Trump guarantee the Mueller probe would be protected. Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said he wants \"answers immediately,\" raising speculation that the committee could launch an investigation into Trump's actions.", "Just a few weeks ago, there was talk about oil hitting $100 US a barrel after crude prices hit a four-year high in October.\n\nThat's a feat that hasn't been achieved since 2014 before the commodity market came crashing down.\n\nBut since then, oil prices have tumbled around the world \u2014 briefly falling into bear market territory this week.\n\nThat means benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil in New York plunged more than 20 per cent at one point on Tuesday from last month's peak of $76.90. On Wednesday, oil was trading around $61 US per barrel after prices fell for eight straight days.\n\nThe price of oil has lost about 20 per cent of its value since the start of October. (Scott Galley/CBC)\n\nReports Wednesday about plans from the influential Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to discuss cutting oil production next year in response to increasing global inventories also did little to boost prices.\n\nEven with the month long decline, however, some analysts aren't ready to write-off the significant recovery that's been taking place in the oil market this year.\n\n\"I think the market is kind of getting ahead of itself now,\" said Michael Loewen, commodity strategist at Scotiabank. \"The narrative of an emerging recession and bear market played out. We saw what happened with the equity markets, and even in the rates [bonds] markets.\"\n\n\"Both of those markets are starting to recover. Obviously, you're going to take your risky assets [like crude oil] with you.\" Crude oil futures, like many commodities, are generally considered riskier assets for investors compared to bonds due to price volatility.\n\nStock markets have been climbing higher since \"Red October,\" when investors suffered some of the biggest losses this year amid wild swings in equities.\n\nMarket 'spooked'\n\nBut, oil prices haven't followed suit because the prospect of U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports led other big producers like Saudi Arabia, Russia and the U.S. to boost production in order to make up for any shortfall in global supply.\n\n\"There's this misconception here that the market is completely swamped with excess supply ... We think that's a bit of a fallacy,\" said Michael Tran, managing director of RBC's Global Energy Strategy.\n\n\"Many people in this market are quite spooked by the idea that supply is coming in a large size, and demand growth is potentially slowing.\"\n\nData from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in the U.S on Wednesday showed that crude stockpiles grew more than forecast by 5.78 million barrels from the week before.\n\nBut, Tran said there is a disconnect between the physical and financial side of the oil market right now and that's bringing down the price.\n\n\"I think there's a major difference between a market that is well-supplied, and one that is over-supplied, and right now we're in the well-supplied camp,\" he said. \"In the physical market, barrels are selling with relative ease.\"\n\nTran added that on a seasonal basis, generally in October and November, is when oil refiners shut down for planned maintenance.\n\n\"Right now what you're seeing is a pretty heavy maintenance season playing out. So, there's less buying happening in the market,\" Tran said. \"That's a seasonal factor, and we do ultimately think that demand will pick up through the balance of this year to the next several quarters.\"\n\nPrice rebound coming?\n\nTran expects to see oil prices back into the low $70 a barrel range by the end of this year. That's a more than eight per cent jump from the current price. He's calling for it to go even higher next year into the mid $70 range.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the hurdles in the oil market will clear so soon.\n\nKarl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments, said a combination of factors such as tightening global financial conditions like higher interest rates, deleveraging in China, which is reducing the country's appetite for energy exports, and fears over trade tensions could weigh on the market a bit longer.\n\n\"Overall, although oil demand growth is likely to weaken in the longer term, my feeling is that oil prices could rebound into the end of the year,\" Schamotta said.\n\nWhat this means for Canada\n\nIn terms of how global oil prices will impact the Canadian energy market, analysts said the huge discount between Canada's benchmark crude oil \u2014 Western Canadian Select (WCS) \u2014 and WTI could start to narrow next year.\n\nCurrently, WCS is trading around $18 a barrel, while WTI is at $61. A supply glut caused by a lack infrastructure such as pipelines and rail capacity to transport crude exports to key markets like the U.S. has plagued the sector.\n\n\"I believe that rail is going to clear the market in by spring time ... That's when the market starts to get better,\" said Loewen. \"Then you have Enbridge Line 3 coming online in November 2019 ... It adds 350,000 barrels per day and that has massive implications for WCS.\"\n\nSchamotta added that after the widest oil refinery shutdowns in the U.S. Midwest in at least a decade, a number of major refiners are due to restart production in the next couple of months.\n\n\"Canadian producers should begin to earn more revenue from each barrel shipped,\" he said.\n\nBut, Loewen warned that an increase in exports does not mean the Canadian market is \"out of the woods.\"\n\n\"We still need another pipeline. We need a Trans Mountain expansion project or a Keystone XL to really see the fruits,\" Loewen said.", "It is difficult, if not impossible, to unring the bell of populism once it has taken hold.\n\nThis week's U.S. midterm election results, in which Democrats regained control of the House but were dealt a stiff setback in the Senate, proved less a blue wave than a light misting; hardly the wholesale repudiation of President Donald Trump that some had hoped for. Despite a respectable House win, it appears voters were not clamouring for a return to \"business as usual\" governance.\n\nThis election result comes not long after another populist swept to power in the form of Brazil's new right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 an outcome that some characterized as \"unthinkable.\" But for those whose heads are not firmly embedded in the sand (or elsewhere) Bolsonaro's election should not have come as a surprise.\n\nPopulist sentiment has been gaining steam worldwide for years \u2014 most notably in the election of Trump in 2016 \u2014 and it shows no sign of abating. While many of our learned political betters wave away such developments as about little more than bigotry, much of the responsibility for the rise of leaders such as Trump or Bolsonaro rests on the shoulders of out-of-touch political elites, whose chummy insider politics voters increasingly reject.\n\nThe last several years has been a boon to fringe and anti-establishment candidates who have upended the political balance on a wave of populist rhetoric and protest votes. (Getty Images)\n\nWhile perhaps its most notable success, the thumping of both the Democratic and Republican establishments by Trump on his way to the presidency in 2016 was not the beginning or end of populist politics. Former TV comedian Jimmy Morales won the presidency in Guatemala. Anti-establishment Virginia Raggi of Italy's Five Star Party won Rome's mayoral election. And then there was Brexit.\n\nThe last several years has been a boon to fringe and anti-establishment candidates who have upended the political balance on a wave of populist rhetoric and protest votes.\n\nThis is not simply limited to the right either. Once-longshot outsider Jeremy Corbyn assumed leadership of the Labour Party in the U.K. In Canada, the NDP trounced the Progressive Conservatives in Alberta in 2015; a direct result of the latter growing rotten after decades of uninterrupted power in the province.\n\nThis happens for good reason. The perception among many is that public office has simply become the vehicle by which politicians line their pockets and those of their well-connected allies. Perhaps this has always been the case in politics, but it seems not with quite the same reckless hubris politicians have displayed in recent years.\n\nCanada's political class is no slouch in this regard, either. Former governor general Adrienne Clarkson reportedly still bills the Canadian taxpayer six-figures each year; a courtesy not even extended to former prime ministers. And we just learned this month that bureaucrats spent $23 million on 631 new cars for the G7 \u2014 some of which had as few as 41km on them \u2014 and resold them for pennies on the dollar. Just another day in the lives of Very Important People conducting Very Important Business.\n\nMessages that resonate\n\nEstablishment politicians are, of course, loath to engage in any serious introspection in this regard \u2014 to do so would be to challenge their own privileged position in society. Thus, when a politician of national stature comes along and speaks of draining \"swamps\" and the corruption endemic in both parties, it resonates with voters. Trump's victory in 2016, for example, was just as much a rejection of \"establishment\" Republicans as it was of Hillary Clinton.\n\nWith unprecedented flows of information now available to voters, the business-as-usual approach to governance has been turned on its head, and the feckless back-scratching of establishment lifers is on full display for even casual consumers of the news. The more ambitious and wily of politicians are now prepared to exploit this; there's Maxime Bernier, for instance, openly announcing his intentions to lead the sacred cow of supply management to the slaughterhouse.\n\nExisting governments might believe they are immune to the impulses of outside-the-mainstream candidates, but then, the Republican and Democratic establishments said the same thing about the United States right up until they woke up to a President Donald Trump on November 9, 2016. Populists movements feed on political entitlement and waste. And as we've seen in Europe, the U.S. and South America, once they get started, they are exceedingly hard to stop.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

(Martin Trainor/CBC News)\n\nSecondary suites allowed since 2000\n\nIn Toronto, secondary suites like basement apartments have been allowed city-wide since 2000, and city planners say the current zoning reflects that landscape nearly two decades ago.\n\nRules barring the creation of extra rental suites in new homes came from a desire to protect neighbourhood character, and to ensure new-build duplexes didn't become the norm, said Klaus Lehmann, a manager with city planning who's in charge of zoning and the committee of adjustment.\n\nA 2018 report to the outgoing council from chief city planner Gregg Lintern recommends removing the time requirement that's preventing Kanitz from renting out her suite to a long-term tenant.\n\nThe two-fold goal, he wrote, is to provide more incentive for the creation of secondary suites and to sync Toronto with provincial policy changes that support secondary suites across Ontario.\n\nSince 2011, an average of approximately 1,700 in Toronto have been built each year, \"which presents significant potential for additional secondary suites\" if the time restriction is lifted, Lintern wrote.\n\nKlaus Lehmann, a manager with city planning, says rules barring the creation of extra rental suites in new homes came from a desire to protect neighbourhood character, and to ensure new-build duplexes didn't become the norm. (Paul Smith/CBC News)\n\nThere's also an urban-suburban divide in the current restrictions. While downtown townhouses are allowed to have built-in rentals, suburban townhouses aren't.\n\n\"Toronto's a much older city \u2014 the old City of Toronto \u2014 and the row houses were developed at a time when that was a very common practice,\" Lehmann said.\n\nIn the city's suburbs, where smaller townhouses were a relatively new phenomenon compared to larger family homes, allowing basement suites wasn't seen as a priority.\n\nIn his report, Lintern recommends permitting secondary suites in townhouses across the city while introducing a maximum amount of floor space for each unit, to make sure it's not the primary living space for the home-owner.\n\nCoun. Ana Bailao, council's housing advocate, who was recently re-elected for another term in her downtown ward, is hoping the shift is given the green light from the public and council, given the city's current housing shortage.\n\nThe current restrictions, she said, make it more difficult to have a secondary suite than it should be.\n\n\"We need to change the policy to actually respond to the needs of our city,\" she added, noting around 70,000 families currently call secondary suites home, though not all of them are legal.\n\nLoosening the rules could help increase the \"gentle density\" of Toronto neighbourhoods and provide much-needed rental stock, while allowing home-owners to gain extra income to afford the city's sky-high home prices, Bailao said.\n\nSpeaking to the media on Thursday, Mayor John Tory agreed the rules should be relaxed, including the five-year requirement.\n\n\"[Suites will] still be subject to approval, obviously, but they'll now be subject to approval on a universal basis,\" he said. \"And I think it represents a very good opportunity for us to further increase the number of secondary suites that are available to rent across the city.\"\n\nCoun. Ana Bailao, left, is among those hoping Toronto will loosen regulations around secondary suites to help boost the city's housing stock.

Stephen Holyday, who was also re-elected in his Etobicoke ward in October.\n\n\"Many suburban areas ... don't allow on-street parking,\" he continued. \"How are you going to take care of the extra cars that come with the extra tenants? And how do you do that without annoying the neighbours?\"\n\nHe also stressed other possible \"unintended consequences\" could arise from zoning changes, including changing neighbourhoods' character and creating tension between neighbours.\n\nAffordable housing advocate Geordie Dent also questioned how much rental stock could actually be added by loosening the rules. Allowing more small-scale options like basement suites is beneficial, but not the \"be-all-end-all,\" said Dent, the executive director of the Federation of Metro Tenants' Associations.\n\nCoun. Stephen Holyday worries 'unintended consequences' could arise from zoning changes, including changing the character of neighbourhoods and creating tension between residents. (Paul Smith/CBC News)\n\nCity numbers suggest he has a point. According to Lehmann, there may not be large gains to be made given how few people already have legal secondary suites when compared to people looking to do them \"on the cheap.\"\n\nOnly around 2,000 people have applied to the city over the last 18 years since the suites were first permitted, he said.\n\nMore widespread city investment into building affordable housing, according to Dent, is a bigger necessity.\n\nSince 2009 \u2014 and amid rising rents that have now hit more than $1,200 on average for a one-bedroom unit in the GTA \u2014 the city's goal has been to approve 1,000 affordable units annually.\n\nThat target was only hit for the first time last year. Even so, Tory is promising to beef up the city's housing stock significantly by building 40,000 new affordable housing units over the next 12 years.\n\nBut striving to add more legal secondary suites by simplifying the process should remain part of that discussion as well, maintained Kanitz, who hopes the city ends its \"arbitrary\" time restriction.\n\nIn her case, since she's legally barred from renting out her basement for the next five years, she's using it to house Airbnb guests and international students instead.\n\nSo far this year, she's had a rotating assortment of short-term renters from Brazil, Mexico, and Japan. She said although she makes twice as much money as she would renting to a Toronto tenant, she would rather offer the unit to someone who needs a long-term home.\n\n\"These are people that don't work in Toronto, they don't pay taxes to Canada, and they're displacing \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 someone who lives in Canada ... who would otherwise probably love to live downstairs,\" Kanitz said.\n\nPublic consultations on secondary suites are happening throughout November, with all meetings running from 6:30pm until 8:30pm at the following locations:\n\nNovember 15: Metro Hall, Room 310, 55 John Street, Toronto\n\nNovember 26: Etobicoke Civic Centre, Main Boardroom, 399 the West Mall, Etobicoke\n\nNovember 21: North York Civic Centre, Committee Room 1, 5100 Yonge Street, North York\n\nNovember 27: Scarborough Civic Centre, Committee Room 1, 150 Borough Drive, Scarborough", "Police and FBI investigators have no word on a possible motive after a gunman entered a Southern California bar Wednesday night and shot dead 12 people, including a sheriff's sergeant, before killing himself.\n\nThe gunman was identified as U.S. Marine Corps veteran Ian David Long.

It will begin with 20,000 customers \u2014 moved over from Bell MTS as part of the deal with the Competition Bureau of Canada \u2014 and six retail locations in Winnipeg and Brandon.\n\nCustomers will make the switch in phases to be completed by the end of March 2019, an early November news release said.\n\nXplore Mobile is the wireless branch of New Brunswick-based Xplornet Communications Inc., which already provides internet to some Manitoba communities.\n\nThe company is branding itself on simplicity, transparency and fairness, including a new-to-Manitoba data rollover feature that allows customers to transfer unused data from one month to the next.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we're a bit different than the larger players who are \u2026 well established and maybe a bit more comfortable,\" said Sebastien Bouchard, communications director for Xplore Mobile. \"We know that we need to impress, we need to put our best foot forward.\"\n\nAs part of the Competition Board deal approved in Feburary 2017, the carrier will have access to the Bell MTS 4G LTE+ network for two years. During that time, Bouchard said Xplore will build its own infrastructure. About a quarter of it already exists, he said, as part of Xplornet's network.\u200b\n\nCustomers tapped to make the switch have already been notified by mail and will have to go in-person to a store to complete the process, Bouchard said. All 20,000 come from the Winnipeg and Brandon areas.\n\nNew carrier has 'a bit of a jump'\n\nKathy Knight, CEO of the Information and Communication Technologies Association of Manitoba, said Manitoba's telecommunications landscape is competitive, but Xplore Mobile's 20,000-customer headstart gives it an edge.\n\n\"I think there's also some opportunities for some growth,\" Knight said. \"When you look at a smaller service provider like Xplore Mobile \u2026 they are up against the Big Three. But they've got a bit of a jump.\"\n\nKnight pointed to under-served rural or remote areas of Manitoba that have long complained of poor cell coverage as \"niche opportunities\" \u2014 as long as Xplore can deliver improved service.\n\n\"In areas of the province that are really under-served or where connectivity is not that great, if they can actually move in and improve service in those areas they'll definitely have a great competitive advantage,\" she said.\n\nBouchard said Xplornet already has a reputation for serving rural customers and Xplore Mobile plans to expand coverage of those areas in Manitoba with its own network.\n\nChallenge will be if customers want data rollover: Knight\n\nKnight said Xplore has worked to position itself well among its competitors. Its promise of simplicity may appeal to wireless customers, she said, and the data rollover plan stands out on the market.\n\nThe carrier shouldn't have a problem retaining its customers, as long as it lives up to its promises, she added.\n\nAsked about the challenges it will face, Knight said the first one that comes to mind is whether customers will really want the data rollover plan it's selling itself on.\n\nSeveral rural or remote Manitoba have highlighted poor cell coverage in their area over the years.

Oshie watched the clock in the training room hoping he'd get back on the ice.\n\nOshie was back there for a second time Wednesday night after he took a shoulder to the head from Evgeni Malkin that made an earlier stick to the face seem like an afterthought. With Malkin ejected for the illegal check to the head, Oshie returned to score late and lift the Washington Capitals over the Pittsburgh Penguins 2-1 in a meeting of the two most recent Stanley Cup champions.\n\nThe Capitals forward needed two stitches to close a cut by his left eye and went through concussion protocol before returning to the game and becoming the hero by scoring with 1:14 left. Oshie doesn't care much what happens next to Malkin, who could get a hearing with the NHL department of safety. Oshie's focus is solely on Washington winning its second in a row.\n\n\"My face is a little messed up, but I'm feeling pretty good now,\" Oshie said. \"He caught me there, and it is what it is.

He got some help from the post on almost a half-dozen occasions, but Holtby also turned in his best performance of the season.\n\n\"I felt comfortable as the game moved on,\" Holtby said. \"I got some breaks, too, early on.

They have just one point during the skid and face the possibility of being without Malkin in the near future.\n\nPower play goes off the rails\n\nWith Pittsburgh on the power play early in the third period, Malkin passed the puck and lifted his right shoulder into Oshie's head and kept skating. The officials conferred before deciding to give Malkin a five-minute major penalty.\n\n\"He maybe thought I was coming to hit him and so he threw the reverse shoulder out there, which I try to do that all the time,\" Oshie said. \"I just wasn't expecting it being on the PK.\"\n\nPittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said it didn't matter what he thought of Malkin's hit and added he's not concerned about the star Russian centre facing further discipline.

He was powerless to stop Oshie's goal after a pass from John Carlson gave him a wide-open net.\n\nLate in a sloppy game full of turnovers and whiffs on the puck, Oshie just wanted to make sure he didn't shoot so high he missed the net. After missing most of the first and third periods, Oshie made the most of his only shot in 13:51 of ice time.\n\n\"I barely saw him on the bench there,\" center Nicklas Backstrom said. \"He came back right in time.

But this also means higher cost estimates to ensure greater accuracy.\n\nFor years, the development scenario on the Lower Churchill was to build the larger Gull Island project first.\n\nKean testified that any estimates related to this project were compiled based on a P75 model, meaning there was a 75 per cent chance of meeting targets.\n\nBut the Gull Island option, which relied on export sales outside of the province to make it viable, was set aside after efforts to get Hydro-Quebec approval to transmit power through Quebec failed.\n\nWho gave the directive?\n\nThe focus then shifted to the 824-megawatt Muskrat Falls and the Labrador-Island Link option, which was sold by government-owned Nalcor as the least-cost option for Newfoundland's future electricity needs.\n\nIt was sanctioned at a construction cost of $6.2 billion, with first power from Muskrat scheduled to occur in July 2017, but it's now become clear that these targets were long shots.\n\nCapital costs have since soared to $10.1 billion, but increases to $12.7 billion if you include financing charges. And first power is now delayed until sometime in 2019.\n\nFirst power from Muskrat Falls was originally scheduled for July 2017, but evidence at the public inquiry indicates that schedule was almost impossibly aggressive. (Nalcor Energy)\n\nKean was in charge of Nalcor's project services team ahead of sanctioning, which means he was heavily involved in developing cost and schedule estimates.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, he explained, his team was asked \u2014 for the first time \u2014 to prepare estimates based on the riskier P50 scenario.\n\nThat's despite the fact Nalcor's own risk assessment advisor, Westney Consulting, had recommended a P75, and therefore a higher cost estimate.\n\nSo where did this directive come from?\n\nWas it former Nalcor CEO Ed Martin, Gilbert Bennett, another senior executive, or project director Paul Harrington?\n\nKean said he couldn't remember, but said he did not have the authority to make such a change.\n\n\"It must have been requested,\" Kean said. \"Otherwise it wouldn't have been given, I guess.\"\n\nAll three are scheduled to testify in the coming days at the inquiry.\n\nAudit questioned the risky approach\n\nThe P50 model of preparing cost estimates was questioned by accounting firm Grant Thornton in its forensic and investigative audit of the decision to sanction Muskrat Falls.\n\nThe audit, which was commissioned by the inquiry, found that if Nalcor had used a P90, for example, it would have added nearly $800 million to the cost estimates.\n\nEvidence indicates that in addition to lowering the p-factor, Nalcor also eliminated any allowance for strategic risk, a figure estimated by Westney at nearly $500 million.\n\nA new document entered Wednesday reveals there was also no contingency for \"time risk or foreign exchange risk,\" though no amount was attached to these categories.\n\nAnd there's growing evidence that Nalcor removed the strategic risk allowance at the request of Emera, its partner on the Maritime Link project, because of Emera's concerns about getting approval from Nova Scotia's utility regulator.\n\nWhen asked about this, Kean said the request to reduce the \"risk exposure provision\" on the project came from Nalcor's investment evaluation team.\n\nAll this occurred with full knowledge that the provincial government, in a commitment made by then-premier Kathy Dunderdale, would \"backstop\" any cost overruns.\n\nFirst project team member to testify\n\nKean is the first member of the project management team to testify at the inquiry, and there were points Wednesday when the heat started to rise between Kean and Kate O'Brien.\n\nO'Brien, for instance, accused Kean of \"cherry-picking\" from a report that reviewed the capital cost estimates for Muskrat Falls.\n\nA quote from the report by Validation Estimating describing the estimates as \"one of the best megaproject base estimates that this reviewer has seen in some time\" was often cited by Nalcor and the provincial government when making the case for Muskrat sanctioning.\n\nBut the report was only presented in draft form, and O'Brien said the report was never widely distributed, and some critical elements of the report were never disclosed.\n\nAt one point, Kean's lawyer, Deborah Hutchings, said O'Brien has strayed \"over the edge\" with her questioning, but commissioners Richard LeBlanc ruled O'Brien's questions were acceptable.\n\nKean is scheduled for a second full day on the witness stand on Thursday, when he will be cross-examined by other lawyers at the inquiry.\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "Weed may now be legal in Canada but there are restrictions that users need to pay attention to.\n\nThat's what a Calgary man learned the hard way early Tuesday morning when he was stopped at a westbound roadblock on the Lions Gate Bridge and handed a $230 ticket under the new B.C.

At its centre is a young Toronto war photographer -- voiced by Elijah Wood. Creator Yoan Fanise speaks about his game. 7:05\n\nThe game, 11-11: Memories Retold, is an attempt to convey that reality. To do that, the game doesn't force players into combat \u2014 in fact, it's rated teen and features no graphic violence \u2014 but instead presents a narrative focusing on what the main characters are going through.\n\nFanise, creative director at DigixArt Studio, a video game studio in Montpellier, France, says 11-11: Memories Retold tells a fictional story about two ordinary people in the war that ended 100 years ago. The characters are Harry, a Canadian photographer, and Kurt, a German technician, voiced by Elijah Wood and Sebastian Koch.\n\nAccording to DigixArt Studio, millions of letters were sent during the First World War. (Memories Retold/Twitter)\n\nThe game begins on Yonge Street in Toronto on Nov. 11, 1916. Harry leaves Toronto as a young man to join the Western Front in Europe in the hopes of impressing a woman, while Kurt, an older man, is told that his son is missing in action on the front-lines.\n\nBoth characters then encounter the reality of war, crossing paths at the front and rear of the conflict.\n\nPlayers move the two characters through scenes, completing small, meaningful actions that move the story forward. Every scene in the game is designed to look like an impressionistic oil painting.\n\nGame contains many Canadian elements\n\nA still from the video game, 11-11 Memories Retold.

It goes beyond entertainment,\" Fanise said. \"This game is all about the two sides of war.\"\n\nDuring the game, players also have a chance to write letters to their loved ones, with an opportunity to choose what they present, just like Fanise's great-grandfather did when telling his family about his experiences.\n\nThe game's set to be released on Friday on various platforms.", "The former Saint John hockey coach accused of sexually assaulting a minor and luring a child took the stand Wednesday morning.\n\nScott Geikie testified that he did invite the alleged victim to his bedroom and that they kissed. He said that was the extent of the interaction in his apartment.\n\nGeikie is charged with one count of sexual assault against a minor between Jan. 1, 2009, and Dec. 31, 2010, and one count of child luring in August 2011.\n\nWednesday was the third day of testimony in Saint John Court of Queen's Bench.\n\nThe case was adjourned until Friday, when Justice Hugh McLellan will deliver his verdict.\n\nCrown prosecutor Shara Munn told the court in her final arguments that even if Geikie only kissed the accuser, it would constitute sexual assault because of his age or if there was no consent.\n\nVictim has memory gap\n\nThe alleged victim, whose identity is protected by a publication ban, previously testified he was 12 or 13 when the incident happened and possibly was drugged, since there is a gap in his memory.\n\nHe recalls waking up with his arms tied above his head and seeing Geikie masturbating to pornography. He also testified Geikie performed oral sex on him.\n\nGeikie denied those allegations and said he thought the boy was 16.\n\n\"We were just sitting there watching a movie,Geikie told the court. \"Then we started play-fighting type of thing and tickling each other, and we did kiss but that's the extent of it.\n\nHe said the two \"laughed it off,\" after the accuser told him he wasn't gay.\n\n'Two guys joking around'\n\nGeikie answered questions confidently and did not get emotional on the stand.\n\nThe allegations of child luring stem from a Facebook exchange from 2011, when Geikie asked the accuser to \"jerk off on cam\" for him.\n\nGeikie admitted to saying that but said he was \"joking.\"\n\n\"Would I take that stuff back? Yes.

Will it happen in 2 years?\n\nMcCallum has continually said that an independent police force could be up and running by the beginning of 2021.\n\n\"We'll be able to be up and running efficiently ... within two years. It is fast, but we're on a fast track in the city,\" he said at a news conference following council's vote.\n\nThe RCMP need at least two years formal notice from a city to leave a detachment, and Monday's motion only asks staff to start that process.\n\nMore to the point, moving to an independent police force requires provincial government approval \u2014 and there's no guarantee it would approve such an aggressive timeline.\n\n\"They have to have a transitional plan in place, in terms of how long it takes, in many ways that's up to them, in terms of getting the necessary information and put the plan together,\" said Solicitor General Mike Farnworth.\n\n\"It will take however long it takes, but until such time as a plan has been approved, and there's a lot that has to be dealt with, the current plan stays in place.\"\n\nDoug McCallum is sworn in as Surrey's mayor at a ceremony at city hall on Nov. 5, 2018. (Colin Fode/CBC)\n\n2. Where will the officers come from?\n\nThere are 835 RCMP officers in Surrey, and all of them will need to be replaced when an independent police force is created.\n\nBut McCallum believes that will be relatively straightforward, claiming about 50 per cent of Surrey officers have indicated they would leave the RCMP and go with the new local force, with the rest coming from other Metro Vancouver police forces.\n\n\"A lot of people that work, especially in Vancouver and West Vancouver, have indicated they'd like to work with the Surrey police department, because their families live in Surrey, and they want to be a lot closer to their families,\" he said.\n\n3. How much will it cost?\n\nIn 2016, the total costs for policing in Surrey were $147 million, according to the provincial government.\n\nThat's the second highest figure in British Columbia \u2014 but on a per capita basis, it's much lower than any large B.C. city that has an independent police force.\n\nPart of the reason for the discrepancy in costs is that salaries with independent police forces are generally higher.\n\nIn addition, the federal government provides 10 per cent of the costs for a municipality wishing to have an RCMP detachment.\n\n\"I'm a realist. There have to be other costs,\" said McCallum. He believes Surrey will save on administration costs, and that the RCMP will unionize in the next two years, making questions of salary increases irrelevant.\n\nSolicitor General Mike Farnworth said the provincial government won't sign off on allowing an independent police force until a detailed plan is agreed to. (Mike McArthur/CBC)\n\nBut many policing experts are skeptical Surrey will be able to keep its policing budget within 10 to 15 per cent of what it was under the RCMP.\n\n\"Are they understaffed in Surrey? Absolutely. Are they underpaid? Absolutely. So they're going ot have to look at those two things in particular, which is going to mean dollars. I don't know where Doug McCallum is coming from on costs,\" said Eddie MacDonald, co-chair of the National Police Federation.\n\n4. What will the transition period look like?\n\nThis is the area where McCallum has provided the fewest details to date: who will manage the transition, how much community consultation will happen and what values will guide the process.\n\n\"We [don't] have a clear sense of strategic direction of what a municipal force ... would need to police like. What its priorities would need to be. What it's leadership structure would need to be. What its accountability framework would need to be,\" said Wade Deisman, a criminology professor at Kwantlen University.\n\nHe said that in the weeks ahead, he'll be looking at how open McCallum is to appointing experts to lead the transition \u2014 and longer-term, if the first police chief chosen has a background conducive to a start-up organization.\n\n\"I admire the mayors' ambitions, and he's to be credited for wanting to fast-track it,\" said Deisman.\n\n\"But if you don't do things carefully and properly the first time, the mistakes you made will haunt you tenfold.\"", "Toronto Raptors guard Norman Powell is out indefinitely with a shoulder injury, the team announced Wednesday.\n\nThe Raptors said Powell suffered a partial dislocation of his left shoulder joint in the second quarter of Toronto's 124-111 win at Utah on Monday.\n\nNorman Powell leaves game with shoulder injury. <a href=\"https://t.co/3nCBNYZOyV\">pic.twitter.com/3nCBNYZOyV</a> \u2014@raptorsrepublic\n\nThere is no timetable for his return.\n\nPowell is averaging 5.0 points, 2.0 rebounds and 14.9 minutes in 11 games (two starts) this season.\n\nThe Raptors wrapped up a four-game road trip Wednesday night in Sacramento.\n\nToronto coach Nick Nurse told reporters before the game that he expected Powell to miss \"weeks.\"", "It's long been known that Alzheimer's patients often retain musical memories, even when recall of names, faces and places has been lost as the disease relentlessly destroys key areas of the brain.\n\nNow Canadian researchers believe they know why, thanks to the power of MRI brain scanning.\n\nToronto scientists enrolled 20 people with early-stage Alzheimer's or mild cognitive impairment in a study to discern what was occurring in their brains while they listened to familiar music and a composition they had never heard before while having MRI scans.\n\nWhen subjects listened to the previously unknown composition, it lit up a region of the brain known as the temporal lobe, \"which is what we would have predicted because that part of the brain gets activated when you listen to anything,\" said Dr. Corinne Fischer, director of the memory disorders clinic at St. Michael's Hospital and one of the researchers.\n\nBut when participants listened to familiar music \u2014 from a playlist of songs they had chosen going back at least 20 years \u2014 there was a much more extensive pattern of activation of several areas of the brain, including those involved with emotion and the processing of language, movement and memory.\n\n\"There's always been this question of why music and the ability to appreciate music is preserved, even in the latest stages of Alzheimer's disease,\" said Fischer.\n\n\"And I think one of the things this tells us is that it may be not so much the music as it is that familiar aspect of the music and the fact that that's activating parts of the brain that aren't typically damaged by Alzheimer's pathology.\n\n\"So that's why even though you might not know your name, you may not know your environment, you may still be able to appreciate a song because it's activating those areas that are not damaged.\"\n\nMichael Thaut, the study's lead author and a professor of music and neuroscience at the University of Toronto, said it's common for people in even relatively advanced stages of Alzheimer's to call to mind the melodies and lyrics of songs from their past, as well as the autobiographical memories attached to the music.\n\n\"They remember quite a bit of music,\" he said, adding that someone might say \"'Yes, this is Duke Ellington' or 'This was my favourite music when I went out with my wife.'\n\n\"But up to this point, we had no idea what the brain mechanisms are that drive these very long-lasting memories.\"\n\nCanadian researchers suggest people with Alzheimer's listen to familiar songs of the past each day and try to recall the life events the music evokes. (LightField Studios/Shutterstock)\n\nThat's why the researchers are excited about their findings, which were to be presented Wednesday as a \"hot topic\" at the Society for Neuroscience conference in San Diego.\n\n\"This is the first study that we're aware of that has actually studied these kinds of mechanisms and has come up with some ideas why the Alzheimer brain can retain music much longer than other stuff,\" said Thaut, who designed the research and analysed the data.\n\n\"So I think this is a breakthrough study.\"\n\n'Engage your brain in music'\n\nFor Colleen Newell, taking part in the research confirmed something she had long suspected \u2014 that her memory problems and difficulty with organization were signs of cognitive impairment.\n\n\"That's one reason I went into the study,\" said the 60-year-old guitarist, pianist and songwriter, one of about five professional musicians included in the research. \"Not only did I recognize I was dropping [forgetting] nouns, but that my mother has Alzheimer's.\n\n\"She's 80, and she was having similar memory issues at my age. So I wanted to have a baseline to see what was going on.\"\n\nAs part of the research, subjects were asked to listen to their playlist for an hour a day for three weeks, while trying to recollect associated life events and discussing them with family members or caregivers. They were then cognitively tested and also had their brains scanned again.\n\n\"What we found was there was improvement in brain functional connectivity, changes in brain activation and also improvements in memory scores, which told us that by exposing the brain repeatedly to this familiar music, people were actually improving cognitively and there was evidence that their brain was also changing,\" said Fischer.\n\nConnectivity is a measure of information flow between different brain regions, an important component of neurological function; enhanced connectivity and the other changes suggest that repeatedly listening to familiar music may give the Alzheimer-affected brain a cognitive boost, said Thaut, calling the results \"stunning.\"\n\n\"So I think we're sitting on something extremely important.\"\n\nFisher said these are preliminary results that need to be replicated in a much larger study, and future research also needs to determine if the beneficial effects of routinely listening to familiar music persist or are transient.\n\nStill, the researchers hope their findings may offer the basis for a targeted form of music therapy, with a goal of potentially slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease and possibly other types of dementia \u2014 none of which has an effective pharmaceutical treatment or cure.\n\n\"Alzheimer's disease at this point is non-reversible,\" said Thaut, who suggests people with the condition could mimic the study protocol on their own, by listening to familiar songs of the past each day and recalling the life events the music evokes.\n\n\"We cannot say you will be healthy,\" he said. \"But we can say if you engage in that kind of exercise with your family, your friends, with the caregiver, your spouse, even to go to concerts, just engage your brain in music, from the data we have there will be some cognitive benefit.\"\n\nWhile the research found that non-musicians seemed to make more cognitive gains than those who routinely play instruments, Newell said she hopes continuing the study protocol on her own \"will bump me up to keep me going.\"\n\n\"And also it encourages me to listen, just to listen to music,\" said Newell, a worship leader at a Toronto Anglican church, whose role includes spiritually based music. \"I guess just incorporating it more into my daily life.\"", "Three Nova Scotia members of the Bacchus Motorcycle Club have been sentenced to jail terms ranging from 18 months to three years on charges of extortion and extortion as members of a criminal organization.\n\nPatrick Michael James, 51, received the longest sentence Wednesday in Nova Scotia Supreme Court: two years on a charge of extortion and an additional year on the charge related to a criminal organization.\n\nJustice Peter Rosinski ordered that James must serve half his sentence before he can begin applying for parole. Typically, inmates can apply for parole after serving a third of their sentence.\n\nDuayne Jamie Howe, 49, received a total of two years for the same two charges. He must also serve three years probation when he completes his jail term. David John Pearce, 44, received an 18-month jail sentence and three years probation.\n\nPatrick Michael James was sergeant-at-arms for the Halifax/Hants County chapter of the Bacchus Motorcycle Club in 2012. (CBC)\n\nTheir convictions in July marked the first time the designation \"criminal organization\" has been applied by a judge to an outlaw motorcycle gang in Nova Scotia.\n\nLast month, a Crown prosecutor argued for sentences ranging from 4\u00bd years to six years. Defence lawyers sought jail time in the range of six months to two years.\n\nIn sentencing the trio Wednesday, Rosinski noted \"intimidation, extortion, harassment, threatening behaviour and physical violence are the stock in trade of such criminal organizations.\n\n\"They represent an elevated threat to civil society.\"\n\nBacchus Motorcycle Club member Duayne Jamie Howe at court earlier this year. (CBC)\n\nThe convictions stem from incidents in 2012 when a man, whose identity is protected by a publication ban, sought to bring a chapter of the Gentlemen's Motorcycle Club to Nova Scotia.\n\nThat club has no criminal affiliation but uses vests and patches similar to those worn by members of Bacchus, the Hells Angels and other outlaw motorcycle gangs.\n\nWhen James found out what the man was doing, he ordered him to destroy all the patches and stop any plans to open his own club chapter. When Pearce and Howe subsequently ran into the man at a motorcycle event, they threatened him.\n\nDavid John Pearce is one of three Bacchus Motorcycle Club members. (CBC)\n\nHe became so afraid, the court heard during this trial, that he and his wife installed a panic alarm in their home and sold their motorcycles.\n\nAs a condition of their sentences, the three Bacchus members are to have no contact with the man, his wife or five other people. All seven have their identities protected by a court order.\n\nRosinski noted the men have not renounced their past association with Bacchus and have not accepted responsibility or shown remorse for the crimes they've committed. Given that, he said their chances for rehabilitation are poor.\n\nIn addition to jail and probation, the men face a 10-year weapons ban and they must give DNA samples. They are also forbidden from associating with any members of Bacchus, the Darksiders, the Hells Angels or any other outlaw motorcycle club.\n\nGang paraphernalia that was seized when police raided homes and the Bacchus clubhouse have also been forfeited.", "Calgary council will not pursue the Olympics at any cost even if a plebiscite shows public support for the Games, Mayor Naheed Nenshi said on Wednesday.\n\n\"At some point after the plebiscite, and I don't know exactly when, council will then vote on whether to continue or suspend.

A team of researchers from Australia and Indonesia hiked for days and climbed a mountain to reach them \u2014 and spotted tiger tracks and snakes along the way.\n\nTheir goal was to more precisely determine the age of a series of images found within the caves, which were discovered in the 1990s.\n\nIt's believed that cave art began around 50,000 years ago. First there were lines, then hand stenciling and eventually figurative art depicting images from everyday life such as animals and people.\n\nThe researchers, whose findings were published in the journal Nature, divided the paintings in one cave into three categories that show that transition over time. The oldest images are red-orange paintings of animals, such as cattle, and hand stencils; followed by maroon-coloured hand stencils and depictions of humans; and finally, illustrations of humans, boats and black-coloured geometric designs.\n\nThe researchers used a method called uranium-series dating to determine the age of the cave art. (Luc-Henri Fage)\n\nDating cave art accurately has proven to be tricky. So the team, led by Maxime Aubert, who originally hails from Levis, Que., used a method called \"uranium-series dating.\"\n\nIt works like this: rainwater seeps through the limestone and dissolves small amounts of uranium. The uranium decays, producing another element, thorium. Uranium is water soluble, but thorium isn't. The researchers can take a sample of the cave and determine the ratio of uranium to thorium, allowing them to better calculate the age of the art.\n\nThis stencil of a hand was found in a cave in East Kalimantan, Borneo. (Kinez Riza)\n\nThe researchers determined that a painting of an unidentified animal, likely a species of wild cattle that is still found on the island, is at least 40,000 years old. It is the oldest known work of figurative cave art \u2014 art that depicts an image from real life.\n\nThey also dated maroon-coloured hand stencils from the same cave, including one that could be up to 51,800 years old.\n\nHistory of cave art\n\nWhile Europe is perhaps the most abundant source of cave art, works have been found throughout the world.\n\nFor most of the Ice Age, Borneo formed the easternmost tip of Eurasia. But after the ice started to melt and sea levels began to rise, it broke off and became one of the Indonesian islands.\n\nArchelogists make the perilous climb up the mountain in East Kalimantan, where the oldest figurative cave art was found. (Pindi Setiawan)\n\nSo cave art actually emerged around the same time in different corners of what had been the same continent.\n\n\"Most of what we know about how we lived in the Pleistocene is based on archeology and that's usually people's rubbish \u2014 what they left behind,\" Aubert said. \"With cave art, if we can date it, it provides a ton of information that we can't get with archeology \u2026 They're depicting their way of life and they're essentially talking to us 40,000 years later.\"\n\nWatch: The researchers explore the art-filled cave in Borneo\n\nAnd there are plenty of answers still to be found.\n\n\"Who the Ice Age artists of Borneo were and what happened to them is a mystery,\" said team co-leader Dr Pindi Setiawan, an Indonesian archeologist and lecturer at the Bandung Institute of Technology.\n\nHow exactly the art was made is also unknown.

A \"fresh-looking\" cigarette butt with a perfect match of Morrisseau's DNA was also found at the murder scene, he said.\n\nThe Crown prosecutor also told the jury there is evidence that Morrisseau bragged about the killing over the phone.\n\nThe cousin of the accused testified that Morrisseau called him and told him he got into a fight with Stinson, so he shot him and threw him in the river, the Crown attorney said.\n\n\"Frankly, do you really need anything beyond that? Wouldn't that alone do it?\" Ullrich asked the jury.\n\nWinnipeg police pulled Stinson's body from the Red River on June 12, 2015. (CBC)\n\n\"But then you have so much more on top of it,\" he said, adding that there are also text messages Morrisseau sent that appear to show him boasting about killing someone.\n\n\"I just split a wig bro,\" one of the texts entered into evidence read, Ullrich said.\n\n\"He's not talking about a hairdo. He's bragging about shooting Jason Stinson in the head with a shotgun,\" the Crown attorney added.\n\nThe evidence, Ullrich argued, suggests that Morrisseau planned to murder Stinson. Morrisseau was carrying the shotgun in a bag when the pair walked along the river together, Ullrich said, and shot Stinson point blank in the head.\n\n\"It was fatal. It was brutal. Nobody was going to survive that injury,\" Ullrich said.\n\nMorrisseau did not appear to panic after the shooting, and it took nearly two weeks for police to catch up with him, Ullrich told the jury.\n\nCrown's evidence 'speculation': accused\n\nMorrisseau, who appeared in court wearing a grey sweatshirt with long, messy brown hair, defended himself during the proceedings.\n\nAfter taking several notes during Ullrich's arguments, Morrisseau told the jury that the Crown's evidence was all \"speculation.\"\n\nHe argued that there were no witnesses placing him near the scene of the shooting, and there was no time stamp on the cigarette butt with his DNA on it.\n\nThe jury is expected to return Thursday morning to receive instructions from Justice Sheldon Lanchbery, who has presided over the trial, after which they will deliberate their verdict.\n\nThe trial began on Oct. 15, 2018.", "There's no reason to believe fires that broke out recently on two Halifax-based Royal Canadian Navy ships are sign of a widespread problem with the fleet, a senior military official said Wednesday.\n\nThe Defence Department continues to investigate the incidents aboard HMCS Halifax and HMCS Toronto, which occurred within days of each other last month.\n\nNavy Capt. Trevor MacLean, chief of staff for Maritime Component Command, said the navy is \"extremely confident\" the ships remain fit for service.\n\n\"We have a rigorous routine of preventative maintenance and inspections that occur,\" he said.\n\n\"After the initial days of the investigations, we're fairly confident already that there's absolutely no relationship between any of these occurrences.\"\n\nFire aboard HMCS Halifax\n\nThe first incident occurred Oct. 26, when a fire broke out in the starboard gas turbine enclosure in the forward engine room for HMCS Halifax, the Defence Department said Wednesday in a news release. The ship was deployed off the coast of Norway at the time.\n\n\"Upon discovery of the fire, the crew immediately engaged the fire suppression system and the fire was quickly extinguished,\" the release said. \"No one was injured.\"\n\nThe Royal Canadian Navy says there was a 'minor' fire onboard the HMCS Halifax on Friday Oct. 26 while on deployment off the coast of Norway. (CAF Operations Twitter)\n\nNavy officials said the incident did not effect the ship's operations and it was able to continue participating in military activities. The engine has since been repaired and is functioning normally.\n\n\"Initial indications are that the fire on board HMCS Halifax ... was a result of a clogged drain in the engine enclosure, but again more will be confirmed when the investigation is complete.\"\n\nLoss of power aboard HMCS Toronto\n\nThree days later, HMCS Toronto experienced a total loss of power while conducting operations and anti-ship missile defence training in the Hebrides Sea off the coast of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"The ship was able to restore power and safely sail to Belfast,\" said the release.\n\nWhen the ship arrived in Belfast on Oct. 30, a fire started in the same location as the one that happened on board HMCS Halifax. As with Halifax, it was quickly extinguished and no one was hurt.\n\n\"At this point, initial indications are that the cause of the fire on HMCS Toronto was due to a tank overflow,\" said the release. \"The ship is returning to Halifax as planned and while the engine is functional, it is being kept in reserve while the investigation concludes.\"\n\nProblems with a third ship this week\n\nEarlier this week and on the opposite coast, a third navy ship experienced technical problems.\n\nAccording to the release, HMCS Edmonton was conducting routine operations Monday in the eastern Pacific Ocean when it experienced a short loss of electrical power. Crew were able to restore power within a minute.\n\n\"When power was restored it was discovered that the electronic control of the propulsion system had not come back online. Eventually it was determined that two blown fuses were the cause of the propulsion failure.\"\n\nThe release noted the issue with HMCS Edmonton is not related to the other incidents because it's a different class of ship and has different types of equipment onboard.\n\nNo effect on operations\n\nMacLean said there's no threat of interruption to future operations and noted all three of the affected ships were able to complete their work.\n\nHe praised the ability of the ships' crews to deal with the problems as soon as they happened.\n\n\"All three ships are carrying on as initially planned,\" he said.", "A pilot project proposed for Calgary's suburbs could change the way public transit is delivered in the city.\n\nOn-demand transit would involve passengers in newer communities \u2014 where transit demand is insufficient \u2014 calling or using an app when they want to book a trip. The transit software would then create a route using the various passenger requests and tell them where and when they will be picked up.\n\nThe route would then link the passengers to a nearby transit station.\n\nWard 3 Coun. Jyoti Gondek and Ward 12 Coun. Shane Keating are sponsoring the project, which was presented this week to the city's priorities and finance committee.

In our city, we have people leveraging the service that we offer. We just need to make sure we are keeping up with the times and offering the service in a way that meets need and is most economical,\" Gondek said.\n\nWith files from the Calgary Eyeopener.", "U.S. President Donald Trump is warning House Democrats against spending the remaining years of his presidency investigating him and the administration.\n\nAt a post-midterms news conference Wednesday, Trump declared that Republicans will respond in kind if House Democrats flood his administration with subpoenas to seek his tax returns and investigate his business dealings, his cabinet's conduct and his campaign's ties to Russia. He added that Democrats have \"nothing, zero\" on him.\n\n\"They can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate,\" Trump said. \"If that happens, then we're going to do the same thing, and government would come to a halt, and we're going to blame them.\"\n\nTrump warns House Democrats about trying to investigate him:\n\nDonald Trump says people are tired of all the investigation talk and warns what will happen if Democrats pursue probes in Congress 0:49\n\nThe warning came minutes after Trump praised Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi for her role in the Democrats' successes yesterday and said he hoped the two parties could work together on a number of issues, including economic growth, infrastructure, trade, and lowering cost of prescription drugs.\n\nTrump said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi deserves to be House Speaker, and said he wanted to work together with her on a range of issues. (Al Drago/Reuters )\n\nIn a news conference shortly after Trump spoke, Pelosi said Democrats will have a \"responsibility for oversight\" when they take charge in the House in January, but she said committee requests for documents or hearings won't be \"scattershot.\"\n\nSessions out\n\nDuring his almost 90-minute session with reporters, Trump sidestepped questions about possible staffing changes in his West Wing or cabinet \u2014 including the fate of embattled Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 but hinted that moves could be coming soon.\n\nA little over an hour later, Trump tweeted that Sessions was gone.\n\n....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date. \u2014@realDonaldTrump\n\nSessions's resignation came after months of personal insults and criticisms from Trump over his recusal from the investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump blamed the decision for opening the door to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, who took over the Russia investigation and began examining whether Trump's hectoring of Sessions was part of a broader effort to obstruct justice.\n\nSessions's chief of staff Matt Whitaker will become the new acting attorney general.\n\nAttacks on media\n\nThe president repeatedly became irritated while taking questions from the media, insulting several reporters by name. Trump got particularly angry at CNN's Jim Acosta, when the journalist asked Trump why he was calling the caravan of migrants an \"invasion.\" When Acosta tried to follow up with another question, Trump said, \"That's enough!\" and a White House aide unsuccessfully tried to grab the microphone from Acosta.\n\nLater Wednesday evening, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders released a statement saying Acosta's press pass was suspended. She accused Acosta of \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern,\" calling it \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nWatch the exchange in question between Trump and Acosta:\n\nThe White House suspended CNN reporter Jim Acosta's press pass after accusing him of \"placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern\" during an exchange with Trump. 0:34\n\nTrump also ordered some reporters to sit down and he deemed one inquiry \"racist.\"\n\nI'm simply asking the questions the public wants to know. <a href=\"https://t.co/bZ1cZVBKhd\">https://t.co/bZ1cZVBKhd</a> \u2014@Yamiche\n\nTrump faces the prospect, starting early next year, of endless investigations after Democrats formally take control of the House, along with stymied policy efforts and fresh questions about the resilience of his unorthodox political coalition. Still, he celebrated Republicans' success in retaining the Senate.\n\n\"I thought it was very close to complete victory,\" he said.\n\nTruce with Trudeau?\n\nTrump was also asked about whether he has \"repaired\" his relationship with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau since the U.S., Canada and Mexico reached a new trade deal.\n\n\"Yes, I have.\" he said. \"We have a very good relationship.\"\n\nDeep tensions remain\n\nWidely viewed as a referendum on Trump's presidency, Tuesday's results offered a split decision that revealed deep tensions in the American electorate \u2014 a rift that could easily widen during two years of divided control of Congress. Trump's aggressive campaign blitz, which paid off in some key victories, suggests he is likely to continue leaning into the fray.\n\nControl of the House gives Democrats the ability to launch investigations into the president and stifle his agenda, but White House aides called on them to reach across the aisle.\n\n\"I don't know that there will be much of an appetite for Democrat lawmakers to spend all of their time, or most of their time or even a fraction of their time investigating, instigating, trying to impeach and subpoena people,\" said Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway.\n\nThe president telephoned Pelosi Tuesday night, a conversation that her office said included congratulations and a nod to her pitch for bipartisanship. He said today she deserves to be House speaker.\n\n\"I give her a lot of credit. She works very hard and she's worked long and hard. I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done and what she's accomplished,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump speaks during a news conference in the East Room at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press)\n\nIn addition to his conversation with Pelosi, Trump called Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, as well as other candidates he backed during the race, the White House said. And he downplayed reports of voter irregularity and suppression, particularly in Georgia, instead saying, \"I heard it was very efficient in Georgia.\"\n\nTrump had aggressively campaigned in the closing days of the race, his focus on boosting Republicans in states he carried in 2016.\n\nIn the three races he targeted on the final day, Trump's picks won Tuesday night, with Republican Mike Braun defeating Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Republican Josh Hawley defeating Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine defeating Democrat Richard Cordray in the race for Ohio governor.\n\nThe White House for days has stressed the historical headwinds it faced: In the last three decades, 2002 was the only midterm election when the party holding the White House gained Senate seats. And only twice in the past eight decades has the president's party picked up House seats in the midterms.\n\nTrump's scorched-earth campaigning came to define the 2018 campaign. In the final days, he sought to motivate supporters with the battle over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He said today that voters rebuked Senate Democrats over how they treated Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings.\n\nReturning to his immigration-heavy 2016 playbook, Trump went on to unleash his full fury on a caravan of migrants slowly making their way to the southern border.\n\nHis approach troubled many Republicans seeking to appeal to moderate voters in suburban House districts, but Trump prioritized base voters in the deep-red states that could determine the fate of the Senate.", "A group that pushes for better passenger rail service is wondering what happened to plans by Via Rail for new regional routes in the Maritimes.\n\nCompany president Yves Desjardins-Siciliano said in 2015 that proposals were being considered for launch in 2016.\n\nCanada doesn't end at Quebec City. - Ted Bartlett, Transport Action Atlantic\n\nThey included runs from Moncton to Halifax and from Campbellton to Moncton, first thing every morning, with return trips in the evening.\n\n\"It's getting cold and lonely out on that station platform, waiting for that train that hasn't come yet,\" Ted Bartlett, president of Transport Action Atlantic, told Information Morning Moncton.\n\nTed Bartlett is the president of Transport Action Atlantic. 9:31\n\nBartlett said several prospective start dates have come and gone and Via hasn't said anything about those plans in a long time.\n\n\"The only encouraging sign was about a year ago they sent a set of 60-year-old [rail diesel car] equipment down to the region to do a few test runs around Bathurst.\n\n\"Reportedly, everything went OK, but the point is nothing has happened.\"\n\nBartlett isn't very disappointed. He would rather Via restore daily service on the Ocean run, between Montreal and Halifax.\n\nSince 2012, it's only run three days a week \u2014 Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.\n\nBartlett said daily service is essential if Via wants to build ridership in the region and be a viable link between Atlantic Canada and the rest of the country.\n\nEven more so, he said, now that the federal government has announced a major investment to re-equip the service in the corridor between Quebec City and Windsor, Ont.\n\n\"Canada doesn't end at Quebec City,\" Bartlett said.\n\nTraditionally, Maritimers have been strong users of passenger rail, out of proportion to the population, he said.\n\nBig reduction since 1970s\n\nAnd there used to be twice daily service on the Ocean route in the late 1970s, when there was also a Halifax-to-Montreal service that went through a small part of Maine.\n\n\"The passenger rail network that we have in this country now is just a shadow of its former self,\" Bartlett said, blaming successive governments for not making the Crown corporation a priority.\n\nIn the last four years, though, the provincial and federal governments have announced $35 million to keep rail services in northern New Brunswick going.\n\nTed Bartlett, the volunteer president of Transport Action Atlantic, says the region has lost in the way of passenger rail service since the 1970s, and Via has been slow to make improvements recently. (CBC/Information Morning Moncton)\n\nAnd in a 2015 submission to the Canada Transportation Act review, the Atlantic Canada ministers of transportation acknowledged passenger rail service may be the only viable transportation option for many residents of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and will only become more important as the population ages.\n\nThey recommended the federal government provide resources for Via Rail to rebuild the service.\n\nBartlett said it wouldn't take much more money to bring back daily Ocean runs. He suggested it could possibly be done using existing equipment from the Quebec-Windsor corridor.\n\n\"This is equipment that is old, but it was built to last. \u2026 It can be refurbished.\n\n\"What the Ocean is presently operating is totally unsuitable to this climate. \u2026 It was built to operate in the U.K. and it is showing its age and it's becoming increasingly unreliable.\"\n\n'Great way to get around'\n\nBartlett said trains could be a very reliable means of transportation again if Via would \"get back to basics\" and operate on a schedule that works for people.\n\n\"It's a great way to get around this country of ours in the wintertime,\" he said.\n\n\"A snowstorm hits and the airports are closed.

Watch it here.\n\nThe search for aliens\n\nThe interstellar object appeared by the sun a year ago, and disappeared from view in January.\n\nAt first scientists assumed it was a comet, then an asteroid, before acknowledging that it was unlike anything they had ever detected before \u2014 400 metres long by 40 metres wide, tumbling end over end and travelling at speeds of up to 315,000 kilometres an hour.\n\nResearchers in Hawaii gave it a romantic name, Oumuamua, meaning \"a messenger that reaches out from the distant past.\"\n\nBut it took two Harvard University professors to make it famous, via a new paper which suggests that the unexplained object might be some sort of alien probe.\n\nThis artist\u2019s impression shows the first interstellar asteroid, Oumuamua, as it passed through the solar system after its discovery in October 2017. (Reuters)\n\nThe evidence to support this notion is a bit scant, but the search for extraterrestrial life has always required a certain amount of imagination.\n\nTake, for example, a paper published late last month in the International Journal of Astrobiology, which theorizes that the reason we haven't yet found alien life is that we're looking for little green men instead of purple ones.\n\nThe study, by two American microbiologists, suggests that the first forms of life on Earth might have been a shade of lavender, because they captured solar energy via a molecule called retinal, which made both the organisms and whole planet appear purple. Something we might be missing in the cosmos because we're busy looking for the \"red edge\" reflection of far-away worlds filled with green plant life.\n\nOr maybe it's just because we've hardly looked at all.\n\nA bunch of mathematicians at Pennsylvania State University recently created a brain-stretching model that tries to capture just how much space we have yet to scour for alien life \u2014 eight dimensions with a volume of 6.4 \u00d7 10116 m5Hz2 s/W, which sounds awfully large.

It's estimated that humans have so far surveyed only a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of space. (Carlos Moreno/Associated Press)\n\nEven before the new Oumuamua theory, the search for extraterrestrials was heating up.\n\nLast month, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine unveiled a U.S. Congress-mandated report on the future of space exploration, which calls on NASA to look for signs of alien life as part of every mission. Now that we have discovered thousands of exoplanets, we should always be on the lookout for the possible biosignatures of otherworldly creatures, the study argues, calling on the U.S. space agency to develop \"flight ready instruments\" and imaging systems to carry out the search.\n\n(This past weekend, NASA answered their plea by awarding a $7 million US grant to the Laboratory for Agnostic Biosignatures to start laying the groundwork for such explorations.)\n\nMeanwhile, the Trillion Planet Survey, a new project at the University of California Santa Barbara, is using a \"pipeline\" of software to process images of the Andromeda galaxy. It's looking for evidence of optical signals from faraway civilizations, instead of the radio waves we have been listening for since the early 1960s.\n\nRadio telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array are seen in Hat Creek, Calif. A new project searching the heavens concentrates on optical signals rather than radio waves. (Ben Margot/Associated Press)\n\nAnd a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal this week suggests that Earthlings adopt a similar signalling approach, creating a powerful 1 or 2 megawatt laser beacon to beam our presence into deep space \u2014 turning on what one of the scientists calls \"Earth's Porch Light.\"\n\nOver the past few months, the U.S. Congress has been considering whether it should again start funding the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project, better known as SETI, reversing 25 years of indifference.\n\nAnd then there's Donald Trump's calls for the creation of Space Force, a new branch of the U.S. military. The American president has suggested that there's a need to safeguard the world in case other powers like Russia and China decide to wage war outside the atmosphere.\n\nBut conspiracy theorists aren't convinced. They think the real purpose of Space Force is to fight off a pending alien attack.\n\nHowever, given that the theory's main proponent is the same website that spread the anti-Democrat \"pizzagate\" whopper, it is surely \"fake news.\"\n\nTennessee taunting\n\nAdrienne Arsenault is in Nashville, Tenn., covering the U.S. midterm elections.\n\n\"Shake it off, shake it off\" is the less-than-original, more-than-gleeful Twitter taunt to Tennessee's Taylor Swift this morning.\n\nShe of the \"Go vote\" Instagram post \u2014 urging those in the state to register and cast their ballot for Democrat Phil Bredesen for senator \u2014 was mercilessly mocked online as soon as Republican Marsha Blackburn was declared the winner last night.\n\nDuring his midterm election campaign Democratic candidate and former Gov. Phil Bredesen pledged to work with anyone, including President Trump, if he thought it would be best for Tennessee. (Mark Humphrey/Associated Press)\n\nThe superstar may mope at the result, but the nudge to get Tennesseans engaged may indeed have made a difference. While the wait is on for total turnout numbers, there was a 700 per cent boost in young voters in Tennessee in early voting compared to the 2014 midterms.\n\nThat's not a typo. The caveat, though, is that Tennessee ranked dead last in turnout in 2014, so any improvement will boost the percentages.\n\nSo yes, the enthusiasm is a win. The taunts are less so.\n\nTennessee is a curious place for the way it seems to be trying to tamp down some of the nastiness in American political discourse, and its newspapers appear to be leading the charge. The Chattanooga Times Free Press, for example, makes a point to always ensure it has two editorials, one liberal and one conservative.\n\nThe Tennessean newspaper is going a little farther \u2014 last January it launched Civility Tennessee, a year-long project that is dedicated to highlighting those who reach across divides. The editors appear to go well out of their way to find the people who manage to disagree without rancor and seek solutions that look like compromises.\n\nThe goal seems to be to avoid what some refer to as a \"long-term civic divorce.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to last night.\n\nThe democratic candidate was trying to ride that civility wave. Bredesen made a point of saying he would work with anyone, President Trump included, if he thought it would be best for Tennessee.\n\nUntil the dawn of voting day, the pollsters thought this grand experiment in the spirit of civility might work, might send a message that moderate voices could be the future.\n\nRep. Marsha Blackburn greets supporters Tuesday in Franklin, Tenn., after she was declared the winner over former Gov. Phil Bredesen. Blackburn's campaign supported many of the policies of the Trump administration. (Mark Humphrey/Associated Press)\n\nBut the conservative south stayed red, and elected a senator who campaigned in the image of the President. Blackburn warned of the dangers of the caravan, encouraged the building of the border wall, and slammed her opponent.\n\nThat's politics. And that's particularly politics now, with the middle ground still elusive.\n\nAll this makes the Civility project so much more curious. The experiment ends in two months.

At the time, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King argued that opening Canada's door to any of the refugees would lead to further claims after the war.\n\nThe ship eventually took its passengers back to Europe, where many died at the hands of the Nazis.\n\nToday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is formally apologizing to the Jewish community for Canada's refusal to offer sanctuary to any of those refugees.\n\nSol Messinger, centre, and his parents aboard the MS St. Louis on its voyage to Cuba in 1939. (Sol Messinger)\n\nMiraculously, Sol's family survived the war \u2014 but not without trauma. They were arrested and sent to a detention camp in France, where living conditions were brutal. They were separated and starved before escaping and securing passage on another ship bound for the U.S. in 1942.\n\nOf the passengers on the MS St. Louis, 288 were sent to England and survived. Another 87 managed to leave Europe in 1940. Of those who didn't find sanctuary from the Nazis, 278 survived the holocaust and 254 perished in concentration camps in Europe.\n\n\"I think the Canadian apology is really important for Canadians, for Canadian youth, because it's important for them to say we did this and we were wrong, and we hope that we never do that again,\" Messinger says.\n\nWATCH: Sol Messinger's story and more on Prime Minister Trudeau's apology tonight on The National on CBC Television and streamed online\n\nREAD: Perlita Stroh's feature about Sol Messinger and the MS St. Louis\n\nPaying homage to a fallen Canadian\n\nWhile researching a story about a memorial to Canadian Pte. George Price, the last British Empire soldier killed in WWI, producer Stephanie Jenzer and her team discovered a remarkable radio recording in the CBC archives \u2014 as well as a community that has embraced his memory.\n\nWhile many Canadians may know Pte. George Price from history books, few know him quite as intimately as the Belgians.\n\nPrice, born in Nova Scotia in 1892, is widely believed to be the last Commonwealth soldier killed during the First World War. He was shot by a sniper, on Belgian soil, unaware that a war that had already claimed more than 60,000 of his compatriots was itself heaving its final dying breaths.\n\nCanadian Pte. George Price, the last British Empire soldier killed in WWI, was shot by a sniper just two minutes before the armistice came into effect at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918. (Price family)\n\nAcross Canada and around the world there are countless monuments to the fallen, just like Price. But many are impressionistic markers, whether it's that towering symbol of sacrifice at Vimy or a small cenotaph in a community near you. They are memorials that honour all who gave their lives to war.\n\nBut that last victim of the Great War had a name and a face many wanted to hold onto. Not because his story was particularly special, but precisely because it was a symbol of so much more \u2014 of the inexplicable loss and senseless tragedy that all too often comes with war.\n\nHere is a remarkable bit of radio tape we managed to dig up in the CBC archives, a 1965 CBC interview with a veteran named Arthur Goodmurphy. He describes being with Pte. Price on patrol that day in 1918, and how the soldier was shot and fell lifeless into his arms just two minutes before the armistice came into effect at 11 a.m. almost 100 years ago.\n\nArt Goodmurphy recounts how Canadian Private George Lawrence Price was shot and died in his arms on Nov. 11, 1918 -- the last soldier of the British Empire to be killed in action in WWI. (CBC archives) 2:22\n\nThere are other perhaps more romantic versions of Price's final moments, including the story of a young woman who waved to him from across a road, prompting him to step out from the protection of a house into the line of fire.\n\nBut while some of the fine details have varied slightly over the past century, the municipality of Le Roeulx, near Mons Belgium, has remained unwaveringly loyal and grateful to the man, and the name George Price.\n\nThere's the school named in his honour. And there's quite a long footbridge dedicated to Price as well, not to mention the woman who lives next to the bridge who greets visitors at the door with a portrait of him clutched close to her heart.\n\nMarilyn Lahaie, who lives near the bridge named after George Price, holding her portrait of the fallen Canadian soldier. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\nAnd now, there's a new addition to Le Roeulx's growing testament to their Canadian hero \u2014 a monument commissioned and sculpted in Price's honour.\n\nBelgian artist Sylvain Patte has laboured over the statue in a nearby quarry for many months \u2014 much of 2018, in fact. He drew inspiration from, among other things, spending a night in the very spot Price is believed to have been killed.\n\nCBC correspondent Nahlah Ayed, videographer Pascal Leblond and I recently spent some time with Patte and the massive pieces of bluestone that he has carved and buffed and readied for a grand unveiling this coming Remembrance Day weekend.\n\nBelgian artist Sylvain Patte works on the George Price memorial. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\nTo give you a sense of the respect the Pte. George Price name commands locally, Le Roeulx has an official population of just 8,500 people, yet a Belgian Princess and the Prime Minister are scheduled to show up for the occasion.\n\nCanada will get its own sneak peek, with a special documentary on the life and legacy of Pte. George Price tonight on The National. The monument may not be what everyone expects, but it's a good bet you will find it memorable.\n\nAfter all, as Sylvain Patte told us, it's important to preserve history for the children.\n\nWATCH: The story about Pte.

However, the league had a meeting Sunday and the three teams indicated they're committed to the upcoming season.\n\n\"We know that they're frustrated with where they are,\" Hounsell said.\n\nThe Deer Lake team isn't the only one that struggled to find enough players. The Stephenville team lost an all-star goalie, he said, and other players have moved away or have limited availability. The Port aux Basques team has also had trouble getting together enough players for the season.\n\nIf another team were to fold, the league wouldn't be viable, Hounsell said. But for now the league will push through this season and reassess.\n\n\"We do have a problem, as well, on some other teams, but we're going to stick it out.\"\n\n'It's not going to happen'\n\nBoth Williams and Hounsell said the difficulty in finding players comes from a shortage of eligible people in the area.\n\nPeople are moving out of town, back into town, and that's the way small towns work in western Newfoundland. - Wayne Hounsell\n\n\"You do need numbers because people are moving out of town, back into town, and that's the way small towns work in western Newfoundland,\" said Hounsell.\n\nThe wide area the Deer Lake team covers \u2014 from Pasadena up the Northern Peninsula \u2014 is a challenge, Williams said, as is the fact that people often have to travel or move for work or education.\n\n\"We don't really have anything that boosts young people to stay in our area,\" she said.\n\nSome players had limited availability because of work schedules, which might work with a larger roster but didn't when things were already tight, she said. The shortened season of 12 games, and the limited size of the league, magnifies those complications.\n\n\"'When you're starting off with 15 players, how many players are actually going to go to Port aux Basques and play these games with us?\" Williams asked.\n\n\"It's not going to happen.\"\n\nAddressing rumours\n\nHounsell hopes the league can get back to four teams and continue to play for fans.\n\n\"We attempted to provide a product that people would enjoy watching,\" he said.\n\nThose people have made it clear they want amateur players, Hounsell added. Even if paying players would initially help bring people to the team, it wouldn't work long-term because teams would be left with large debts that would force them to fold.\n\nWilliams said she hopes people know that the decision not to play this season was a tough one for the Red Wings, and that they hope to have a team back on the ice next year.\n\n\"We never wanted to fold the team.\"\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "A person familiar with the situation says free-agent Dez Bryant and the Saints have agreed on contract terms that will add the former Dallas Cowboys star to one of the NFL's top offences in New Orleans.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press Wednesday on condition of anonymity because the roster move has not been announced.\n\nThe 30-year-old Bryant spent his first eight years in the NFL with Dallas and last season caught 69 passes for 838 yards and six touchdowns, including a 50-yard scoring play, for the Cowboys.\n\nHowever, his professional reputation has been marred at times by public confrontations with coaches and teammates during games and practices.\n\nSeeking salary cap relief, the Cowboys released Bryant after last season with two years remaining on the receiver's five-year, $70-million US contract.", "The family of Leroy Custer desperately wants to hear from him.\n\nCuster, 33, is from Pelican Narrows, Sask., more than 400 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.\n\nHe was last seen in June in Flin Flon, Man., about 85 kilometres southeast of Pelican Narrows.\n\nSince then, no one has heard from him.\n\n\"[His mother is] worried sick,\" said cousin Crystal Sewap. \"She's been searching and searching, and now she's overwhelmed and getting depressed.\"\n\nCuster's family said he didn't pick up his welfare check at the band office in Pelican Narrows in June, and hasn't logged into Facebook.

One of those frigates and a coastal-defence ship in the Pacific also experienced power outages.\n\nCrew members were able to put out the fires quickly and restore power in each incident.

A clogged drain in the engine enclosure is believed to have been the culprit.\n\nThree days later, HMCS Toronto lost power while patrolling off Britain. Power was restored, but a fire broke out in the engine room after the ship docked in Belfast. Indications are that a tank overflow, likely caused by the power outage, was to blame.\n\nWhile HMCS Halifax escaped without significant damage and remains deployed, MacLean said HMCS Toronto is heading back to Canada and that the affected engine is \"quarantined,\" meaning it can only be used in an emergency.\n\nThe most recent incident came Monday, when the coastal-defence ship HMCS Edmonton also lost power while involved in a U.S.-led drug-interdiction mission in the Pacific.

Nanaimo, B.C.-based Tilray Inc., which trades its shares on the Nasdaq exchange in New York, closed up by more than 28 per cent.\n\nLate in the day Wednesday, all those pot stocks were pushed even higher by the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one of the most virulently anti-cannabis politicians in the country.\n\n\"If the House flips to Democrats as is expected and Jeff Sessions resigns after the elections, that gives more psychological impetus for pro-cannabis legislation to pass,\" said Chris Damas, editor of investment newsletter the BCMI Report, before Sessions stepped down.\n\nAnalyst David Kideckel at Altacorp Capital, who covers cannabis companies, viewed Tuesday's election results as mildly positive for the sector as a whole.\n\n\"We see these states' push towards some form of cannabis legalization, whether recreational or medical, as one further catalyst towards U.S. policy change at a federal level, which we expect to happen over time.\"\n\nThe Democrats taking control of the House is also broadly supportive of marijuana over the long term, but likely not enough to lead to any firm steps on the federal level as long as the status quo persists.\n\n\"We view this as a positive catalyst for the cannabis sector,\" he said.\n\nDamas says while he still thinks some of the big Canadian names listed above are overhyped, he has been advising clients to move money into some of the smaller U.S. companies with presences in multiple states\n\nMichigan opting for recreational weed was significant because of its large population, but ballot measures in North Dakota and Missouri were less important.\n\nUtah opting for medical weed, however, was of note simply because it shares a border with Colorado, the U.S. state where the cannabis sector is flourishing the most.\n\n\"I believe Colorado's huge cannabis growth has been in part because it has been an island surrounded by prohibitionist states,\" he said.\n\nHe says the Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives is a positive sign for cannabis over the long term, but he says it's not a given that legal pot in the U.S. would be a boon for Canadian companies like the ones listed above.\n\nInstead, he thinks some of the lesser U.S. companies have the most to gain. \"The U.S. players will soon have as much market capitalization as the Canadian companies or more,\" he said. \"These are Barbarians at the cannabis gate in my view,\" adding that he thinks it's more likely in the long run that U.S. cannabis names will one day try to take over the big Canadian players than the opposite happening.\n\n\"Do the Canadian operators risk missing the train in U.S. federally legal cannabis the longer it is delayed?\" Damas said. \"I would say, yes.\"", "Mounties say a man has been charged in connection with a homicide investigation in Alexis Creek, B.C., about 100 kilometres west of Williams Lake.\n\nRCMP say 23-year-old Kyle Tyler Gilpin has been charged with second-degree murder, obstructing justice and uttering threats of death or bodily harm.\n\nMounties say the homicide happened on Oct. 19 and Gilpin was arrested the next day, but police didn't reveal the identity of the victim.\n\nGilpin will appear in Williams Lake Provincial Court on Wednesday in connection with all three charges.\n\nAlexis Creek is in the the Chilcotin District of the province, located between Williams Lake and Bella Coola.", "Sheldon Kennedy's sexual abuse case against hockey coach Graham James rocked Canadian sport in the late 1990s, and Canada stepped up, writing one of the strongest sexual harassment and abuse policies in the world, experts say.\n\nBut 20 years later, most believe Canada has fallen asleep on the job. When it comes to protecting its athletes, the country now lags behind the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom, according to a recent report. The ongoing trial of gymnastics coach Dave Brubaker plus high-profile cases in Alpine Canada and the Canadian Olympic Committee are proof.\n\nWhat's going on when the lights of Canada's arenas and gymnasiums are dimmed? And why have people remained mum about it?\n\n\"What we had was really progressive in the mid-90s to early 2000s, and it's just become stale,\" said Peter Donnelly, a kinesiology and physical education professor from the University of Toronto.\n\n\"Now we know a lot more about the way abuse occurs in sport, we have a much better sense of how tracked the athletes are once they're in the system, when their parents have committed so much money and time to it, when very often the abuser has groomed their parents, kids and young adults feel trapped, they're getting closer to their dream, and this is happening to them.\"\n\nBrubaker is the former coach of the national women's gymnastics team. He's pleaded not guilty to sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching at a trial that will resume next month in Sarnia, Ont.\n\nIn June, Canada's Sport Minister Kirsty Duncan announced that national sport organizations (NSOs) would lose their funding if they didn't immediately disclose to her office any allegations of abuse or harassment. She also said having an independent third party investigate all allegations of abuse will be a requirement of government funding.\n\nProcedure not being followed\n\nIn their recent paper, however, Donnelly and fellow U of T professor Gretchen Kerr say those policies have been in place since 1996, as part of the Sport Canada Accountability Framework. They're just not being adequately applied.\n\nIn \"Revising Canada's Policies on Harassment and Abuse in Sport,\" Donnelly and Kerr found that of the 42 NSOs and their provincial counterparts (PSOs) they interviewed, only 13.9 per cent of NSOs, and 10 per cent of PSOs (provincial sport organizations) identified a harassment officer. None of them identified the officer as third-party or \"arms length.\"\n\nKerr and Donnelly say sport has to get away from self-regulation.\n\n\"That's what we've had since 1996, and between our research and the high-profile cases that have emerged, it's clear evidence that self-regulation is not working,\" Kerr said, noting the other major sectors of society \u2014 the Catholic Church and Boy Scouts, for example \u2014 that have moved away from self-regulation.\n\nKerr, who's volunteered with Gymnastics Canada as an athlete welfare officer for 30 years, said the problem is multifaceted. It's difficult to find volunteers to perform a highly-specialized job. Some cases are incredibly time-consuming. And often, the job falls to an NSO staff member, \"often times their own CEO,\" she said.\n\n\"Which is just crazy, it's a huge conflict of interest,\" Kerr said.\n\nShe recounted a case in her early days with Gymnastics Canada where a coach was making sexually inappropriate comments to athletes.\n\n\"When I brought it forward to the sport organization, they said 'Well, we're not going to do anything about this coach, the Olympics are six months away, and he's got half the Olympic team,\"' Kerr said. \"You can't have people within the organization dealing with these cases. When you think about it, the CEO of any sport organization, their funding is dependent on Sport Canada's funding, and what is Sport Canada's funding based on? Performance of the athletes and the team.\n\n\"It's a crazy system where the CEO's job security is based on how well the athletes perform. It's no wonder that cases like what we saw in USA Gymnastics happen.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested last month on charges of evidence tampering in the case of Larry Nassar. Nassar is serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of medical treatment.\n\nCanada has had its own high-profile cases. Marcel Aubut resigned as COC president in 2015 after an investigation over numerous sexual harassment complaints. In June, several former members of Canada's ski team spoke publicly about the abuse suffered at the hands of former coach Bertrand Charest in the 1990s. Charest was convicted last year of 37 offences of sexual assault and exploitation. The athletes said they were instructed by Alpine Canada to keep quiet for fear of losing corporate sponsorships.\n\nFormer Olympic sprinter Desai Williams was recently banned for life by Athletics Canada for violating the organization's sexual harassment policy. The alleged conduct took place in 2010.\n\nIn a study conducted over 20 years ago by Canadian professor Sandy Kirby, 21.8 per cent of elite athletes reported having had sex with an authority figure in sports; 8.6 per cent reported they had raped by someone within their sport.\n\nPressure to remain silent\n\nPaul Melia, the president and CEO of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, compares today's sex abuse crisis to the doping climate in Canadian track and field in the late 1980s. Everyone knew it was going on. Few spoke up.\n\n\"We can look at Marcel Aubut and say: look at the reign of terror under his rule there, and the things that he did and said to women. People saw it. People saw it and turned a blind eye,\" Melia said. \"Why? Probably at the most basic level, because he was bringing a lot of money into the COC.\"\n\n\"These kinds of conflicts of interest . . . make it impossible for sports to self-regulate around that issue, just like Dubin (Charles Dubin led Canada's doping inquiry in the Ben Johnson fallout) found with respect to doping that those same sort of conflicts of interest were operating. So, we all knew Ben was doping, government officials, coaches, doctors, administrators, other athletes, but no one said anything. He was the fastest man in the world, it was fantastic. And, the belief was that everyone else was doing it anyways, so really we were just levelling the playing field. And so no one said anything.\"\n\nMelia would like the CCES, which runs Canada's anti-doping program, to be Canada's sex abuse watchdog. The CCES has put a proposal into Sport Canada to convene a committee of experts both within and outside sport such as police, child services, even the Catholic Church and Boy Scouts, to build one national safe-sport program.\n\n\"So, like the anti-doping program, one universal code with a set of rules, everyone in sport has to adopt and abide by, one set of definitions of what constitutes violations, and . . . most importantly, the victim has a place to come, an independent agency that they know will deal confidentially with their information, we'll investigate it, we'll assert a violation if the evidence is there, and we'll defend their rights,\" he said.\n\nThe CCES operates an anonymous tip-line to report doping suspicions in Canada, and Melia said it's very effective. A similar tip line to report sexual harassment or abuse would be a huge step in the right direction.\n\nThe USOC operates one through its SafeSport program, but as Donnelly pointed out: \"What they've done again is very in-house.\"\n\nDonnelly, Kerr and Melia all hope the .MeToo movement and the high-profile sex abuse cases lead to a watershed moment in Canadian sport.\n\n\"It's of course my best hope,\" Kerr said. \"I must say I am holding my breath because we were in this same situation in the mid 1990s when the Sheldon Kennedy case broke, and the Paul Hickson case in the UK (the British swim coach was sentenced in 1995 to 17 years in prison for sexual assaults on teenagers).\n\n\"There had been these high profile cases come out in the media from a number of countries, everyone got into crisis mode, and Sport Canada responded with the mandate that is currently in effect. And of course it hasn't worked. So, I'm hoping that people recognize the historical background on this and take a different approach than the one that was taken in 1996.", "A woman in her 80s was taken to hospital this morning after she was hit by a car in C\u00f4te-des-Neiges.\n\nPolice say she was crossing de la Peltrie Street at L\u00e9gar\u00e9 Street around 9 a.m. when she was struck by a car heading south on L\u00e9gar\u00e9.\n\nThe woman has upper body injuries, but her life is not in danger, said Const.

There are four daily draws, with each filling up 10 sheets spread across two larger ice rinks right beside one another inside the Tournament Centre.\n\nThe teams are split into two tiers of competition. On the Tier 1 side, the top 15 men's and women's teams according to the World Curling Tour's Order of Merit standings are competing.\n\nThe usual curling characters at the top of the list are here: Rachel Homan, Brad Gushue, Jennifer Jones, Kevin Koe, Casey Scheidegger, Nik Edin and many more have the locals buying up tickets to see them. Event passes have been sold out for months, though there are still tickets available for individual draws.\n\nThere are three pools of five teams in both the men's and women's tournaments. The top eight teams make the playoff round, with the championship games being played on Sunday. The Tier 1 champions take home $25,000 and earn spots in the Champions Cup to finish the Slam season.\n\nSo far this season, Gushue and John Epping have collected Slam wins on the men's side, while Anna Hasselborg has captured both women's Slams. Hasselborg is not in Thunder Bay this week, opening up the door for another women's team to get its first win of the season.\n\nPriceless opportunity\n\nSome of the best up-and-coming curling teams in Canada and internationally make up the Tier 2 division, which also features both a men's and women's tournament.\n\nWhile winning some cash is key for Tier 2 teams, who don't garner the sponsorship dollars of many of the elite rinks, there's another prize worth more than money could buy.\n\nThe winning men's and women's teams in the Tier 2 division will also get to play in the Champions Cup, right alongside the top teams. So winning in Thunder Bay allows these lesser-known rinks to catapult into the upper echelon of the curling ranks.\n\nThe Tier 2 tournaments include 10 men's and 10 women's teams that are further down the world rankings, and the rest of the field is drawn from the Thunder Bay region.\n\nThey follow the same playoff format as the Tier 1 division, with the top eight teams advancing to the playoff round and the championships played on Sunday.\n\nThe next stop on the Slam schedule comes a month from now in Conception Bay South, NL.", "Residents of a rural community in Nova Scotia's Shelburne County are upset that a 105-hectare clearcut has been approved in the area, despite a petition against it that was signed by more than 300 people.\n\n\"I think everybody's heart kind of fell,\" said Shelly Hipson, who started the petition opposing the clearcut in Middle Clyde River.\n\n\"We thought we had it licked, actually, with that many signatures, and \u2026 that [the petition] was being considered, but obviously it wasn't strong enough. So we're really disappointed.\"\n\nHipson said the forest in question is an important recreational area for locals, herself included, having grown up going into the woods with her family.\n\n\"We would spend the day actually making it back through Crown land to the camps,\" she said. \"Those memories are still in my heart, and they're in the hearts of many of us.\"\n\nFrustrated by lack of meeting\n\nThe number of people who signed the petition represents about 80 percent of the Middle Clyde River area's total population, according to Hipson.\n\nShe said she's not against the forestry industry, but calls it \"just so disrespectful\" that neither Westfor, the mill consortium doing the cutting, nor the Department of Lands and Forestry had met with residents regarding the logging.\n\nWestfor general manager Marcus Zwicker told CBC's Information Morning that the engagement process is outlined by the landowner \u2014 in this case, the province.\n\nZwicker said when it comes to the question of clear cutting, Westfor is following the province's guidelines for management.\n\nWestfor just signed a lease with the province and logging is due to take place over the next two or three years.\n\nThough that lease was signed after the August release of the Independent Review on Forestry Practices \u2014 which recommended, among other things, a reduction in clear cutting \u2014 Zwicker said the new lease does not reflect the conclusions of that report.\n\n\"I think it's because the provincial government hasn't released publicly, or stated publicly, what recommendations they will be implementing or adopting out of the report,\" he said.\n\nZwicker said the management of this forest would potentially be different if the recommendations of the forestry review were in place.\n\nClear cutting decisions 'based on the science'\n\nForestry Minister Iain Rankin said in an interview that while the province isn't able to implement the recommendations of the report \"overnight,\" the report nonetheless identified clearcuts as an appropriate strategy in certain circumstances.\n\n\"There are areas in the forest that will see lighter-touch forestry practices. But we do need to ensure that we have a thriving industry, and areas that aren't appropriate for clearcuts, they won't be clear cut.\"\n\nIn the case of Middle Clyde River, however, Rankin said \"based on the science,\" clear cutting is the best approach.\n\nLands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin said the Independent Review of Forestry Practices still prescribes clear cutting in certain circumstances. (Craig Paisley/CBC)\n\nRankin also said there is an opportunity for the public to comment on clearcuts when the maps for proposed harvests are posted online.\n\nBut Hipson said that process isn't good enough \u2014 and it isn't just commenting on the clearcutting that's difficult.\n\nTalking to students at the local high school, Hipson said it can be hard to answer their questions on what people are doing about clearcutting.\n\n\"They ask, what's happening to the wildlife, what are you doing to protect the songbirds?\" she said. \"You know, children can get it. Why can't we get it as well?\"", "One year after Shepherds of Good of Hope opened a trailer for supervised injections near the ByWard Market, staff say they are accepting twice as many clients as they predicted.\n\nMedical professionals staff the trailer \u2014 located in the Shepherds of Good Hope's parking lot on King Edward Avenue near Murray Street \u2014 to provide clean injection equipment and supervise clients as they ingest the drugs, all in an effort to reduce the risk of overdosing.\n\nThey're also equipped with Narcan, which contains naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote.\n\nLouise Beaudoin, a nurse co-ordinator with Shepherds of Good Hope, said illicit street drugs have only become more dangerous since they opened the trailer.\n\n\"Last year when we had overdoses, we gave two maybe three shots of Narcan.

Debbie Hanlon, the city has not committed to charging drivers who park at broken meters for longer than two hours.\n\n\"I didn't even realize that was said,\" Hanlon, who said the plan was never blanket ticketing for parking at broken or missing meters, told On The Go on Wednesday.\n\nJust two days earlier, Hanlon told CBC News that the city would soon begin ticketing anyone who parked in a space with a missing or broken meter for longer than two hours.\n\n\"If you look out and see all the parking taken up, it's just unfair,\" Hanlon said after Monday's weekly council meeting.\n\n\"I really hope that people have a moral conscience and don't park there.\"\n\nRather, the city wants to bring forward a \"discussion piece\" about how to handle parking at metered spaces before the broken and missing meters are replaced with new ones in 2019.\n\nAfter hearing from a variety of businesses about the problem of drivers parking at spots with out-of-order meters for extended periods of time, even an entire day, the city hopes to remove the broken meters altogether in certain areas and ticket people who park in those spots for longer than two hours, Hanlon said.\n\n\"There would be a two-hour designated parking location, and that was the plan and that's always been the plan,\" she said.\n\n\"It allows for turnover of cars out front of the retail stores.\"\n\nAnd in a statement released by the City of St. John's on Wednesday, quoting Hanlon \u2014 city council's lead on transportation \u2014 the ticketing threat is downplayed and says a solution to address the high numbers of broken meters throughout the city, especially downtown, and ensure parking access has not yet been decided on, or discussed by council.\n\n\"We have a long-term plan to improve paid parking in the city and provide a variety of payment options to our residents,\" said Hanlon in the city's release.\n\n\"The proposed two-hour parking limit in areas with broken meters is in response to requests from downtown business owners to improve parking turnover so that customers visiting downtown have parking availability.\"\n\nPlan discussed in coming weeks\n\nEarlier this year council adopted a five-year management strategy for paid parking in the city, and that plan includes purchasing new parking meters in 2019 to replace the ones downtown.\n\n\"All the things that people are screaming they want, especially if you check social media right now, all that's in the five-year plan,\" Hanlon said Wednesday.\n\n\"This is just a Band-Aid to help the businesses through Christmas.\"\n\nIn the meantime, many of the city's parking meters have been vandalized or have broken, and have not been repaired. The city told CBC News on Tuesday that 54 per cent of the meters in St. John's are currently out of commission.\n\nCoun. Debbie Hanlon, standing, said Monday she hopes the possibility of a ticket keeps people from parking too long at spots with broken meters. On Wednesday, Hanlon's statements downplayed the ticket threat. (Jeremy Eaton/CBC)\n\n\"There's not much we can do about that,\" Hanlon said.\n\n\"We have them now, and they are on our streets, and they are damaged, and we need now to look forward at what we can do.\"\n\nIn a few weeks, council will discuss a plan to address the problem of extended parking at the broken or missing meters, the city's release said, and the public will be made aware of any changes to parking in the affected spaces after that discussion.\n\nHanlon said Monday that signs are up to tell drivers that they could be ticketed for parking for longer than two hours at out-of-commission meters.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide a better parking environment and to support the downtown business community,\" Hanlon said in Wednesday's release.\n\n\"This is not about revenue for the city, it's about supporting small businesses who are the backbone of the downtown economy.\"\n\nBut Hanlon did bring up the problem of lost revenue for the city due to the broken and missing meters with On The Go.\n\n\"We've lost millions of dollars on this,\" she said of the City of St. John's, which said in October it had lost $1.1 million in revenue for parking fees over the past year.\n\n\"People might think that's great I got a free parking spot but it's a tremendous headache, for the city, for the businesspeople, and for the residents. To have all these meters broken and not being used, it's hurting everybody.\"\n\nA variety of options in the plan\n\nThe city's five-year plan for paid parking will incorporate a variety of options, Hanlon said, including new, sturdier meters, paid parking kiosks, parking permits and paid parking spots.\n\nThe city is bringing in several different options to pay for parking in order to accommodate everyone's preferences, she said.\n\n\"We want to take in the familiar as well, we want everybody to be comfortable.\"\n\nAs for retail employees who have said the cost of parking in downtown parking garages is too high, Hanlon said she and Coun. Maggie Burton hope to meet with management of the garages to discuss possible solutions.\n\nBut at the end of the day, Hanlon said, paying for parking is a reality that people in St. John's should expect.\n\n\"We have to look at the fact that the downtown in any city, in anywhere, you have to pay for parking,\" she said.\n\n\"Parking is not free.\"\n\nWith files from Jeremy Eaton\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "A woman holds a sign during a rally in Chicago to inspire voter turnout ahead of the Nov. 6 midterm elections in the United States.

The Crown and defence presented a joint submission for sentencing Wednesday morning at provincial court in St. John's.\n\nWhile awaiting trial for the shooting death of Larry Wellman, Phillips was caught by prison guards hiding a package containing greyish-pink powder behind his back.\n\nHe had picked it up near a fence on the grounds of Her Majesty's Penitentiary on May 26, 2017.\n\nThe cocktail of drugs contained heroin and fentanyl, an powerful opioid that's 25 to 50 times more potent than heroin, the court was told.\n\nHe was also found to be in possession of marijuana. However, the charge was ultimately dropped.\n\nAddiction to opiates\n\nPhillips was found guilty of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Wellman, on Dec. 8, 2017. He was sentenced to life in prison, without chance of parole until 2027.\n\nWellman intervened as a masked Phillips attempted to hold up the Captain's Quarters Hotel bar in St. John's on Oct. 3, 2015. Wellman, a retired firefighter, was shot and later died in hospital.\n\nDuring a sentencing hearing, it was revealed that Phillips had developed an addiction to opiates, and as of that date, had been clean since he relapsed the day he was convicted.\n\nWellman's wife, Linda McBay, who witnessed her husband's traumatic death, sat in the back of the courtroom Wednesday to watch Phillips's sentencing.\n\nJudge Mike Madden accepted a joint submission of 12 months concurrent, but stressed the deadly nature of fentanyl.\n\nMadden added that while it's in the same category as other drugs, \"it's clear fentanyl has the potential to cause more harm than heroin or morphine.\"\n\nAs someone can overdose by simply touching or inhaling fentanyl, it put Phillips, correctional officers, and the prison population, at risk, Madden said.\n\nPhillips's arrest for possession came at a volatile time at Her Majesty's Penitentiary, as fentanyl overdoses swept the St. John's area and eventually made its way into the prison.", "Edmonton's incoming police chief is stressing the importance of diversity and inclusion to help build communities and keep them safe.\n\nDale McFee, who will take over former chief Rod Knecht's job in February, was introduced to Edmonton at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\u200b\"Diversity is a strength,\" said the 53-year-old McFee, who is M\u00e9\u200btis. \"But I want to make sure that we include that diversity isn't just race.

CBC News spoke with two young women Wednesday who said they and their friends were made uncomfortable by the fact that Clement had 'liked' so many of their social media posts over the years.\n\nScheer said he was made aware of an RCMP investigation into the alleged extortion last week and then subsequently met with Clement face-to-face on Monday, when he was \"brought up to speed about what was going on.\"\n\nIt was then mutually decided, Scheer said, that Clement should resign his justice critic role and positions on a number of Commons committees \u2014 including a top secret national security and intelligence committee.\n\nIt is Clement's membership on this special committee in particular that raises red flags for high-level security operatives.\n\nParliamentarians on this committee \u2014 MPs and senators alike \u2014 are privy to the nation's most guarded secrets as they review the work of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Communications Security Establishment, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nScheer said he would leave it to national security agencies to determine if Clement has been compromised as a result of this sexting scandal.\n\n\"I will leave it to them.

Clement said he had shared the images \"over the last three weeks.\"\n\n\"The recipient was, in fact, an individual or party who targeted me for the purpose of financial extortion,\" he wrote.\n\nSources told CBC News that the would-be extortionist asked Clement to pay \u20ac50,000 ($75,200 Cdn) or risk seeing the images and video released publicly.\n\n\"The RCMP are currently investigating the matter to determine the identity of the party responsible for the extortion attempt,\" Clement said.\n\nEarlier today, Scheer did not answer questions about whether Clement can run under the Conservative banner in 2019.\n\n\"I don't have anything further to add to that dynamic, or to anything about \u2026 internal caucus matters, but I think we can all agree that this was a very poor decision,\" he told reporters Wednesday.\n\nWhen asked if Conservative leadership has warned other Tory MPs against this sort of behaviour, Scheer said he shouldn't have to remind elected officials to refrain from obviously inappropriate conduct.\n\n\"I don't know that too many people would have to be told not to share explicit images and videos with people that you haven't met, but obviously this is a terrible decision.\"\n\nThe Parry Sound-Muskoka MP was first elected to the House of Commons in 2006 after making the jump from provincial politics.

This is where things start to get serious.\n\nThe ISU Grand Prix Final takes place in December in Vancouver, where the top six in each discipline qualify to compete.\n\nThe NHK Trophy, taking place this week in Hiroshima, Japan, should see a few more skaters booking their trip to Canada.\n\nYou can watch all the action live on CBCSports.ca beginning Friday at 12:20 a.m. ET.\n\nHere's a look at who to watch in each competition:\n\nIce dance: Papadakis, Cizeron out\n\nBy this point in the Grand Prix circuit, we have pretty much seen all of the key players, with the exception of the 2018 Olympic ice dance silver medallists, Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron.\n\nTo say these two have been keeping a low profile would be an understatement. According to sources, they enjoyed a long break after what was an exhausting season and didn't really put their skates back on in earnest until August. They have yet to publicly preview their free dance, and when they skated their rhythm dance at the French Masters event, filming was forbidden.\n\nPapadakis and Cizeron are such a talented team that I believe that they could show up on competition day after a long break and still win. Sadly, we won't get that chance at NHK Trophy.\n\nTheir agent, David Baden, told CBC Sports on Tuesday that Cizeron suffered \"a minor back injury last Wednesday when he was on ice practising\" with Papadakis.\n\n\"The injury is considered minor and he is expected to be back on the ice as of today,\" Baden added. \"The decision to withdraw was at the recommendation of his medical and coaching teams.

That is one of the questions on my mind.\n\nWomen: 'Tiny Queen' vs. 'The Empress'\n\nThe women's competition is a battle royale \u2014 or should I say royal? The fans, with great affection, refer to Japan's Satoko Miyahara as the \"Tiny Queen\" and Russia's Elizaveta Tuktamysheva as \"The Empress\".\n\nBoth women have one Grand Prix title apiece this season and are looking for their second. Frankly? It's a toss up.\n\nTuktamysheva's gorgeous triple Axel jump in her short program could give her a momentary edge, but if Miyahara skates like she did at Skate America, she would be the woman to beat.\n\nMiyahara posted a total combined score of 219.71 to win the Ladies title at Skate America in Everett, Washington. 7:57\n\nIt could all go sidewise if Grand Prix debutante Rika Kihira of Japan does what she is capable of as the first woman to land a triple Axel/triple toe combination in competition, which she did at the Junior Grand Prix Final in December 2017.\n\nDon't let her status as reigning Japanese junior champion fool you.

While many have shared their experiences of breaking the cycle of abuse and trauma, not all are success stories. Many, like Thrasher, wind up in the criminal justice system or battling addictions.\n\nThrasher's name is familiar to some in the N.W.T. for his lengthy criminal record, including convictions for assaults, property crimes and theft.\n\nPerhaps most well-known is his conviction in 2011 for stabbing a woman's dog to death.

Something that might have incapacitated Goodridge.\n\n\"But since then,\" Holloway said, \"I've come to the realization there were only two outcomes. If I had attacked Daniel, either I would have died or he would have died. There was nothing in between. So I would have either died or I would have had the guilt of taking another life on my hands.

He envisions a fully paperless office, like he became accustomed to working in the private sector.\n\n\"Most board meetings that I've ever been involved with don't have any paper.\"", "CBC News is taking an in depth look at B.C.'s electoral reform referendum this week\n\nIn B.C.'s electoral reform referendum, people will be asked to rank three different systems of proportional representation:\n\nMixed member is a system used in countries throughout the world, and it derives its name from the mix of how politicians are chosen: some directly in ridings, others through a system that gives each party a certain number of MLAs based on an overall total of votes.\n\nHere's a summary of how it works and what would change for voters.\n\nIn one sentence\n\nMixed member proportional lets people directly pick their local representative but creates a second layer of MLAs that are chosen based on the percentage of votes parties receive in different regions of B.C.\n\nWhat would the ballot look like?\n\nPeople would have a list of candidates in their riding and choose one, same as currently.\n\nPeople would have a list of candidates in their riding and choose one, same as currently. (CBC)\n\nThere could also be a second voting option on the ballot, to choose the second layer of MLAs, but that will be decided after the referendum by an all-party committee.\n\n\"It creates two types of representatives. One who is chosen by voters, much as we currently do within a given riding, and others that are chosen from larger aggregated districts,\" said UBC political scientist Max Cameron, who gave advice to Attorney General David Eby during the province's consultation process.\n\nHow would MLAs be determined?\n\nFor the first layer of MLAs, the candidate with the most votes in each riding is elected, keeping the current first-past-the-post system (although the ridings will be larger).\n\nFor the second layer of MLAs, in each region of the province another group would be appointed, based on the percentage of the vote each party received in that region.\n\nFor the first layer of MLAs, the candidate with the most votes in each riding is elected. For the second layer of MLAs in each region of the province, another group would be appointed, based on the percentage of the vote each party received in that region. (CBC)\n\nAs an example, in the Okanagan, there are currently seven MLAs elected in seven ridings. With mixed member proportional, you could have four MLAs chosen in individual ridings and four list PR MLAs determined by overall vote percentages in the region.\n\nSo, if the NDP won none of the four Okanagan seats but received 25 per cent of the total vote in the Okanagan (as happened last election), they could receive two of the second layer MLAs.\n\nWhat are the advantages of this system?\n\n\"MMP in some ways is, I wouldn't say the least risky, but the other two systems haven't been tried,\" said Cameron.\n\nThe system is used in several places, including Germany, New Zealand, and the regional legislatures for Scotland and Wales.\n\nAnd it enables smaller parties with enough support to garner representation they wouldn't get under different systems.\n\n\"What you get is a combination, really, of first-past-the-post with a more proportional system. It's not perfectly proportional, but it's better than first-past-the-post,\" said Cameron.\n\nWhat could be the disadvantages?\n\nOver 60 per cent of the MLAs would still be determined under first-past-the-post rules, so if people prefer a PR system with a greater mix of representation, this system is the weakest of the three.\n\nAlso, like the other two PR systems under consideration, B.C. would likely have minority governments most of the time, which critics argue would lead to private deals made between parties to determine who holds power, and could lead to extremist parties holding the balance of power.\n\nBut Cameron says coalitions are not always negative.\n\n\"You get a tradition of coalition making. People understand that you vote, you get a legislature, the legislature than sits down, and then there's a process of negotiation \u2026 that gives you the confidence to govern. And that's a very normal party of democracy,\" he said.\n\nWould the size of my riding change?\n\nThe size of ridings would generally increase by 50 to 100 per cent.\n\nThe size of ridings would generally increase by 50 to 100 per cent. This is because, the province says, at least 60 per cent of MLAs would still be elected in individual ridings and the total number of MLAs would be no more than 95. (CBC)\n\nThis is because, the province says, at least 60 per cent of MLAs would still be elected in individual ridings and the total number of MLAs would be no more than 95.\n\nThe exact boundaries of the ridings would be determined later by an independent commission.\n\nCould smaller parties and independents get elected?\n\nYes, if the party is able to garner at least five per cent of the provincewide vote.\n\nIndependents could still get elected in the individual ridings.\n\nWhat would be determined after the referendum?\n\nIn short: a lot.\n\nIf chosen, exactly how an MMP system would work in B.C. would have to be determined after the election by an all-party committee. (CBC)\n\nLike the other two systems on the ballot, an all-party legislative committee would decide the total number of MLAs, with a maximum of 95 in total.\n\nAn independent electoral boundaries commission would then have to create the province's new electoral map.\n\nBut the all-party committee would have to decide whether people will vote once (for individual candidates) or twice (once for individual candidates and once for specific parties to decide the second layer of MLAs).\n\n\"There are many different ways of organizing MMP, and, so, there are some issues that I wish were clarified, I think, before we go to the referendum,\" said Cameron.\n\nCBC Vancouver will have special coverage of the debate between B.C.

Blair Lawrence on Monday said he wants the province to look at that.\n\n\"Whether or not that's a political regionalization, we need to think more and more about economic regionalization,\" Lawrence said. \"At every step of the way, when there's an opportunity, the regions need to get together.\"\n\nUnsaid, though, was the contentious 'a' word: amalgamation.\n\nAdam Lordon, Miramichi mayor and president of the Cities of New Brunswick Association, says the group wants the province to look at how people who live outside municipal boundaries could help pay for the services they use in urban areas.

The posters also were reported to Winnipeg police and police have said they're looking into it.\n\n\"The focus is always on ensuring safety and a respectful environment rather than engaging directly with provocations,\" the university said in a statement earlier this week.\n\nFaxes with the same phrase were sent to offices around the campus, including the women's and gender studies program.\n\nThe same messages were found posted in many cities across Canada. University of Manitoba president David Barnard said the posters are part of \"a co-ordinated international effort by neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.\"\n\nThe posters also appeared on North American campuses in November 2017, including the University of Regina, Washington State University, the University of California in Berkeley and Concordia College in Moorhead, Minn.\n\n\"It just goes to show that racism isn't only something that elders are upholding. It's the younger generation as well, and we have to be vigilant of that,\" Theis said.\n\n'Hard to get to class'\n\nShayla Seymour-Hourie said being an Indigenous student can be lonely.\n\n\"I feel deeply when things happen to any one of us, whether it's racism in class or, you know, like feeling excluded on campus,\" Seymour-Hourie said.\n\n\"Sometimes it's just hard to get to class when you know it's going to be a discussion about who you are, like you're not even there.

The organization also wants the CRTC to revisit an impending rule it says will prevent small players from offering high-speed internet service \u2014 above 100 megabits per second \u2014 on non-fibre networks.\n\n\"That just means higher prices and less choice. That's the fundamental issue,\" said CNOC chair Matt Stein, who is also CEO of Distributel.\n\nThe CRTC said it can't comment on an open case.\n\nFibre access, please\n\nCanada is home to hundreds of independent internet companies. The CRTC allows them to rent network access from major telcos such as Bell, Rogers, Telus and Shaw and resell the service to Canadians at competitive prices.\n\nIn 2015, the CRTC mandated that Canada's major players also had to share their highest-speed fibre optic networks with their smaller competitors.\n\nBut Stein says the way the rules are written, the smaller providers still can't gain access, leaving the big players to dominate the fibre market.\n\n\"It's just completely unreasonable,\" Stein said.\n\nFibre optic cables are able to transmit far more data than conventional internet service provided via copper wiring.\n\nOpening up fibre lines to smaller competitors sparked concerns among the major telcos, who invest big money in the technology.\n\nIn an effort to push the smaller competitors to also make infrastructure investments, the CRTC mandated that they had to take the extra step of creating their own connection points to neighbourhoods when accessing big telcos' fibre networks.\n\nStein argues the requirement creates a barrier because it's far too costly and time consuming for smaller players to implement.\n\n\"It's almost designed to be impossible,\" he said. \"It really fundamentally undoes the benefits of the whole decision in the first place.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the CRTC denied a request by CNOC to allow independent providers unconditional access to fibre networks until the regulator could re-evaluate the current rules.\n\nOpen Media's Laura Tribe argues smaller internet providers can make a fair trade by paying the big telcos like Bell, Rogers and Telus for fibre optic access. (CBC)\n\nTelco watchdog Laura Tribe argues that even if independent players can't afford to invest in the infrastructure, they will still pay the big telcos for fibre access.\n\n\"They actually pay to access those services,\" said Tribe, executive director of Vancouver-based Open Media. \"These independent providers aren't getting a free ride.\"\n\nCBC News received an advanced copy of CNOC's report before it was submitted on Wednesday. Bell, Rogers and Shaw \u2014 which had not yet seen it \u2014 all declined to comment on Tuesday. Telus said CRTC regulations need to support infrastructure investment.\n\n\"Meeting Canadians' rapidly increasing demand for more Internet bandwidth will require sustained multibillion-dollar capital investments over many years,\" spokesperson Richard Gilhooley said in an email.\n\nCondo connections\n\nOntario-based internet provider Eyesurf says because it can't simply piggy-back on big telcos' fibre optic networks, it's shut out of many new condos that are only wired with fibre-based internet access.\n\n\"It's a difficult situation,\" said co-founder Randy Jheeta. \"It goes against what was originally intended for deregulation, which was to open the market for independent providers.\"\n\nLast month, Heather Kerr moved into a new condo in Kitchener, Ont. She planned to sign up with Eyesurf, believing the company offered the best rates.\n\nBut she quickly found out that wasn't possible because her building was wired only with fibre access.\n\n\"I was really upset,\" she said. \"It was supposed to [be a] beautiful free market in Canada but it's all monopolies.\"\n\n100 Mbps showdown\n\nCNOC is also concerned about a pending rule where small providers using the current model of accessing big telcos' networks \u2014 without investing in multiple connection points \u2014 will have their internet speed capped at 100 megabits per second.\n\nStein said the rule threatens to crush the competition, as Canadians increasingly expect ultra-fast internet service. According to CRTC data, customers requesting 100 megabits per second or higher nearly doubled from eight per cent in 2015 to almost 15.8 per cent in 2016.\n\n\"You end up in a situation where independent internet providers can no longer offer the services that Canadians want,\" Stein said.\n\nStein said the 100 Mbps rule could come into effect within six months unless the CRTC revises its regulations.\n\nCNOC's submission comes shortly before a Nov. 16 CRTC deadline for internet providers to comment on finalizing wholesale rates charged by the big telcos for access to their fibre networks.", "Meal trains. A Google group. Dog walking. An annual street party.\n\nThose are the kinds of experiences neighbours share with each other on Helena Avenue, a tree-lined street in midtown Toronto.\n\nChandra Sookdeosingh, who's been living there for 15 years, says neighbours' unique bond goes beyond social gatherings. After falling ill one day around a decade ago, she felt comfortable enough to walk right through the front door of her long-time neighbour Suzanne Schwenger's home.\n\n\"She actually took me in the ambulance to the hospital and stayed there with me until a relative came to see me,\" Sookdeosingh recalls.\n\n\"I think that is what part of being in a neighbourhood like this is all about: You feel a sense of belonging. You feel people are looking out for you.\"\n\nBut in Toronto, this kind of neighbour-to-neighbour connection is more a rarity than the norm. A first-of-its-kind survey released this week by the Toronto Foundation, which explores the relationships of Toronto residents, reveals 66 per cent of people report only knowing a few \u2014 or none \u2014 of their neighbours.\n\nIt's a situation researchers say is increasingly common across North America, but that doesn't mean it's a good thing: Knowing neighbours, according to sociologists, can be beneficial to people's health and wellbeing, and to communities as a whole.\n\n1 in 10 residents don't know any neighbours\n\nOnly nine per cent of Toronto residents report knowing most of their neighbours, the Toronto Foundation's survey results show. Another quarter say they know many, while nearly 60 per cent know a few.\n\nAnother finding? Nearly one in 10 residents say they don't know a single person living around them.\n\n\"Knowing one's neighbours is not closely linked to household income, education, generation in Canada or neighbourhood area, but is more likely among those who live in detached dwellings (versus high-rise buildings) and who have spent more years living in the same neighbourhood,\" the report notes.\n\nHelena Avenue, perhaps the poster-child for a tight-knit Toronto neighbourhood, fits that bill. The quaint 450-metre stretch just south of St. Clair Avenue West, which runs between Wychwood Barns Park and Bathurst Street, is largely semis and detached houses. There's also a large population of long-term residents, with many living on the street for a decade or two \u2014 or more.\n\nWhen John Smith first moved to the street 16 years ago, he quickly met neighbours on both sides of his home. After growing up on a north Toronto street where residents never spoke \u2014 unless it was through their lawyers to settle some beef, he jokes \u2014 Smith was surprised, and quickly embraced it.\n\n\"It makes it a much more enjoyable, social community,\" he says, standing on the leaf-covered sidewalk near his home.\n\nIt's also intentional, with residents stepping up to host an annual street party and checking in on each other in times of need, residents say.\n\n\"This street has done an amazing job of rallying energy and interest, and changing with the community,\" echoes Cynthia Dann-Beardsley, a 32-year resident who started off as one of the neighbourhood's \"new moms,\" and is now a grandmother.\n\nLauren Pelley asks Toronto residents if they know people living around them. 1:01\n\n'We need to belong'\n\nKnowing one's neighbours, according to the team behind the Toronto Foundation's survey, is one of the most significant factors impacting who does and doesn't have higher levels of social capital \u2014 or in other words, robust relationship networks and social support.\n\n\"Civic connection is most evident among citizens who know their neighbours,\" notes the report, released on Monday.\n\nOutside experts also stress the clear health and wellness benefits of building ties with people living nearby. Social bonds, in fact, are the \"strongest predictor\" of a long, healthy life, according to Montreal-based psychologist Susan Pinker.\n\n\"We are social animals, and we need to belong,\" continues Pinker, whose book The Village Effect: Why Face-to-Face Contact Matters came out in 2014.\n\n\"It's as important to our biological survival as other needs like eating, drinking and sleeping ... Loneliness and social isolation leave a special mark, an imprint, on every cell of our bodies.\"\n\nResearch from the University of Missouri-Columbia, for instance, shows a correlation between neighbourhood relationships and health. Even while taking into account factors such as someone's level of education, income, and age, people who reported that \"their neighbours can be trusted\" reported better health on average, the 2011 study found.\n\nBeryl-Ann Mark, a 24-year Parkdale resident, began spending time with other neighbours at the local library on Queen Street West several years ago. 'It helps my overall well-being,' she says. (Lauren Pelley/CBC News)\n\n\"People who get together to play cards or be in a book club or play old-timers hockey have a much higher likelihood of avoiding dementia,\" adds Pinker.\n\nResearchers say it's also beneficial for people's resiliency and day-to-day mental health. When you know your neighbours, \"you know that you're in a caring place where you have a stronger sense of belonging,\" says Cheryl Teelucksingh, a sociologist at Ryerson University.\n\nThat rings true for Beryl-Ann Mark, a 24-year Parkdale resident who began spending time with other neighbourhood residents at the local library on Queen Street West several years ago.\n\nThe local moms getting together after picking up their children from school has become a daily ritual, she says. The women help their kids with homework some days, and share meals on others.\n\n\"It helps my overall wellbeing, and my mental state of mind,\" Mark says with a laugh. \"Dealing with family, household chores, work \u2014 it can be fairly stressful. Gathering with neighbourhood friends is really important for me.\"\n\nDigital communication playing a role\n\nSince the benefits are clear, why don't more people embrace neighbourhood connections in Toronto?\n\nMarc J. Dunkelman, a fellow at Brown University's Taubman Center for Public Policy, says it's a sign of the times across North America, thanks to the rise of digital communication.\n\n\"We've got more opportunities now than ever to touch people who, in previous generations, were mostly untouchable,\" says Dunkelman, author of The Vanishing Neighbour: The Transformation of American Community\u200b.\n\nAnd he doesn't mean celebrities on social media. Think of decades past, when a spouse would leave the house and their partner didn't hear from them until they reunited for dinner. Now, you can text, call or FaceTime your loved ones any time you want. Why invest in neighbours, some might say, when your closest connections are a click away?\n\n\"It used to be, if we didn't have good relationships with our neighbours, we'd be dead,\" says Pinker. \"Our farms would burn down.\"\n\nHow well do you know your neighbours, or your co-workers? Do you have friends or family nearby, or people who can help out in a pinch? How you answer these questions can say a lot about your health and wellbeing. Sharon Avery, President and CEO of the Toronto Foundation, speaks about its first-ever study on social capital. 7:57\n\nNow, we don't need to build relationships with a lot of once-upon-a-time connections. Bank tellers have given way to online banking; bookstore clerks were largely phased out by online shopping.\n\nBut researchers say that doesn't mean people should give up those real-world relationships with other community members \u2014 including those just a door-knock away.\n\n\"The next time you do have an opportunity, and you're either going out to your car and you see somebody else going to their car next door, or you're in that elevator, just start up a conversation,\" Teelucksingh says.\n\n\"Introduce yourself.

My dad was a practising Muslim. My mom is a practising Christian. I go to church regularly on Sundays and also attend mosque from time to time. My parents always thought I was doubly blessed.\n\nPerhaps that is why I strive to ensure that all my students are open-minded, well-rounded critical thinkers.\n\nHigh school teacher Sabrina Jafralie has a tattoo on her forearm of a hamza, a Middle Eastern talisman recognized in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. (Submitted by Sabrina Jafralie) And yet, the CAQ would like to reduce my teaching career to two symbols that I wear: a tasbeeh (Muslim prayer beads) and my tattoo of a hamza (or Hand of Fatima), a Middle Eastern talisman recognized in Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\n\nIn 2013, when Pauline Marois proposed the \"Charter of Values\" (Bill 60), I had an overwhelming need to speak out against it. I clearly committed to protesting against a bill that discriminated against me and my colleagues.\n\nAfter the bill died on the order paper following an election call in 2014, I thought, perhaps naively, that this type of bill would not resurface in a pluralistic Quebec. Yet, four years later, I find myself in the same position \u2014 protesting to protect the fundamental rights of members of my school community.\n\nThe CAQ's proposal to ban religious symbols for some civil servants is problematic for several reasons.\n\nErasing cultural diversity?\n\nFirst, the CAQ deems the crucifix a heritage symbol. However, this in no way erases its religious symbolism for millions of Catholics around the world and in Quebec.\n\nThe crucifix does not lose its religious meaning simply because it is also part of our province's heritage.\n\nThe very fact that it remains in the National Assembly shows hypocrisy and, even more so, begs the question: is this an attempt to further rewrite Quebec's history and reduce the contributions of others such as Indigenous peoples, Jews, Muslims and Sikhs?\n\nThis argument smells like a revisionist attempt to erase the cultural diversity that has made Quebec society what it is.\n\nAdditionally, why is it acceptable to single out religions whose adherents wear head coverings? Why should a suit-wearing evangelical Christian have the opportunity to be a judge, a police officer or a teacher, but not a Sikh whose turban symbolizes a commitment to the poor and the oppressed?\n\nSabrina Jafralie says having a tattoo of a religious symbol on her arm has no bearing on her ability to teach. (Submitted by Sabrina Jafralie) This proposed ban singles out those religions that happen to require some form of outward expression. These are not the actions of a neutral state but rather one that has clearly lost touch with its own democratic and inclusive values.\n\nAs the leader of the province whose population represents the largest linguistic minority in Canada, one would think that this point would not be lost on Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault.\n\nApparently understanding the basics of a high school civics course is not a criterion for becoming premier.\n\nLet me be absolutely clear that I do not agree with any teacher using their classroom to proselytize, whether it is for religious or non-religious purposes.\n\nThat being said, it is impossible for any teacher to be perfectly neutral. The problem is not that teachers have views; it only becomes a problem if teachers use their power to impose their views in a way that hinders the free exploration of ideas and critical thinking.\n\nSabrina Jafralie was raised in an inter-faith home. She goes to church on Sundays and wears a tasbeeh, Muslim prayer beads, on her wrist. (Submitted by Sabrina Jafralie) To trust all teachers to be professional in their interactions with students, except those who happen to wear religious symbols, is hypocritical and discriminatory.\n\nIf the CAQ would like to force me into an impossible choice \u2014 my faith or my career \u2014 frankly, I would not make that choice.\n\nI would continue to be a teacher and a religious believer.\n\nTo hide one's identity, whether religious or otherwise, is inauthentic. It does not allow teachers to build meaningful relationships based on trust, openness and respect with their students.\n\nI will say one last thing to the CAQ and its members: if you would like training to improve your civic religious literacy, I am a co-founding director of the Centre for Civic Religious Literacy and would be happy to help.\n\nThis column is an opinion piece.

It was an important victory for Democrats no matter how Donald Trump spins it. They have power in Washington again and that will have real consequences for him.\n\nThe Democrats intend to do what the Republicans wouldn't \u2014 investigate the president.\n\n\"He's going to learn that he's not above the law,\" Rep. Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, said on CNN shortly after the midterm results were clear.\n\nThe first step reportedly will be to get his tax returns. The House ways and means committee will ask for them. If, as is likely, the request is refused, the committee will demand them, and that demand seems inevitably headed toward the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump supporter and former House speaker Newt Gingrich has already anticipated this, saying a Supreme Court case on whether Trump must release his tax returns will be a test of whether the bitter fight over the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the top court was worth it.\n\nAn extraordinarily candid statement, to put it gently.\n\nDemocratic supporters cheer the election results at the Hyatt Regency in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.

He said his body \"rag-dolled\" into the woods, where his head struck a tree branch and his back hit a rock. His passenger was unscathed.\n\nKenyon broke seven vertebrae, three in his neck, and four in his lower back, an injury he believes was aggravated by his pre-existing arthritis. But Kenyon credits his helmet for saving his mind.\n\n\"I would have had mental issues. I'm sure I would have banged up my head and given my brain a shake,\" he said. \"Helmets are super important.\"\n\nThat conclusion is borne out by CBC's analysis, which shows that in 20 percent of ATV fatalities, riders were not wearing helmets.\n\nKenyon riding his ATV before his accident.

Nova Scotia and New Brunswick require insurance, but in Newfoundland and Labrador it's only necessary if you cross a highway on your vehicle. Insurance is not required on Prince Edward Island.\n\nKenyon said he knows that even when rules are in place, they are often ignored.\n\n\"I know a lot of people with ATVs, they forgo insurance.

First he regained the use of his hands, eventually learning to tie fishing flies as his self-assigned final project.\n\nThen Kenyon's efforts turned to standing, and then walking, which he can accomplish now with the help of crutches and leg braces.\n\nHis goal: To resume his life before the accident, including a return to his off-the-grid trailer in the woods of Lake Midway on Digby Neck.\n\n\"I could do the comfort of living in a nice apartment, have things easy. But I feel more at home when I'm smelling the salt air and I'm in the woods, and that feels like home to me,\" he said.\n\nMcLeod said that goal has been driving his progress.\n\n\"He just really wants to get back in the woods.

And I'm sure he'd be extra cautious now. But it's admirable to get back on the horse. But with caution.\"\n\n\"I didn't turn into a piece of china, right?\" Kenyon said. \"A hard piece of wood, probably.\"\n\n\"You know I still love the woods, I still love the trails, I still love developing my property and clearing and hauling wood.

But a pill is a different story, he said.\n\n\"If you have a pill under your tongue, all you do is you reach in, grab the pill, pull it out. And so you have an instant ability to divert the medication,\" Bainbridge said.\n\nHealth-care practitioners are already \"being asked to do a lot\" to prevent the abuse of narcotics, including locking them up in hospitals and monitoring who has access to them, he said, questioning whether the limited clinical use of a sufentanil pill would be worth the potential problems it could create.\n\n\"Do we have a real need for this sort of medication in practice in Canada?\" Bainbridge asked. \"From reading the literature, [I] don't see it as a big benefit.\"\n\nIn contrast, the \"abuse potential\" is a big concern, he said, especially because sufentanil is so potent: It takes only a \"few grains of powder\" to have an effect.\n\n\"[It's] yet another narcotic that people aren't familiar with that, if it makes its way to the street, may result in even more people suffering from overdoses and dying,\" he said.\n\nDr. Hance Clarke, medical director of the pain research unit at Toronto General Hospital, agreed that the risks versus the benefits of a sufentanil pill need to be fully assessed.\n\nA pill form of sufentanil could be useful to alleviate pain for wounded soldiers in battlefield conditions, but the benefit in hospital settings is questionable, says Dr. Hance Clarke. (University Health Network)\n\nClarke said he would support its use with injured soldiers in a battlefield situation, as the Pentagon has proposed in the U.S., because it \"could help to alleviate suffering after critical wounds.\"\n\nBut apart from that, he said he could only see \"a handful of scenarios\" in which sufentanil couldn't otherwise be readily administered through an IV.\n\n\"Bringing this to Canada, and for use in the hospital system, should very much be questioned,\" Clarke said in a email. \"From a societal/harm reduction perspective, the potential for abuse is significant.\"\n\nDsuvia is expected to be available in the U.S. in early 2019.

Meister, travelling alone, was just 19. The oldest of five children, her parents had pulled together just enough money to buy her a berth aboard the ship.\n\nAnnette Wildgoose's mother, who was born Alice Meister, settled in Scotland after she and hundreds of other Jewish passengers aboard the MS St. Louis were refused entry to Canada in 1939. Most of the ship's occupants died in the Holocaust after being sent back to other European countries. 1:08\n\n\"Most Jewish families, if they had financial [means], could get one child out of Germany at the time,\" Wildgoose said.\n\nThe ship was repeatedly turned away, first from Cuba, then the United States, and eventually Halifax, where Canadian immigration officials employed the now infamous \"none is too many\" policy toward Jewish refugees.\n\nThe ship returned to Europe.

Yes, the Games would physically be contested in Calgary, but it is something that the entire country could celebrate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Calgarians will have a chance to decide if they think hosting the Olympics is a good idea. But we thought it would be a good idea to give the whole country an (unofficial) say.\n\nHere are some facts to help familiarize yourself with the pros and cons of each side, and then you can vote in our poll at the bottom of the story asking whether you think Calgary should host the 2026 Olympics.\n\nLet the real campaign begin\n\nAfter last week's contentious city council meeting that pushed Calgary's potential Olympic bid to the brink, it's time to vote.\n\nThe city will hold a non-binding plebiscite (basically another name for a referendum) on Nov. 13, and the question for Calgarians will be simple: Are you for or are you against Calgary hosting the 2026 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games?\n\nResidents will have two choices: \"I am for Calgary hosting\" or \"I am against Calgary hosting.\"\n\nThe vote is technically nonbinding, but will undoubtedly guide what happens next. And if the city council vote is any indication, it will be close.\n\nWatch a quick explainer on the Calgary plebiscite:\n\nCBC Sports' Anson Henry breaks down the referendum facing Calgary voters. 1:20\n\nSome things to consider\n\nDo we know enough about how much it would cost?\n\nThe process of bidding for an Olympics is usually an opaque one. Taxpayers who will actually pay the bill for the Games are usually told very little, only to be left with a massive bill after the party leaves town. Details about the Games are hashed out by unknown sportocrats in plush European hotels.\n\nBy this standard, Calgary's potential bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics has been quite transparent. Maybe a little too transparent.\n\nIn terms of public money needed, organizers have pegged the figure at nearly $3 billion. The breakdown would be nearly $1.5 billion from Ottawa. Calgary taxpayers are being asked to pitch in $370 million, while the province of Alberta would kick in $700 million.\n\nCan these numbers be trusted?\n\nThese numbers are part of a proposed budget that has been put together more than eight years ahead of the Olympics. Even on the floor of Calgary council, there was widespread confusion about how these figures were arrived at and what exactly was covered.\n\nFor example, the budget was trimmed by $150 million after the RCMP found efficiencies in its initial security plan. Remember, it was RCMP officials, among others, that grossly underestimated the security costs associated with the Vancouver Olympics. The security budget is now pegged at $610 million. In Vancouver, the final bill came in at $900 million.\n\nAt the same time, bid supporters have said that the city would see a healthy return on any investment \u2014 and then some.\n\nOn the Calgary 2026 website, readers are told: \"The City of Calgary would need to invest $390 million and for every dollar Calgary invests, it would get $10 in return.\"\n\nThe 'No Calgary Olympics' side asks citizens to consider how this money could be better spent. The group makes a number of suggestions, which include public housing and environmental protection.\n\nWhat are we getting?\n\nA major selling point of Olympic bids is usually the windfall of infrastructure that accompanies any winning bid.\n\nIt was initially hoped that a rail link to the airport, an expanded highway and a much-needed new NHL-size arena would be central to the Calgary bid.\n\nBut in a effort to make this bid financially prudent, many of these infrastructure enticements are now off the table.\n\nThe IOC actually has encouraged potential bidders to focus on refurbishing and rehabbing existing venues in an effort to curtail costs. There are no plans for an NHL-size arena or a rail link to the airport. Instead, the plan calls for 11 existing venues to be refurbished and only two new venues to be built.\n\nIs it worth it?\n\nIf you love the thrill of the Olympic Games and take great national pride in success and medals, then an Olympic bid is an easy yes \u2014 no matter what part of the country you live in. If you think it's important to have a hub of world-class facilities for our elite athletes in Calgary, then it's an easy yes.\n\nFrom the Calgary 2026 website: \"This is not a nostalgia exercise. We believe that it's a fundamental privilege to ask big questions about the future of our city. To imagine what's possible and to consider how, by hosting the 2026 Games, we can work together to realize many of our current community needs and priorities.\"\n\nOthers see it quite differently. Groups such as 'No Olympics Calgary' have consistently painted this as a project Calgary doesn't need.\n\nFrom its website: \"There are many reasons to be concerned about being a host city. And these concerns are distinct from whether a person supports the Olympics and sport. The IOC has structured a bid process and then a host city relationship that puts undue risk on that host city. There is a reason that every Olympics has had cost overruns. Finally, for Calgary in 2018, it's not clear that hosting the IOC for three weeks in 2026 is the right goal at the right time.\"\n\nTime for you to have your say.

Kemp accused Democrats on Sunday of trying to hack voter registration systems, without offering any supporting evidence. Democratic party officials, who have accused Kemp of trying to suppress the minority vote, quickly denied the charge.\n\nA nonprofit group, Protect Democracy, said it had filed an emergency lawsuit on Tuesday asking a federal judge to block Kemp from presiding over the election results, including any recount or runoff race.\n\nThe races in Florida and Georgia were seen as a test of whether liberal candidates could prevail in Southern states, where centrist Democrats have repeatedly lost, by appealing to a coalition of young and minority voters.\n\nAccusations of race-baiting have dogged Kemp, 55, and DeSantis, 40.

North Dakota voters decided recreational pot wasn't for them, while voters in Missouri passed one of three unrelated measures to legalize medical marijuana. Utah voters also were considering whether to allow medical marijuana and to join the 31 other states that have already done so.\n\nIncluding Michigan, 10 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. But the passage in Michigan gives it a foothold in Middle America and could cause tension with neighbouring Indiana and Ohio, which overwhelmingly rejected a 2015 legalization measure.\n\nMichigan voted to legalize recreational marijuana, becoming the first Midwestern state to do so.

The same framework was used to assess the 2010 Vancouver Games.\n\nMayor Naheed Nenshi said while the analysis was \"narrow,\" it shows the Games are positive for Calgary.\n\n\"The report says by and large the benefits would far outweigh the costs,\" he said following the assessment committee meeting.\n\nNet cost: government spending\n\nThe report found there would be an estimated net cost of between $65 and $575 million spent by the provincial and federal governments.\n\nIt weighed both projected capital and operating expenditures against estimated revenues, but didn't include contributions from the City of Calgary and Town of Canmore.\n\nThe exclusion is because the local monetary contribution will be spent in the region regardless of whether or not the Games go ahead.\n\nHowever, the projected money from provincial and federal governments may not end up in Calgary unless the city hosts the Games.\n\nNet benefit: residential consumers\n\nThe report predicted there would be a $230-million to $570-million benefit to locals in 2018 dollars, and also benefits like increased happiness, enjoyment of the games and new venues, which can't be quantified.\n\nHowever, it said there could also be dissatisfaction if there are disruptions caused by construction in advance of the Games.\n\nThe researchers based these estimates on interviews done after the 2012 Summer Games in London.\n\nThe report found benefits for residents, economic growth and social outcomes, but negatives for government finances and the environment. (Ernst & Young)\n\nNet cost: the environment\n\nThe Games would have a low-to-medium impact on the environment, the report found.\n\nDespite a pitch for a less extravagant version of the Games, it will be hard to mitigate the increased carbon emissions and waste generated.\n\nNet benefit: economic development\n\nErnst & Young predicted there could be higher GDP, job creation, tax revenue, increased tourism and branding for the city, all positives for Calgary if the city hosts the Games.\n\nHowever, the company was not able tp provide a number figure for what it could mean for Calgary's economy, as it didn't have enough time.\n\nThe firm had just about a month to put together a report instead of its usual four to six month timeline, meaning it was a bit \"rushed,\" the committee was told.\n\nNet benefit: social outcomes\n\nThe report found there was a low net positive for social outcomes to the city, like increased affordable housing, health benefits from increased participation in sports and promotion of volunteerism.\n\nBut it said there could also be some costs, like people displaced due to construction and a lack of inclusiveness in the Games itself.\n\nUpshot of the EY cost benefit analysis. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/yyccc?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#yyccc</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/q3Yqhi8DOD\">pic.twitter.com/q3Yqhi8DOD</a> \u2014@CBCScott\n\nThe company stressed that the analysis isn't meant to calculate a definitive return on investment number, but rather provide a framework for people to understand the different trade-offs in a project of this scope.\n\n\"One person might value the financial costs more than increased affordable housing, while another person might feel that civic pride is an important factor in their decision making process,\" said Kent Kaufield, managing partner with Ernst & Young.\n\n\"The weighting of each of these accounts is personal.\"\n\nCoun.

He says the documents are 'things that I am entitled to as a right \u2014 not things that I should have to fight for.' (Jaison Empson/CBC)\n\nZazelenchuk says from the people he spoke to, he understands the hack at NRC was a \"voyeuristic intrusion and not a destructive intrusion.\"\n\nIn other words, the hackers looked at, but didn't destroy, the NRC's database and the information should have been retrievable by the government of Canada's \"largest research organization.\"\n\nZazelenchuk said in court Tuesday that the excuse for the tepid flow of documents brought to mind a childhood phrase.\n\n\"Something I used in Grade 7 \u2014 'the dog ate my homework.' It's just a silly excuse,\" Zazelenchuk\u200b.\n\nHe was in court hoping Justice Greenberg would would order NRC and BCC to pay costs for years of legal work \u2014 with little to show for it, he says.\n\nZazelenchuk\u200b argued that untimely release of documents essentially forced him to start over, after already putting more than a hundred hours of legal work into the case and his client having spent thousands of dollars on a previous lawyer's efforts.\n\nHe filed a motion arguing he and his clients weren't getting what they wanted from the National Research Council and its affiliate, Biomedical Commercialization Canada.\n\n\"I had to do something. These are things that I am entitled to as a right. Not things that I should have to fight for.\u2026 I'm entitled to complete frank disclosure and I didn't get it,\" Zazelenchuk told CBC.\n\n'Matter of national security'\n\nDhara Drew, the lawyer acting on behalf of the NRC and BCC, offered little in the way of explanation or evidence in court of a connection between the slow pace of disclosing documents and the 2014 cyber intrusion, saying \"all of those details are a matter of national security.\"\n\nDrew did argue the NRC staffer charged with finding the documents \"hadn't thought to look for them earlier,\" based on her \"understanding of the scope of relevancy.\"\n\nThere were several complications that made it difficult to search for the documents, Drew told the court, but many of the documents were found \"during further searches.\"\n\n\"It was nothing nefarious. Just a matter of timing,\" Drew told Justice Greenberg, saying there was no evidence the documents were intentionally withheld or destroyed.\n\nZazelenchuk, for his part, believes there are more documents outstanding, but wants the court to order NRC and BCC to pay the full cost for his efforts on what has so far been \"a useless discovery,\" before his client's claim goes to trial in March 2020.\n\nAs to the use of \"national security\" as an explanation for why no evidence has been offered to clarify the effect of the Chinese cyberattack, Zazelenchuk says a simple solution would be to provide a sitting judge with that evidence in a sealed file.\n\n\"If it's national security, we have to have somebody watch the watchers \u2014 and who better than a judge?\" Zazelenchuk said.\n\nJustice Greenberg reserved a decision on the motion.", "Government agencies and the District of Tofino are pulling together to help the Ahousaht First Nation which is currently in a local state of emergency over its water supply.\n\nOn Sunday, contamination was detected in its reservoir and a boil water advisory went into effect for the remote First Nation, located on a small island north of Tofino, B.C.\n\nLater, officials noticed that the reservoir was at 34 per cent capacity, which is unusual given the heavy rain the area experienced on the weekend.\n\nChief Greg Louie says it was not immediately apparent what had caused the low reservoir levels even after they inspected the dam area from helicopter.\n\nIndigenous Services Canada provided support over the phone with engineers and water systems specialists early in the week and say the cause is likely a leak that the band is now working on fixing.\n\nThey will also look for other leaks in the reservoir and ISC is working with the community on reserve to provide more assistance and water testing.\n\nAhousaht's elderly have been transported to Tofino, and officials are concerned about limited firefighting abilities because of the lack of water.\n\n\"The precautionary state of emergency is really around the firefighting I think,\" said Scott Fraser, minister of Indigenous relations and reconciliation, and the MLA for the Mid Island-Pacific Rim region.\n\n\"If there was a structure fire in the community, the ability to be able to fight that is in question\"\n\nFraser said they're working with the First Nations Health Authority, Emergency Management B.C., and the District of Tofino to support the community.\n\nMeanwhile, Louie says Ahousaht's location makes it difficult to find alternative water supplies.\n\n\"If our water goes here, then that's it.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the First Nation has faced a critical water situation.

Albert Lu \u2014 who later won awards for valour for his actions the day of the death \u2014 spoke on Tuesday during the second day of a coroner's inquest into the death of Abdi Hirsi.\n\nHirsi, 26, was shot dead by police on April 9, 2015, after witnesses say he stabbed two men with a knife and began repeatedly stabbing a woman who happened to be nearby.\n\nLu arrived on the scene to what he called a dangerous situation. He says he was faced with an incoherent Hirsi, who had a dead stare and did not listen when Lu ordered him to drop the knife.\n\nLu said his priority was keeping people nearby \u2014 and the officers involved \u2014 safe.\n\nHe decided to use non-lethal force.\n\n\"I wish I would never have to do this. I went over and over it in my head. We did everything we could have done,\" Lu said.\n\nIt's still unclear why Hirsi began attacking two men near the First United Church that day. Witnesses testified that the agitated Hirsi ordered one man to pray and kneel.\n\nHirsi's mother claims her son had been robbed by somebody in Vancouver, and he'd been depressed and stressed after finishing engineering exams in Calgary. But why he attacked remains a mystery.\n\nLu \u2014 a seven-year officer \u2014 said he arrived to see Hirsi slashing at people. He said he only had seconds to assess the situation, and first tried non-lethal force methods, as per his training. But those methods did not work, he said.\n\nBean bags used first\n\nLu explained to the coroner's jury that non-lethal weapons training is not mandatory for all Vancouver police officers \u2014 and on some shifts none of the officers working are trained in the less-deadly weapons.\n\nHe told the jury that some officers opt not to train, as they don't want the added responsibility and risk it can create if an officer makes the wrong call.\n\nLu said he opted to use bean bag rounds on Hirsi initially.\n\nHe had not yet trained with a stun gun or Taser \u2014 hand-held electric weapons that are effective up to 10.6 metres away. But, even if Lu had been armed with a Taser, he says it wasn't the appropriate situation for one.\n\nHe, and other officers who testified, said stun guns are most effective if the user can get three to four metres away from the target. In this situation, said Lu, Hirsi was too violent, and the situation too chaotic.\n\n'A thousand-yard stare'\n\nLu's partner, Const. Ann Fontaine, said Hirsi was ranting and \"growling\" when they arrived.\n\nOfficers testified that Hirsi charged them with a knife in his right hand.\n\nAt some point, Hirsi seemed to back away. One juror asked why officers were so aggressive and chased him. Lu explained he didn't want Hirsi to run or hurt another bystander.\n\nLu yelled at him to drop the knife but said Hirsi didn't seem to hear him. One juror at the inquest asked Lu if Hirsi said anything. Lu said no.\n\n\"He had a thousand-yard stare \u2014 he was just determined. A look of determination,\" Lu said.\n\nSo, Lu shot Hirsi eight times with the bean bag rounds. Lu said he was then shocked to see Hirsi keep moving.\n\n\"I'm thinking what's going on? Am I dealing with somebody with body armour now?\" Lu said.\n\nOfficers testified that Hirsi then began slashing a woman.\n\nThe inquest heard that's when Const. Greg Parkes opened fire, killing Hirsi.\n\nNo other options\n\nConst. Graham Webb was one of several officers on scene when Hirsi was shot.\n\nHe told the inquest jury that Hirsi was dead by 5:11 p.m., within seven minutes of his arrival, describing him as bleeding from his head with his eyes rolled back.\n\nAt this point in Webb's testimony, Hirsi's mother sobbed and left the inquest room.\n\nWebb is a 23-year-officer with a previous policing career in Britain, where officers \"have fewer options.\" He said British police do not commonly carry guns \u2014 using shields and batons instead.\n\nA juror asked how common stabbings were on the Downtown Eastside, and Webb estimated there is at least one stabbing a week. He said in this situation, there were no other options.\n\n\"This was a lethal force situation,\" he said.\n\nConstables Lu, Parkes and Fontaine received a commendation for their actions saving bystanders from Hirsi in 2015.\n\nThe inquest continues Wednesday before the jury is expected to begin deliberations.\n\nA coroner's inquest explores what caused a death and makes recommendations but assigns no fault. Hirsi's death sparked a mandatory inquest as he was considered in police custody when he was shot.", "Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister is accusing the Opposition NDP of stoking the fears of cancer patients by alleging their care is at risk.\n\nPallister ripped the NDP on Tuesday, one day after Opposition Leader Wab Kinew said a government audit of CancerCare Manitoba would likely lead to funding cuts.\n\nPallister said Kinew's tactics were similar to those used in the 2016 provincial election, when the NDP suggested a Tory government would force patients to buy their cancer care drugs out of pocket.\n\n\"They falsely spread the story that families facing cancer will have to pay for their own cancer drugs,\" said Pallister during question period. \"Playing political football with cancer patients, Madame Speaker, the member should apologize to families affected by cancer.\"\n\nNDP leader Wab Kinew, however, argued his worries are justified.\n\nHistory of funding cuts\n\nThe province previously ordered CancerCare to find $2.5 million in savings and scrapped a new $300-million facility to handle growing demands for the treatment centre.\n\n\"The premier may not like it, but those are all facts,\" Kinew said.\n\nThe Opposition party, which revealed the province's intention for an operation review on Monday, again asserted the Tory government does not have the best interest of cancer patients in mind if its review of CancerCare focuses on dollars and cents rather than patient care.\n\nThe request for proposal states the chosen firm will review the \"overall operational efficiency and fiscal performance\" of CancerCare.\n\nThe exercise seems pointless, Kinew argued, after the KPMG report already made recommendations concerning the organization last year.\n\n\"In their ask for this review, it's only focused on the money.\"\n\nIn a statement, the province said the KPMG report offered a broad analysis of the health-care system, while the new operational review is focused on evaluating CancerCare's performance with similar organizations nationwide.\n\nKinew said CancerCare is already the gold standard in terms of care. A Canadian Institute for Health Information report found all cancer patients in Manitoba received radiation treatment within four weeks, which only one other province could claim.\n\nAny reductions in service would be devastating, Kinew said.\n\n\"We know that this is crucial because right now CancerCare is the best in the country.\"", "A massive fire that broke out Monday at an oilseed processing plant in Winnipeg's Mission Industrial Park neighbourhood is out, but residents in the St. Boniface area are left wondering what other flammable goods are stored in their neighbourhood, and whether the city has a plan in place to deal with a major catastrophe.\n\n\"We are concerned,\" said Gary Tessier, who lives in the nearby Dufresne area. \"There's all kinds of chemicals that are used in that industrial park.

Supreme Court, Justice Nathan Smith said he was left with reasonable doubt about Roudiani's culpability in the incident.\n\n\"The Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Roudiani did not act in self\u2011defence. I, therefore, am bound to find him not guilty,\" Smith wrote in his Oct. 5 judgment.\n\nThe night of the punch\n\nThe punch happened just after 2:30 a.m. on Oct. 25, 2015. Albertson, then 34, was walking with his wife Nancy down Smithe Street near Granville when they came across two groups of young men arguing in front of two limousines, according to the judgment.\n\nAlbertson was trying to make his way around or through the men when he somehow got caught up in the confrontation, and he was pushed back and forth between the two groups. His wife testified that he hadn't done anything aggressive, but she watched as a fist came out of the melee and hit Albertson directly in the side of the head.\n\nRoudiani was arrested about a month later.\n\nAt trial, he testified that shortly before throwing the fateful punch, he'd been in a separate fight across the street, outside the Gorg-O-Mish Afterhours club. His friends were waiting in one of the groups outside the Roadhouse.\n\nAfter he'd rejoined the group, Roudiani said he watched as one of his friends was punched and a fight broke out. He claimed he saw another friend pushed back by a \"a big tall guy barging through the group\" \u2014 Albertson \u2014 and believed it to be one of the men he'd been fighting on the other side of the street.\n\nRoudiani testified that he felt he had to defend himself and his smaller friend, and so he swung his arm at Albertson as he fell backwards in the skirmish.\n\n'These events unfolded very quickly'\n\nThe judge said he didn't believe Roudiani had simply swung his arm while falling or believe his testimony in general.\n\nBut Smith said the Crown had failed to disprove Roudiani had acted in self defence, and that it was plausible he'd seen Albertson as a threat.\n\n\"I cannot ignore the fact that these events unfolded very quickly. Only about 30 seconds elapsed from the time Mr. Roudiani had clearly joined the group by the white limousine to the point that Mr. Albertson was on the ground,\" Smith wrote.\n\n\"While I do not accept Mr. Roudiani's characterization of the situation as a full-scale brawl, all of the evidence is consistent with it being a tense confrontational situation with at least a potential for violence.\"", "Longtime Conservative MP Tony Clement is resigning his post as his party's justice critic after admitting to sharing sexually explicit images and a video with an individual online.\n\n\"Over the last three weeks, I have shared sexually explicit images and a video of myself to someone who I believed was a consenting female recipient.

I am committed to seeking the help and treatment I need in my personal life to make sure this will not happen again while also continuing to discharge my duties as a Member of Parliament.\"\n\nThe scandal is a blow to Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who had tapped Clement to serve as the party's justice critic in the House \u2014 an important role, given the many changes to legislation Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould has tabled in recent months.\n\nIn a follow-up statement sent shortly after Clement released his statement, Scheer said he had accepted Clement's resignation from his party duties.\n\n\"While I'm greatly disappointed with Mr. Clement's actions, I am encouraged that he has decided to seek help and I wish him all the best in doing so,\" Scheer said.\n\nLisa Raitt, the deputy leader of the Conservative Party, will assume the justice role effective immediately, Scheer said.\n\nClement is also a member of the top secret national security and intelligence committee \u2014 a special joint parliamentary committee composed of MPs and senators that oversees the work of the country's intelligence agencies, including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the Communications Security Establishment, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nClement was an early adopter of social media as a tool for political communication in Canada.
