["California is on fire.\n\nThe Northern California Camp Fire has killed at least 48 people and destroyed more than 7,600 homes and 260 businesses as of Wednesday morning, making it the deadliest and most destructive fire in state history. The Woolsey Fire near Malibu, California has claimed two lives, forced 275,000 people to evacuate, and destroyed the homes of celebrities including Gerard Butler, Miley Cyrus, and Neil Young.\n\nRead more: The death toll from California's fires has risen to 50, with thousands of homes destroyed in Malibu and Northern California\n\nWith so much destruction, so close to home \u2014 the Camp Fire burns around 150 miles from San Francisco, filling the city with smoke \u2014 the tech community has responded. Some have even offered up their homes over Twitter.\n\nVenture capitalists, like Redpoint Ventures' Ryan Sarver (formerly Director of Platform at Twitter) and ENIAC Ventures' Nihal Mehta, have offered homes that they own in the area to those displaced by the fire.\n\nAirbnb has opened up doors at scale\n\nAirbnb has been able to do something similar at a much larger scale.\n\nThe company's Open Homes Program, which was created back in 2012 to assist with relief from Hurricane Sandy, allows hosts to offer up their homes to those displaced by the fires.\n\nAirbnb told Business Insider that so far over 2,000 hosts on its platform have offered their homes to evacuees of the Camp Fire and Woolsey's Fires. To date, nearly 1,000 evacuees and relief workers have been housed.\n\nKellie Bentz, Airbnb's Head of Global Disaster Response and Relief, told us over the phone on Wednesday: \"It's always terrible, but also good for us when it's close to home because it allows us to get a lot closer to the situation. In this case, we've been able to do that pretty quickly.\"\n\nThis week, the company improved its mobile sign up process for evacuees and is planning on opening up a hotline by Thursday for those in need of shelter.\n\n\"We're just trying to make it as easy as possible to book,\" Bentz explained.\n\nBentz said she helped one woman book a home on Tuesday who needed to flee her Southern California home with her friend and three dogs.\n\n\"They were literally on the side of the road,\" Benz explains. \"The hard part about wildfires is, we call them 'no notice events.' Typically, it's so fast moving. It's hard to be as prepared as a hurricane where at least you have a few hours to pack up. With [the wildfires], people literally just got what they could and ran out.\"\n\nFacebook, Google, Apple have also responded\n\nFacebook is helping as well.\n\nThe Menlo Park-based company committed to matching up to $500,000 in donations made on Facebook to American Red Cross' California wildfire relief efforts. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed with Business Insider that the match was met as of Tuesday, and in total, including the company's matching contribution, the Facebook community has raised more than $1.7 million for the American Red Cross.\n\nAlso, through Facebook Fundraisers \u2014 which the company announced on Wednesday had helped raise over $1 billion\u2014 users have been able to set up campaigns to help those who have lost their homes and valuables.\n\nOne user, whose brother and 97-year-old grandma both lost their homes in Paradise, California, has helped her family raise over $11,500 over Facebook. Another, who lives in Southern California, has helped raise over $7,500 to provide extra supplies, like water bottles and snacks, for firefighters and victims.\n\nThe Google-owned mapping service Waze, is doing its part in helping where it can. Waze tweeted last week that it is working \"around-the-clock\" to make sure maps were updated with road closures, as well as shelter information.\n\nGoogle.org has also committed $500,000 in grants to organizations helping those displaced by the fires.\n\nApple has announced, via a tweet from CEO Tim Cook, that it would be donating to fire relief efforts as well.", "Handout photo of an artistic impression of a sunset from Barnard's star on the newly detected planet designated Barnard's Star b Thomson Reuters WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A frozen and dimly lit planet, dubbed a \"Super-Earth,\" may be orbiting the closest single star to our solar system, astronomers said on Wednesday, based on two decades of scientific observations.\n\nThe planet, estimated to be at least 3.2 times more massive than Earth, was spotted circling Barnard's Star, a type of relatively cool and low-mass star called a red dwarf, about 6 light-years away from our solar system, comparatively close in cosmic terms. It is believed to orbit Barnard's Star every 233 days.\n\nPlanets orbiting stars beyond our solar system are called exoplanets. Nearly 4,000 have been discovered. The newly discovered one is the second closest to our solar system ever found. It is thought to be a \"Super-Earth,\" a category of planets more massive than Earth but smaller than the large gas planets.\n\n\"After a very careful analysis, we are 99 percent confident that the planet is there,\" researcher Ignasi Ribas of the Institute of Space Studies of Catalonia and the Institute of Space Sciences said in a statement. \"However, we'll continue to observe this fast-moving star to exclude possible, but improbable, natural variations of the stellar brightness which could masquerade as a planet.\"\n\nThe only closer stars than Barnard's Star are part of the triple-star system Alpha Centauri, located a bit more than 4 light-years from our solar system. Two years ago, astronomers announced the discovery of a roughly Earth-sized planet circling Proxima Centauri, part of the Alpha Centauri system, in an orbit that might enable liquid water to exist on its surface, raising the possibility that it could harbor alien life.\n\nThe newly detected planet orbiting Barnard's Star may not be so hospitable, with surface temperatures of perhaps minus 274 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 170 degrees Celsius). Barnard's Star provides the frigid planet only 2 percent of the energy that the sun provides Earth.\n\nThe researchers studied the planet by combining measurements from several high-precision instruments mounted on telescopes around the world.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature.\n\n(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "The New Orleans Saints' Week 11 matchup with the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles Sunday will look a little bit different than every other game they have played at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome this season.\n\nThanks to a golfing bet struck between Saints head coach Sean Payton and Eagles head coach Doug Pederson in March, New Orleans will be sporting their popular alternate color rush jerseys, while the Eagles will wear their typical green home jerseys.\n\nThe coaches played a round of golf together while in Orlando, Florida for the NFL Annual Meeting. On the third hole, they struck up the bet that allowed the winner to choose the jerseys for Sunday's contest. Pederson won and chose to rock the team's home jerseys in the Big Easy. According to the New Orleans Advocate's Nick Underhill, Payton also donated $5,000 to the Autism Challenge in Philadelphia as a stipulation of another bet.\n\nIn addition to winning the bet, Pederson also earned some points with the Eagles' front office:\n\n\"I was fortunate enough to win that bet,\" Pederson said, per Zack Rosenblatt of NJ Advance Media. \"I tell you it was great because I was able to talk to my owner and general manager later in the day and explained to them what had happened and obviously they couldn't believe it.\"\n\nOn a different hole, Payton suggested that they play with the alternate city's cuisine on the line. Payton once again lost the bet and subsequently sent beignets, coffee, and other New Orleans food to the Eagles' facilities.\n\nPederson said that their natural competitive instincts kicked in when they took to the course. He was able to cash in shortly after that.\n\n\"After a while, your competitive juices start flowing, you kinda try to feel each other out a bit to see 'OK, how is he going to play, how am I going to play,'\" Pederson said. \"Then I think Sean and I both got to the point where it was like we have to do something here. We have to play for something. We started talking about it, talking about jersey colors and Sean was like, there's only so many things as head coaches that we can control. Obviously, we can control [jersey colors] and we said hey this is a great idea.\"", "Kevin Durant and Draymond Green's on-court spat, which turned into an explicit and intense exchange about Durant's impending free agency, is threatening to tear the Golden State Warriors apart.\n\nAfter Durant criticized Green for his late-game decision-making during an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, Green unleashed a tirade on Durant, reportedly calling him a \"b----\" and questioning Durant's handling of his free agency.\n\nThe Warriors suspended Green for one game on Tuesday, saying Green crossed a line. While many teammates agreed that Green went too far, according to The Athletic's Marcus Thompson, some felt Green's criticisms of Durant weren't off-base.\n\n\"Durant's free agency has been a low-key issue with the players. It registered as a small irritation. The burden of talking about it, reading about it, hearing about it, grew heavier in Year 3 of the Durant Experience...\n\n\"According to several in the locker room, Durant could have ended this by just saying how much he loves playing with the Warriors and his teammates and leave it at that, even if he departs in the offseason. They are all prepared for him to leave so they just want the cloud hanging over them to go away. Another option would be to reject all questions about free agency and force the media to focus on this season, a way of protecting his teammates.\n\n\"Durant has said he doesn't want to lead anybody on. But Green is part of a contingent that believes Durant has a hand in creating the hype about his free agency, a tangential focus that detracts from their mission of winning a third straight title.\"\n\nSince joining the Warriors, Durant has taken two \"1+1\" contracts \u2014 one year, then a second-year player option. This is the same type of deal LeBron James took with the Cleveland Cavaliers in his second stint. For him, the deals served two purposes:\n\n1. To maximize his earnings. When a player joins a new team, it takes three years before that team has that player's full \"Bird rights.\" At that point, they can re-sign him to a longer, pricier deal than anyone else in the NBA.\n\n2. To apply pressure to the Cavs. With the threat of James leaving each season, the Cavs had to be perpetually in \"win now\" mode and making moves to maximize their chances.\n\nDurant is doing the same thing, and he's part of a tiny set of NBA players who could afford to do it. If possible, players like to lock in long contracts for the security that comes with them. James and Durant are some of the only players who could play on one-year deals and know that teams would still sign them to max contracts, even in the event of a significant injury.\n\nCuriously, though, Durant hasn't been maximizing his earnings as James has. He took less money last offseason to help the team re-sign players like Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston. If Durant had taken his full max, the Warriors wouldn't have had the money to re-sign them.\n\nRead more:Kevin Durant gave up $10 million for the upcoming season, and it could quietly be the most consequential move of the NBA offseason\n\nInstead, Durant's contracts seem to be about keeping his flexibility. Even while helping the Warriors win two titles, winning Finals MVP both times, and finding the higher level of basketball and culture that he craved, Durant has left his future open. There's a sense in the NBA world that the Warriors are still Stephen Curry's team, even with the added boost of dominance that Durant has brought along.\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty There have been hints of uneasiness about the relationship with Durant since he arrived. It took Curry two seasons to learn how to play with Durant (before his recent groin injury, he had figured it out in dominant fashion this year). Last year, Steve Kerr told ESPN's Zach Lowe that he had a crucial, sit-down talk with Durant during the middle of the season because he felt Durant \"drifting.\"\n\nAfter winning the championship, Warriors GM Bob Myers publicly ribbed Durant, saying that Durant couldn't have any contract he wants, adding that only Curry could. Some felt it was an awkward moment.\n\nRead more:The Warriors baffled the NBA world with several awkward comments about Kevin Durant's next contract\n\nAnd now, as Thompson and others have reported, as Durant heads into free agency this summer, the questions about where he may go are hovering above the team.\n\nThough James invited the speculation with the Cavs with his contract structure, last season, on the verge of free agency (the first when people thought he might indeed leave), James shut down all talk until the end of the season. As Thompson noted, Durant has not done that, and it's rubbing some teammates the wrong way.\n\nMost expect that Green and Durant will patch things up and the season will go on. The Warriors are talented enough to survive a rift, even if there are lingering hurt feelings. But as the season goes on, even if Durant were to shut down questions about his future, his free agency will still be approaching, and speculation will continue.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

The center will create some 5,000 white-collar jobs with a median salary of $158,000, according to the State of Tennessee. These employees will help optimize Amazon's ultra-complex supply chain, which powered the shipment of five billion packages last year through Prime alone.\n\nAmazon announced the center on November 13, when the megacompany also announced its HQ2 locations \u2014 Long Island City, a neighborhood of Queens, New York, and the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia.\n\nExperts told Business Insider they weren't surprised by the Nashville pick.\n\nThe Middle Tennessee city has the right mix of amenities and talent for the center, said Beth Davis-Sramek, who is an associate professor in supply chain management at Auburn University's Harbert College of Business.\n\nThere are dozens of higher education institutions in the city, and art, food, and entertainment are flourishing. The city is already a hub for the health care industry, with some 270,000 health care workers.\n\nThe number of jobs in Nashville grew by 19% from 2012 to 2017\u2014 the third-largest jump in the country.

And plenty of supply chain gurus are already living there.\n\nCompanies like Dollar General and Tractor Supply, which have industry-lauded supply chain operations, are based in the Nashville area. And schools with leading logistics programs, like Auburn University and the University of Tennessee, are nearby.\n\n\"The reality is that you do have plenty of experts in the region already,\" David Marcotte, senior vice president of strategic advisory service in operations at Kantar Consulting, told Business Insider.\n\nDon't expect blue-collar Amazon employment to be popping up around Nashville\n\nHowever, Nashville isn't as strategic a location when it comes to the company's 125,000 full-time fulfillment center workers. Comprising around 20% of Amazon's 613,300 total employees, these warehouse employees pick, sort, pack, and load/unload goods to head to consumers' homes.\n\nFinding the location for a mega-warehouse is, in some ways, more complicated than figuring out where to put a corporate office. It's crucial to consider where the warehouse sits in the larger transportation network, like if it's accessible by seaport, multiple highway routes, railways, cargo airlines, and so on.\n\nTake the 80-acre Amazon warehouse that's opening next year in Tucson, Arizona. Marcotte said Tucson is \"ideal\" for such a warehouse, which will employ 1,500 people, because it's on a variety of rail junctions. Freight there can be easily moved between trucks and trains.\n\nRead more: Peeing in trash cans, constant surveillance, and asthma attacks on the job: Amazon workers tell us their warehouse horror stories\n\nCould such a mega-warehouse open in Nashville? \"It would not quite fit my absolute ideal, but it's pretty good,\" Marcotte said.\n\nBryan Ball, supply chain management research director for market intelligence firm Aberdeen, added that it would be \"a bit unusual.\"\n\nOn the plus side, Nashville is close to the seaports in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. (However, these seaports are relatively small.) It's also within a day's drive of major metropolises like Miami, Dallas, New York City, and Washington D.C.\n\nPlenty of companies have distribution centers in the area, Ball said. Amazon alone has four in or around Nashville, according to supply chain consultancy MWPVL International.\n\nAn Amazon fulfillment center. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images\n\nStill, the convergence of highways and railways in the city isn't quite as appealing as, say, Charlotte, North Carolina, Reno, Nevada, or the area between Oklahoma and Texas, Ball said. Louisville, Kentucky would also be an ideal choice, Davis-Sramek said.\n\nExperts kept pointing to a city about 200 miles west of Nashville as an ideal place for an Amazon mega-warehouse: Memphis, Tennessee. That's the city of the largest cargo airport in North America, with 11,000 FedEx employees alone.\n\nBut Nashville wins out for white collar over Memphis or other typical freight cities because, well, it's cooler.\n\n\"If I'm recruiting from outside of the region, Nashville has somewhat more of a cach\u00e9,\" Marcotte said. \"That's just how it's perceived.\"", "A married Arizona couple will be responsible for paying $12.23 million dollars to Nintendo of America after being accused of copyright infringement in federal court.\n\nIn July, Nintendo filed a complaint against Jacob Mathias and Mathias Designs LLC in the U.S. District Court of Arizona, accusing the two of operating the websites LoveROMS.com and LoveRETRO.co, both of which distributed unauthorized downloads of Nintendo video games and software.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by TorrentFreak, Jacob's wife, Cristian Mathias, was later named and added to the complaint following the original lawsuit' filing.\n\nThough the site was taken offline shortly after the complaint was filed, LoveROMS was one of the most popular emulation websites on the internet, bringing in 17 million visitors a month, according to the court documents cited by TorrentFreak. The site offered unofficial downloads for hundreds of retro video games from Nintendo and other publishers, along with emulation software to make the games playable on a computer.\n\nAccording to the report, Nintendo's original complaint suggested that Mathias Designs should be responsible for paying $150,000 per Nintendo game hosted on the site, and $2,000,000 for each violated trademark.

The test uses 200,000 genetic markers and 100 times more genetic information than its competitors. It checks for over 250 different breed types and 175 genetic health conditions and traits \u2014 and it has partnered with Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine (the leading veterinary school in the country) and a pioneer in consumer genetics \u2014 Spencer Wells \u2014 to combine cutting-edge science and pet care. They're the people who are ecstatic to tell you they recently discovered why some dogs have blue eyes.\n\nKnowing your dog's genetic history is great for the shallow interest of curiosity and dog park small talk, but it can also help you navigate potential health risks, avoid medications they could be sensitive too, and even help you decide how big of a home you're going to need in the future.\n\nHere's how the dog DNA test works:Order the test online, activate it, swab the cheek of your dog, and mail the sample back to the Embark lab in a pre-paid return envelope. In two to four weeks, you'll receive the results. If you're unsure how to swab your dog's cheek correctly, there are video tutorials on the site.\n\nI tried the Embark dog DNA test on our rescue dog, Nellie, to see how it worked in real life. If you keep scrolling down to the bottom of this article, you can see the exact steps we went through in greater detail.

It was as succinct as \"she's mostly a German Shepherd\" and \"she's clear of all the health risks we check for\" and as granular as links to learn how the process is done and breakdowns of what each genetic condition is as well as which breeds it's commonly found in. There are even linked citations in some sections where research was referred to.\n\nThe Embark dog DNA test is not cheap at $199, but it's information that could improve or extend the life of your dog \u2014 and for most owners, that's not a bad price to pay. Plus, with the holiday discount code \"HOLIDNA\" you can save yourself $40 now through December 31.\n\nAll in all, it's a great tool \u2014 and something most dog owners will probably be excited to learn about.

Zuckerberg reportedly did not appear at these meetings.\n\nKaplan warned that banning Trump, then a candidate for the highest office in the land, could be seen as a violation of free speech, and that it could also be cause for a conservative backlash.\n\nThe trio ultimately determined that Trump's remarks didn't break Facebook's rules, says the report, and his account remained active.\n\n\"We were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,\" Schrage, who left Facebook this summer, told the Times.\n\nThe incident highlights how Facebook executives were uncomfortable with how Trump used Facebook to amplify his often-controversial messaging \u2014 a concern shared by some others in Silicon Valley. There have been repeated calls over the last few years for Twitter, Trump's social network of choice, to ban the president over alleged rule violations. But CEO Jack Dorsey has refused, arguing that the president's tweets have inherent \"newsworthiness.\"\n\nThe detail was disclosed in an exhaustive report from The New York Times, which details how Facebook executives attempted to deflect criticism as the company's scandals mounted over the last few year.\n\nIn a statement, Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone told Business Insider: \"This has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face.

Obama explained that nine months before, a knife-wielding man had broken into the White House through this very door and, since then, they had started locking the door.\n\nThe usher also reminded Obama that all of the news cameras were trained on that very entrance, and someone else suggested that they use a loading door on the ground floor that was more out of the way.\n\n\"We're getting out!\" Obama remembers telling her daughter.\n\nShe wrote:\n\n\"We made our way down a marble staircase and over red carpets, around the busts of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin and past the kitchen until suddenly we were outdoors.

Parallel parking is just one part of the two-week training that New York City firefighters go through. The end result? They get certified to drive 42-foot-long fire trucks. The training includes lectures, written tests, a virtual driving simulator, and, just as you might expect, an obstacle course.\n\nFrom the first day, firefighters are behind the wheel, but they aren't ready to drive on city streets yet. They practice just like you might in Driver's Ed, at a parking lot. The first challenge is pretty straightforward. Drive in a straight line between two lines of cones. Then, back up the way you came. After that, it gets trickier. Weave in and out of cones without knocking any of them over and then, do that backwards.\n\nMike Jackson: One of the specific things we work on on the EVOC course is when we're maneuvering through the barrels, is we're lining up, let's say, our rear wheel tire. When that rear wheel tire is lined up against one of the barrels, then we can make our turn and we will not hit that barrel. So even though it seems a little simplistic maybe, but it represents, it could be a car out there. It could be the corner we're trying to get into.\n\nNarrator: Once they've gotten that down next up is parallel parking. Which, after the backwards cone weaving, doesn't look too bad. In fact, they use a similar technique to backing through the obstacle course. They line up the back tire with the car they're trying to park behind. After drivers master the parking lot, it's time to hit the streets. Well, sort of. They practice driving on Randall's Island, located right in between Manhattan and Brooklyn. That's where the Fire Department Training Academy is. In some ways, learning to drive a fire truck is like learning to drive any large vehicle but with one major difference.\n\nJackson: A big difference between driving our fire trucks as opposed to driving a large vehicle like a bus or a sanitation truck, is that we're responding to emergencies. There's an added stress on the time to get there and everyone handles that differently. We try to prepare the students to be ready for those emergencies.\n\nNarrator: But you can't do a test run in the middle of the city. So instead, one way firefighters prepare for this is by practicing in a simulator. Trainers can program the simulator to mimic different hazards. They can increase the number of cars on the road, make them drive fast or slow, and add things like roadblocks and pedestrians. But not every firefighter learns to chase down fires in the same truck. In fact, from the very start firefighters are divided into companies: the engine company and the ladder company. And this determines which type of truck each firefighter will drive.\n\nTurns out, the term fire truck isn't a catchall. There are two main types of fire trucks in New York City. The fire truck is the one with a ladder on it and a fire engine is the one used to pump water. Fire truck. Fire engine. The ladder truck is 42 feet long and the engine truck is 30 feet long. So maneuvering either one down narrow city streets requires careful driving skills. But a driver's job doesn't end when they arrive at the fire. Once there, the driver of the engine leads the charge for getting water onto the fire. The driver attaches the hose to the fire hydrant to fill the pump in the truck and then, does calculations to make sure there's enough pressure in the hose line to spray out a strong stream of water. At the same time, the driver of a ladder truck raises and positions the ladder or bucket to reach high stories of the building. And if anyone is trapped in the front of the building, they help get those people out.\n\nSo you might be wondering what happens if a firefighter doesn't pass the final driver's test.\n\nJackson: We've had that in the past, where students have not shown a proficient skill in driving the vehicles. You'll still go back to your firehouse and be, there's many other positions you can do, so sometimes they can come back. They train a little more at the firehouse and they come back, and then they're a little more proficient or they've gotten better where they pass with no problem.\n\nNarrator: So, next time you see a fire truck barreling towards you, just do what you can to get out of the way. The person behind the wheel of the 42-foot-long 40-ton truck will appreciate it.", "The Earth is wonderfully weird.

Now that his time with Pittsburgh is almost certainly done, on Wednesday there was only one thing left for his teammates to do \u2014 raid his locker for shoes.\n\nAt first, the news read like a joke \u2014 was this a bit that the Steelers were doing to have a bit of fun with Bell's departure? Was it happening in jest or in protest?\n\nBut soon after, the video came out, featuring Steelers linebacker Bud Dupree delightedly thanking Bell for his new cleats.\n\nIt's just the latest in a series of odd goodbyes between Bell and his former team.\n\nEarlier in the week Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin replied simply, \"So be it,\" when asked how he would feel if Bell failed to report.\n\nQuarterback Ben Roethlisberger said he had attempted to reach out to Bell before his deadline to report. \"I texted him yesterday before the deadline asking him \u2014 texted \u2014 saying I was hoping he was going to show up, and if he decided not to I wish him nothing but the best,\" Roethlisberger said.\n\nBell never replied.\n\nThe Steelers may be without Bell moving forward, but as things stand they're still one of the hottest teams in the NFL without him, having won five straight games including a 52-21 trouncing of the Panthers on Sunday night.\n\nBell may have laced up his cleats for the Steelers for the last time, but it looks as though his teammates are happy enough to lace up for him.", "Earlier this spring, Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a very public manner related to its privacy scandals and the Cambridge Analytica affair.\n\nZuckerberg called Cook's criticism \"extremely glib,\" and he was apparently seething behind closed doors. He was mad enough to tell his executives to use Android phones instead of Apple's iPhones, according to a massive new report from The New York Times.\n\n\"Mr. Cook's criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones, since the operating system has far more users than Apple's,\" states the report.\n\nThe zing earlier this year that might have upset Zuckerberg came during an interview on MSNBC.\n\nRecode's Kara Swisher asked Cook a question about the Cambridge Analytica incident, in which private Facebook user data was stolen from 50 million users. She asked if the Apple CEO was in Zuckerberg's place, \"what would you do?\"\n\nHe answered: \"What would do? I wouldn't be in this situation.\"\n\nIn the same interview and in subsequent speeches, Cook called for privacy regulation that would impact businesses like Facebook that make significantly more of their money from ads than Apple, which makes money from hardware sales.\n\nBut Cook and Zuckerberg have traded barbs for years. Cook said in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2014 that \"when an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product.\"\n\nThis apparently got under Zuckerberg's skin even back then, with a journalist from Time noticing the tension in a profile of the Facebook founder:\n\n\"But before that happens Zuckerberg also notes \u2014 and it was the only time I saw him display irritation \u2014 that Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote something similar in September in a statement spelling out Apple's privacy policy: 'When an online service is free, you're not the customer. You're the product.' The shot was probably meant for Google, but Facebook was definitely in the blast radius. 'A frustration I have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment with your customers,' Zuckerberg says. 'I think it's the most ridiculous concept. What, you think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with them? If you were in alignment with them, then they'd make their products a lot cheaper!'\"\n\nYears later, it appears Zuckerberg still isn't \"in alignment\" with Apple if he's making his management team eschew a specific brand of phone.", "Uber has released its in-house financials for the third quarter.

We hope not.\"\n\nTrump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all cars, trucks, and auto parts coming into the US. The warning was enough to prompt European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker to agree to a preliminary deal with the US to expand trade between the two countries and avoid the tariffs.\n\nBut lack of progress on a final deal has Trump reportedly eager again to impose auto tariffs. Free trade advocates in the Trump administration dissuaded the president from imposing the tariffs during a meeting on Tuesday, according to multiple reports, but the possibility remains of auto tariffs some time in the future.\n\nAny auto tariffs would be particularly damaging for the EU given how many cars come from the continent to the US every year.

But voter ID is a very important thing.\"\n\nThe cereal reference was not the first botched grocery analogy Trump has used to push for voter ID laws. He incorrectly said at a Tampa, Florida, rally in August that grocery shopping requires picture ID.\n\nIn fact, grocery purchases \u2014 and most retail transactions \u2014 don't require any identification, unless the products are tobacco, alcohol, fireworks, or firearms and the customer appears younger than certain age thresholds.\n\nIt's possible Trump was referring to the mostly outdated practice of cashiers requesting ID for customers who pay with checks or credit cards, but such requests have become relatively rare in recent years and are done at retailers' discretion, not by law.\n\nRead more: Trump appears not to understand grocery shopping in latest push for voter ID laws\n\nEarly voters cast their ballots in Atlanta, Georgia in the 2018 midterm elections in October.

But May was subsequently treated to a verbal lashing, the report said.\n\nTrump reportedly blasted May over Iran, the state of Brexit negotiations, and the US-European Union trade relationship.\n\nTrump's anger caught May and her aides off guard, The Washington Post said, despite the fact the prime minister has been on the receiving end of such behavior previously.\n\nWhile the episode comes as something of a shock, especially considering Trump's fairly cordial trip to the UK in July, the row is also part of a growing trend of Trump lashing out at allied leaders.\n\nThe Macron fight\n\nIn addition to berating May over the phone, Trump also spent an entire weekend in Paris feuding with other world leaders \u2014 particularly the weekend's host, French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nA bromance that had already been strained by trade tensions appeared to completely fall apart after Macron suggested to French radio that Europe needs to build up its defense forces to protect against possible threats, including the US.\n\nWhile the French president insisted the reference to the US was only to imply that Europe needed to rely less on the US, Trump launched into a days-long tirade against Macron and France.\n\nThe fight became more intense after Macron publicly denounced \"nationalism\" during a speech Sunday. Trump has repeatedly used the term to describe himself in recent weeks. According to The Washington Post, Trump took the comments as a personal attack.\n\nThe frosty meeting culminated in Trump's Twitter attack s on Tuesday that went after Macron's approval rating, France's trade treatment of US wines, and even France's World War II record.\n\nNot the first time\n\nTrump's back and forth with European leaders isn't the only time in recent memory that the president has clashed with the US's closest allies during an international trip.\n\nIn June, Trump fought with a variety of theoretically friendly world leaders at the G7 summit in Canada. During those meetings, Trump held awkward meetings with a slew of foreign leaders, including:\n\nAn encounter with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during which Trump tossed a Starburst candy onto the table and said, \"Here, Angela. Don't say I never give you anything.\"\n\nA meeting during which Trump complained about immigration and told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that if the US were to \"send him 25 million Mexicans,\" the prime minister would be \"be out of office very soon.\"\n\nA battle with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in which Trump made him the target of an extended Twitter tirade before, during, and after the meeting.\n\nWhile the fights add a layer of personal intrigue, they could also have some real world policy consequences.\n\nThe personal animus between Trudeau and Trump appeared to cause a delay in final negotiations over the updated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in August, while Macron and Merkel have ramped up calls for a pan-European defense force in the wake of Trump's NATO skepticism.\n\nWhile these spats are unlikely to undermine lengthy relationships, Trump's brash nature could cause consequential shifts in how the world treats the US.\n\nThe next chance for international fireworks comes at the end of November, when Trump is scheduled to travel to Argentina for the G20 summit.

Amazon Instagram\n\nWith no annual fee, and an impressive 5% back on all Amazon and Whole Foods purchases (with a Prime membership), the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is the highest tiered card of the four offered by e-commerce giant.\n\nWhile a $119 annual Amazon Prime membership fee might deter some people (though we think the cost is justified for these 14 reasons), the card has virtually no downsides for existing Prime members. With points redeemed seamlessly for cash on the Amazon site, the earning system is one of the most straightforward of any rewards card and adds instant savings for big users of the site.\n\nBenefits of the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card\n\nWhen it comes to rewards credit cards, the two important factors to keep in mind are how do you earn points and how do you burn points? And when it comes to the Amazon Prime Rewards, the answer for both is by shopping on Amazon Prime.\n\nIf you're not a Prime member, the first question is whether or not you want to pay for the service. Amazon's Prime currently costs $119 a year, or $12.99 a month, and has become tremendously popular, with Amazon disclosing it had reached 100 million subscribers worldwide last year. The free two-day shipping service has grown as Amazon has added streaming services via Prime video and exclusive offers to its members on Prime Day. New subscribers can sign up for a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime here.\n\nWhile the benefits justify the cost for many, we wouldn't argue joining Prime just to earn the 5% on this card (unless you spend over $6,000 a year on Amazon). If you don't plan on enrolling in Prime but still want to earn cash for using the site, we'd recommend checking out the standard Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card, which earns 3% back on Amazon purchases.\n\nHowever, for those who are existing Prime users, the Amazon Prime Rewards is definitely worth it.\n\nThere is no additional cost for the card, and you instantly and seamlessly earn 5% on every purchase made through Amazon and Whole Foods. Your card is automatically linked to your account, and Amazon makes it incredibly easy for you to use your points toward purchases. Available points are displayed at every checkout, where you have the option to put them toward your current purchase with the click of a button. No necessary portals, no redemption process.\n\nIf you're like me, there's no single company you'd rather have this deal with, as Amazon is basically a proxy for the entire online merchant ecosystem.\n\nVirtually everything is available there, and it appears to only be growing in inventory. For frequent shoppers of the platform, this is basically like earning 5% cash back on everything you buy \u2014 clothes, holiday and wedding gifts, or large electronics and furniture purchases. If you are living with roommates, you can order household essentials that are split between everyone and reap 5% while being the roommate who conveniently takes care of everything.\n\nYou can also earn cash back bonuses on certain specific products or categories by exploring the Prime Card Bonus Offers page. When you purchase something through that page, you'll get anywhere from 10-20% back.\n\nThe card also recently added its 5% cash back to Whole Foods purchases after the company was acquired by Amazon. This not only makes it one of the highest earning grocery cards we've seen (to those with loyalty to the brand), but its 2% back, restaurants, drug stores, and gas stations puts it on par with many all-around spending cards.\n\nOther Visa Signature benefits\n\nThe Amazon Prime Rewards is a Visa Signature Card, which grants it a number of travel, auto, and purchase protections you expect from other Visa Signature cards. These include:\n\nTravel accident insurance: When you pay for transportation with your Amazon Prime Rewards card, you are eligible to receive accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000.\n\nWhen you pay for transportation with your Amazon Prime Rewards card, you are eligible to receive accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000.

Purchase protection and extended warranty: New purchases are covered for 120 days against damage or theft up to $500 per claim and $50,000 per account. Eligible warranties of three years or less are also extended an additional year.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is recommended for anyone who has an Amazon Prime membership. If you're already paying for the service, it's hard to justify not getting an additional 5% in cash back, unless you have a hard credit card limit.\n\nThere is no annual fee for the card, and the $70 gift card received upon approval provides an immediate cash incentive. Amazon has extended their 5% eligibility to Whole Foods, and it's not improbable to think the card's benefits will extend to other subsidiaries should Amazon continue their acquisition spree. The 2% back at restaurants, drug stores, and gas adds versatility to what is already highly efficient company-specific card.\n\nRead more about Amazon Prime membership benefits:", "Phone calls, yoga, a haircut\u2026 the list of things to do while commuting in a self-driving car is virtually endless.\n\nBecause of this new realm of possibilities, there could be an unlikely winner from the autonomous revolution: RV-maker Winnebago.\n\n\"We would not be surprised if far off in the future, the company greatly expanded its sales in urban markets with autonomous motor homes for city commuting,\" David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said in a recent note to clients.\n\n\"We think that in a Level 4 or Level 5 AV world, commuters will not be content to sit idle or merely listen to headphones, and a motor home could be used as a rolling service provider, such as a bank or salon, so people can make the most efficient use of their commuting time,\" he continued.\n\nRead more: These are the 7 best RVs on the market for under $150,000\n\nOf course, humans probably won't stop there.

And with Winnebago's stock price down more than 50% this year alone, they probably won't want to miss out either.\n\n\"As for Winnebago's executives,\" writes Whiston,\" if they do think we are crazy, they have been polite enough not to tell us.\"", "Show your boss that you're competent. Strelka Institute/Flickr/Attribution License\n\nWhen you face a problem at work, how you communicate it to your manager can have a big impact on whether or not you move to the next level in your career.\n\nIt's made a big difference in my own career and it's one of the top things I look for when I'm considering promoting people on my team.\n\nI lead research for Business Insider Intelligence and manage over 20 analysts and editors. At some point, everyone on my team has had an issue come up where they asked me to step in and help out. These issues are usually relatively tough to solve \u2014 otherwise they wouldn't need to be escalated. And that means new work and a new time commitment.\n\nA key to getting ahead is understanding that managers often have an overabundance of employees with problems, but the people that they most like to work with are those that solve them. Bringing a solution to the table rather than a problem is an indicator that you are competent and can be trusted to take on more responsibility.\n\nIt's really easy to spot competence. It's all in how you communicate the problems you're facing:\n\nLevel 1: 'I have a problem. What should I do?'\n\nThis is a very junior way to communicate a problem. You are creating more work for your manager because you are asking them to solve the problem for you.\n\nIt's okay for entry level employees or employees who are training for a new role, but if you don't get beyond this type of communication, your career is going to stagnate and you might even be let go.\n\nLevel 2: 'I have a problem. Here are potential solutions.'\n\nJust showing that you've thought about how to solve a problem is an indicator of next level potential. You're still giving your manager work, but if you provide good options for solving the problem, then it's a lot less work.\n\nRelated: Here's exactly how to write an email so your super busy boss gets back to you\n\nLevel 3a: 'I have a problem. Here are potential solutions. This is what I recommend. Here's why.'\n\nIf you can do this habitually and your recommendations are sound, your manager will absolutely love you. No matter what level you are in your career, there are situations where this is the best way to communicate a problem \u2014 some problems are going to be outside of your purview to solve and you need a nod from your manager, or the CEO, or the board before you can act (level 3b wouldn't be appropriate in these cases).\n\nLevel 3b: 'A problem came up. These were my options. I chose to do this, and here's why. It's handled.'\n\n\"It's handled\" is music to a busy manager's ears. This is how to communicate issues that have come up that you have authority to make a decision on. It keeps your manager in the loop, so if they're asked about the issue they aren't caught off guard, and it doesn't create additional work.\n\nRelated: 21 psychological tricks that will help you ace a job interview\n\nLevel 4: 'It sounds like you are having this problem. Here are some options to solve it. Here is how I can help.'\n\nIf you are anticipating your manager's needs and providing solutions, then you'll likely become his or her most relied-upon employee. This is someone who is operating at the next level. The caveat is that in order to do this effectively, your own responsibilities already need to be handled \u2014 otherwise it's going to backfire.\n\nLearning to communicate in a way that will get you to the next level is the easy part. The hard part is developing the skills to solve problems, coming up with good solutions, communicating competence habitually, and following through on what you say you are going to do.\n\nJohn Heggestuen is the Vice President of Research for Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium market research service covering digital transformation.

They'd say, 'It looks like all of you are having a really good time. We love the product.

But as Pinterest grew in scale, Silbermann stopped recruiting people through weekly outings.\n\n\"I remember when we were recruiting early on. There were these people that were at great jobs, and I would almost feel guilty pulling them out of this great job,\" Silbermann said. \"We didn't have a cool office. It was bring your own computer.

But learning shouldn't stop at a certain age or even career level. In today's fast-moving digital world, it's important to continually commit to expanding your knowledge base to get further in your current career \u2014 or explore a completely different one.\n\nLuckily, learning these new skills is as convenient as having access to a computer. Udemy, an online learning platform, offers 80,000 courses \u2014 starting at $9.99 for a Black Friday sale\u2014 taught by expert instructors across a variety of subject areas. Here are some to look into if you want to get ahead.\n\n1. Web development\n\nBeing able to design and create websites, along with the back-end technical aspects, is an invaluable skill. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean pay for web developers in 2017 was $74,110 annually and $35.63 an hour, but salaries at the top end of the scale can go as high as $122,320. And the number of jobs is expected to grow by 15% (faster than the average) between 2017 and 2026. Udemy's courses in Web development include programming languages such as HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript, MySQL, and more.\n\n2. Digital marketing\n\nDigital marketing can encompass everything from SEO and email marketing to social media strategy and analytics. And all of these tactics are important for making a business successful. In fact, according to a recent survey, 61% of marketers say improving SEO and growing their organic presence is their top inbound marketing priority. This is just one of the many skills you'll learn in Udemy's digital marketing course. Other topics include driving traffic and sales with YouTube; increasing Twitter followers; and getting likes on Facebook without paying for advertising.\n\n3. Artificial intelligence\n\nOver the past few years, artificial intelligence has officially hit the mainstream, with everything from smartphones to digital assistants incorporating the technology. That ubiquity has resulted in more job opportunities in this area: Since 2013, the number of US jobs requiring AI skills has grown 4.5 times. But understanding AI means combining data science, machine learning, and deep learning to create AI for real-world applications. Udemy offers several courses in AI\u2014 ranging from beginner skills to advanced classes in which you'll learn how to build an AI.\n\n4. Data science\n\nGlassdoor recently cited data scientist as the best job in America\u2014 and with good reason as it has an average base salary of $139,840. There are so many different skills under the data science umbrella \u2014 from programming to statistics and math to data visualization \u2014 that for those who choose to study it, the possibilities are endless. Udemy's classes in data science run from basic to advanced and cover the highs and lows of a career in this field, including corrupt data, anomalies, and irregularities. This gives students the best training and most accurate picture of this career.\n\n5. Photoshop\n\nEven if you're not a professional designer or photographer, knowing how to use Photoshop is a valuable skill to have. Most jobs require employees to make a presentation at some point, and it helps for them to be well designed and incorporate dynamic images. From a Photoshop crash course to a masterclass, Udemy offers courses for all skill levels. But no matter which you choose to take, you'll be taking a step toward impressive presentations.\n\n6. Media training\n\nMedia training is most useful for executives and others who are routinely interviewed by print, online, and TV journalists. But learning how to articulate a thought clearly and concisely is a skill that can transfer to anyone who wants to communicate effectively. That can mean giving a presentation at work or making a sales pitch to a potential client.

But when it comes to marketing, the startup wants to make sure that every dollar of its advertising spend is working as effectively as possible.\n\nParachute is one of a growing number of direct-to-consumer brands that are not only flipping the business models of big brands, but also the advertising industry. Unlike traditional marketers that love to focus on award-winning creative for TV ads, direct-to-consumer brands are laser-focused on data and use sophisticated tactics to analyze granular reams of data to figure out which ads are most effective at getting someone to either buy something, or visit a website, after seeing an ad.\n\nThat requires a new type of business model that largely centers around in-house teams tasked with creating the bulk of advertising for direct-to-consumer brands, and leaning on agencies and tech partners for project-based work.\n\nAt the same time, marketing clouds like Adobe, Salesforce, and Oracle are on a battle to either acquire or build out powerful tech stacks that help brands store and manage their data and then use it to run and measure targeted marketing campaigns.\n\nRead more: A new type of ad agency is catering to brands born on digital channels - and industry giants need a plan\n\nBut as direct-to-consumer brands continue to grow, the tension between building out cheaper tech and marketing expertise in-house versus working with big software companies is starting to play out, according to a dozen interviews with DTC brands, marketing clouds, agencies, and consultants.\n\n\"We abide by the philosophy that any of the touch points to interact with customers needs to be built out in house \u2014customer service, marketing, tech is in house,\" said Luke Droulez, CMO of Parachute. \"Within CRM and planning, it ultimately is better to tailor make a solution that fits your business model \u2014 the issue is plugging into a Salesforce or an Oracle at this stage in our business would be quite expensive.\"\n\nStill, marketing cloud execs are salivating over direct-to-consumer brands and the opportunity to help data-minded marketers organize their stats and run targeted campaigns.\n\nAccording to research from Salesforce and Deloitte Digital, the average brand uses 39 pieces of technology to handle its so-called consumer engagement.\n\n\"A lot of these new brands didn't inherit an existing marketing organization, structure, or organizational design. Many of these teams built their marketing, advertising, loyalty, CRM data business all tightly aligned,\" said Dave Helmreich, group VP of Oracle Marketing Cloud.\n\nAs a result, many DTC brands built out their technology stacks in-house. As they grow, the pitch from marketing clouds is that they need deep technology chops to help them scale in the market, which they can't get from building their own technology in-house, Helmreich said.\n\nThat can result in a few different models: An \"all-in\" model where brands put all of their technology stack into a marketing cloud, or a hybrid model where brands lean on several tech companies to power different portions of their technology stack and house it within a marketing cloud.\n\n\"They realize when they're getting to significant scale [and] large market footprint, they need an enterprise solution \u2014 many of these companies grow up from engineering and very technical backgrounds,\" he said. \"We see fewer and fewer companies spending their engineering time building tools that exist in the market. They tend to spend that time focused on things that they can control and that actually is of unique value to them and that's in order management and creative.\"\n\nDollar Shave Club, for example, recently picked Adobe's Advertising Cloud as its \"primary demand-side platform\" (or DSP) and plans to use more of the marketing cloud company's tools to handle programmatic advertising, according to Adweek.\n\nDirect-to-consumer brands have been a hot topic recently for media M&A banker Terry Kawaja and CEO of Luma Partners. He gave a talk about the rise of direct-to-consumer brands at the Association of National Advertisers' Masters of Marketing Conference last month about how young direct-to-consumer brands are quickly growing without a lot of capital.\n\n\"They sure as heck come to the table far more sophisticated in the martech side of things,\" he said. \"That's what's attracting the cloud guys.\"\n\nHere's a chart that shows how big the DTC industry is, according to Luma Partners:\n\nThe landscape of direct-to-consumer brands Luma Partners\n\nKawaja said part of the reason why marketing clouds have their sights set on direct-to-consumer brands is because \"it's a sexy category,\" meaning they can build out case studies with direct-to-consumer brands. The companies' pitch \"goes a lot further when it's a DTC brand,\" he said.\n\nMarketers are balancing working with partners versus working in-house\n\nDirect-to-consumer brands are notorious for handling their advertising and marketing in-house, partly because of the cost of outsourcing technology and the lack of ability to create custom tech stacks with individual pieces of technology.\n\nMatt Prohaska, CEO and principal of Prohaska Consulting, added that it can be tough for brands to stitch all of their technology together when going all-in on one marketing cloud. Such deals look \"smart on paper but it's always hard to get the integration down,\" he said.\n\nDollar Shave Club competitor and grooming brand Harry's does not use a single marketing cloud, said Pete Christman, head of acquisition marketing.\n\nHarry's marketing is split between three internal teams: A direct-to-consumer team handles acquisition efforts, a retail group focuses on shopper marketing, and an omnichannel team oversees the brand's marketing across its business. Within the direct-to-consumer team, a group of five is specifically focused solely on growth, which occasionally works with partners but tries to handle the bulk of work in-house.\n\n\"We do have a tech stack that we've built up over time, but we don't work with a single partner that's a full-service marketing cloud provider,\" Christman said. \"Instead, we think about the different types of tech that support the type of marketing that we're doing [that] is going to pay for itself.\"\n\nIn one example, Harry's built an internal tool that allows the brand to test different landing pages and messaging that consumers see after clicking on an ad.\n\n\"In my experience, I found that it's wisest for us not to sign up lots of different tech tools before we're completely confident that adding that tool to our stack will result in improved important performance session,\" he said. \"There's a lot of shiny new things out there and there is a lot of consolidation where a tool that used to just do one thing is now adding dimensions to it that try to account for more of your needs.\"\n\nStartups are scrappier with smaller resources than big brands\n\nChristman is not alone in resisting a single marketing cloud.\n\nBrandless, which is a direct-to-consumer grocery and home essentials company, also does not use a marketing cloud to house all of its data.\n\n\"I don't quite believe that they work fully through,\" Brandless CMO Aaron Magness told Business Insider. \"My focus is on building a team and then we can worry about tools without relying on someone else's stack.\"\n\nBrandless\n\nPart of the problem with buying into big software packages is that direct-to-consumer brands don't have the same positions as big brands have. A Fortune 500 company, for instance, may have a team dedicated to handling enterprise deals with software companies, said Will Flaherty, VP of growth at Ro.\n\n\"It may be easier [for big brands] because there's a big decision maker who can kind of compel the division to use it,\" he said. \"The truth is, in some ways it's almost easier for an emerging company to kind of pick and choose the components of a tech stack that makes sense for that particular brand.\"\n\nInstead, Flaherty said that the crop of emerging data platforms \u2014 think mParticle or Segment \u2014 help wrangle bits of data together and route it to specific channels.\n\n\"Some of those platforms have made it easier to cobble together a bunch of different services rather than going with the marketing cloud, all-in-one approach,\" he said.\n\nSimilar to how brands are wary to go all-in on one agency, marketers may not want to pour resources into one marketing cloud, particularly for new direct-to-consumer brands that are working to build a brand.\n\n\"It's all over the place and that's because these businesses are being built with marketing talent at various levels \u2014 it's kind of the Wild West for the marketing clouds,\" said JB Osborne, CEO and cofounder of Red Antler, an agency that specializes in working with startups and direct-to-consumer brands. \"It's very different than large companies who are mostly worried about creating standards and consistency and getting everyone to do the same thing at the right time and the right way. With startups, it's inherently messy and scrappy regardless of the exact scale of the business.\"\n\nBrands are forking over parts of their technology to tech companies though\n\nHowever, there are certain big parts of business that brands do want to outsource, like analytics, or an e-commerce platform to power their website.\n\nThe direct-to-consumer makeup brand Milk Makeup works with Salesforce's commerce cloud to run its e-commerce site, for example. The brand treats its website similar to a real-time platform to upload and test content instead of relying on a web developer.\n\n\"We're changing our homepages and banners on a daily basis,\" said Morgan Fleming, senior director of e-commerce at Milk Makeup. \"Customers are visiting more pages on our site, the sessions are longer and they're spending more time on our product pages.\"\n\nMilk Makeup is an example of a larger trend that Salesforce is seeing where brands hand off the reins to a technology partner to free up time for longer-term priorities like making products or figuring out distribution logistics.\n\nThe pricing model for powering websites is based on the percentage of e-commerce sales for the brand using a gross merchandising value model.\n\n\"There's so much competition and what brands are looking for is agility to stay one step ahead of the customer and two steps ahead of their competition,\" said Rob Garf, VP of industry strategy and insights at Salesforce. \"We have found that with a more unified approach \u2014 not just in marketing \u2014 in the entire journey, we're finding companies enabling a lot more agility by simplifying their technology environments, consolidating consumer data, and being able to unlock that data and make it actionable.\"\n\nDTC brands are struggling to make Facebook work\n\nFor many direct-to-consumer brands, they built their business on Facebook ads that targeted specific segments of consumers.\n\nAs Facebook's algorithm and ad prices have changed though, many are experimenting with more traditional types of advertising like print, TV, and billboards.\n\n\"Most brands now are wary of being too reliant on Facebook or are finding it harder to make Facebook work the way that it did before,\" said Red Antler's Osborne. \"Most businesses are spending the majority of their money on advertising with Facebook and Google, but that's just the landscape today \u2014 they're actively trying to find as many alternative channels and ways to reach customers.\"\n\nThat means that direct-to-consumer brands are dependent on data from the walled gardens of Facebook and Google, which are notoriously hard for third parties like marketing clouds to measure. If they continue to shift money away from Facebook and Google, DTC brands may find that they need to work more closely with a marketing cloud than they do now, said Sam Appelbaum, general manager of Yellowhammer, a specialist ad agency that primarily works with direct-to-consumer brands.\n\n\"Martech allows for horizontal insights across all of your marketing and media [but] is less effective when the integrations with those platforms are not as tight,\" he said. \"It could be that as direct-to-consumer brands rely less on something like Facebook to drive business, these solutions will make more sense for them.\"", "LONDON \u2014 Theresa May has finally published the full text of her 585-page Brexit deal.\n\nThe deal, agreed to by the prime minister and her Cabinet on Wednesday evening, sets out how Britain will withdraw from its relationship with the European Union.\n\nRead Theresa May's draft Brexit withdrawal agreement in full here, and read the accompanying framework for the future relationship between the EU and UK here.\n\nUnder the deal:\n\nThe whole of the UK will remain within the EU customs union.\n\nNorthern Ireland will remain within parts of the EU single market.\n\nThere will be no fixed end date to that arrangement.\n\nThe UK will not be able to withdraw unilaterally from that arrangement.\n\nAn independent panel will rule on when the measure can end.\n\nThe Brexit transition period can be extended beyond December 31, 2020, if there is still no agreement on a future relationship.\n\nMay's ministers backed her Brexit deal with the EU after a mammoth meeting of her Cabinet which lasted more than five hours.\n\nMay did not receive unanimous support from her Cabinet for a deal, which was not put to a vote among Cabinet members.\n\nIn a statement at Downing Street, May said her Cabinet had held a \"long, detailed, and impassioned debate\" but collectively agreed to go ahead with the deal.\n\nShe said the government had faced a choice between \"this deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws, and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security, and our union, or leave with no deal or no Brexit at all.\"\n\nThe prime minister added: \"I believe that what I owe to this country is to take decisions that are in the national interest. And I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"there will be difficult days ahead\" as she seeks support for the deal.\n\nThe agreement will now pass to a special Brexit summit of EU leaders, expected in the final week of November, before returning to the UK Parliament in early December.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told journalists that the agreement was \"a decisive, crucial step in concluding these negotiations.\"\n\nA Brexit 'backstop'\n\nGetty\n\nThe UK has agreed to be bound by a UK-wide Brexit \"backstop\" which will effectively keep Britain in a customs union with the EU if the prime minister fails to secure an alternative arrangement before the end of the two-year Brexit transition period.\n\nMay believes the backstop measure \u2014 designed to be temporary \u2014 is necessary because it will ensure that no new checks emerge at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, something seen as vital to preserving the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement.\n\nBut ministers and backbenchers are concerned because the arrangement would leave the UK without the ability to strike independent free-trade deals and subject to EU rules and regulations despite having no role in its legislation.\n\nThey are also concerned that the EU would seek to make the supposedly temporary arrangement permanent, a concern which appears to have been bolstered by a leaked briefing from Sabine Weyand, the EU's deputy Brexit negotiator, who reportedly told EU ambassadors that UK-wide membership in the customs union should be \"the basis of the future relationship.\"\n\nIn other words, it looks as if the EU would aim to keep the UK in a customs union permanently, something to which all Brexiteers \u2014 and many Remainers \u2014 are implacably opposed.", "Black Friday is one of the biggest shopping events of the year for budget-conscious consumers.\n\nThe allure of marked-down electronics and the hottest toys of the season often draws huge crowds to stores on the Friday after Thanksgiving.

The acquisition of New York broker dealer ITG for $1 billion, which Virtu announced last week, could position the firm for success in those businesses. It's not its first large deal. In 2017, the firm acquired KCG which opened Virtu up to global quant strategies in equities and futures.\n\nThat acquisition was viewed widely on Wall Street as a success.\n\nAs for the ITG acquisition, which is set to close in early 2019, there are concerns about conflicts of interest. Specifically, market observers are worried about Virtu's stock trading business \u2014 which trades the firm's capital \u2014 peeking into its new broker-dealer business and using that information to trade against clients.\n\nIts an issue that's important to CEO Doug Cifu who said in an interview that the firm is building a committee of global clients to oversee the firm to ensure that data is protected. Cifu also spoke about the firm's future plans for growth and its unique military culture.\n\nFrank Chaparro: Let's get into the reasoning behind the deal. It appears to be part of the game plan to build out the client-facing brokerage business? And what's the logic behind entering that market?\n\nDoug Cifu: Our agency execution services took a huge step forward with our acquisition of KCG in 2017 and our agreement to buy ITG is a natural next step in further expanding our transparent global technology and liquidity solutions for our clients.\n\nThis is the first time a broker has applied performance and scaled financial technology to a traditional brokerage model; this is what banks and brokers had been trying to do. Clients benefit by using the same DNA that we use and develop for ourselves, and ITG's products and offerings will be enriched with the same.\n\nAs I've said publicly, ITG's key offerings comprise a complete suite of agency execution services, including liquidity sourcing, trading algorithms, single stock and program trading, workflow technology, and trading analytics - products and services that its clients rely on to manage their day-to-day operations, risk management and fiduciary responsibilities. Each of ITG's businesses operate in areas that utilize trading technologies which are core to Virtu's businesses and stand to benefit from our common R&D and shared technology plant.\n\nChaparro: What does the deal say about the market for high-frequency trading firms in your opinion?\n\nCifu: The KCG and ITG deals further demonstrate the difference between what most folks consider \"HFT\" and the market's appreciation for the value an electronic market maker like Virtu, who competes to provide risk transference services, brings to the financial markets.\n\nI think the deal also highlights the importance of scale and the role that scaled operators like Virtu will play in future consolidation. As our markets continue to become more connected and more competitive, scale is essential to compete in our technology driven financial services markets. Because of the robust competition in the marketplace and the demand from clients for cutting edge technology, firms like ours must continually invest in technology and talent. In order to operate profitably in this environment, it becomes necessary to operate at significant scale.\n\nChaparro: Are there any other areas the firm is interested in exploring to build out, either organically or through another acquisition?\n\nCifu: The ITG combination gives us a slate of organic growth opportunities. As combined firms, Virtu and ITG have built incredible franchises with very complementary products and geographies. While these businesses are distinct and unique from what Virtu does today, they revolve around a common technology infrastructure - like the one I was just describing. For example, I'm excited to offer Virtu's expertise and access to the global FX markets across ITG's suite of execution services, workflow technology and analytics franchises.\n\nOur first order of business is to take the great ITG products, Analytics, Workflow Technology, and Commission Management Aggregation products and invest in them, and of course, we're going to enhance safeguards and transparency around the protection of client data.\n\nI can't overstate how important it is to me personally that client information is properly protected and, to that end, we're talking to the buy-side about establishing a client data governance committee made up of clients from all over the globe to assist in the oversight, design, implementation, and integrity of logical and physical barriers. It's still early and we are engaging the buy-side, getting their input, but the idea is that clients would oversee the management of their data and be empowered to recommend and engage an outside auditing firm and the meetings will be open to the all clients.\n\nThe committee concept is an extension of our history of always pushing for more transparency and using technology to deliver more transparency. This is a good thing - no other firm gives this much transparency to its clients into how their information is protected.\n\nChaparro: Virtu is known for its unique company culture (hard work ethic, military-esque, virtuous). What's your best piece of advice for the ITG employees who will join after the acquisition for finding success at the firm?\n\nCifu: That's a good question, our culture is a bit unique and it's something we're quite proud of. I'd say, don't worry about titles or who you report to, we're not big fans of titles or org charts at Virtu. Titles and org charts tend to make people think and work in silos, which is not who we are. Virtu is a meritocracy that rewards folks who can identify opportunities, propose and implement solutions, and lead others by example to improve the firm.\n\nFrank Chaparro is a senior correspondent at The Block, a cryptocurrency and blockchain news site.

But then, SAP made Qualtrics a massive all-cash offer that the Qualtrics board just couldn't refuse.\n\nOn Sunday, SAP announced it would acquire the Utah-based cloud software company for $8 billion. Qualtrics was originally set to follow its competitor SurveyMonkey, which went public in September. Qualtrics had planned to raise $424 million to $495 million had the IPO taken place, and would have been valued at $4.8 billion at its mid-range price.\n\nQualtrics is a fast-growing, profitable company that had earned nearly $300 million in its last fiscal year. The IPO roadshow, where Qualtrics was pitching institutional investors, was going so well with so many investors wanting in, that Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith hinted shares would likely have been priced higher than its initial range, he told Business Insider. That means that the company would likely have started its IPO day valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nRead more: Meet the CEO who once turned down a $500 million offer for his startup \u2014 and just sold it for $8 billion\n\nEven so, by selling to SAP for $8 billion instead, all of Qualtrics stakeholders arguably walked away a lot wealthier. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019.\n\nBusiness Insider doesn't know exactly how much each of Qualtrics' investors and cofounders made in the sale, but according to regulatory filings and one source familiar with the company, the largest owners of the company were the Smith family who had a 45.5% stake, followed by its venture capitalist investors, Accel with 16%, Insight Venture Partners with 15% and Sequoia with 9%.\n\nQualtrics is a family business founded in 2002 by brothers Ryan Smith and Jared Smith, their father Scott Smith, and Stuart Orgill. It had different classes of shares, with its founders and investors holding preferred stock. We don't know if Qualtrics' preferred stock commanded a higher share price from SAP than its common stock. We only know the total amount SAP paid, $8 billion.\n\nStill, just for fun, we did some back-of-envelop math anyway based on the assumption that all shares got an equal slice of the $8 billion.

The problem was that I was at my highest-ever weight, and I didn't look or feel good in anything I owned.

All told, I was about 40 pounds over my ideal weight.\n\nIt was time to make a change \u2014 a lasting change. I was tired of trying fad diets and watching my weight yo-yo. I decided to lose weight the old-fashioned way: diet and exercise.\n\nBut I had an ace up my sleeve: an app that counts calories and provides nutritional advice. A friend of mine had used MyFitnessPal (made by Under Armour) with great success, and it immediately came to mind when I made the decision to diet.\n\nTracking calories with MyFitnessPal\n\nMyFitnessPal; Chelsea Greenwood/Business Insider\n\nThe day after my birthday, I downloaded the MyFitnessPal app, filled out its survey with my current weight and goals, and started keeping track of every calorie I ate. I also committed to working out five or six days a week for an hour at a time on my stationary bike.\n\nAt first, counting calories was hard. I kept forgetting to log snacks \u2014 which made me realize I was snacking too much \u2014 and had trouble meeting my daily calorie goal of 1,200. Considering I'm a writer and math-averse, it was also difficult to figure out the calorie content of foods I'd prepared myself. (Boxed foods are easy, though, because you can just scan the barcode with the app, and it logs all the nutrition info.)\n\nSoon, I got used to tracking my calories \u2014 thanks in part to the regular push notifications from MyFitnessPal to log each meal \u2014 and I started making progress. I lost about eight pounds within the first month and could already see a difference around my midsection. And I don't feel like I'm depriving myself, either.\n\nMyFitnessPal; Chelsea Greenwood/Business Insider\n\nIn addition to being mindful of calories, I pay attention to the fat, carb, and protein content of the foods I'm eating, as noted by MyFitnessPal in a handy pie chart, and adjust accordingly. At one point, I realized my high-protein breakfast sandwich was nearly blowing my daily fat allotment before 9 a.m. and immediately made a switch.\n\nThe app alerts you when you're nearing your fat, carb, sugar, or sodium limit for the day so you can try to avoid foods laden with those for the rest of the day.

And I firmly believe, with my head and my heart, that this is a decision which is in the best interests of our entire United Kingdom.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"there will be difficult days ahead\" as she seeks support for the deal.\n\nThe agreement, which you can read in full here, will now pass to a special Brexit summit of EU leaders, expected in the final week of November, before returning to the UK Parliament in early December.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told journalists that the agreement was \"a decisive, crucial step in concluding these negotiations.\"\n\nUnder the deal:\n\nThe whole of the UK will remain within the EU customs union.\n\nNorthern Ireland will remain within parts of the EU single market.\n\nThere will be no fixed end date to that arrangement.\n\nThe UK will not be able to withdraw unilaterally from that arrangement.\n\nAn independent panel will rule on when the measure can end.\n\nThe Brexit transition period can be extended beyond December 31, 2020, if there is still no agreement on a future relationship.\n\nThe prime minister will struggle to win support for her deal in Parliament.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group, an anti-EU group of backbenchers, told Tory MPs on Wednesday evening that he \"can not support the proposed agreement in Parliament and would hope that Conservative MPs would do likewise.\"\n\nHe said the deal \"would treat Northern Ireland differently than the rest of the UK\" and \"lock us into an EU customs union.\"\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, also signalled that it would not vote for the deal. Its leader, Arlene Foster, was due to meet with May late Wednesday.\n\nConservative Brexiteers plot to oust May\n\nGetty\n\nAs ministers met in Downing Street, rumours swirled in Westminster that May could face a vote of no confidence from furious pro-Brexit MPs.\n\nLaura Kuenssberg, the BBC's political editor, described a senior Tory as saying that \"Brexiteer anger\" was \"so high that seems likely there will be a call for no confidence vote tomorrow.\"\n\nThere were other reports of multiple letters of no confidence being sent to Conservative authorities on Wednesday evening, though it remained unclear whether the 48-letter threshold for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister would be met.\n\nGraham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives to whom MPs must address their letters, is forbidden from disclosing how many he has received.\n\nA Conservative MP told Business Insider that \"the truth is nobody knows\" whether there will be a challenge from Conservative Brexiteers, adding, \"There is definitely a lot of noise from them, but not really sure how many of them are true Brexit purists willing to risk the government and even Brexit itself.\"\n\nConservative Brexiteer Conor Burns told LBC that there was \"a lot of febrile talk\" among Conservative MPs.\n\n\"What I can tell you is there's no orchestrated attempt to put letters in,\" Burns said. \"But sensing the levels of frustration and annoyance colleagues are feeling it would not surprise me if organically letters are going in.\"\n\nOne factor is the party rulebook, which states that if a challenge were to fail then Conservative MPs would have to wait a full year before mounting another.\n\nThe nearly 600-page draft deal covers the nature of Britain's withdrawal from the EU as well as the framework for Britain's future relationship with the EU.\n\nUnder the agreement, the UK agrees to be bound by a UK-wide Brexit \"backstop\" which will effectively keep Britain in a customs union with the EU if the prime minister fails to secure an alternative arrangement before the end of the two-year Brexit transition period.", "Fight attendants are frequently exposed to disease and contaminants.

And some rich Manhattanites pay up to $800 a day for a baby nurse to teach their newborns to sleep through the night.\n\nOcasio says the company doesn't specialize in such extreme requests as the In-N-Out private jet delivery, however.\n\n\"While a lot of our competitors our there are talking about 24/7 concierge, accessing the inaccessible, giving you everything you want, you know, 'the answer's always yes,' I found that Luxury Attach\u00e9 really set themselves up with offering what we could deliver,\" he said.\n\nRead more:A luxury travel company says these are the 10 most extravagant requests it's had from its super-rich customers\n\nLuxury Attach\u00e9 is a business-to-business concierge service provider that operates in luxury residential buildings and commercial spaces primarily in New York City, but also in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, Boston, and Fort Lauderdale.

Bush have a surprisingly warm friendship, especially for a pair who hold different worldviews in a time of deep partisan and cultural divisions.\n\nIn recent years, Obama has repeatedly praised her husband's predecessor, even calling Bush her \"partner in crime.\" And a few public moments of affection the two have shared have gone viral.\n\nIn a Wednesday interview with Bush's daughter, Jenna Bush Hager of NBC News, Obama called the former president \"a beautiful, funny, kind, sweet man,\" though she added, \"I don't know that I agree with him on everything.\"\n\nBush Hager said the feeling is mutual.\n\n\"I got a text from my dad this morning that said, 'Send Michelle my love,'\" she told Obama.\n\nObama said that the relationship is evidence that what separates Republicans and Democrats is disagreement on policy, not fundamental differences of character.\n\n\"We've become a culture where the nasty sells,\" Obama said. \"But the truth is much more complicated and complex than that. And I'd love if we as a country could get back to the place where we didn't demonize people who disagreed with us.\"\n\nShe went on, \"We're all Americans. We all care about our family and our kids, and we're trying to get ahead. We have different ideas about what's the best way to get there. You know? But that doesn't make me evil.

But some activists say toxic chemicals from Santa Susana likely contaminated the surrounding smoke and ash.\n\nIn the 1940s, the US government began using Santa Susana to test nuclear weapons and rockets. The facility spans more than 2,800 acres on the border of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. A partial nuclear meltdown in 1959 caused radioactive material and carcinogens to contaminate the surrounding soil and groundwater, and some reports say the meltdown released more radioactive material than any other nuclear accident in US history.\n\nIn a Friday statement, the Department of Toxic Substances Control said its scientists and toxicologists \"reviewed information about the fire's location and do not believe the fire has caused any releases of hazardous materials that would pose a risk to people exposed to the smoke.\"\n\nA follow-up statement released Tuesday said staff members had tested the site over the weekend and did not find elevated levels of radiation. The department said it would conduct more air and soil testing over the next several days.\n\nA group of physicians says the damage to Santa Susana could affect residents' health\n\nSome activists are concerned that the area surrounding Santa Susana may not be not safe for residents. Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, a group that advocates for the elimination of nuclear and environmental threats, says the fire likely released toxins into the air.\n\n\"We know what substances are on the site and how hazardous they are,\" Dr. Robert Dodge, the organization's president, said in a statement. \"These toxic materials are in SSFL's soil and vegetation, and when it burns and becomes airborne in smoke and ash, there is real possibility of heightened exposure for area residents.\"\n\nA 1997 study found that workers at the Santa Susana site had elevated rates of cancer in connection with nuclear activity at the complex. If radioactive particles were released into the air, it is possible that similar health effects could be observed among nearby residents.\n\nHowever, Kai Vetter, a professor of nuclear engineering at University of California Berkeley, told the Los Angeles Times that the health effects of smoke inhalation are greater than any potential danger from radioactive particles in the air.\n\n\"Although there is a possibility that radioactive materials \u2014 accounted for or not \u2014 could be dispersed through the fire and the smoke plume, the risk for health effects due to radiation is expected to be small,\" Vitter said.\n\nThis Feb. 12, 2009 photo shows buildings at the old Rocketdyne facility, the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, in the Simi Valley area near Los Angeles. Reed Saxon/AP\n\nThe physicians' group also criticized the California Department of Toxic Substances Control for having \"no public confidence,\" and pointed out that state lawmakers commissioned an independent review panel in 2015 to monitor the department's public outreach, fiscal management, and enforcement of hazardous-waste laws. The clean-up process at Santa Susana has faced delays\n\nMost of the Santa Susana site is owned by Boeing, though NASA oversees one area and the US Department of Energy leases a portion as well. A Boeing spokeswoman told the Los Angeles Times that more than 50% of the company's property at Santa Susana burned.\n\nA 2007 order instructed the three parties to finish cleaning up the site by 2017, but those clean-up efforts have repeatedly hit delays. In August, the Ventura County Star reported another delay: an action plan that was supposed to come out in the first half of 2019 is now behind schedule.\n\nThese delays have drawn backlash from local community members. Last year, a group of parents called for tougher clean-up standards, claiming their children's cancer diagnoses were linked to the nuclear research site. The group delivered a petition with more than 17,000 signatures to state officials.\n\nInvestigators have not yet determined what caused the Woolsey Fire. Last week, however, utility company Southern California Edison told state regulators that an outage was reported at one of its substations a few minutes before the fire began. The outage was in the same area where Woolsey broke out; in fact, the substation is located within the Santa Susana complex.\n\nRead more: Before-and-after photos show the devastating destruction in Malibu as the California wildfires rage on\n\nSouthern California Edison spokesman Steve Conroy told the Los Angeles Times that the company is required to file a report whenever an incident may be connected to another event.\n\n\"The report is preliminary,\" Conroy said. \"We have no other information other than a line went out of service and we don't know why.\"\n\nThe Woolsey Fire has killed two people and burned through more than 150 square miles.", "Over on The Cut, associate managing editor Catie L'Heureux has some great advice for emailing your very busy boss.\n\nSimply put, start the email with a question like, \"Do you think\u2026\" or \"Could we\u2026\" or \"Will you confirm\u2026\"\n\nThat way, your boss can reply \"yes\" or \"no,\" and doesn't have to read \u2014 or pretend to read \u2014 a novel-length missive just to learn that you need an extension on a project deadline.\n\nRead more: Mark Cuban says he has 3 smartphones and receives about 700 emails every day\n\nHere's one of L'Heureux's examples: \"Could we please pay X freelancer the usual $Y to complete Z task?

Business Insider previously reported on similar advice from Jocelyn Glei, author of \"Unsubscribe: How to Kill Email Anxiety, Avoid Distractions, and Get Real Work Done.\"\n\n\"If you're asking a question, propose a solution,\" Glei wrote. \"Messages that offer nothing but a question like \u2014 What do you think about X?\u2014 are generally ineffectual. Busy people don't want to figure out your problems for you, and they don't want to write you a lengthy response.\"\n\nAllison Green, who writes the \"Ask a Manager\" column, also recommends taking full advantage of the subject line. Two examples she gives are: \"TO APPROVE: September mailing draft (need by July 15)\" and \"are we ready to make Craig Jones an offer?\"\n\nThen again, sometimes you need more than a quick \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nIf you're stuck on a project and absolutely can't proceed without your boss' guidance, The Muse's Kat Boogaard recommends sending your boss an email that says: you're stuck, you've tried these two tactics, and you'd like to sit down with them on this day to talk it over. (The full template appears in The Muse article.)\n\nOn The Cut, L'Heureux also shares some tips for replying to your boss' emails. If your boss writes, \"Will you do X?\" you'd be wise to write back something like, \"Of course. I can email it to you by 3 p.m.: a single page focusing on X, Y, and Z. Does that sound right?\"\n\nAgain, it's all about making it easy for your boss to respond and for you to get the information you need.

Investor confidence has been shaken and the company's bonds are taking a hit.\n\nTrading on November 13 saw the company's 4.4% 2035 bond fall 2.5% on the back of news that the company was selling a portion of its stake in Baker Hughes, an oil field servicing company. This decline came even as GE shares rose following the announcement.\n\nThis contrast with the company's shares is important as the company's future borrowing cost is linked to its bond yield.

The move is part of a series of actions the company said it was taking on Tuesday to make its sleek, flash-drive-like products less appealing to young people ahead of an expected regulatory crackdown on e-cigs. Right now, Juul is the top e-cig brand in the US, making up nearly 80% of the e-cig market.\n\nJuul will also temporarily stop selling some of its flavored varieties in stores, with the exception of mint \u2014 a flavor that remains available as menthol in traditional cigarettes.\n\nJuul has done a significant amount of marketing on social media. According to one recent study, its advertisements on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram \u2014 platforms known to be popular among young people \u2014 were a smash hit. Juul said on Tuesday that it will not delete its Twitter or YouTube accounts but will confine the content posted on both of those channels to materials about quitting smoking and customer support.\n\nBut Juul's social media presence began years ago, and the results of that campaign, which flourished, may now be difficult to rein in.\n\nA 2016 Juul ad. An ad on Juul's website from 2016.\n\nAccording to researchers, Juul stood out from other e-cigarette brands by advertising predominantly on social media as opposed to places like billboards or magazines.

He had been working as a successful exec at Google before his brother prodded him into joining Qualtrics instead.\n\nDespite a career full of success, Smith told Business Insider back in 2016 that he doesn't like to work, \"as a matter of principle.\" He likes to travel.\n\nStill, he's so good at what he does \u2014 building tech products and managing people \u2014 that companies from startups to Google have begged him to work for them, turning him first into a millionaire and, as of Sunday, a billionaire, almost in spite of himself.\n\nTeen tech star\n\nHis phenomenal career story began when he was in high school in Utah.\n\nHe got an internship at word-processing-software maker WordPerfect, which was bought by Novell. He worked his way up to product manager by age 18.\n\nBut Microsoft was killing Novell, so Novell hired Eric Schmidt as CEO. That's when the teenage Smith first met him.\n\nAlthough Schmidt didn't end up saving Novell, he did give it a few years of breathing room. Then Novell began tanking again, and Smith quit his high-paying job to go to college in London, studying economics.\n\nQualtrics cofounder Jared Smith. Business Insider While in London he learned he was a \"horrible\" driver. So after he graduated, he took a job in a startup called Juice Software in New York, just to live in a city where he wouldn't have to drive.\n\nJuice was started by Kim Scott (who would later lure him to Google). The company designed software for the financial-services industry.\n\nIt launched on September 10, 2001.\n\nThe next day was 9/11. New York was in tatters, as was Smith's apartment, which was near the World Trade Center towers.\n\nUltimately, the company bounced back and was sold to Microsoft. But as soon as he could \u2014 and before it was sold \u2014 Smith left New York to decompress. He spent a year hitchhiking around South America.\n\nHaving hitchhiked around Africa in college, he was an \"incredibly seasoned traveler\" who wasn't afraid of dangerous situations, he said. Still, his trip ended in Caracas, Venezuela, when he got caught in the \"oil riots and coup against [then President] Chavez. It was really tense,\" he said. \"Tear gas in the plazas and everything else.\"\n\nIt was time to go home to Utah.\n\nA new product and a fistfight\n\nBack home, his dad, BYU professor Dr. Scott Smith, had been diagnosed with cancer. The prognosis wasn't good. His younger brother, Ryan, had moved home to be with his dad. They were working in the basement \"twiddling around on a survey product,\" and they asked Smith to help them sell it.\n\nHe looked at the product, declared it \"worthless\" and built them a new version, which would ultimately become the product used by millions of people and lead the company to big profits and a big valuation.\n\nQualtrics brothers and cofounders CEO Ryan Smith and COO Jared Smith. Qualtrics He also convinced Ryan to change the name of the company to Qualtrics, from a variety of product names it was using. \"Ryan and I got in a fistfight at a restaurant over that,\" he laughed.\n\nThe brothers and cofounders are opposites in every way; they disagree often, but they rarely come to blows.\n\nThey usually fight, dig in, and then compromise, he said. \"Normally, in every argument we're both right.\"\n\nMeanwhile, his dad made a miraculous recovery thanks to the doctors at the Huntsman Cancer Center. (Qualtrics just donated a $1 million to Huntsman and launched the Five for the Fight campaign.)\n\nWith the product built and his dad on the mend, Smith hired the company's first engineer and told his brother he was leaving again.\n\nHe didn't want to work on Qualtrics. That was \"always Ryan's dream,\" he said.\n\nHe wanted to travel. He bought a ticket to New Zealand intending to hitchhike through Asia.\n\nRight before he left, Kim Scott called. She was working for Google and was offering him a job that would change his life, and Qualtrics, forever.\n\nDragged to Google\n\nSmith didn't want to work there. \"I was opposed to work on principal. I was going to go traveling. This tells you how stupid I was,\" he said.\n\nKim Scott. Qualtrics This was the end of 2004, right after the IPO when the stock was trading at under $200 and employees' stock options sold for far less than that.\n\nScott wouldn't give up. She flew him out to Mountain View at Google's expense, where he reluctantly interviewed.\n\n\"I think the only reason I got the job is that I didn't really want the job and they thought I was so humble,\" he says. 'It was like, 'How are you at this?' I was like, 'I suck at this.'\"\n\nFor instance, he says of his programming skills, \"I'm a hacker at best. I have good design skills, but I would not consider myself an engineer. I'm not a computer scientist. I'm an economist. Compared to Google engineers, I would never make it in the engineering department.\"\n\nScott disagrees, calling him a great coder. He saw Google's daunting hiring process as a challenge, and did well, she remembers. And after he was hired, he earned the respect of the Google engineers, who even let him code a few things himself, the first non-engineer at Google given that honor, Scott said.\n\nBut, according to Kim Scott, Smith's real gift is guiding engineers to build products that wowed the business side:\n\nI could go to him with an acorn idea and he would go away for a weekend and come back with the whole oak tree, taking conceptually what I meant, making it look beautiful and actually building it. He gets more work done in a 24-hour period than any other human being I've ever encountered.\n\nFrom Google, to quagmire, to Qualtrics\n\nHe took the job at Google and discovered he didn't fit in, he recalled, thanks to his time at Novell.\n\nDeep Nishar. Business Insider / Matthew Lynley \"I ruffled some feathers,\" he said. \"Google was straightforward and you had to play no games. You just had to use data and be honest. Novell was much more political and all about fiefdoms.\"\n\nWith Scott's help, he learned the Google way and did well. He worked on ad products, then on internal tools for the sales team. He learned how to hire and manage.\n\nHe got stock options, which a New York financial-industry friend advised him not to sell off every month like the other employees did. So he held onto them all.\n\nOne day, he went to lunch with his friend, Deep Nishar, another well-respected product manager. At the end of lunch, Deep asked him to lead Google's products in China.\n\n\"It didn't make sense. How do you lead products if you don't speak the language? So I turned him down. Similarly stupid to turning Kim down,\" Smith said.\n\nDeep was also persistent, and eventually Smith was talked into the China job, working under \"Kai-Fu Lee, the guy we stole from Microsoft,\" he said. (Lee's resignation caused Steve Ballmer to throw a chair at Lee, and declare war on Google and Eric Schmidt, court documents later revealed.)\n\nOnce again, he was scaling an operation from a few people to hundreds, this time in a foreign country.\n\nReuters Under Lee, Google China grew from 9% market share to 30% share \u2014 and to about 900 people, Smith said.\n\nThen Google discovered that hackers, presumably from the government, were attacking Google to help track down dissidents. Google went public about it all, but the PR was terrible all the same.\n\nUnhappy with the situation, Google yanked its operations out of China, moving them to Hong Kong.\n\n\"I had a front-row seat through all of that,\" he remembered. The situation put him, a product manager, in constant contact with some of Google's most senior executives, including Schmidt.\n\nMeanwhile, Qualtrics was taking off, too. It had customers. It was profitable. Ryan now had 40 employees and he was calling Smith regularly for advice, hounding him to quit Google and come back to help at Qualtrics.\n\nRyan pressed: How high did Google's shares have to go before he was willing to sell them all and become wealthy enough to quit Google and come work for his startup? Google had been flirting around the $600 mark.\n\n\"And in a moment of weakness, I gave him the price,\" he says. It was a price that would make Smith financially well off for life.\n\nThe day the shares hit that price, Ryan called Smith. \"I sold all my shares the same day,\" he says. Then Ryan flew out, helped him pack and escorted Smith back to Utah.\n\n'Rude' to VCs\n\nThe truth was the whole China thing had also worn him out. But when he got to the startup, he said, \"I was bored. A 40-person operation, it took me about 20 minutes a day to manage.\"\n\nBut the company \"was a sales machine\" and growing. Soon he was back to hiring and scaling.\n\nVCs had also found Qualtrics and were calling. Ryan was \"rude\" to them, Smith said, and Ryan confirmed. He saw investors like predatory lenders. \"Why would I want to take on a mortgage?\" Ryan Smith remembers telling them. Ryan also turned down a $500 million acquisition offer.\n\nBut eventually Ryan decided that he wanted a board of people who had grown huge tech companies. That meant VCs, and they would want a stake in the company.\n\nSmith hated the idea. \"I thought it was silly to sell any part of the company because it was doing so well, profitably, growing 100% year on year,\" he recalled.\n\nRyan Smith and Jared Smith. Qualtrics So the brothers fought. They dug in. They compromised. \"The detente was if he could raise $100 million, for a small percentage of the company, then we would fund raise,\" Smith said.\n\nRyan got the terms that Smith demanded.\n\nAnd, looking back, Smith said, \"Ryan was incredibly right.\" The cash and the board pushed Qualtrics to grow in new ways. Without it they would have gotten \"fat and lazy,\" satisfied with the old product and the profits it generated, Smith admitted.\n\nAs for the investors, \"They've all done phenomenally well. A dream investment,\" he says.\n\nWhile Qualtrics, a private company, doesn't release revenue, and is officially valued at a billion as of its last raise \u2014 $150 million in 2014, $220 million total raised \u2014 at one point, Smith told attendees at its annual customer conference last month that it was a \"multibillion\" company. It claims over 8,000 customers. In any case, it's still highly profitable.\n\nAs Qualtrics grew, Smith implemented all of the employee-management tools he learned at Google, plus he wrote a few new ones.\n\n\"I really love building systems that transform organizations,\" he said. And since Qualtrics is his company, he's been known to take liberties. \"Imagine Ryan's surprise when one day he walks in and I've coded something that puts all the salespeople on a curve and made it public. That's radical transparency.\"\n\nThe company now has closer to 1,000 employees, including seasoned leaders. It just launched a second generation of survey products and a new set of data-analysis products, retiring the original product Smith built in the basement 12 years ago.\n\nAnd Smith is once again talking about not working.\n\n\"I put all the processes, machinery, and management stuff in place to scale the organization. Ryan is the CEO. I've started to slow down and spend more time at my beach house to give execs more space to work. When I left Google, I thought I was retiring, and I'd like to end up there again,\" he said.\n\nThen again, if Ryan were to call him and insist he take on something new, he could be dragged in, again. \"Everyone knows that eventually I'll get bored.\"", "It's never been a better job market for private equity professionals, with the sector seeing the most active hiring market ever, according to a new report.\n\nIn a survey of 630 North American investment professionals released Tuesday, recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles found that more than half of respondents saw an increase in base salary this year compared with 2017. More than three-quarters of that group saw their base salary increase up to 20%. Managing partners saw the biggest increase, with base compensation up 13.6%, to $768,000.\n\nBonuses are rising, too: 77% of those surveyed said their bonus increased from 2016 to 2017, with 90% reporting an increase of up to 50%.\n\nAs compensation ticks up, so are opportunities to move elsewhere.

Hamas responded with a barrage of about 400 rockets, which in turn prompted Israeli airstrikes that hit a reported 100 militant positions in Gaza.\n\nBoth sides agreed to an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire, ending the barrage in less than 24 hours.\n\nWhile every life lost is tragic, experts recognize that the conflict could have been much worse, and that both sides showed a great deal of restraint in order to prevent all-out war.\n\n\"Every tactical incident has the potential to escalate into a strategic event,\" said Neri Zilber, adjunct fellow for The Washington Institute, in a Tuesday call with reporters. \"There are incentives on both sides to keep the situation quiet.\"\n\nThis calibrated restraint, said Zilber, may be evidenced by a video of an anti-tank missile striking an Israeli military bus near the Gaza border. Dozens of Israeli soldiers had reportedly offloaded just before the missile strike. Zilber emphasized it is difficult to prove whether the missile team watched the bus offload, but this could be an attempt to limit casualties.\n\nZilber said with these types of strikes, Hamas is playing a \"clever game.\"\n\n\"Hamas has learned that Israel and [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu don't really want a war,\" he said.\n\nThe attacks were preceded by a positive week for Gazans, who received the first installation of Qatari financial aid. What will eventually amount to $90 million is meant to improve Gazan infrastructure, and indicates Netanyahu's determination to stem economic collapse in the region, Zilber said.\n\nFor Netanyahu's part, Zilber also said the prime minister knows escalation will harm those efforts, and believes that the only way forward is to ensure that Gazans have something to lose. He says that's why the Israeli leader would so quickly agree to cease fire.\n\nWhat remains unclear is whether \u2014 and for how long \u2014 the Israeli public will \"appreciate that nuance,\" according to Zilber. He suggests pressure may start to build against Netanyahu from the ground up, noting that residents in the Israeli south are already angry with the government for not being more forceful against Hamas after rocket attacks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman resigned, calling the cease-fire a \"capitulation to terror\" and calling for immediate elections to replace the existing government, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nIn a press conference in Paris on Sunday, Netanyahu explained his decision to operate with restraint, saying he is doing \"everything I can to prevent an unnecessary war.\"\n\nAccording to Zilber, whether the most recent cease-fire will last hinges on whether Netanyahu can convince Israelis that reaching an agreement with Hamas is the only way to prevent such a war.", "Not too long ago, if your friend had a smart speaker like Amazon's Alexa or Google's Assistant in their living room, it seemed like a rare novelty.

These apps make it easy to access to your budget on the go and ensure it's always up to date.\n\nSimplify your money goals\n\nWhether you want to pay off your student loans, buy a sports car, or travel the world, focusing on one single goal can help you get there faster.\n\nHaving a firm target will help you feel more in control of your money and resist the temptation to overindulge when the opportunity arises. Plus, you'll already be doing better than most people \u2014 just 34% of Americans set specific financial goals in 2017.\n\nSo instead of spreading your money thin chasing several financial goals this year, consider setting one goal to focus your efforts.\n\nCut back to one credit card\n\nOne of the fastest ways to simplify your finances is getting your wallet down to just one credit card.\n\nThis makes it much easier to review each statement. If you have two or three cards, you're much less likely to go through each and every charge to check for errors. One statement makes that an easier process, saving time and money.\n\nA single credit card also means a single debt balance, which can help focus repayment efforts and get you back in the black sooner.\n\nStart a rainy-day fund\n\nFinancial experts recommend that everyone have a rainy-day fund for when life throws a financial curveball. But so few people actually do it.\n\nA simple way to start saving some money to cover unexpected expenses is to automate your savings. Open a savings account separate from your everyday account, and arrange for a fixed amount to be automatically transferred into it each month.\n\nThis will help ensure that you have something to fall back on if you ever need it.\n\nFind out more about how SIMPLE Mobile can help you make the right financial decisions.\n\nDisclaimer: Please always refer to the latest Terms and Conditions of Service at SimpleMobile.com.

Only Proxima Centauri, a three-star system, is closer.\n\nWhat's more, the newly discovered world is close enough to Earth \u2014 yet far enough from its blindingly bright star \u2014 to be photographed by a new generation of giant telescopes.\n\n\"This is probably the first Earth-sized planet we will directly image by future missions,\" Abel M\u00e9ndez, an astrobiologist at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo who wasn't involved in the study, told Business Insider.\n\nThe new world is known as Barnard's star b or, in other circles, GJ 699 b. The team that found it used more than 20 years' worth of telescope observations, and the data suggests the planet is at least 3.2 times as massive as Earth and has a 233-day year.\n\nThe world appears to orbit in Barnard's star's \"snow line,\" a region just on the edge of the habitable zone, where liquid water can exist on the surface of a planet.\n\nFor that reason, scientists consider the possible planet to be a \"cold super-Earth,\" and some are wondering whether alien life might exist there.\n\nWhat it might be like on Barnard's star b\n\nESO/M. Kornmesser\n\nBarnard's star is not like the sun. It's what astronomers call an M dwarf, meaning it's smaller, cooler (and redder), less massive, and billions of years older.\n\n\"M dwarfs are prime targets for planetary searches, because they favor the detection of small companions,\" or planets, Rodrigo F. D\u00edaz, an astrophysicist at the University of Buenos Aires who wasn't part of the research team, wrote in a Nature \"News and Views\" piece.\n\nThis is because M-dwarf stars are small enough to \"wobble\" when rocky planets orbit them. Such wobbling happens because the gravity of the planet and the star mutually tug at each other. (A planet's orbit is rarely perfectly circular.) Some telescopes can detect this behavior.\n\nBarnard's star b took a long time to find because red dwarf stars often have sunspots, which can throw off sensitive measurements. Pooling together more than two decades' worth of telescope observations, however, helped the research team find the signal of a presumable planet in the noise of Barnard's star's light.\n\nAn illustration showing the sun in relation to Barnard's star and the Alpha Centauri triple-star system. IEEC/Science-Wave/Guillem Ramisa\n\nThe newly discovered planet is about as far from its star as Mercury is from the sun. That's fairly close. But being next to a smaller and cooler star puts Barnard's star b at the edge of the habitable zone.\n\nPractically, this means the surface temperature of Barnard's star b is most likely -150 degrees Celsius. That's cold enough to freeze carbon dioxide into dry ice, let alone water into ice.\n\nBut bone-chilling temperatures don't mean the exoplanet is a dead world bereft of liquid water.\n\nCan a cold super-Earth be habitable?\n\nHalf of Jupiter's icy moon Europa as seen via images taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s. NASA/JPL-Caltech/SETI Institute\n\nThe surface of Europa, an icy moon that orbits Jupiter, is about 10 degrees colder than Barnard's star b. And Enceladus, a smaller icy moon around Saturn, is some 40 degrees colder than Europa.\n\nYet both tiny worlds \u2014 and many more in the solar system\u2014 hide expansive oceans of salt water beneath their crusts. There's also growing evidence that organic molecules are mixed into that liquid too.\n\nThe researchers' estimate of Barnard's star b's temperature also assumes it has no atmosphere. But it very well could.\n\n\"Since the planet is more massive than Earth, it may retain a hydrogen atmosphere,\" Sara Seager, the deputy science director for NASA's TESS mission and an astrophysicist at MIT who wasn't involved in the study, told Business Insider. \"Hydrogen is a potent greenhouse gas and could conceivably keep the surface temperature warm enough for life, if the atmospheric pressure is high enough.\"\n\nIt's not a far-fetched idea. Seager said all planets \u2014 even Earth \u2014 are born with a hydrogen atmosphere. This is because hydrogen is the dominant material in nebulas, the clouds of gas and dust out of which stars (and their planets) form.\n\n\"Assuming it has the estimated minimum mass, then it is probably a rocky or frozen ocean world with a thick atmosphere, maybe like Titan in the solar system,\" M\u00e9ndez said.\n\nOn the other hand, 3.2 Earth masses is a minimum estimate for the new world's size. M\u00e9ndez added that \"its mass could be larger and therefore a mini-Neptune.\"\n\nThe first photo of a rocky exoplanet\n\nA laser on the Thirty Meter Telescope is designed to help the observatory take space-quality images. TMT\n\nAstronomers have already taken photos of very large exoplanets. They're akin to giant Jupiters or failed stars, though, meaning they're all extremely hot, gassy, and uninhabitable.\n\nFuture ground observatories like the European Extremely Large Telescope in Chile, or perhaps even the Thirty Meter Telescope in Hawaii, may be able to capture a small image of Barnard's star b.\n\nAssuming the exoplanet does indeed exist, it may look like a tiny dot or blob in an image. But the data trapped in such a picture could tell scientists whether it's small and rocky like Earth, or big and gassy like Neptune, or somewhere in between.\n\nWhat's more, some of the light that passes through or bounces off the world's atmosphere might even be sampled for indirect signs of life. Such gases might include methane, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and perhaps 14,000 other so-called biosignatures.\n\nRed dwarf stars typically blast out a lot of flares and solar storms, which can harm or destroy planetary atmospheres. They're also very bright in ultraviolet light, which can break down biosignatures. But Seager said Barnard's star, as an M dwarf, is calmer and gives off less UV light \u2014 so its presumable planet may be able to accumulate biosignatures to detectable levels.\n\nBut even if Barnard's star b is a bust for biosignatures, observations may find that it isn't alone.\n\n\"I don't discard the possibility of smaller Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone of Barnard's star,\" M\u00e9ndez said. \"Now we know that Barnard has planets, and there is plenty of space between the star and this new planet for a few small ones.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly described Ganymede as a moon of Saturn; it's a moon of Jupiter. We actually meant to describe Enceladus, which is a moon of Saturn, and regret the error.", "The US will have dished out nearly $6 trillion on the war on terror by October 2019, and there's no end in sight to the convoluted, ill-defined conflict.\n\nAccording to an annual report from the Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs, the total cost of the war on terror will reach roughly $5.9 trillion through fiscal year 2019.\n\nThis is far higher than the Pentagon's official calculation of $1.5 trillion because it goes beyond Defense Department appropriations and includes the cost of \"spending across the federal government that is a consequence of these wars.\"\n\nRead more: The most elite US-trained forces in Afghanistan routed by the Taliban, another sign the war is a lost cause\n\nThe report also factors in war-related spending by the Department of State, past and obligated spending for war veterans' care, interest on the debt incurred to pay for the wars, and the prevention of and response to terrorism by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"If the US continues on its current path, war spending will continue to grow,\" the report states.\n\n\"Even if the wars are ended by 2023, the US would still be on track to spend an additional $808 billion to total at least $6.7 trillion, not including future interest costs,\" the report adds. \"Moreover, the costs of war will likely be greater than this because, unless the US immediately ends its deployments, the number of veterans associated with the post-9/11 wars will also grow.\"\n\nRead more: 'We are losing': Trump and his top advisors aren't publicly admitting how bad things are in Afghanistan\n\n'This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while'\n\nThe war on terror was born out of the 9/11 terror attacks over 17 years ago.\n\n\"This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while,\" former President George W.

That was the first time a solution of this kind had been reported, but according to an Amazon executive, it had been in the works for months.\n\nJay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told The New York Times that the decision to split HQ2 was made during a meeting in August. The team running the search decided that it would be easier to find the 50,000 employees that they intended to hire if they split the office between two locations.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson later told The Times that that decision had been made in September.

Ms. Sullivan and her staff appeared to give each other knowing glances,\" The Journal wrote.\n\nHolly Sullivan is the Amazon exec who led the search for HQ2.\n\nThe Journal first reported that the decision to have two HQ2 locations was related to the company's ability to recruit enough tech talent.\n\nAmazon reiterated this in its blog post announcing the selections on Tuesday.\n\n\"We can recruit more top talent by being in two locations,\" the company said. \"These are fantastic cities that attract a lot of great talent.\"\n\nIt would also allow Amazon to ease issues related to housing and transit.\n\n\"25,000 as a floor is easier for the communities to absorb,\" Carney told The Times.\n\nThese problems have been highlighted at Amazon's main headquarters in Seattle, where locals complain of skyrocketing rents, prolonged construction, gentrification, and gridlock traffic.\n\nRead more about Amazon's HQ2 project:", "Amazon is headed to Queens. After more than year of silent negotiations, the company finally landed on the winners of its second North American headquarters. The new HQ2 will be divided into two sites: the newly-minted National Landing area of Arlington, Virginia, and Long Island City, Queens.\n\nA mere hours after the announcement was made, Citigroup revealed that it was handing over space in a 50-story office building to make way for the retail giant.

The displaced employees will move to alternate locations in Long Island City or transfer to Citigroup's global headquarters in Tribeca. Amazon will introduce 700 employees in the next year, followed by 2,200 employees in 2020.\n\nAccording to Constantine Valhouli, the head of research for NeighborhoodX, the building is a \"natural choice\" for Amazon, given its dominance and height. Amazon's move, he said, could symbolize the growing takeover of West Coast technology companies in New York City, where major office towers have long been occupied by financial firms.\n\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nBut the move is only temporary. Over the next ten years, Amazon will build a 4 million-square-foot headquarters to house its 25,000 new employees. From there, the company will expand the project to around 8 million square feet, accommodating an additional 15,000 workers.\n\nThe entire development is set to be complete in 15 years, at which point Amazon will have spent $3.7 billion on the project.\n\nThat's a hefty price tag, given that the company's parallel development in Arlington.

Its 2017 proposal included flood resiliency measures and plans to preserve the neighborhood's industrial character.\n\nThough Plaxall and Amazon could share a similar wish-list, there's plenty left to determine, including the project timeline, fate of existing businesses, and location of Jeff Bezos's controversial helipad.", "Dealing with a difficult boss or coworker can test your patience and be drag on your productivity.

It will be the Russian-made Soyuz-FG's first crewed flight since Oct. 11, when U.S. astronaut Nick Hague and a Russian cosmonaut landed unharmed on the Kazakh desert steppe after the rocket bound for the International Space Station failed in mid-air two minutes after liftoff.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration has relied on Russian rockets to ferry astronauts to the space station since the United States retired its Space Shuttle program in 2011, though the agency has announced plans for test flights carrying two astronauts on commercial rockets made by Boeing and SpaceX next April.\n\n\"I do see the incident that happened on Oct. 11 with our launch abort not as a failure but as a success,\" McClain told Reuters in a telephone interview from Russia. \"It actually bolsters my confidence in the rocket and in the processes that we have.\n\n\"We're confident in the vehicle and getting back to it,\" McClain said of the Soyuz rocket, which she called \"the workhorse of the space program.\"\n\nAfter lifting off from Kazakhstan's Soviet-era cosmodrome of Baikonur last month, a damaged sensor caused one of the rocket's three booster stages to separate improperly, falling inward on the rocket and jolting it off its ascent two miles above ground, Russian investigators announced earlier this month.\n\nVideo from inside the capsule showed the two men being shaken around at the moment the failure occurred, their arms and legs flailing. Russian cosmonaut Alexei Ovchinin can be heard saying, \"That was a quick flight.\"\n\nThe accident was the first serious launch problem experienced by a crewed Soyuz space mission since 1983, when a crew narrowly escaped before a launchpad explosion.\n\nIn August, a hole appeared in a Soyuz capsule docked to the ISS that caused a brief loss of air pressure and had to be patched.

It's your girl Jackie Aina. Thank you so much for joining me on today's video.\n\n[Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie...]\n\nI would go to makeup counters and one, they'd be frantic. \"Oh my God, the black girl's here. What do we do?\" Or they would just like, \"Oh no, we don't have anything for you.\" Or \"I wouldn't do that on your complexion.\" It was always like being the other. I always felt like I was an 'other' box at the makeup counter.\n\nAnd it was so annoying and so frustrating that I was like, \"You know what, I'm just gonna do this stuff myself and then I'll just show people how to do it on YouTube.\" I'm gonna apply that just directly on my eyelid.\n\nPeople were like \"Oh my god, like who's this black girl? This dark-skinned girl, like she wears color, she wears nude lips, she wears all the trends that we never see on people that look like us,\" you know.\n\nMaybe everyone's gonna have a different opinion on this, but you have to get to where you wanna be first before you can really shake the table, right? So I would talk about it, I was very vocal, but also very mindful. I still wanna have a relationship with brands. I still wanna grow my platform. And the day that I get untouchable basically is when you'll really hear it from me. That's when I will really like use my platform in the way that I really want to, you know.\n\n[Just don't appreciate the blatant erasure of like a whole spectrum of people. Like it doesn't even look like they tried.]\n\nI believe if you're gonna for example, critique brands or you know, talk about the negatives, I think you should also be uplifting black-owned businesses, you know, talking about other minority-owned businesses, you know.\n\n[I'm going to be doing a full face using Muslim-owned beauty brands.]\n\nTo me it's like, I have to kinda sandwich the positive with the negative because ultimately that's the goal is to have more people in positions that look like me, you know, filling seats, working for brands, becoming influencers themselves, being voices that need to be heard, starting businesses.\n\nI don't want to call out everything. I don't feel like I need to be the attack dog of every single incident that takes place online, you know. It's also something that a lot of black women can relate to because people look to us to kind of be like the savior of everything, and it's like this isn't something that we can carry on our backs all the time. Like, we need to collectively as a community, be able to say \"Look, this is not okay, this is wrong.\"\n\nWith respect to the conversation of diversity, this is what's so ironic about the topic now because a lot of people like to say that I kind of talk about diversity as like a marketing ploy, and I'm like, if you only knew, five, even six, not that long ago, I was the one that was being told \"Don't talk about that, it's too niche, it's too specific, white people can't relate to that. Lighter people can't relate to that. Asian people can't relate to that.\" These are things that brands will tell me.

It's like, \"what's with this diversity thing?\" like you know.\n\n[Today we're going to be talking about my favorite foundation line for women of color.]\n\nOf course there's more to talk about than just that. That's not the only thing that my platform is about, but the struggles of colorism don't just affect the black community. They affect the Latin community. They affect Asian communities. They affect Natives. It's something that a lot of people can relate to, as it relates to makeup. Mind you, this is still a makeup channel. So it's like, you know, even though you don't wear the same foundation as me. It doesn't mean you can't enjoy my videos.\n\n[You can handle the dew. Like I don't think I'm ready for this jelly. Now it does, however.]\n\nIt's crazy seeing now the people that look like me are finally getting a chance to break those glass ceilings and actually grow past a certain number on YouTube. Whereas five years ago, it was not happening. I think that a lot of the work and vocalizing that people of color have done on YouTube and social media in general, like I see viral tweets on Twitter all the time of people being like \"This is unacceptable\" from these brands, you know with these foundation shade ranges, and just their diversity and their brands in general.\n\nAll it takes is one Instagram post for a brand to show their new launch, and God forbid it doesn't run darker than like, you know, tan. People will come for them. And brands see that and they've come to understand \"Like, okay, we can't we can't let this slide anymore. We need to make more people visible.\" And I'm not even just talking about as it relates to color. I mean this could also relate to having Muslims in your campaign. You know, I love what Fenty did with having you know, women actually in hijabs in their campaigns. Seeing someone that looks like you is powerful. That to me is a direct reflection of like I'm accepted, I am beautiful. I'm worthy of being seen.\n\nI actually got reached out by Jerrod Blandino, who at the time was the owner of Too Faced, 'cause now it's an Estee brand. He sat me down in a office with like all his team. And basically was like, \"We have not been doing very good justice to a particular community with our foundations and we want you to expand the Born This Way line and like be the face of it.\" And I was like \"Wow.\" At that time, no one had ever done a campaign like that. You know, it really took me aback because I think it also reminded me of those earlier days in my career of hearing that \"This diversity thing is going to get you nowhere.\" And so it was kind of like a full circle moment for me.\n\n[It's finally here.

He added that even two of the top performing equities shops, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, wouldn't beef up bonus pools by 20% \"in their wildest dreams.\"\n\nWhat gives?\n\nVolatility jolted back to life in 2018 and equities revenues have surged, totalling $34.6 billion through the first three quarters at the top global firms, according to Bloomberg data. That's a 16% increase from the $29.7 billion over the same period in 2017, and a 14% increase from the $30.4 billion reported in the same period in 2016.\n\nBut there are some caveats to the healthy surface level figures, as the gains weren't evenly spread across banks or equities product lines.\n\nIn earnings calls this year, many banks have called out performance from their derivatives and prime finance teams.\n\nSome stock trading operations made a killing on the volatility spike in February \u2014 especially derivatives teams that were positioned to capitalize on the CBOE Volatility Index spike \u2014 as well as from subsequent bouts of market turmoil in March and more recently.\n\nHedge funds have also been active, so the business of providing them with loans and other services, known as prime brokerage, has been robust as well.\n\nElectronic or algorithmic stock trading has also done well, but that's a commoditized business, McCormack noted, and inherently involves less staff in favor of machines and lines of code.\n\nRead more: Equity traders are crushing it as big banks celebrate a huge six months\n\nThe gains in traditional stock trading for clients via humans, known as cash equities, have been more measured. That business was up 7% through the first half of the year at the 12 largest firms, compared with 35% for derivatives and 17% for prime, according to the most current data from industry consultant Coalition.\n\nThis more human-intensive and less sexy equities business line has in recent years been overlooked and underinvested in, which McCormack says has been mistake.\n\n\"Most banks have made 'cash' their red headed step child, which is unfortunate and a mistake as all these high margin businesses - derivs, prime, electronic - only work with a 'cash' engine,\" he said in the post, adding that that if \"your client franchise isn't strong, the other stuff doesn't perform.\"\n\nSome traders will see 20% bumps come bonus time \u2014 some even 50%, McCormack said. But that will be highly individualized and specific, rather than a rising tide across the field. For every trader pulling in $1.5 million \u2014 the outlier \u2014 there are hundreds that will draw $450,000.\n\n\"I believe most people will be disappointed in comp, meaning it will be flat,\" McCormack wrote. \"Flat is the new up, equities will subsidize other business areas this year and that's the nature of the beast.\"\n\nThe only area where compensation will be in a \"different zip code\" is derivatives, and even then \"not everyone will benefit.\"\n\nAnd of course, derivatives has been one of the hottest hiring sectors of the year. Many of the star traders who brought in tens of millions in profits during the VIX spike parlayed that performance into a job at a new firm\u2014 meaning they likely would have already been well-compensated for the healthy bonus they sacrificed by leaving.\n\nSee also:", "President Donald Trump has ditched a number of planned activities and exhibited intense spurts of anger over the past few weeks as he laments his party's midterm losses and his embarrassment over being mocked for skipping an important World War I memorial in Paris because of light rainfall.\n\nEyeing an incoming Democratic-majority House of Representatives that can subpoena and investigate him at will, \"Trump has retreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment,\" the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a number of sources familiar with the president.\n\nTrump's reported brooding anger coincides with his cancelling a number of his presidential outings and activities, while lashing out at allies on Twitter.\n\nTrump visibly, palpably angry\n\nA White House staffer reaches for the microphone held by CNN's Jim Acosta as he questions Trump.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nThe Surface Pro 6 in laptop mode. Best Buy\n\nMicrosoft has been slowly but surely building itself up as a serious competitor in the PC hardware business, and so far, it's been doing a pretty great job. Recent products include the likes of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2, which we recently reviewed, as well as the Surface Go.\n\nIt all started, however, with the original Microsoft Surface Pro, which was arguably the first product that showed the world Microsoft could truly compete in hardware. These days, Microsoft is up to the Surface Pro 6, the latest and greatest in the Surface Pro line. But does the new Surface Pro 6 live up to the Surface Pro name? We put it to the test to find out.\n\nAs with any new product, the first thing you'll notice about the new Surface Pro is its design, and it's a great-looking device \u2014 but not all that different-looking compared to previous iterations of the Surface Pro. In fact, if you put the Surface Pro 6 next to the Surface Pro 5, or even the Surface Pro 4, you'd be hard-pressed telling them apart \u2014 save for the fact that this time around there's a Matte Black color option.\n\nOn the front of the device, you'll find the 12.3-inch touchscreen, along with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera with support for Windows Hello. On the left side, there's a headphone jack, while the right side is where you'll find the full-sized USB port, mini DisplayPort, and Surface Connect charging port. On the top, there's the power button and volume rocker. Then, on the back, there's the kickstand. Despite what it may look like in photos, the kickstand is very sturdy and infinitely adjustable \u2014 so you don't have to live with using the device in one of two positions, like when you use the iPad with Apple's keyboard covers. Like other tablet kickstand-style devices, the Surface Pro 6 isn't overly comfortable to use like a laptop with the Type Cover on your lap \u2014 so if you intend on buying the Type Cover, we recommend sticking with a table of some kind.\n\nThe Surface Pro 6 in studio mode. Microsoft\n\nThe only thing we might have changed about the Surface Pro 6 design is that it would have been nice to include a USB-C port or two.\n\nApple has run full-force into adopting USB-C\u2014 causing some outrage. We get that Microsoft is positioning itself as a kind of anti-Apple by not forcing users to adopt dongles for older accessories, but USB-C is still the future, and not adding a USB-C port immediately dates the Surface Pro 6.\n\nAs mentioned, the display on the Surface Pro 6 comes in at 12.3-inches, and it has a resolution of 2,736 x 1,824 \u2014 and it's beautiful. Sure, it's pretty much the same as the display on last year's Surface Pro 5, but that doesn't take away from the fact that colors were vibrant and bright, making the Surface Pro 6 a great choice for those who appreciate a great display. The display is excellent when it comes to touch features too. We found it to be accurate and responsive to touch, and while you might want to use the Surface Pro Type Cover for some situations \u2014 like writing tech reviews \u2014 many will find using the on-screen keyboard and touch controls perfectly adequate for what they need this device for.\n\nUnder the hood, the Surface Pro 6 is an impressive beast for the form factor that it takes.\n\nThe base model includes an 8th-gen Intel Core i5 processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. From there, options range up to an Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and a full 1TB of storage. Of course, with those specs you'll have to pay $2,299, but it's an option if you want it.\n\nWe found that our model, which was the base model with a 256GB hard drive, was more than capable enough of handling any day-to-day tasks and could get us through a full day of work, plus some video-watching and other entertainment, perfectly fine. Of course, if you expect to use the Surface Pro 6 for more intensive tasks, like any video or audio editing, then it's worth upgrading.\n\nBeyond shelling out the cash for the tablet itself, there's some extra money you might want to spend \u2014 on the Microsoft Type Cover, which comes at $130, and the Microsoft Surface Pen, which costs $100. Those are expensive accessories. Sure, they're not quite as pricey as Apple's options, but they're expensive nonetheless.\n\nThe Surface Pro 6 in tablet mode. Microsoft\n\nNow, this isn't a review of the Surface Pro's accessories, but we can offer a few details.\n\nIn general, we found the Surface Pro 6's Type Cover to offer a nice, tactile typing experience \u2014 which was perfect for longer typing sessions. The touchpad was also nice, and while it could have been a bit larger, it worked perfectly fine. The Type Cover is only available in black if you want to pay the $130, though if you're willing to shell out $160 you can get a Platinum, Cobalt Blue, or Burgundy model too.\n\nThe Surface Pro Pen is pretty nice too. Now, take this with a grain of salt considering the fact that this tech reviewer isn't much of an artist, but the Surface Pro Pen generally felt nice and reacted well to our strokes. It has 4,096 levels of pressure, which is nice, though it would have been nice if it had a little more gesture control, like the new second-generation Apple Pencil.\n\nUltimately, the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is an excellent device and a great option for Windows fans who want to continue their experience in a more portable and tactile format. We do recommend the Type Cover to those who type a lot, but if you don't then you may not need to factor it into the cost.\n\nBut the question remains \u2014 is there a better option in this price range?\n\nWell, that depends.\n\nFor Windows 10 fans, the Surface Pro line is still the best way to experience the hybrid tablet design that has taken off over the past few years, but we still wish Microsoft would update the design a little, even if just to include more modern ports.\n\nFor those not married to Windows 10 and who don't mind using a mobile operating system, the new iPad Pro range is definitely something to consider, especially given the fact that it has a USB-C port and arguably better stylus. iPad aside, however, there's still nothing that can truly challenge the Surface Pro 6 in this segment \u2014 so if you like Windows 10, and want a hybrid, this is the way to go.\n\nBuy the Microsoft Surface Pro 6, starting at $899, available at Microsoft and Best Buy\n\nBuy the Microsoft Surface Pro Pen, starting at $99.99, available Best Buy\n\nBuy the Microsoft Surface Type Cover, starting at $129.99, available at Best Buy", "The American military's support mission along the US-Mexico border has sparked a lot of debate, with critics questioning aspects of the mission's legality, necessity, and short- and long-term implications.\n\nThe Department of Defense has yet to disclose an overall cost estimate of the deployment, which is expected to involve over 7,000 active-duty troops from across the US.\n\nRead more: Trump is sending thousands of troops to the border with Mexico \u2014 here's everything we know so far\n\nWith the main migrant caravan still hundreds of miles from the closest point on the border, it remains unclear just how long troops will be deployed there.\n\nThe New York Times reported they may have to wait until at least Thanksgiving to return home, and while the deployed troops were careful not to discuss politics with reporters, the prospect of spending another holiday away from home for the mundane missions along the border could dampen spirits.\n\nAccording to The Times, that is not the only issue with troop morale.\n\nPhotos taken at Base Camp Donna, in Texas, showed soldiers playing cards and football, resting on cots, and eating ready-t0-eat meals, or MREs.

Now on its seventh generation, I like to remind myself that it was the first truly stunning car I ever got a ride in.\n\nIt was back in the 1970s, at my grandparents' farm in Ohio. A car-nut friend of theirs paid a visit \u2014 in his 1967 Vette. \"Want a ride?\" he asked me. He didn't have to ask twice.

The North Face\n\nIf you haven't heard, The North Face is going \"green\" with ThermoBall \u2014 one of the company's largest lines.\n\nThermoBall is the line that hosts much of the company's famously lightweight, super warm outdoors gear, but the first product to actually go eco-friendly is the ThermoBall jacket ($199-$220)\u2014 an award-winning lightweight down-alternative coat.\n\nIf the name ThermoBall sounds familiar, it's because the line gained a lot of fanfare for its synthetic insulation. The round synthetic fiber clusters trap heat within small air pockets like down. This way, you get both the lightweight warmth and compressibility of down jackets with the wet-weather performance of synthetics. According to the company, Kansas State University showed the ThermoBall has the warmth equivalent to 600 fill goose down.\n\nThe ThermoBall Eco jacket is essentially the same as the original, except that it's made from recycled polyester fabric and recycled Primaloft insulation made from plastic bottles diverted from landfills. And, like all gear from The North Face, it comes with a generous lifetime guarantee.\n\nAs of November 2018, ThermoBall Eco can be picked up in stores and online, though not yet at outdoor retailers like REI.

Companies like Everlane, with its recycled outerwear, Girlfriend Collective, with leggings made from fishing nets, and Reformation, now offering a 70% recycled cashmere line, are just a few other examples. It's a particularly popular trend in the outdoor industry, calling to mind REI and Patagonia's many eco-initiatives and newcomers with strong social missions like Cotopaxi.\n\nThe North Face says it already offsets the environmental impact of shipping to its customers around the world, but reintroducing one of their most popular lines in recycled materials will pack more of a punch. The North Face estimates that material production and manufacturing \u2014 in other words, the making of their clothes \u2014 accounts for 60-80% of the company's total environmental impact. It's a natural next step for any company attempting sustainable change at scale.\n\nAnd it's not really new. The North Face started using recycled fibers across core products like the ever-popular Denali jackets as early as 1996, as well as in its Reaxion and Glacier lines. In 2018, it launched an entire Bottle Source collection made from plastic bottles cleaned out of national parks.\n\nThe new ThermoBall Eco is just its latest step towards phasing in recycled materials to its production line. And it's a good choice \u2014 the ThermoBall garnered such fanfare before for its no-compromise mix of the warmth and compactness of down and the all-weather wearability of synthetics, and while the company (and supporters of more eco-friendly practices) hopes the new Eco version will do well this winter, it's probably how good the jacket is that'll drive people to pick the ThermoBall. A smaller environmental impact is just a big bonus.", "Few could have predicted that a dispute over an end-of-game decision by Draymond Green could be the turning point in the Golden State Warriors dynasty, but one day later, things are uglier than ever with the reigning champions.\n\nOn Monday, Green turned the ball over while trying to dribble full-court in the final seconds of regulation, with the Warriors tied with the Los Angeles Clippers. As the Warriors returned to the bench to prepare for overtime, Kevin Durant clapped angrily at Green, yelling at him to get him the ball for the final shot.\n\nOnce on the bench, Green appeared to berate Durant, and teammates stepped in-between them as Green shouted at Durant throughout the break. The Warriors would go on to lose in overtime.\n\nAfter the game, reports indicated that things were worse than they appeared. ESPN reported that the dispute carried over into the locker room in one of the most intense exchanges of the Warriors dynasty. The Athletic later reported that the exchange included Green making an over-the-line comment about Durant's impending free agency. ESPN reported on Tuesday that despite the intense exchange in the locker room, it never threatened to get physical.\n\nRead more:Kevin Durant and Draymond Green's spat reportedly carried over into an intense locker-room dispute that centered on Durant's impending free agency\n\nAfter details leaked out, the Warriors suspended Green for their Tuesday game against the Atlanta Hawks, which they won, 110-103.\n\nTeammates fight and argue all the time, but from the sounds of it, this has the potential to be a franchise-altering dispute.\n\nThe Athletic's Marcus Thompson divulged more details on Wednesday, reporting that after Durant told Green to get him the ball on Monday, Green went off on Durant. According to Thomspon, Green repeatedly called Durant a \"b----\" and then attacked Durant for how he's handled his impending free agency, leaving the door open to the idea that he might leave after the season.\n\nVia Thompson:\n\n\"According to multiple sources, Green then went on to make it clear he's been making plays for years. He reminded Durant the Warriors were winning before Durant showed up so he wouldn't stand for Durant talking to him as if he were a scrub. Green accused Durant of making the whole season about him even though he was going to leave after this season. Green let out his frustrations about how Durant has handled free agency \u2014 keeping his options open and keeping the story alive, consuming the Warriors and their season with talk of what Durant will do next.\"\n\nEarlier in the season, Durant told The Los Angeles Times' Dan Woike that he felt free agency was a topic that was off-limits, even among teammates.\n\n\"That's business. We don't get into anyone else's business,\" Durant told Woike. \"There's money involved in that stuff. Everything is involved, your life is involved, free agency, a new contract. I don't think guys overstep those boundaries when it comes to that. We don't even play around about that because we're so locked in on the season.\"\n\nAccording to Thompson, Green expected to be punished for his actions but didn't expect a suspension, which cost him over $120,000. Green and head coach Steve Kerr infamously got into a heated dispute that required both men to be separated in 2016, and Green was only fined. Green thought that dispute was worse than Monday night's with Durant, according to Thompson.\n\nThompson also reported that while many people on the Warriors thought Green's tirade went too far, some even thought there was some truth in his criticism's of Durant. Thompson reported that Green spoke with Kerr and Warriors GM Bob Myers after the dispute and reiterated his stance that Durant's free agency has become a distraction. Stephen Curry also reportedly met with Green after the incident and Green told Curry the same thing.\n\nAfter Tuesday's game, Durant was tight-lipped about the situation. When asked if he and Green had made up, he said, \"Nah.\" When asked if Green had crossed a line, Durant said he would keep things \"in-house\" and said he was sure he and Green would make up at some point, citing the long season ahead.\n\nThe Warriors will rebound from the incident. They remain the most talented team by a long stretch, and they've shown this year that they all have a new comfort level on the court.\n\nBut as Thompson noted, there are ramifications to everything that unfolded. Green and Durant will make amends, but it's worth wondering how much Green's words will linger with Durant.\n\nMeanwhile, management took the side of Durant by suspending Green. Green is two years away from free agency, and it's possible that the issue could affect his feelings for the team, even though he has said he wants to re-sign with the Warriors.\n\nThe Warriors also have to protect against a scenario where both Durant and Green want out. Trading Durant would probably be a non-starter for the Warriors unless they're sure Durant is leaving at the end of the season. But what if keeping Durant hinges on his relationship with Green? The Warriors could theoretically be backed into a corner, but that's only if the issue lingers.\n\nThe Warriors' win-loss record likely won't be affected by this issue, but even some insiders wonder if it's something that could eat at the team. Thompson reported that some players already suspected Durant was leaving after the season. Durant's departure would break up this Warriors dynasty and knock them down a peg. If they fail to win the championship this year, this spat could prove to be a pivotal moment in the team's history.", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Increased tolerance for risk is also thought to be behind banks' decision to reduce covenant quality on loans. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Reserve Bank of Australia have all previously sounded the alarm on the decreasing quality of leveraged lending.\n\nThe data also suggests that loan demand is falling citing increases in customers internally generated funds, reduced investment, and customers shifting their borrowing to new lenders as reasons for the slowdown.\n\nAccording to the Fed's survey: \"[Banks are] reportedly narrowing loan rate spreads on C&I loans to firms of all sizes. A significant net fraction of banks also reportedly eased loan covenants to large and middle-market firms.\"\n\nThe picture is different for foreign banks, however, which reported that demand for C&I loans remained unchanged over the third quarter.\n\nWhile reduced covenant quality is often associated with higher credit supply within debt markets putting borrowers in a position of strength.

A spokesperson for the mayor provided the following statement:\n\n\"Amazon's announcement on Tuesday morning was a matter of when, not if, for Nashville. When we were notified by Amazon on Monday afternoon that they planned on making the official announcement the following morning, it was the culmination of months of hard work.

It forgoes any advertising, e-commerce, and celebrity endorsements. It rarely grants interviews and very occasionally makes products available to the mass market.\n\nTurns out, a lips-are-sealed tactic is the best way to build buzz.\n\n\"Luxury is a dream, and revealing too much of what goes on behind the scenes would spoil the magic,\" a representative for the House of Goyard told Hypebeast last year, adding: \"We believe that whispering softly in someone's ears is not only more elegant, but also much more efficient than screaming at the top of one's lungs.\"\n\nIts mystery demands desire. Everyone loves a sense of exclusivity, and what's more exclusive than a brand whose heritage and allure is based on discretion, garnering business solely through word of mouth of its influential clients?\n\nAs Sarah Young of the Independent writes of Goyard's anti-spotlight stance: \"Those who know, know. For them, it's all about attracting the people who count.\"\n\nAfter all, high-end brands risk losing their luster and jeopardizing their exclusivity if they fall into the everyday hands of mass consumption. Goyard's under-the-radar reputation is the pinnacle of ultimate indulgence for its buyers.\n\nRich and famous clientele\n\nThe coveted chevron-printed canvas and leather luggage has been seen accompanying everyone from the newly named Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, to the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, to the Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse, who has a custom trunk for his cutlery.\n\nGoyard is also increasingly popular among hip-hop's elite. The rapper A$AP Rocky wore a Goyard messenger bag to the 2016 Grammy Awards, and Kanye West sported a Goyard briefcase during Paris Fashion Week in 2009.\n\nAnd the apple doesn't fall far from the tree \u2014 West's daughter North was spotted in Los Angeles in February with a personalized Goyard St. Louis bag, costing roughly $1,460 after customization. Meanwhile, her aunt Khloe Kardashian jetted to Tokyo with her belongings packed in not one but two customized Goyard bags.\n\nThey're part of an impressive list of clients including Coco Chanel, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Jacques Cartier, Pablo Picasso, Karl Lagerfeld, and the Duchess of Windsor, who collected many Goyard pieces, such as pet accessories and a trunk to accommodate 150 pairs of shoes.\n\nGoyard's owner, Jean-Michel Signoles, purchased much of the duke and duchess' collection when Sotheby's auctioned off the contents of their Paris home in 1997. A document case and monogrammed trunk went for nearly $15,000, while another lot sold for $32,500, Town & Country reported.\n\nThat's nothing compared to one of Goyard's 19th-century-style trunks that fetches $59,315, according to the Business of Fashion. The Palace trunk costs $10,120, with additional customization beginning at $165.\n\nBut not all its prices are so far-fetched for such an exclusive brand, such as the entry-level $300 Saint Sulpice cardholder or the $2,430 Grand Bleu messenger bag. A classic Goyard tote costs $1,150, while a comparable Louis Vuitton is $1,810.\n\nIt's 'all about traveling, distant horizons, escapism'\n\nGoyard's focus on artisanal craftsmanship prevents it from churning out the bountiful merchandise that Louis Vuitton does, arguably helping Goyard hold a higher level of quality and prestige compared with its competitor.\n\nAnd because it's like an heirloom, the brand holds resale value, Rati Sahi Levesque, the chief merchant of the luxury-resale site The Real Real, told Racked.\n\n\"It's an insider's bag,\" Levesque said, \"but it doesn't scream luxury.\"\n\nGoyard's serious collectors prefer individual, custom pieces over the brand's more discernible items, such as the St. Louis tote and or the Saigon handbag.\n\nEvery order \"is the result of a very close creative collaboration between a customer and the Goyard team,\" and the limits are endless, Goyard told Town & Country.\n\nEver authentic, though, the company leaves special orders up to its discretion, eschewing any requests that aren't considered on brand \u2014 even if it's from a recognizable name.\n\n\"We turned down several orders for custom trunks for giant TV screens, for instance,\" the fashion house told Town & Country. \"Goyard is all about traveling, distant horizons, escapism, so a TV trunk by Goyard really sounded like an oxymoron.\"\n\nA bespoke gardening trunk, on the other hand, was deemed whimsical, timeless, practical, and functional \u2014 something that \"truly captures the essence of Goyard.\" Commissioned in 2015, it cost roughly $15,000.\n\nThe brand is so elusive that even historic special orders aren't known to the company.\n\n\"Finding a rare trunk is an extremely complicated hunt, requiring near private investigator's skills ... and a lot of patience,\" a Goyard representative told Town & Country.\n\nAs Deborah Soss, Bergdorf Goodman's vice president of accessories and handbags, told Racked, \"I think there is always an allure to a bit of mystery.\"", "Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's will be selling major appliances at its flagship store for the first time ever this month in a likely bid to cash in on the demise of Sears.\n\nThe store is partnering with LG Electronics to open a new store-in-store at its 59th Street location in New York City.

Six weeks later, two inmates stabbed another guard 21 times with a homemade shank, nearly killing him.\n\nThe jail sounds like the last place anyone would want to spend a night \u2014 let alone two full months.\n\nBut that's exactly what seven law-abiding citizens did on the A&E documentary series \"60 Days In.\"\n\nThe show, the fifth season of which premieres in January, follows the participants' experiences as undercover inmates at an Arizona jail.\n\nRead more: The most shocking moments witnessed by undercover inmates on \"60 Days In\"\n\nThe volunteers \u2014 a diverse group that includes a real estate agent, a chaplain, a police officer, and an Army veteran \u2014 were booked on fake charges and assumed false identities during their stays at the Pinal County jail in Florence, Arizona.\n\nThe undercover inmates lived among the jail's 600-inmate population without other inmates or corrections officers learning their secret. Only Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb and a small handful of administrators were in on the ruse \u2014 the rest of the jail's workforce was told the show was a documentary about jails on the US-Mexico border.\n\nEach of the undercover inmates was tasked with finding out information about a specific aspect of life in jail, including gang life, drug culture, and jail operations. They reported their findings to Lamb at the end of their two-month stint.\n\nPrevious seasons of \"60 Days In\" took place at Atlanta's Fulton County Jail and southern Indiana's Clark County Jail. Lamb said he wanted to bring the program to his Arizona jail in an effort to increase transparency and show people what life behind bars is really like.\n\n\"When this opportunity presented itself, we saw an opportunity to really get an inside look at our facility, and show the people of our county as well what kind of facility we run, and be able to try and address issues that we thought we were having in the facility,\" Lamb told Business Insider.\n\nThroughout the course of the show, the participants are exposed to rampant violence, racism, drug use, and harassment from other inmates.\n\n\"Being in jail is a nightmare. It is just hell,\" one of the undercover volunteers, a real estate agent named Brooke, told Business Insider. \"I think people that are out doing crimes, they don't know what they're signing up for.\"\n\nA group of inmates at Pinal County Adult Detention Center in Florence, Arizona.

Within moments of arriving in their units, the volunteers were greeted by members of their respective races, who explained to them where members of each race slept, ate, and used the bathroom.\n\n\"The politics of jail is you stick with your own kind,\" a participant named Abner, a chaplain from New York, said on the show. \"You have to follow your race, your people, and the rules.\"\n\nIn one early episode, the inmates learned that even haircuts are rife with racial tension. When Abner, who is Latino, tried to use the jail-issued hair clippers, he was brusquely informed that white inmates get their hair cut first.\n\n\"I know in my mind this is about power and control,\" he said.\n\nDrug use is another frequent topic of concern on the show. Several participants reported that inmates at the Pinal County jail would frequently smuggle drugs inside their body cavities, while other inmates resorted to unusual and dangerous homemade drugs.\n\n\"One woman, she was in a cell a few doors down, she was literally snorting coffee grounds to try to get a high,\" Brooke told Business Insider.\n\nLamb said after filming wrapped up, a number of changes were made based on the information he got from the undercover participants. For example, one of the volunteers clued him in to a scheme some of the inmates were using to pass notes, or \"kites,\" from one section of the jail to the other.\n\nAccording to Lamb, the inmates would sneak the notes in between trays of food, which would then be delivered to other units by trustees, the group of inmates who distribute food and perform other tasks. Lamb said the inmates knew they could get away with it because they had studied the \"methodical\" way guards would stack the trays.\n\n\"A lot of these people, they're very intelligent, and they have nothing else to do all day but try to figure this out, try to get one over on us,\" Lamb told Business Insider. \"And they're very good at it.

Michael Gianaris, a Queens lawmaker who described the offered funds as a \"ransom\" New York was paying.\n\nRead more: New York City has lured Amazon with more than $1.5 billion in incentives \u2014 here's what else they agreed to\n\nMeanwhile, playmakers in the tech industry have used social media to slam Bezos for the large amounts of money the cities offered in exchange for HQ2 and for a lack of transparency in the decision-making process.\n\nIn a series of tweets, the developer David Heinemeier Hansson, of Ruby on Rails fame, accused Bezos, the richest man in the world, of extracting \"blatant loot\" from cities in a move of \"total domination.\"\n\nHansson, a founder of the web development firm Basecamp, also questioned Bezos' role as a stakeholder in his company.\n\nHansson wasn't the only one in the tech community to slam Bezos.\n\nTake a look at some of the other tech leaders who expressed their frustration with Bezos and Amazon on Twitter:\n\nRead more about Amazon's HQ2 project:", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nAfter more than a year of deliberations, Amazon has announced that it will be dividing its new headquarters between two cities: Long Island City in the Queens borough of New York City and Arlington, Virginia.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nBoth locations will staff over 25,000 employees and will join Seattle as Amazon's three headquarters in North America. In addition, the e-tailer is opening an Operations Center of Excellence in Nashville, Tennessee that will create 5,000 jobs and support the arm of Amazon that's responsible for fulfillment, transportation, and supply chain.\n\nLong Island City and Arlington share several characteristics that make them good locations for Amazon's new headquarters:\n\nAccess to tech recruitment opportunities. One of the biggest reasons Amazon selected two separate locations is because it can recruit more talent by spreading out. And being in New York City and Arlington (near Washington, D.C.) gives it access to graduates from major universities in those areas, such as Columbia University, New York University, Georgetown University, and George Washington University, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nProximity to major urban centers and ease of access. Both Arlington and Long Island City are very close to major metropolitan centers. In addition, they have expansive transportation systems and airports available that make them very easy to access for workers nearby or executives visiting from Seattle, according to The WSJ.\n\nLucrative tax benefits. Both Arlington and Long Island City have offered Amazon performance-based financial incentives that are based on how many jobs its new headquarters create. In Long Island City, these incentives amount to a whopping $1.5 billion, while in Arlington they total to a still-impressive $573 million.", "Why you'll love it: The 2018 9.7-inch iPad is an absolute steal at $330 with a gorgeous sharp screen, high-end metal design, and support for the Apple Pencil.\n\nApple's iPads have always been the best tablets you can buy, but the high price tags made it tough to find an iPad on a budget. All that has changed with the 2018 9.7-inch iPad. It costs a mere $330, and it offers nearly all of the same high-end specs and features as the top-of-the-line iPad Pros.\n\nIf you own an aging iPad or iPad Mini, the new 9.7-inch iPad is an excellent upgrade. Obviously, if you have an iPad Air 2 or an iPad Pro, you don't need to get the new one. The 2018 iPad is for anyone who has always wanted an iPad, but couldn't afford the $500+ price tag. It's an absolute steal at $329.99.\n\nThe 9.7-inch screen is sharp and clear with its 2,048 x 1,536-pixel resolution, the A10 processor is very capable (even though it's not the iPhone X's A11 chip), the battery life should be great, and you can even buy things on it with Apple Pay, thanks to the Touch ID fingerprint sensor.\n\nBest of all, it supports the Apple Pencil, an incredible stylus with virtually no lag. You will have to pay $100 extra for the Pencil, but if you like to take notes or draw on your iPad, it is well worth it. Naturally, any Bluetooth keyboard also works with the iPad, so if you want to use it as a quasi-laptop, you can pick up a great keyboard.\n\nYou simply can't beat those specs at that price point. Comparable Android tablets cost hundreds of dollars more, and the iPad still has a better app library and accessory support.\n\nThe aluminum build looks and feels premium, and the 9.7-inch screen size makes it a very portable device that's easy to stow away in your bag. It's quite light, too, so you can happily binge-watch Netflix in bed on your new iPad. Tech nerds will say it's a boring old design, but it's tried and true. Plus, the aluminum build is durable.\n\nPros: Incredible price for an iPad, powerful A10 processor, slick aluminum design, Touch ID for security and Apple Pay, gorgeous screen, supports the Apple Pencil, iOS 11\n\nCons: Not the latest A11 processor found on the iPhone X", "Reuters/Fred Thornhill\n\nCanada Goose reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates.\n\nThw winter-coat maker raised its full-year guidance.\n\nShares climbed 15% following the results.\n\nWatch Canada Goose trade live.\n\nCanada Goose soared Wednesday, up 15%, after reporting strong second-quarter results and raising its guidance.\n\nThe winter-coat maker earned an adjusted 0.46 Canadian dollars a share as revenue spiked 33.6% versus a year ago to 230.3 million Canadian dollars.

Conner was convinced she had encountered the next big thing in wellness while on a recent trip to Mexico: eco-friendly yoga mats and equipment made out of cork.\n\nNine months later, 42 Birds was born.\n\nBut the e-commerce brand, which sells its products on its website as well as on Amazon, isn't just another direct-to-consumer startup. Conner and Rednor started it \u2014 and incubated it at Decoded, the independent ad agency they run \u2014 because they wanted to understand what exactly it takes to helm a successful DTC brand.\n\n\"We wanted to start out own DTC brand to build our expertise in e-commerce from the ground up,\" Rednor told Business Insider. \"We could pretend to be experts, or build the expertise ourselves. In order to talk the talk, we wanted to walk the walk.\"\n\nDecoded has a unique approach at cracking the DTC trend, but it isn't alone. The cofounders of public relations firm Azione, Leland Drummond and Michele Thomas, are partnering with The Coveteur co-founder Stephanie Mark to launch The League, a new active-intimates DTC brand, next year, based on what they've learned working with DTC brands over the years.\n\nMore broadly, as hundreds of new brands crop up to upend virtually every industry by selling everything from mattresses to makeup directly to consumers using digital media, a new wave of ad agencies is making inroads in an area where traditional ad giants are still finding their way.\n\n\"Big agencies are not equipped to work at the pace and in a manner that matches the needs of a digitally native vertical brand,\" said Mike Cassidy, partner at private equity firm August Spark, which funds small businesses, including e-commerce agency BVAccel. \"You have to be experts at retail, e-commerce, and digital \u2014 which is a specialty few can master.\"\n\nA roster of new agencies have emerged around the needs of digitally native brands\n\nThe DTC revolution has spawned a roster of agencies over the past decade that have positioned themselves around the needs of digitally native brands, from creative and performance marketing to media buying as well as strategic planning and communications.\n\nThese agencies, from Gin Lane and YellowHammer Media to Derris and BVAccel, to name a few, all pride themselves on having a nuanced understanding of the space and personalized ways of working. Many of them work exclusively with DTC brands, but they differ in the ways they approach the space and actually structure their relationships with them.\n\nRead more: A new type of ad agency is catering to brands born on digital channels - and industry giants need a plan\n\nSome are upending traditional fee structures to cater to DTC brands\n\nWhile Decoded has incubated its own DTC brand, others are upending traditional fee structures and retainer agreements to offer more flexibility to DTC brands.\n\nYellowHammer, which specializes in performance marketing, for instance, operates like an extension of its clients' businesses, which include hot-sauce-subscription seller Fuego Box and luxury-sheets retailer Boll & Branch. And instead of traditional retainer fees, the company gets paid on the basis of the brands' growth. So the more sales it drives for its ad partners, the more money it gets.\n\n\"We have managed to create a service infrastructure that really allows us to be a part of their team,\" Sam Appelbaum, YellowHammer's general manager, told Business Insider. \"Direct-to-consumer marketing is essentially outcome-based marketing, and our thesis is that's where all of marketing is eventually going to go.\"\n\nSimilarly, e-commerce agency Diff offers flexibility to its clients, solving for a string of different problems that its clients may be facing depending on the stage of their growth, according to CEO Ben Crudo. And unlike traditional ad giants, these services don't come with a hefty price tag. A budget between $20,000 and $50,000 could get a DTC brand a pretty decent-sized team, he said.\n\nAn early-stage startup that has just finished raising money on Kickstarter, for example, would probably benefit most from a sleek new website that could be put together by pooling in strategy, user experience, and front-end development resources. But a more mature DTC brand may need more help on its back-end operations to improve shipping.\n\n\"Brands are built not just through nifty marketing but also by filling holes that appear in the business,\" Crudo said. \"We solve for the biggest problem at every stage of maturity for a DTC brand, bringing both technical and business savvy and cutting through the red tape.\"\n\nAnd others are offering their services in return for a stake in DTC brands\n\nMeanwhile, firms like PR, branding, and content agency Derris and creative agency Gin Lane, have a different approach and often end up taking a stake in startups in return for helping them craft their business and marketing.\n\nDerris, for example, has been taking a small ownership stake in most of its DTC clients for years. But last year, it also raised a $10 million fund to invest in future clients by launching a separate wing called Amity Supply. So now, the firm invests money into its clients' startups on top of the stake it already gets for its services.\n\n\"Put simply, we needed an economic model like the ownership-stake approach in order to justify working with early-stage brands,\" founder Jesse Derris told Business Insider.\n\nSimilarly, Gin Lane, which works exclusively with DTC brands and has developed creative identities for brands including Hims and AYR, has also started asking for equity in companies like Quip and Smile Direct Club in return for its services. After all, there are downsides to working with these kinds of brands.\n\n\"Working with early-stage businesses that you're trying to get off the ground is very different than working with a large brand \u2014 and it's very difficult to be really good at both,\" Gin Lane CEO Nick Ling said. \"But we'd rather be a sushi knife than a Swiss Army knife and be really good at one thing versus average at everything.\"\n\nLarger agencies aren't taking the threat lying down\n\nDTC brands are fundamentally different from larger, more traditional brands. They are digital natives, own their first-party customer data, and rely heavily on performance marketing on digital channels to scale their businesses.\n\n\"The problem with the ad world is they work from the outside in \u2014 they are looking in on product, trying to get your attention to connect the product to a consumer's ephemeral craving,\" said Gene Liebel, founding partner at Brooklyn, New York-based shop Work & Co., which focuses on product as much as it does on marketing.\n\nSo DTC brands are increasingly opting for specialist agencies like those previously mentioned rather than larger, bigger ad companies.\n\n\"When we're navigating things for the first time, they're either willing to jump in and figure it out with us, or they've already done it countless times before with other DTC brands,\" said Rithvik Venna, cofounder and chief operating officer at OROS Apparel. \"This is a special skill set that is not so readily available at a more traditional agency.\"\n\n\"In order to grow, we have to constantly do new things hinged on new areas of opportunity while continuing to do what's working efficiently,\" added Jonathan Newcomb, chief marketing officer at eyewear startup Felix Gray. \"That's the reason we look for specialists that are accustomed to the kind of goals we have.\"\n\nThis has started to put bigger ad companies under major pressure. But they aren't taking the threat lying down.\n\nFull-service digital agency Huge, which set up its own coffee shop in Atlanta three years ago to double up as a retail research and development facility, is now working on a new vending machine tied to a DTC offering set to launch in 2019.\n\nAnd media agency R2C has set up its own proprietary software to track its clients' marketing efforts on a cost-per-acquisition basis. It has also established a separate company called Leavened, which offers a platform and tools specifically for DTC companies.\n\n\"DTC brands have a high expectation for accountability of their marketing spend, including offline,\" R2C president and COO Jane Crisan said. \"We have made heavy investments over the last six years to create a suite of proprietary tools designed for this.\"", "Were the US to go to war with China or Russia today, it might lose, a new report to Congress from a panel of a dozen leading national-security experts warns.\n\n\"If the United States had to fight Russia in a Baltic contingency or China in a war over Taiwan, Americans could face a decisive military defeat,\" the report from the National Defense Strategy Commission \u2014 a bipartisan panel of experts handpicked by Congress to evaluate the 2018 National Defense Strategy \u2014 explained, calling attention to the erosion of America's edge as rival powers develop capabilities previously possessed only by the US.\n\nThe commission highlights China and Russia's energized and ongoing efforts to develop advanced anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) weaponry, systems that could result in \"enormous\" losses for the US military in a conflict. \"Put bluntly, the US military could lose the next state-versus-state war it fights,\" the report concludes.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy Commission has concluded that US national security is presently \"at greater risk than at any time in decades.\"\n\n\"America's ability to defend its allies, its partners, and its own vital interests is increasingly in doubt. If the nation does not act promptly to remedy these circumstances, the consequences will be grave and lasting.\"\n\nThe report calls into focus a concern that the US military is trying to address \u2014 that while the US put all of its efforts and energy into the fights against insurgents and terrorists in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and elsewhere, adversarial powers have been preparing for high-end conflict.\n\n\"Many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries \u2014 especially China and Russia \u2014 have atrophied,\" the commission argues.\n\nThe National Defense Strategy emphasizes the return of \"great power competition,\" placing the threat posed by rival powers like China and Russia above terrorism and other challenges. The military branches are, in response, shifting their attention to the development of future warfighting capabilities \u2014 even as the ISIS fight and Afghanistan War grind on.\n\nPreparation for high-end conflict is visible in the efforts across the Army, Navy, and Air Force to develop powerful stand-off weapons, such as long-range artillery and hypersonic strike platforms.\n\nThe commission is supportive of the National Defense Strategy, but it calls for faster measures and clearer explanations for how America plans to maintain its dominance. The report also called for an expansion of the current $716 billion defense budget, the bolstering of the nuclear arsenal, and innovative development of new weapons systems.", "Investors are the least optimistic on tech stocks since the depths of the financial crisis, and are instead piling into another, safer, corner of the market \u2014 healthcare.\n\nThis month Bank of America surveyed 225 fund managers with $641 billion in assets under management, who said the most \"crowded trade\" is in tech stocks \u2014 particularly the mega-cap consortium known as FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) and BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent).\n\nThe number of investors who said they're allocating funds to the sector lurched down 7 percentage points, with just 18% say they are overweight.

Each day this week, we're taking another look at the five vehicles that were runners-up that were selected from a pool of 15 finalists. We featured the 2018 Lincoln Navigator and the 2018 Ferrari 812 Superfast earlier this week. Today, it's the 2019 Jaguar I-PACE's turn to shine.\n\nElectric cars are the future. Even though people have been saying this for years, only recently have the world's mainstream automakers really taken this to heart. Sure, relatively affordable EVs have been on the road a decade now. But for far too many brands, going electric was more of a strategically prudent way to satisfy increasingly stringent emissions standards than a true commitment to electric mobility.\n\nThings are different now. Tesla can't make enough of its electric cars to keep up with demand. GM and Nissan are fully committed to production EVs. While luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Porsche have all prepared purpose-built EVs set to hit the market in the near future.\n\nAnd then there's Jaguar.\n\nOnce the byword for stodgy British retro luxury, Jag is now all-in on electric. In fact, Jaguar beat out its rivals to become the first mainstream luxury brand to have an EV with enough range to legitimately compete against Tesla.\n\nThe Jaguar I-PACE enters the market in a unique position in that it's the only car in its segment. Including the I-PACE, there are only four luxury EVs on the market and three of them are the Tesla Model S, Model X, and Model 3.\n\nWith the Model X the only other SUV. However, it should be noted that the Model X is a larger, mid-size three-row crossover SUV and doesn't compete directly with I-PACE that is significantly less expensive.\n\nSpecifically, the Jag will be the only electric compact crossover available until the Audi E-Tron, Mercedes-Benz EQ C, and Tesla Model Y hits showrooms.\n\nRecently, Business Insider spent a week with a 2019 Jaguar I-PACE EV400 HSE test car in Corris Gray. The 2019 Jaguar I-PACE starts at $69,500 while the top-spec HSE variant starts at $80,500. With options and fees, our test car came to $86,720.\n\nHere's a closer look at the 2019 Jaguar I-PACE EV400 HSE:", "Live Nation Entertainment is known best for putting on many of the biggest music concerts in the country, but its production arm is beginning to gain respect, too.\n\nHeather Parry, president of Live Nation Productions, has tenaciously built the company in just under three years into a destination for artists who want to make work that goes beyond glossy visual marketing. This has led to Live Nation Productions getting on the ground floor for documentaries like \"Can't Stop Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story\" and Netflix's \"Gaga: Five Foot Two.\"\n\nBut what brought the company an instant jolt of clout in Hollywood was Parry jumping on the most recent remake of \"A Star Is Born.\"\n\nParry, who has a thick Rolodex thanks to her years at MTV and decade running Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company, began working her connections back when Clint Eastwood was still attached to direct and Beyonc\u00e9 was in talks to star in the lead role.\n\n\"I was at a barbecue at Joel Silver's house, and Greg Silverman, who was running production at Warner Bros. at the time, was there, and I started talking to him about it,\" Parry told Business Insider. \"I really wanted to see if Live Nation could be involved.\"\n\nWhat Silverman, or really any executive at any studio, didn't realize was how much Live Nation was connected to artists and music fans.\n\nAlong with Live Nation Entertainment owning over 100 music festivals and venues, as well as owning the huge ticket-sales and distribution company Ticketmaster, Live Nation also houses the managers of some of the biggest acts on the planet.\n\n\"Where I sit, on one side of me is the manager of Miley Cyrus and on the other is [the one] who manages Lady Gaga. It's a good place to be sitting,\" Parry said with a laugh.\n\nParry didn't lock things down at the barbecue (Silverman was ousted at Warner Bros. months later), but she wasn't close to giving up.\n\nBradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in \"A Star Is Born.\" Warner Bros. The next few years passed with \"A Star is Born\" still trying to get off the ground, and in that time, Parry began conversations with Bradley Cooper's agent, then Cooper himself (who would eventually star in and direct the movie), as well as more executives at Warner Bros., where she laid out what Live Nation could provide the movie \u2014 posters of the movie at music festivals; the trailer playing before the biggest acts come onstage; dedicated email blasts thanks to Ticketmaster.\n\nThe momentum was building, but what really clinched it, Parry said, was a chance encounter with \"A Star Is Born\" producer Bill Gerber at a party for a Martha Stewart book.\n\nParry said that while everyone gravitated toward Stewart to get her to sign a copy of their book, she was at the other side of the room with Gerber, talking about the movie.\n\n\"Billy came back around after I met with Warner Bros., and he said, 'Let's go,'\" Parry recalled.\n\nLive Nation came on to produce the movie in a hybrid role of putting in financing while also providing unique marketing to promote its release.\n\nRead more: All of the \"A Star Is Born\" movies ranked from worst to best\n\nBy the time Live Nation came onboard, \"A Star Is Born\" was already in production with Lady Gaga as the lead opposite Cooper. So what Parry focused on was how to get the word out to music lovers.\n\nOver the summer, if you went to a well-known concert, you probably saw big \"A Star Is Born\" posters at the venue. And as the trailer became a meme sensation, it also showed in front of thousands at events like Lollapalooza and Country LakeShake.\n\nAnd then Ticketmaster worked its magic.\n\n\"Ticketmaster has something like 180 million emails, so I got them to send me everyone who bought tickets to Gaga's last tour and everyone who is buying her Vegas residency,\" Parry said. \"So when the trailer was sent out, you really targeted her authentic fans. When I worked for Sandler, we dreamt for this kind of data.\"\n\nAnd in tracking down the \"authentic fan,\" Parry didn't stop there. She spread the net to the fans of others in the movie, like those who bought tickets to Dave Chappelle's recent comedy shows. They even targeted Bruno Mars fans. Though he's not in the movie, he wrote the hit \"Uptown Funk\" with Mark Ronson, who cowrote the movie's hit song \"Shallow.\"\n\nLive Nation Productions President Heather Parry. Vivien Killilea/Getty Now on top of bankable stars, a trailer people couldn't stop making memes about, and great reviews from critics, Live Nation Productions made sure the movie was saturated throughout the live-event community. That's a kind of direct marketing that many studios hunger for but are rarely able to get.\n\nIt's all led to \"A Star Is Born\" having huge box-office success. Made for $36 million, it's earned over $323 million worldwide to date. That's been a shocking surprise to many \u2014 except Parry.\n\n\"I had a pretty good feeling,\" she said of the movie's success. \"It's Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper!\"\n\nLooking forward, Parry is very busy. She said Live Nation has five documentaries and a docuseries in production and may branch out to competition shows and music specials. But despite being on a huge success like \"A Star Is Born,\" the mission doesn't change. \"Make films the way the artists wanted to make them,\" Parry said.\n\n\"A year from now, if we've done something else outside the box, that's what makes me the most proud and happy,\" she said.", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \"Payments Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

The firm plans on using the funding to bring its technology to Asia, Europe, and South America, as well as increase hiring. This funding can propel Poynt to the forefront of an increasingly crowded space.\n\nMerchants want value-added offerings from their POS providers. The line between physical and digital commerce is blurring, causing merchants to demand more from their POS providers, such as business management tools or offerings that enable them to serve customers more broadly. Poynt VP of Business Operation and Strategy Rishi Taparia previously told Business Insider Intelligence that in a digital-first world, merchants are shifting from caring about a provider's payment services to considering how that provider's offerings and tools can best help them service customers beyond payments.\n\nThat's caused immense competition in the space. While Poynt offers one of the most robust suites of features on its platform \u2014 with connectivity, diversity of payment methods, an app ecosystem, and unparalleled developer access \u2014 it's largely been eclipsed by bigger players entering the space. Payments technology provider Stripe recently launched Terminal, a product designed for in-store payment acceptance that offers POS hardware, application programming interfaces (APIs), software developer kits (SDKs), and software to manage connected devices. And Square recently launched the Square Terminal, a mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) device that complements its existing suite of POS hardware. Moreover, other major players like Ingenico and PayPal have been diversifying their offerings and building out full-suite solutions to meet the shifting needs of sellers. But despite flying under the radar, Poynt has still been able to see volume as the space becomes increasingly crowded and puts pressure on the firm to expand.", "President Donald Trump has many \"authoritarian leanings,\" but the structure of America's political system ultimately restrains him from being a full-blown authoritarian leader, a top foreign policy expert says.\n\n\"Trump has authoritarian leanings, inclinations, and impulses.

But now fierce competition from mid-priced phones from makers such as Xiaomi Corp <1810.HK> has become difficult to ignore.\n\nApple's vision of becoming a company driven by paid services such as Apple Music and iCloud rests on building as large a base of device owners as possible, with the iPhone serving as a critical anchor.\n\nWithout volume growth in promising overseas markets such as India, Brazil and Russia, the worry is that Apple has at least parts of its strategy wrong with too much emphasis on its premium brand and the high prices that go with it.\n\nA trio of Chinese smartphone makers - Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - accounted for roughly a quarter of the global market in the first half of 2018, according to data from research firm IDC, up from just 8.9 percent for all of 2014.\n\nBut with the exception of fiscal 2015, Apple hasn't grown its market share. It had 13.6 percent of the world market in the first half of this year, down from 14.8 percent for 2014, although its share typically rises with full-year results due to strong sales in December.\n\nApple currently has what it calls an active installed base of 1.3 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs, serving as the pool of potential customers for its services - a business which hit $37.1 billion in revenue for the most recent fiscal year.\n\nThat represented 14 percent of Apple's overall revenue, up from 8.5 percent in fiscal 2015 when iPhone unit sales hit their all-time high.\n\nBut IDC expects the global smartphone market to grow only 2.4 percent on a compound basis to 1.6 billion units by 2022, indicating a saturated market in which the Cupertino, California-based firm will be fighting rivals for each customer.\n\nXiaomi, in particular, is gaining fans rapidly. In India, where Apple has only a minor presence, Xiaomi has in some quarters beat Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> to be the country's top phone seller and is also racing up the rankings in European markets where it is opening retail stores.\n\n\"This is the case where it's much different in other parts of the world,\" said Ryan Reith, program vice president for IDC's mobile device tracking program.\n\n\"Many of those brands don't play (in the United States), but they're playing in places where they never played before.\"\n\nSUPPLIERS SUFFER\n\nIn its latest earnings this month, Apple shocked investors with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the holiday shopping quarter and with its announcement that it would stop reporting unit sales for its hardware products as has been customary for the last 20 years.\n\nUnderscoring flattening iPhone unit sales, it also said it sold 217.7 million iPhones in its most recent fiscal year, virtually unchanged from the year before and well below a high point of 231.2 million in fiscal 2015.\n\nIts share price, hit at the time of the forecast, has since extended losses after profit warnings from suppliers like Japan Display Inc <6740.T>, British chipmaker IQE Plc and Lumentum Holdings Inc . The stock is now down about 8 percent since its Nov. 1 earnings.\n\nApple declined to comment on the market moves. But its supply chain is vast, and the company's executives have warned investors in the past against fixating on sparse data points from it. And Apple has for more than a decade insisted that its gadgets should not be judged on their specs alone, an argument that sales data suggest Apple made successfully.\n\nApple's newest models such as the iPhone XS and iPhone XR are proving popular with its most loyal fans in wealthy economies. But they range up to $1,449 in price - out of reach for many consumers in less developed markets.\n\nApple's strategy is to lure those consumers to its eco-system with older models at cheaper prices. It has also emphasized that its phones are designed to last longer than the competition, expanded its repair options and crafted its most recent operating system update to speed up older devices.\n\nBut Chinese smartphone makers have been packing their phones with higher-end chips and features like under-the-glass fingerprint sensors that seek to lure consumers who might otherwise give Apple's phones a look.\n\nThose manufacturers are increasingly adopting Qualcomm's most powerful mobile phone chips, said Cristiano Amon, the head of chip operations at the U.S. chipmaker, which is locked in a bitter court dispute with Apple.\n\nThose phones were initially sold in China but \"we've also seen them gaining share outside China, especially in areas such as India and Europe,\" Amon said.\n\nOn its home turf, too, Apple is facing new challenges from at least one Chinese maker, OnePlus, which is creeping into the U.S. firm's traditional pricing territory.\n\nAfter years of being available in the United States only via an online store and developing a following among tech enthusiasts, the OnePlus 6T is being carried by T-Mobile US Inc stores.\n\nAt $549, it sits between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 in terms of pricing. Kyle Kiang, the general manager for North America for OnePlus, said sales are beating internal expectations so far, although he declined to disclose those figures.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Nick Zieminski)", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \"Digital Health Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Demand for Athenahealth's main software products has slowed \u2014 the firm hovered around 10% year-over-year revenue growth in each of the first three quarters of 2018, outpacing expectations but suffering a marked decline from previous growth rates.\n\nMoreover, the company's struggled to sustain growth in a market dominated by top EHR vendors like Cerner and Epic, accordi ng to Bloomberg. The company was also rocked by an unsolicited $7 billion acquisition bid from US hedge fund Elliott Management in May, and the June resignation of its former CEO Jonathan Bush amid controversy.\n\nBut the acquisition could give Athenahealth the turnaround it needs. Athenahealth could lean on Virence's services to ease providers' transition to VBC. The vast majority(79%) of US providers have a negative outlook on VBC, partly due to being overburdened by the time it takes to use EHRs to comply with data-reporting standards. Consolidating with Virence could allow Athenahealth to build out its EHR platform with a suite of VBC services, making its platform more valuable to healthcare providers.\n\nAthenahealth's struggles are indicative of a broader shift in the health IT market. As health systems begin to internalize data and analytics, EHR companies specializing in just a few core services will likely be pushed out of the market. Healthcare providers are demanding increasingly complex health IT solutions, and the successful players will be those that invest in ancillary services and partnerships that provide a full suite of solutions.", "Lawmakers in Congress plan to issue a bipartisan legislation to punish China over its persecution of the Uighurs, a majority-Muslim ethnic minority populated in the country's west.\n\nBeijing subjects the Uighurs to an unprecedented amount of surveillance in their home region of Xinjiang.

The green holiday exists for good reason: Recycling helps keep rubbish off the roads, reduces the need for Earth-scarring mining operations, and creates jobs.\n\nThe practice also keeps planet-warming carbon dioxide out of the air. Every ton of recycled aluminum cans (about 64,000 of them) keeps 10 tons of CO 2 out of the atmosphere, according to Popular Mechanics.\n\nBut recycling is no panacea for climate change.\n\nIf we hope to limit some of the disastrous effects of climate change, we must make drastic cuts\u2014 and soon \u2014 to greenhouse gas emissions in electricity production, transportation, industrial work, farming, and other sectors.\n\n\"There's no stopping global warming,\" Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist who is the director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies, previously told Business Insider. \"Everything that's happened so far is baked into the system.\"\n\nThat means that even if carbon emissions were to drop to zero tomorrow, we'd still be watching human-driven climate change play out for centuries. Even then, emissions aren't going to stop immediately. The key thing now, Schmidt said, is to slow climate change down enough to allow us to adapt as painlessly as possible.\n\nIn 2016, planet Earth's temperature averaged 1.26 degrees Celsius above preindustrial averages, which is dangerously close to the 1.5-degree-Celsius limit set by international policymakers in the Paris climate accord.\n\nNot exceeding that limit will be significantly more challenging, since President Donald Trump \u2014 who previously called climate change \"a hoax\" \u2014 plans to withdraw the US from the accord.

Amazon announced on Tuesday that the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens would host one-half of the tech giant's new headquarters, with the other half going to Arlington, Virginia.\n\nNew York has offered Amazon at least $1.525 billion in direct tax incentives, based on the 25,000 jobs the company promised to fill in the area, while Virginia has offered the company $573 million.\n\nNew Yorkers have had mixed reactions to the news, with critics voicing major concerns about the impact that Amazon's presence could have on the city. Politicians like Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov.

Meet Brooklittles, the smaller and gentler version of Brooklinen's already renowned bedding. And if you thought babies were cute, just wait until you see this baby collection.\n\nThe gender-neutral collection combines the same chic elegance that has become synonymous with the Brooklinen name with an even softer material that is gentle on baby's skin. From crib sheets to swaddles to toddler bedding to blankets, Brooklinen now has your baby covered from the moment they come home (and then some).\n\nI love the look of the mini crib sheet set ($32) and crib sheet set ($52), which will fit snuggly on your baby's first bed. Made of 100% long-staple cotton and OEKO-TEX certified chemical-free, these sheets are made in Israel and boast a particularly smooth sateen weave. And thanks to their deep pockets, you won't have to worry about the sheets coming off even if your baby tosses and turns. Really, once you've felt these sheets, you'll wonder why you ever outgrew your own crib. The set comes in four precious patterns, and I'm particularly taken with the New York City option (pictured above), which decorates your baby's sheets with little pizza slices, taxis, pretzels, and all things NYC.\n\nBrooklittles baby swaddle set, $38 Brooklinen\n\nThen, there's the toddler sheet set ($68) and complete toddler bed set ($188), made specifically for small beds (but not a crib). Like the crib set, these sheets are also made of 100% organic cotton in Israel, and are entirely hypoallergenic. The 400-thread-count sateen shell may introduce your child to the lap of luxury a bit too early, but hey, if you're going to spoil your child, might as well do it with bedding, right? The full bed set comes complete with a pillowcase, duvet cover, fitted sheet, comforter, and pillow, so you can take care of all bedding all at once. To avoid any hazardous conditions, there are no buttons to speak of on either the pillow case or the duvet cover (everything uses envelope enclosures and stitches to keep things in place), and both inserts and covers can be machine washed.\n\nMore precious still is the swaddle set ($38), which is constructed with 70% bamboo and 30% cotton. Incredibly soft and gentle, these three swaddle cloths are perfect for wrapping your newborn in what I imagine clouds must feel like. The combination of cotton and bamboo makes for an extremely delicate knit, so it's well-suited for even the most sensitive skin. While you certainly shouldn't leave these swaddle cloths in a crib, you could use them as burp cloths, stroller covers, or a nursing cover. And because they come in a set of three, you'll have a couple extra to keep around if baby loves one of them a little too much.\n\nBrooklittles baby quilt set, $128 Brooklinen\n\nFinally, there's the baby quilt set ($128), which comes with a quilt, a quilted sham, and a sham insert, all in white with grey stitching. Elegant and sophisticated, this is the pattern I wish I had on my own bed. And while the quilt may be more appropriate for summer months given its lightweight nature, for the winter months to come, you could always check out the alpaca baby blanket ($118), otherwise known as \"what I want for the holidays.\"\n\nHonestly, it's unfair that as we grow older, we're expected to grow out of our baby blankets, especially because this is one blanket I want to take with me everywhere. Made of 100% hypoallergenic baby alpaca sourced from the Andean Highlands, this 30-inch by 40-inch baby blanket is wrinkle resistant and super durable (so it really should last into adulthood) and unbelievably soft. Before the blanket ever gets to your doorstep, it's washed, softened, decatized, and combed for the ultimate in luxury, and with two classic colors (Cream Windowpane and Charcoal Windowpane), they'll elevate any nursery.\n\nAnd if you're looking for something else to go on your baby's bed that isn't a sheet or a blanket, you may want to check out my namesake, Lulu the Llama ($38). The cutest mascot around, this knit llama is apparently what the children of the 21st century are using instead of teddy bears.\n\nTo be honest, I think I'm ok with that.", "Meal kits have become one of the biggest trends in food retail in recent years, with dozens of new companies cropping up and even traditional retailers jumping on the bandwagon, hoping to cash in on time-strapped consumers who are seeking easy, healthy meals.\n\nBut the backlash has already begun. Some say the market is oversaturated with meal-kit options, and industry innovators such as Blue Apron have found themselves losing customers.\n\nTovala, a gourmet meal-kit service that uses a smart oven, is hoping to swoop in and woo these customers on the assumption that they still crave good food and convenience.\n\nThe Tovala oven is a countertop machine that combines four types of appliances: a broiler, a steamer, an oven, and a toaster. The oven is Wi-Fi-enabled and connects to an app with hundreds of recipes. The user simply needs to select a recipe on the app or scan the barcode on one of the service's prepared meals, and the oven will then do all of the work.\n\nIn February, Tovala received an undisclosed amount of funding from the food giant Tyson Foods. The capital raised was to be used to support Tovala's growth, including adding staff across all departments, geographic expansion, and investment in product, operations, technology, and marketing, Tovala said in a press release at the time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tovala launched its new and improved second-generation machine, which is lighter than its predecessor and has a new function that enables users to cook without using the app. The first machine was rolled out in 2017.\n\nFind out how it works below:", "Walmart and Microsoft have shared more details on their plans to team up and take on their mutual rivals at Amazon.\n\n\"We want to be the world's most trusted retailer,\" Fiona Tan, the senior vice president of customer technology and artificial intelligence at Walmart, said at a Microsoft event held this week.\n\nAt the event, Tan discussed how a Microsoft-Walmart engineering team would migrate the retailer's internal business applications to the Microsoft Azure cloud. She also announced plans to use Microsoft's AI technology in ways meant to improve online and in-store shopping.\n\nWalmart fiercely competes with Amazon for dominance in the retail sector, while Microsoft Azure is generally seen as the greatest rival to the market-leading Amazon Web Services cloud.\n\nTan said Walmart considered multiple options for AI technology but chose Azure because of Microsoft's track record in the field of AI.\n\n\"They had a good amount of research,\" Tan said. \"We've always had a good strong partnership with Microsoft. They have a lot of good tools. It's a good fit.\"\n\nWalmart plans to use Microsoft's AI technology to help with product search and recommendations on its recently revamped website. That tech could help Walmart provide more relevant recommendations to its customers on its site and improve customer experience, Tan said. It also wants to use AI to help scale its online grocery program and predict which groceries customers want to order.\n\nWith AI, Walmart can also figure out the best models to price an item, especially seasonal items, Tan said. Throughout the year, prices vary by location and availability, but AI can create models that predict these changes.\n\nIt's not just about pricing and online shopping though. Walmart plans to use Microsoft tech to improve one of its must futuristic initiatives: a robot that moves up and down the aisles to scan the shelves. The robot can recognize when people misplace items and alert associates to put the items on the right shelf.\n\nWith the robot also counting items on the shelves and making sure they're in stock, the human associates can focus on helping customers.\n\n\"Our associates can spend more time doing what they like to do, which is to sell products,\" Tan said. \"These are the kinds of things to allow them to have time to interact with our customers.\"\n\nRead more: Military work is a lightning rod in Silicon Valley, but Microsoft will sell the Pentagon all the AI it needs\n\nWalmart is also looking into voice commerce, which can be used in conjunction with assistants like the Google Home, Tan says. For example, a customer can tell a voice assistant to add milk to a shopping cart. This is in beta.\n\nThe robot is already being used in about 50 Walmart stores across the US, and Walmart plans to leverage Microsoft's AI technology to improve these bots.", "A record number of US citizens applied for asylum in Canada during 2017, the most since 1994.\n\nA total of 2,550 US citizens applied for asylum Canada in 2017 \u2014 six times more than in 2016, according to data from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada cited by The Guardian.\n\nThat's the largest number of applications Canada has ever received from American citizens since the dataset started reporting the numbers in 1994, they said.\n\nBut these Americans are not fleeing war, violence, or persecution like typical asylum seekers are.

He discovered that incompetence was the main cause of the crisis, and it was rooted in a toxic culture of bureaucracy and fear of communication.\n\nRecently, at the 2018 New York Times DealBook Conference, Barra told the Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin that the experience changed her leadership style, and in turn changed GM's culture. \"I've become much more impatient about how we do things and how quickly we do things,\" she said.\n\nRead more: How GM went from a government bailout and bankruptcy to being one of the world's best-run car companies a decade later\n\nBarra is a GM lifer, and spent 33 years at the automaker before becoming CEO. In her executive roles leading to the top job, she became familiar with the ways GM's more than 200,000 employees had become accustomed to a slow-moving, overly complicated culture that Business Insider's Matthew DeBord said \"was organized for conflict.\" When Barra was the head of HR in 2009, for example, she reduced a 10-page dress code into two words, \"Dress appropriately,\" empowering managers to interpret that for their particular team.\n\nIn the top role, overseeing the ignition switch crisis, she accelerated this impatience she had with arbitrary rules and processes that restricted employees and their managers. She needed to dismantle the decades-old culture that resulted in employees not voicing concerns and then committees dismissing concerns when they did arise \u2014 to fatal consequences.\n\nAt an internal town hall meeting in 2014, Barra told her company, according to Fortune, \"I never want to put this behind us. I want to put this painful experience permanently in our collective memories.\"\n\nShe also launched the \"Speak Up For Safety\" hotline as a way for employees to easily and quickly report concerns they have about vehicles. \"Because the best time to solve a problem is the minute you know about it,\" Barra told Sorkin. \"Most problems don't get smaller with time.\"\n\nBarra's leadership changed internal and external perceptions of the company. Her first year on the job, GM broke sales records despite the recall scandal. And while GM, with a frustrating lack of stock growth, is still working to prove itself to shareholders, there is no question that Barra has vastly improved the company's management.\n\nAs she told Sorkin, the ignition switch crisis taught her that the best leaders are transparent with their employees and clear about their expectations.\n\n\"We have 200,000 employees at General Motors \u2014 they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Just make sure they know you want them to do the right thing.\"", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

There's nothing wrong with them; they do one job, and they do it so well they can't do anything else \u2014 like look good.\n\nAnd yet, the merino wool sneakers that snagged the colloquial title of \"the world's most comfortable shoes\" also happened to be really cool looking. Where ergonomic clogs failed in Silicon Valley and New York City, Allbirds runners ($95) flourished with ease.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup knows how to make comfortable shoes that look good. And they opt to do so out of smart, eco-friendly materials: sneakers made from super-soft, merino wool, skippers made from eucalyptus pulp, and flip-flops made from the world's first-ever sugarcane EVA foam.\n\nAs of November 2018, Allbirds has combined all three of its cult-favorite materials into one shoe: the Tree Toppers ($115).\n\nThe classic high-tops have a sugarcane EVA foam for the sole, super-soft merino wool on the inside, and eucalyptus tree fiber on the outside. You can pick a pair up in four colors at the moment: two core colors of Kauri Jo and Charcoal, or two limited edition colors of Zin (red) and Fiddle Leaf (green).\n\nThe new Allbirds Tree Toppers are available in four colors. Allbirds\n\n$115 isn't cheap, but Allbirds are a particularly good place to invest that money if you're willing to buy fewer but better shoes. They're some of the most comfortable, low-maintenance pairs we've ever found, and you'll find at least one of our product viewers \u2014 people with more granular knowledge of products than is probably healthy \u2014 opting to wear one of its styles around the office every day. They travel well, feel good, and a purchase of one Allbirds pair also happens to support better, more sustainable business practices \u2014 as recently seen in the company's decision not to patent the world's first carbon-negative EVA foam so other companies could use it. It's also a bonus that you can throw them in the washing machine and they look like new again 30 minutes later.\n\nWe tested the Tree Toppers ahead of their November 14 launch, and we found them to be pretty great overall. The tree fiber is breathable and flexible, the sugarcane foam responsive and plush, and the super-soft merino wool is warm and comfortable for the interior. All in all, it's a great shoe \u2014 if you like the look, you won't be disappointed by the feel.\n\nShop the Tree Toppers here, or continue to our reviews for the men's and women's versions below:\n\nShown in Zin, $115 Allbirds\n\nAllbirds' Tree Toppers are probably the most comfortable pair of Allbirds I've tested \u2014 probably because they're essentially flexible, secure gloves made from all the materials that have made Allbirds famous.\n\nI was concerned the high-top style may feel stiff or unnaturally thick, but the tree fiber is responsive and flexible throughout \u2014 fitting close around my ankle without any of the chafing that you might expect from wearing ankle socks with high-tops for the first time. It feels effortless. The Tree fiber is as breathable as it was in the Tree Runners, the interior merino wool is still surprisingly soft, and the carbon-negative foam soles as sturdy and bouncy as any other. It's a good mix of the warm and cozy properties of the wool shoe and the light breeziness of the Tree collection. All in all, I love them. I'll probably wear them frequently into work, on the weekends, and for traveling.\n\nShown in Kauri Jo, $115 Allbirds\n\nDavid Slotnick, Insider Picks senior reporter: Men's Tree Topper, $115 (4 colors)\n\nI've been an Allbirds fan for a year or so. My Tree Runners were a summer staple, and I wear my Wool Runners pretty much any time I travel \u2014 they're breathable but warm and comfy, and they're just as well suited to a day walking around a city as they are to spending 10 hours in the air in an economy seat. They're not the best rain shoe, but they compare reasonably well to any other pair of sneakers.\n\nThe Tree Toppers feel like a comfortable middle ground, with the light airiness of the Tree Runners, but insulated enough to wear around on a drizzly November day in New York City. The high-top style lends well to jeans or even chinos, and they feel snug and supportive without sacrificing comfort.

Macy's is due to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday.\n\nThese smaller locations will have more self-service options, fewer cashiers, and areas to pick up or return online purchases.\n\nThis helps to trim the number of employees required. At one of the test stores, at the Stamford Town Center in Stamford, Connecticut, Macy's has pulled back on the number of employees \u2014 including cashiers \u2014 by 40%, The Journal reported.\n\nKohl's has used a similar strategy to fight back against the so-called retail apocalypse. Rather than close stores, it has opened smaller locations of about 35,000 square feet, or about one-sixth the size of a typical Macy's store, as well as shrunk several stores. Often, these spaces are not left empty but encompass other retailers like Aldi, a Kohl's partner.\n\nWhile Kohl's has largely been praised for this strategy and is now considered an industry anomaly, reporting same-stores sales growth in recent months while its competitors have been forced to close stores, some experts say that shrinking stores is not a solution but evidence that a retailer is not resonating with customers.\n\n\"If you've got too much space, it means your brand isn't resonating,\" Steve Dennis, a former executive at Sears and Neiman Marcus, told The Journal. \"It's not a real-estate problem \u2014 it's a brand problem.\"\n\nMacy's is also investing in some of its more profitable locations, launching virtual-reality shopping technologies and rolling out concepts such as The Market @ Macy's, a pop-up store-in-a-store that stocks lesser-known brands.\n\nRead more: Facebook is launching pop-up stores at Macy's in a move that's straight out of Amazon's playbook\n\nGennette said he believes investment in stores now is crucial after the company took its eye off brick-and-mortar locations to ramp up its e-commerce strategy.\n\n\"We were spending the capital and gaining market share in digital,\" Gennette told The Journal. \"But we underinvested in brick-and-mortar.

Those concerns weighed on Maersk's share price, with the stock falling about 0.7%.\n\nGlobal container trade continued to lose momentum in the third quarter. And so far this year, it has suffered \"a much slower pace of growth,\" rising by 4.2% compared with the 5.8% recorded over the same period in 2017, Maersk said.\n\nTrade tariffs may end up stifling global container shipping by as much as 2% in the next two years. The company estimates that those tariffs make up about 2.6% of the global value of traded goods.\n\nTrade restrictions introduced this year could reduce global container trade by 0.5% to 2% next year and in 2020, the company said.\n\nRead more: One of China's most senior officials is said to be headed to the US to try to diffuse Trump's trade war\n\nThe US has introduced tariffs of 10% to 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods entering the US, prompting Chinese policymakers to retaliate, albeit on a smaller scale.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly threatened to place tariffs on all US imports from China, an amount totaling more than $500 billion annually \u2014 a move that would most likely slow global trade significantly.\n\nHe has also considered placing large tariffs on US auto imports, a threat the administration has since shelved.\n\nMaersk's warning is not the first time the shipping giant has weighed in on the trade war. CEO Soren Skou said in August, before Trump hit swathes of consumer goods with levies, that the fallout from the tariffs \"could easily end up being bigger in the US.\"\n\nDuring a presentation at Maersk's global headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark, Skou said that the negative effect on US trade could be as high as 4% \u2014 and particularly acute if tariffs end up being more consumer-focused.\n\n\"The first thing the American importers would do if tariffs are put on Chinese consumer goods would be to buy in Vietnam, in Indonesia, or elsewhere in Asia,\" Skou said, adding, \"It will end up being pushed on to the consumer.\"", "No matter how you look at it, the relationship between the US and China is historically fraught.\n\nPerhaps the highest-profile example is the trade skirmish that's broken out between the two countries. President Donald Trump has employed tactics that his Chinese counterparts have characterized as \"bullying,\" and the two sides have levied massive tariffs on each other.\n\nThere's also a burgeoning currency war that's seen the US Treasury question China's devaluation of the renminbi. It's an extension of the trade battle \u2014 since a weaker currency provides a boost to exports \u2014 and the tension around it seems to be escalating all the time.\n\nAnd then there's the ruthless battle for supremacy that is playing out in the tech sector.\n\nA recent report from Bloomberg suggested that Chinese spies were using tiny microchips to spy on US firms \u2014 something that was roundly denied by authorities in China.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese titan Alibaba has opted against nefarious action and is dominating the old-fashioned way: through good old-fashioned product sales. The company's massive Singles Day promotion generated $30.8 billion in revenue in just 24 hours, nearly tripling every US company's 2017 Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales combined.\n\nSo who has the upper hand? If you go strictly by stock prices, US tech firms seem to be winning by a landslide, at least lately.\n\nAs the chart below shows, US tech companies are outperforming their Chinese counterparts to the largest extent since 2004. Strategists at BlackRock say this is largely because of the downward revisions to Chinese tech earnings, combined with peak profit growth in the US.\n\nBlackrock\n\nBut BlackRock also notes that this type of divergence is setting the stage for a reversion back to historical norms \u2014 which would mean a significant comeback for Chinese tech firms.\n\nThe chart below shows just how much latent upside may already exist in Chinese stocks. After all, their historical premium versus US stocks is close to its lowest in 10 years and definitively at its weakest level since 2011. BlackRock\n\n\"We see China's focus on domestic demand and a strategic commitment to self-reliance as potential positives amid trade disputes,\" Kate Moore, the chief equity strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute, said in a client note. \"U.S. tech earnings, meanwhile, are expected to normalize after a boost from 2018 tax cuts.\"\n\nBut even if Chinese tech stocks end up closing the gap that has formed between them and their US peers, BlackRock still sees ample chances to make money on both sides.

Negotiators made a breakthrough on the issue of the Irish border after months of impasse.\n\nBrexit-supporting ministers of the Cabinet, particularly Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, are under pressure from pro-Brexit Conservative MPs to take a stand against May's deal, or even resign from their roles in government.\n\nA member of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Tories told Business Insider they were \"absolutely shellshocked\" that May had kept \"none of the promises\" she had made to the group of around 80 passionate Leavers.\n\nThey added that pro-Brexit members of the Cabinet \"who campaigned with us [ERG MPS] should make sure this deal never reaches the House of Commons\" for a meaningful vote this winter.\n\nPro-Brexit Conservative MPs including former Tory party leader Iain Duncan Smith, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and ERG leader Jacob Rees-Mogg all described the deal as unacceptable.\n\nFormer Brexit Secretary David Davis tweeted: \"This is the moment of truth.

Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nSuperpowers jostling for position\n\nChina, Australia, Japan and the US have all thrown down the gauntlet in the stampede to embed themselves in regional infrastructure projects and aid funding.\n\nOn Thursday, Australia pledged $3 billion in what has been called Prime Minister Scott Morrison's \"Pacific Pivot.\"\n\nOn Friday, that pivot segued into a trilateral project as China pushed for cooperation and not competition in the Pacific.\n\nOver the weekend, as Vice President Mike Pence makes his circuitous way to Moresby (via Cairns) he is reported to be carrying the prototype of America's Indo-Pacific strategy, rumored to be based on $60 billion in regional assistance.\n\nKyodo News of Japan reports the $60 billion announcement is a bid to diminish China's rising influence through the extension of its One Belt One Road development strategy.\n\nThe final piece of the Pacific puzzle, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will this Saturday, fly into Port Moresby's Chinese-built Jackson airport to share his two yen at the APEC summit.\n\nLikewise, Abe will be visiting friends and striving to bind new allegiances to counter China's successes in the Pacific, from the South China Seas to Fiji.\n\nSo, with new acquaintances to make and money for sale, Port Moresby's flourishing corruption and eye level impoverishment will be the more than appropriate backdrop for the 21 world leaders' awkwardly iconic fashion shoots that traditionally close out the summit.\n\nRead more: The South China Sea is fabled for its hidden energy reserves and China wants to block outsiders like the US from finding them\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping inspects troops at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Hong Kong Garrison in one of events marking the 20th anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule, in Hong Kong Damir Sagolj/Reuters\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has a head start\n\nIn fairly contrasting optics, Xi will arrive and stay in Moresby for a full state visit, the first by any Chinese president.\n\nThe US President Donald Trump isn't attending at all.\n\nBut Pence has decided that rather than stay in Port Moresby at all, he will fly in and out of Cairns in Northern Australia, a 180-minute commute.\n\nDuring his historic stay, Xi will attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting from November 17 to 18 and he will also meet the eight leaders of the Pacific Island countries that have diplomatic ties with China.\n\nXi will then continue on to Brunei and the Philippines shoring up relations there, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang.\n\nChina has also responded to concerns of its growing debt diplomacy in the region.\n\n\"China has no intention to touch the cheese of any country, instead China is committed to make the pie of cooperation larger,\" Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs Zheng Zeguang said on Tuesday.\n\n\"No country should try to obstruct the friendship and cooperation,\" Zheng said when asked about the expansion of Australian aid in the Pacific.\n\nThen in a fairly extraordinary opinion piece published on Wednesday in the Papua New Guinea Post-Courier, and addressed to the people of PNG, Xi Jinping spoke of the \"rapid growth of China-Papua New Guinea relations is an epitome of China's overall relations with Pacific island countries.\"\n\nThe president said that first off China and the islands \"need to bring our strategic trust to a higher level.\"\n\n\"China will stand firm with Pacific island countries and all other developing countries. Following a policy of pursuing the greater good and shared interests under the principles of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, China will enhance solidarity and cooperation with Pacific island countries, support their development, and help narrow down the development gap between the North and the South.\"\n\n\"China will work with Pacific island countries to build a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind.\"\n\nRead more: Australia's new prime minister sounds like he wants to take on China's growing influence in the South Pacific\n\nHowever welcome the intent, the goals are not so easy to kick in a region beset by inequality, poverty and corruption.\n\nTo the chagrin of most observers and a small contingent of striking workers, PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill has gone on a bit of a wild spending spree ahead of the summit.\n\nWith a tight budget, some workers downed tools when Maseratis began arriving in numbers at Jackson International airport, brought in for the leaders.\n\nDespite more than one-third (37%) of his country according to the UN Development Program living way down below the poverty line, O'Neill decided to welcome leaders with several Bentleys and the extra 40 luxury Maseratis specifically flown in for the meetings.\n\nPNG, which is the one nation (aside from the wayward Australian state of Victoria) signed up to China's One Belt One Road initiative, has been a key beneficiary of Chinese investment and many of it's infrastructure projects will be in display in Port Moresby.\n\nBeijing has fixed bits of the airport, had a crack at some transport infrastructure without enormous progress, donated a squad of fire trucks, somewhere near 50 coaches and 35 mini-buses to shuttle officials to and from the a $35 million convention center built with Chinese money by Chinese companies and workers.\n\nDr. Graeme Smith, a research fellow at the Australian National University's Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs told Business Insider that it is likely China has invested somewhere around double the $3 billion it is rumored to have staked in PNG.\n\nTo keep its hands clean in a time of added scrutiny, neighboring Australia, PNG's biggest aid-donor and former colonial power broker, is not providing any direct financial assistance for the APEC summit, but is flexing its security muscle and military ties, providing assistance to the tune of $130 million of APEC's total costs.\n\nSome 4,000 members of the PNG disciplinary forces and their international counterparts will be patrolling the city for the summit, including 1,500 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel supporting PNG's Joint Security Task Force, with just under 500 of those on the ground in Port Moresby.\n\nFor back up, Australia has mobilized up to 16 Super Hornet aircraft to be based near Cairns and three Royal Navy ships are stationed off Port Moresby, accompanied by one helicopter landing dock and several patrol boats.\n\nA worker adjusts a rope line outside of APEC Haus, the main venue of the APEC Economic Leaders' Week Summit as a military ship is anchored just offshore in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018. AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein\n\nSo who's there this year?\n\nAlmost 30 years old, APEC began in 1989, to encourage tighter regional economic integration for the Pacific Rim.\n\nMost of the 21 APEC members are from this pacific region with the addition of Russia, United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru, together accounting for 2.7 billion people \u2014 more than a third of the world's population.\n\nHeadlining in 2018 is undoubtedly China's Xi Jinping.\n\nJapan's Abe, Canada's Justin Trudeau, South Korea's Moon Jae-in and New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern will also be there alongside the new Australian leader Scott Morrison.\n\nWhile Pence is standing-in for Trump, so too will Vladimir Putin's proxy, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, fly the Russian flag.\n\nWorkers put up a billboard reading \"The world is watching, keep our city clean an safe\" on a wall along a street ahead of the APEC Economic Leaders' Week Summit in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, Wednesday, Nov. 14, 2018. AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein\n\nPutting Papua New Guinea on the map\n\nPNG's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill says he expects $85 million will be spent by leaders during the time of APEC alone and that playing host will put PNG on the map.\n\nO'Neill, whose first move as prime minister was to scrap the anti-corruption body Taskforce Sweep that ushered him into power and then began looking into his own affairs, has allocated around $350 million for the event.\n\nResponding to some of the considerable flak that has come his way, O'Neill says PNG is in fact hosting the cheapest APEC meeting compared to other countries.\n\nO'Neill said PNG is on the cusp of hosting one of the cheapest APEC Leaders meetings in history.\n\n\"We were given the green light to host APEC in October 2016 and in the same year, we budgeted ($US7.5 million) K25 million towards APEC.\"\n\nThat seems unlikely considering the summit's APEC house centerpiece is thought to have cost $75 million alone.\n\nStephen Howes, the Director of the Development Policy Centre and Professor of Economics in the Crawford School of Public Policy, ANU says the timing is not so great for a PNG facing mounting debts and rising corruption.\n\n\"Excessive borrowing in the boom years has now come back to haunt the government following a collapse in revenue,\" wrote in the ANU's East Asia Forum.\n\nBut in the second most rural country worldwide, Howes added that there is a stronger, more damning indicator for how things are faring in PNG.\n\nWhat has really caught the public's attention is the return of polio, previously eliminated from PNG about 20 years ago.\n\n\"PNG is one of only five countries in the world experiencing a polio comeback.\"\n\n\"That the other members of this club are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Nigeria and Somalia \u2014 all four wrought by violence \u2014 shows the extent of the health crisis that PNG is facing,\" Howes said.\n\n\"The most recent symptoms of this crisis include the resurgence of malaria and leprosy, and reports of worsening drug shortages.\"\n\nAustralian freelance journalist Jo Chandler herself contracted drug-resistant tuberculosis while investigating the growing crisis.\n\nSo what does Howes expect will come of PNG's APEC?\n\nAPEC he says will deliver a mild economic stimulus, and is expected to be accompanied by a round of \"announceables.\"\n\nThis is perhaps more likely than ever as the four regional pacific powers make their various bids for lasting influence.\n\n\"These may come from China or resource projects. Perhaps PNG will get more aid, but any resource project agreements will be ones that were already in the pipeline.\n\nHowes says that it is widely accepted (including by the government) that PNG needs to get a better deal from its resource projects. Rushing agreements so that they can be announced at APEC only weakens PNG's negotiating hand.\n\n\"By the same token though, APEC is meant to be about reform and development. PNG could have used its hosting of APEC to push through important change in a range of critical policy areas. It hasn't.\"\n\n\"Whatever happens at the leaders' meeting this year, in this fundamental sense APEC 2018 is a lost opportunity for its host.\"", "Hello! Here's what's happening on Wednesday.\n\n1.

Drugs. Murder. A vast global narcotics trafficking organization,\" said Assistant US Attorney Adam Fels. \"That is what this case is about.\"\n\nGuzman, 61, is accused of leading what prosecutors said became \"the largest drug trafficking organization in the world\" between 1989 and 2014, smuggling 155 metric tons of cocaine and other drugs and making $14 billion.\n\nGuzman himself faces 17 criminal counts and, if convicted, a life sentence.\n\nRecaptured drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman escorted by soldiers at the airport in Mexico City, after being recaptured in Mexico, January 8, 2016. Thomson Reuters\n\nFels said Guzman got a modest start in the 1970s, selling marijuana in Mexico before starting to build tunnels into the US. The tunnels distinguished Guzman, allowing him to move large quantities of drugs with such speed that he earned a new nickname, \"Rapido,\" or the quick one.\n\nGuzman was soon sending 10 to 15 planes \"stuffed with cocaine\" a day from Colombia to Mexico, where the drugs could be smuggled into the US, according to Fels. With business booming, Fels said, Guzman started taking aim at rivals, kicking off several bloody turf wars in the 1990s.\n\nRead also: 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n has pleaded not guilty \u2014 here's the case US prosecutors say they have against him\n\nAfter the 1993 killing of Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, who was gunned down in Guadalajara in what is believed to have been an attempt to kill Guzman, the rising trafficker fled to Guatemala, where he was captured, returned to Mexico, and convicted on drug and murder charges.\n\nBut he continued to run his cartel for eight years before the first of two successful escapes.\n\nA helicopter arrives to where seven men were killed in a shootout in a marijuana field, south of Sinaloa state capital, Culiacan, July 14, 1999.

Saudi Arabia has repeatedly shifted its version of the events that transpired that day, and it has fired five top officials and arrested 18 Saudis it says are connected to the killing.\n\nStill, Khashoggi's body has not been returned, and audio recordings circulating around government agencies appear to indicate that that someone senior, possibly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had ordered the killing.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the tape allegedly records Khashoggi's last moments, and catches one of his killers call his superior on the phone and tell the person to \"tell your boss\" that \"the deed was done.\"\n\n\"The way Saudi Arabia is run today, Mohammed bin Salman is an autocrat,\" Baer said. \"Security services, the rest of the country, he's in control.\"\n\nWhile Turkish and US officials, including US National Security Adviser John Bolton, have said that the audio does not conclusively implicate Prince Mohammed, Baer suggested it is unlikely that anyone else in the Kingdom would have the authority to order such an operation.

China for example likes to say it has historical roots to the region established sometime back in the 15th century.\n\nBut their are many other aggravating maritime and territorial factors in this increasingly dangerous part of the world.\n\nAs ASEAN's economic intensity has continued to build under the shade of China's decades-long economic boom, so has the waterway become a critical channel for a growing percentage of global commercial merchant shipping.\n\nChina itself still depends heavily on access through the Malacca Straits to satiate its appetite for energy and resources.\n\nNearby Japan and South Korea, both net importers, also depend enormously on free access to the South China Sea for unhindered shipments of fuel, resources and raw materials for both import and export.\n\nOn top of that, these are oceans rich and unregulated when it comes to natural resources. Nations like Vietnam and China furiously compete through fleets of private fishing vessels organised with state backing in a rush to exploit fishing grounds in dire need of governance.\n\nYet, the source of the most intense friction is the widely held belief that the South China Seas are home to abundant, as yet undiscovered oil and gas reserves.\n\nChina and ASEAN have been discussing changes to a 2002 declaration on the peaceful resolution of disputes in the South China Sea that would give the rules legal force.\n\nAs it stands, the declaration has proved wholly unable to stop Chinese island-building in the waters.\n\nThe Spratly Islands, where China has been reclaiming land and building strategic assets, 2016 Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative/CSIS\n\nSouth China Sea nations including China, Vietnam and the Philippines seek opportunities to develop the plentiful reserves of energy that the sea is thought to hold.\n\nBut with the notable exception of China, backed by its heaving state-owned behemoths, like Sinopec and CNOOC these countries independently lack well-developed oil industries.\n\nWhich is where the US enters the frame.\n\nBeijing has obvious and probably well founded concerns that the US will seek to engage and then use joint oil development projects with ASEAN countries to build a legitimate commercial toehold and thus a greater presence in the sea.\n\nThe Nikkei Review noted that the South China Sea's lack of clear maritime boundaries makes it a difficult place to ban oil exploration by outside countries, according to a specialist in international law.\n\nAs part of the code of conduct, China has also proposed barring outside countries from taking part in joint military exercises with ASEAN countries in the South China Sea.\n\nASEAN members including Singapore have not agreed to this provision, creating another obstacle to concluding the negotiations.\n\nASEAN is moving to strengthen ties with China, as shown by last month's first-ever joint military exercises. At the same time, the Southeast Asian bloc plans to hold naval exercises with the US as early as next year.\n\nMeanwhile, this week Chinese president Xi Jinping will travel to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea to meet with the leaders of the eight Pacific islands that recognise China diplomatically and welcome Chinese investment.\n\nBeijing this week warned no country should try to obstruct its \"friendship and cooperation\" with Pacific nations that have already received over $3 billion in Chinese investment.", "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Tesla co-founder Elon Musk and Mexico's tequila producers could be headed for a collision after the agave-based drink's industry group opposed the flamboyant billionaire's efforts to trademark an alcoholic drink dubbed \"Teslaquila.\"\n\nOne of the world's richest people and chief executive of Tesla, Musk is known for ambitious and cutting-edge projects ranging from auto electrification and rocket-building to high-speed transit tunnels.\n\nNow it seems that Musk could be setting his sights on disrupting the multibillion-dollar tequila industry.\n\nOn Oct. 12, he tweeted \"Teslaquila coming soon\" and an accompanying \"visual approximation\" of a red and white label with the Tesla logo and a caption that stated \"100 percent Puro de Agave.\"\n\nNot so fast, said Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council.

America is unanimous on one thing: Florida botched it again.\n\nWhy is Florida such a perennial nightmare when it comes to election administration? There are three reasons.\n\nFlorida, like most of the US, doesn't invest enough in its elections\n\nIn 1999, the Broward County Supervisor of Elections had the equivalent of 60 full-time employees, a number that rose to 80 by 2006. That hiring spree coincided with the aftermath of the 2000 election, which cemented Florida's place in the annals of electoral cautionary tales. But the staff fell back down to 72 employees by 2017.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2017, Florida introduced early voting, and the population of Broward itself rose 20% from 1.6 million residents to 1.9 million.\n\nBut when you adjust for inflation, the $18.2 million spent by the Broward County Supervisor of Elections in 2017 is lower than the inflation-adjusted $19.2 million spent in 2005. That holds statewide: Setting aside the erratic spending on public campaign finance and constitutional amendments, the $3.2 million spent on elections by the state in the 2017-18 fiscal year is lower than the inflation-adjusted $3.9 million spent in the 2009-10 year.\n\nState governments are trying to keep lean, but the demands on local election officials \u2014 new technology, higher populations, more early voting, and meddling by foreign adversaries \u2014 aren't getting easier. And eventually, states get exactly what they pay for.\n\nThe federal government is dispersing $380 million to states and territories to bolster cybersecurity, but in Florida their funding only first showed up in July. Broward County received $1.16 million of the $14.6 million Florida has allocated.\n\nFlorida's county supervisors of elections are elected politicians, not civil servants\n\nIn Florida, there is no guarantee that the people who run elections at the county level are going to excel at the job. This is because while most states either appoint civil servants or have groups of people overseeing local elections, Florida's laws more closely resemble the preferred electoral policies of the \"Wild West.\"\n\nIn the United States, the actual management of elections is typically handled at the county and local level. In 10 states, those are managed by a Board of Elections. In 18 states, those duties are balanced between two or more offices \u2014 perhaps one running the day-to-day voter-registration requirements, while the other specializes in the day-of implementation of an election.\n\nIn 22 states, the responsibility and power of managing a local election rests on a single official. Florida is one of these states. Here is a map compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures:\n\nHow different states select their local election administrator. NCSL\n\nThere's another wrinkle:\n\nIn eight of those 22 states, the local election supervisors are civil servants appointed to run elections.\n\nIn 16 states, they're simply elected. Florida is one of those.\n\nSome states realize that larger municipalities need more reliable management \u2014 Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin have appointees manage elections in the largest, most-populous counties.\n\nIn Florida, only Miami-Dade County has an appointed official. (Miami-Dade is the county that counted its votes in a timely fashion and is surrounded by counties that did not.)\n\nWhen it comes to having elected, unchecked, and unassisted administrators, Florida stands with Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. This brings us to the third reason.\n\nFlorida has several counties larger than entire states\n\nNone of those other states have been deciding presidential races lately.\n\nMiami-Dade County alone is larger than each of those states, with the exception of Utah. Broward alone has about the population of Idaho, and Palm Beach has more people than Montana.\n\nPut together, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties would be the 21st-largest state in the country. When dealing with populations of that magnitude, and with Florida's consistent position as a consequential, if not absolutely essential, swing state, you're going to have tight races.\n\nWhat's more: While 42 states acknowledge or require some federally recommended voting-system standards, Florida is one of the eight states that do not. In Florida, training for local election officials is voluntary, with the only incentive to train being a pay bump.\n\nAs a result, Florida has a perfect storm of electoral mayhem:\n\nIt's always important.\n\nIt's usually very close in statewide races.\n\nAnd it has several counties the size of states.\n\nWhile other large and consequential states have election boards, appointed civil servants or multiple offices with defined responsibilities, Florida pretty much wings it.\n\nThe people overseeing those county-level elections are themselves elected and are not required to be good at their job by the state of Florida.\n\nAnd even if they were all stellar luminaries of electoral administration, the budgets and personnel levels they have to work with are stuck in the 20th century just as the challenges they have to deal with are getting smarter and more well-funded.\n\nIt's somewhat surprising it doesn't end in multiple simultaneous recounts more often.", "An official, verified Twitter account for Google's G Suite was hacked by scammers seeking to bilk innocent people out of their bitcoin \u2014 making it the latest victim in a scourge that the social network can't quite stamp out.\n\nSent Tuesday afternoon, a tweet from the G Suite account shared information about the \"biggest crypto-giveaway in the world,\" which followers could access by first sending over some bitcoin of their own.

Vick declared for the 2018 NBA Draft, and Self heavily recruited Romeo Langford \u2014 the No. 5 player in the Class of 2018 ESPN 100 \u2014 to take his place.\n\nWhen it became clear that he would not get drafted, Vick withdrew his name and thought about taking his talents to the G League or overseas. He also considered transferring to another top college basketball program, but playing another season with the Jayhawks seemed completely out of the realm of possibility.\n\n\"We like Lagerald, and certainly the thought was, when he declared, that his time at KU would be done either way,\" Self said, per Scott Chasen of 247 Sports. \"We recruited with the idea of him not being here. We signed a young man late with the idea of him not being here.\"\n\nBut the Hall of Fame coach and his veteran guard eventually met and put whatever bad blood they had behind them. Vick expressed a genuine interest in returning to Lawrence and convinced Self to take another chance on him. When Langford chose Indiana, Kansas' final scholarship was officially Vick's for the taking.\n\nSo far, it looks like the arrangement has worked out for both parties.\n\nThe Jayhawks' lone senior erupted for a career-high 32 points on 12-of-14 shooting from the floor against the Vermont Catamounts Monday night. He shot a perfect 8-for-8 from beyond the arc and sank two more field goals with his foot on the three-point line for what constituted the greatest shooting performance in Kansas program history.\n\nAnd it wasn't just his long-range shooting that made Monday's performance so spectacular. Nearly every aspect of Vick's game was on full display in his 33 minutes on the floor.\n\n\"Well, he was great,\" Self said postgame. \"I tried to remember, I don't think I've ever coached a better offensive performance ever. I mean, he missed a 3-foot jump hook that was a great shot and he missed a dipsy-do layup.\"\n\nSelf was right. The closest he had ever come to was when Ben McLemore set the previous record back in January of 2013, hitting 6-of-6 3-point attempts to lift the Jayhawks past the Iowa State Cyclones in an overtime affair.\n\nOn a team chock full of incredible talent, Vick's shooting ability stood out to his head coach even before his incredible showing Monday night.\n\n\"Lagerald, I think, has been our best shooter,\" Self told Tom Keegan of KUSports.com before the season began. \"If he can stay focused and hungry and humble, I think he's going to have a really, really nice senior year.\"", "Scientists have long warned that New York City is at risk of chronic flooding. Due to its dense population and coastal location, the city has more residents living in high-risk flood zones than any other city in the US.\n\nThat's bad news for Amazon, which recently opted to locate half of its second headquarters in Long Island City, Queens. The company intends to build a 4 million to 8 million square-foot development directly along the flood zone in Long Island City. If sea levels continue to rise as predicted, that development may not last for more than a couple decades.\n\nNew research from Climate Central and the real estate site Zillow suggests that Queens County (where Long Island City is located) could see coastal flooding as early as 2020. The risk becomes more acute with time.\n\nUnder the most extreme projections of sea level rise, the researchers find a 100% likelihood that Queens will witness coastal flooding by 2050, meaning many of its low-lying buildings will be submerged in water. Even under moderate projections, parts of the county \u2014 including major waterfront developments \u2014 could be flooded by 2080, much sooner than scientists originally anticipated.\n\nOn the afternoon of the company's HQ2 announcement, Citibank said it was removing 1,100 of its employees from One Court Square, a 50-story office tower, to make way for Amazon. The company is reportedly using One Court Square as a temporary space while it constructs a new development in the Anable Basin, an artificial inlet that separates Brooklyn from Queens.\n\nBased on Climate Central data, that new development could be partially underwater by 2050, as shown on the map below.\n\nClimate Central\n\nBy 2100, the area would most certainly be flooded, according to the Climate Central predictions.\n\nClimate Central\n\nAmazon is following in the footsteps of buyers and renters across the country by taking a major risk on a waterfront property. By the time the new development is finished in 15 years, there's a 45% chance that flooding will already have arrived in Queens.\n\nIn 93 years of recorded history, Queens County has already witnessed a foot of sea level rise \u2014 a level that increases both the likelihood and severity of future floods. From 2005 to 2014, Queens saw an additional 31 days of coastal flooding due to climate change.\n\nIf Queens were to experience a six-foot flood (the level anticipated by scientists by the end of the century), it could endure $13 billion worth of property damage \u2014 the equivalent of 34,000 damaged homes.", "One of the marquee games of the NFL season has officially been moved.\n\nThis week's \"Monday Night Football\" match was supposed to pit the Los Angeles Rams against the Kansas City Chiefs at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, part of the NFL's International Series meant to spread the sport's appeal abroad.\n\nThe NFL announced that the game will be moved to Los Angeles to ensure the safety of the players, some of whom were reportedly threatening to sit the game out due to the horrendous state of the field.\n\nOn Monday, reports said the field conditions at Azteca Stadium were terrible due to rain and the heavy use the venue in recent days. According to Peter King, the NFL sent officials to see \"if surgery will be needed on the field before the game.\"\n\nEven to the untrained eye, it was clear that the field was a long way away from being ready to host an NFL game.\n\nThings escalated from there, with ESPN's Adam Schefter reporting that there were players on both teams were ready to sit the game out due to safety concerns.\n\n\"It's not fair to risk our health,\" Schefter reported one prominent player telling him.\n\nWhile groundskeepers were busy resodding the field on Tuesday, it wasn't enough.\n\nSchefter never specified any players he spoke with that were considering sitting the game out, but Rams safety John Johnson was not subtle about his feelings on the matter, tweeting out a story about the field's condition with a caption reading only, \"THAT'S OUT.\"\n\nEventually, the NFL avoided the problem, and chose to move the game to Los Angeles. According to NFL rules, teams giving up a home game to play internationally keep their stadium open just in case a situation like this pops up, and the Rams were the scheduled home team.\n\nWhile the move out of Mexico City isn't what the league hoped for, it appears to be the correct move given the circumstances. The Chiefs and the Rams both have Super Bowl potential this season, and risking any of their players by having them run out on a field that didn't meet standards was a disaster waiting to happen.", "Thousands of active-duty US troops have deployed to the US-Mexico border to support border agents as large migrant caravans march through Mexico, the first of which began to reach border towns Tuesday.\n\nThe troops are building barriers and hardening ports of entry, but the US military says it does not have a clear plan for what to do when the migrants finally arrive, raising new questions about the large-scale troop deployments that President Trump has ordered.\n\nThe Pentagon referred INSIDER to US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) for questions on US military activity at the southern border, and NORTHCOM redirected BI to Army North, which is officially in charge of the mission formerly called \"Operation Faithful Patriot.\"\n\nArmy North said on Tuesday that there is no specific plan or guidance for when the migrants arrive. Media reports said the first wave of about one hundred migrants began to arrive near Tijuana on Tuesday. Thousands more are presently located near Guadalajara and Veracruz, Mexico.\n\nWhen asked whether or not someone higher up had a plan, Army North spokeswoman First Lt.

Mattis responded to these accusations, saying, \"We don't do stunts in this department.\"\n\nThe day after the election, the operation ceased to be called \"Operation Faithful Patriot.\" Pentagon officials instead call the mission \"border support.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has characterized the approaching caravans as an \"invasion,\" and CBP has stressed that these caravans \"are larger than we've seen in the past.\" CBP says the military is hardening points of entry, as well as offering an extra set of eyes on potential security gaps.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Green challenged Durant on the issue, according to Charania, as teammates confronted Green about his late-game blunder.\n\nBoth ESPN and The Athletic reported that the Warriors have been dealing with the issue on Tuesday.\n\nDurant can become a free agent at the end of the season and his intentions this coming summer are unknown, even to those close to him. Durant has not confirmed that he will re-sign with the Warriors but hasn't suggested he would leave, either.\n\nHere was their on-court exchange:\n\nThe issue of free agency is a sensitive one to Durant, though. He faced major backlash after leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Warriors in 2016. He recently told The Los Angeles Times' Dan Woike that he doesn't think teammates should even discuss free agency because it's so personal.\n\n\"That's business. We don't get into anyone else's business,\" Durant told Woike. \"There's money involved in that stuff. Everything is involved, your life is involved, free agency, a new contract. I don't think guys overstep those boundaries when it comes to that. We don't even play around about that because we're so locked in on the season.\"\n\nThe Warriors have had dust-ups before. Green and head coach Steve Kerr famously had a shouting match and had to be separated during the 2015-16 over Kerr's criticism of Green's shot selection. Green and Durant also got into it in Durant's first season with the Warriors when Green felt Durant wasn't playing in the system in a close game.", "LinkedIn wants to be the go-to platform for brands to talk to both employees and potential hires, and it's rolling out a bunch of new tools to help them.\n\nAs of Tuesday, admins to pages can now manage their accounts and respond to comments through LinkedIn's mobile app. They can also now plug in hashtags to target specific keywords and use a new feature that pulls in trending content they can use to target their own content.\n\nLinkedIn announced that it has 590 million members, more than 30 million company pages, and generates more than 2 million pieces of content in its newsfeed every day. Video in particular is growing, the company said, and 50% of members see a video in their newsfeeds daily.\n\nRead more: LinkedIn wants to be more than where you look for jobs \u2014 so it's taking a big page from Facebook's playbook\n\nLinkedIn's revenue from advertising is small but still growing.\n\nDuring a press event on Tuesday, Tomer Cohen, vice president of product at LinkedIn Marketing Services, said LinkedIn's media business that sells advertising will hit $2 billion in revenue this year.\n\nTo compare, Facebook made $13.7 billion during the third quarter of 2018, while Google pulled in $27.2 billion. Amazon, which many industry observers say is an emerging threat to the duopoly, made $2.5 billion from advertising during the third quarter, up from $2 billion in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nBusiness Insider talked with Cohen about LinkedIn's ad business and how the company sees brands using its platform.\n\nLauren Johnson: LinkedIn is expecting $2 billion in media revenue for 2018. How does that break down between sponsored content and video?\n\nTomer Cohen: We don't break it down [but] sponsored content is our dominant advertising unit. It's propelling our newsfeed engagement. LinkedIn Pages have been redesigned. LinkedIn You're seeing an increase in sessions, close to up to 60% year-over-year on mobile \u2014 that leads to more people coming back to the newsfeed and consuming more.\n\nJohnson: Video has also been growing on LinkedIn. How does engagement with video compare with text?\n\nCohen: More than 50% of members on LinkedIn see a video in their feed on a daily basis. We just launched video several quarters ago on the consumer side and two quarters ago on the advertiser side.\n\nMembers want to express themselves [with] video. Video on the advertising side is growing extremely fast as well. In a way, it talks to the diversity of what you can do. Brands aren't limited to text or one single photo.\n\nFrom a consumption [perspective], members really engage with video, and love the format, and find it really appealing. The engagement there has far exceeded our expectations.\n\nIt's still early days for us with video, but it's a very strong start.\n\nJohnson: How are you seeing brands using LinkedIn?\n\nCohen: We have north of 30 million pages on LinkedIn today. This is businesses, enterprises, small businesses, schools, nonprofits, universities, and so on.\n\nWe completely redesigned the experience from scratch, really focusing on that notion of what makes a business successful. It's coming as part of the momentum of our consumer ecosystem. Our members are coming to LinkedIn more frequently right now and are looking to engage with businesses on LinkedIn.\n\nBusinesses want to connect with those communities \u2014 whether it's for hiring purposes, for selling purposes, for partnering purposes, [or] to excite their own employee base.\n\nWe've been working on this for several quarters, and it sparked a whole new thread for us, which is reinvesting in this experience and building it to where the future is.\n\nJohnson: What consumer-facing brands do you see beefing up their presence on LinkedIn?\n\nCohen: If you look at, for example, Airbnb. They make their people [an] announcement and introducing their new CTO to their employees. You can see colleagues and employees congratulating him on LinkedIn.\n\nThat happens a lot on LinkedIn. Everything from Walmart announcing new offices in Austin\u2014 members are asking for opportunities to work at Walmart \u2014 to nonprofits and all the way to Gates Foundation.\n\nWhen brands do it, you're basically seeing the convergence of corporate brand and talent brand coming together. The focus is that there's one brand. My brand could be talking to my customers, but the same post could be appealing to my employees and it could be appealing to talent in the future.\n\nThe companies that do this well are able to propel those communities and be very effective for them. You can get reach data and the LinkedIn graph to show who you're reaching and the impact that you're seeing there as well.\n\nLet's say you're able to find out that you're engaging a certain segment \u2014 like Walmart wanting to open an office in Austin, and they want to hire people there. They can go and use our tools to see what do folks in Austin care about and then share to those specific segments what they care about most.\n\nJohnson: How is that different from how brands think about communities on Facebook and Twitter?\n\nCohen: It's always about the professional mindset and making people more productive and successful professionally. If we take the example of Tesla and sharing their innovation, you're trying to spark a notion of great topics around innovation. At the same time, you have employees saying, \"I'm proud to work at Tesla. Look at what my company is building,\" that they share with their own network.\n\nPeople ultimately want to want to buy from companies who have great culture, great products, and they feel that they're connected to their value system.\n\nBy being able to share it on LinkedIn, you're able to reach all of those communities and know who they are because you have professional identities, and you're able to measure your reach so that you can better cater your messaging and creative going forward.", "Florida now has simultaneous recounts for both its gubernatorial and US Senate elections. America is unanimous on one thing: Florida botched it again.\n\nWhy is Florida such a perennial nightmare when it comes to election administration? There are three reasons.\n\nFlorida, like most of the US, doesn't invest enough in its elections\n\nIn 1999, the Broward County Supervisor of Elections had the equivalent of 60 full-time employees, a number that rose to 80 by 2006. That hiring spree coincided with the aftermath of the 2000 election, which cemented Florida's place in the annals of electoral cautionary tales. But the staff fell back down to 72 employees by 2017.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2017, Florida introduced early voting, and the population of Broward itself rose 20% from 1.6 million residents to 1.9 million.\n\nBut when you adjust for inflation, the $18.2 million spent by the Broward County Supervisor of Elections in 2017 is lower than the inflation-adjusted $19.2 million spent in 2005. That holds statewide: Setting aside the erratic spending on public campaign finance and constitutional amendments, the $3.2 million spent on elections by the state in the 2017-18 fiscal year is lower than the inflation-adjusted $3.9 million spent in the 2009-10 year.\n\nState governments are trying to keep lean, but the demands on local election officials \u2014 new technology, higher populations, more early voting, and meddling by foreign adversaries \u2014 aren't getting easier. And eventually, states get exactly what they pay for.\n\nThe federal government is dispersing $380 million to states and territories to bolster cybersecurity, but in Florida their funding only first showed up in July. Broward County received $1.16 million of the $14.6 million Florida has allocated.\n\nFlorida's county supervisors of elections are elected politicians, not civil servants\n\nIn Florida, there is no guarantee that the people who run elections at the county level are going to excel at the job. This is because while most states either appoint civil servants or have groups of people overseeing local elections, Florida's laws more closely resemble the preferred electoral policies of the \"Wild West.\"\n\nIn the United States, the actual management of elections is typically handled at the county and local level. In 10 states, those are managed by a Board of Elections. In 18 states, those duties are balanced between two or more offices \u2014 perhaps one running the day-to-day voter-registration requirements, while the other specializes in the day-of implementation of an election.\n\nIn 22 states, the responsibility and power of managing a local election rests on a single official. Florida is one of these states. Here is a map compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures:\n\nHow different states select their local election administrator. NCSL\n\nThere's another wrinkle:\n\nIn eight of those 22 states, the local election supervisors are civil servants appointed to run elections.\n\nIn 16 states, they're simply elected. Florida is one of those.\n\nSome states realize that larger municipalities need more reliable management \u2014 Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin have appointees manage elections in the largest, most-populous counties.\n\nIn Florida, only Miami-Dade County has an appointed official. (Miami-Dade is the county that counted its votes in a timely fashion and is surrounded by counties that did not.)\n\nWhen it comes to having elected, unchecked, and unassisted administrators, Florida stands with Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. This brings us to the third reason.\n\nFlorida has several counties larger than entire states\n\nNone of those other states have been deciding presidential races lately.\n\nMiami-Dade County alone is larger than each of those states, with the exception of Utah. Broward alone has about the population of Idaho, and Palm Beach has more people than Montana.\n\nPut together, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties would be the 21st-largest state in the country. When dealing with populations of that magnitude, and with Florida's consistent position as a consequential, if not absolutely essential, swing state, you're going to have tight races.\n\nWhat's more: While 42 states acknowledge or require some federally recommended voting-system standards, Florida is one of the eight states that do not. In Florida, training for local election officials is voluntary, with the only incentive to train being a pay bump.\n\nAs a result, Florida has a perfect storm of electoral mayhem:\n\nIt's always important.\n\nIt's usually very close in statewide races.\n\nAnd it has several counties the size of states.\n\nWhile other large and consequential states have election boards, appointed civil servants or multiple offices with defined responsibilities, Florida pretty much wings it.\n\nThe people overseeing those county-level elections are themselves elected and are not required to be good at their job by the state of Florida.\n\nAnd even if they were all stellar luminaries of electoral administration, the budgets and personnel levels they have to work with are stuck in the 20th century just as the challenges they have to deal with are getting smarter and more well-funded.\n\nIt's somewhat surprising it doesn't end in multiple simultaneous recounts more often.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Still, the figures show less than half of eligible voters (49.2%) participated in the election.\n\nMoreover, other developed countries put the US to shame when it comes to voter turnout in national elections, according to Mehlman's figures. In France's national election last year, for example, 67.9% of the voting-age population participated. South Korea's national election in 2017 saw an even higher number: 77.9%.\n\nAdditionally, Sweden, Israel, New Zealand, Germany, the UK, Canada, and Spain all had over half the voting-age population participate in their most recent national elections.\n\nWhile the US is technically the world's oldest democracy, it has an abysmal record when it comes to voter participation.\n\nRead more: 12 records the 2018 midterm elections smashed\n\nStill, 2018 represents a major improvement for the US in terms of midterm participation.

Welcome to the Refuge Program! Come on!Garrard Conley: I'm Garrard Conley. I'm the author of \"Boy Erased,\" now a major motion picture. \"Boy Erased\" is the story of my going into conversion therapy after being outed to my parents and the psychological torture that I endured while I was there. Victor Sykes in \"Boy Erased\": You cannot be born gay!Garrard: Also, it's the story, I think, of my mom who takes me out of therapy and saves my life, and also has to go on her own journey of acceptance.Martha Conley: I'm just here to try to stop conversion therapy because I wish I had done my homework before I took him instead of after I took him because it's a horrible thing and we need to get it stopped.Garrard: Conversion therapy's taken many forms. It's been around since the 19th century, actually. In the 1950's and '60s, there was a hospital called St. Elizabeths Hospital outside of Washington, D.C. They performed lobotomies, they performed electroshock therapy, they had people in straitjackets. At this moment, 36 states do not have bans on conversion therapy for minors. The bigger battle, however, is that any religious organization can perform conversion therapy and charge for it currently, no matter what state you're in. I mean, I had it pretty easy growing up. We moved to a place called Cherokee Village, Arkansas. We'd always been very much a church family. I'd always been told that being LGBTQ was not right and I don't think there were any exceptions to that. I think that, as I grew older, and I started to understand myself a lot more and my sexuality, it became obvious that I was on a crash course with these two ideologies.Martha: Being married to a Baptist pastor and being raised the way I was, we believed exactly what the Bible said about homosexuality, and that's what I was taught and I just didn't question it because I think you don't tend to question things until it hits your family or someone that you love.Garrard: I was actually in my first semester of college. Someone that I knew at the time raped me and he confessed to me that he'd also raped a 14-year-old boy. Right after he raped me, he confessed this to me. And I told some friends what he'd done and he found out that I'd told that. And so, as a preemptive move, he called my parents, called my mom specifically, because he really wanted to strike fear and it worked. And when I came home, Dad took me into his bedroom and said, like, \"Can you explain to me what's going on?\" And so I told him, \"I think I'm gay.\"Martha: First of all, we took him to the doctor and had his hormones checked, you know? That's how naive we were. Then we called the largest Southern Baptist church in Memphis and they said, \"Oh yes, you're so lucky.\" \"We have a unit right here in Memphis and it's called\" \"Love in Action, and they have an 84% cure rate.\" And I'm thinking, wow, you know? I didn't even know what conversion therapy was.Garrard: We did one-on-one therapy sessions after I was outed for about six months. I went to a residential program. The main activity that we did was called a \"Moral Inventory,\" and we were asked to write down every sexual fantasy or experience we'd ever had, and we would have to say it in front of everyone, like share that with everyone in the group. And then after that, they would give me Bible verses to sort of combat those thoughts that I'd had. I knew that if I didn't do this, I would lose my family, my faith, perhaps, my community. By the end of the second week, I was asked to do this exercise asking me to imagine my father sitting there, and basically say that I hated him. And I remember thinking to myself, these are Christians who are saying that in order to be cured, I have to hate someone not love someone. And Christ is all about love.Graham Flanagan: How much were you paying for this?Martha: It was like $3,200.Garrard: For just a really short period of time.Martha: And then we also had to stay in a hotel for two weeks.Garrard: But his quote for you, for me going out for a year, for doing years of therapy, how much was that?Martha: Well, it was like $21,000.Victor Sykes in \"Boy Erased\": Now this may be the toughest, but most rewarding 12 days that many of you will ever face.Martha: We later found out that all the leaders, I mean none of them had more than a high school education. Within a week, they started talking to me about, \"Oh he's not following the rules. He's not doing his homework right. I think you need to put him in the three-month program and then you need to think about keeping him out of school next year.\" That was just too quick. It just got so phony to me. And they were, like, trying to pressure me into signing him up, and he hadn't even been there a week yet.Victor Sykes in \"Boy Erased\": So, who's ready?Garrard: Victor Sykes in the film is based off of John Smid, who ran Love in Action for many years.Martha: 22.Garrard: 22 years. And after a while, I don't know if it's because of the negative press, or if it's because it got to his conscience, but he quit. He stepped down. And once he stepped down, he began a slow journey of realizing that it was not ever working, that he was selling a lie. And then, he married his now-husband, and lives in Paris, Texas making furniture. [Smid has since become an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights.]Martha: It just did such damage to me as well, because of the guilt I feel for taking him there. You do it because you think you're saving your child, and you love your child. I don't want other parents to have to go through the guilt that I've had to go through for 14 years.Garrard: I think the greatest value for this film is its ability to show a roadmap for people who are around LGBTQ youth to do better, and to act better, and to become better people through it. And that's what I hope the movie does.", "Since the release of \"Pok\u00e9mon: Red and Blue\" on the Game Boy in 1996, the Pok\u00e9mon franchise has become iconic around the world, spawning countless spin-off games, an animated series and movies, a trading card craze, an on-stage musical, and most recently, a live action film.\n\nAnd as Pok\u00e9mon has gradually secured its place in our cultural memory, the video games have continued to add new layers to the franchise's rich world with generation after generation of new Pok\u00e9mon. In the 22 years since the series began, the original 151 monsters in \"Pok\u00e9mon: Red, Blue and Yellow\" have ballooned into a roster of more than 800 different species, with even more variations.\n\nIt's a lot to keep track of, even for those who have been fans of the series for years. The days of casually naming every Pok\u00e9mon are long gone.\n\nOn Friday, November 16th, Nintendo will take a step back to the basics with the release of \"Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go Eevee!\" The two games, which cost $60 (or $100 with a special controller), are the first games in the main Pok\u00e9mon series to be released for the Nintendo Switch console, and they represent an effort to recapture the magic that enraptured the franchise's first generation of fans.\n\nHere's what it's like to play the latest Pok\u00e9mon games:", "The 2018 midterm elections were one week ago, but tensions are heating up in several of the 10 House races that have yet to be called \u2014 including the contest for the open seat in California's 39th congressional district, which includes portions of Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino counties.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republican candidate Young Kim saw her lead over Democrat Gil Cisneros narrow to just 711 votes from 1, 957 on Monday as the mail-in ballots counted after Election Day have leaned heavily in Cisneros' favor. Kim, a former state assemblywoman aide to outgoing Rep. Ed Royce, led by nearly 4,000 votes when the polls closed on Nov. 6th.\n\nAfter initially accusing the Cisneros campaign of being \"rebuked\" by the Los Angeles Registrar and County Clerk's offices for alleged ballot tampering on Sunday, the Kim campaign took the allegations a step further after Cisneros gained more ground on Monday.\n\n\"The Gil Cisneros Campaign has been desperate to influence and alter the outcome of this race by harassing and intimidating vote counters in Orange County,\" the campaign said Monday. \"Those nefarious actions reflect a campaign...that will do anything in their desperate effort to change the results.\"\n\nThey also asserted that Kim's initial lead should be reflected in the results of the mail-in and provisional ballots, adding that \"anything falling significantly outside of those percentages could reflect foul play.\"\n\nAs the Los Angeles Times pointed out on Tuesday, however, the distribution of the vote count in the 39th district so far is par for the course in California elections.\n\nWhile older and more conservative-leaning voters make up most of those who vote early and on Election Day, younger and Democratic-leaning voters take advantage of California's policy to count all mailed-in ballots that are postmarked by Election Day, meaning Democratic candidates usually see their vote counts increase as those ballots are tabulated.\n\nIn a statement to INSIDER on Tuesday, the Cisneros campaign accused the Kim campaign of \"blatantly lying\" in their allegations of ballot tampering, and further alleged that a representative for the Kim campaign had, in fact, been asked to leave the premises of the LA County Registrar's Office for photographing and attempting to tamper with ballots.\n\nA spokesperson for LA County Registrar denied the Kim campaign's allegations of ballot interference and harassment of vote counters to INSIDER, also on Tuesday.\n\n\"We have not addressed anything related to ballot tampering or physical tampering with ballots,\" they said. \"Our process is transparent and secured.\"\n\nThe office declined to comment on the Cisneros campaigns' allegations and eyewitness reports that as many as three observers and supporters of the Young Kim campaign were escorted off the premises of the Registrar's Office.\n\nThe Kim campaign did not respond to INSIDER's requests for comment on the Registrar's statement or whether they planned to retract their allegations of vote tampering in light of the Registrar's denial of such activity.\n\nEquality California, a LGBTQ rights group supporting Cisneros, called the Kim campaign's allegations a \"desperate, dangerous stunt to save face as her lead continues to shrink\" in a Tuesday statement.\n\n\"Accusing your opponent of cheating just because you don't like the outcome may be the norm in Florida these days, but it won't fly in California,\" the group added.\n\nAccusations of voter fraud and disagreements over procedures for counting overseas and provisional ballots have been an issue in a number of 2018 midterm races, including the recounts of the gubernatorial and Senate races in Florida.\n\nRead more:Hotly contested r recounts are underway in Florida, as Georgia and Arizona scramble to finalize results in key races\n\nIn a Tuesday ruling, a judge in Florida found no evidence for claims of election fraud and illegal practices by local election authorities lodged by Republican Senate candidate Gov.

The Food and Drug Administration has called it a dangerous opioid and sought to ban it by making it a Schedule 1 drug like heroin or ecstasy. Some advocates say it's helped them end their addiction to opioids, and scientists want to keep exploring its potential as a medical treatment.\n\nRight now, researchers at the DEA are evaluating the two main components in kratom. They'll either rule the same for both ingredients, effectively banning all forms of kratom nationwide, or they'll ban one and make the other potentially available as a medicine at a later date. That's according to Melvin Patterson, a spokesperson with the Drug Enforcement Administration who described the ruling as forthcoming.\n\n\"I think there's just a few remaining in-house things the DEA was looking at\" before issuing a ruling, Patterson told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nRight now, kratom is legal in most states, where it is sold in whole plant form as a supplement.\n\nThe ruling is highly anticipated by both advocates who say the drug has saved their lives and by scientists who simply want to learn more about how it works.\n\n\"I wish there was some sort of holding box we could put drugs like this in until more studies could be done,\" Scott Hemby, a professor of pharmaceutical science at North Carolina's High Point University who authored a recent study isolating kratom's two main ingredients, told Business Insider on Monday. Hemby also said that based on his recent discussions with regulatory officials, he believed a decision on kratom was \"imminent.\"Read more: A mysterious supplement has a viral following of people who take it for addiction \u2014 and researchers say it's too compelling to ignore\n\nHemby's research \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 was a preliminary study looking at how kratom's two main components affect behavior in rats. His findings suggested that the chief compound in the plant could potentially offer therapeutic benefits to people dealing with addiction, but it's still early days for the work.\n\n\"We're at the precipice of something promising here,\" Hemby said when the paper came out.\n\nBut Hemby worries that the government's ruling could make studying the plant and its key ingredients even harder than it already is, and he's not alone.\n\nLife-saving supplement or dangerous opioid?\n\nKratom pills. Psychonaught/Wikimedia Commons Frequently ground into a fine powder and taken as pills or tea, kratom is a psychoactive drug derived from the leaves of an Asian plant in the coffee family called Mitragyna speciosa. Kratom advocates swear by the stuff, saying it's helped them kick devastating addictions to opioid painkillers.\n\nBut federal regulatory bodies like the FDA and the DEA have cracked down on kratom and previously tried to ban it.\n\n\"It's like a cruel joke that I finally found something that works, and the FDA and DEA want it banned,\" Bryce Avey, a 26-year-old California native told Business Insider this summer. Avey said he took kratom daily as a tea to help him stop using the opioids he became addicted to after wrist surgery.\n\nThe efforts to make kratom illegal culminated at two recent points: In 2016, the DEA attempted to ban kratom but stopped after facing backlash from advocates and members of Congress. Then in October 2017, the FDA broke out kratom's two main components and studied them separately, ultimately recommending a ban on both of them, Stat News reported this month.\n\nThat 2017 FDA recommendation was then sent to the DEA, which began the lengthy process of reevaluating the drug's two components to make a final decision on the legality of each of them, Patterson said.\n\nNow, a decision on the drug's two compounds is imminent, he said. While the FDA focuses on medicinal potential, the DEA looks at the compounds' abuse potential.\n\nImportantly, the agency could choose to rule differently on each compound, Patterson added. Those include mitragynine (MG) and 7\u2010hydroxymitragynine (7\u2010HMG) \u2014 two ingredients that Hemby calls \"the yin and yang of kratom\" because while HMG could be potentially harmful, MG seems like it has a lot of therapeutic potential.\n\nThat means that even if HMG gets banned or placed into Schedule 1, there's a possibility that MG could be placed in a different schedule. (Popular ADHD drug Adderall, for example, is a Schedule 2 drug.)\n\n'The yin and yang of kratom'\n\nIn stark contrast to what regulators have said about kratom, a growing cluster of physicians and researchers are beginning to suggest that the drug could have therapeutic potential. Some have said they understand why people looking to get off opioids might find the drug helpful; others have said that new research suggests the plant's compounds could have untapped potential.\n\n\"It makes sense that this product would mitigate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal or allow someone to transition from a higher dose to lower dose, or help get off them off of opioids altogether,\" David Juurlink, a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto, told Business Insider this summer.\n\nOne big reason is that the kratom plant's two main ingredients \u2014 which can be thought of as similar to how marijuana contains both THC and CBD \u2014 appear to have very different effects on the brain.\n\nOf kratom's two chief ingredients (MG and HMG), MG is thought to be the compound with the most therapeutic potential. There's about 30 times more MG in Kratom than there is HMG.\n\nHemby's study was the first to use rats to investigate how each of these two compounds affects the brain. After giving the animals the chance to self-administer each ingredient by pushing a dial, they found that the rats quickly took advantage of the opportunity to give themselves the HMG but were completely uninterested in MG.\n\n\"We stood on our heads to get them to self-administer,\" Hemby said, adding that his team tried upping the doses of MG several times. \"It just wasn't working. It was almost like it was innocuous.\"\n\nIn other words, while one of kratom's main compounds appeared to be addictive, the other wasn't at all \u2014 in fact, it appeared to have the opposite effect.\n\nThat could be promising for people who are turning to kratom for relief from opioid addiction. The drug is known to tap into some of the same brain receptors as opioids \u2014 which spurred the FDA to officially call it an opioid in February.\n\nBut some people believe those characteristics mean kratom could help treat opioid addiction by staunching cravings and reducing withdrawal and relapse.\n\nHemby's findings also suggest there might be a way to process kratom to capitalize on this therapeutic potential by heightening the effects of one compound while minimizing the effects of the other. Strains of the plant, for example, can be bred to have differing concentrations of MG and HMG.\n\nThat's something that he and other researchers like him want to keep studying, he said, so long as government regulators let them.\n\n\"It's really a rush to judgement to say let's put the kibosh on everything,\" Hemby said.", "My wife and I have a five-year-old son and a seven-month-old daughter. We ask our kids a lot of questions, and many of them are the same day after day. While Scarlett can't do much answering yet, her older brother Ben sure can.\n\nAmong my favorite questions to ask my son is, \"What did you have for lunch?,\" because his school's chef prepares meals that sound fit for a Michelin-star restaurant, while my wife always asks about specific projects he worked on. We ask who he played with at recess, what songs the kids sang at music class, or what games they played at gym, and so on.\n\nMost of the family dinner table talk revolves around Ben's day at school, because that's usually more interesting than the stuff adults do. (\"And then, I did more research before I started writing an article!\") But the primary thing we ask our kid at the dinner table every day doesn't necessarily have to do with school, and in fact is often the most telling on weekends, during travel, or over summer break. That question is:\n\n\"What was the best part of your day?\"\n\nI always ask this question, partially because I love knowing all about my son's life and being as much a part of it as I can, even though he's now gone for most of his waking hours at school from 8:30 to 3.\n\nAsking him what his favorite moment from a day was tells me much about what he most values at each stage in life. Sometimes it's playing with a certain classmate for several days in a row, which tips us off to schedule play dates out of school. Sometimes it's learning about a given topic, which can help us think of what books, games, and other activities to have on hand.\n\nWe don't ask what our child's best part of the day was only so we can learn about it, but also so that he can learn about it. Asking open-ended questions like this elicits reflection and introspection. When Ben thinks back on his day, at times he has a ready answer, but sometimes it takes him a while to think through the events and experiences of the preceding hours before he can pick out that highlight.\n\nAsking a child about a highlight from their day can also help put those not-so-great days in perspective. On days where my five-year-old is in a bad mood, is feeling tired or restless, or when he simply didn't have a good day, having him isolate at least one positive can elevate his mood, making him realize it's never all bad. (Or at least that it's rarely all bad, but hopefully he won't think like that for years or even decades to come, if ever.)\n\nRead more: I asked my 5-year-old son what it means to be happy, and his answer was surprisingly profound\n\nThe other reason open-ended, personal questions like this are great for a kid of any age as well as for an adult? There's no wrong answer.\n\nWhile I do care what my son most enjoyed from his day, and I encourage him to reflect and intuit from his pondering, more than anything, my wife and I know that communication is critical for raising kids that feel loved, valued, and engaged in the family and beyond. Until the kids are old enough to talk about the news, we're talking about our days.\n\nAnd as hackneyed as this might sound, it's the truth: Usually, the highlight of our day is hearing all about his. The news is pretty rough stuff these days anyway.", "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 two longtime political foes despite their shared party affiliation \u2014 celebrated their deal with Amazon to bring the retail giant's secondary headquarters, known as HQ2, to Long Island City, Queens.\n\nBoth men praised the \"unprecedented\" scale and impact of the project, which will create at least 25,000 jobs over the next 10 years in the already fast-growing waterfront neighborhood just across the East River from Manhattan, during a Tuesday afternoon joint press conference.\n\nCuomo said the project will have a 9:1 revenue-to-incentive ratio \u2014 \"the highest rate of return for an economic incentive program the state has ever offered\" \u2014 resulting in $13.5 billion in tax revenue over the next 25 years. He and the mayor noted that the largest economic development project before HQ2 created 1,500 jobs in the state.\n\n\"This blows away anything we've ever seen,\" de Blasio said.\n\nAmazon says it will invest about $2.5 billion in its campus and related projects, including infrastructure, a school, and green space development.\n\nAt the same time, the state will likely provide $2 billion \u2014 if not significantly more \u2014 in tax incentives to the company, a major point of contention among critics of the plan. Both de Blasio and Cuomo called the competition for HQ2 a long and \"fierce\" process and said the massive tax incentives were necessary in order to seal the deal.\n\nRead more: 'We were not elected to serve as Amazon drones': Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other NYC politicians voice outrage about Amazon HQ2's move to Long Island City\n\nBut the mayor has previously insisted that he doesn't support corporate subsidies as a method of attracting big business to the city.\n\n\"We do not believe in subsidies to corporations for retention or to attract corporations,\" de Blasio said last week. \"That's a very strong view that I hold, and it's the difference from the Bloomberg administration that did believe in those kind of corporate subsidies.\"\n\nCuomo insisted that New York had to fight for the project in order to remain economically competitive.\n\n\"You want to be ahead of the economic curve,\" the governor said. \"Either you are a part of the economy of tomorrow or you are a part of the economy of yesterday.\"\n\nThe headquarters, which will eventually grow into an eight million square foot campus on Long Island City's waterfront, will be built in close proximity to the country's largest public housing development, Queensbridge Houses. The mayor said Amazon will work with the New York City Housing Authority to provide job and training opportunities to Queensbridge residents.\n\n\"One of the biggest companies on earth next to the biggest public housing development in the United States \u2014 the synergy is going to be extraordinary,\" de Blasio said, calling Tuesday \"a great day for New York City\" and \"an extraordinary day for Queens.\"\n\nREUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\n\n'Would we be happier if they weren't coming?'\n\nBut not all Democratic leadership in the city and state are praising the announcement. Many doubt that the benefits of the project will be felt by the city's struggling communities.\n\nProgressive city leaders including Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and members of the New York City Council have expressed concern\u2014 and in some cases outrage \u2014 over both the process through which the deal was made. They were especially critical of the tax incentives, as well as the potential negative impacts of moving the e-commerce giant into a city whose infrastructure and education systems are already strained.\n\n\"The idea that [Amazon] will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Monday.\n\nLocal politicians voiced concern about the headquarters' future impact on rent costs and property values, which will likely skyrocket in the neighborhood and surrounding areas, and also the burden it will place on the city's infrastructure, including the struggling subway.\n\nDe Blasio acknowledged that some concern about the massive project is fair, and said that he's working to maximize benefit for \"everyday New Yorkers,\" which he insisted will far outweigh the costs of the project.\n\n\"I ask a real blunt question: Would we be happier if they weren't coming?\" de Blasio said. \"I think most people look at the numbers and they're gonna say, 'No, how on earth are we gonna lose all those jobs and tax revenue.'\"", "Amazon has finally settled on a home for its second headquarters, dubbed HQ2.\n\nThe new offices will be split between two locations: Long Island City in Queens, New York, and an area of Northern Virginia that is now being called National Landing. National Landing consists of what a website for Virginia's HQ2 bid calls three \"connected urban districts\": Crystal City and Pentagon City in Arlington and Potomac Yard in Alexandria.\n\nWhile the news was officially announced on Tuesday morning, it didn't come as a surprise to many people after reports surfaced last week that Amazon would likely be picking these two locations.\n\nIn fact, people were so convinced that this would happen that they began snapping up real estate in this area before the official announcement was even made.\n\nLong Island City real estate brokers told The Wall Street Journal that they had witnessed a flurry of inquiries over the past week. Some of these people were even buying units, sight-unseen, via text message, The Journal wrote on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"This is the first time in my 20-year career that I have seen the market go from a buyer's market to a seller's market overnight, based on a rumor,\" Patrick W. Smith, a Stribling agent in Long Island City, told The Journal.\n\nAccording to The Journal, searches on the real-estate listing site StreetEasy surged 295% for the neighborhood last week versus the week before. The biggest spike occurred in the first few days after news broke that Amazon could be opening an office in Long Island City. Search volume jumped more than 400% at that time, according to StreetEasy.\n\n\"Buyers are hoping it will become the next Silicon Valley and want to be in on that,\" Kayla Lee, a broker at Modern Spaces, told The Journal.\n\nBut while many are hoping to capitalize on an upcoming real-estate boom, some locals are worried about the potential downsides that this will have on rental prices, gentrification, and traffic.\n\nRead more: The losers of Amazon's HQ2 contest have been revealed \u2014 but some locals are rejoicing\n\nThese people have most likely taken note of the impact many say Amazon's main headquarters has had on Seattle, where locals complain of skyrocketing rents, prolonged construction, gentrification, and gridlock traffic.\n\nBusiness Insider reported earlier this year that Seattle's median rent increased by nearly three times the national median from 2005 to 2015.\n\nRead more about Amazon's HQ2 project:", "Heading into a high-stakes bilateral discussion between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the US administration is missing a concrete, unified strategy to try to end the trade war while also extracting concessions from the Chinese.\n\nTrump and Xi are set to meet in two weeks at the G20 summit in Argentina to try and strike a deal to lower tariffs on roughly $360 billion worth of goods flowing between the two countries. But two of Trump's top trade advisers appear to be in different frames of mind about a potential deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, criticized Peter Navarro, Trump's ultra-protectionist trade adviser, during an appearance on CNBC. Kudlow took issue with Navarro's comments that slammed Wall Street's alleged involvement in US-China trade talks.\n\n\"If and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald Trump's terms \u2014 not Wall Street's,\" Navarro said. \"If Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into these negotiations there will be a stench around any deal that is consummated.\"\n\nRead more: Now it's full steam ahead for Trump's trade war with China\n\nAsked about the comments, Kudlow offered a dismissal of his coworker's words.\n\n\"Look, Peter Navarro is a friend of mine, truly. We've known each other for 20 years, but he was not speaking for the president, nor was he speaking for the administration,\" Kudlow said. \"His remarks were way off base. They were not authorized by anybody. I actually think he did the president a great disservice.\"\n\nKudlow, a former CNBC host and Wall Street economist, said Navarro was wrong because Trump has been speaking to many interested parties \u2014 including Wall Street banks \u2014 to solicit input on the trade war with China.\n\n\"So I think Peter very badly misspoke,\" Kudlow said. \"He was freelancing, and he's not representing the president or the administration.\"\n\nRead more: Trump is once again moving closer to imposing auto tariffs, a move that could have massive economic consequences\n\nKudlow's dismissal of Navarro's comments underlines the central tension between two sides of Trump's economic team:\n\nOn the one side is Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who have been cheerleaders for free trade and argued that Trump's trade war with China is designed to ultimately facilitate more free trade around the world.\n\nOn the other side is Navarro, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and \u2014 to an extent \u2014 Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who all believe the administration needs to take a hard line with China. This side also has a key advantage: Trump has been a public advocate of tariffs and trade restrictions for decades.\n\nThe two sides squared off during the last high-stakes negotiations between China and the US in May. During those meetings in Beijing, Navarro and Mnuchin reportedly engaged in a shouting match that was overheard by Chinese officials. The rift apparently left Chinese negotiators confused and helped contribute to the failure to reach a deal.\n\nLower-level talks between China and the US have restarted, and Kudlow told CNBC that Trump and Xi recently spoke. But the G20 summit is the first face-to-face trade discussion between the two leaders since the trade war started in earnest. While analysts aren't particularly hopeful that the two sides can come to an agreement during the meeting in Argentina, the cracks in Trump's trade team could once again make any progress even more difficult.\n\nIn addition to the looming China talks, the two sides are also reportedly bickering over Trump's desire to impose tariffs on imported cars and trucks. Navarro is reportedly encouraging Trump to move forward with the crackdown, but Mnuchin and Kudlow warn that the move would have devastating economic consequences.\n\nA decision on that issue appears to be close, as Trump convened a meeting of his trade team to discuss the auto tariffs on Tuesday.", "Several people were arrested during protests inside Georgia's state capitol on Tuesday, the last day of ballot counting in Georgia's tight and contentious gubernatorial race.\n\nState Senator Nikema Williams was arrested after she refused to leave the floor of the capital, despite the fact that she said she was not actively protesting.\n\n\"I'm being arrested because I refused to leave the floor of a body I serve in. I'm a state senator. I was not yelling. I was not chanting. I stood peacefully next to my constituents because they wanted their voices to be heard, and now I'm being arrested,\" Williams told reporters.\n\nThe arrests sparked immediate outrage from the left online.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Abrams is trailing Kemp, who has 50.3% of the vote, by about 58,000 votes \u2014 or 1.5 percentage points.\n\nBallots continue to be counted in the state, and a runoff would be triggered if neither candidate earns 50% of the vote in the final count. While Kemp has called Abrams' refusal to concede \"a disgrace to democracy,\" thousands of provisional ballots have been counted since election day \u2014 including at polling sites that initially said they had completed their counts.\n\nDespite the ongoing count \u2014 which will end on Tuesday, both Kemp and Trump have declared Republican victory in the race.\n\nRead more: Hotly contested recounts are underway in Florida, as Georgia and Arizona scramble to finalize results in key races\n\nA federal judge Monday night ordered all of the state's provisional ballots to be counted and prevented the state from certifying the election before a Friday deadline. Still, Abrams would need over 20,000 more votes to trigger a runoff, which would be held on December 4, and it's unclear whether there are enough uncounted votes to narrow the gap between Abrams and Kemp.\n\n\"We will continue to fight for each and every eligible vote to be counted because in a democracy, every vote should be valued. Georgians deserve nothing less,\" Abrams' campaign manager told NBC News on Saturday.\n\nFurther intensifying the contentious battle are charges that the state has engaged in widespread voter suppression. As Georgia's secretary of state, Kemp purged an unprecedented 1.5 million inactive voters from the rolls and classified over 50,000 voters \u2014 the vast majority of whom are black \u2014 as \"pending\" because their information did not precisely reflect data in government records.", "After a two-year investigation from the Department of Justice into the production processes of advertising agencies, five of the world's biggest holding companies have reportedly been cleared.\n\nFederal prosecutors were specifically looking into \"non-transparent\" practices like receiving rebates from media outlets.

That is, until Friday.\n\nWithin about 24 hours after the Camp Fire broke out, practically all of Paradise had burned to the ground, along with much of a nearby town called Magalia.\n\nBelow are two satellite views of Paradise and Magalia, where about 11,000 people were living. The towns are located about 100 miles north of Sacramento (California's capital city). The northern flank of Paradise is shown on the bottom-left of each picture, and Magalia at the center.\n\nThe first image, in which everything appears normal, was taken by the commercial satellite imaging company DigitalGlobe on September 10.

(Click and drag the slide bar up and down to compare the two photos.)\n\n\"We started with nothing once, and we can do it again,\" Paradise resident Eleanor Southwick, 78, told INSIDER's Kelly McLaughlin on Friday. \"We still have our family and friends and that's the thing that's important.\"\n\nSome who lived in the area hope to return and rebuild, but other families have not been so lucky.\n\nSo far the wildfire has killed at least 42 people, some of them inside or near cars as they tried to flee.\n\nThe Camp Fire left behind burned cars on the side of a road in Paradise, California.

Bill Nelson, the Democrat at risk of being unseated by the Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott, Schumer tore into the president for asserting that Nelson should have already conceded the election.\n\n\"If he really wants an honest and fair election, President Trump will stop bullying, harassing, and lying about the vote in Florida and let the election proceed without the heavy hand of the president tipping the scales of justice,\" Schumer told reporters.\n\nSchumer, who declined to take questions from reporters in the Capitol, also called for extending the Sunday deadline put in place to finish the recount if need be.\n\n\"Right now the state of Florida has a Sunday deadline for the hand recount. This rule stems from the 2000 Bush v. Gore recount and was put in place because the recount in 2000 was in danger of taking so long that the Electoral College would meet without knowing Florida's results,\" he said. \"Fortunately with the Senate race, there is no Electoral College. That means supervisors of the elections should have all the time they need to count every Floridian's ballot to make sure the candidate with the most votes is actually seated in January, even if the vote count has to go beyond Sunday.\"\n\nTrump has been vocal about the race, even calling for Nelson to drop out before the recount has been concluded.", "When Radiohead famously released its \"In Rainbows\" album in 2007 and told fans to \"pay what you want,\" Jonathan Swerdlin forked over $50.\n\nHe was enamored by the radically different approach to payments. But to his disappointment, the model that helped Radiohead instantaneously earn $3 million upon the album's release never really caught on in the music business.\n\nSwerdlin \u2014 who started his career in e-commerce, most recently helping grow a popular online women's underwear company called THINX\u2014 couldn't shake his fascination with Radiohead's experiment or ignore the rise of micropayments on gaming platforms. He also took note of countries like China, where \"tipping\" for content from one's favorite blogger, live-streamer or musician has become the norm.\n\nOn Tuesday, Swerdlin announced the launch of Portal, an ad-free video-streaming platform where creators are paid directly by viewers who like what they watch.\n\nFor his ad-free video platform, which puts him in direct competition with the likes of YouTube and Vimeo, Swerdlin, Portal's co-founder and CEO, has raised $4.2 million in seed funding from investors, including Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who is also famous for being an investor on the show \"Shark Tank.\"\n\n\"For the content creator, [Portal] gives them the ability to focus on value and investing in delivering something that matters to people rather than trying to churn something out every single day and game an algorithm,\" Swerdlin told Business Insider in a recent interview.\n\nGetting paid with Portal\n\nPortal's key difference from other video platforms, Swerdlin told Business Insider in a recent interview, is how creators are paid.\n\nSimilar to Radiohead's \"pay what you want\" approach, Portal lets viewers \"tip\" creators for the videos they watch. Enjoy the content you consume, and you can leave a tip ranging from $0.10 all the way up to $100.\n\nFor multiple revenue streams, any creator on Portal can also set up monthly subscriptions for their channels or enable a paywall for the individual videos they post. To make money on its end, Portal will eventually take a small percentage of the funds paid to creators.\n\nSwerdlin and his team \u2014 which currently comprises five engineers and \"a small community team\" \u2014 hope the shift away from an ad-based model (which compensates creators according to the sheer number of views a video receives) will increase the quality of content being produced.\n\nPortal\n\nAd-free means freedom to create\n\nAnother major upside to an ad-free model, Swerdlin explained, is that content creators don't have to feel the need to create \"advertiser-friendly\" content designed not to offend deep-pocketed media buyers.\n\n\"[Advertisers] should not be the authority on what it is that we see or don't see,\" Swerdlin explained. \"That's not what the internet was built for. That's a fail right there. But [advertising is] a multi-billion dollar business and because of that, it continues on.\"\n\nSwerdlin also decried the practice of \"demonetization,\" where platforms like YouTube decide that some videos or channels are unsuitable for advertisers and revoke their share of the ad revenue from that content.\n\nWhile the idea is to tamp down on offensive videos \u2014 infamous conspiracy theorist channel Infowars was recently demonetized by YouTube \u2014 others have gotten caught in the crossfire. LGBTQIA video creators, in particular, have complained that they have been unfairly targeted by YouTube for demonetization. He said Portal has already attracted a thriving community of LGBTQIA creators who felt jilted by its larger rivals.\n\n\"Demonetization is censorship,\" Swerdlin said. \"When you take away [people's] ability to earn money then you take away their ability to create content. It takes money and time and investment. You have to pay the bills.\"\n\nNotable creators that have been using Portal's beta product for the past few months are social media guru Gary Vaynerchuk and the online news show The Young Turks.\n\n\"The Young Turks has always believed in the 'audience first' approach to content creation and place great value on the direct relationship with our fans,\" The Young Turks' Chief Business Officer Steven Oh said in a statement. \"We are excited to be on Portal to continue building that direct-to-consumer relationship.\"\n\nA crazy idea takes shape\n\nFor Swerdlin, the launch of Portal has been two long years in the making.\n\n\"Everybody told me in the beginning that I was crazy. A lot of people didn't realize that ads were a problem,\" Swerdlin recalled. \"It's been really interesting and exciting for everybody to sober up and wake up to the problem.\"\n\nRead more: The CEO of Vimeo landed the job at 34 \u2014 and she learned a huge leadership lesson in her first 12 months at the top\n\nAs for the seemingly insurmountable battle of taking on a competitor like YouTube, which as of May had over 1.8 billion active users, Swerdlin said he's confident that Portal's micropayments model will ultimately win out.\n\n\"People think like, 'Oh, David and Goliath,' with platforms like Facebook and YouTube as the Goliath,\" Swerdlin said. \"But if you compare the models side-by-side and you look ten years from now, in ten years from now, our model will be the Goliath.\"\n\nWant to learn more about investments?

Writing on Twitter that he will soon \"expose the biggest political scandal in modern history,\" Papadopoulos is also actively considering withdrawing his guilty plea.\n\nIn their motion Tuesday, Papadopoulos' former defense lawyers, Thomas Breen and Robert Stanley of the law firm Breen & Pugh, said they were withdrawing \"because the criminal case has concluded, and the time for Mr. Papadopoulos to file an appeal has passed.\"\n\nBut Elie Honig, a former prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, told INSIDER that Papadopoulos' lawyers' reasoning is atypical.\n\n\"Normally, when a case is over, and a defendant is sentenced, the lawyers don't formally withdraw from representing that person,\" Honig said. \"The case just ends. The lawyer doesn't say, 'OK, I'm out.'\"\n\nHonig said it was more likely that Papadopoulos' \"lawyers are trying to disassociate with him because of the conspiracy theories he's spreading, or perhaps they told him to knock it off, and he's not listening.\"\n\nPapadopoulos tweeted in September that his meeting with Australian diplomat Alexander Downer \u2014 where he told Downer that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton's campaign in the form of \"thousands of emails,\" an encounter that kicked off the Russia probe \u2014 was a setup by British intelligence. Breen responded to his then client's tweet by telling The Washington Post, \"Most of our clients listen and follow all of our advice, some follow most of our advice, some follow some of our advice, some follow none of our advice.\"\n\nPapadopoulos' lawyers leaving his case \"could be due to the fact that Papadopoulos is now pursuing an odd strategy involving a conspiracy rather than a legal theory,\" Jeffrey Cramer, a former prosecutor who spent 12 years at the DOJ told INSIDER. \"I don't know if he is appealing his conviction on some grounds or merely keeping himself in the public domain to raise money.\"\n\n\"Regardless,\" Cramer added, \"he doesn't need a trial or appellate lawyer now. Tom Breen is a wonderful trial attorney and counsel. He isn't a publicist, however, which it seems is what Papadopoulos is looking for at this time.\"\n\nPapadopoulos' lawyers withdrew from representing him. Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nA 'self-defeating gambit'\n\nThe other possibility, Honig said, is that if Papadopoulos is seriously considering withdrawing his guilty plea, his lawyers would no longer be able to represent him because of a conflict of interest.\n\nIf Papadopoulos is gearing up to file a motion to withdraw his plea, he would have to show a judge that he was somehow misled or coerced into pleading guilty, and the plea was not fully voluntary.\n\nOn a practical level, that would set up a defendant to argue that his lawyers didn't explain the full terms of the plea correctly, that they lied to him, or that they otherwise coerced him into entering a guilty plea.\n\n\"If he does make that motion, Papadopoulos will end up adverse to his own lawyers,\" Honig said. \"And obviously they can't then represent him if they're also going to be witnesses.\"\n\nSuccessfully withdrawing a guilty plea is extraordinarily difficult, DOJ veterans told INSIDER. And if Papadopoulos does succeed, he may find himself in deeper trouble than he was before, because his indictment would resurface, and he would not have the option of pleading guilty with an agreement to cooperate.\n\nMueller's team indicated in the former Trump campaign aide's sentencing memo that in addition to lying during his initial FBI interview, Papadopoulos also lied while cooperating with prosecutors.\n\nThe special counsel's office added that Papadopoulos failed to provide \"substantial assistance\" to their investigators, which may have warranted leniency, and that he participated in a media interview last December without their knowledge. The interview, prosecutors said, prompted them to cancel a sitdown with him where he was set to answer more questions.\n\n\"There's no way Mueller would cooperate with him again if Papadopoulos withdrew his plea,\" Honig said. \"So his only options are to enter a guilty plea without a cooperation agreement, which would almost certainly require him to do more than 14 days. Or he can go all the way and go to trial, where he would be buried.\"\n\n\"So he's got nowhere to go here,\" Honig added. \"It's a self-defeating gambit.\"", "Tilray\n\nTilray posted its first earnings report as a publicly traded US company following Tuesday's closing bell.\n\nThe company missed on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe cannabis producer became the first pot company to have an initial public offering in the US in July.\n\nWatch Tilray trade live here.\n\nCannabis producer Tilray on Tuesday posted its first earnings report since going public in the US.

It takes a few seconds, and once confirmed, the passenger can head past the stop-point and go through the X-ray machine \u2014 there's no line, no fumbling with documents, and no wait.\n\nCLEAR applies whether or not you also have TSA PreCheck. If you do, you'll skip to the front of the PreCheck line and still not have to bother with your travel documents \u2014 as usual, with PreCheck, you can leave your shoes, belts, and light jackets on, and leave liquids and often laptops in your bag. If you don't have PreCheck, you'll skip to the front of the regular security line and go through the normal process from there.\n\nTSA PreCheck coupled with CLEAR means that in most cases, you can get through the airport security checkpoint in minutes, if not seconds, with virtually no hassle.\n\nThe process of applying for PreCheck is fairly easy, but involves an interview that may not be possible to complete before Thanksgiving travel \u2014 if you're interested in applying for PreCheck, take a look at this article on how to get a credit to cover the application fee from your credit card.\n\nCLEAR, on the other hand, is quick and easy to apply for, and you can complete the application and scan your biometrics at the airport on your way to a flight \u2014 that process can easily be quicker than the regular security line.\n\nWhile CLEAR isn't available at every airport and terminal yet, its availability is expanding rapidly at major airports \u2014 you can see a full list here.\n\nMost recently, CLEAR announced that it's arriving at JFK's busy Terminal 4 before Thanksgiving, making now an ideal time to apply if you expect to transit through New York with Delta, Virgin Atlantic, or any of a number of other major carriers.\n\nBest of all, Business Insider readers can get two free months of CLEAR \u2014 enough to cover the whole holiday period \u2014 when they apply and use promo code INSIDER.

Rowe Price's David Giroux said at a press event in New York on Tuesday.\n\nThat's up from 20% just two years ago and a leap from a decade ago when secular risk was \"rarely discussed,\" said Giroux, the chief investment officer of equity and multi-asset at the $1 trillion asset manager.\n\nOne challenge for investors will be to identify the next round of companies facing secular pressures before the market does. Giroux, who works in active investing, said secular risk would be a \"powerful challenge to passive investing over the next five to 10 years.\"\n\nPassive investors' capital sits in funds tied to indexes \u2014 such as the S&P 500 \u2014 that do not typically account for such industry headwinds. Meanwhile, active managers can identify stocks that will avoid secular risks.\n\nIndustries like traditional retail, malls, grocery stores, and cable providers have new competitive threats like Amazon and Netflix. Technological advances, including shale drilling and electric vehicles, affect the energy industry, while the move to the cloud hurts legacy technology and hardware companies.\n\nMeanwhile, consumers' changing habits, such as shifting shopping patterns and a move toward organic products, affect the packaged-food industry and consumer-goods companies.\n\nCompanies facing secular risk can suffer from a slower growth rate, margin compression, and multiple compression, Giroux said.\n\nIndustries that are not affected by \u2014 and can even benefit from \u2014 secular risk include utilities, business services, industrials, and disruptive companies like Amazon, Google, and Netflix. Such businesses are likely to trade at higher valuations now than they did in the past.\n\nThese secular changes do not always mean the same dollars move from one company to another in the S&P 500.\n\nGiroux said that \"it's not like you take $1 of profit from IBM and it becomes $1 for Amazon\" as companies move to Amazon's cloud, because cloud computing costs less. Some of the revenue leaving public companies is also going to the private side.\n\nGiroux said secular shifts affected industries at different rates.\n\n\"Sometimes it's a slow bleed\" with an industry like packaged foods that might \"slowly slide\" from 4% organic growth annually to no growth, he said. Others, like cable, seem to shift overnight, as consumers' preferences move quickly.\n\n\"It's all over the map,\" Giroux said.", "The Philadelphia 76ers and Minnesota Timberwolves completed the first blockbuster trade of the NBA season on Saturday, sending Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton to the 76ers in exchange for Dario Saric, Robert Covington, Jarryd Bayless, and a 2020 second-round pick.\n\nThe move ended the two-month-long saga, in which Butler demanded a trade from the Wolves while the Wolves played hardball with other teams.\n\nNow the 76ers are undoubtedly one of the most talented teams in the Eastern Conference, joining Butler with Joel Embiid, an early MVP candidate, and Ben Simmons, the reigning Rookie of the Year.\n\nBut the trade is a massive gamble. One league source described the move as a \"high risk, high reward\" situation. If Butler, Embiid, and Simmons can blend, the Sixers should be an elite defensive unit, with enough shot-creation to compete with anybody.\n\nBut the opposing scenario goes something like this: Butler and Embiid's high-energy, candid leadership style clash; the team can't find the spacing to put around its three stars, and the team falls short of winning at least two playoff series this spring.\n\nThe on-court fit should work\n\nIn the aftermath of the trade, there was some immediate concern about Butler's fit with the 76ers.\n\nThe 76ers are already light on shooting \u2014 Simmons doesn't take shots beyond the free throw line, Markelle Fultz's shot is broken, and Embiid can space the floor but is more effective in the post. In moving Covington and Saric, the Sixers' only reliable shooter may be J.J. Redick.\n\nButler isn't a true floor-spacer as a career 34% three-point shooter. However, one assistant coach told Business Insider that, regardless of his three-point shooting prowess, defenses have to respect Butler as a scorer \u2014 they won't just abandon him off the ball.\n\nSixers head coach Brett Brown can also get creative with his three stars. The Sixers have had some success using the 6-foot-10 Simmons as a screener in the pick-and-roll, and Butler has improved as a pick-and-roll ball-handler. Even when teams switch on the pick-and-rolls, but both Butler and Simmons can bully smaller players in the post.\n\nButler's impact may be felt the most at the end of games. Because of Simmons' lack of shooting, he can struggle to create shots for himself. That leaves Embiid and Redick to do the heavy lifting, but it's not either player's forte.\n\nButler, however, can go one-on-one, hit pull-ups from anywhere on the court, and get to the line. The Sixers' offense with Butler will probably bog down at times, but he'll bring welcomed shot-creation skills when the team needs a bucket most.\n\nAre the Sixers done making moves?\n\nAs the Sixers currently stand, they're a top-heavy team with an uninspiring bench. Despite the ways Butler, Simmons, and Embiid could blend on the floor, the Sixers will need to get deeper, and they'll need more shooting.\n\nWhile speaking to Business Insider, two league sources pondered if the 76ers might still make more moves. The easiest and best way for the Sixers to add to their team would be through buyouts. The Sixers benefitted greatly last season when they were able to add proven veterans and shooters in Ersan Ilyasova and Marco Belinelli after they were bought out after the trade deadline.\n\nThat could happen again, and it wouldn't cost the Sixers any assets. Carmelo Anthony is looking likely to hit the open market, though there have been conflicting reports about whether the Sixers would be interested.\n\nThe Sixers could also wait on teams like the Cleveland Cavaliers to potentially buy out some players like J.R. Smith or Kyle Korver and try to sign them mid-season.\n\nMatt Slocum/AP\n\nBut if the Sixers don't wait for buyouts, they may explore the trade market.\n\nOne league source said it would not be surprising if the Sixers explore the market for second-year guard Markelle Fultz. The same source said Fultz's trade value is likely in the negative, given his struggles on the floor this year. It's unclear what teams would give up for Fultz (or what the Sixers would have to include), but he may be their best non-draft-pick asset.\n\nRead more: One year after a strange saga where he was unable to shoot, Markelle Fultz looks like he's regressing again\n\nThe Sixers also have a tradeable asset in the Phoenix Suns' unprotected 2021 first-round pick, which they acquired on draft night by trading Mikal Bridges for Zhaire Smith. Brown admitted after the trade that that pick could be useful in future deals.\n\nA monster financial commitment looms\n\nMike Ehrmann/Getty The Sixers' trade for Butler is a massive gamble because the results could portend an expensive future for the club.\n\nBy trading for Butler, the Sixers can offer him a five-year, $190 million contract when he becomes a free agent this summer. The most other teams could offer is four years, $140 million.\n\nESPN reported at the time of the trade that there is an understanding that the Sixers and Butler will make a long-term commitment this summer.\n\nEmbiid's contract extension kicked in this year and he's owed $122 million over the next four years, though it's not all guaranteed. Simmons and the Sixers could discuss rookie contract extensions next fall.\n\nThe Sixers are slated to have cap space this summer, and they could use that cap space, then go over the cap to re-sign Butler afterward.\n\nThat's what makes this six-month experiment so crucial. This offseason is perhaps the Sixers' last with meaningful cap space barring any major changes. If Butler can coexist with Simmons and Embiid, the Sixers will have a star trio locked up, with cap space to tinker with their supporting cast. That's a rare position to be in in the NBA.\n\nBut operating a team with three players on max deals isn't easy. Some people in the NBA world are also hesitant about handing a max contract to Butler. Butler will turn 30 next season and has a lot of miles on his legs in addition to some injuries. A max contract would take him to 35 years old when he's likely to be on the back-end if not out of his prime altogether.\n\nThe Sixers won't have a lot of options. Someone will offer Butler a max contract this offseason if the Sixers do not, and while they could let Butler walk and use their cap space to lure another star, who is available?\n\nThe Sixers didn't get a meeting with Paul George last summer and were also-rans for LeBron James. Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant could be available this summer, but their preferences seem to be a mystery to most. Klay Thompson seems likely to stay in Golden State, leaving the Sixers to chase players like Kemba Walker and Khris Middleton \u2014 star players, to be sure, but maybe not the pieces to push the team into championship contention.\n\nAfter years of slowly rebuilding, the Sixers made the long-awaited move for an established star player. Butler isn't a seamless fit with the team, but he was the rare superstar available, the type of elite player Brown said the Sixers needed to add. If the trade works, the Sixers could find themselves competing for the Finals. If it doesn't, it's a step back for a team that's been trying to find a way to take a crucial step forward.", "Business Insider Intelligence is continually adding new types of coverage to better serve our subscribers.

A key strategy was to focus on new customer acquisition \u2014 and attract high-growth potential customer groups who may not have previously considered Amex \u2014 as a way of bolstering new growth. One such group was millennials, who are less likely than other generations to have a credit card and particularly apt to value offerings that Amex sees as strengths, like rewards. But the space is competitive, thanks to popular cards like Chase Sapphire Reserve, which means that Amex needed to differentiate and launch features that complement its robust rewards program to help it stand out from other providers looking to attract a similar group.\n\nStrategy\n\nOffering flexible payment options to cardholders could be one way to attract and engage younger users. Amex has been looking to offer products that cater to \"a lot of different customers,\" including millennials, who value flexible payment options \u2014 60% of millennials are interested in noncredit card financing options for big purchases, a figure well above the 42% of the general population that feels the same way. Amex could have opted to play into that interest by launching Pay It Plan It for cardholders with the majority of its products, including cobrands, as a way of giving users a more tailored subset of payment options beyond either paying cards off in full or carrying a balance that amasses interest. By increasing flexibility, Amex could encourage millennial users to pick up its credit cards, and spend more on them rather than using other payment methods or those from competitors.\n\nWant to read the rest of this case study, along with all the others we're producing on a weekly basis?", "The train takes longer than flying and, for some trips, it doesn't make sense.

However, they say \"such surveillance may be rapidly overcome, disabled or removed.\"\n\n\"Moreover, personal CAVs will likely be immune from such surveillance,\" they say. \"Such private CAVs may also be put to commercial use, as it is just a small leap to imagine Amsterdam's Red Light District 'on the move.'\"\n\nRead more: Waymo's first commercial self-driving rides could happen as soon as December: report\n\nThis is only the beginning of research into how autonomous cars could affect tourism, as most research has gone into their effect on traffic and commuting.

They're reliable, they look great ... and they tend to spend many months of the year tucked away on a shelf instead of on my feet. Why? Because they're just not winter boots.\n\nBoots have to provide two qualities to be suitable for use during the winter: insulation and water-resistance. If your boots can't help keep your feet warm and they can't keep your feet dry, then they're just not suitable for wintertime use. And of those two imperative qualities, waterproofing is the most important factor.\n\nOnce your socks grow sodden after snow, slush, or rain inundate your footwear, the insulation properties of the boots are no longer of much importance. In the winter, a wet foot is going to be a cold foot, and one more prone to blisters and infection. So while you can always help keep your feet warm with a pair of socks (or with layered socks), you have to use waterproof boots if you'll be hiking, working, or just walking around in areas liable to see snowfall or rain during those colder months. It's no coincidence that most of the boots on our list have the word \"waterproof\" right in the product title.\n\nBut what makes a great winter boot, beyond the warmth and dryness? It's largely relative. You need a winter boot that offers sufficient traction for activities in which you partake, but you don't need the same level of aggressive tread pattern for slushy sidewalks as you do for snowbound trails. You want enough support to help prevent a rolled ankle if you slip on ice, but your winter work boots probably don't need a calf-high rise. You want a lacing system that's snug and secure, but you also want it to be as simple as possible, as you might be wearing gloves or dealing with frosty fingers.\n\nIn short, you need to choose a boot that fits the places in which you'll use it and the tasks at hand in said locations. Don't choose a winter boot because it has lots of nifty features that seem clever and keen; choose a winter boot that's going to serve your purposes. We've rounded up the best winter boots you can buy for different use cases and styles. Read on to see which of our picks is for you.\n\nHere are the best winter boots for men:\n\nUpdated on 11/13/2018 by Owen Burke: Updated prices and added new picks to replace out-of-stock items.\n\nRead on in the slides below to check out our top picks.", "Vice President Mike Pence is traveling through Asia with a message for China, and that is that the US \"will not be intimidated.\"\n\nFlying from Japan to Singapore Tuesday, the vice president's Air Force 2 airplane reportedly passed within 50 miles of Chinese outposts in the contested Spratly Islands. Speaking with The Washington Post's Josh Rogin, Pence characterized the flight as something of a \"freedom-of-navigation\" operation.\n\nAs Pence's aircraft was actually a good distance from the islands, his flyby in the South China Sea obviously did not serve as an official FONOP or even as a particularly-demonstrative overflight, like the flights occasionally conducted by US Air Force bombers.\n\nThe US military conducts FONOPS around the world on a regular basis, typically to signal that the US does not recognize a country's territorial claims. In the South China Sea, these operations have become less about territorial sovereignty and instead are about standing up to Chinal. In that sense, Pence's intentions were right on target.\n\nBeijing claims the vast majority of the South China Sea, and while China's extensive claims to the region were discredited by an international arbitration tribunal two years ago, the Chinese military has continued to strengthen its position in the important strategic waterway.\n\nChina has typically responded to US military activities in the region with critical rhetoric, but the situation escalated in late September during a tense showdown between the US and Chinese navies. A Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) Type 052C Luyang II-class guided-missile destroyer challenged the US Navy destroyer USS Decatur following its close patrol through the Spratlys.\n\nThis troubling incident, during which the two ships nearly collided, was preceded by multiple B-52 bomber overflights, which Beijing called \"provocative.\"\n\nDuring his flight to Singapore Tuesday, Pence reiterated some of the points he made during a tough speech on China at the Hudson Institute last month. \"We will not be intimidated. We will not stand down. We will continue to exercise freedom of navigation,\" he said, adding that if China refuses to play ball, \"then so be it. We are here to stay.\"\n\n\"We seek an Indo-Pacific where every nation \u2026 is free to follow its own path and pursue its own interests, where the seas and skies are open to all engaged in peaceful activity, and where sovereign nations grow stronger together,\" the vice president explained earlier in Tokyo.\n\nHe restated the Trump administration's position that \"authoritarianism and aggression have no place in the Indo-Pacific.\" Rising tensions between Washington and Beijing come amid what some observers are describing as a new Cold War.", "The White House on Tuesday slammed Sen.

Outrage.\"", "In an attempt to address what government regulators are calling an \"epidemic\" of teen vaping, the Silicon Valley startup Juul will stop selling its flavored e-cigarettes in all retail stores, including convenience stores, vape shops, and gas stations.\n\nIt's the company's most sweeping change since it began selling its sleek, flash-drive-esque e-cigs in the summer of 2017.\n\nBut it's only temporary. The company said it would resume selling its flavored products to stores once they agree to adopt Juul's new age restrictions and a stronger system for making sure customers are at least 21 years old.\n\n\"As of this morning, we stopped accepting retail orders for our Mango, Fruit, Creme, and Cucumber Juul pods to the over 90,000 retail stores that sell our product, including traditional tobacco retailers (e.g., convenience stores) and specialty vape shops,\" Juul CEO Kevin Burns said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nJuul said it would continue to offer mint-, menthol- and tobacco-flavored products in stores because those flavors are available in combustible cigarettes.\n\nRead more: Experts are calling out a vape pen with 'scary' nicotine levels that teens love \u2014 here's how it affects the brain\n\nScientists and public-health advocates have been nearly unanimous in voicing approval of the move, which they say is a good first step toward helping protect young people by making the products less appealing and harder to purchase. But some say it doesn't go far enough.\n\nAt the moment, Juul is the top e-cig brand, making up nearly 80% of the e-cig market. On Friday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was preparing to voluntarily pull its flavored products from brick-and-mortar stores ahead of an expected Food and Drug Administration ban on flavors.\n\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and several scientists have said they're particularly concerned about Juul because of its uniquely high concentrations of nicotine, a highly addictive substance, as well as its appealing fruit and mint flavors.\n\n\"We're deeply concerned about the epidemic of youth use of e-cigs,\" Gottlieb said on Twitter on Tuesday. \"Voluntary action is no substitute for regulatory steps #FDA will soon take. But we want to recognize actions by JUUL today and urge all manufacturers to immediately implement steps to start reversing these trends.\"\n\nA study published in October suggested a \"rapid uptake\" of Juul use among young people, including minors, and several researchers have said the flavors are an especially appealing part of the product.\n\nResearchers and public-health advocates have also praised the expected FDA ban, which they said was another important starting point.\n\n\"From my perspective as a pediatrician, I think this is a step in the right direction in limiting sales and marketing of e-cigarettes to adolescents and young adults,\" Nicholas Chadi, a clinical pediatrics fellow at Boston Children's Hospital, told Business Insider.\n\nA focus on flavors\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health\n\nSweet e-cigarette flavors like apple pie and watermelon have been a focus of the FDA and other public-health agencies.\n\nIn a September statement announcing steps the FDA was taking to curb teen vaping, Gottlieb said the agency was \"seriously considering a policy change that would lead to the immediate removal of these flavored products from the market.\"\n\nIn Juul's statement about its decision, it directly acknowledged Gottlieb's concerns \u2014 a significant change for the company, which has previously defended its flavors by saying they play an important role for adults looking to switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigs.\n\n\"Our data show that flavors play a critical role in adult smokers' ability to switch from combustible cigarettes, but we must prevent youth access,\" Burns said on Tuesday.\n\nAn effort to address Juul's social-media problem\n\nShutterstock\n\nAnother part of Juul's statement outlines a plan to address its marketing on social media, including deleting its accounts.\n\n\"We are attacking the presence of Juul Labs on social media in two ways \u2014 eliminating our own social media accounts and continuing to monitor and remove inappropriate material from third-party accounts,\" Burns said.\n\nResearchers who've examined Juul's social-media campaigns \u2014 which have been posted on platforms popular with young people, like YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram \u2014 have described them as a runaway but problematic success.\n\nJuul stood out from other e-cigarette brands by advertising predominantly on social media as opposed to places like billboards or magazines, scientists said in a study published this summer in the journal Tobacco Control.\n\nRead more: $15 billion startup Juul used 'relaxation, freedom, and sex appeal' to market its creme-brulee-flavored e-cigs on Twitter and Instagram \u2014 but its success has come at a big cost\n\nThe campaigns took off, according to the researchers, who found that sales of the devices were \"highly correlated\" with the company's social-media posts.\n\nIn Tuesday's statement, Burns acknowledged that problem and said Juul's exit from social media was designed to address it. The company also said it would double down on existing efforts to flag and remove material it deems inappropriate from other accounts posting about Juul.\n\n\"There is no question that this user-generated social media content is linked to the appeal of vaping to underage users,\" Burns said. \"This is why we have worked directly with social media platforms to remove tens of thousands of inappropriate posts.\"\n\nSan Francisco's flavor ban may have paved the way for similar moves from Juul and the FDA\n\nOver the summer, the city of San Francisco banned the sale of flavored e-cigs and menthol cigarettes. Several big names, including Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, expressed support for the ban, suggesting it could spur similar moves in other cities.\n\n\"This vote should embolden other cities and states to act, because it demonstrates the public will not allow tobacco companies to stand in the way of policies that are proven to reduce smoking and save lives,\" he said in a statement.\n\nOther advocates and many researchers who study e-cigs agreed.\n\n\"Most scientists believe flavorings are used to target teenagers into becoming users,\" Ana Rule, a professor of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University who wrote a recent study on e-cigs and teens, told Business Insider this summer.\n\n\"There are, of course, many other factors, such as marketing and peer pressure,\" she added. \"But when you look at the flavoring names, one has to wonder.\"", "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not officially a member of Congress yet, but she's already making waves in Washington.\n\nJust weeks away from being sworn into office, Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday joined a climate change protest outside of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's office, high-fiving activists as she pushed for her Green New Deal.\n\nThe protest, led in part by the progressive political group Justice Democrats and the environmental group Sunrise Movement, was designed to urge Democratic leadership to aggressively address climate change after winning a majority in the House in the 2018 midterms.\n\nRead more: This is the platform that launched Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old democratic socialist, to become the youngest woman ever elected to Congress\n\nSpeaking with the protesters, Ocasio-Cortez said, \"I just want to let you all know how proud I am of each and every single one of you for putting yourselves and your bodies and everything on the line to make sure that we save our planet, our generation and our future. It's so incredibly important.\"\n\nThe protesters and Ocasio-Cortez called on Pelosi to create a new select committee on climate change, the Select Committee for a Green New Deal. The activists want the committee to have more teeth than the 2007 committee Pelosi established on the issue.\n\n'We have 10 years left to plan and implement a Green New Deal before cataclysmic climate disaster'\n\nPelosi responded to the demonstration in a statement, vowing to take action to address climate change.\n\n\"We are inspired by the energy and activism of the many young activists and advocates leading the way on the climate crisis, which threatens the health, economic security and futures of all our communities,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\"I have recommended to my House Democratic colleagues that we reinstate the select committee to address the climate crisis,\" Pelosi added. \"House Democrats ran on and won on our bold campaign for a $1 trillion investment in our infrastructure that will make our communities more resilient to the climate crisis, while creating 16 million new good-paying jobs across the country.\"\n\nPelosi also said she welcomed the presence of the activists and urged Capitol Police to allow them to continue to demonstrate and \"participate in our democracy.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2018. Pelosi says she's confident she will win enough support to be elected speaker of the House next year and that she is the best person for the job. J.

Pelosi is widely expected to once again assume the mantle of House Speaker and has long been one of the most powerful Democrats in Washington.\n\nRepublicans seemed to take pleasure in seeing the Democratic leader challenged by the tenacious soon-to-be congresswoman.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan's national press secretary reportedly sent an email with a photo of Ocasio-Cortez at the protest with the subject, \"huh, well this is unconventional.\"", "After a yearlong search, Amazon has finally announced where its new headquarters will be located.\n\nIn a blog post on Tuesday, the e-commerce giant crowned two winners for its second headquarters, known as HQ2: the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens, New York, and the newly formed National Landing area of Arlington, Virginia.\n\nOfficials from the two winning locations celebrated their victory online.\n\n\"When I took office, I said we would build a new New York State \u2014 one that is fiscally responsible and fosters a business climate that is attractive to growing companies and the industries of tomorrow ... New York can proudly say that we have attracted one of the largest, most competitive economic development investments in U.S. history,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said in Amazon's blog post announcing the HQ2 decision.\n\nGov. Ralph Northam of Virginia echoed those sentiments.\n\n\"This is a big win for Virginia - I'm proud Amazon recognizes the tremendous assets the Commonwealth has to offer and plans to deepen its roots here,\" he said. \"Virginia put together a proposal for Amazon that we believe represents a new model of economic development for the 21st century, and I'm excited to say that our innovative approach was successful.\"\n\nFor the remaining 18 cities on Amazon's shortlist that spent several months trying to lure Amazon but didn't make the cut, Tuesday's news may come as a big disappointment.\n\nBut that's not the case for everyone. Many people were rejoicing the news online, pointing out the various downfalls the sprawling headquarters could have brought to their city.\n\nThese people have most likely taken note of the impact Amazon's main headquarters has had on Seattle, where locals complain of skyrocketing rents, prolonged construction, gentrification, and gridlock traffic.\n\nBusiness Insider reported earlier this year that Seattle's median rent increased by nearly three times the national median from 2005 to 2015.\n\nRead more: 7 horrible things that could happen to cities if they win Amazon's HQ2 bid\n\nAmazon's decision to spread its new headquarters across two metropolitan areas should help to alleviate some of these issues, but there is still likely to be pressure on the nearby areas.\n\nReal-estate brokers in Long Island City saw a spike in inquiries for properties in the area after reports surfaced last week that Amazon was preparing to select it for HQ2. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Tuesday that brokers said they were selling property, sometimes sight-unseen, over text message. The Journal's story was published before Amazon had even made its official HQ2 announcement.\n\nWhile the overlooked cities won't be able to say they are Amazon's primary home, they can expect to see more of the e-commerce giant as it expands its reach in other ways.\n\n\"While other locations may be disappointed not to have secured Amazon's favor, it does not mean they will miss out entirely. Amazon is making enormous investments in warehousing, regional hubs and in retail stores,\" Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday.\n\n\"The company will expand both its customer-facing and back-end operations across America, and the world, in the years to come.\"\n\nRead more about Amazon's HQ2 project:", "Well, it's my new favorite Ferrari! And of course it is.\n\nYes, I like the entry-level California T (now called the Portofino) very much. I adore the 488 GTB and Spider (the latest mid-engine Ferraris), and I have much love for the GTC4 Lusso. But I hadn't ever driven the F12berlinetta.\n\nI had driven the V12 motor, which also lurks beneath the hood of the Lusso. But new 812 was something I craved: a pure two-seat GT car with mountains of naturally aspirated power. This is the kind of power you can get lost in by yourself, or share with someone close. But it's private power. Intimate.\n\nAnd there's plenty of it.\n\nDid I say \"plenty\"? That's not the word.\n\nIt's endless power, not unlike what I enjoyed with the 755-horsepower Corvette ZR1.\n\nAt the legal speed limit in the 812 Superfast, you've barely roused the beast. On the freeway, you can finesse the throttle to dance the 6.5-liter under the hood \u2014 a bump in displacement from the F12's 6.3-liter \u2014 enjoying the snarls and growls, or you can shift gears yourself, using the elegant carbon-fiber paddles behind the steering wheel, and feel the snaps and jerks, the kicks to your spine and sternum, as you deploy the G-forces.\n\nWhen you've got an 8,900-rpm redline in front of you, you're unlikely to tap into the full effects of the engine. But you can tease yourself. All you're left with is the knowledge that so, so much of the 812 is out of reach. The car is really out of time, in this sense. It's from an era when you could point the radiator of a V12 south and cover hundreds of miles at well above three digits on the speedometer. The 812 is supposed to go 120 mph for hours on end.\n\nAir resistance is nothing, thanks to the assorted spoilers, aero effects, slashes, and sculptural cut-ins that enable the wind to pass through the 812's bodywork. There's a steady, comforting whoosh of wind, coupled with the unholy howls of the motor. You could listen to some music, but you might ask yourself why you would with such a satisfying natural din enveloping your reality.\n\nYes, succulence such as this costs big money. But the 812 is a Ferrari for somebody who has made it. Besides, every dollar is worth it, has paid for something grand and special. Just think about amortizing the investment in the timeframe of forever.\n\nGiven that the V12 is so abundantly potent, it's easy to forget that the 812 Superfast is also supposed to be superfast in corners. The rear-wheel steering adds a nice assist, particularly if a touch of understeer sets in, and the electric steering is quite communicative. The 812 doesn't feel as sharp or darty as the 488 GTB, but it does feel as though you could dive into a curve and power through with aplomb.\n\nThe combination might well be threatened, however. A 6.5-liter V12 isn't designed for fuel economy, and Ferrari intends to shift its lineup in the direction of turbos and hybrids. At some point, gone will be the distinctive pleasures of a monster motor joined to flamboyant styling and an elegant but purposeful interior. Gone as well will be that monster motor engaged in the elemental process of taking high-octane fuel, squirting it into a dozen narrow chambers, adding air, making it explode, and transforming that constrained violence into velocity and near-sacred noise.\n\nThe bottom line is that all the Ferraris currently on sale are great, each in its own way. But the 812 Superfast is special. It is fast. It is beautiful. It can command a road, any road. And it links the driver to a time when the bigness of an engine and the ability of a motor car to stun were joined.\n\nThat makes the 812 a dinosaur. But it also makes it the most magnificent dinosaur imaginable. And an Italian one, on top of everything else.", "The payments industry is transforming.\n\nNoncash payments methods are quickly becoming the norm.

The reorganisation comes just four days after Google announced it was hiring big-name healthcare CEO David Feinberg to head up its healthcare initiatives.\n\nThe company's founders, Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis, wrote in a blog post that the change was a \"major milestone\" for the unit, and that it would mean DeepMind's Streams app, which aims to improve patient care, would be put into practice. Notably, Streams is not itself AI-powered.\n\nSee also: Google's DeepMind AI can accurately detect 50 types of eye disease just by looking at scans\n\nThe founders wrote wrote: \"It's been a phenomenal journey to see Streams go from initial idea to live deployment, and to hear how it's helped change the lives of patients and the nurses and doctors who treat them.\n\n\"The arrival of world-leading health expert Dr. David Feinberg at Google will accelerate these efforts, helping to make a difference to the lives of millions of patients around the world.\"\n\nThe move may cause some consternation.\n\nStreams was at the centre of some controversy in 2017 when the UK's data watchdog ruled that a British hospital hadn't taken enough care when sharing patient data with DeepMind early in the app's development. The watchdog did not stop DeepMind from continuing to use or develop Streams. But privacy campaigners worry that DeepMind's ultimate parent firm Google, whose core business model relies on data, may try and suck up patient information to benefit its bottom line.\n\nDeepMind had set up an independent board to probe its approach to privacy and its business model, in part to address those concerns. A spokeswoman confirmed the board was unlikely to continue after the consolidation.\n\nStreams isn't the only product from DeepMind's healthcare team, which also has various research projects underway such as the use of artificial intelligence to detect eye disease, and planning cancer radiotherapy treatment. Suleyman said the team behind Streams would remain in London and report to the DeepMind health team's clinical lead, Dominic King.\n\nDeepMind said it was still committed to its existing partnerships and research projects with UK hospitals. \"Information governance and safety remain our top priorities,\" the founders wrote. \"Patient data remains under our partners' strict control, and all decisions about its use will continue to lie with them.\"", "A top-of-the-line Norwegian warship collided with a tanker last week, causing the crew to intentionally run the ship aground to try to save it.

The company will receive billions of dollars in tax breaks from both cities, but that didn't quite seal the deal.

Any new construction would be at the Company's sole expense, and, in order to minimize disruption to the surrounding communities, the Company agrees to: (i) limit flights and landings to corporate use by the Company; (ii) cooperate with the Public Parties in selecting the least disruptive feasible location on the Development Sites; (iii) restrict landings to no more than 120 per year; and(iv) require that all flights be exclusively over water or the Development Sites, to the extent consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nIf Amazon can't have a helipad directly on its New York site, it will settle for the \"least disruptive\" nearby location, and promises to use the helipad no more than 120 times per year.", "Nashville didn't snag one of Amazon's two new HQ2 locations.

So why is Microsoft releasing the October update now?\n\nIt's because the first rollout of the update, which happened back in the real, literal October, didn't go so well for some users. Some said that installing the October 2018 Update actually wiped some of their internal files, while others reported that they had significantly worse battery life. Microsoft \"paused\" the update while it investigated.\n\nNow, Microsoft says that it's cracked the case, and the update should be clear for launch \u2014 but that it's going to be more cautious than usual until it's completely and totally confident that these issues are fixed. Specifically, Microsoft is slowing down the normal process by which Windows 10 forces users to update to the newest version.\n\nThe way Microsoft rolls out Windows 10 updates is thus: First, Microsoft makes the update available to a self-selected group of early adopters, who have to either download it directly from Microsoft's website, or manually run Windows Update to find it. In other words, if you want it first, you have to go get it.\n\nThis is as far as the October 2018 Update got the last time before Microsoft hit the pause button. Today, Microsoft is bringing the Windows 10 October 2018 Update back to this stage, so this is how you'll get it.\n\nThen, after everything goes well, Microsoft will start bringing it to users in waves, prioritizing those users with PC configurations that it knows will handle the update well, and gradually trickling down from there.\n\nThis time, though, Microsoft said it's going to be far more cautious about approving the update for users \u2014 if Windows 10 detects any kind of anomaly in your PC setup, whatsoever, the update simply won't appear for you. You won't get bugged to install it, you won't be able to download it via Windows 10, no, nada. Then, Microsoft will review that data to figure out how to work around the problem and make sure you won't run into that nasty bug.\n\nIn a broader sense, Microsoft says that it's reforming the way that it develops and tests Windows updates to make sure that this never happens again \u2014 users in the Windows Insider beta-testing program had reported this bug well before it went out to users, but Microsoft missed it thanks to a flaw in its feedback process. In a blog entry, the first in a series, Microsoft goes into depth about its testing process and its plans to fix it up for next time.\n\nAnyway, if you're able to install the Windows 10 October 2018 Update, you'll find yourself with all kinds of tweaks to the operating system, chief among them, a new way to integrate your PC with an Android phone.", "US Air Force Pararescue specialists, or PJs, are one of the most elite special operators in the world.\n\nConsisting of about 500 airmen, PJs \"rescue and recover downed aircrews from hostile or otherwise unreachable areas,\" according to the Air Force.\n\nThese \"highly trained experts perform rescues in every type of terrain and partake in every part of the mission, from search and rescue, to combat support to providing emergency medical treatment, in order to ensure that every mission is a successful one.\"\n\n\"One of the challenges [in Afghanistan] is the altitude and terrain because we are surrounded by mountains,\" Maj.

AP Photo/Paul Sancya\n\nConventional wisdom holds that your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should be no longer than one page.\n\nAt least that's what most r\u00e9sum\u00e9 coaches will tell you.\n\nBut new research suggests that job recruiters were more than twice as likely to prefer two-page resumes over one-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2014 a conclusion that surprised even the researchers.\n\nAs part of an experiment, r\u00e9sum\u00e9-writing service ResumeGo presented almost 20,000 one- and two-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to a pool of 482 job recruiters, hiring managers, HR professionals, and C-suite executives. The participants were put through a three-week \"hiring simulation\" in which they were asked to screen the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for a variety of job positions comprising different levels of work experience.\n\nAcross the board, the participants were more likely to prefer the two-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Out of the 7,712 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s they approved, 5,375 of them were two pages long, while just 2,337 were one page long.\n\nThe results were especially pronounced when it came to higher-level job positions. The participants were 2.9 times as likely to prefer two-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for managerial-level positions and 2.6 times as likely for midlevel positions.\n\nBut the results held up even when it came to entry-level workers \u2014 traditionally the group that is most cautioned against exceeding one page. Participants were 1.4 times as likely to prefer two-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, even for those positions, the researchers found.\n\n\"While the overwhelming majority of career experts argue that a two-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9 should never be used unless a job seeker has many years of full-time work experience at multiple companies, our results contradict this piece of conventional wisdom,\" ResumeGo CEO Peter Yang said in a statement.\n\nRead more: 10 ways to fix your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 when you're not entry-level anymore\n\nNot only did the two-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9s perform better than the one-pages ones, the participants in the experiment also spent significantly more time reading them, bucking the notion that job recruiters will gloss over lengthier r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. They spent an average of four minutes and five seconds going over the two-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, compared to just two minutes and 24 seconds on the one-page examples.\n\nIt's worth noting that the experiment only accounted for the preferences of human r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screeners, and not the software programs companies are using with increasing frequency.\n\nFor Yang, the results prove how little we actually know about the art of r\u00e9sum\u00e9-writing, and how much of the advice you hear isn't necessarily based in fact. As he noted, there has been barely any scientific research looking into the ideal r\u00e9sum\u00e9 length.\n\n\"It's one of the frustrating things in the industry. I would go online to see what experts had to say about this or that, and people were kind of just giving out tips from their own opinions, not grounded in any real evidence,\" Yang told Business Insider.\n\n\"Furthermore, recruitment methods and the hiring landscape are constantly evolving,\" he said in the ResumeGo announcement. \"So what may have been true in the past may no longer be the case today.\"", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider may receive a commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nCapital One today announced major improvements to its Venture line of credit cards, making its flagship card \u2014 the Capital One Venture Rewards card\u2014 arguably a must-have for any award traveler.\n\nThere are a few different kinds of credit card rewards, but generally, the most valuable kind is transferable points. That means that you can transfer the points you earn from everyday spending to certain partners; generally, airline frequent flyer programs. Transferability generally offers the most flexibility, allowing you a few different redemption options, and give points a higher potential value.\n\nUntil now, the only way to redeem Capital One Venture miles was to apply them as a statement credit against specific purchases that were classified as travel, with each mile being worth 1\u00a2.\n\nToday, Capital One announced that beginning next month, Venture cardholders will be able to transfer their miles to any of 12 new airline frequent flyer partners, significantly increasing the potential value of Capital One miles.\n\nCardholders will continue to have the option of using miles to erase travel purchases, and every other feature about the card will remain unchanged. Those with the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card\u2014 a no-annual-fee, but slower-earning sibling to the Venture\u2014 will also be able to transfer points to airline frequent flyer partners, as will those with the Capital One Spark Miles for Business and the Capital One Spark Miles Select for Business credit cards.\n\nThe 12 airline partners are:\n\nAeromexico\n\nAir Canada Aeroplan\n\nAir France/KLM\n\nAlitalia\n\nAvianca\n\nCathay Pacific\n\nEtihad\n\nEVA\n\nFinnair\n\nHainan\n\nQantas\n\nQatar\n\nThe reason that transferable points are more valuable is because booking frequent flyer \"award tickets\" is different than buying reservations outright \u2014 you can read more about how it works here. In most cases, the cash price and the miles price of a ticket aren't linked, so in a scenario where a ticket's cash price is high, but its award price is low, you can get more value from your credit card points by transferring them to the relevant frequent flyer program and booking the flight as an award ticket. The alternative \u2014 paying with your card and using points to \"erase\" the purchase \u2014 would mean you spend many more credit card points in that scenario.\n\nCapital One miles will transfer to each partner at a ratio of 2:1.5 \u2014 meaning you'll get 1.5 airline miles for every 2 Capital One miles. While many other programs \u2014 like American Express' Membership Rewards program or Chase's Ultimate Rewards \u2014 offers 1:1 transfer ratios, the Capital One Venture earns unlimited 2x miles on every single purchase, regardless of purchase category or country.\n\nThat means that for every dollar you spend, you'll effectively earn 1.5 airline miles (if you decide to transfer Capital One miles to the airline).\n\nWhile the Capital One Venture has long been a solid rewards credit card \u2014 at least, for a card that earned fixed-value rewards points \u2014 the ability to transfer miles to airline partners elevates it to one of the more competitive cards available.\n\nRead more: Lucrative credit card deals you can get when opening a new card in November \u2014 including a 150,000-point bonus\n\nAdding to the card's value: the ability to earn a tremendous 10x miles on every dollar spent on hotel bookings when you book and pay through Hotels.com/Venture. Given the 2:1.5 transfer ratio, that means earning up to 7.5 airline miles per dollar spent on hotels. Hotels.com also operates its own loyalty program that offers a free night after 10 paid nights.\n\nGiven the airline transfer ability, combined with the earning rate of 10x miles on hotels through the Venture portal, and 2x miles on everything else, along with other benefits added by Capital One this year, the Capital One Venture has rapidly ascended to be one of the most potentially valuable rewards credit cards of 2018 \u2014 even if the partner airlines aren't quite as useful as Chase's.\n\n\"The benefit will provide more ways for customers to maximize redemptions and enjoy memorable travel experiences,\" said Lauren Liss, a vice president of Capital One's US card business.\n\nTo top off the announcement, Capital One is offering a 50% higher sign-up bonus for new applicants, but only for a limited time \u2014 an end date hasn't been announced.\n\nThe current bonus is 75,000 miles when you spend $5,000 on the card in the first three months \u2014 up from 50,000 miles. That's worth $750 of travel when used to erase travel purchases, or potentially more when transferred to airline miles \u2014 you'd get 56,250 airline miles at the 2:1.5 ratio.\n\nThere's an additional limited time offer of up to an incredibly 200,000 miles on the Spark Miles for Business card\u2014 50,000 miles after your business spends $5,000 in the first three months, and an additional 150,000 miles after spending $50,000 in the first six months. Those 200,000 Capital One miles would transfer to 150,000 airline miles.\n\nThese bonuses may not be around for long, so this is the time to apply for the cards, especially if you can use holiday shopping and travel to help meet the minimum spending requirement. The Capital One Venture has a $95 annual fee, but it's waived the first year. The Spark Miles has the same annual fee.", "General Electric announced Tuesday plans to accelerate the reduction of its stake in Baker Hughes, an oilfield-services provider.\n\nGE will sell as many as 166.2 million Baker Hughes shares, which could raise $4 billion based on Monday's closing price, according to a statement.\n\nCEO Larry Culp told CNBC Monday that he would cut the company's leverage by selling assets.\n\nWatch General Electric trade live.\n\nGeneral Electric jumped as much as 8% Tuesday after the company announced plans to slash its stake in the oilfield-services provider Baker Hughes.\n\nGE will sell as many as 101.2 million Baker Hughes shares through a secondary offering and Baker Hughes has agreed to buy back another 65 million shares in a private transaction, according to a statement.

Otherwise, each of the 28 EU members really have different goals, and Menon says it's almost impossible that the countries could ever agree on an objective.\n\nRead more: Trump torches allies, threatens NATO pullout after tense WWI memorial trip to Paris\n\n\"Given divergent national interests such a force, if created, would certainly almost never be deployed,\" Franz Stefan-Gady, an Austrian-born military analyst tweeted. \"[S]uch a force will just create additional layers\" of red tape, wrote Stefan-Gady.\n\n\"The EU can bring together foreign policy, policing policy, and intelligence coordination.

Germany is \"rather suspicious of French initiatives,\" said Menon.\n\nFrance has one of the bigger and more active militaries in Europe.

The City of New York\n\nThe battle for HQ2 is finally over.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a blog post, Amazon named the two winners of its HQ2 project: Long Island City in Queens, New York, and the newly formed National Landing area of Arlington, Virginia.\n\nThe much-anticipated news comes after a year-long search that started with 238 proposals that were whittled down to a short list of 20 sites at the beginning of the year.\n\nRead more: Amazon officially announces its HQ2 will be split between New York and Virginia\n\nAmazon had initially said it planned to invest over $5 billion and accommodate as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs with its new HQ2. As a result, cities and states leaped at the chance to win over the e-commerce giant, putting together proposals for suitable sites and even offering tax incentives to sweeten the deal.\n\nNew York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo even said he'd change his name to Amazon Cuomo to woo the company.\n\nOn Tuesday, both Cuomo and New York City's Mayor Bill de Blasio praised Amazon's decision to pick New York.\n\n\"New York City is about to get tens of thousands of new, good paying jobs and Amazon is about to meet the most talented work force in the world in one of the most diverse places on the planet. Welcome to Queens, #HQ2,\" de Blasio wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"When I took office, I said we would build a new New York State - one that is fiscally responsible and fosters a business climate that is attractive to growing companies and the industries of tomorrow ... New York can proudly say that we have attracted one of the largest, most competitive economic development investments in U.S. history,\" Cuomo said in Amazon's blog post.\n\nThe exact terms of New York's deal with Amazon had been laid out in a series of documents, signed by The City of New York, two city organizations, and a representative of Amazon. These documents were published online on Tuesday.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways:\n\nWhere will the new headquarters be?\n\nThe new headquarters will be located close to the waterfront in Long Island City, between 46th Avenue and 44th Road.\n\nThe new offices will occupy four million square feet of space, with the opportunity to expand to eight million square feet in the future.\n\nThe offices will be housed in a mix of private and public buildings including the office of the Department of Education, which will be relocated from Vernon Boulevard.\n\nOnce the city has agreed to Amazon's design proposals, construction will begin within 12 months.\n\nAmazon has agreed to donate space on its campus for a tech startup incubator and for use by artists and industrial businesses. It has also agreed to donate a site for a new primary or intermediary public school.\n\nThe company will also invest in infrastructure improvements and new green spaces.\n\nShutterstock\n\nHow many employees will Amazon hire?\n\nAmazon will hire 25,000 people within the next 10 years. It said that these employees would have an average annual wage of $150,000. The hiring kicks off with 700 people, who will join the new offices in 2019.\n\nIf Amazon grows the headquarters in the future, around 40,000 people could be hired in total.\n\nHow much will Amazon invest in the local community?\n\nIn total, Amazon will invest nearly $3.7 billion over the next 15 years.\n\nThis includes a $5 million investment in funding workforce development initiatives, including technology training programs and internships for local students.\n\nWhat tax incentives will Amazon receive?\n\nIf Amazon keeps up to its end of the bargain by creating 25,000 jobs, it is eligible to receive direct incentives of $1.525 billion. These are rebates on tax paid on employees salaries and reimbursements for building the new offices.\n\nThe extras\n\nOne of Amazon's key requests is to have a helipad at both headquarters. In the terms, the city agreed to help secure access to an alternative helipad if it is unable to build its own at HQ.\n\nAP/Frank Franklin II", "HBUS, the US-based strategic partner of crypto exchange Huobi, has poached a venture capitalist from Draper Athena as the firm ups its investment and acquisition activities to win a share of the US market from companies like Coinbase and Robinhood.\n\nJay Ryu is joining HBUS as vice president of corporate development, overseeing strategic partnerships, investments, and mergers and acquisitions, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nThe new appointment comes at a time when investments and M&A are surging in the crypto field. According to data from JPM Securities and PitchBook, the number of crypto M&A deals has soared by more than 200% to 115 this year.\n\n\"The community is rapidly maturing and with that, many more institutional investors have entered the market,\" Ryu said in a statement. \"HBUS stands at the forefront of this next wave of blockchain innovation, and I am excited to lead our efforts as we become the top US digital currency exchange with a diverse array of products and solutions for these investors.\"\n\nRyu was previously the venture capital director at Draper Athena, a VC firm that is part of the Draper Venture Network and focused on investments in information technology startups.

Both will get roughly half of the promised HQ2 investment \u2014 $2.5 billion and 25,000 jobs \u2014 dumped on the cities throughout the next 10 years.\n\nArlington, Virginia and New York City have both offered Amazon millions in incentives in exchange for the privilege of choosing sites in two districts.\n\nThat's about where the similarities stop, though. The two packages offered by the cities and states are wildly different.\n\nFirst off is the total package size. All told Virginia offered a sizable $573 million in performance-based direct incentives. But New York opened its purse strings wide and has offered to the tune of $1.525 billion.\n\nBoth are based on the company's promise to hire for 25,000 jobs, and will be paid over the next 10-15 years.\n\nNew York State's Excelsior Program is responsible for $1.2 billion of the New York incentive number. It was calculated based on the salaries Amazon expects to pay employees over the next 10 years. Taking into account an average wage Amazon estimates will exceed $150,000, that equals about $48,000 of state subsidy per employee.\n\nThe $1.2 billion will be paid over the next 10 years, as hiring for the new office ramps up. New York is also giving a $325 million cash grant based on the 4 million to 8 million square feet of office space it intends to occupy, courtesy of Empire State Development.\n\nAmazon has also said it will apply for other incentives including New York City's Industrial & Commercial Abatement Program (ICAP) and New York City's Relocation and Employment Assistance Program (REAP).\n\nThe smaller package offered by Virginia includes a similar incentive. Virginia will offer Amazon $22,000 for each job the company hires for in the office over the next 12 years. Using for calculation of the predicted 25,000 jobs, that will equal $550 million.\n\nIn addition to that, Amazon will also get a cash grant from Arlington for $23 million if the company is able to grow the city's tax on local hotel rooms over the next 15 years.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

But were you to listen to me play \"F\u00fcr Elise\" or \"Green Sleeves\" on The ONE Smart Keyboard Pro digital piano, you'd think I'd been at the keys for years (ok, maybe months). Note that I meant it when I said \"listen to me play\" because were you to watch me, my cover would be blown when you spotted the red and blue LED lights popping up above the next keys to be tapped.\n\nWhen paired with The ONE app, this full-sized, 88-key digital piano becomes a powerful teaching tool that can help the abject amateur and the advanced pianist alike. The most basic way to engage with the piano is to select a song and then dutifully follow the LED light prompts \u2014 a red light for the fingers of your right hand, a blue light for the left \u2014 striking the keys as the light illuminate. This sort of playing won't teach you much about music theory or have you reading Bach's sheet music, but it's satisfying to hammer out a tune the first time you sit down to tickle the keys.\n\nKristin John\n\nWhile having some fun tapping out songs is all well and good, let's be frank here: The ONE Smart Keyboard Pro is way too expensive to buy if all you plan to do is play around. But if you actually want to learn how to play, it's a lot cheaper to buy one pricey digital keyboard than it is to take lessons for years. And the last time I checked, an actual grand piano costs more than $10,000 if you want something halfway decent. Even uprights cost at least five grand for any real quality.\n\nI started off simply following the lights and slowly growing more comfortable playing a few select songs, but soon I realized I wasn't really learning how to play music, but rather how to memorize those specific tunes. However, as the LEDs lead your fingers, so too does the sheet music displayed on The ONE app highlight the notes corresponding to the keys you're playing. Over time, using the piano and app can develop both muscle memory in your fingers and an understanding of reading music. Put those together, and hey, you're a piano player.\n\nKristin John\n\nI'm not going to pretend you will learn to play the piano overnight with this keyboard, nor will you gain true competence in a matter of days or weeks or even months. Learning to play an instrument well takes time and effort, but with The ONE Smart Keyboard Pro, you can indeed learn to play \u2014 no teacher or traditional lessons required.\n\nSo yes, it's expensive, but it's effective. You'll also sound like you know what you're doing on day one \u2014 just don't let anyone see the red and blue lights helping you cheat your way through Pachabel's \"Canon.\"\n\nGet The ONE Smart Keyboard Pro from Amazon for $799", "The NBA world was stunned last season when star Gordon Hayward sustained a gruesome leg injury just minutes into his Boston Celtics career.\n\nNow, it appears Brooklyn Nets rising star Caris LeVert has suffered a similar fate.\n\nWith just 3.7 seconds remaining in the first half of the Nets' contest against the Minnesota Timberwolves, LeVert attempted a chase-down block on point guard Jeff Teague and came down hard on his right leg. Coaches, players, and fans looked on in horror as LeVert crumpled to the ground. He sat up to look at his leg before laying back down on the hardwood and submitting to medical attention. The arena was virtually silent until LeVert was stretchered off the floor and taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation.\n\n\"There was really just no words,\" teammate Joe Harris said after the game, per ESPN's Malika Andrews. \"We didn't talk even when we came in at halftime. There was nothing to be said. Guys were crying. It was really that horrific just to see.\"\n\nLeVert \u2014 who averaged 18.4 points per game on the season \u2014 looked well on his well to becoming a household name in Brooklyn. He had battled injuries in his junior and senior seasons with the Michigan Wolverines before missing part of his rookie campaign for foot surgery.\n\n\"He has done everything he could possibly do to put himself in a position to succeed, to do well and to be healthy, and then you just have a freak accident,\" Harris said. \"That's what makes it even tougher for all of us.\"\n\nMany of the biggest names in the NBA took to social media to express their support for LeVert after learning about his injury:\n\nFive-time NBA All-Star Paul George, who sustained a similarly terrible lower-leg injury during a USA Basketball scrimmage back in 2014 but has bounced back with the Oklahoma City Thunder, also offered some words of encouragement for the young player:\n\nThe Nets jumped out to a surprising 6-8 start on the season thanks in large part to LeVert's efforts. Head coach Kenny Atkinson recognizes that losing his young star will almost certainly derail Brooklyn's hot start.\n\n\"He is the heart and soul of our program,\" Atkinson said. \"It's a tough, tough blow for the Nets.\"", "It may not look likely right now, but the stock market is poised for a big rally into the end of the year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nIn fact, the firm's strategists hold this conviction precisely because of the turmoil that has rocked stocks over the past several weeks. Investors hold painful memories of October because three of the most painful crashes ever \u2014 in 1929, 1987, and 2008 \u2014 happened then. And last month turned out to be the worst for stocks in seven years.\n\n\"October is known for sharp market declines, but also known for creating market lows that lift stocks into a year-end rally,\" Mary Ann Bartels, an investment and exchange-traded-fund strategist, said in a note. \"We believe that the holiday rally is underway.\"\n\nBartels recommended that investors focus on large cap, high-quality companies, and noted that healthcare stocks are currently showing market leadership.\n\nRead more: A $2 trillion strategist warns that a trap has formed in the biggest tech stocks \u2014 and pinpoints where you should put your money instead\n\nShe also laid out some positive catalysts that could lead to a rebound before the year runs out.\n\nFor one, when stocks sold off last month, their stretched valuations got reined in. In addition, the rate of earnings growth may be peaking, but overall profits are still positive. And also importantly, the US economy is still in solid shape.\n\nThis expected rally won't be risk-free, however. Bartels anticipates that on the way up, stocks will get rockier because of the historical relationship between interest rates and volatility.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThe gap between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields has narrowed to almost zero this year, meaning that traders are demanding an increasing premium for holding short-term bonds versus their longer-term counterparts. It's a dynamic that has historically revealed the market's concerns about economic growth, signaled a policy error from the Federal Reserve, and highlighted the competition that stocks faced from safer, higher-yielding assets.\n\nAdditionally, no recession since the 1960s has happened without a yield-curve inversion, which occurs when the 2-year and 10-year yield spread falls below zero. It fell to an 11-year low of 19 basis points in August and was near 26 basis points on Tuesday.\n\nAll these factors contributed to more volatile stock trading, as measured by the Cboe volatility index, or VIX.\n\n\"Higher interest rates and the changing shape of the yield curve informs us that volatility or more extreme price movement should be expected,\" Bartels said.\n\nThere are other volatility triggers that bullish investors should consider. Within the stock market, Bartels said it was \"concerning\" that tech stocks, which until recently had led the market's gains, have not regained their footing after the recent correction.\n\nOn the macro side, Bartels pointed out the slowdown in the housing market as mortgage rates rise, China and trade concerns, and the prospect of the 10-year yield rising above 3.25%. Oil prices, which fell for a record 12th-straight day on Tuesday, pose a risk to other markets if they continue to decline.", "Arlington, Virginia, came out a winner in Amazon's grueling HQ2 competition \u2014 but one detail in the tech giant's Tuesday announcement left observers and Washington, DC-area natives scratching their heads.\n\nThe Seattle-based online retailer says it will split its new second headquarters between New York City and National Landing, Virginia.\n\nThe only thing is, most Virginians haven't heard of National Landing before.

Ocasio-Cortez said on Monday that she'd received an overwhelmingly negative response from her constituents in Long Island City, a fast-growing waterfront neighborhood just across the East River from Manhattan.\n\n\"Amazon is a billion-dollar company,\" she tweeted. \"The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.\"\n\nAmazon is likely to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in additional incentives from the city \u2014 available to any company \u2014 for employing New Yorkers in outer boroughs and for commercial development, The New York Times reported.\n\nAmazon said in its official announcement on Tuesday that it would create 25,000 \"full-time high-paying jobs\" and invest about $2.5 billion in its campus and related projects, including infrastructure and green-space development.\n\n\"Offering massive corporate welfare from scarce public resources to one of the wealthiest corporations in the world at a time of great need in our state is just wrong,\" City Council member Jimmy Van Bramer and state Sen. Michael Gianaris, both of whom represent Long Island City, said in a scathing joint statement on Sunday.\n\n\"We were not elected to serve as Amazon drones,\" they added.\n\nLocal politicians have also expressed concern that the secret dealmaking process between Amazon and the government circumvented community review and local input by using a state-level process that bypasses the authority of the City Council in zoning and land-use decisions.\n\nCity Council Speaker Corey Johnson said the lack of community involvement in the decision was \"extremely troubling.\"\n\n\"I will always advocate for economic development and jobs in New York, but when the process is done behind closed doors, with zero community input and nearly $2 billion in subsidies to a global behemoth, I am going to be skeptical,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe politicians voiced concern about the company's effect on rents and property values, which are likely to skyrocket in the neighborhood and surrounding areas, and the burden it could place on city infrastructure, including the struggling subway system.\n\nRead more: Amazon officially announces its HQ2 will be split between New York and Virginia\n\nThe reaction to the decision represents a deep rift between the city and state's Democratic leadership and New York City residents and their representatives.\n\nGov.

Acosta was attempting to ask President Donald Trump questions about his references to a migrant caravan as an \"invasion\" at the time.\n\nThe White House falsely accused Acosta of placing \"his hands\" on the intern in the wake of the incident last week.

This is a huge sum but it was recently revealed by Der Spiegel and Football Leaks that the club did actually deny Mbapp\u00e9 certain demands.\n\nThe newspaper says Mbapp\u00e9 wanted a contract worth $60 million, which PSG was willing to give, but rejected his request for the use of a private jet at the club's expense.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 has since admitted that the money involved in the sport is indecent. \"It's truly indecent for me, who comes from a fairly modest family,\" he said to the Swiss television channel RTS, according to Goal.com. \"It's true that it's indecent but the market is like that.\"\n\nMbapp\u00e9 then said that's just the way the sport is and he can't, or won't, change it: \"The world of football works like that. I'm not going to revolutionise football. I'm in a system. You have to know how to respect it and to stay in place.\"\n\nThough Mbapp\u00e9 is paid a huge sum of money to play sport, he remains charitable. He received an estimated $500,000 for helping France win the coveted World Cup tournament in the summer, but rather than pocket the cash, he donated it all to a charity that offers sporting opportunities to children who are hospitalized or have disabilities.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 is currently on international duty with the France team and is in line to feature in the country's upcoming matches against the Netherlands on Friday and Uruguay on November 20.", "LONDON \u2014 UK and EU negotiating teams have agreed on a Brexit withdrawal deal which Prime Minister Theresa May will present to her Cabinet on Wednesday.\n\nThe UK government confirmed reports that May's most senior ministers would read the details of the draft agreement on Tuesday evening before a special Cabinet meeting at 2 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nAn agreement between the UK and EU over how to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland as a result of Brexit was reached during intensive negotiations held on Monday and Tuesday, sources told Business Insider.\n\nBrexit talks had for weeks been at an impasse over the question of how a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could be avoided no matter the outcome of negotiations.\n\nUK and EU negotiators agreed that there would be a UK-wide \"backstop\" if they fail to negotiate a trade deal that negates the need for border checks on the island of Ireland before the end of the two-year Brexit transition period.\n\nThe backstop will take the shape of a UK-wide customs union with the EU, with Northern Ireland sticking to some of the European single market. This would guarantee no border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nHowever, the backstop is set not to come with a fixed end date, as demanded by pro-Brexit MPs, but with a \"review clause\" for deciding when it can come to an end.\n\nBrexiteers are concerned that this arrangement will leave the UK trapped in a customs union with the EU for years to come, unable to sign new free-trade deals. The UK would also have to continue following numerous EU rules in areas like the environment, employee protections and state aid.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, said the deal amounted to a \"failure to deliver on Brexit\" and would make a \"vassal state\" of Britain. His Conservative colleague Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, described the draft deal as \"unacceptable,\" adding, \"For the first time in a thousand years, this place, this Parliament will not have a say over the laws that govern this country.\"\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party would \"look at the details\" of the deal, \"but from what we know of the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country.\"\n\nHe added: \"Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to support jobs and the economy \u2014 and that guarantees standards and protections. If this deal doesn't meet our six tests and work for the whole country, then we will vote against it.\"\n\nThe breakthrough in negotiations means EU leaders might be able to ratify the deal at a summit in Brussels later this month. EU ambassadors are set to meet on Wednesday to discuss the next steps in the Brexit process.\n\nThe pound rose 1.4% against the dollar on the news on Tuesday.\n\nUK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab. WPA Pool/Getty\n\nWhat's next?\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab reportedly belongs to a handful of Cabinet Brexiteers who are prepared to resign from the government if the Brexit withdrawal agreement doesn't meet their demands.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last month that the Cabinet members Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt, and Esther McVey were all prepared to resign if May accepted a backstop with no fixed end date.\n\nLeadsom said on Sunday that MPs would not accept a backstop which the UK cannot leave without the EU's permission. She told the BBC: \"I don't think something that trapped the UK in any arrangement against our will would be sellable to members of Parliament.\"\n\nDowning Street understand that ministers could quit their positions over the details of the deal.\n\nHowever, the prime minister has pressed on despite the high-profile resignations of former ministers like Johnson and David Davis and would be likely to do so again.\n\nThe European Research Group of pro-Leave Conservative MPs met following the news. A Tory MP who attended told Business Insider the group was \"absolutely shell-shocked\" because none of May's \"promises\" to it had been kept.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox, Leadsom, and Mordaunt \"all campaigned with us for Brexit and need to stop this from ever reaching the Commons,\" the MP said.\n\nThe biggest challenge facing May will come in the House of Commons' vote on the deal.\n\nMost Labour MPs are set to vote against it, as well as Conservative MPs from the pro-Brexit and pro-EU wings of the party, and possibly the 10 MPs from the Democratic Unionist Party which props up May's government.\n\nThe DUP's Nigel Dodds said the party \"couldn't possibly vote for\" the deal. Pro-Brexit Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith said May's days are numbered as prime minister if she goes ahead with it.\n\nOwen Smith, a champion of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said the deal would leave \"the British people worse off, and our country weaker as a whole\" and urged May to put it to another referendum.\n\nHe added: \"It's not enough for May to secure support for her deal from Cabinet, or even from Parliament. This deal will dictate the course for our country for generations to come, and it must be put to the people for their approval or rejection.\"\n\nThe leaders of the four main opposition parties, including Corbyn and The Liberal Democrats' Vince Cable, have jointly written to May demanding a \"truly meaningful vote\" on the deal.", "From fitness models to mommy bloggers, social media is awash with influencers touting millions of followers and big brand connections.\n\nBut for financiers seeking an edge, a seemingly humble blog has become a mecca for the world's biggest money managers.

However, the growth rate of 27% was the lowest in the event's 10-year history.\n\nOver the last decade, Singles Day has become a symbol of Alibaba's success and the company's massive customer base. Alibaba turned the day of deals into a festival, with a gala that included a performance by Mariah Carey and an e-commerce themed acrobatics act from Cirque du Soleil. Hundreds of journalists from around the world attend the event, watching the GMV figure skyrocket and hoping to get a glimpse of Alibaba founder Jack Ma.\n\nHowever, while Singles Day helps drum up excitement for Alibaba, the emphasis on growing the GMV can also create problems.\n\nConcerns about declining margins and the Chinese economy have contributed to Alibaba's stock declining 22% so far this year. As the company's showiest display of power, a subpar Singles Day would mean major issues for Alibaba.\n\n\"The whole world is looking at it \u2014 which puts a lot of pressure\" on Alibaba, said David Zipser, a McKinsey & Company senior partner who leads its consumer and retail practice in Greater China.\n\nBusiness Insider asked Alibaba executives over the weekend if Singles' Day growth was sustainable. Here are three reasons they insist the growth is far from over.\n\nTaking Singles Day offline\n\nAlibaba's Hema food delivery robot. Alibaba\n\nAlibaba's continuing growth is closely tied to the company entering new sectors. The company has entered markets including food delivery, entertainment, and grocery, with its chain Hema which is slated to hit 100 locations by the end of this year.\n\nMany of these new businesses are tied to Alibaba's plan to digitize traditionally offline markets, which the company calls \"New Retail.\" Currently, roughly 20% of Chinese retail sales take place online. That means there's another 80% of sales that Alibaba isn't really benefitting from \u2014 yet.\n\n\"It's really about digitizing the entire offline store environment,\" cofounder and executive vice chairman Joe Tsai told Business Insider. \"One of the biggest challenges with the traditional store environment is when someone walks into the store, they have no idea who the customer is \u2014 whether they picked up something or looked at another item.\"\n\nWith the rise of mobile, however, Alibaba can track shoppers basically at all times. Customers' reliance on their cell phones, as well as other technology, allows Alibaba to enter old-school shopping spaces and partner with more traditional retailers.\n\nTapping into the 80% of offline retail could be a significant Singles Day boost, depending on how Alibaba decides to measure New Retail sales. This year, offline sales \u2014 such as purchases at Hema \u2014 didn't count towards Singles' Day figures, despite the grocery chain offering 11/11 sales. Next year, president Michael Evans says Alibaba plans to make offline Singles Day figures more \"tangible.\"\n\n\"Consumers don't just stay home, browsing their mobile. They want to go out with their families, go to shopping malls, go to cinemas,\" CFO Chris Tung said.\n\nGoing global\n\nAlibaba's Singles' Day gala. Alibaba\n\nAlibaba has also continued to expand its business internationally, both with importing new brands into China and launching e-commerce operations in new regions. In 2018, Singapore-based shopping site Lazada \u2014 which Alibaba owns the majority of \u2014 hosted its own 11/11 sales for the first time, resulting in a tripling of shopper traffic.\n\n\"Everywhere I go, which is pretty much everywhere in the world, there are not very many people who do not know about 11/11,\" Evans told Business Insider.\n\n\"Many people ask the question \u2014 how can we participate next year? People are very interested, I think partly because they've heard of Black Friday and Cyber Monday and they think that's quite big.\"\n\nHe continued: \"They've heard of Amazon Prime Day. But, we sold as much in five minutes as Amazon sold in an entire Prime Day.\"\n\nTung says that next year is likely to be a \"more global\" experience. That could perhaps mean a different home base for 11/11 \u2014 maybe even one that isn't in China.\n\nThe old reliable: China's growing middle class\n\nAlibaba\n\nWhen all else fails, executives return to one group over and over again \u2014 China's growing middle class. Even if New Retail stumbles or international markets face speed bumps, executives say the growth of China' middle class will remain a constant driver.\n\n\"The exciting thing about the Chinese economy is that there is a core group of middle-class consumers, about 300 million,\" Tsai said. \"In 10 or 15 years, that is going to 600 million consumers. That is twice the size of the US population.\"\n\nThis middle class is curious and also hungry for new brands, Tsai says, especially imported Western brands. That hunger is key to making Singles Day work.\n\nIf the Chinese middle class maintains its growth, it would take a significant blunder for Singles Day sales to actually plummet. But when it comes to Singles Day figures skyrocketing, however, Alibaba seems to be looking somewhere new.\n\nInternational expansion can help keep things fresh. And, if Alibaba rejiggers how it counts New Retail numbers \u2014 as businesses that bridge on- and offline retail become increasingly important \u2014 the company has a chance to rewrite its Singles Day rules entirely.", "Snapchat is rolling out a new feature that will give users one-stop snapshots of each of their relationships with friends on the app, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nThese \"Friendship Profiles\" will include a full history of any photos, messages, and other content that you've saved in a chat with a Snapchat friend or a group.

So too is a child who has not only learned to read, but has developed a love for it. And FYI, the latter follows the former in lockstep: the more you read to your kids, the better readers they will be later in life.\n\nFinding great children's books is hardly a challenge. From Seuss, to Syd Hoff, to Margaret Wise Brown, there are countless classic kids' books that stand the test of time, while an ever-growing count of new children's books line up on library shelves each year. Often, the issue isn't the lack of great books for kids, but rather the glut of options that can be overwhelming to comb through as you choose what to read at bedtime any given night.\n\nWouldn't it be great if there was some unique book out there that would speak directly to your youngster? Some story so special it was almost like the book was written just for one kid? Good news, friend: there is. In fact, there is any number of these books, because the 15 titles offered by custom book publisher Wonderbly can be modified in multiple ways, creating a story tailored expressly for a single child.\n\nWonderbly is a perfect product of our moment. These days, most people feel they have less free time and seem to have less patience, yet we're also in an era where discerning customers demand quality out of their products and their service experience. Having gone through the process of creating three Wonderbly books so far, I can tell you they hit both of those targets right in the bull's eye. And the company makes perfect use of our era's technology, too.\n\nTo create a Wonderbly book, you simply click along through their easy-to-navigate site, selecting which title you want based on the recipient's gender, age (some books are geared toward kids 0-4, some are for 3-10, others 5-12, and so on), the occasion (birthday, Christmas, an adventure book because why not?), and you punch in a bit of information, often nothing more than the child's name, and for birthday books, their birth date.\n\nEach book features a protagonist, the image of which you can also choose. They offer three different characters in each gender, with each option sporting different hair colors and skin tones, so your intended recipient will definitely see themselves there in the story. And, once they realize that they are in fact the named main character, they will be thrilled.\n\nMost Wonderbly books cost between $22 and $30, with a handful of titles just below or above that range. That's a fine price to pay, if you ask me, for a book your child will love and that will contribute to that priceless love of books writ large.", "The entertainment world was sad to hear about the death of Stan Lee on Monday at the age of 95.

I still think about that.\"\n\nOn Monday, Stan posted this touching photo on his Instagram account of he and Lee, with a caption that read, \"Thank you great legend. You will be missed. I wouldn't be here without you.\"", "Oil prices fell for a 12th straight day Tuesday - the longest losing streak on record.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has recently pushed back against Saudi Arabia's plans to increase production.\n\nLast week, US production hit a record 11.6 million barrels per day.\n\nWatch oil trade live.\n\nOil prices fell for a 12th straight session Tuesday, the longest streak on record, after President Donald Trump pushed back against Saudi Arabia's plan to increase its output.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark, and Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, were both down by about 4.3%, at $56.36 and $65.92 a barrel.\n\n\"Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production,\" Trump tweeted on Monday. \"Oil prices should be much lower based on supply!\"\n\nLate Sunday, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid Al-Falih, told reporters in Abu Dhabi that the kingdom was going to reduce its oil production by about 500,000 barrels a day in December.\n\nOil prices have tumbled into a bear market - down at least 20% from their October peaks - amid concerns of growing stockpiles. Earlier in November, the Trump administration granted eight countries temporary waivers from the sanctions it placed against Iran that were designed to cut off its oil from the rest of the world.\n\nAnd data released last week by the Energy Information Agency showed US oil inventories climbed by 5.8 million barrels in the week to November 2, while production hit a weekly record of 11.6 million barrels per day.\n\nThe oil market had already been under pressure since the beginning of October as trade tensions and concerns over rising interest rates weighed.\n\nMarkets Insider", "Arlington, Virginia, was long considered a front-runner.

By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so! MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nWhile the two sides' connection became strained after Trump decided to apply tariffs to the European Union's steel and aluminum exports to the US, the falling out appears to have hit a nadir over the weekend.\n\nDefense dustup\n\nThe presidential dustup kicked off when Macron suggested last week that Europe needed to build up its military to protect itself from threats, including the US.\n\n\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia, and even the United States of America,\" Macron said on French radio.\n\nWhile Macron insisted the comment referred to the need to wean Europe off of the US's defense and cybersecurity apparatus, Trump took offense to the comment and bashed Macron in a tweet on Friday.\n\n\"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia,\" Trump said. \"Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the US subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nIn fact, Macron was essentially suggesting Europe do exactly what Trump wants: spend more on defense to meet the agreed-upon defense-spending threshold for NATO members.\n\nChristophe Petit Tesson/Pool via AP\n\nAn awkward weekend\n\nFollowing the back-and-forth over defense, Trump traveled to France to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, and his displeasure with Macron was on full display.\n\nThe trip got off to a shaky start Saturday when Trump did not attend a World War I memorial service near Paris on Saturday because of inclement weather; his absence drew a slew of critiques.\n\nTrump defended the choice in a tweet Tuesday, saying Marine One could not fly to the cemetary for the service and the Secret Service would not allow Trump to travel by car. While US presidents typically have backup plans in case of of foul weather, it appears Trump's team did not.\n\nThe awkwardness continued Sunday during a one-on-one meeting that did not appear as warm as previous interactions between Trump and Macron. The interaction was then followed by a Macron speech denouncing nationalism, a movement Trump has explicitly embraced in recent months.\n\n\"Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,\" Macron said just a few yards away from Trump. \"By saying, 'Our interests first, who cares about the others,' we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what gives it grace, and what is essential: its moral values.\"\n\nWhile Macron did not call out Trump by name, the US president did not appear to be enthused by the public condemnation.\n\nLashing out\n\nFollowing the rocky weekend, Trump continued to launch online attacks at France and the rest of the European leaders. On Monday, Trump threatened to pull out of NATO and declared on Twitter that \"Trade must be FREE and FAIR!\"\n\nTrump continued his tantrum on Tuesday with the personal attacks about Macron's approval ratings (which are indeed dismal) and a variety of other insults, including a shot at France's record during World War II.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump tweeted. \"But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the US came along. Pay for NATO or not!\"\n\nTrump and Macron with Melania Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Brigitte Macron. Benoit Tessier/Reuters\n\nThe president also attacked France's wine trade, saying trade restrictions imposed by the European Union were unfair to US wine producers.\n\n\"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the US,\" Trump said. \"The problem is that France makes it very hard for the US to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the US makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\"\n\nAccording to data from the International Trade Centre, France exported roughly $1.8 billion worth of wine to the US in 2017, while just $71 million went from the US to France.\n\nTrump reportedly has had a renewed interest in recent days in imposing tariffs on imported cars and trucks. While France wouldn't suffer from auto tariffs as much as other EU nations \u2014 such as Germany \u2014 the move would most likely cause major economic disruptions across Europe. France's finance minister has pledged to hit back if Trump imposes auto restrictions on European cars.\n\nA dwindling number of close relationships\n\nThe back-and-forth between Trump and Macron seems to have buried one of the president's closer diplomatic relationships.\n\nMacron was the first official state visitor of Trump's presidency, and the pair always shared a chummy rapport in their public interactions, but Trump appears to have been scorned of late. In fact, Macron appeared much closer to German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 who has not enjoyed a friendly relationship with Trump \u2014 over the weekend.\n\nThe collapse of the Trump-Macron bromance bears a lot of similarities to the falling out between the US leader and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nTrudeau and Trump seemed to forge a connection early in Trump's presidency, but feuds over trade policies and personal attacks by Trump caused an ugly breakup. Similarly, Trump's relationships with other leaders, like Chinese President Xi Jinping, have become strained over trade fights and other disagreements.\n\nBut Trump did share a warm greeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a memorial ceremony on Saturday, with Putin throwing Trump a big thumbs-up.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

The warrant automatically converts to stock in September at a price that gives WeWork a valuation of around $42 billion \u2014 provided the company doesn't go public or sell in the meantime.\n\nWeWork described the funding as \"opportunistic financing\" available to the company on attractive terms. Business Insider first reported in June that WeWork was in talks with SoftBank to raise further funding at a $35 billion valuation.\n\nAccording to third-quarter financials seen by Business Insider, WeWork has substantially increased its revenue but its losses have more than tripled.\n\nHere are the key numbers from WeWork's Q3 2018 financials:\n\nRevenue: $482.3 million, up from $241 million\n\nNet loss: $1.2 billion, from $322 million\n\nTotal revenue over the last 12 months: $1.5 billion.\n\n297,000 occupied desks out of an available 385,000.\n\nWeWork has played up its rapid expansion, with the office sharing firm now present across 83 cities and 24 countries. The firm has made its name by taking over large properties and doing them up in a bright style, then offering flexible co-working spaces ranging from hotdesking to private offices. It is increasingly using its massive cash pile to target bigger enterprise clients, and take on corporate makeovers on behalf of blue-chip firms, as it looks to more sustainable and diverse revenue streams. Enterprise clients now make up 29% of WeWork's user base, according to its investor deck.\n\nThe new funding from SoftBank comes after the firm invested in $1 billion in convertible debt in August. SoftBank and its technology investment fund the Vision Fund also invested $4.4 billion in WeWork in 2017.\n\nThe company said it had seen improved occupancy rates, a key metric for investors worried about tenants leaving after a short period and saddling WeWork with expensive lease commitments.

Draymond Green collected a rebound and pushed his way up the floor. Kevin Durant called for the ball, clapping his hands and jumping up and down as Green dribbled into traffic and had the ball stripped away.\n\nDurant immediately pivoted towards the bench and clapped his hands in frustration. When he sat down, he turned in Green's direction and appeared to shout \"Give me the ball. God damn!\"\n\nGreen \u2014 who is notoriously outspoken both on and off the court \u2014 yelled back at his teammate for the remainder of the break while Durant looked away and nodded his head dismissively. At a certain point, Thompson noticed the two jawing off and decided to sit between them on the bench.\n\nCheck out the full video of the heated exchange, which lasted for nearly three straight minutes:\n\nThe Warriors went on to lose 121-116 in overtime. Durant fouled out of the game on a controversial call with 3:46 left in overtime. Neither he nor Green were available to speak to the media after the game, with Durant storming out of the locker room before reporters even arrived.\n\nTeammate Shaun Livingston cast off the incident as expressions of \"team spirit\":\n\n\"Guys wanted a different outcome than what happened,\" Livingston said after the game, per ESPN's Nick Friedell. \"Obviously, [Green] had the turnover, guys might have thought they were open or wanted the basketball, didn't get it. Things happen like that in sports. But it was good to see some fire, some emotion.\"\n\nThis was far from the first time Durant and Green have clashed publicly. In January 2017, Golden State blew a 24-point lead against the Memphis Grizzlies and Green got in Durant's face on the court.\n\nA month later, the duo fought courtside after the Warriors lost to the Sacramento Kings. When a journalist asked about the altercation a few days later, Durant laughed and explained what had happened:\n\nWith Durant on the verge of free agency, much will be made of the scuffle. But before he can even think ahead to the summer, Durant will look to get Golden State back on track after losing two of its last three games.", "Five restaurants in New York City were recently awarded one of the highest honors in the industry: three coveted Michelin stars.\n\nThe Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare, Eleven Madison Park, Le Bernardin, Masa, and Per Se, all in Manhattan, topped the NYC guide for 2019.

My impostor syndrome kicked in, and I spent the days leading up to the interview riddled with self-doubt and fear.\n\nOn the morning of our call, I wrote about my fears in my journal. I explored every \"what if\" that was making me anxious, and then wrote about a rational reason why none of them wouldn't happen. What if I ask a stupid question?

According to the filing, HMNY \"does not expect to have the requisite stockholder votes to approve the proposed reverse stock split.\"\n\nHMNY wants to enact the split in order to try and get back into compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. But Business Insider talked to numerous investors over the past month who said they would not approve a reverse stock split, and some even took to social media to push a \"no\" vote.\n\nHMNY is trying desperately to stay on the Nasdaq, as it creeps closer to a potential delisting. If the stock, which was trading at around $0.02 Tuesday, stays below $1 after December 18, the process for delisting could begin.\n\nRead more: 18% of MoviePass subscribers say they plan to cancel, but many loyalists are still happy despite unpopular new features\n\nHMNY notes that the company may be given a second 180-calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, it would have to meet the listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and Nasdaq listing standards, except for the minimum bid price requirement.\n\n\"The Company would be required to notify the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC of its intent to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, which may include, if necessary, implementing a reverse stock split,\" the HMNY note says. \"If the Company is afforded additional time to regain compliance (of which there can be no assurance), the Board plans to call a special meeting as soon as practicable with a new record date for the Company's stockholders to vote on a reverse stock split in an effort to regain compliance.\"\n\nEven if HMNY gets approval for the reverse split, it might not help stabilize the stock. In August, HMNY's 1-for-250 reverse stock split shot the stock up before it crashed back down below $1 again.\n\nAnd if all this isn't enough for the company, HMNY also has a New York Attorney General's investigation hanging over its head.\n\nBusiness Insider contacted HMNY for comment but did not get a response.", "In the past few years, the role that pharmaceutical companies played in fueling the opioid crisis has started to come to light.\n\nThe New York Times unveiled in an investigative report in May that Purdue Pharma knew its opioid drugs were being abused in 1996, shortly after they came on the market. But the drugmaker concealed the information and continued to market its drugs until the early 2000s.\n\nOpioid overdoses caused more than 42,000 deaths in the US in 2016, and 40% of those deaths involved prescription drugs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The researchers, from the University of Pittsburgh, compared government data on overdose deaths with payments data collected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\n\"This is provocative data that can really serve as a substrate for us to do more work,\" said Dr. Benjamin Davies, one of the authors of the study and an associate professor of urology at the University of Pittsburgh School Of Medicine.\n\nIn 2016, the pharmaceutical industry doled out nearly $10 million to US physicians for opioid-related marketing. That includes speaking and consulting fees, meals, travel, honoraria, and education. As the researchers mapped the spending pattern against the map of opioid-related deaths, they found that the counties with the highest overdose death rate per capita also had the highest opioid-related industry payments, adjusted for population.\n\nThe study found that the top three counties with the highest concentration of opioid-related deaths were Harrison County in Kentucky and West Virginia's Cabell County and Wayne County.", "One of Tesla's most senior lawyers has left the automaker.

Kelly, Deputy Communications Chief of Staff William Shine, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the United States Secret Service, Secret Service Director Randolph Alles, and John Doe (the Secret Service agent that allegedly took Acosta's pass).\n\nThe statement also says the network decided to pursue action because \"If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials.\"\n\nSeveral instances of Trump's hits against CNN as \"Fake News\" on Twitter and in press conferences were listed in the complaint, which argued that the \"real reason\" Trump revoked Acosta's press pass was because he didn't like the network's coverage.\n\nRead more:Trump administration accused of behaving like authoritarian regime after revoking CNN reporter Jim Acosta's credentials and sharing suspicious video\n\nThe White House waved off the suit in a Tuesday morning statement, saying the network was \"grandstanding\" and the administration would \"vigorously defend\" against the complaint. The statement also suggested the administration was seeking to protect all reporters' access, saying Acosta's actions hindered an \"orderly and fair press conference\" and the decision to revoke the pass was a \"check on this behavior.\"\n\nThe decision came hours after a tense standoff between Acosta and President Donald Trump during a press conference that ended with the administration accusing Acosta of \"inappropriate behavior\" after a White House intern tried to grab a microphone out of his hand.\n\nNews of the suit was first suggested by former ABC White House correspondent Sam Donaldson, who told CNN \"Reliable Sources\" host Brian Stelter on Sunday that he had been asked to sign an affidavit for the lawsuit and that a court hearing was slated for Tuesday.\n\nIn response to an inquiry about Donaldson's comments, A CNN spokesperson told Business Insider: \"No decisions have been made.

This isn't necessarily a sign of weakness, however, as the staggeringly high numbers for Singles' Day are a huge base that make continued rapid growth difficult.\n\nAs an additional milestone, the number of delivery orders handled by Alibaba-owned Cainiao Smart Logistics Network topped 1 billion for the first time ever, beating last year's 812 million.\n\nThis year's Singles' Day placed special emphasis on offline efforts and international sales. The event marked the first year in which Singles' Day promotions came to Alibaba's RT-Mart stores, its Hema supermarket chain, its delivery service Ele.me, and its lifestyle platform Koubei, according to The Wall Street Journal. This demonstrates the e-tailer's push to provide a unified shopping ecosystem for its customers.\n\nAlibaba is also working to expand the shopping holiday internationally, as evidenced by Lazada, a Southeast Asian e-tailer and Alibaba subsidiary that held its own Singles' Day shopping festival in six markets.

The two locations \u2014 the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York, and the newly formed National Landing area of Arlington, Virginia \u2014 will each get roughly half of the 50,000 employees promised and half of the promised investment, the company said.\n\n\"We are excited to build new headquarters in New York City and Northern Virginia,\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. \"These two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come.

National Landing, which is a newly formed area encompassing Crystal City, Pentagon City, and Potomac Yard, is located near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport across the Potomac River from Washington, DC.\n\nSamantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nAmazon on Tuesday also announced plans for a new office in Nashville, Tennessee, where the company said it would hire 5,000 people and invest $230 million. Amazon is calling the new office an \"Operations Center of Excellence.\"\n\nAmazon said it could receive up to $102 million in tax incentives for its new office in downtown Nashville.\n\nThe official announcement follows a November 5 report from The New York Times that named New York and the Washington, DC, metro area as the choices for HQ2. That report followed a Wall Street Journal article that said Amazon was considering splitting the headquarters in two.\n\nAmazon on Tuesday said it would begin hiring for all three newly announced locations next year. The company has said it hopes to have at least part of its new headquarters operational sometime in 2019.\n\nThe selection process, conducted in secret, will now face public scrutiny for first time, as city and state officials who worked with Amazon were bound by strict nondisclosure agreements. The tax-incentive packages offered by New York and Virginia will especially be scrutinized.\n\nThe saga of HQ2 began in September 2017, when the company put out its official request for proposals by cities to host a new second headquarters.\n\nIn the request, Amazon promised 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment to the new host city. Nearly every major metro area in the US threw its hat in the ring. Amazon now has data on a huge number of American cities because of this process.\n\nAmazon whittled the list down to 20 locations by December but had barely made a peep about the selection process otherwise.\n\nRead more: 'We do have sewage problems': Long Island City, where Amazon will put part of HQ2, badly needs infrastructure upgrades\n\nSelecting two cities is something of a curveball because it was not originally part of the plan Amazon had proposed for HQ2. A small note at the bottom of Amazon's RFP did, however, hint at it as possibility.\n\n\"Amazon may select one or more proposals and negotiate with the parties submitting such proposals before making an award decision, or it may select no proposals and enter into no agreement,\" the last line of the RFP said.\n\nThe evidence had long been pointing toward the Washington, DC, metro area, which had submitted three separate regions for consideration. Amazon joined Washington's chamber of commerce in August. Add to that the fact that Amazon already had its public-policy and lobbying operations in the district, and the US capital seemed like a shoo-in.\n\nIn recent months, the betting odds quite literally zeroed in on Northern Virginia. The region is in what has been referred to as the \"bull's-eye of America's internet,\" adding to its chances. A local news site, ARLnow.com, said it had seen an unusual spike in traffic from Amazon to an article from December titled \"County Wins Top Environmental Award from US Green Building Council,\" which explained how Virginia's Arlington County was the first in the US to be selected for an environmental award.\n\nThere had been less speculation about New York City, but Gov.

But if you ask Miyashiro to explain what exactly 88Rising is, as I did recently, he tends to chuckle.\n\n\"Damn. It's funny because I always answer this different,\" Miyashiro told me. It's as if he knows his company is a Rorschach test for the media, his investors, and its fans.\n\n\"We're really focused on creating superstars and creating heroes and creating something that people can really believe in and be excited about.

While its biggest names don't yet rival name-brand artists like Taylor Swift or Justin Bieber, they have dedicated followings and a certain cachet with connected Gen Zers.\n\nThe biggest of the bunch include Brian Imanuel, a 19-year-old rapper and beatmaker who goes by the name Rich Brian; George Miller, a Japanese-born R&B singer who got his start as a YouTube star making outrageous comedy videos before turning to music full time under the moniker Joji; and the Higher Brothers, a quartet of rappers from Chengdu, China, who make high-energy, bouncy tunes about modern Chinese life, like the group's 2017 single \"WeChat,\" about the titular Chinese messaging app.\n\nWhen Miyashiro has been asked to explain it, he's likened his company to a future Vice and Disney. It'd be easy to write off Miyashiro as having delusions of grandeur, but 88Rising and its fans are the kind of thing you need to see in action to really understand.\n\n88Rising and its founder, Sean Miyashiro, have their fingers on the pulse\n\nMiyashiro backstage with members of the Higher Brothers, a Chinese hip-hop group. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nOn a warm September night, Miyashiro invited me to attend the New York date of the company's 88 Degrees & Rising Tour.\n\nThe 21-date road show comes on the heels of 88Rising's inaugural Head in the Clouds music festival in Los Angeles, which brought together the company's complete artist lineup, featuring artists from Indonesia, Korea, China, and LA, for the first time.\n\nHeld at Pier 17, a swanky rooftop at the southern tip of Manhattan, the concert started slow as the streetwear-clad attendees filed in and 88Rising's newest artists ran through abbreviated set lists.\n\nThose early sets, like much of 88Rising's oeuvre, have a DIY quality. Like the first generation of YouTube stars, the artists feel talented, but unstudied and rough around the edges. The artists alternate between bleeding their hearts with unvarnished honesty and making the next irony-laden meme-inspired joke. In a way, each artist's persona seems designed, intentionally or not, to make teenagers feel like they could be one of them.\n\nIn recent dates on the 88 Degrees and Rising Tour, Joji has taken to juggling between songs.\n\nSinger August 08 performs at the 88 Degrees & Rising Tour show in New York. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nDuring his set, August 08 \u2014 an LA-based African-American singer who traffics in melodic and atmospheric R&B \u2014 stops the music to egg on the crowd. \"Everybody yell 'F--k!'\" he shouted mischievously. \"F--k, f--k, f--k, f--k!\"\n\nAt one point, he stops mid-song and directs the crowd to look at the sunset. \"Everybody look at that skyline. It's beautiful, man.\"\n\nAt first I can't tell if he's trolling the crowd, but then everyone turns toward the Hudson River. The sunset is gorgeous, with pink, purple, and orange cotton-candy clouds.\n\nDownstairs, in the green room, August introduced himself shyly before complaining that he wasn't sure the crowd was feeling the set. He, like the rest of the 88Rising crew, is earnest in person. A few minutes later, Rich Brian, Joji, and others in 88Rising's orbit debated the merits of Brockhampton, another of-the-moment hip-hop collective.\n\nArtists Joji, right, and Rich Brian hang with members of the 88Rising team. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nMeanwhile, Miyashiro was in another room finishing up an interview with Vice. The budding mogul is nothing if not savvy. In the last year, he's scored glowing features in Bloomberg, The New Yorker, and CNN.\n\nAfter the interview wraps up, he starts talking shop with me. Wearing a rolled cuff skullcap pulled back over messy hair, a wispy beard, and a flamboyantly patterned button-down, Miyashiro has a mind that never seems to stray too far from work. Within minutes, he's asking me if I shoot video, telling me Business Insider's feature on 88Rising would work really well as a video, and offering pointers to Vice's videographers on where they might get the best shots for the segment they're producing. The funny part is, he's totally right.\n\nMiyashiro is prone, like his artists, to switch rapidly between impish trolling and wide-eyed earnestness. In the elevator up to the rooftop concert, I ask him about Thump, the now defunct electronic music site he cocreated at Vice, he looks at me deadpan and says, \"What's Thump?\" He holds it for a moment before he starts cracking up: \"I'm just f----ing with you, man.\"\n\nFans at the 88 Degrees & Rising Tour show in New York.

Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nIt's clear Miyashiro understands the digital-media game better than most \u2014 its need for headlines, hooks, and, above all, content \u2014 and he knows it.\n\nTo Miyashiro's mind, 88Rising has four parts to its business: a digital-media and video-production business, a music label, a burgeoning arm looking into film and TV opportunities, and a \"cultural agency business\" working with like-minded brands.\n\nWhen describing his strategy for helping Chinese megastar Kris Wu break into American hip-hop, Miyashiro told The New Yorker he discouraged Wu from appearing on \"Good Morning America.\" The morning show's 4 million viewers aren't who Wu needs. Miyashiro told Wu he needs the audiences who read hip-hop magazines like XXL and Complex and listens to Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats 1.\n\nLater, when I ask him where the idea for 88Rising started, he again turns to deadpan: \"The idea started in my brain. Like, I was just chilling and I was, like, 'I wanna do that.'\" But then he pauses, as if recognizing that he needs to be earnest again.\n\n\"The whole genesis of 88Rising came from me and my friends hanging out,\" Miyashiro said. \"I was fortunate enough to hang out with a lot of different creators and people doing cool things that happened to be Asian. They were all leaders in their respective fields, whether it was graphic design or acting or music.\n\n\"And I just thought that \u2026 if we all tried to combine [our skills] and do something with a real, concerted effort, it was gonna be something that's better than nothing because nothing existed.\"\n\nEarly on, Miyashiro figured out how to turn viral hits into a career\n\nThe 88Rising offices in Manhattan, New York.

His initial incarnation of the company was a DIY management firm called CXSHXNLY that he started in 2015 from the roof of a Bronx parking garage.\n\nHe would trawl the internet looking for up-and-coming rappers from Asia. Miyashiro's first client was Jonathan Park, a Korean-American rapper who goes by the name Dumbfoundead.\n\nHis first big success came when Park showed him the video for the 2015 hit \"IT G MA,\" by Lee Dongheon, a South Korean rapper who goes by the name Keith Ape. Miyashiro and Park persuaded Ape to come to the US for the South by Southwest talent showcase in Austin, Texas. Miyashiro then persuaded Lee to become a client.\n\nShortly after, Miyashiro contacted Taiwanese-American music producer Josh Pan to create a remix of \"IT G MA\" with Waka Flocka, A$AP Ferg, Father, and Dumfoundead. The remix reportedly cost him less than $10,000 to pull off. It and the SXSW performance launched Ape's US stardom.\n\nMiyashiro's stewardship of Ape's career speaks to how 88Rising, even in its prototype stage, has positioned itself as different from the rest of the music industry and \u2014 if Miyashiro's ambitions are realized \u2014 Hollywood too. Miyashiro didn't simply release a new song for Ape; he strategically directed Ape's entire entrance into the culture, from his media appearances and his early shows to his artistic direction. It was a creative, hands-on approach to get his artist the right looks from the right people.\n\n\"Our label exists because no major label or distributor or American music company's gonna know what to do with something like this,\" Miyashiro said. \"We're the only ones who are gonna know and it's not easy.\"\n\nJapanese hip-hop artist KOHH performs at Fans at the 88 Degrees & Rising Tour show. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nJapanese hip-hop artist KOHH performs at Fans at the 88 Degrees & Rising Tour. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nMiyashiro pulled a similar feat with Rich Brian.\n\nIn 2016, Rich Brian was 16 and going by the problematic moniker Rich Chigga, a portmanteau of Chinese and the N-word. He independently released the rap song \"Dat $tick.\" The accompanying video features the young Indonesian rapping hip-hop tropes like gunplay and fancy cars in his shockingly deep baritone as he struts in a pink polo shirt and fanny pack. The video went viral \u2014 it currently has 105 million views \u2014 likely because of the transgressive incongruity between Brian's appearance, his voice, and his lyrics, and the spectacle of seeing hip-hop distorted in his irreverent and foreign lens. But it also courted controversy for Brian's use of the N-word, his rap name, and, in some eyes, his cultural appropriation.\n\nMiyashiro's response was to bring together a number of up-and-coming and established hip-hop artists to film a series of videos at South by Southwest. The most successful of the bunch featured the artists reacting to \"Dat $tick\" and Rich Brian as they watched the video live. Among others, Cam'ron, 21Savage, the Flatbush Zombies, and Ghostface Killah feature in the video, which has more than 18 million views. For the most part, the artists respond positively, if incredulously, to Brian's style and flow.\n\nLater that year, Ghostface Killah recorded a remix of the track. It has more than 13 million views in its own right.\n\nThe video was a savvy move. By putting the question of \"Dat $tick\" directly to hip-hop's artists, Miyashiro recontextualized the conversation around Brian's cultural appropriation and get him rubber-stamped as an artist who could be taken seriously.\n\nBrian dropped the Rich Chigga moniker in favor of Rich Brian at the beginning of this year, shortly before releasing his debut album \"Amen.\" The album, for the most part, eschews the gangster-rap and trap cosplay for songs both autobiographical and introspective about what it's like to live Brian's strange life. He began as an outcast and an introvert using Twitter and Vine as an outlet for his sometimes offensive humor before producing his own music and hip-hop.\n\nMiyashiro maintained that Brian came to the decision to pursue more personal music on his own, adding that 88Rising's artists are self-directed when it comes to their art. But it seems likely that Miyashiro \u2014 and by extension Brian \u2014 were influenced by the internet conversations around cultural appropriation. Other 88Rising artists have drawn similar criticism.\n\n\"He hasn't done anything remotely similar since. He's grown as a person and as an artist, and now has a much more global point of view,\" Miyashiro said of \"Dat $tick\" and Rich Brian. \"None of our artists are talking about anything that they don't do.\"\n\n88Rising's big sell is that it can bring new brands to its audience and new audiences to its brand\n\nThe 88 Degrees & Rising Tour show in New York. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nWhat makes 88Rising unique, aside from its focus on Asian stars and entertainment, is its business model.\n\nWhile Miyashiro started his career with a number of music-related jobs, he made his first real mark at Vice. In 2013, electronic dance music was blowing up and he, along with several friends who managed EDM acts, persuaded Vice to let them set up a new media platform dedicated to the genre. By covering dance music and nightlife from an insider's perspective, Thump quickly gained the respect of both established and up-and-coming artists and a dedicated following among the larger underground dance-music culture.\n\nMiyashiro helped build Thump from the ground up. He said the experience helped shape his blueprint for how to launch a media property. Tom Punch, Vice's chief commercial and creative director, told Bloomberg that Miyashiro had a talent for pulling in advertisers, like Anheuser-Busch InBev, that wanted to capitalize on the EDM boom.\n\nIt's easy to see the parallels between 88Rising and Vice. Miyashiro doesn't shy away from them.\n\n\"There are a lot of differences from our business to theirs, but the one core aspect that might be similar is that Vice has an incredibly strong brand,\" Miyashiro said. \"They've been able to take that brand and what it stands \u2026 and they've been able to expand their brand into all these different opportunities.\"\n\nAs of right now, the music label is the most fully fledged and well known, thanks to Rich Brian, Joji, and the rest of 88Rising's roster. But it's hard not to think that it's Miyashiro's keen eye for working with big brands that persuaded global advertising firm WPP to invest a reported $4.5 million of a total $7 million that the company has raised so far.\n\nIn January, the company worked with the ad agency Ogilvy to come up with the concept for a Sprite commercial in China featuring MaSiWei, one of the members of Higher Brothers. The ad, which began airing just before the Lunar New Year, China's biggest holiday, features MaSiWei visiting his family for the holidays. The family asks him the usual prying questions about his girlfriend and his salary, which MaSiWei deflects with an ice-cold Sprite and rhymes from his single \"Refresh,\" the video for which also doubles as a Sprite commercial.\n\n\"We were actually pitching against all of these legacy agencies in the market that have been there forever and we won,\" Miyashiro said. \"We've never even made a television commercial before.\"\n\nThe ad and the song are the kind of intermingling of editorial and advertising that brands crave and Vice has often been criticized for. But whereas Vice must adhere to the standards of a news organization, 88Rising has no such obligations. It's an entertainment company committed to raising the profile of its artists and its own brand. The symbiotic leveraging of brands \u2014 using big-name ones to introduce 88Rising and its artists to more people and the use of 88Rising's brand to confer street cred on those brands \u2014 is the point.\n\nIt's more or less what Miyashiro has already done in music, partnering with the hip-hop press-approved artists that have been featured on 88Rising's songs. Playboi Carti, Ghostface Killah, Famous Dex, and Wacka Flocka Flame \u2014 all of whom have been featured in 88Rising songs or remixes \u2014 give 88Rising's artists credibility while 88Rising introduces those artists to its fan base.\n\nThough the ad was successful, Miyashiro maintains that, nine months later, 88Rising is onto the next evolution of its business model. Whereas the Sprite commercial came out of a standard ad-industry process \u2014 brand produces brief, creative teams pitch ideas, brand selects winner \u2014 Miyashiro is after what he calls \"true partnerships.\" Miyashiro doesn't want 88Rising to be subject to selling ad impressions against its audience or erecting content paywalls, like most digital-media companies, or responding to briefs like an advertising firm.\n\nMembers of the Higher Brothers, a Chinese hip-hop group perform at the 88 Degrees & Rising Tour show in New York.

Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nInstead, he wants 88Rising to create projects that, by virtue of their premium nature, brands simply want to help fund and be associated with.\n\n\"When we get into any type of brand conversation or any type of partnership conversation, we already have the ideas for things that we, as 88Rising, want to make,\" Miyashiro said. \"We're not looking to ask [brands] what they want and then make it for them.\"\n\nThe first fruit of this approach is 88Rising's upcoming collaboration with the clothing brand Guess, which dropped on November 8. The 14-piece collection features clothing pieces costing up to $148 and all designed in colorful, psychedelic tie-dye, a nod to the company's recent compilation album, \"Head in the Clouds.\" 88Rising said the collection sold out in 20 minutes.\n\nGuess has a long history in hip-hop. Last year it worked with rapper and fashion icon A$AP Rocky on a clothing line. But, Miyashiro said, this is the first time Guess has collaborated with an Asian company.\n\nMiyashiro maintains that the collaboration came out of creatives at 88Rising and those at Guess wanting to work together, not Guess asking them how to enter the Asian market.\n\n\"It's more like we're going to come together and our brand is going to be amplified through this and their brand is going to be amplified through this,\" Miyashiro said. \"When this comes out, this is another thing that elevates us.\"\n\nAt the concert in New York, the 88Rising employees I met were already dressed in Guess x 88Rising T-shirts. The S's are turned into 88s with an the company's signature arrow. It's likely only a matter of time before 88Rising's artists are decked out in the swag too.\n\n88Rising is already looking to get to the next level\n\n88Rising's offices in Manhattan. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nThis year 88Rising nearly doubled in size, from 24 to 45 employees, and has opened new offices in Los Angeles and Shanghai. But as I visited its headquarters in Chelsea, it feels like 88Rising is notable for what it could be rather than what it is. And right now that's a scrappy young company and CEO making it up as they go.\n\nThe way Miyashiro talks, I'd be forgiven for imagining the company's headquarters akin to Vice's now famous swanky Williamsburg hipster warehouse. In reality, it's a workmanlike room with exposed brick walls on the fourth floor of a doormanless building that holds maybe a dozen or so people crowded around laptops and iMacs where video editors cut the brand's latest YouTube videos.\n\nMiyashiro's office is in the back. Decorated with a glass table, a velvet sofa, and large neon sign featuring an 88 and the Chinese character for \"rising,\" it appears to double as a conference room. Framed album covers of 88Rising's artists hang on the walls.\n\nAs we wait to start the interview, Miyashiro seems a bit self-conscious about the office's startup-standard wood tables and chairs and starts quizzing one of his employees about when she could upgrade the furniture to something more \"dope.\"\n\n88Rising's offices in Manhattan. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nMiyashiro's eyes always seem set on the next evolution of his vision.\n\n\"You might look at us right now and say, 'Hey, 88Rising is the leading Asian label. They have a great collective,' Miyashiro said. \"But in a year or two from now, we'd like to have films that have been made and brought to the world \u2026 Three years from now, we might have our own TV channel.\"\n\nGetting to that point will largely rely on 88Rising's artists continuing to execute and Miyashiro and his team continuing to find ways to get its audience hooked on new artists. In a lot of ways, the team had it easy with 88Rising's first generation of artists. Before Miyashiro began working with them, Keith Ape had already come out with his career-making single \"IT G MA\"; Rich Brian had already gone viral with \"Dat $tick\"; and Joji was already a bona fide star on YouTube, albeit for his comedic antics. He invented the \"Harlem Shake\" meme when three costumed friends danced along to the Baauer hit.\n\nWith artists like Indonesian singer Niki and August 08, the company's first African-American artist, Miyashiro is more or less starting from scratch. And that's before you get into the difficulty of getting an Asian-led film or TV show made in Hollywood, with or without the box-office success of \"Crazy Rich Asians.\" But none of that scares Miyashiro.\n\n\"We like doing things that nobody else has done before,\" Miyashiro said. \"We want to be a part of that conversation.\"", "AP/Jae C. Hong\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday took aim at France's trade practices surrounding its wine industry.\n\nHe said the country charged \"big tariffs\" compared with the \"very small tariffs\" the US placed on French wine.\n\nTrump's relationship with French President Emmanuel Macron has been deteriorating in recent weeks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday railed against what he framed as unfair trade practices by France when it comes to wine.\n\n\"On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S.,\" Trump tweeted. \"The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!\"\n\nThe European Union levies tariffs ranging from $0.11 to $0.29 a bottle on wine that is imported from the US, while bottles exported from the EU to the US are hit with a tax of $0.05 a bottle, the Wine Institute says. Data specific to France was not readily available.\n\nIn 2017, the US imported $1.8 billion worth of French wine, while France bought just $71 million worth of US wine, according to data from the International Trade Centre. The US is the largest destination for French wine, making up 17% of the country's exports, according to the data.\n\nTrump's tweet comes amid a deteriorating relationship between him and French President Emmanuel Macron. Earlier Tuesday, Trump took aim at France's war record in response to Macron last week suggesting Europe needed an army to \"protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia, and even the United States of America.\"\n\nMacron later clarified his comments to say they were directed at cybercrime and building domestic defense industries that didn't rely on US arms.\n\n\"Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday. \"But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France?

Their whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nTheir friends and associates told Reuters this was likely a coordinated effort to silence their campaign.\n\nThe student activists have been demonstrating in support for workers' rights in China. Their campaign started this summer when they protested against factory workers who were fired and arrested for trying to form a labor union. Here is one of the protests in August.

Additionally, while China's communist party retains the central government and economic planning of Marxist governments, it's widely embraced capitalism and private enterprise.\n\nThis opposition to grassroots organizations extends to labor activists and independent unions.\n\nStudent activists pictured in an apartment on Thursday, August 23.

The collaborative effort, developed with technology partners Anquan, Deloitte, and Nasdaq, marks the latest phase of MAS' Project Ubin initiative, aimed at investigating how distributed ledger technology (DLT) can be utilized in the clearing and settlement of payment and securities.\n\nThe successful trial suggests that an overhaul of traditional financial networks is getting closer. DvP settlement processes involve the simultaneous exchange of securities and monies to guarantee that the delivery of securities occurs only when the payment linked to the securities is made.\n\nTypically, this settlement procedure requires the use of electronic ledgers to track and update records of transactions. However, these processes can be slow and inefficient, as they often rely on manual input. This also increases costs and opens up the possibility of fraud and hacks. MAS and SGX's breakthrough enables FIs to carry out these processes simultaneously, with the transaction obligations recorded on a shared ledger.\n\nBy opening up the possibility of performing these processes simultaneously, the blockchain-based DvP mechanism is able to improve operational efficiency and reduce settlement risks, the two parties said.\n\nMAS' involvement could increase the adoption of blockchain for settlement processes. This isn't the first time we've seen blockchain being applied to traditional financial market processes: 75% of financial market infrastructure operators are either using DLT already or working on pilots using the technology, according to Financial Times citing Nasdaq and Celent data.\n\nHowever, while the technology offers promise, a number of practical hurdles have impeded developments. For instance, regulatory and legal challenges have tapered the development of Bank of Canada's phase 3 of Project Jasper, which aims to use blockchain for DvP processes. Given MAS is Singapore's financial watchdog, regulatory challenges to facilitate a move to DLT in the city-state appear to be much less problematic.\n\nThis could allow Singapore to move ahead of other financial centers in blockchain innovation. Regulators worldwide would be wise to keep tabs on such developments, as they highlight the potential role played by authorities in fueling innovation in financial markets.", "LONDON \u2014 Is Theresa May about to agree a Brexit deal?\n\nThere are whispers in Westminster and Brussels this evening that a deal could be on, with the main stumbling-block to an agreement \u2014 the Northern Ireland \"backstop\" now largely agreed by EU negotiators, according to reports.\n\nIt marks a turnaround from Monday, when Downing Street sources Business Insider spoke to were downbeat, suggesting that a deal was unlikely to be done in time for the EU's deadline to organise a November Brexit summit.\n\n\"I wouldn't go getting your hopes up,\" one senior government source told BI after a weekend of negotiations failed to get a breakthrough.\n\nHowever, after two long days of negotiations on Sunday and Monday, which extended into the early hours of the morning, there is some optimism in Downing Street that a deal could be brokered within the next 24 hours.\n\n\"There won't be a deal today but we're pushing hard to get it over the line tomorrow,\" a Whitehall source told BI.\n\nIf there is a deal then it must be done by the end of play on Wednesday in order to meet the deadline for a November Brexit summit. Downing Street believes that significant progress has been made over the past 48 hours towards meeting that deadline.\n\nFailure to meet that deadline would mean a deal cannot be finalised until December.

That means that an emergency meeting would have to be called on Wednesday, before any deal can be done.\n\nIf you see Cabinet ministers strolling into Downing Street en masse tomorrow morning then you will know a deal is on.\n\nSo will May get ministers on side?\n\nThe experience from previous such crunch points in this process is that, despite threats to the contrary, it is likely that the majority of ministers will ultimately wave the deal through, give or take a couple of potential resignations.\n\nHowever, the real challenge will then become whether May can get that deal through parliament.\n\nAll the signs at the moment suggest that the prime minister simply doesn't have the numbers.

El Chapo's lawyers said the hug was necessary for his mental health.\n\nDue to the level of public interest and El Chapo's reputation as a Cartel leader, Cogan has called the case \"unprecedented.\"\n\nOpening statements by prosecutors and defendants will be read at the Eastern District court in front of the judge at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, court records show, and the case could last for four months.\n\nEl Chapo pleaded not guilty in January 2017 to all counts.", "Goldman Sachs analysts have slashed their iPhone unit sales estimate by 6% and downgraded their price target after Lumentum, which makes a part needed for Apple's Face ID camera on the new iPhones, said that a major customer, believed to be Apple, had drastically cut its order.\n\n\"To account for this new information, we are reducing our iPhone XR/XS Max/XS units estimate, while increasing estimates of lower priced iPhone units,\" the Goldman analysts wrote in a note distributed on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are concerned that end demand for new iPhone models is deteriorating,\" the analysts continued. \"We note this could easily right itself given the bulk of demand comes in late December but we feel more prudent sell through forecasts are warranted due to the timing and magnitude of this warning.\"\n\nThe note comes days after several reports came to similar conclusions.\n\nJPMorgan analysts said iPhone unit sales could decline on an annual basis in both 2018 and 2019 due to weak demand in emerging markets.

Goldman's report is the latest evidence that analysts are now worried iPhone unit sales are going to start shrinking in the short-term, which is believed to be the reason why Apple decided to stop reporting the key metric.

And the explanation is far from clear.\n\n\"The issuance of the detailed regulations for implementation has been postponed after study,\" Ding Xuedong, a recently-appointed deputy secretary-general at China's State Council, told the state-run Xinhua news agency on Monday, in an interview translated on China.org.\n\nHe added that the council would allow for the regulated use of tiger and rhino parts for scientific research, sales of cultural relics, and medical research or in healing.\n\nIn other words, the policy change is not a full 180-degree pivot, but more of a bureaucratic holding pattern following unanticipated popular blowback.\n\nRhino horns displayed at the Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok in March 2017. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nThe unexpected October circular seemed to walk back on China's recent and historic commitments to wildlife protection. Only last year China placed a long-awaited ban on the trade in ivory, extending a much-needed lifeline to endangered species.\n\nPerhaps following the widely-lambasted decision to lift rhino and tiger trade last month, Ding on Monday told Xinhua that China would continue to enforce its \"three strict bans\" on the trade, transport, and use of rhino and tiger products.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Relevant departments of the Chinese government will soon continue to organize special crackdown campaigns with focus on addressing the illegal trade of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts.\n\n\"Once again, I would like to reiterate that the Chinese government is willing to work with the international community to jointly strive for protecting wildlife and building our harmonious and beautiful planet.\"\n\nDing went on to vow that any illegal acts will be \"dealt with severely.\"\n\nChina prohibited the trade of rhino horn and tiger bones in 1993, but perhaps as a consequence the price for rhino horn began to edge higher and peaked a few years ago at around$65,000 per kilogram.\n\nA product made with ivory from endangered animals, as can be seen in a 2012 video by CNBC.

After getting a new SIM card for free from my carrier, I popped it into the iPhone 8, and it's been my companion for the past month.\n\nIt turns out, I sort of like it more than my iPhone X. In fact, I've been debating what phone to get to replace my lost iPhone X, and I might decide not to buy this year's new models \u2014 the iPhone XS and iPhone XR \u2014 and get an iPhone 8, which was released in 2017 and has the same basic design as iPhones released in 2014.\n\nIt appears that the market may be saying the same thing.

And my life was in shambles, okay? Figuratively speaking and literally. I was actually married, and living in Hawaii.\n\n[Hi everybody, aloha, thanks for watching.]\n\nBecause I was in the reserves, it also meant that I had a lot of free time to do other things, so I was, you know, living on this island, and not really happily married, and I kind of was just like looking for like an outlet creatively, and just something to like take my mind off of how unhappy I was at the time. And I discovered YouTube, but at the time, it was more like, oh my God, like I would just binge watch videos.\n\nAnd then my best friend every day would literally be like, \"Why don't you just start a YouTube channel?\" And I was like, \"Nope, not interested, nope, not interested, nope,\" I shot her down like so many times. And finally, I was like, \"Guess I don't really have that much free time for anything else, so I might as well just start a YouTube channel.\" So that's literally what I did.\n\n[I've numbered every color you could imagine.]\n\nIt eventually got to a point where I was like, \"Okay, what's it gonna be, you know, I'm not quite stable here yet, but I really feel like something's gonna pop off, so I gotta decide right now, what's it gonna be?\" And I just didn't wanna take the risk though, 'cause once you re-enlist, it's like, what am I gonna say to my first sergeant, like, \"First sergeant, Google's calling me,\" like, you know, he's gonna be like, \"Bye, get out my office.\"\n\nAnd so I decided to walk away because these careers were both kind of growing at the same time, but one started to take off a lot faster than the other.

I think that it taught me how to set a goal and, like, smash it, like a lot of people didn't think that I would be able to make it in the military. A lot of people like, laughed at me, they were like, \"What the heck are you doing?\" I didn't come from like, a military family or anything, so I was really like kind of one of the first people in my family to really do something that was like, not normal, and so I set a goal and like, I just needed a change at that time in my life, and I did it.\n\nI think it's also taught me to be extremely grateful and to not complain about stuff. There's so many things I don't complain about, 'cause I'm just like, I could be in heels or I could be back in boots. So what's the real tea, so there's a lot that I'm just like, not gonna complain, not gonna complain.\n\nAnd, yeah, I feel like it aged me a couple more years, like, everyone's like, \"You've been married, you went in the military?

In many of those suits, she said, people died because of a simple and avoidable medication error, where a clinician had accidentally given a patient the wrong liquid opioid.\n\n\"The problem is, morphine looks like fentanyl looks like dilaudid,\" Palmer told Business Insider. \"They all look the same.\"\n\nAn anesthesiologist by training, Palmer created a new formulation of an opioid, called Dsuvia, explicitly to avoid these kinds of accidental deaths.\n\nThe drug was approved by by the Food and Drug Administration on November 2. It's a tiny blue tablet, packaged in a special single-use applicator, that dissolves under the tongue and begins working to relieve pain in under an hour.\n\n\"It dawned on me \u2014 what if we could design an oral form of these drugs that worked as quickly as the liquid, but basically you weren't one step away from being killed by a tired nurse or a doctor who ordered the wrong drug,\" Palmer said. \"You could have almost a fool-proof way of treating someone.\"\n\nIn addition, Palmer said the new drug would help patients whose pain can't be treated efficiently with an IV or an injection, such as soldiers on the battlefield or patients whose veins are difficult to find.\n\nIn a statement announcing the new drug's approval, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb echoed this reasoning. He also said the Pentagon had \"worked closely\" with Palmer's company to develop the drug for use on the battlefield, where it would fill what he called a \"specific and important, but limited, unmet medical need.\"\n\nMany emergency room doctors appear to disagree with the need for yet another opioid, however.\n\nWhile some of them aren't necessarily opposed to the approval of a new opioid (thousands of patients need them, even as thousands more are dying from addiction), many of them say Dsuvia aims to solve a set of problems that doesn't exist \u2014 at least not at the magnitude in which Palmer presented it.\n\nMore importantly, the experts said, there are easier and simpler ways to prevent mistakes and help make sure that doctors are giving patients the right dose of pain relievers.\n\nDsuvia is 'not a game-changer'\n\nDozens of potent opioid painkillers already exist. Shayanne Gal/Business Insider One of the critics is Raeford Brown, an anesthesiologist at the University of Kentucky and the chair of the FDA advisory committee that voted in favor of the drug while he was absent. Brown, who also leads a consumer advocacy group called Public Citizen, told NPR that he was not present for the vote because of a scheduling conflict.\n\n\"We have worked very diligently over the last three or four years to try to improve the public health, to reduce the number of potent opioids on the street,\" Brown told NPR. \"I don't think this is going to help us in any way.\"\n\nDsuvia is a different formulation of an already available drug called sufentanil, which is used as an anesthetic for surgeries and other invasive medical procedures. While sufentanil must be injected or delivered via an IV, Dsuvia can be taken orally.\n\n\"We've taken a wonderful old drug and delivered it in a way that's user-friendly. An ER doctor could never have used it before,\" Palmer said.\n\nYet because so many other opioids already exist, Dsuvia is unnecessary, several physicians said. The benefits of a single-use package, and of a new way of giving the painkiller, aren't particularly significant, they said.\n\n\"I agree that patients need to be treated for pain, but I don't think this solves that problem except maybe in a very incremental way,\" Jeremy Samuel Faust, an attending physician in the department of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and an instructor at Harvard Medical School, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's not a game-changer,\" he added.\n\n'Like engineering overkill'\n\nAcelRx Because of the wide range of available opioids and the frequency with which they are given, medical dosing errors do happen. Dosing errors include situations where the wrong type or dose of medication is given to a patient and they're either under-treated for their pain or given too much medication, potentially injuring or killing them.\n\nGood data on just how frequent these errors are and how often they harm or even kill patients is lacking. A 2012 report authored by the nonprofit healthcare accreditation organization the Joint Commission suggested that while the errors were common, they could not determine how frequently they were fatal.\n\n\"Of the opioid-related adverse drug events \u2014 including deaths \u2014 that occurred in hospitals and were reported to The Joint Commission's Sentinel Event database (2004-2011), 47% were wrong dose medication errors,\" the report read.\n\nIf the main problem with current opioids is that they are easily mixed up, physicians say there are much simpler solutions than introducing a more potent oral opioid.\n\n\"If the real concern is the wrong bottle, why not color-code the bottles?\" asked Ernest Rasyidi, a psychiatrist in the emergency clinician decision unit at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, California.\n\n\"There are plenty of low-cost solutions out there if this is a systems problem,\" Rasyidi said. \"But this would be a very complicated and round-about way of solving that issue. It's like engineering overkill.\"\n\nFaust agreed.\n\n\"Medication errors are a problem but I wouldn't say that the solution is adding another medication that's packaged differently. Why not better labeling?\"\n\nBut Palmer believes Dsuvia solves a problem that isn't currently being addressed.\n\n\"The future is Dsuvia. It's not starting an IV and giving a liquid that even has the remotest possibility of being confused for another drug,\" she said.\n\nShe compared the need for new and better opioids to the car industry.\n\n\"They're dangerous but they're necessary,\" Palmer said.\n\n\"When you have something dangerous but necessary, you have to innovate.\"", "Former Google and Facebook executive Mary Lou Jepsen was in her 20s when she went home to die.

Already, the images they are able to create are more accurate and better defined than what you'd see with an MRI, she claimed.\n\nAlthough she has not yet offered a public demonstration of the technology, the company's investors and board of directors suggest strong scientific potential.\n\nJeff Huber, the vice chairman and founding CEO of $1.6 billion cancer-detecting Silicon Valley startup Grail, serves on Openwater's board of directors; Brook Byers, a founding partner of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins (which has funded Genentech) is an Openwater investor, along with Nicholas Negroponte, the co-founder of the MIT Media Lab and Michael McCullough, who directs the evolution and human behavior lab at the University of Miami.\n\nJepsen's ultimate goal is to get her product in people's homes, where they could be used to observe the effects of a medication in real time or help monitor the progression of a disease like cancer.\n\n\"I want everyone to be able to buy these machines in the drug store next to the blood pressure cuff,\" Jepsen said.\n\nFrom a storied career at Facebook and Google to her own startup\n\nJepsen spoke about her device at the 2017 Rock Health Summit, but remained vague on details. Rock Health Jepsen pitched her project to tech giants Google and Facebook before deciding to strike out on her own. She said the CEOs of each company expressed an interest in the idea at first but ultimately had her focus on other projects in virtual reality and augmented reality.\n\nHer roles at both companies were high-level positions that were heavy on engineering: at Google, Jepsen worked as the head of the company's display division within its secretive \"X\" division and reported directly to Google co-founder Sergey Brin. At Facebook, Jepsen served as the company's executive director of engineering and the head of display technologies at its virtual reality arm Oculus.\n\nBut Jepsen, an engineer with a PhD in optical sciences from Brown University, wanted to do more.\n\n\"I like video games just as much as the next person,\" Jepsen told Business Insider, but their capacity to help people and make a difference is limited, she said.\n\nSo last summer, Jepsen announced she was leaving Facebook to create her own company, called Openwater.\n\n'You don't have to biopsy if you can monitor'\n\nLast year, Jepsen described Openwater's device as a new imaging technology that could help \"cure diseases\" and could even be worn like a hat to see inside the brain. Such a device could help researchers better understand complex organs like the brain, where some aspects of mental illnesses like depression can currently be observed using an MRI.\n\nFor the process to work, timing is everything, Jepsen explained: the ultrasonic pings are emitted first so that they arrive at the same time as the infrared light, which is turned on shortly after. The light changes color as it moves past various structures in the brain or body \u2014 kind of like how the police siren on a cop car changes pitch as it drives past you.\n\nAnd the resulting image, which is produced through a combination of the light and the ultrasonic pings, will be able to detect the presence of a tumor, Jepsen said.\n\nJepsen's company is also working with a nonprofit organization called the Focused Ultrasound Foundation, based in Charlottesville, Virginia. to explore the possibility of someday using the technology for non-invasive surgery using sound waves, she added.\n\nOn Monday, Jepsen described one potential scenario for someone with breast cancer. First, her mini-MRI could likely diagnose the disease earlier because MRIs have 10 times the resolution of mammograms, she said. Currently, MRIs are recommended in addition to mammograms only for women with a high risk of breast cancer.\n\nBut in addition, if the device could be worn (for example, as part of a bra) it could be used to monitor the disease and any tumors, allowing the patient and her clinician to decide on surgery only when it was medically necessary, such as if the tumor began to grow.\n\n\"You don't have to biopsy if you can monitor,\" Jepsen said.\n\nThis story was updated with a new estimate of the MRI market based on estimates from healthcare research firm The Advisory Board.", "The special counsel Robert Mueller is expected to issue new indictments as part of the Russia investigation as soon as Tuesday, CBS reported, citing multiple sources with knowledge of the probe.\n\nMeanwhile, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker plans to consult with Department of Justice ethics officials about whether he should recuse himself from the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, a department representative said Monday.\n\nSince Mueller took over the investigation in May 2017, his team has charged four Americans once affiliated with Trump's campaign or administration, 13 Russian nationals, 12 Russian intelligence officers, three Russian companies, and three other people.\n\nThey include Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, and Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser.\n\nRead more: Here's everyone who has been charged and convicted in Mueller's Russia probe so far\n\nTalks between Manafort and Mueller's team have reportedly stalled.\n\nNovember and December are widely expected to be busy months for Mueller, following a quiet period during which prosecutors, following DOJ guidelines, avoided taking any actions that could be seen as influencing the outcome of the midterm elections.\n\nFor months, Mueller has been zeroing in on the longtime GOP strategist Roger Stone and his associates, and whether Stone or any other Trump associates had advance knowledge that Russia had stolen batches of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign and disseminated them via WikiLeaks, the pro-transparency group founded by Julian Assange.\n\nIn addition to Stone, Mueller has also focused on the far-right commentator Jerome Corsi, who told NBC News on Monday that Mueller's team told him he would be indicted.\n\n\"I don't recall ever meeting Julian Assange or getting information from anyone about what he had including the Podesta emails,\" Corsi said Monday, referring to John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman. \"But they have all your emails and phone records \u2026 They're very good at the perjury trap.\"", "An overnight rocket battle between Israel and Hamas is the latest in a conflict escalation that threatens a major war and worries those working for peace in the region.\n\nSimmering tensions were brought to a head and fighting to a level not seen since 2014 after a botched intelligence mission by undercover Israeli commando raid killed seven Palestinian fighters, including a Hamas commander, on Sunday.

It's the type of thing that elicits squeals of delight from people with good taste, a device people can't resist reaching out to touch, even though doing so automatically deposits fingerprints all over its glossy surface.\n\nYou'll want to own the XS Max because even holding the XS Max feels luxurious.\n\nBut the thing about the XS Max is that it's supposed to be a tool to make your life easier. It's not supposed to just look amazing \u2014 it's supposed to work amazingly well. And after spending a week with the device, I can say it does that. Mostly.\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe large display wasn't a bonus\n\nThere's no getting around it: The iPhone XS Max is huge.\n\nIts screen is outlandishly large, seemingly fit for the mitts of a giant rather than regular, human hands. If you've owned the iPhone 6 Plus, 7 Plus, or 8 Plus, you'll still notice a change. While the XS Max is basically the same overall size as the \"Plus\" models, it's as if Apple stretched the screen at the top and bottom to fill the space previously occupied by the home button and top corners. The result is a bigger screen in the same general form factor, and that change brings its own challenges.\n\nDuring my tests of the phone, there was never a circumstance in which I felt comfortable even holding the XS Max with one hand, and one-handed use is downright impossible \u2014 I'd estimate that my thumb was able to reach less than a third of the screen.\n\nFor the record, turning on reachability \u2014 an accessibility feature that shortens the app you're using to half the height of the screen \u2014 didn't solve the problem. I still couldn't reach the entire screen, which literally defeats the purpose of the feature.\n\nFor me, someone with smaller hands, this was a major downside of the XS Max. There are so many situations where I need to use my phone one-handed, and it's neither possible nor smart to try to do that with the XS Max.\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nBeyond not being able to reach all four corners of the screen, I was constantly wondering what the actual point was of having such an enormous display. Sure, you can see more of an app at a time, and if you have poor eyesight, I imagine having a large font on a large screen would be beneficial.\n\nBut for me, the huge screen was just an annoyance. I could see all the ways it would be cool to have a big screen, but none played out during regular use. It would have been great to watch a video that took up the entire display, but that's not possible \u2014 each one had large black bars on the top and bottom, and sometimes on the sides. The same went for games.\n\nThe huge screen didn't help me be more productive, or creative, or even more entertained \u2014 it just made me feel frustrated.\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe camera really is that great\n\nIt's true: The camera on the XS Max is better than those of most other phones on the market.\n\nFor me, the bar for smartphone cameras is usually set by Google's Pixel lineup; I've never been disappointed. That remains mostly true of the Pixel 3, which came out last month.\n\nBut in a few situations while using both devices, I felt as though the XS Max actually performed better. We'll have a full test of both phones side by side soon, but for now I can say that portrait mode on the iPhone has definitely improved. I was impressed by my portrait-mode photos and thought they were better than the Pixel's for the first time maybe ever.\n\nLet's not get ahead ourselves, though \u2014 if you have the iPhone X, and maybe even the iPhone 8 Plus, I can't imagine the camera on the XS Max is so much better that you need to upgrade. It's great, but it's not life-changing.\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe same old iOS\n\nSince this was an \"S year,\" there's so much about the XS Max that's identical to last year's iPhone X.\n\nThe design is unchanged, apart from the new gold color, and everything else has been refined rather than overhauled. The battery life appears to be slightly better \u2014 I typically got well over a full day, though the iPhone X already had great battery life \u2014 and some minor features were improved, like less shutter lag when you take a photo. Plus, it's slightly faster overall, thanks to a new chip.\n\nBut much about the XS Max is the same as the X, and the XR, and even iPhones from two, three, four years ago, and that's because of iOS. Once you get over some of the biggest changes of upgrading to a fancy new phone, you're left with the exact same operating system that everyone else has. And no, you probably won't use features like Memoji and Animoji very often. You might even forget about them altogether.\n\nThat's what makes Apple so great, and also so frustrating. If you bought an iPhone 8, for example, you still have a fantastic phone that works mostly like the brand-new phone. But that also makes it hard for me to justify the XS Max's high price tag \u2014 you're shelling out at least $1,100 for a beautiful design with incremental improvements.\n\nSo yes, go ahead and buy the iPhone XS Max (in gold!) if you're obsessed with design, have an old iPhone and now want the very best and very biggest of what Apple makes, have big hands, or are just super rich.\n\nApple's biggest-screen iPhone commands its biggest price tag yet for an iPhone, but it also demands the attention of everyone around it. It will make you look very, very fancy.", "President Donald Trump mocked France's war record in a Tuesday-morning tweet that again waved the idea of the US pulling out of, or modifying its relationship to, NATO.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has long pushed for a European army separate from NATO, the global military alliance that includes the US and Canada and has sought to secure the continent against Russian aggression that has grown since the end of World War II.\n\nSpurred by the US's withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which eliminated a category of nuclear weapons and almost denuclearized the continent, Macron renewed his calls to break away from depending on US military might.\n\n\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia, and even the United States of America,\" Macron said on November 6.

And the explanation is far from clear.\n\n\"The issuance of the detailed regulations for implementation has been postponed after study,\" Ding Xuedong, a recently-appointed deputy secretary-general at China's State Council, told the state-run Xinhua news agency on Monday, in an interview translated on China.org.\n\nHe added that the council would allow for the regulated use of tiger and rhino parts for scientific research, sales of cultural relics, and medical research or in healing.\n\nIn other words, the policy change is not a full 180-degree pivot, but more of a bureaucratic holding pattern following unanticipated popular blowback.\n\nRhino horns displayed at the Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok in March 2017. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha\n\nThe unexpected October circular seemed to walk back on China's recent and historic commitments to wildlife protection. Only last year China placed a long-awaited ban on the trade in ivory, extending a much-needed lifeline to endangered species.\n\nPerhaps following the widely-lambasted decision to lift rhino and tiger trade last month, Ding on Monday told Xinhua that China would continue to enforce its \"three strict bans\" on the trade, transport, and use of rhino and tiger products.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Relevant departments of the Chinese government will soon continue to organize special crackdown campaigns with focus on addressing the illegal trade of rhinos, tigers and their byproducts.\n\n\"Once again, I would like to reiterate that the Chinese government is willing to work with the international community to jointly strive for protecting wildlife and building our harmonious and beautiful planet.\"\n\nDing went on to vow that any illegal acts will be \"dealt with severely.\"\n\nChina prohibited the trade of rhino horn and tiger bones in 1993, but perhaps as a consequence the price for rhino horn began to edge higher and peaked a few years ago at around$65,000 per kilogram.\n\nA product made with ivory from endangered animals, as can be seen in a 2012 video by CNBC.

Timothy Verrill, 36, was charged in connection with the murders in November 2017. He pleaded not guilty, and awaits trial in May 2019.\n\nProsecutors requested access to recordings from an Echo which was at the house where the women were found, hidden under the porch. Police initially seized the Echo as evidence after searching the house.\n\n\"Investigators believe Sullivan was attacked in the kitchen of 979 Meaderboro Road where the Echo was located, and prosecutors believe there is probable cause to believe there is evidence on the Echo, such as audio recordings of the attack and events that followed it,\" prosecutors said in court documents, as reported by CBS Boston.\n\nProsecutors believe there may be recordings from between January 27 and 29, 2017, the period in which they believe the women were murdered.\n\nAmazon's AI assistant Alexa (which works on Echo devices) listens out for \"wake-up words\" and records snippets of audio when it thinks it hears one.

Depending on whom you ask and which metric you examine \u2014 like the ratio of enterprise value to sales, for example \u2014 tech stocks have been enriched with dot-com-bubble-like valuations during this bull market.\n\n\"These are great companies, but what matters isn't what gets delivered \u2014 it's what's in the price,\" he said. \"If great companies are priced to be invincible companies, they can be a really bad investment.\"\n\nWhat normally follows such exuberance is a slow decline in the growth rates that made the stocks attractive to investors in the first place, Needham said.\n\nBig tech is already showing what happens when expectations get reined in. Facebook, Amazon, and Apple were among the growth companies that missed expectations for growth when they reported third-quarter earnings in October.\n\nThe sell-off in growth stocks has helped to lower the lofty valuations that skeptics have been decrying all along. But this has not automatically created the incentive to buy. Needham noted that while large-cap tech had cheapened, so have other sectors of the market and regions of the world. This means growth is cheaper on an absolute basis but not necessarily relative to its alternatives.\n\nInvestors who have stuck with growth in the nine-year-plus bull market have enjoyed the best returns. That's a reason to be cautious about timing the market incorrectly by exiting too far ahead of the next bear market. Moreover, the biggest gains have historically come in a bull market's latter stages.\n\nNeedham's message to investors with this concern is to gradually turn more defensive.\n\n\"Even if the rally continues, each incremental return is going to get riskier,\" he said. \"If you're investing for the full range of outcomes, then you should recognize that there's a future that could be quite painful, and so that would warrant more defensive positioning.\"\n\nHe's not advocating an all-or-nothing allocation to stocks. Rather, investors should figure out how much downside they're willing to tolerate in their portfolios and then invest accordingly.\n\n\"The more asset prices fall, the more excited we get,\" Needham said. \"To quote Warren Buffett, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices that pessimism brings.\"\n\nBesides narrowing their gap with the broader stock market, high-growth companies are also on track to curb their outperformance relative to value stocks \u2014 or those trading at much lower prices relative to their intrinsic worth and fundamentals like earnings, Needham said.\n\nHe's not the only investor who thinks value stocks have been so maligned that they're poised for a rebound. Strategists at Societe Generale have also made the case for the resurgence of this investing factor, arguing that value stocks have been an effective hedge against the steepest market drawdowns since the 1920s.\n\nThey added that if the mood in global markets continued turning more bearish, value stocks would be appealing to investors wary of overpaying for future earnings growth.", "Singapore Airlines has been named the best airline in the world for 2019 by AirlineRatings.com.

The iPhone maker's share price was down more than 5% at the end of trading, taking its market cap below $1 trillion at the close for the first time since it hit the milestone in August.\n\nThe reason for the battering: a slew of analyst reports suggesting iPhone unit sales could drop year-over-year as soon as the first quarter of 2019.\n\nIt was another low in a bad few weeks for Apple's share price. After the firm's stock hit a high of $232 on October 3, with a value of $1.16 trillion, it then lost just under $190 billion from its market cap over the subsequent five or so weeks. That's not far off the gross domestic product of Greece.\n\nRead more: Apple is getting crushed after analysts predict that iPhone unit sales will shrink next year\n\nTo put that into further perspective: It took Apple nearly 30 years to reach a valuation of $190 billion. The company went public on December 12, 1980. Its $190 billion valuation came in March 2010, according to Macrotrends.\n\nmacrotrends\n\nThe driver of the iPhone sales slump projected in bearish analyst reports is that Apple's new $749 phone, the lower-end iPhone XR, may not be the hot seller that Apple had hoped, and the company may be cutting orders for the device.\n\nApple is not the only tech stock to be hit in recent weeks. Amazon also lost its $1 trillion valuation in October, while Facebook, Netflix, and Google have also slumped.", "A judge in New Hampshire, US, has ordered Amazon to hand over any audio recorded on an Amazon Echo device as prosecutors believe it may contain evidence about a double homicide.\n\nChristine Sullivan and Jenna Pelligrini were found dead with multiple stab wounds in January 2017. Timothy Verrill, 36, was charged in connection with the murders in November 2017. He pleaded not guilty, and awaits trial in May 2019.\n\nProsecutors requested access to recordings from an Echo which was at the house where the women were found, hidden under the porch. Police initially seized the Echo as evidence after searching the house.\n\n\"Investigators believe Sullivan was attacked in the kitchen of 979 Meaderboro Road where the Echo was located, and prosecutors believe there is probable cause to believe there is evidence on the Echo, such as audio recordings of the attack and events that followed it,\" prosecutors said in court documents, as reported by CBS Boston.\n\nProsecutors believe there may be recordings from between January 27 and 29, 2017, the period in which they believe the women were murdered.\n\nAmazon's AI assistant Alexa (which works on Echo devices) listens out for \"wake-up words\" and records snippets of audio when it thinks it hears one. Prosecutors also point out that the Echo would contain records of paired devices.\n\nStrafford County Superior Court Presiding Justice Steven M.

Amazon objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate demands as a matter of course.\"\n\nThis isn't the first case in which prosecutors have sought evidence recorded by an Amazon Echo. After the death of an Arkansas police officer in a hot tub in 2015, prosecutors sought to compel Amazon to hand over any recordings that might show whether he was murdered.\n\nAmazon initially refused to hand over the data, saying that government demands could \"chill\" first amendment rights. But once the defendant and owner of the Echo consented, Amazon complied. The murder charge was eventually dismissed.", "Trade relations between the US and China appear to be thawing ahead of a planned informal meeting between President Donald Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping later this month.\n\nTrump and Xi are expected to hold an informal meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at the end of November, and senior officials from both countries seem to be priming the pump with a series of preparatory meetings.\n\nMost recently, the South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He was set to fly to Washington, DC, ahead of the Buenos Aires meeting with the aim of meeting senior officials in the Trump administration.\n\nThe report added that his exact travel date was unclear.\n\nSeparately, The Wall Street Journal reported overnight that US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held a phone conversation with Liu on Friday evening to discuss the trade issues.

Trump reportedly plans to meet with his trade team Tuesday to discuss the report. Releasing a Commerce Department report on auto tariffs would be the next formal step toward imposing such restrictions.\n\nThe US government has already introduced tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods entering the US, prompting Chinese policymakers to introduce retaliatory tariffs on US goods entering the nation, albeit on a smaller scale.\n\nTrump has previously threatened to place tariffs on all US imports from China, an amount totaling more than $500 billion annually, a move that would most likely slow global trade significantly.\n\nStocks have greeted the potential for further dialogue between the world's two largest economies, with China's benchmark Shanghai Composite gaining close to 1% on Tuesday and major European bourses rising as much as 0.7%. The Euro Stoxx 50 broad index was about 0.6% higher.\n\nUS stock index futures were also up slightly after a tech-led sell-off Monday.", "LONDON \u2014 Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is preparing to lead a group of Cabinet ministers arguing that a no-deal exit would be preferable to a deal that breaches their red lines.\n\nThe group of ministers will tell the prime minister that the current deal being offered by the EU is unacceptable and say that May should leave with no deal if Brussels does not make more concessions, Buzzfeed reported.\n\nThe ministers will insist that the EU drops its Northern Ireland-only \"backstop to the backstop\" measure and that the deal should include a \"break clause\" mechanism which allows the UK to leave a UK-wide customs arrangement without EU consent.\n\nThe move from such senior colleagues in Cabinet makes the prospect of a no-deal exit significantly more likely and offers May an even bigger headache as she struggles to bring back a deal from Brussels which will have the support of her Cabinet and then of parliament.\n\nEU officials have repeatedly insisted that they will not give in to demands over the Irish backstop \u2014 an insurance measure designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland \u2014 which they see as integral to any divorce deal.\n\nDominic Raab has previously said the UK could be forced to leave without a deal but it was widely seen as a negotiating tactic.\n\nIn the last week, however, he has encouraged other ministers that a no-deal scenario would be manageable, Buzzfeed reported.\n\nNumber 10 had previously calculated that ministers could be bounced into supporting a deal by fear of a chaotic exit with no deal. But ministers have now decided to take a tougher line after deciding that May's deal would fail to pass through parliament.\n\n\"There is no point agreeing a deal which will be voted down by parliament, cause the PM to fall, and result in chaos,\" a Cabinet source told Buzzfeed.\n\nIs the deal slipping away?\n\nDominic Raab Jeff Overs/BBC via Getty Images)\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier claimed on Monday that the main elements of the divorce treaty text were ready for May to present to the UK cabinet on Tuesday.\n\nBut the growing resolve among pro-Brexit ministers to oppose any deal which does not contain their demands over the backstop means the chances of a successful deal are decreasing fast.\n\nDowning Street has also been hit by the resignation of Remain-supporting minister Jo Johnson on Friday, who warned that the prime minister was offering the public a choice between \"vassalage and chaos\" and called for a fresh Brexit referendum. The resignation indicates that even moderate Remainers in the party will struggle to support her deal, in which case it would almost certainly be voted down in parliament", "Hello!

Amnesty International cannot justify your continued status as a recipient of the Ambassador of Conscience award and so with great sadness we are hereby withdrawing it from you.\"\n\nThe international human rights group named Suu Kyi as its 2009 Ambassador of Conscience Award recipient when she was still under house arrest as the de facto leader of opposition to Myanmar's oppressive military junta led by the country's powerful generals.\n\nIn the eight years since she was released, Suu Kyi led her party to election victory in 2015 and set up a government the following year, but she has had to share power with generals and has no oversight and no appetite to rein in military forces.\n\n'A shameful betrayal'\n\nAmnesty International said in a statement on Tuesday Suu Kyi had failed to speak out and had \"shielded the security forces from accountability.\"\n\nAmnesty called Suu Kyi's failure to stand against the violence against the Rohingya, a \"shameful betrayal of the values she once stood for.\"\n\nAung San Suu Kyi greets Burmese immigrants at Talad Talay Thai Hall in Bangkok, Thailand. Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi arrived in Thailand on Thursday, where she met immigrants from her country during the three-day official visit to Thailand. It was Suu Kyi's highest profile overseas visit since her pro-democracy party took power in April, after nearly half a century of military rule. Borja Sanchez-Trillo/Getty Images\n\nUnited Nations investigators have most recently in October concluded that Myanmar's generals directed a campaign of killings, rape and arson upon the Rohingya with \"genocidal intent.\"\n\nA United Nations report released in August shows how during a Myanmar \"clearance operation\" in September last year, soldiers shot and stabbed villagers, raped women, and burned homes while driving 6,000 ethnic Rohingya from their homes at Inn Din.\n\nA Reuters investigation in February detailed the murder of 10 Rohingya men and boys at the hands of Myanmar troops, police officers and Rakhine Buddhist villagers on September 2, 2017. The Myanmar government corroborated this report when it sentenced seven soldiers involved to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nAltogether it is thought more than 700,000 stateless Rohingya fled across Myanmar's western border into Bangladesh after the Myanmar military launched a crackdown in response to a Rohingya insurgency targeting Myanmar security forces.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Suu Kyi's administration rejected the findings and said the military was engaged in a legitimate counter-insurgency operation.\n\nWhen the generals talk\n\nHuman-rights lawyer Chris Sidoti told Business Insider that placing pressure on Suu Kyi has no impact unless the generals are being isolated.\n\nSidoti, currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council's Independent International Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar and an adjunct professor at the Australian Catholic University said a binding council resolution passed in October was a far more effective tool to pressure the ultimate perpetrators of the persecution of the Rohingya.\n\n\"The Myanmar generals are now under more pressure than they have ever been. They are fast running out of friends, running out of countries where they can feel safe from international justice,\" Sidoti said.\n\nLast month, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution to establish a new mechanism to prepare cases to prosecute them for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The resolution had overwhelming support. It was carried in the 47 member Council by 35 votes to 3. (Seven states abstained and two were not in the room for the vote.) Over 100 UN member states co-spons\n\nThe International Court of Justice has also commenced an investigation heading towards prosecutions.\n\n\"The generals face a future where, if they set foot in any country in the world, they could be arrested and charged and prosecuted for crimes under international law in local courts or be handed over to the International Criminal Court,\" Sidoti said.\n\n\"In addition many states have already imposed targeted travel and financial sanctions on many of the top generals.\"\n\nAt this stage however, Myanmar's top two, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and Vice Senior General Soe Win, haven't been targeted but Sidoti says, \"it is only a matter of time.\"\n\nThe fact-finding mission has recommended sanctions on them both.\n\nSidoti says, \"for Myanmar, this is very good news. Myanmar has no future with the generals running the country.\"\n\nThe 50-year military junta \u2014 an effective dictatorship \u2014 has left the country economically ruined and politically infantile, with Suu Kyi presenting little more than an internationally acceptable face.\n\n\"Myanmar has now endured 70 years of civil war, due to the dismal failures of the generals. Its transition to democracy has barely begun and has now seems permanently stalled.\"\n\n\"The country and its people have a future only if the military is transformed. That can only begin when all the top generals have been removed,\" Sidoti said.\n\nFew honors left\n\nReuters reports that in March, the US Holocaust Memorial Museum withdrew its top award from Suu Kyi and she has been stripped of other significant honours, including the freedom of the cities of Dublin and Oxford, England, over the Rohingya crisis.\n\nIn September, Canada's parliament voted to strip Suu Kyi of her honorary citizenship.\n\nWhile some critics have called for her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize to be withdrawn, the foundation that oversees the award said it would not do so.\n\nSpeaking at a business forum in Singapore ahead of the ASEAN regional summit, pleaded for international investment to return to Myanmar.\n\nShe did not address the ongoing crisis which has driven hundreds of thousands of the Muslim minority into crumbling and dangerous camps on the border with Bangladesh and extinguished hopes of a brighter future for Myanmar.\n\nAmnesty International also accused Suu Kyi of not condemned military abuses in conflicts between the army and ethnic minority guerrillas in northern Myanmar and her government had imposed restrictions on access by humanitarian groups.", "Hello!

Nielsen served in her role for nearly one year, after replacing White House chief of staff John Kelly in December 2017.\n\nThe department's press secretary said in a statement to Business Insider that Nielsen was honored to serve in the Trump administration and was committed to continuing her service.\n\n\"The Secretary is honored to lead the men and women of DHS and is committed to implementing the President's security-focused agenda to protect Americans from all threats and will continue to do so,\" the press secretary said.\n\nNielsen's role in the Trump administration has been uncertain for some time. She reportedly drafted a resignation letter in May. Trump is believed to have berated her in front of other cabinet officials over his belief that she did a poor job securing the US-Mexico border, former officials said in a New York Times report.\n\nNielsen, who is the leading authority in curbing illegal immigration, said she shared Trump's frustration after news of her alleged letter was made public. A Homeland Security spokesperson later denied the claims of the alleged letter to Business Insider.\n\n\"Border security is the most basic and necessary responsibility of a sovereign nation,\" Nielsen's statement said, following the news of her letter.\n\nNielsen's colleagues said she was unhappy in her role for several months, and Trump has expressed interest in considering candidates to replace her, The Post reported.\n\n\"If I were advising the White House I'd encourage them to nominate someone with executive branch experience,\" one senior Homeland Security official said to The Post. \"This will be our fourth secretary in two years. The last thing we want is someone who needs hand-holding.\"\n\nNielsen previously worked as Kelly's chief of staff. She also served in the Homeland Security Council during George W. Bush's administration before working in a private consulting firm.", "Jerome Corsi, a far-right political commentator and longtime associate of Roger Stone, said this week that the special counsel Robert Mueller told him he will be charged in the Russia investigation for perjury.\n\n\"They told me they were going to indict me,\" Corsi told NBC News on Monday.\n\n\"I fully anticipate that the next few days I will be indicted by Mueller for some form rather [sic] of giving false information to the special counsel ... or [however] they want to do the indictment,\" Corsi said on a YouTube livestream. \"But I'm going to be criminally charged.\"\n\n\"I think my crime, really, was that I dared to support Donald Trump,\" Corsi said. \"Supporting President Trump ... Now I'm going to have to go to prison the rest of my life because I dared to oppose the deep state.\"\n\nCorsi was served a subpoena in August by Mueller to testify before a grand jury. Mueller was reportedly investigating whether Corsi had prior knowledge of the Hillary Clinton campaign's hacked emails \u2014 which were later delivered to and published online by secrets-leaking organization WikiLeaks \u2014 and whether he passed those emails on to Stone.\n\nStone, a GOP strategist and former adviser to Donald Trump, was under scrutiny by the special counsel for his connection with Julian Assange, WikiLeaks' founder, and Guccifer 2.0, an online identity believed to be part of the Russia's military-intelligence arm.\n\nResponding to reports that Corsi will be indicted, Stone cast doubt on Mueller's investigation and indicated that the special counsel does not have enough proof against him or Corsi. He pointed out that he has taken two polygraph tests and passed both. He also said his attorneys have reviewed all his written communications with the far-right commentator.\n\n\"When those aren't viewed out of context they prove everything I have said under oath regarding my interaction with Dr. Corsi is true,\" Stone said. \"It is possible to take individual communications out of context to create a false impression to a grand jury. Such a case would be weak and would fail. I stand by my statement to the House Intelligence Committee and can prove it is truthful if need be.\"\n\nStone added: \"Watching his podcast, Dr. Corsi strikes me as a man who has been squeezed hard but refuses to do anything but tell the truth which is why they may be indicting him.\"\n\nJerome Corsi. Charles Sykes/AP Images\n\nFederal prosecutors indicted 12 Russian military officers for the hack in July and provided evidence that connected WikiLeaks' ties to Guccifer 2.0.\n\nCorsi, formerly the Washington bureau chief of conspiracy-theory-website InfoWars, suggested Mueller had material evidence for his case.\n\n\"When they have your emails and phone records ... they're very good at the perjury trap,\" Corsi said to NBC producer Anna Schecter.\n\nIn 2016, days before a trove of emails were leaked, Stone made several statements on Twitter that eventually attracted attention from investigators. Stone previously tweeted \"it will soon [be] Podesta's time in the barrel,\" in reference to John Podesta, Clinton's embattled campaign manager, whose emails were breached.\n\nCorsi later claimed to be the inspiration behind Stone's tweets that suggested Podesta's brewing troubles. One person familiar with the situation said Mueller's team was reviewing communications with Trump's associates, in which Corsi and Stone appeared to take credit for the release of the hacked emails, according to NBC News. The source added that there has yet to be evidence of their potential involvement in the email's hack or subsequent release to the public.\n\nCorsi denied having prior knowledge of the emails. Stone reportedly described his alleged ties with Russia as a \"left-wing conspiracy theory\" and claimed Corsi did not tip him off about WikiLeaks' possession of the emails prior to its public release.\n\n\"For the record, I have never had any communication of any kind with Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, or Guccifer 2.0, or any Russian agents of any kind, including those mythical Russian agents who the Democrats believe wanted to throw the election for Trump,\" Corsi reportedly wrote on InfoWars in March 2017.", "Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker will consult with ethics officials at the Department of Justice (DOJ) about whether a recusal from overseeing the Russia investigation is warranted, according to a DOJ spokesperson.\n\n\"Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker is fully committed to following all appropriate processes and procedures at the Department of Justice, including consulting with senior ethics officials on his oversight responsibilities and matters that may warrant recusal,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe news is significant \u2014 it comes after a steady stream of revelations about Whitaker's history of making antagonistic comments about the Russia investigation and the special counsel Robert Mueller. If Whitaker were to recuse himself, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would resume oversight of the investigation. Though DOJ officials typically follow the recommendations of ethics officials, they are not required to do so.\n\nMueller is investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 US election, whether members of President Donald Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow, and whether Trump sought to obstruct justice after he learned of the investigation's existence last year.\n\nTrump last week ousted then Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replaced him with Whitaker following months of resentment toward Sessions for recusing himself from overseeing the investigation last year. Trump took a liking to Whitaker after he saw him on CNN last year criticizing Mueller and espousing more partisan views about the Russia investigation.\n\nRead more:'Seriously? This guy?': Matthew Whitaker's appointment as acting attorney general has FBI and DOJ officials in a 'daze'\n\nOnce described as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the Justice Department, Whitaker has publicly mused about gutting the Russia investigation. As recently as last week, it was believed that Whitaker does not plan to recuse himself from overseeing the inquiry, and The Washington Post also reported that if Mueller wanted to subpoena the president, Whitaker would not allow it.\n\nAmong other things, Whitaker wrote in a CNN op-ed article last year that Mueller had overstepped his mandate by digging into the Trump Organization's finances. He has said, without evidence, that there was \"no collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia. And audio recently resurfaced of Whitaker falsely accusing \"the left\" of sowing \"this theory that essentially Russians interfered with the US election,\" a theory he claimed had been disproved and did not affect the election.\n\nWhile he was Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker met with Trump in the Oval Office more than a dozen times, The Washington Post reported, adding that whenever Trump complained about the Russia investigation, Whitaker \"often smiled knowingly and nodded in assent.\"", "In the era of YouTube and Twitch, professional video gamers rely on home studio setups to broadcast their gameplay to the millions of viewers around the world. Most home studios have humble beginnings, in a basement or in a kitchen. But if a streamer becomes successful, they soon need a set-up capable of an increasingly high level of production to serve a growing audience.\n\nThe world's most popular gamer, Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins, has nearly 20 million subscribers on YouTube and became the first Twitch streamer to reach 10 million followers earlier this year. Ninja spends about 12 hours a day playing live on Twitch from his basement studio and has brought home as much as $500,000 a month through subscription fees and donations. His meteoric rise to the top of the video game world with \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" has earned him a number of valuable opportunities, including commercials with Samsung, an ESPN the Magazine cover story, and an ongoing sponsorship from Red Bull.\n\nRed Bull recently partnered with Portland-based creative agency Roundhouse to help Ninja redesign his home streaming setup, his primary base of operations. Roundhouse Creative Director Robert Medkeff flew to meet Ninja in Chicago where they discussed how to upgrade the studio and maintain his personal flair. The agency has worked on major gaming-related projects with Red Bull and Twitch in the past, but designing a state-of-the-art studio brought forth a new set of challenges. Roundhouse presented Ninja with a number of potential plans for the studio; once the gamer chose his favorite, they began fleshing the design out with the best possible technology and lighting options.\n\nThe studio fills the entire basement room. Red Bull\n\n\"His new studio needed to inspire creativity and support multiple types of content, and stand out as the first gaming studio of its kind,\" Medkeff told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nWhile most of Ninja's streams consist of him playing at his desk, the new studio encompasses the full basement room. The space was given a custom acoustic treatment and has been fully outfitted with controllable, color changing LED lighting. Once wall includes eight different monitors for Ninja to host graphics or playback video from his dedicated video server. Another portion of the room has a dedicated analyst desk in place for when Ninja hosts friends or steps away from the action for a bit. Four different Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 4K 60 fps broadcast cameras in the room are able to see the action from every angle while a mixture of Electrovoice and Shure broadcast microphones capture audio.\n\nNinja standing at the analyst desk inside the studio. Red Bull\n\nRed Bull declined to share the budget for the studio design, but the equipment alone is worth more than $20,000. The goal of the studio is to be a one-stop shop for any type of gaming broadcast and everything in the room can be controlled from a digital switch board on Ninja's desk. Despite the big time studio upgrades, Ninja will still be using the same custom built NZXT computer and the free Open Broadcaster Software to stream.\n\nRoundhouse also worked to ensure that Ninja's personality was preserved within the studio. Medkeff said the partnership between Ninja and Red Bull was balanced and stress-free. The room was designed with Ninja's personal branding in mind but the space isn't dominated by sponsor logos.\n\nDozens of his personal trinkets line the room, including trophies, Funko POP figures, a \"Fortnite\" pickaxe, and a signed Detroit Lions football helmet. Medkeff said the look of the trophy wall will evolve as Ninja adds more personal effects. Roundhouse filled the studio with a fair share of secret features too, for example, Ninja's dogs have access to a small Murphy bed that pops out of one of the studio's walls.\n\nThe studio even has custom built space for Ninja's dogs. Red Bull\n\n\"I don't want to give away too many things, because there are a lot of nice little hidden things that Ninja will reveal when he streams,\" Medkeff said.\n\nWhile playing \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" alongside superstar artists like Drake and Travis Scott and winning major tournaments has helped Ninja gain a celebrity profile during the last year, he began competitive gaming with \"Halo 3\" in 2009. In August, Business Insider spoke with his wife and manager, Jessica Blevins, about how they have handled his skyrocketing career."]
