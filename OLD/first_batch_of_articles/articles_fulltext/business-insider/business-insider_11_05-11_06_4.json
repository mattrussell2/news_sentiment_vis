Last month the South Korean Game Rating and Administration Committee leaked ratings for a PlayStation 4 version of the game as well. A representative for the game declined to comment.\n\n\"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,\" or \"PUBG,\" was officially released on PC in May 2017 and has been console exclusive to the Xbox One since December 2017. The game was in Microsoft's Xbox Game Preview program until September 4th, when version 1.0 was officially released. The mobile version of the game is also one of the most popular video games in China.\n\nRead more:The company behind 'PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' has reportedly dropped its lawsuit against the wildly popular 'Fortnite'\n\nLike \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" and other games that it inspired, \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" throws 100 players onto a single map with scattered resources. Players need to find weapons and items to defend themselves as the safe areas of the map begin to shrink. The last player or team surviving at the end of the round is the winner.\n\nThough \"PUBG\" helped pioneer the battle royale genre, the game has seen its star wane, even as rivals like \"Fortnite\" have skyrocketed to success and challengers like \"Call of Duty's\" Blackout and \"Battlefield V's\" Firestorm continue to crop up. and. \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" has a smaller development team than those games and has struggled to keep up with the demands of a massive community.\n\nIn November of 2017, \"PUBG\" was averaging 1.3 million players each day, according to SteamCharts, which tracks players on Steam, the most popular platform for PC games. The average number of daily \"PUBG\" players has since dwindled to about 450,000 over the last 30 days.\n\nStill, \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" remains one of the three most popular games on Steam by a wide margin, alongside \"Dota 2\" and \"CounterStrike: Global Offensive.\"\n\nWith \"PUBG\" available on multiple platforms, players are wondering if Bluehole will be able to implement cross-platform play. Earlier this year \"Fortnite\" became the first game to offer cross-platform play between the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile devices. Bluehole has expressed interest in allowing cross-platform play in the past, but nothing has been confirmed.\n\n\"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" is currently available on PC and Xbox One for $29.99. This hypothetical PS4 version will likely carry a similar price.", "Healthcare was the driving issue for many Americans in Tuesday's midterm elections, according to early exit polls, and the focus could be a good sign for Democrats.\n\nAccording to early exit polls, healthcare was the most important issue for a plurality of voters in the midterms. An exit poll conducted by CNN, NBC, and other major outlets found 40% of Americans picking healthcare as their most important issue. Immigration came in second with roughly 20% of people selecting it as the top issue.\n\nAn exit poll conducted by the Associated Press' Votecast system also found that healthcare was the most important issue, but by a slimmer margin. 26% of Americans selected healthcare as the top issue with immigration nabbing a 23% share and 19% of people picking the economy.\n\nRead more: Midterms 2018 LIVE: Follow along for live results and coverage of a wild election night\n\nHealthcare was a dominant theme for Democrats throughout the election season with both House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer imploring candidates to focus on the issue during the waning days of the campaign.\n\n\"I write to acknowledge the vital role Congressional Democrats played in protecting the Affordable Care Act and exposing the GOP's monstrous health care agenda - and I urge all of us to continue to push this message in the next 24 hours,\" Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues on Monday.\n\nRead more: The 2018 midterms will have a big impact on healthcare, from Medicaid to nurses to abortion \u2014 here are the key issues\n\nThe focus on healthcare may also be a good, though incredibly early, sign for Democrats' hopes of retaking the House of Representatives. According to polling done before the election, Americans generally trusted the party more on healthcare and Democrats poured money into advertising on the issue.\n\nAdditionally, support for Obamacare and the law's preexisting conditions protections are at relative high points \u2014 both are issues that the Democrats harped on in the lead up to Election Day.\n\nOn the flip side, Trump and the GOP largely played defense on healthcare and attempted to turn the focus onto the strong economy or immigration issues like the migrant caravan. But that fight seems to have been blunted.\n\nThe results do come with a few caveats. Exit polls are prone to unreliability and just because voters were focused on healthcare doesn't mean that they voted for Democrats.\n\nBut Democrats largely wanted the midterm elections to be a referendum on the GOP's handling of healthcare and it appears the party got its wish.", "While Greg Poulin, co-founder and CEO of Goodly, was attending Dartmouth, his father passed away unexpectedly. On top of the emotional toll, he also ended up having to borrow $80,000 in student loans to pay his tuition.\n\nPoulin has since moved to San Francisco, the thriving-but-pricey hub of the startup world, and he's still chipping away at his loans with a monthly payment of about $900 a month. Frustrated by his experiences, he founded Goodly, a platform for companies to offer employees assistance with their student loans as a benefit.\n\nGoodly allows companies to make a monthly contribution to their employees' student loans, similar to how companies often match 401(k) contributions. Based in San Francisco, Goodly was founded just this April, launched with a $120,000 seed investment as a part of the summer batch from famed startup program Y Combinator.\n\n\"Most employers don't know that student loan benefits exist. It's both a challenge and an opportunity for us,\" Poulin told Business Insider. \"It's helped us completely define a new category of benefits.\"\n\nCompanies often offer perks like gym memberships, massage chairs and snacks, but the money can be better allocated to helping employees pay student loans, Poulin says. That way, student loan repayment won't be a large expense for companies. This benefit, he says, could help with both recruiting and retention.\n\n\"The problem is those employees are saddled with crippling student loan debt,\" Poulin said. \"Gym memberships aren't going to cut it when it comes to recruiting employees.\"\n\nHemant Verma, co-founder and CTO of Goodly, also had to pay off debts from his own education in India.\n\n\"This is a massive problem for people,\" Verma told Business Insider. \"It's the biggest problem our generation is facing...This was a mission we were energized with.\"\n\nThe scale of the problem\n\nToday, 70% of college students graduate with debt, and over 44 million Americans collectively owe $1.5 trillion in student debt. An American Student Assistance survey reported that 76% of respondents said student loan repayment benefit would be a deciding or contributing factor to accepting a job offer.\n\nThe average college graduate has $37,172 in student loans, by some estimates, up $20,000 from 13 years ago. It makes sense that the demand for student loan benefits is rising.\n\n\"For millennials, they bear the grunt of student loans,\" Poulin said. \"It's an issue where we see people of all backgrounds.\"\n\nThis could potentially impact diversity and inclusion at companies as well, as student loans disproportionately affect women and people of color. For example, research shows that women carry two-thirds of the nation's student debt load, and that African American students are four times more likely to default on their student loans than their white peers.\n\nPoulin has seen Goodly's customers make contributions of $25 to $300 a month to repaying their employees' student loans. On average, employers contribute $100 a month.\n\n\"We've had companies of all sizes reach out to us,\" Poulin said. \"We've been really blown away by the interest of companies we've seen. It's not surprising when so many are leaving the company in debt. This is a problem they've struggled with. It's exciting to see companies that are working to proactively help their employees solve this challenge.\"\n\nGet started early\n\nFor Poulin, one thing that has helped him was making bi-weekly payments instead of monthly payments.\n\n\"Over the course of the year, you'll make an additional payment,\" Poulin said. \"It could shave off two years over the repayment period.\"\n\nStill, student loan repayments can impede employees from making future investments such as graduate school, buying a house, marriage and retirement. Poulin sees investing in retirement as his biggest challenge, especially when he first started working after graduation.\n\n\"I was contributing very little, if at all,\" Poulin said. \"Student loan debt is a major barrier. When you delay contributing to the 401(k), there's a large compounding effect.\"\n\nHaving faced the issue of paying off student debt themselves, Poulin and Verma hope Goodly can help people slash the amount of time it takes to pay off loans.\n\n\"We want to make student loans obsolete,\" Verma said. \"Student loans get a bad rep for most people. In terms of investments, it's still a good thing basically. You're able to upgrade your life. Our goal is not to get rid of it completely, but make sure you can pay it off as fast as possible.\"", "I just got to put my hands on what's supposed to be the future of smartphones.\n\nMy first impression: The future still needs some work.\n\nThe ostensible gadget of tomorrow is a foldable phone with a flexible screen. Samsung is widely expected to unveil its idea for just such a device at a conference on Wednesday. But it was beaten to the punch Monday night by Royole, a startup display and device maker.\n\nBill Liu, CEO of Royole, with a selection of devices that use his company's flexible displays. Troy Wolverton At a small press event, company CEO Bill Liu showed off the FlexPai, which he dubbed the world's first commercially available flexible screen foldable phone. The device, when folded, looks something like a small notebook with a wraparound screen. When opened, it looks like a small tablet.\n\n\"We've been working on this a long time,\" Liu told Business Insider.\n\nRoyole designed the FlexPai to address two significant shortcomings of traditional smartphones \u2014 their screens are fragile, and they're not really big enough for many tasks, such as watching movies or editing documents.\n\nUnlike nearly all smartphones, the FlexPai screen isn't encased in glass. Its display is an OLED screen that's printed on a thin plastic material. The screen is scratch resistant and, because it doesn't use any glass, it's shatter-proof. It can be bent 200,000 times without breaking, Liu said.\n\n\"It's a significant breakthrough,\" he said. He continued: \"Say goodbye to broken screens.\"\n\nThe FlexPai can act as a phone or a tablet\n\nThe FlexPai has a hinge in its middle that allows you to fold it to the point where its two ends touch or unfold it to a 180-degree angle. The hinge is stiff enough that it will maintain any angle in between those two points. So, one thing you can do with it is to fold it part-way to form an \"A\" shape and have it stand up on its two ends.\n\nThe device runs a custom version of Android that Royole calls Water OS that it designed specifically for the FlexPai's flexible screen. One thing it allows you to do is to show a different video on each side of the device's screen when its folded, so you and a friend could potentially watch two different things at the same time.\n\nRead this: This Stanford grad's startup can make screens that are thinner than a sheet of copy paper \u2014 and he's gearing up to take on Samsung and LG in the display market\n\nThe FlexPai supports dual SIM cards. When it's folded in half, you can use the screens on the front and back as, essentially, two different phones, each associated with a different SIM.\n\nThe FlexPai's hinge will maintain any angle between 0 and 180 degrees. Royole But the flexible screen is perhaps most useful when you actually unfold it and you can see the full 7.8\" display in its entirety. In that configuration, it's almost the exact size as the iPad mini. It's only slightly heavier and thicker.\n\nSo, basically, the FlexPai is a miniature tablet that actually fits in your pocket. It will allow users to save money and weight, because they won't need as many devices, Liu said.\n\nYou'll need \"less and less devices to get the same user experience,\" he said.\n\nRoyole is already mass producing the device and taking preorders for it. It plans to start shipping it at the end of December.\n\nThe gadget is pricey and clunky\n\nBut you may want to wait before you buy one.\n\nFor one thing, the device is expensive. It starts at $1,318 for a version with 128 gigabytes of storage. If you want the 256-gigabyte version, it will set you back $1,469. That's more than the priciest iPhone XS Max \u2014 and that model comes with 512 gigabytes of storage.\n\nFor another, Royole doesn't yet have any U.S. carrier partners and isn't really selling the FlexPai to consumers here. Right now, it's targeting consumers in China instead.\n\nUnfolded, the FlexPai is about the same size and shape as Apple's iPad mini. Royole But the gadget has more fundamental problems. It feels like a first-generation device. Although it's small and thin for a tablet, it feels big and clunky when folded in half. That's because it doesn't fold down flat. Instead it has a relatively thick bulge at its hinge. That could be annoying if you're trying to carry it around in your pocket.\n\nRight before Apple introduced that iPad, I met with a small Silicon Valley company that showed off one of the first modern touchscreen tablets. I had been skeptical about tablets before then, but after seeing device \u2014 even in its rough shape \u2014 it was immediately clear why someone would want a gadget like it.\n\nI was hoping to have the same experience with the FlexPai. I've been excited about the coming era of flexible screen devices since the first time I saw a demo of such a display around a decade or so ago. The idea of having a large screen device that you can fit in your pocket or roll up into a pen-like tube is really appealing in theory.\n\nIt feels like a gimmick\n\nBut right now, this flexible screen device feels more like a gimmick than a vision of the future.\n\nI didn't really get to test the device, so I can't say how it performs or what it's like to use on a daily basis. But I'm dubious that in practice its flexible screen feature is really that compelling. Other companies have tried dual-screen phones, and they've never really caught on with consumers. I'm skeptical that people are going to like the trade off of having a thicker gadget in their pocket.\n\nSure, its larger screen can offer a better movie-watching experience. But the display still isn't big enough for the device to replace a laptop or a full-sized tablet. You're not going to want to edit documents or do other work on that sized screen.\n\nSolving the problem of fragile screens is an important advance. But not at a $1,300 price point.\n\nIt was cool to see the FlexPai in person. I'm just hoping that future foldable devices do a better job of living up to the hype.\n\nNow read:", "Amazon is giving Prime members a chance to avoid the chaos of last-minute trips to the grocery store this Thanksgiving.\n\nThe company is offering same-day delivery of groceries from Whole Foods stores until 2 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day, Amazon said Tuesday.\n\nThe service, offered through Amazon Prime Now, will provide delivery in as little as one hour from the time of the order.\n\nShoppers will also have the option to pick up their orders from participating Whole Foods stores.\n\nAmazon started rolling out delivery of Whole Foods groceries earlier this year, after acquiring the grocery chain for $13.7 billion in 2017.\n\nPrime Now delivery is available at Whole Foods stores in 63 cities, and pickup is available in 14 cities.\n\nThe company plans to eventually roll out delivery and pickup to all Whole Foods stores.", "Less than 24 hours after an advertisement that was widely condemned as racist aired during a Sunday Night Football game on NBC, the network issued a sweeping reversal, vowing to immediately remove the ad. NBC cited the ad's \"insensitive\" nature as the reason for its removal.\n\nShortly after, both Fox and Facebook, which aired the ad on their respective platforms, issued similar statements and pulled the ad.\n\nThe 30-second primetime advertisement released by President Trump's campaign attempted to draw a connection between convicted cop killer Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who is now on death row, and the so-called migrant caravan now traveling up through Mexico toward the US border. There is no known connection, and Trump has frequently used the migrant caravan \u2014 a group of several thousand Central American migrants fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries \u2014 as a talking point to stoke fears about immigration in the US.\n\nSo how did the ad pass muster?\n\nFor one, it actually wasn't cleared by all the companies to which it was submitted. CNN, for example, rejected the ad, calling it racist.\n\nNBC, Fox, and Facebook all have their own advertising standards teams that evaluate ads and originally accepted the Trump ad. Federal agencies, which have varying degrees of jurisdiction regulating ads, didn't flag anything as impermissible. It was a public rebuke that prompted a second review and the eventual pulling of the ad.\n\nThe original airing, outcry, and then reversal by the networks show both the difference in rules around enforcement between commercial and political ads, and the growing indication that networks and platforms must appreciate the brand-safety issues that come with political advertisements.\n\nStandards and practices\n\nThe teams at a network or cable company that review an ad for a commercial product and for a political candidate or cause tend to be the same. But the evaluation process is different, according to people familiar with it.\n\n\"I have to believe that in a sane world when a political party or candidate buys time, the assumption is you don't have to scrutinize ads same way you have to if someone is selling something,\" Preston Beckman, former NBC and Fox executive, told Business Insider. \"Political ads are selling policy.\"\n\nAd agencies also note a perceived difference in the way ads are reviewed for commercial products and political issues.\n\n\"The FCC, the FTC, and the FEC leave the American people for dead when it comes to political advertising,\" Sarah O'Leary, lead strategist at Methods & Madness, told Business Insider. \"They allow our public airwaves to be used to lie to us without any regulation.\"\n\nThe FCC administers political programming rules for TV, but it doesn't evaluate messaging in ads. Both the FEC and FTC oversee campaign finance laws, including the disclosure of funds raised to influence federal elections.\n\nThe network is the real evaluation point on ad messaging, according to O'Leary, who owns an ad agency.\n\nIn her experience, the process of getting a commercial ad submitted involves reading product research to understand what facts can be included in an advertisement, multiple layers of review by lawyers, and a final review by networks or cable companies to decide if the ad is legal and fact based, or misleading.\n\n\"The people at the networks know this process inside and out,\" O'Leary said. \"They figured they'd take a chance.\"\n\nMoney is part of the equation, she said, and primetime slots fetch significant ad dollars. Trump spent $2.7 million on national TV ads last week alone, according to iSpot.TV.\n\nThe Trump ad was created by Jamestown Associates, a corporate advertising firm based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with National Media as the ad-buying agency, and aired three times on NBC properties and 14 times on Fox properties over the last week before it was pulled. At the time it was removed, it had been viewed more that 21 million times, according to iSpot.TV.\n\nThe review of a political ad shouldn't be any less stringent than it is for a commercial product, O'Leary said. \"They're selling the most important thing to our society they are selling ideas and principles that are going to determine our government.\"\n\nReputational risk\n\nSince federal agencies don't thoroughly review political ad messages, that leaves the evaluation of whether an ad is appropriate to broadcasters and cable companies. And that determination has proven difficult. NBC, Fox, and Facebook all removed the ad not because it spouted factual inaccuracies, but for less quantifiable reasons.\n\nNBC used the term \"insensitive.\" Facebook said the content was \"sensational.\" In either case, the platforms seemed to designate the ad as a violation of social mores. And that may leave them exposed to a future mishap.\n\nIn the case of the most recent Trump ad that was removed, the damage seems contained.\n\n\"I don't think there's a reputational risk for the network and its other advertisers either way, unless an ad is so egregious that it somehow causes consumers to view other advertisers or the network negatively,\" Brian Wieser, senior analyst Pivotal Research, told Business Insider in an email. \"Advertisers are concerned more about the content they are associated with than the brand company they keep.\"\n\nYouTube is an example of a platform that faced backlash after advertisers noticed their ads running next to offensive or extremist content. It resulted in hundreds of advertisers pulling their ads from YouTube even though ads only rarely ran next to questionable content, Wieser said.\n\nBut advertisers usually only act when there's a direct correlation between content or brand safety and an ad.\n\nTake Facebook's role in the genocide against the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority group. On Monday, Facebook admitted it didn't do enough to prevent its platform being used to incite violence and hate against the Rohingya. But advertisers aren't boycotting Facebook the way they did YouTube.\n\n\"No advertiser has concern at this time because, I think, the connection is too indirect for most consumers to appreciate even if it seems plain as day to someone studying the business closely,\" Wieser said.\n\nIt may take someone putting together a clear argument that resonates with large groups of people for the connection to become more problematic, he said.\n\nBut brand-safety issues for networks and platforms could become more of an issue in the future because of changing expectations of consumers.\n\n\"I think millennials and young people want to align with platforms and brands that are extensions of their values and their principles,\" Joseph Anthony, CEO of New York based advertising firm Hero Group, told Business Insider.\n\n\"I think that the networks are not insulated from that, especially as you see more young people cut the cord and starting to look at more on demand platforms and there are a lot more options out there.\"", "Business Insider\n\nThe Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

People are even saying that he may be willing to prepare initiatives to break up Amazon, because it's too big, it's too successful, it's too dominant in too many sectors, or for varied other reasons, including the fact that he doesn't like the \"Post\". Is this break up scenario something that you take seriously, or do you think it's just a fantasy?\n\nBezos: For me again, this is one of those things where I focus on and ask our teams to focus on what we can control, and I expect \u2014 whether it's the current US administration or any other government agency around the world \u2014 Amazon is now a large corporation and I expect us to be scrutinized. We should be scrutinized. I think all large institutions should be scrutinized and examined. It's reasonable. And one thing to note about is that we have gotten big in absolute terms only very recently. So we've always been growing very fast in percentage terms, but in 2010 just 8 years ago, we had 30,000 employees. So in the last 8 years we've gone from 30,000 employees to 560,000 employees. You know in my mind I'm still delivering the packages to the post office myself. You see what I'm saying? I still have all the memories of hoping that one day we could afford a forklift. So obviously my intellectual brain knows that's just not the case anymore. We have 560,000 employees all over the world. And I know we should be scrutinized and I think it's true that big government institutions should be scrutinized, big non-profit institutions should be scrutinized, big universities should be scrutinized. It just makes sense. And that's, by the way, why the work at the \"Washington Post\" and all other great newspapers around the world do is so important. They are often the ones doing that initial scrutiny, even before the government agencies do.\n\nD\u00f6pfner: The general sentiment concerning the big innovative tech companies has changed. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple \u2014 they used to be seen as the nice guys in T-shirts that are saving the world. Now they are sometimes portrayed as the evil of the world. And the debate about the Big 4 or the Big 5 is heating up: Professors like Scott Galloway and \"The Economist\" are suggesting a split-up, other powerful people like George Soros are giving very critical speeches at Davos, and the EU Commission is taking pretty tough positions here. Do you think that there is a change in the mindset of society, and how should the big tech companies, how should Amazon deal with that?\n\nBezos: I think it's a natural instinct, I think we humans, especially in the western world, and especially inside democracies are wired to be skeptical and mindful of large institutions of any kind. We're skeptical always of our government in the United States, state governments and local governments. I assume it's similar in Germany. It's healthy, because they're big, powerful institutions \u2014 the police, the military, or whatever it is. It doesn't mean you don't trust them, or that they're bad or evil or anything like that. It's just that they have a lot of power and control, and so you want to inspect them. Maybe that's a better word. You kind of want to always be inspecting them. And if you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they need and are going to be inspected. And by the way, it's not personal. I think you can go astray on this if you're the founder of a company \u2014 one of these big tech companies, or any other big institution. If you go astray on this, you might start to take it personally. Like \"Why are you someone inspecting me?\" And I wish that people would just say, \"Yes, it's fine\".\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published on May 4, 2018.", "Two years ago, hackers aligned with the interests of the Russian government created chaos within Hillary Clinton's election campaign when they hacked and stole the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nAttacks like that aren't going to stop anytime soon.

The driver took control of the car and began to merge to the right, when it collided with a Honda Rebel motorcycle that had just begun to pass the Waymo car.\n\nThere were no unusual weather conditions on the clear morning, the report says, and Waymo CEO John Krafcik was quick to pin the crash on human error.\n\nRead more: Waymo is the first company that's allowed to test autonomous cars without a backup driver in California\n\n\"Our review of this incident confirmed that our technology would have avoided the collision by taking a safer course of action,\" he said in a blog post Monday. \"Our simulation shows the self-driving system would have responded to the passenger car by reducing our vehicle's speed, and nudging slightly in our own lane, avoiding a collision.\"\n\nThe incident happened about 10-days before Waymo, a subsidiary of Google-parent Alphabet, won approval from state regulators on October 30 to test cars without human backup drivers on California roads. State law requires permit holders to report any collisions involving autonomous cars to the Department of Motor Vehicles with 10 days as well as an annual report of \"disengagement\" or instances like this crash where a human driver intervenes with the self-driving mode, The Verge reported.\n\nUber, one of Waymo's many self-driving competitors, is also attempting to get back to autonomous testing after one of its cars killed a pedestrian in Arizona over the summer. That incident, the first death attributable to autonomous cars, sent shockwaves through the industry as it races to launch commercial self-driving services.\n\nWaymo plans to launch a ride-hailing service with its autonomous vehicles in Arizona this year, and General Motors is also on track to roll out a similar service next year, Reuters reported.\n\n\"Incidents like this are what motivate all of us at Waymo to work diligently and safely to bring our technology to roads,\" said Waymo's Krafcik, \"because this is the type of situation self-driving vehicles can prevent.\"", "Two years ago, hackers aligned with the interests of the Russian government created chaos within Hillary Clinton's election campaign when they hacked and stole the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nAttacks like that aren't going to stop anytime soon.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nGymshark\n\nBen Francis was 19 years old and driving a car that smelled permanently like pizza. He was working as a delivery person at the time, just as he decided to found a fitness apparel company called Gymshark out of his mom's garage.\n\nThat was 2012. In 2018, Gymshark has reportedly generated $128 million in annual sales, and become one of the fastest growing companies in the world.\n\nThe UK startup has a few key tools to thank for its explosive success: an early trade show that sent daily sales from $400 to $42,000 in a single day, and a masterful use of social media.\n\nGymshark's main Instagram \u2014 which, as of November 2018, has 2.5 million followers \u2014 is flush with Gymshark-clad celebrity trainers (including Kim Kardashian's trainer Melissa Alcantara), big-time athletes, and fitness icons with millions of social media followers on their own. The company's Facebook page has 1.5 million likes. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg reportedly even used the company as a model example of European brands excelling at growing a business on the platform.\n\nBut Gymshark isn't just successful because it has figured out social media. It is successful because it is one of few companies to accurately understand \"gym culture\" \u2014 and to then make spot-on products for gym-goers.\n\nYoung gym-goers want to look and feel good going to the gym. They want functional gym clothes \u2014 sweat-wicking, flexible, and durable \u2014 that perform well, and, yes, look really good on them. Gymshark understood that, and it delivered.\n\nGymshark founder Ben Francis initially designed these gym clothes to be antithetical to the binary choice of neon or baggy clothes bodybuilders used to wear to the gym. Gymshark\n\nHere's an example. Probably the most iconic Gymshark item is their $38 Flex Leggings (seen above). They're breathable, flexible, and no-nonsense \u2014 the high waistband is compressive, slimming, and supportive, and the seamless construction moves with you without complaint. But they're also designed with a none-too-subtle hand to be extremely flattering and \"bum-contouring.\" The color contouring is overt in light colors, and modest enough to go almost unnoticed in the darker colorways.\n\nThe clothes are also unusually affordable. For staples like leggings, shoppers can pay as little as $35. At other brands with comparably cult-like followings, the same shoppers might pay closer to $100. Best-selling shirts go for as little as $25. Fabric compositions may not be the most elegant in the game, but they'll suffice for the average gym-goer \u2014 especially for the frequent athlete who can't spend $50 on shirts they need in bulk. Plus, they look really good.\n\nGymshark does all the trends you want in a uniquely masterful way and at an affordable price. The men's $45 Taped Joggers have tapered legs but an overall slouchy fit so your shape is discernible.

The usual life-extension suspects include pricey pills and supplements; the peculiar involve infusions of young blood and chambers pumped with sub-zero temperatures.\n\nThen there's science. And one scientific factor that has long been presumed to dictate much of how long we live is our DNA. For decades, it was assumed that the genes we inherit from our parents explain anywhere from 15% to 30% of the variations in longevity that are observed between people.\n\nBut a new study that came from quiet collaboration between genetics company Ancestry and a Google life-extension spinoff called Calico suggests that our genes play less of a role in our lifespan than we thought.\n\nInstead, traits and behaviors that include everything from diet and exercise to friendliness appears to play a strong role in longevity. Surprisingly, we still pass these traits on through generations \u2014 mostly by picking partners who look and act like us, the researchers report.\n\nIn essence, the findings suggest that people effectively transfer longevity from one generation to the next much in the same way that wealth and socioeconomic status are passed from parents to children: by choosing partners with attitudes and attributes that mirror our own, regardless of how different their DNA may be.\n\nPicking partners who act and think like us\n\nseyfettin dincturk / Unsplash\n\nFor decades, researchers studying longevity and genetics had estimated that the genes we inherit from our parents play a significant role in determining how long we live. Previous studies suggested that genes account for as much as 30% of the total variability in lifespan between individuals.\n\nBut the new study from Ancestry and Calico indicates that our DNA may be much less important in determining longevity than traits and behaviors like diet, exercise, and personality. After looking at data from more than 54 million family trees and the birth and death information for over 400 million individuals, the researchers concluded that our DNA accounts for less than 10% of lifespan variability.\n\nInstead, we pass on longevity through generations by choosing partners whose attitudes and attributes look much like our own. In research parlance, that's known as \"assortative mating.\"\n\n\"The true heritability of human longevity or birth cohorts across the 1800s and early 1900s was well below 10%, and ... has been generally overestimated due to the effect of assortative mating,\" the scientists wrote.\n\nPut another way, we tend to pick partners with attitudes and attributes \u2014 from eating and exercising to friendliness \u2014 that mirror our own. And as a result, we tend to live similar amounts of time, and have children who do as well.\n\nHow friendly we are and how often we work out may play a stronger role in our longevity than our DNA\n\nShutterstock\n\nPrevious studies shed light on how important lifestyle factors are when it comes to how long we live. In a recent study published in the journal Circulation, for example, scientists pinpointed five lifestyle factors that appear to be linked with a significantly longer lifespan, judging by the outcomes of two long-term studies that involved about 123,000 adults.\n\nPeople in the study who lived long lives tended to:\n\nDo at least 30 minutes of cardio exercise every day.\n\nEat a Mediterranean diet.\n\nNever smoke.\n\nStick to a healthy body weight.\n\nDrink no more than 1-2 alcoholic beverages a day.\n\nAs part of several other recent studies, scientists have uncovered a handful of personality traits that also appear to be strongly linked to longer-than-average lives. They include:\n\nConscientiousness, or being less likely to take risks but more likely to be thorough and efficient.\n\nOpenness, or being willing to lend an ear to new and different ideas and concepts.\n\nEmotional stability.\n\nFriendliness.\n\nBeing able to openly express one's feelings.\n\nTaken together, the findings suggest that how long we live may be less a matter of what we're born with than the circumstances in which we live and the choices that we make. Those choices, as the Ancestry and Google researchers acknowledge in their new paper, tend to be based on everything from social status to wealth and then, just like genetics, passed on from one generation to the next.", "Ships from the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and other cruiser-destroyer units based at Naval Station Norfolk sailed into the Atlantic earlier this month for the East Coast's first Surface Warfare Advanced Tactical Training, or SWATT, exercise with a carrier group.\n\nSWATT is a relatively new addition to the Navy's training repertoire, and it comes a years-long period in which the force was focused on anti-piracy and other high-sea policing operations rather than on a high-end fight against a sophisticated adversary.\n\nSWATT exercises are led by warfare-tactics instructors from the Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center, or SMWDC, which was set up in 2015 to help the Navy develop experts in surface warfare operations.\n\nThe exercises are meant to take place in between ship exercises where a crew trains and qualifies for its missions and advanced exercises where an entire amphibious ready group or carrier strike group gathers to train.\n\nCulinary Specialist First Class Marcus Madison stands watch on the bridge of the guided-missile destroyer USS Nitze, November 3, 2018.

We're talking about food videos here \u2014 quality is of prime importance. And this video in particular, a crucial video about making Thanksgiving turkey just weeks before the big day, was really rough.\n\nTake a look:\n\nWhat could've happened? A change in cameras? A new video producer who made a mistake?\n\nDigging into the video's information section unearthed an answer: The video was inexplicably shot on Google's new Pixel 3 smartphone instead of a traditional camera. Google tells us it's part of an ongoing sponsorship paid for by Google with Bon App\u00e9tit's parent company, Cond\u00e9 Nast. We asked representatives for Cond\u00e9 Nast about how the show is normally shot, and were told, \"We use a variety of cameras that shoot in 4K.\"\n\nThe video is intended as a demonstration of the Pixel 3's quality. Instead, it serves to highlight how far smartphone cameras still have to go to catch up with traditional video equipment.\n\nLook no further than this other recent video from Bon App\u00e9tit to see for yourself:\n\nSame guy (Bon App\u00e9tit senior food editor Andy Baraghani), same YouTube video series (\"Andy Makes...\"), but a massive difference in quality.\n\nThat's because the latter video was shot with BA's usual video equipment \u2014 dedicated camera bodies with swappable lenses \u2014 rather than a smartphone.\n\nThe video shot on the Pixel 3 looks like a home movie.\n\nThe framerate is jittery, and the focus is all over the place, and there's a lot of noise in the image. It looks amateur, like it was shot on a phone, whereas the latter video has a stable framerate with clear detail. The second video looks professional, while the first video \u2014 shot on Pixel 3 by professional video producers \u2014 looks distinctly unprofessional.\n\nThe turkey looks shiny and plastic. The colors are sharp.

Great turkey tho!\" another reads. \"Please do not use a Pixel 3 to make videos. The quality of picture is not up to par with your other videos,\" says yet another. They go on and on like that.\n\nNone of this is to say that the Pixel 3 isn't capable of capturing attractive video; it absolutely can, and that's particularly true when it comes to home videos. But the work that Bon App\u00e9tit's video production department does is pro-level video work, and it's clear that the Pixel 3 \u2014 the best smartphone camera out there \u2014 is nowhere near capable of matching that level of work.\n\nRather than advertise the Pixel 3's ability, the video demonstrates just how far we still have to go with video captured on even the best smartphones.", "The cost of getting a four-year undergraduate degree is more expensive than ever.

A legalization measure failed in North Dakota.\n\nA total of 33 states now have some measure of legal access to marijuana.\n\nMarijuana legalization is sweeping the US: In June, Oklahoma voted to legalize medical marijuana, joining the number of other states that already have medical marijuana laws on the books. Ten other states, including California and Colorado, have legalized the possession and sale of marijuana to all adults over the age of 21.\n\nIt's also one of the few hot-button topics with widespread support.

Samsung / Web Summit /Twitter screengrab\n\nTo give you an idea of just how far we are already into this future, Sohn told the Web Summit conference in Lisbon that there are already 340 trillion-trillion-trillion IP addresses on the planet (that's 10 to the power of 37), mostly inside connected devices that already have the ability to talk to each other. For scale, there are only 100 billion stars in the galaxy, and only 100 billion neurones in the average human brain.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider after his speech, we put it to Sohn that there was a lot about his vision that was troubling.\n\n\"I worry about that,\" he told us. \"That's why I brought up these questions of ethics. I mean, I think we should really worry about ethics. What is right? What is wrong? That's why I made a comment, we've got to be principle-driven. And the research? Great. But research for purpose, not for using that data to take advantage of all human beings out there.\"\n\nSamsung envisions a sensor-pervasive world that tracks everything you do. Samsung / Web Summit / Twitter screengrab\n\nIn his keynote, Sohn had described the coming explosion in AI-driven data as an \"opportunity.\" \"It's not just for China, not just for the Americans, data is a global opportunity,\" he said. \"There are many opportunities to disrupt the world here.\"\n\nBut there are also many opportunities to invade people's privacy, or to curtail their rights based on the data stored about them. In China, for instance, the government has started using citizens' credit scores against them, by restricting the travel of people with low scores, reducing their internet access and preventing their children from attending the best schools.\n\n\"So, I don't agree with Chinese support for social score, I think that's a problem,\" Sohn told Business Insider. \"And I think we also have to be very careful of how the data is shared, even by Google link, any big platform companies, we should be mindful of that because power in the hands of [people with] wrong purpose can create abuse. I'm not a politician. But as technologists I think we need to be more truly aware of what we are doing. It's more education [needed] right there.\"\n\nHe quickly added, \"Your data on a Samsung phone stays with Samsung on your phone, Samsung doesn't have any access to your phone.\"\n\nSohn said he is really hoping that AI and big data will be used to improve everyone's health. In his speech, he envisioned DNA data being widely available for research and AI. \"We need to have the genome data that's available,\" he said, so that companies can begin \"creating a unified database that can be able to help us from, genomes to phenomes, and other data types.\"\n\nDNA and genomics will be a big part of it. Samsung / Web Summit / Twitter screengrab\n\n\"Genomics is the bridge,\" he said. With \"information around our blood, we will be able to make correlations with different diseases, diagnosis, prognoses and prevention over time.\"\n\nBusiness Insider asked him to expand on that in a conversation backstage. \"I think we only know about 7 to 8 percent of our body, from a medical [standpoint], so I am hoping we create more, and learn what we don't know. Through that process we can have a better correlation between diseases ... so that's what I really meant. How do you do that? Well you start with the data, and you start with AI, because one of the things with AI is, you make connections where you'd never expect it.\"\n\nBut he agreed that the process could be open to abuse. In his speech he also warned, \"We have issues that we really have to think through ... the ethics of AI.\"", "Victoria's Secret's annual fashion show is scheduled for Thursday in New York and will be on TV in December.\n\nBut Jefferies analysts said the show won't have much of an audience.\n\n\"VS pricing power has been permanently impaired,\" said Jefferies analyst Randal Konik, a long-time bear on Victoria's Secret and its owner L Brands.\n\nWatch L Brands trade live.\n\nVictoria's Secret upcoming fashion show will be a reminder of how unpopular the brand is, Jefferies says.\n\nThe lingerie retailer's annual fashion show is set for Thursday in New York, where the show firstly started in 1995.

Whether that means scoring your dream job or internship after school, meticulously decorating your one-bedroom apartment, or crafting Michelin-star-level meals at home, these expectations seem designed for us to fall short of them.\n\nWhile I can by no means claim to have ticked off all these boxes, I have developed a way to make at least one of those tasks easier for myself: grocery shopping.\n\nI actually enjoy grocery stores\u2014 the kitschy holiday displays and the free samples, especially \u2014 but more often than not I find myself overwhelmed by the number of options presented in their aisles. When I first started grocery shopping for myself, my solution to this paralysis was to stick to buying staple items I knew I could use for several meals. This meant buying items like eggs, beans, pasta, and spinach every week.\n\nEspecially in college, these items made for quick and fairly nutritious meals. However, eating the same items again and again began to make cooking not only boring, but a chore.\n\nI tried the opposite approach, too, searching for hours through Instagram and compiling an endless list of dishes I'd like to make. But deciding which of the hundreds to make on any given night became its own challenge, and creating a succinct grocery list that could encompass all those meals seemed impossible.\n\nIt occurred to me recently that I had completely overlooked a tactic that had been working for restaurants for decades: a menu.\n\nI decided to sit down and create my own personal menu, tailored to meals I already enjoyed and knew how to make. Breaking up the list into categories like soups, fish, meat, and vegetarian helped me streamline the process even further, and options I'd forgotten I loved - like butternut squash soup or fish tacos \u2014 started to easily fall into place. By the end, the list contained about 15 to 20 reliable meals that I knew I'd enjoy cooking and eating.\n\nFrom this \"master\" list, I can create a weekly menu before every grocery store trip. That way, I only put items on my shopping list that I know I'll use during the week, eliminating the guilt of watching produce slowly go bad or bags of rice grow dusty at the back of my cabinet.\n\nThe weekly menu also gets at the root of my cooking fears: variety and indecision.\n\nBecause my master list has almost two dozen options itself, that means that I can now go months without repeating a weekly menu. Not only that, but by picking items from each of my categories, I can assure that indecisiveness won't leave me bogged down with all salads one week or all pastas the next, and that I'll have a variety of textures and flavors each night.\n\nTo hammer this newfound order home even further, I've begun writing my menus down weekly on a peel-and-stick chalkboard. While I've never been one to scrapbook or bullet journal, this creative ritual gives me a moment of reflection to concentrate on not only the logistics of food shopping and preparing but also the adventure, passion, and memories that go into it.\n\nI may still have a long way to go before becoming a \"successful adult,\" but at least I can depend on some quality time each night between me, my onions, and my frying pan.", "Last month, Google rolled out a new time-saving shortcut for anyone who spends a lot of time in Google Docs.\n\nTo open a new, blank document \u2014 or spreadsheet, or presentation \u2014 all you have to do is go to one of Google's handy new URLs.\n\nSo if you want to start a new document, you just have to type \"doc.new\" into your browser.\n\nHere's an incomplete list of the new shortcuts:\n\nhttp://doc.new \u2014 opens new Google document\n\n\u2014 opens new Google document http://sheets.new \u2014 opens new Google Sheets spreadsheet\n\n\u2014 opens new Google Sheets spreadsheet http://deck.new \u2014 opens new Google presentation\n\n\u2014 opens new Google presentation http://site.new \u2014 creates new Google sites website\n\n\u2014 creates new Google sites website http://form.new\u2014 creates new Google form\n\nThis might seem like a minor new shortcut, but a lot of people are pumped.\n\nIf you want to take this shortcut to the next level, you can create bookmarks for these new sites in your bookmarks bar.\n\nIn Chrome, simply go to Bookmarks > Bookmarks Manager > Add new bookmark.\n\nThen create a bookmark with these URLs and whatever you might want to call the shortcut, like this:\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nThen you can put the shortcuts in your Bookmarks Bar for easy access, like this:", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider may receive a commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network.\n\nChase Ink Business Preferred and Wells Fargo Propel are two of the best options if you're looking for cell phone protection through your credit card. The Points Guy\n\nThere are all kinds of credit cards out there \u2014 store cards, travel cards, transferable points cards, and more.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing the best card for you, there are a lot of different card benefits to consider. Most of us have gotten pretty used to comparing cash-back rates and deciding whether we want a card that's geared toward travel or not.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of other really valuable benefits that some credit card issuers are starting to add to their cards, and they're definitely not benefits you want to ignore. Some of these benefits can save you hundreds of dollars per year!\n\nHere are a few great benefits that you might not know about and cards that come with them.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically,treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\n1. Trip delay and cancellation insurance\n\nMany credit cards with an annual fee that are issued by Citi and Chase come with trip delay and cancellation insurance.\n\nDepending on what card you have, the point at which the coverage will kick in varies. For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card requires a delay of at least 12 hours while the Chase Sapphire Reserve only needs a six-hour delay. The Citi Prestige Card, which is currently closed to new applicants, also covers delays starting at six hours, but generally does not offer coverage for missed connections. Most cards offer up to $500 per passenger in trip delay coverage.\n\nIf you have to cancel a trip for covered reasons, your credit card may also reimburse you for nonrefundable expenses related to your trip. All of the cards mentioned above have some sort of trip cancellation insurance, but the terms vary slightly from card to card.\n\nIn order to have the trip delay and cancellation insurance apply, you must have paid for your airfare with your credit card and fill out a claim if you need to use your insurance.\n\nNotably, American Express does not have impressive benefits when it comes to trip delays and cancellations, so if this is a benefit that would be useful to you, you may not want to rely on an American Express card for your travel purchases.\n\nRead more: The best credit card rewards, bonuses, and perks\n\n2. Lost and delayed baggage insurance\n\nSimilar to the trip delay and cancellation insurance, a number of cards also cover you if your bags are lost or delayed when you travel. Again, terms vary somewhat, but most cards with this benefit provide up to $100 per day for a maximum of five days if your bag is delayed or will reimburse up to $500 for a lost bag. Some of the best cards with these benefits include the Chase Sapphire Preferred and Chase Sapphire Reserve.\n\n3. Airport lounge access\n\nWhen it comes to lounge access, things get a little more crazy because it really depends what type of lounge access you are after. Ultra-premium credit cards from all major issuers offer a Priority Pass membership that will get you into over 1,000 lounges and restaurants world wide. The Chase Sapphire Reserve, The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express, and the Hilton Honors Aspire Card from American Express are a few that come with this benefit. Even the Hilton Honors American Express Ascend Card offers you 10 Priority Pass lounge visits per year.\n\nIf you're more interested in lounge membership with a specific airline, your options look a little different. You can get the United MileagePlus Club Card to get access to United Clubs, the Citi/AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard to get access to American Airlines Admirals Clubs, or the Delta Reserve\u00ae Credit Card from American Express to get access to Delta SkyClubs. Additionally, AmEx Platinum cardholders can get into Delta SkyClubs when traveling on Delta same-day, but with no free guests.\n\nThose who have the AmEx Platinum can also get into American Express Centurion Lounges.\n\n4. Cell phone insurance\n\nWhy bother paying extra for cell phone insurance when you might be able to get it as an included benefit with a credit card? There are a handful of credit cards that offer cell phone insurance, and the benefits and requirements vary slightly depending on the card (just like all of the other benefits). The Chase Ink Business Preferred Credit Card and the Wells Fargo Propel American Express\u00ae Card are two of the best options if you're looking for cell phone protection through your credit card.\n\nThe Ink Business Preferred has protection that is subject to a $100 deductible and you can have a maximum of three claims per calendar year with a maximum benefit of $600 per claim and $1,800 per year. You must pay your cell phone bill each month with this card in order to have the insurance benefit apply.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Propel also requires that you pay your monthly bill with the card each month and will cover up to $600 per claim, but with only a $25 deductible. You can max a maximum of two claims per year, but notably, the coverage will not cover lost phones. This is still a pretty great deal for a card without an annual fee.\n\n5. Purchase protection and return protection\n\nTwo final related benefits that may really come in handy are purchase protection and return protection. Unfortunately, many cards have removed these benefits in the past year, but some cards still have them.\n\nPurchase protection covers you if something happens to a purchase you make within a specific time period after purchasing. Return protection allows you to make returns of items for a specific time period even if the store you made the purchase from won't take the item back.\n\nAgain, exact terms of these benefits vary, so you will want to look up the requirements and limits associated with your card or the card you are thinking about getting. A couple of good cards with purchase protection are the United MileagePlus Club Card, American Express\u00ae Gold Card, and Citi Double Cash Card.\n\nSome good options for return protection include the Chase Sapphire Reserve, the AmEx Platinum, and the Citi Double Cash Card.\n\nThere are a ton of other cards that have these benefits though, so don't despair if your card isn't listed here!\n\nThe bottom line\n\nCertain benefits of cards like cash back or points are really easy to consider, but there are a ton of other super-valuable benefits that your card could offer that you might not know about. Purchase protection, travel insurance, and lounge access are just a few of the benefits that you might be missing out on. Even if you don't have a card with any of these benefits, you may want to look into a card that does have them because it could save you in the long run.", "Seven members of the Ottawa Senators were secretly recorded in an Uber criticizing the team's performance and assistant coach Martin Raymond.\n\nAccording to The Ottawa Citizen, the video appeared to be taped while the team was on a road swing going through Phoenix, Arizona. A camera on the rearview mirror filmed the players. The footage was later uploaded to the internet before being taken down.\n\nIn the video, the players mock the team's penalty-killing abilities and the work done by Raymond, who coaches penalty-killing and previously coached power plays.\n\nNone of the players appeared to know they were being filmed.\n\n\"Marty Raymond, the only coach in NHL history to have the worst power-play and the worst PK within a calendar year,\" forward Matt Duchene said.\n\n\"Do you notice that when [Raymond] runs the video, if you actually do pay attention, he doesn't ever teach you anything?\" defenseman Chris Wideman said.\n\nAt one point, the driver asked what team the players are on. Wideman told him they're on the Senators, then said, \"If you can tell, we're really pleased with [their PKs].\"\n\nLater, Duchene said: \"We don't change anything, ever. So why do we even have a meeting? I haven't paid attention in three weeks.\"\n\nThe Senators are 5-6 and rank towards the bottom of the league in penalty-killing and shots allowed per game.\n\nThe players in the video released a statement apologizing for the incident.\n\n\"We want to apologize publicly to Marty Raymond, our teammates, and coaches for our comments in Phoenix Arizona on October 29. Our private conversation was recorded without our knowledge or consent. We're passionate about our team, and focusing on growing together.

This is an important learning experience, and we will do better.\"\n\nThe team also released a statement standing by Raymond.\n\n\"Nothing is more important to us during this rebuild than making sure our players and coaches are fully committed to our plan, our values and our system of play. We have every confidence in Marty Raymond's coaching; in the effort and determination of our team; and in the sincerity of our players' apology. We are now treating this as a team matter, and will be making no further comment to the media.\"\n\nWatch the video below:", "This looks to be the year of acquisitions of open source software companies, and $58 billion IT infrastructure company VMware \u2014 a subsidiary of Dell \u2014 just announced another one on Tuesday.\n\nAt its VMworld Europe event, VMware announced it would acquire Heptio, which builds its own version of Kubernetes, a quickly-growing cloud computing platform that developers have grown to love. Although VMware hasn't announced the terms of the deal, it expects to close the deal in VMware's fiscal Q4 2019.\n\nKubernetes is an open source cloud project, originally created by Google to manage its server infrastructure and containers. Heptio's products make it easier for customers to manage multiple clouds, so customers can use platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and their own servers, without massively re-architecting their software infrastructure.\n\n\"Kubernetes is emerging as an open framework for multi-cloud infrastructure that enables enterprise organizations to run modern applications,\" Paul Fazzone, senior vice president and general manager of the Cloud Native Apps Business Unit at VMware, said in a statement.\n\nNotably, Heptio was cofounded by Joe Beda and Craig McLuckie, two of the original co-creators of Kubernetes at Google. In 2016, the duo departed Google to found Heptio, with an eye towards making Kubernetes easier for developers to use. Heptio also provides training, support and professional services to help customers use Kubernetes.\n\n\"Kubernetes started at Google years ago, and Google has a lot of smart people,\" said Ping Li, general partner at Accel, where Beda was once an Entrepreneur-in-Residence. \"[Kubernetes] has become incredibly popular. It has become that layer on top of the cloud providers and technology that everyone seems to gravitate towards.\"\n\nVMware and the software company Pivotal \u2014 another Dell-owned public company \u2014 have previously delivered the Kubernetes-powered Pivotal Container Service. Kubernetes is already mega-popular among developers, but with this acquisition, VMware looks to establish even more of a leadership position with Kubernetes-based technology.\n\nThis follows a trend in acquisitions of open source-powered companies this year, notably seen with Microsoft acquiring GitHub and IBM's recent announcement that it plans to acquire Red Hat. In fact, Red Hat itself also offers Kubernetes-based technology as a part of its OpenShift application platform.\n\n\"VMware's interest in Heptio is a recognition that there is so much innovation happening in open source,\" Craig McLuckie, CEO and co-founder of Heptio, said in a statement. \"We are jointly committed to contribute even more to the community\u2014resources, ideas and support.\"\n\nRead more: VMware's CEO has a vision that should terrify the security industry: 'Start getting rid of products'\n\nThe Linux Foundation and Docker both showed support for this proposed acquisition, as it shows VMware's continued engagement with the open source community.\n\n\"We are all happy for their success,\" Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, said in a statement. \"VMware has also steadily upped its investment and engagement with open source through the years. Following so closely after the IBM/Red Hat news, this is yet another example of a large company that believes open source and open cloud computing are critical to future growth.\"\n\n\"Following IBM's proposed acquisition of Red Hat, it's clear that other companies are reacting and looking for acquisition strategies to assemble a platform capable of managing containerized applications across multi-cloud environments,\" Neil Charney, CMO of Docker, said in a statement.", "It's beginning to feel like there are too many good teams in the NFL.\n\nJust last week, we pushed the idea that four teams stood above the rest: the L.A.

How can we overlook the 6-2 Carolina Panthers, who have won three in a row and are clicking on offense in a way we haven't seen in recent years? What about the L.A. Chargers, who are 13-3 over their last 16 games and riding a five-game winning streak? How about the Pittsburgh Steelers, who have turned things around and won four straight?\n\nThat doesn't even include some other teams who are putting up impressive performances when we look a little closer. The Minnesota Vikings have been considered a disappointment, but outside of one ugly, baffling loss to the Buffalo Bills, they've only been beaten by the Saints and Rams. That's not so bad. Or what about the 6-3 Houston Texans, riding a six-game winning streak and on pace to win their division easily?\n\nIt's a bit too early to expand our top four teams, but as we enter the second half of the year, there are going to be some white-knuckle playoff races.\n\nCheck out where all 32 teams stand going into Week 10 below:", "Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nNarrator: Have you ever tried typing something but your phone keeps changing it to something else? This ducking keyboard can be so frustrating! It can seem like autocorrect is working against you instead of helping you. But the iPhone has had autocorrect for over 10 years. Why does it still suck? Whether you're on iPhone or Android, using the default keyboard or a third-party app you deal with autocorrect every single day. Usually, it works great but sometimes it completely refuses to understand what you typed. To figure out what's happening we have to understand how autocorrect works. When you type something on a phone there's a lot of work going on in the background. The phone analyzes your input and compares it to stored dictionaries and language models. The phone then tries to correctly interpret the word or phrase you're trying to type. So when you type \"fopd\" your phone changes it to \"food\" because \"fopd\" isn't a word but it's only one letter away from \"food.\" But not every example is this obvious.\n\nKen Kocienda: The vowels U, I, and O are very close to each other so a word like put, pit, and pot those, those were real challenges.\n\nNarrator: That's Ken Kocienda, he's one of the people who developed autocorrect for Apple. We spoke with Ken to find out what's happening inside of autocorrect.\n\nKen Kocienda: My job was to come up with a way to make speedy and accurate typing possible on a sheet of glass.\n\nNarrator: The hardest part isn't correcting spelling or grammar, it's interpreting what you meant to say from what you wrote. And autocorrect is actually pretty good at this but users tend to notice autocorrect only when it makes mistakes.\n\nKen Kocienda: If it does what it's supposed to do 19 times and then that 20th time it makes a mistake that is either distracting or embarrassing, that one mistake wipes out the positive feelings that people have for the 19 times where it just worked.\n\nNarrator: This is especially obvious when autocorrect leads to unwanted changes. Sometimes it can feel like you're fighting against your keyboard.\n\nKen Kocienda: Mostly people complain about how autocorrect gets in the way of their swearing. The ducking keyboard.\n\nNarrator: The iPhone keyboard will let you swear, it just wants to prevent you from accidentally sending a word that you didn't mean to send. It might seem like you're always wrestling with autocorrect, but you can take control of your dictionary. On iOS go into Settings, General, Keyboard, and then tap \"Add Shortcut\" or \"Text Replacement.\" Here you can add a new word or a shortcut that fills in a word when you type a few letters. You can Google around to find out how to add words to the various versions of Android or third-party keyboards. So, you might still think autocorrect sucks but it's actually gotten a lot better since version one and some developers have introduced new tools like swipe to type to make typing on a smartphone easier. In the future, machine learning might create an autocorrect that's more accurate than ever but whatever the technology is we can't lose sight of the original goal of autocorrect.\n\nKen Kocienda: The goal that I like to think about for the product is for it to have the software melt away. Autocorrection is not supposed to be glamorous, right? It's just supposed to be useful.\n\nNarrator: Autocorrect is far from perfect but our messages would look a lot worse without it.", "Sergey Ivanutin / Strelka Institute/Flickr\n\nAsking your boss for a raise can be intimidating enough.\n\nBut at one Florida-based company, your boss isn't the only person who gets a say \u2014 the whole office gets a vote.\n\nSince it was founded in 2003, travel insurance site Squaremouth has had a policy of peer-reviewed raises, according to a CNN profile of the company by Kathryn Vasel. That means that when employees feel they deserve a raise, they bring it before their coworkers at a company-wide meeting.\n\nEmployees typically have until the end of the day to make a decision and must provide their reasoning for their votes, according to CNN. If a majority of the company votes in favor of the raise, then it gets approved. None of the votes are anonymous.\n\nRead more:A step-by-step guide to asking for a raise\n\nCEO Chris Harvey said the policy is in place to increase transparency in the workplace.\n\n\"There is no stopgap,\" Harvey told CNN. \"We rely on everyone having enough information and being intelligent enough that they will vote for an acceptable raise.\"\n\nAccording to the article, the majority of raise requests get approved: 39 out of 41 since 2010, the company said. Additionally, managers have the power to award smaller merit-based raises, and employees automatically receive an annual raise to adjust for cost of living.\n\n\"I remember my boss telling me he wanted to pay me more, but he got hit with so much red tape.

Out of 165 people surveyed who had subscribed to MoviePass in the last six months, 56% said they were either extremely or moderately satisfied with the service, while 18% had a neutral reaction.\n\nAs MoviePass has struggled to gain financial footing in recent months, it has rolled out new features designed to control its cash burn. The main ones still in a effect are a cap at three movies per month, and limitations on which movies (and showtimes) subscribers can go to.\n\n\"There are always movies that I want to see,\" one respondent said. \"I feel it is a great value for the amount paid. Other friends have purchased based on my great experience.\"\n\nAnother, however, said they had become disenchanted with MoviePass: \"It was amazing at first but became too restrictive at the end.\"\n\nDespite laments about the product going downhill, these survey results are a far cry from the doomsday scenario social media would suggest was happening to MoviePass.\n\nRead more: MoviePass competitor Sinemia has a new cheaper 'weekday-only' plan starting at $3.99 per month.\n\nThat said, 18% of 119 current MoviePass subscribers surveyed said they had plans to cancel, with 6% saying they already tried but were not allowed to (a common complaint Business Insider has heard).\n\nOf 46 previous MoviePass subscribers who had already canceled, 54% cited the limitations on which movies they could go to as a reason.\n\n\"They changed it too much and you basically couldn't see movies when you wanted to which is why I stopped subscribing,\" one respondent said.\n\nMoviePass announced in June that it had passed three million subscribers, so even with a double-digit drop the company would still have a sizeable user base.\n\nBut the more proximate worry for MoviePass and its parent company, Helios and Matheson Analytics, is angry shareholders, some of whom have seen the value of their stakes drop over 99% in recent months.\n\nHelios has twice delayed a crucial shareholders meeting where it will ask for authorization to perform a 1-for-500 reverse stock split to avoid getting delisted from the Nasdaq exchange.

Amazon, AT&T, Verizon, and Disney have all made moves to counter the Facebook-Google duopoly, and will vie for their position with their technology stacks, distribution, and content capabilities.\n\n\"Google and Facebook will start to feel this competition in 2019, and we will be watching to see if cracks begin forming in the foundation of the empires they have both built,\" Colburn said.\n\nHere are the five events that will reshape media ad advertising in 2o19, according to Forrester:\n\nAT&T will buy Roku to become a TV platform\n\nBy snapping up Time Warner, AppNexus, and DirectTV, AT&T pieced together the content, technology, and distribution pipes needed to challenge the duopoly as well as rival TV networks. But to truly become a viable threat, it needs to become a bigger part of consumers' daily lives.\n\nAT&T will do that by acquiring Roku, Forrester predicts, as the acquisition will not only give it tremendous scale but also help it complement its new targeted advertising division, Xandr.\n\n\"Buying Roku is a natural next step for AT&T after their acquisitions of Time Warner and AppNexus in 2018,\" Colburn said.\n\nInstagram and WhatsApp will save Facebook\n\nFrom the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, to a cyber attack that impacted nearly 50 million user accounts, Facebook battled a spate of brand crises in 2018, severely impacting its brand reputation.\n\nThe platform isn't growing at the pace it once was either, with monthly active users (MAUs) being flat in the second quarter of 2018 in North America and falling in Europe, coupled with decelerated ad revenue growth.\n\nBut the company can't be dismissed yet, according to Forrester, with Instagram quickly emerging as its shining star with more than 1 billion monthly active users and a user growth rate outpacing Facebook's.\n\n\"In 2019, we predict that Instagram will continue to pick up the slack while Facebook hones in on Messenger and WhatsApp to accelerate user and ad revenue growth for the parent company,\" the authors of the report write. \"Messaging apps for one-on-one consumer interactions and advertising are still uncertain territory for brands but are increasing in interest \u2014 and Facebook will deliver.\"\n\nBlockchain will become mainstream in advertising\n\nFrom ads that get clicked on by bots, to hidden fees and an overall lack of transparency, the digital ad ecosystem has been under fire of late on a number of fronts.\n\nA number of big brands and marketers are attempting to fight that by betting on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin.\n\nBy the end of 2019, advertisers will be able to follow every dollar that leaves their coffers, Forrester predicts, and be able to see exactly how much they are paying, and for what, at every step of the way.\n\nBig brands like Kellogg's, Kimberly-Clark, Pfizer, and Unilever are already leading the way by participating in a blockchain pilot program powered by IBM and Media Ocean that aims to bring complete transparency to media-buying.\n\n\"Blockchain will make an important entrance in 2018, by exposing the value and costs of all the steps in the media supply chain,\" Colburn said. \"But it will be a couple of years before blockchain is ready to make the impact that marketers are really looking for - impression-level reporting that will expose advertising fraud.\"\n\nHyper-targeting will give way to hyper-focus on creative\n\nThe rollout of GDPR sent many advertisers scrambling, casting a shadow on a future where they could hyper-target media, especially those brands lacking in first-party customer data.\n\nBut as the use of consumer data comes under increasing scrutiny, the focus, at least for advertisers, will turn back to powerful creative, according to Forrester.\n\nIn 2019, advertisers will start turning to creative adtech vendors like RevJet and Thunder to create contextually relevant ads cued by both first-party data, as well as data around the weather, time of day, and live events.\n\nCreative adtech will also improve ad quality and cross-channel storytelling. More brands will refrain from stalking consumers around the internet with cheap-looking, product-focused display ads, according to Forrester.\n\n\"Despite what marketers and advertisers think, the media industry isn't nearly as customer-obsessed as it could be,\" Colburn said. \"I am most bullish on advertisers trading in their hyper-targeting obsession for a hyper-focus on creative in advertising - it will improve both the customer experience and overall results.\"\n\nA bidding war will break out for LiveRamp, and Google will take the cake\n\nSeveral players - from Adobe and Salesforce to ad holding companies - have had their eyes on LiveRamp since Axciom's data marketing services were acquired by IPG.\n\nThe competition is only going to heat up more, with a huge bidding war breaking out for LiveRamp, according to Forrester.\n\nForrester thinks the ultimate winner at the end though will be Google, which will outbid everyone with its trove of cash, making LiveRamp's data available for customers using its newly branded and consolidated adtech stack, Google Marketing Platform.\n\n\"With these acquisitions, the big keep getting bigger,\" Colburn said.", "Amazon announced on Tuesday that it will bring part of its second headquarters, HQ2, to New York City. The headquarters will be located in Long Island City, a neighborhood of Queens, and the city's pitch to Amazon highlighted Long Island City's proximity to LaGuardia Airport, which has a reputation for being one of the worst airports in the US.\n\nAccording to the proposal, it takes 15 minutes to travel from Long Island City to LaGuardia by car and 45 minutes to get there by public transit. But HQ2 employees could find their relatively quick commutes outweighed by the airport's cramped, dirty, and poorly-lit terminals, as well as its narrow pick-up and drop-off areas.\n\nWhile renovations to the airport's terminals, parking system, and drop-off and pick-up areas are underway, the airport is sorely lacking in its current state, according to a 2018 study of more than 40,000 travelers by JD Power, which found that respondents were less satisfied with their experiences at LaGuardia than at any other large or medium airport in North America.\n\nI used LaGuardia when I flew to Chicago in December 2017 and realized why its reputation is so horrible.\n\nHere's why being close to LaGuardia may not be a huge perk for part of Amazon's new headquarters.", "After more than a year of speculation, Amazon has chosen two locations for its second North American headquarters: the National Landing area of Arlington, Virginia, and Long Island City, Queens.\n\nThe two winners are expected to split the number of HQ2 jobs, with each one preparing to accommodate about 25,000 new employees.\n\nWhile this could put a strain on housing and infrastructure in the Washington, DC, metro area, there's an even bigger concern in Queens.\n\nA 2017 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggested that, under the worst climate conditions, parts of New York \u2014 including parts of Long Island City \u2014 could be underwater by 2100. The image below shows the areas at risk of flooding by the next century due to extreme sea-level rise.\n\nGoogle Earth/Climate Central\n\nScientists have singled out Queens as the New York City borough with the most land at risk of flooding. Data from Zillow and the Union of Concerned Scientists predicts that more than 2,700 homes, or nearly 7,200 residents, could experience chronic flooding by 2045. If that happens, Queens could end up with $1.2 billion in property damage in less than 30 years.\n\nThat's concerning for an area still reeling from the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Though Long Island City escaped some of Sandy's more devastating effects in 2012, it experienced significant flooding along the East River, where residents were forced to evacuate.\n\nIn the six years since, Long Island City has witnessed a major boom in real estate, but not all of the buildings have been able to make adjustments to protect against sea-level rise.\n\nExisting industrial homes \"really can't do much to address this problem until you're talking about a teardown,\" said Christina DeCurtis, a broker at Compass who sold property in Queens in the wake of the storm.\n\nRead more: Sea levels are rising faster than they have in 28 centuries \u2014 here's where New York City could flood first\n\nDeCurtis said that even after Sandy, a few high-rises built their electrical grids at ground level, which could cause them to lose power during a storm.\n\nThat might not be a problem for Amazon, which will have plenty of funds to fortify its new headquarters, but it could pose issues for the thousands of new residents who will soon occupy the area \u2014 and the more than 68,000 people who currently live there.\n\nIn recent years, Long Island City has already seen mounting congestion on its subways, overcrowding in its schools, and sewers that are backing up. But these concerns pale in comparison to what might happen if the area becomes submerged in water. Under those circumstances, even Amazon won't be able to adequately prepare.", "Business Insider Intelligence is continually adding new types of coverage to better serve our subscribers.

The retailer's goal was for both its private labels and branded merchandise to win shoppers' favor, but the industry average for new product success rate is below 40%, Petro said, making it difficult for Dick's to build a selection that would make it stand out to shoppers. Creating an attractive product assortment is of growing importance for many retailers as Amazon adds more products and brands, and becomes many consumers' go-to shopping destination. This is particularly relevant for sporting goods retailers because Amazon has launched its own activewear private labels and raked in an estimated $6.5 billion in sports and outdoor sales in the US in 2017, up 15% year-over-year (YoY), according to a report from One Click Retail sent to Business Insider Intelligence.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe retailer incorporated First Insight's analytics on consumers' sentiments to inform its designing, pricing, and buying decisions to make its selection more appealing. First Insight collects consumer data on shoppers' demographic information, their scores on product appeal as well as how much they would pay for products (see below), and additional comments through email, social media, and the retailer's site. The data is then run through the firm's predictive analytics models to give Dick's unique insight into what consumers want, which informs the retailer's product development process for private labels, buying decisions for branded goods, and pricing strategy for all products.\n\nWant to read the rest of this case study, along with all the others we're producing on a weekly basis?", "Bill Gates isn't afraid of potty talk.\n\nEarlier this month, he got onstage in front of business leaders, investors, and government officials from around the world and unveiled what he politely referred to as a \"little exhibit.\" It was a glass jar filled with human feces.\n\n\"It's good to be reminded, in there could be over 200 trillion rotavirus particles, 20 billion Shigella bacteria, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs,\" Gates told the crowd, which had gathered in Beijing, China, for an event called the Reinvented Toilet Expo.\n\nThe jar of poo was used to make a point: Around the world, in places without proper sanitation or sewage systems, there's much more than a jar's worth of unsanitary human waste sitting around.\n\n\"That's what kids, when they're out playing, they are being exposed to all the time,\" Gates said, noting the link between bad sanitation and disease, death, and malnutrition.\n\nTo address that problem, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation started its Reinvent the Toilet Challenge in 2011. The initiative funded $200 million in grants for universities around the world to develop a next-generation toilet. The goal: develop a waste-processing system that doesn't need to be hooked up to a typical sanitation and sewer grid.\n\nNew systems that have been created with those grants turn what we put into the toilet into fertilizer, energy, or recycled water \u2014 some of which is good enough to drink.\n\nThe Gates Foundation now intends to invest an additional $200 million into research that can yield additional ways to deal with human waste at the source.\n\nThe problem with the toilets we have now\n\nMalickane Gueye stands with his children in front of a newly constructed toilet at his home in Dakar, Senegal on September 25, 2018. \u00a9Gates Archive/Sam Phelps\n\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization estimated that just 39% of the world's people were using a \"safely managed\" lavatory, whether it be a toilet or a decently clean latrine.\n\nLiving without a good toilet can be unsafe. People who come in contact with fecal matter face a risk of deadly infections and chronic health problems, since human feces carry pathogens like E. coli, Streptococcus, hepatitis A and E, and more. Those can cause pneumonia and diarrhea \u2014 the top two killers of kids around the world.\n\nPlus, if people don't have a place to go at home, they have to travel alone into woods or a field to relieve themselves, which can be risky for women and children living in conflict zones.\n\n\"When you think about things that are basic, right up there with health and enough to eat, I think having a reasonable toilet certainly belongs on that list,\" Gates said.\n\nRead More: Do you really have to wash your hands every time you use the bathroom? The definitive answer, according to science\n\nHe estimates that illness from poor sanitation costs the world over $223 billion per year in lost wages and extra healthcare.\n\nWith stratospheric rates of population growth in cities across Africa and Asia, the problem is only set to get worse.\n\n\"Unless we do something, the cycle of disease will actually be accelerated,\" Gates said.\n\nGates doesn't think it's practical to expect the entire world to connect their homes to yet-to-be-built sewer systems and wastewater-treatment plants. That's why he has been on a quest to do for toilets what he argues Microsoft did for computing: get the business off a centralized, \"mainframe\" system.\n\nGates started by asking engineers at universities around the world a simple but unanswered question: \"Could you leapfrog the long-accepted 'gold standard' of sanitation?\"\n\n\"A decade ago, I didn't think I would be able to tell you so much about poop,\" Gates said.\n\nThe first generation of sewer-free toilets is here, but they aren't cheap yet\n\nAfter seven years and $200 million of investment, the first batch of products from the \"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\" is being tested in locations around India, Africa, and China.\n\nOne of the first new toilets is the solar-powered Eco-san system, pictured below. Based on technology developed at Cal Tech, the Eco-san extracts clean water from human waste and reuses it for future flushing.\n\nAn Eco-san Toilet at Yixing Huankeyuan Elementary School in Yixing City, Jiangsu Province, China. \u00a9Gates Archive/Shawn Koh\n\nOther models are also in the works from companies and universities around the world.\n\nThe University of South Florida's NEWgenerator treatment system also runs on solar energy and can be hooked up to any existing toilet. It uses a nano-membrane filter (kind of like a coffee filter) with feces-digesting anaerobic bacteria inside to filter clean water out of the waste.\n\nAnother toilet from Cranfield University in the UK comes equipped with a little trap-door odor barrier and scraper so that it requires no water for flushing. Clean water is filtered out of waste via a large, orange screw in the tank, and solid waste is burned inside the toilet's combustor, which converts the waste into ash and energy. (Thankfully, this all happens out of sight of the people who are using the toilet.)\n\n\"Heat from the burning is used to help dry the next batch of solids,\" Gates explained in a video. He added, \"it's a very clever toilet.\"\n\nYet another model, from Swiss engineering firm Helbling, is called the HTClean Toilet, and it functions like a pressure cooker for poo. The immense pressure and heat help the waste separate into water and solids that aren't toxic.\n\nDuke University has also started testing its Gates-funded toilet this year at a textile mill in Coimbatore, India. The system, shown below, separates solid and liquid waste and makes it possible to safely reuse the water for flushing.\n\nPrateek K, a technical field consultant engineer, stands next to the Duke system, which dries out fecal matter and separates parasitic worms from feces, allowing for water to be recycled or discharged. \u00a9Gates Archive/Ryan Lobo\n\nNone of these sewer-free toilets are currently at a price that's feasible for individual homes. For now, the new toilets are going to be used at schools, apartment complexes, and community bathroom areas, Gates said.\n\nBut his eventual goal is for off-grid toilets to be used in homes around the world. He told the crowd in Beijing that he's ready to spend an additional $200 million developing the technology for those next-generation toilets. But Gates hopes someday the private sector will start developing sewer-free home toilets and compete to provide those toilets to the 4.5 billion people around the world who don't have them now.\n\n\"We estimate that by 2030, the opportunity here is over $6 billion a year,\" he said.\n\nChildren at the Gugulethu Primary School in KwaMashu, outside of Durban, South Africa. The school is a recipient of a new Eco-san toilet system. \u00a9Gates Archive/Samantha Reinders\n\nGates is also investing in self-powered sewage systems\n\nGates is also obsessed with something called an Omni Processor, which is essentially a much smaller version of a waste-treatment plant.\n\nThe small plants, one of which is already on the ground in Dakar, Senegal, can serve between 5,000 and 100,000 customers and are completely self-powered. They take in toilet waste, kill pathogens in the sewage, and convert it into \"products with commercial value - like clean water, electricity, and fertilizer,\" Gates said. It's a lot like what astronauts do on the International Space Station\u2014 turning their pee into clean, drinkable H2O.\n\nTechnician Idrissa Coulibaly walks to the Janicki Omni Processor in Dakar, Senegal on September 25, 2018. \u00a9Gates Archive/Sam Phelps\n\nGates is so enthused about the Omni Processor's clean, recycled water that he once drank it himself.\n\n\"It tasted great,\" he told the Beijing crowd. \"I'd be glad to do it again any time.\"\n\nWaste collector Assane Ciss\u00e9 (left) and Mariama Seck vacuum human waste from a reservoir inside a courtyard.

Soltero didn't immediately announce his next move, but he told Business Insider he plans on \"getting back to building new things.\"\n\nSoltero was something of a rising star. He started at Microsoft in early 2014, following the acquisition of Acompli, a startup he had cofounded. In a matter of weeks, Acompli's email app had been rebranded to Outlook for iPhone and Android \u2014 a move that was seen as emblematic of then new CEO Satya Nadella's embrace of rival operating systems.\n\nOutlook was, and is, a popular smartphone email client, particularly among corporate users. As the app gained traction, so did Soltero's influence. He soon found himself leading Outlook across all platforms, and then, leading strategy for all of Microsoft Office.\n\nSoltero has a reputation at Microsoft for speaking truth to corporate power. In 2015, he delivered a sobering presentation, warning employees that without swift action to modernize Microsoft Office and Outlook, the company could find itself as irrelevant as the competitors it had long since vanquished. He told the Wall Street Journal that this presentation actually earned him hate mail from employees, who accused him of being \"disrespectful\" to the company's legacy.\n\nRead more: A rising star at Microsoft says employees sent him hate mail for suggesting the company might be falling behind\n\nIn March of this year, Soltero took command of Cortana, Microsoft's rival to Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and the Google Assistant. He was given a mandate to find a niche for Cortana, which comes built into Windows 10, but has struggled to gain traction on smartphones and elsewhere.\n\nSoltero's departure comes as Microsoft continues an ongoing streamlining of the Cortana business.\n\nThe general idea, as ZDNet's Foley notes, is that Microsoft is trying to reposition Cortana as a general helper within Office \u2014 sort of a smarter, more capable successor to its infamous Clippy.

It could decide access to healthcare for millions of low-income Americans.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, which allows low income Americans making up to 138% of the federal poverty limit to get access to the program, will be on the ballot in three states. And six other states that have not expanded the program have pro-expansion governor candidates on the ballot, as well.\n\nAccording to Avalere Health, a healthcare consulting firm, up to 2.7 million Americans could gain access to healthcare if the results break a certain way.

A February poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy think tank, found that 56% of people in non-expansion states wanted to expand Medicaid, while just 37% were against it.\n\nAnother poll in October from Kaiser found that 49% of people said they were more likely to vote for a candidate if they supported expansion, while just 28% said it made them less likely to vote for a candidate.\n\nAndrew Gillum in Florida, Stacey Abrams in Georgia, and Billie Sutton in South Dakota have all used their support for Medicaid expansion as key planks in their campaigns.\n\nRead more: The 2018 midterms will have a big impact on healthcare, from Medicaid to nurses to abortion\u00bb\n\nThis isn't to say that the program would be expanded immediately if results go a certain way: State legislatures could stymie the expansion, as Virginia's legislature did for years despite the state's Democratic governor's wishes.

It was the first updated threat assessment since 2005, and officials will use the data to prioritize volcanoes for research and monitoring.\n\nThis year's report includes new entries on potentially active volcanoes and updated scores for previously listed volcanoes. The 161 volcanoes are separated into five categories: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. Threat scores were determined based on 24 factors, including how often a volcano erupts, how powerful eruptions are, how many people live nearby, and how many people have been killed or evacuated due to a past volcanic eruption.\n\nThe rankings are not meant to serve as predictions for which volcano is most likely to erupt next. However, the volcanoes with the highest threat level would likely be the most destructive if they did erupt.\n\nAccording to the report, the US is one of the most volcanically active nations in the world, with more than 10% of all active and potentially active volcanoes in the country.

In a letter from June, workers demanded Amazon stop selling Rekognition to the police, and to take measures toward further accountability and transparency. Employees also urged the company to cut ties with Palantir, a data company that's known to provide software to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for its deportation and tracking program.\n\nAmazon isn't the only company to see its employees protest its dealings with the US government.

The Ecobee4 has Alexa built inside, which means it's actually a fully blown Echo itself. You can ask the Ecobee4 to adjust the temperature directly, without having to have an Echo in your house; it has a microphone to listen to your questions, and a little speaker to respond so you'll be able to hear whether the it heard you. This feature earned the Ecobee4 a spot in our best smart thermostat's guide.\n\nBecause it has Alexa inside, you can also ask it to control other Alexa-enabled devices, or learn third-party skills, so really, you're getting a smart home hub and smart thermostat for the price of one.\n\nThe Ecobee4 also works with the Google Assistant and Apple's HomeKit, but you'll need to get a Google Home or use Siri on an Apple device for either to work; they're not built into the thermostat like Alexa is.\n\nFacebook\n\nRead more: 12 smart home gadgets that practically clean the house for you\n\nOne of the shortcomings of installing a smart thermostat is that its sensors can only take the temperature in the room they're in. That's fine if you live in a small place, but is impractical if you live in a multi-floor home. It's annoying for the first floor to be heated or cooled perfectly, while the second floor is too hot or cold.\n\nTo fix this, the Ecobee4 comes with a room sensor that you can put in a room that's far away from the thermostat. The sensor will wirelessly send temperature readings to the Ecobee4 to make adjustments so that everybody is comfortable. If your home has more floors, or a room that runs weirdly hot or cold, you can get an additional sensor to keep in that room.\n\nOnce it's set up, the Ecobee4 will automatically make adjustments based on whether or not you're home, which Ecobee says can reduce your heating bill by up 23% versus keeping it locked at 72 degrees. That can make a big difference over time.\n\nIf you're trying to make your house smarter and more energy efficient, the Ecobee4 is a win-win. I guarantee it'll be easier to understand than a standard digital thermostat, and you may even start saving money this winter instead of worrying about your energy costs.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of this deal, it's only going to be around today.", "In a 14th floor dining room at UBS's New York headquarters last Friday, five teams of 20-something bankers readied their pitch.\n\nThey weren't presenting an idea for a takeover, or even trying to win the right to manage some institution's wealth, but rather competing for a chance to bring some fresh technology ideas to UBS's investment-banking division.\n\nThe five teams had been selected from a field of 11 that submitted ideas for the division's first-ever innovation competition. In all, more than 30 of the division's junior bankers participated, according to Sam Kendall, who runs Americas investment banking at UBS and served as one of the judges.\n\nEvents like these are taking place across Wall Street as firms look for ways to engage younger workers and source good ideas for bringing technology deeper into investment banking. All of the groups targeted \"pain points,\" such as the mundane and often rote tasks on which junior bankers spend much of their days. These include building financial models, creating pitch books or filling out standard documents.\n\nRead more:Here's why Wall Street hasn't had an innovation since the ATM\n\n\"The knowledge is at the edge of these organizations and you have to create forums like this to hear it,\" said Kendall, who has also introduced pizza lunches and created a lending library on a shelf outside his office to help foster communication and outside-the-box thinking since taking over in March.\n\nThe assembled judges included Kendall; Damian Krauze, his COO; Bethany Ropa, a real-estate investment banker; Lauren Surzyn, a banker in UBS's data solutions distribution and data sourcing business; and Vik Hebatpuria, global head of fintech investment banking.\n\nOther senior leaders also attended included Robert Karofsky, newly named co-head of the unit that includes investment banking and sales and trading, and investment-banking chair Ros Stephenson.\n\nThe master of ceremonies for Friday's event was Barry Hurewitz, the COO of the research division and one of the creators behind the firm's Evidence Lab product. In his introduction, Hurewitz offered his own advice for coming up with the next big thing: start small, organize the exercise so its failure isn't catastrophic, gather data, establish data-driven feedback loops to make the product better, and then grow from there.\n\nThe teams gave it a try. They got seven minutes to present, and five minutes to answer questions from the judges. Each had a slick PowerPoint presentation to aid their remarks, and they all tried to answer common questions: What was the addressable problem? How did their solution solve it? What were the costs of the project, both direct and indirect? How long was the implementation timeline?\n\nTimelines and cost projections among the groups were a little erratic, with some getting closer to the likely mark than others, though the judges pledged to look through such shortcomings. In the end, UBS is likely to implement elements of each solution, Kendall said.\n\nBut by the end, there could only be one winner: the group of bankers Alexander Li, Dmitry Aksakov and Assiya Dair that proposed using artificial intelligence to help automate some of the more mundane tasks of investing banking.\n\nThe proud winners, from left, Alexander Li, Dmitry Aksakov, Assiya Dair. UBS\n\nTheir solution, a family of applications with the promise and power to develop term sheets, would create PowerPoint presentations or financial models, and eventually, write entire documents. The team had help from Ronald Jansen, head of UBS's Data and Analytics Lab, who joined earlier this year after 13 years running a team of quants at Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe winning team gets more time and money to work on the project, and an additional year-end bonus.\n\nThe runner up was a front-end dashboard for UBS's customer relationship management software. A group that proposed a mobile app for communicating investor orders to clients selling equity or debt into the market fell to No. 3 in large part because another group in UBS was already working on a similar project. Other ideas included a predictive calendar for planning corporate meetings at upcoming conferences and a plan for tablets to replace physical pitch books.\n\nTo be sure, other Wall Street firms are already building some of the projects that these junior bankers are proposing. Goldman has begun automating the IPO process, other banks have book-build apps and machine learning is a hot trend across the industry.\n\nBut more than anything, the competition was a place where junior bankers could have their voices heard, get access to senior management, and enjoy a chance to think creatively, if even for just a couple hours of the day.\n\n\"If we can release time from bankers to just think, sit there with a blank sheet of paper to think about their clients' problems,\" Kendall said, \"then maybe we'll move the ball forward a little bit.\"\n\nSee also:", "Chinese video game publisher Tencent plans to implement age restrictions for all of its games in China in 2019 and will continue to use the country's national citizen database to verify player identities.\n\nThe new policy aims to limit playing time for children, as Chinese officials continue to express concerns about video game addiction. Tencent is the world's largest video game publisher and China is the world's largest video game market, generating more than $34 billion in annual revenue, according to NewZoo.\n\nThe rising popularity of video games has created a cultural clash in the country, with critics arguing that gaming is an unproductive and potentially addictive hobby for Chinese youth. Since last year, regulators have slowly restricted the approval of new games and prevented publishers from monetizing titles that are already popular.\n\nRead more:China is cracking down on new video games entering the country and it's costing publishing giants billions in profit\n\nIn a response to criticism and government recommendations, Tencent began age-restricting playtime for its most popular game, \"Honour of Kings,\" last year. Players under the age of 18 were limited to playing just two hours a day, while those under the age of 12 were limited to one hour a day. On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, the company announced it will soon expand the policy to its top 10 most popular mobile games, and more PC and mobile titles will get the same treatment next year.\n\nTencent recently announced that all players will need to verify their identity using their Real Name Identity System (RNIS) to play \"Honour of Kings.\" According to research firm Niko Partners, each player's name and age is checked against the national citizen database maintained by China's Ministry of Public Security. In September, Tencent also began testing facial recognition software with thousands of randomly selected users living in Beijing and Shenzhen.\n\nWhile the verification system and age-limits are meant to address the potential negative impact of video games on children, it raises new questions about player privacy. \"Honour of Kings\" alone has more than 200 million players, and Tencent is documenting identifying information for every one of them to verify with the Chinese government.\n\nAs it stands, gamers playing Tencent games outside of China aren't subject to the same strict verification process.", "Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou didn't become one of the most powerful people in technology by being bad at negotiating.\n\nAnd increasingly, it seems as if he and his company, which manufactures electronics like Apple's iPhone and Microsoft's Xbox, negotiated a stunning package to build a 21.5-million-square-foot factory complex in Wisconsin.\n\nFor building that massive factory, which Foxconn said at the time could create 13,000 blue-collar jobs, the Taiwanese electronics giant received:\n\nMore than $4.5 billion in taxpayer subsidies, most of it in \"direct cash payments from taxpayers,\" working out to $220,000 to $1 million per job created.\n\nAn exemption from limits on smog pollution and other environmental rules, allowing it to reroute streams during construction and operation, and from filing an environmental-impact statement.\n\nSpecial court privileges, including the ability to appeal directly to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nExpanded eminent-domain privileges, which may help the government seize the property of holdouts who do not want to sell their properties to Foxconn.\n\nIn total, the factory was estimated to cost $1,800 per Wisconsin household, according to The New Yorker.\n\nBut Foxconn promised 13,000 jobs before starting to roll back the scope of the facility, according to The Verge. All of a sudden, that promise seemed like a reach, a goal that might never be met.\n\nIn May, it was revealed that Foxconn had scaled back its plans. Instead of producing giant, 10-foot-by-11-foot panels for TVs, it would create smaller glass panels for smartphones and displays. Eventually, Foxconn officials said, it could make the \"Generation 10.5\" plant originally promised, but it might take a while.\n\nSix weeks later, it backtracked. Foxconn could never build the plant it originally promised because of competition from China. Instead, the Wisconsin factory would focus on what the company called \"AI 8K + 5G,\" a change that would mean employing 10% assembly workers and 90% \"knowledge workers,\" and relying heavily on automation.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Foxconn was likely to bring in employees from China to help staff the plant because it couldn't find enough skilled engineers in Wisconsin. In a statement, Foxconn told The Journal it still planned to hire 13,000 workers.\n\n'Mr. President, the eagle flies'\n\nGou and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin survey the site before breaking ground on the plant on June 28. Getty\n\nThe Wisconsin factory was the culmination of a secret bidding war among states to offer as many incentives as possible. Wisconsin officials told subordinates to monitor the packages that others like Michigan were offering, according to records reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nThough the factory ended up being a win for Wisconsin, President Donald Trump touted it as a victory for his administration when the location was revealed in July 2017 at a White House press conference. (The deal was officially signed in November 2017.)\n\n\"Thanks especially to my friend, one of the great businessmen anywhere in the world, Terry Gou,\" Trump said at the time. \"I would see Terry, and I'd say, 'Terry, you have to give us a couple of those massive \u2014 these are massive places that you do such great work with.' And he's going to be doing that in a state that's very close to my heart, Wisconsin.\"\n\nHe added: \"To make such an incredible investment, Chairman Gou put his faith and confidence in the future of the American economy. In other words, if I didn't get elected, he definitely would not be spending $10 billion.\"\n\nGou said that each of the three times he had met Trump, the president \"emphasized the importance of manufacturing in America.\"\n\n\"Mr. President, the eagle flies,\" Gou said, referring to the project's codename, \"Project Flying Eagle.\"\n\nUltimately, it's not Trump or even House Speaker Paul Ryan feeling the repercussions of a deal that doesn't look great for Wisconsin, but Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who is facing a difficult reelection fight on Tuesday. Polls have found him to be neck-and-neck with his Democratic opponent, Tony Evers.\n\nThe argument Walker is facing is that he knew exactly what and how much he was giving up to score a talking point about bringing jobs to Wisconsin \u2014 and still overpaid. After Wisconsin, the next closest state in offering incentives was Michigan, at $2.3 billion, according to The Verge.\n\nThe public couldn't have known about the details of the deal beforehand either, making it important that elected officials would try to drive a hard bargain.\n\nFor example, in July 2017, Business Insider requested the presentations and documentation that Foxconn had provided the Wisconsin Department of Revenue. A Wisconsin secretary told Business Insider in an email:\n\n\"I am withholding emails that contain information relating to [the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation's] consideration of pending grants, loans or economic development projects with Foxconn, pursuant to section 238.08, which provides that records relating to pending WEDC grants, loans or economic development projects that must remain confidential to protect the competitive nature of the grant, loan or project.\n\n\"Also, in balance, public disclosure of records relating to pending or potential opportunities is less beneficial than nondisclosure, because disclosure impedes the WEDC's ability to productively negotiate with companies about potential projects that will create jobs, increase investment in the state, and generate additional state revenue for state and local governments. Such disclosures would hamper WEDC's efforts to attract new businesses to the state or negotiate with existing companies seeking to expand their operations in Wisconsin, and could impede economic development in this state, to the detriment of the State and its citizens.\"\n\nWisconsin may have successfully attracted Foxconn, but it's increasingly looking as if the entire factory project may be to the detriment of its citizens.\n\nKnow more about the Foxconn factory in Wisconsin?

Steven John/Business Insider\n\nI've never slept all that well. It takes me forever to nod off, and if I wake up in the middle of the night, I often see the clock roll past 2, 3, and sometimes even 4 a.m. before I fall asleep again. That leaves me with a bit less than two hours more to sleep before my son comes in and taps me on the head to start Daddy and Ben time. And with an infant daughter waking my wife and me up every few hours these days, sleep has become even more of a challenge as it's an ever more precious commodity.\n\nBeing chronically sleep deprived, I have also been on a slow, but steady hunt for a better pillow.\n\nA few months ago, we upgraded to a Casper Wave mattress, and literally overnight I started sleeping rather more soundly. It was suddenly clear to me how much quality bedding can improve the quality of sleep, so my search for a better pillow gained intensity. I had tried three or four pillows since our cross-country move from Los Angeles to New York in mid-2016, a move that saw us toss most of our older pillows. Then, over the summer of 2018, I tried three more pillows in just three months. One I relegated to guest closet status after just two nights because of neck cramps. Another I stuck with for a few weeks, but ultimately enjoyed no real sleep quality improvement.\n\nThen I tried the Easy Breather Side Sleeper Pillow from Nest Bedding, and the search was over.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about the pillow is its unique shape.\n\nThe cutout shape of this pillow is perfect for my unique body orientation as I fall asleep. Nest Bedding\n\nIt's a rectangle with an obtuse isosceles triangle cut out of the bottom \u2014 it looks like the lower half of a bow tie, in other words. Into that recessed space, one can tuck a shoulder while sleeping on either side of his or her body, enjoying comfortable neck support and proper spinal alignment. And the face part of your head will appreciate the soft feel of the Tencel fabric exterior (Tencel is a wood-based cellulose fiber similar to rayon, FYI) as well as the soft, but supportive memory foam filling.\n\nThe fabric and fill are, as the pillow's name suggests, highly breathable, which help with thermoregulation during sleep. That's a fancy way of saying that you won't get too hot using this pillow, which is great news for me, because I'm basically a furnace.\n\nHere's the thing: I rarely sleep on my side.

But \"there's nothing necessarily nefarious about it.\"\n\nRead more: A competitor is emerging to challenge the marijuana retail chain dominating the industry, and it just closed a $640 million acquisition\n\nIn a traditional IPO, companies have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (or in Canada the Canadian Securities Administrators) and are rigorously vetted by major investment banks, whose analysts and bankers ask a ton of detailed questions about the company's finances.\n\nThe IPO process also involves a months-long \"road show\" where the company and the investment bankers handling the transaction pitch the company to potential investors.\n\nCompanies choosing the RTO route are able to skip much of that process \u2014 though smaller banks do underwrite these types of deals \u2014 and step into a public listing immediately after the acquisition closes.\n\nThis can be useful if the company is planning to use its stock to go on a buying spree, said Samuel Dibble, a San Francisco-based partner at law firm Baker Botts.\n\n\"The one circumstance where I would say, okay, this makes sense is look: we have a really viable company. We're confident we could raise money, but we don't want to wait because we think there's a real opportunity right now to consolidate within the industry,\" Dibble said.\n\nA MedMen store in Los Angeles, California. Lucy Nicholson/Reuters\n\nIt's deal mania for US-based cannabis retailers\n\nCompanies that go public via RTO are triggering a deal boom.\n\nThere have been 260 cannabis M&A deals so far in 2018, up from 131 at the same point in 2017, according to data from Viridian Capital Advisors, a cannabis-focused financial advisory firm.\n\nMedMen, which operates a number of upscale cannabis dispensaries in California, Nevada, and New York, among other states, went public at the end of May after buying the British Columbia-based Ladera Ventures (formerly T.M.T. Resources), a shell company which previously operated oil-and-gas extraction sites in Alberta.\n\nAcquisitions followed: in October, MedMen acquired the medical-marijuana dispensary chain PharmaCann in a $682 million all-stock transaction, nearly doubling the combined firm's footprint overnight.\n\niAnthus, one of MedMen's retail competitors, went public via RTO in 2016 after acquiring Genarca Holdings. In October, iAnthus scooped up the Toronto-based MPX Bioceutical in a $640 million all-stock transaction, among many other smaller transactions.\n\n'Two buckets' of cannabis companies\n\nRTOs don't make sense for every cannabis company.\n\nThere are companies like marijuana cultivator Tilray, which, though majority-controlled by a US firm, predominately operate in Canada and don't violate federal law \u2014 and are therefore able to list on US-based exchanges like the NYSE.\n\nAnd then there are others like MedMen that have opted to go public via a reverse merger on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE). The CSE is a secondary exchange based in Toronto \u2014 the more mainstream Toronto Stock Exchange won't list companies that distribute or sell cannabis directly.\n\nCanada has federal laws legalizing marijuana on the books, meaning Canadian institutions are able to invest in the industry, and that companies dealing with the plant directly are able to access banking services, list on public exchanges, and deduct the regular costs of doing business from their taxes.\n\nIn the US, it's a different story: while recreational marijuana is legal in 9 states and medically legal in 31, it's still considered a Schedule I drug by the US federal government.\n\nRead more: The CEO of the biggest cannabis company in the US reveals what's next following a $682 million acquisition\n\nUS-based exchanges won't list cannabis companies with any US operations, no matter what the states say. And most institutions won't invest, fearing a crackdown from federal regulators.\n\nThat leaves them few options to raise money, other than tapping into Canadian public markets.\n\n\"The CSE has become the exchange of choice for US operators,\" said Joe Lusardi, the CEO of Curaleaf, a Massachusetts-based cannabis retail company that owns dispensary licenses in a number of states. \"It's where investment capital is meeting the opportunity of the moment.\"\n\nCuraleaf went public via an RTO in October.\n\nDevin Melnyk, a long-time marijuana grower and a consultant with Pure Sunfarms, holds trimmed marijuana as it comes out of a high-volume cannabis trimming machine at a massive tomato greenhouse being renovated to grow pot in Delta, British Columbia. AP Photo/Ted S. Warren\n\nCriticisms abound about reverse takeovers\n\nThere are a number of drawbacks to reverse takeovers for both investors and the companies themselves.\n\nFor investors, the process of an RTO is \"a lot less transparent\" than a traditional IPO, said Anna Pinedo, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown.\n\n\"Oftentimes it leads to some degree of concern by the institutional investor community,\" Pinedo said. Companies that go public through an RTO may not have been vetted in the same rigorous way as IPOs, leading to a dearth of solid information about the company's financials, she said.\n\nFor the company itself, it may not know exactly who owns their shares since they are acquiring a shell \u2014 and the shareholders may be in it for a short-term profit, Dibble said.\n\n\"It doesn't guarantee that there's any consistent trading market or that they're truly investors out there who are interested in owning your stock,\" Dibble said. \"There's a lot of nefarious trading activity that goes on in any thinly-traded stock.\"\n\nThat can lead to short-term volatility, as in Curaleaf's example, which dropped precipitously on the day it started trading (though it has since mostly recovered).\n\nDibble said he always advises cannabis companies that there are easier ways to raise money than through an RTO.\n\nIf you can get the money from a private investor, it's cheaper and faster than an RTO \u2014 and you can control who owns shares in your company, Dibble said.\n\n\"You won't lose your strategic advantage,\" he added.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the correct number of cannabis M&A deals in 2018.\n\nSee also:", "Certain phrases will ensure your colleagues trust you.

The metal-rich object was found to be about 750 feet by 115 feet and reddish in color. It was moving inexplicably fast but not circling the sun.\n\nInstead, it had dived between Mercury and the sun and was zooming past Earth on its way out of our solar system, a path that meant Oumuamua was an interstellar traveler from beyond the solar system.\n\nScientists first called the object an asteroid, then later deemed it a mildly active comet. But Oumuamua didn't show typical signs of a comet, like a tail of dust and gas.\n\nJust in case, astronomers pointed powerful radio telescopes at the object to scan for radio transmissions. But they found nothing.\n\nBut since Oumuamua's discovery, scientists have continued to wonder whether it could have originated from some intelligent life-form.\n\nA new paper from the Harvard scientists Shmuel Bialy and Abraham Loeb suggests that quirks in Oumuamua's rotation and speed could be the result of solar-powered movement. That means the object would be made of some thin material that could absorb radiation from the sun \u2014 either a naturally created material we've never seen before, or something made by aliens.\n\nOumuamua \"might be a lightsail of artificial origin,\" the paper says, referring to an object designed to use solar radiation for propulsion. Humans have experimented before with lightsails, but the idea remains in its infancy.\n\n\"One possibility is that Oumuamua is a lightsail, floating in interstellar space as a debris from an advanced technological equipment,\" the paper says.\n\nThe idea that the object could have been part of some massive alien solar-powered technology may seem far-fetched, but the authors suggest an even more \"exotic\" explanation: \"that Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.\"\n\nThe authors argue that if Oumuamua were just a random interstellar rock, we should have seen more objects like it. That and the object's strange movements suggest it could have a source of power beyond gravitational pulls, they said.\n\nOumuamua has already passed Earth on its way out of the solar system, so the object is too far away for scientists to continue studying it, meaning its origin, behavior, and makeup will remain a mystery. So the Harvard authors' \"exotic\" guesses are just as good as anyone's at this point.\n\nLoeb told NBC News that the idea that Oumuamua could be alien-made was \"purely scientific and evidence-based.\"\n\n\"I follow the maxim of Sherlock Holmes: When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,\" Loeb said.", "Just weeks after literally embracing President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, rapper Kanye West donated $126,460 to Chicago Democratic mayoral candidate Amara Enyia, The Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nWest, a native of Chicago, had already donated $73,540 to Enyia in October.\n\nEnyia thanked West for his support at a recent rally, stating, \"I also have to give a shoutout and kudos to Ye, who is from the South Side and is invested and committed to giving back to our city.\"\n\nChicago's mayoral election is on February 26, 2019.\n\nThe rapper has had a tumultuous relationship with politics over the years.

Kitchen designs, recipes, and tastes may change, but one thing remains the same: our faith in this reliable and versatile piece of cookware.\n\nThe proud owners of several vintage cast iron pans passed down from their grandmother, Stephen and Chris Muscarella couldn't help but compare their look and performance to that of modern models. Their company, Field Company, reads simultaneously like a nostalgic love letter to the time-honored virtues of cast iron and an ambitious challenge against its inconveniences.\n\nThey raised $1.6 million on Kickstarter for their Field Skillet, a \"Lighter, Smoother Cast Iron,\" which, with \"light\" and \"cast iron\" in the same name, sounds like a bundle of contradictions right off the bat. But from instant cameras to record players, vintage with a modern twist is on the rise, and the Field Skillet is just the piece of cookware to fulfill that connection to the past.\n\nField Company/Instagram\n\nMy first impression as I took the pan out of the box was that it was indeed light. While it's not usually easy to casually lift a cast iron pan with one hand, doing so with the Field Skillet (the No. 8 weighs 4.5 pounds, and the No. 10 weighs six pounds) is a more comfortable endeavor and doesn't run the risk of half your dinner landing on the floor.\n\nThe other immediate difference, which is part of the reason why it's light, is that the cooking surface is machined and polished, not rough and pebbled from the residual sand of the molding process. The smooth surface is much nicer to cook on, plus it comes pre-seasoned with two coats of grapeseed oil, so it's ready to cook with right away and you have a head start in building up layers of seasoning.\n\nThe pan wasn't as non-stick as I would've hoped from its first use, but with subsequent use and seasoning, it did quickly reach that satisfying point where you could fly through the process of cooking anything from cornbread to a whole bird with no worries.\n\nTrue to cast iron form, it had great heat retention and distribution, giving a crispy sear to meats and fish skins. Even the most simple assortment of vegetables tasted much better thanks to the combination of strong, consistent heat and the history of past dishes cooked in the pan.\n\nRead more:This kitchen startup only sells one product \u2014 a $95 Dutch oven that can hold its own against those pricier name brands\n\nField Company\n\nThe homage to vintage \u2014 including the flat bottom and heat ring \u2014 is clear in the design of the pan, but you're reminded it's a cast iron of this century. Field Company is eco-friendly by using 75% to 90% recycled iron, and it emphasizes that the pans are made in the US.\n\nLike many online start-ups, it tries to give you an experience, not just a product. It offers seasoning and care instructions in the box and online, as well as online support in case you have trouble with your pan. On- and offline, you'll hear numerous \"correct\" ways to season and take care of cast iron pans, so if you're new to the material and a little intimidated, Field Company can make you feel more confident about joining the cult of cast iron.\n\nThe pans currently come in two sizes. The No. 8 ($125), which should suit your everyday cooking tasks, has an 8.75-inch cooking surface and 10.25-inch top diameter, while the No. 10 ($160), great for large meals, has a 9.75-inch cooking surface and 11.625-inch top diameter. Without a doubt, they're more expensive than popular cast iron models, but this could be an apples-to-oranges comparison since popular models are thick, heavy and have a rough surface, while the Field Skillet is thin, lightweight and polished. It's not easy to find vintage cast iron online anymore, and Field Company's approachable and well-made pan is surely the one to fill the gap.", "Black Friday is one of the biggest and busiest shopping extravaganzas in the US.\n\nIn American culture, turkey dinner and bargain hunting go hand-in-hand during the third week of November.\n\nBlack Friday has become so popular that retailers in other countries that don't traditionally celebrate American Thanksgiving, like in Spain and Canada, have embraced the shopping extravaganza.\n\nThe annual event isn't observed everywhere, though \u2014 some corners of the globe have their own version of holiday shopping madness.\n\nHere's what some of the biggest shopping days of the year look like around the world.", "A Russian fighter buzzed a US Navy reconnaissance plane Monday, coming dangerously close to the American aircraft during a decidedly \"unsafe\" incident.\n\n\"This interaction was determined to be unsafe due to the Su-27 conducting a high speed pass directly in front of the mission aircraft, which put our pilots and crew at risk,\" the Navy said in a statement, adding, \"The intercepting Su-27 made an additional pass, closing with the EP-3 [Aries] and applying its afterburner while conducting a banking turn away.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense said there was \"no radio contact,\" explaining that they came \"came out of nowhere.\" The department explained that these actions \"put our aircrews in danger,\" stressing that \"there is no reason for this behavior.\"\n\nMonday's intercept is one of many close encounters the US military has had with the Russians over the years, and the US has similar problems with the Chinese as well.\n\nHere are seven times the Russian and Chinese militaries came so close to US ships and aircraft they risked disaster.", "After Beverly Hills, California, approved a six-month ban on \"shared mobility devices\" in July, it quickly began impounding electric scooters throughout the city.\n\nOn Thursday, the electric-scooter startup Bird filed a lawsuit against the city, saying it had been fined \"more than $100,000\" from more than 950 citations as a result of the new ordinance. The company says in the suit that \"Beverly Hills has gone to the extreme\" and accuses it of violating the California Vehicle Code by banning its scooters within city limits.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Bird described the Beverly Hills City Council's passage of a six-month ban as a \"hasty and deceptive proceeding riddled with violations of California's open-meeting, public-participation, and environmental laws.\" The company said the city had fought tooth and nail against a subway extension, \"preferring instead to keep transit riders in communities to the east from reaching Beverly Hills.\"\n\nOne example of an impound notice included in Bird's lawsuit.

But that still isn't enough to help it transform into a digital media and marketing powerhouse and take on the Facebook-Google duopoly, according to Forrester.\n\nThat's because AT&T is still not plugged into consumers' daily lives the way Facebook and Google are. One way around that could be to invest in a content platform, according to Forrester \u2014 such a move would enable AT&T to grab not only a more central role in consumers' lives but a bigger share of their 42-hour-a-week video-entertainment-viewing habit.\n\nAs AT&T looks to compete for more market share in advertising, Roku could be an attractive target.\n\nThe argument, according to Forrester, is simple: Roku has a massive (and rapidly growing) user base of 20 million, which, when added to DirecTV's 20 million households, would give AT&T greater scale than any other TV-centric media company.\n\nPlus, Roku captures a lot of detailed data about over-the-top TV viewing and can dynamically insert targeted ads into its videos, which would complement AT&T's new targeted-advertising division, Xandr.\n\nAT&T is ready and willing to wage war against the existing duopoly over advertising dollars, Colburn said.\n\n\"Buying Roku is a natural next step for AT&T after their acquisitions of Time Warner and AppNexus in 2018,\" he said. \"The combination of the biggest audience with massive data and a tech stack that enables precision targeting anchored in quality video content is a highly appealing proposition to advertisers.\"\n\nGoogle could snap up LiveRamp\n\nEver since the data-marketing giant Acxiom sold its marketing-solutions platform to the ad holding company IPG this summer, all eyes have turned to LiveRamp, Acxiom's other big business.\n\nLiveRamp helps brands link their data with real people, and industry experts consider its data-onboarding practice second to none.\n\nAs the industry is increasingly plagued by regulatory concerns, LiveRamp is becoming a highly critical asset for any ad-tech or marketing-tech vendor.\n\nThat's expected to lead to a huge bidding war for LiveRamp, according to Forrester. The likes of Adobe and Salesforce could attempt to counter holding companies like Dentsu Aegis Network, which could seek to complement its Merkle M1 data platform with LiveRamp's data.\n\nBut Forrester thinks the ultimate winner will be Google, which could outbid everyone with its trove of cash and make LiveRamp's data available for customers using its newly branded and consolidated ad-tech stack, Google Marketing Platform.\n\nLiveRamp offers Google enhanced connectivity to the digital world outside of itself, an expanded (and perhaps mutually beneficial) relationship with publishers, and a unique set of data and identity assets, Colburn said \u2014 which would make Google mightier than ever.\n\n\"If Google acquires LiveRamp, it will make its new Marketing Platform all the more powerful and enticing for marketers that have already been using some of Google's legacy tools,\" he said. \"With these acquisitions, the big keep getting bigger.\"", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Roanoke, Virginia; and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania areas vote in the afternoon, since the morning is expected to be wet.\n\nWashington, DC and Philadelphia are likely to be stormy in the morning and the middle of the day, so voters there should aim to go to the polls in the afternoon and evening if they want to stay dry.\n\nMeanwhile, Norfolk, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Dover, Delaware; Atlantic City, New Jersey and New York City are expected to have the best voting conditions in the morning, before rain hits in the evening.\n\nJim Geraghty, senior political correspondent for the conservative National Review, tweeted Tuesday morning that the rain was \"coming down in buckets\" in northern Virginia, where close House elections are taking place in the state's 7th and 10th districts.\n\n\"Get ready for weather-scapegoating,\" he said.\n\nCould rain be good for Republicans?\n\nRain certainly will have an impact on the election, but to what extent is unknown.\n\n\"Drizzle drives a few people away from the polls; a heavy downpour keeps a whole bunch of them away,\" Larry Powell, pollster and professor of political communications at the University of Alabama Birmingham, told Weather.com.\n\nPowell says campaign organizers pay close attention to weather in races, and will often organize transportation to take voters to the polls if they're hesitant to drive themselves.\n\nHe went on to say that inclement weather tends to favor the incumbent.\n\n\"Sunny days benefit the challengers more than the incumbents,\" he said. \"The incumbent voters are going to get to the polls regardless.\"\n\nSome scientific research also suggests that Republicans have an edge in bad weather.\n\nA study first conducted in 2015 and revised last month from researchers at Dartmouth College and the Australian National University showed that at least 1% of voting-age adults who would have voted blue if the weather had been good, voted Republican instead on rainy election days.\n\n\"Our study suggests that weather conditions may affect people's decisions on not only whether to vote but also who they vote for,\" Dartmouth government Professor Yusaku Horiuchi, a co-author of the study, said in a news release.\n\nA separate study from 2007, conducted by Florida State University, also found a Republican advantage on rainy election days.\n\nBut the lead author of the study, political scientist Greg Gomez, said that the correlation is more pronounced in presidential elections.\n\nGomez told Weather.com that the midterms are different since they are disproportionately composed of \"core voters\" who are usually more partisan and less susceptible to changing their mind.\n\n\"We would expect that bad weather is a bigger deterrent to voting in presidential elections than in midterm elections; midterm electorates simply are composed of a larger percentage of core voters who are determined to vote rain or shine,\" Gomez said.\n\nHe also says that more states now hold early voting, which wasn't the case when his study was conducted.\n\nBut this year's elections are looking more like a presidential election with possible record turnout for a midterm year, so it remains to be seen how the weather will affect the results.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the forecasts in 40 key races:\n\nHOUSE\n\nAll temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit and according to Weather.com's forecast.\n\nCalifornia's 10th \u2014 Incumbent Rep.

Called \"Navigate on Autopilot,\" it enables a Tesla vehicle that's equipped with the requisite set of sensors, cameras, and radars \u2014 and that's had \"Enhanced Autopilot\" enabled for $5,000 \u2014 to drive the car through a greater range of situations than before and to follow a route in the GPS navigation system.\n\nI met up with several Tesla representatives and their brand-new Model 3 sedan in New Jersey to sampled the upgrade.\n\nI'll cut to the chase. For years now, I've argued that Tesla Autopilot should be a hands-on-the-wheel-at-all-times technology, and that Tesla shouldn't let a new owner or lessee leave the store without an \"Autopilot 101\" tutorial. In practice, Autopilot does prompt drivers to periodically engage in steering-wheel inputs when Autopilot is active. But drivers can release the wheel for brief stretches.\n\nRead more: I drove a $57,500 Tesla Model 3 for a week to see if it's practical for everyday driving \u2014 here's the verdict\n\nI'll get into how Navigate on Autopilot works in a second. For now, the best thing about the new technology is that it raises the level of engagement required of the driver. The biggest risk of Autopilot and other semi-self-driving systems is that they reduce situational awareness, quickly removing drivers from the act of fully controlling their vehicles. Navigate on Autopilot brings situational awareness back.\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nTouch the blue button. Tesla\n\nWell, for starters, it has to be enabled (by the way, I sampled the tech in New Jersey, but these images are from a drive in California and were provided by Tesla).\n\nThat's achieved via (in my case) the Model 3's central touchscreen. Once you give it the OK and input a route through the navigation system, Navigate on Autopilot will become active when Autopilot itself is in operation, and it's only available for highway operation. You have to touch the blue \"Navigate on Autopilot\" button on the turn-by-turn directions to make it work.\n\nAt a basic level, Navigate on Autopilot can drive a Tesla up a highway on-ramp, suggest lane changes and passing maneuvers while it follows a plotted route, and it can exit a highway prior to returning control to the driver. This makes Autopilot somewhat more \"point-to-point\" than it was before, and as CEO Elon Musk has noted, is a needed step toward full self-driving capability.\n\nLane changes are suggested by a gray line. Tesla\n\nNOAP, as I'll refer to it, benefits from a high level of fleet learning, and, as with anything a Tesla with the right sensor set has encountered, can be used to manage merging speeds and take a more intelligent approach to things like pre-exit lane changes.\n\nNOAP will also suggest or deny passing maneuvers, and the boldness with which it approaches those moves can be set anywhere from Mild to \"Mad Max,\" for impatient drivers (Average in between.)\n\nA double-pull-down of the transmission stalk on the right side of the Model 3's steering wheel brings Autopilot online, and we're off. Pretty quickly, the systems take over steering for an on-ramp, modulating speed to keep everything safe. I then have to increase the preset adaptive cruise-control speed to a highway velocity \u2014 and respond to the Autopilot prompts when it's time to provide a bit of steering-wheel engagement.\n\nThe red line means no-go for a lane change. Tesla\n\nThe Autopilot screen, on the far-left side of the central touchscreen, draws a blue line in front of the vehicle, mimicking the route guidance on the navigation system. When a slow-moving truck appears in front of us, NOAP suggest a passing maneuver and draws it in gray. It's then up to me to confirm that it's safe to pass and use the turn signal to execute.\n\nIf an obstacle shows up on the Tesla's sensor range \u2014 such as another vehicle off our starboard side \u2014 NOAP creates a red line that prohibits the pass.\n\nThen, when it's time to line up in a lane for exiting, NOAP also offers that indication. When it hits the exit, it slows for the curve, then returns control for slower driving (it gives the driver a distance countdown).\n\nNav on Autopilot gives you a distance countdown before its deactivates. Tesla\n\nOn balance, I can do all of this more seamlessly myself, but it's early days for this type of semi-autonomous technology. For now, NOAP is fairly impressive for what it can do, and more importantly, for how much safety it brings to the process.\n\nWhat it can't do\n\nWhat it can't do is mainly apply old-fashioned driving habits, learned by me decades ago \u2014 such as changing lanes to the left around on-ramp merges to allow new traffic onto the highway. Or to shift to the left when stopped cars or emergency vehicles are on the shoulder. Those are very, very human situations, however. I wouldn't expect a self-driving car with far more advanced aspirations that a Tesla using NOAP to be able to handle them.\n\nA human situation that NOAP goes a long way toward improving is simply dealing with following a route. Even with modern GPS, it's easy to screw up, miss a turn, and end up frustrated. NOAP alleviates some of that stress. Add this to Autopilot's already noted ability to deal with slow, stop-and-go traffic and you have a helpful, stress-reducing technology that will likely alleviate mishaps.\n\nI'm not really a heavy-duty Autopilot user, mainly because I like actually driving Teslas too much (to be fair, I don't make much use of old-school cruise control unless I'm on long highway jaunts). For Autopilot enthusiasts, I can easily see how NOAP will initially demand a learning curve, but over the long term will prevent the temptation to let the system take over too much of the driving act.\n\nThat's a big deal. NOAP definitely improved Autopilot, but also fixes what I think is the technology's main drawback.", "The Tennessee Titans took down the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium Monday night, but early on it looked as though the Cowboys could run away with the game.\n\nWith a 7-0 lead and the ball on Tennessee's 6-yard line, Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott dropped back and lofted a pass for newly-minted Cowboy wide receiver Amari Cooper into the back of the end zone. Instead, Titans safety Kevin Byard came away with the interception to keep the game within one score.\n\nThe former Middle Tennessee star \u2014 who led the NFL with eight interceptions last season \u2014 then invoked Hall of Fame wide receiver Terrell Owens in his celebration. Byard ran to the 50-yard line, stood at the center of the Dallas star, and stretched out his arms before dancing on the Cowboys emblem with his teammates.\n\nRead more: Seahawks' synchronized touchdown dance might be the best celebration of the NFL season\n\nThe six-time Pro Bowl selection \u2014 who spent three years of his career playing in Dallas \u2014 took to Twitter to express his approval of Byard's antics.\n\nThis isn't the first time this week that a current star paid homage to NFL players of yore. After breaking the New Orleans Saints' single-game receiving yards record against the then-undefeated Los Angeles Rams, wide receiver Michael Thomas pulled a flip phone out from under the field goal post in an ode to former Saints wide receiver Joe Horn. Horn was fined $30,000 for the same celebration in 2003.\n\nIn both cases, the announcers were not fond of the celebrations. Troy Aikman reprimanded Thomas multiple times for his cell phone bit while calling the game for FOX. Then, former Cowboys tight end Jason Witten, who is now a broadcaster for ESPN on \"Monday Night Football,\" complained that Byard's move was disrespectful.\n\n\"Yeah, that's a little bit of disrespect,\" Witten said, per Jon Machota of SportsDay. \"They're driving the ball down the field. Nice play by Byard, but I don't know that you want to do that... He's in his third year, okay? Do it about five more years, and then, you know, get seven or eight interceptions a year, maybe you can do it at that point. But until then, I'd probably stay away from the star.\"", "On paper, it seems almost like career suicide to take over a franchise that was once overseen by an auteur like David Fincher. But in a short time, Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez has proven he's never looked to play it safe.\n\nYou only have to go back to his feature debut to see that. In 2013, he remade one of the most iconic horror movies of all time, Sam Rami's \"Evil Dead,\" and didn't get kicked out of town for doing it.\n\nNow following his 2016 hit horror, \"Don't Breathe,\" he returns to the pressure of taking on a well-known property. With Fincher walking away from making a sequel to his 2011 thriller \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" \u2014 the first American adaptation of the popular Millennium book series from the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson \u2014 Sony has enlisted Alvarez to give the franchise a reboot. \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\" (opening in theaters Friday) skips to the fourth book in the franchise and replaces Fincher's moody dark thriller vibe for an action suspense story and a new lead. Claire Foy, known best for her Emmy-winning performance as Queen Elizabeth II on Netflix's \"The Crown,\" takes over playing the franchise star Lisbeth Salander from Rooney Mara, who played the role in Fincher's movie.\n\nIn \"Spider's Web\" Foy still plays Salander as a computer-hacking renegade who avenges abused women, but unlike \"Dragon Tattoo,\" she's now the center of the story with journalist Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig in the Fincher movie, though he didn't come back for this one either) in the background. And this time, the stakes are higher, as Salander must retrieve a program that can access the world's nuclear codes before her evil twin sister, Camilla (Sylvia Hoeks), gets it.\n\nBusiness Insider talked to Alvarez about making a soft reboot for a franchise that barely got off the ground, why he never met with Rooney Mara to see if she wanted to continue playing the Salander role, and the reason he'll feel like a failure if everyone likes the movie.\n\nJason Guerrasio: What fascinated you about the project when it came to you?\n\nFede Alvarez: It was the character of Lisbeth Salander above all things. Obviously, it's a very special character. It's one that when I saw it for the first time, probably the first Swedish movie, you fall in love right away. She confronts you with all your prejudice in a way because when you see her you never expect to really encounter the character you will eventually in the story. It's someone that's as three dimensional as they get. That's one part and I think the other part is it wasn't the second book or third book, it wasn't a continuation of the last American movie. It was the fourth book by a different author (David Lagercrantz took over the series following the death of Larsson) and it's been eight years since the last movie. It was the right moment to say I can just do whatever I want to do with it and I can make it my own film.\n\nClaire Foy in \"The Girl in the Spider's Web.\" Sony Guerrasio: So when they came to you they said they wanted to focus on the fourth book? That's how it was pitched to you?\n\nAlvarez: Yeah. If they'd said they wanted to make the second book, I would have said no. No way. I would never have even tried to continue Fincher's story with my eye because we make different movies. I make pulpier movies. If someone wants a very dark classic thriller then they should go and rewatch his movie.\n\nGuerrasio: In regards to Lisbeth, what were you walking into? Was Rooney still going to be involved?\n\nAlvarez: Sony deferred to me, in a way. If I remember correctly, if they brought back Rooney they would basically bring back the whole cast. If you bring one you bring back the whole universe. And casting is a big part of the director's job and I never make a movie where I don't write it. I write all my films. So with that approach I also have to cast the movie. I cannot take someone else's cast. It would be wrong for me to just use actors that are someone else's vision of the characters. In some franchises it's totally necessary but for this I didn't believe it was.\n\nRead more:The highest-paid TV stars make over $1 million per episode\n\nGuerrasio: That all being said, Rooney commented in the past that she was still interested in playing the character, did you talk to her and get a sense if you two could work together?\n\nAlvarez: No. I never had that conversation. I think she would not have done it without Fincher. That's my feeling.\n\nGuerrasio: Tell me how you came to casting Claire as your Lisbeth.\n\nAlvarez: Normally the process is to start auditioning people. Have them come in for readings. At least that's how I do it. To really open it up to anybody. Even looking at the young actors who just landed in Hollywood. And I think we did some of that in the beginning of this. But then I saw Claire in \"The Crown\" and I felt right away that this is the actor to play this role.\n\nGuerrasio: That's interesting, even her playing the Queen of England, all prim and proper, you could see that she could play Lisbeth Slander?\n\nAlvarez: Yeah. Because a director should not look at the superficial. You don't look at the clothes or how they speak or move. You look beyond that, you have to. And what I saw is this is someone that is really trying to keep feelings to her own and trying to be secretive of how she really feels because as the Queen she's not allowed often to express how she really feels. I felt the person to play Lisbeth Slander, a character that doesn't open up and doesn't share feelings, you need an actor who has a technique and has a craft that is so good that you're able to have a window into her soul.\n\nSwedish actor Sverrir Gudnason as Mikael Blomkvist in \"The Girl in the Spider's Web.\" Sony Guerrasio: I will be honest, the casting of Mikael was very strange for me. I would assume you would want a known actor for that part. Can you explain why you went with lesser-known Swedish actor Sverrir Gudnason for the role?\n\nAlvarez: In the first movies, both the American and Swedish, although Lisbeth Salander is the most interesting character in them she's not the lead, the lead is Mikael Blomkvist. He's your way in, he's the character you love and know and understand everything. Lisbeth is a muse, is someone that he's following. But those movies are not about her. So for such a feminist icon as Lisbeth I felt like we cannot do that to her again, this has to be her movie. She has to be in the front. Do we need Mikael in the movie? Yes. You can't adapt a Millennium book without him, but I wanted to make sure he would not overshadow her. And that's when you write off any big star. The star would not just take that screen attention but the star will usually demand more screen time and perhaps even ask to change the story so he's more present in the movie. And that's not what I wanted. I wanted Mikael Blomkvist to be what many female co-leads have been for too long, the damsel in distress. I wanted him to be that. He's the one stuck with the kid in the end while she goes out and saves the world. [laughs]\n\nGuerrasio: A conscious decision, but did you have to sell that to Sony?\n\nAlvarez: Not really. No. I've been lucky that all the movies I've made I managed to make them with total independence and creative freedom. I just work with studios and producers that trust me and my decisions and support what I do. I don't go to those other Hollywood movies that you are just hired to do your part and it's more studio control. I don't do that. I've never done those and I'm going to keep trying to avoid those.\n\n\"The Girl in the Spider's Web\" director Fede Alvarez. Sony Guerrasio: This is not the first soft reboot you've done. You also directed the 2013 \"Evil Dead.\" Did you take anything from that experience and put it into making \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\"?\n\nAlvarez: With \"Evil Dead,\" people loved it or hated it and that's something I do with my movies. I never try to please the whole theater. If I do I think I've failed, that I played it too safe. I always expect some portion of the theater to walk out pissed. Either feeling offended or the movie did something that rubbed them the wrong way. I always look for that. What I learned from that was if I'm faithful to the spirit of the material then eventually it would be okay. The perception of \"The Girl in the Spider's Web,\" at the moment because of the comparisons, you always start on the wrong foot.

Meaning, you didn't write something a certain way or shoot something a certain way because you felt Fincher would do it that way.\n\nAlvarez: No. Now, he is an executive producer on this film, but I have never met him or had any conversation with him. That's unfortunate, because I'm a big fan of his work. But no. Directors tend to have a singular vision of how things should be, at least I am. I feel there's only one way to do it and I try to capture that. So there's really no time to think like that. I knew that the tone would be so different and the style and plot that I didn't have to worry about that. So even if a shot is similar accidentally, or even on purpose a shot looks like a Fincher shot, hey, that's a good problem to have. [laughs] He's a master of the craft.

The speed of the free shipping is between five and eight business days. This offer took effect on November 5 and will run until Amazon can no longer promise items in time for Christmas with free delivery.\n\nThis promotion from Amazon further intensifies the competitive landscape that's been heating up as the holiday season approaches. Target announced at the end of last month that it would be making free no-minimum, two-day shipping available to all customers, and Walmart expanded free two-day shipping (with a $35 minimum) to millions of items from third-party sellers. It's certainly possible that Amazon's announcement comes as a reactionary measure.\n\nAmazon's free five- to eight-day shipping for non-Prime members is slower than Target's and Walmart's offerings, but this may not cost Amazon too many sales. When asked whether free or fast shipping is more important, 88% of consumers preferred free shipping, suggesting that it may not be a big problem if Amazon ships more slowly, as long as it does so for free.\n\nAdditionally, a sizable subset of those surveyed, 40%, explicitly indicated that they would be willing to wait five to seven days for free shipping \u2014 almost the exact range that this promotion falls into \u2014 and another 12% said they would even wait one to two weeks. Moreover, free two-day shipping is a major benefit of Prime membership, and the e-tailer may be trying to avoid devaluing the subscription service by giving away one of its biggest perks for free.\n\nPreparations for the upcoming holiday season have been particularly competitive. This has been especially true for the toy market since the closure of Toys \"R\" Us. Target is adding a staggering 250,000 square feet of new space for toys across 500 stores as well as \"25,000+ hours of fun and giveaways,\" while Amazon is planning to distribute a physical toy catalog and Walmart is boosting its toy inventory and adding content from toy influencers to Walmart.com.\n\nWhile toys do not make up all holiday season sales, it's possible that the available toy market share has stoked the competitive fire and led to these escalating moves to offer the best holiday shopping experience.", "San Francisco billionaires are warring over a controversial ballot measure that would tax the city's largest corporations to fund services for the homeless.\n\nIn late October, Salesforce chairman Marc Benioff came out in support of the measure, known as Proposition C, claiming that homelessness was an even bigger threat to his business than a \"small tax.\"\n\n\"This crisis reminds us that business does not exist in a bubble,\" Benioff wrote in a New York Times editorial. \"Companies can truly thrive only when our communities succeed as well.\"\n\nIf Prop C is passed on Tuesday, it would raise taxes on gross annual receipts \u2014 or total income, before subtracting costs or expenses \u2014 for the top 1% of large corporations in San Francisco. These taxes could garner an additional $300 million for programs like mental health services or shelter beds for the homeless. Half of the funds will also go toward the construction and renovation of 4,000 affordable homes.\n\nBoth Square CEO Jack Dorsey and Stripe CEO Patrick Collison worry that the proposition unfairly targets businesses that are much smaller than Salesforce.\n\n\"Prop C is the dumbest, least thought out prop ever,\" Zynga co-founder Marc Pincus tweeted in early November. \"Please get the facts and vote no.\"\n\nAccording to United Nations Special Rapporteur Leilani Farha, the city's lack of taxation is \"part of the problem.\"\n\nIn January, Farha went on an unofficial mission to explore homeless encampments in San Francisco and Oakland. There, she encountered disturbing sights of rats digging through mud and streets littered with trash, feces, and discarded needles. The conditions prompted her to label San Francisco's crisis a \"human rights violation,\" equal to some of the poorest parts of Delhi and Mumbai.\n\n\"Since I've been rapporteur for the last four years, I've had three experiences that shook me to my core,\" Farha told Business Insider. \"One of them was in San Francisco.\"\n\nBecause Farha sees housing as a human right, not a commodity, she said it's up to the government to solve the problem. Under international human rights law, governments are required to take reasonable steps to address human rights' need using the \"maximum available resources.\" That includes proper taxation, Farha said.\n\n\"Cities and states and national governments have less money than they used to,\" she said. \"They need more money, and the only way they can get more money is through taxation.\"\n\n\"People always say, 'Oh we're going to build our way out of the housing problem,'\" she adds. \"But it's not always that there isn't [housing] stock. It's that the stock that's available is being eaten up by investors right, left, and center.\"\n\nThough Farha doesn't point the finger exclusively at tech firms, she does feel they should be willing to surrender a small portion of their wealth.\n\nBenioff's editorial in the Times, she said, was an example of that. \"I find it very helpful that he's come out [in support of a homelessness tax],\" she said.\n\nWhile some have criticized the tax as an attempt to throw money at a structural problem, Farha said money is critical to identifying and addressing the root causes of homelessness \u2014 namely, a lack of affordable homes.\n\n\"Money is part of the equation here,\" she said. \"Political will is part of the equation, too.\"", "AP Photo/Richard Vogel\n\nAmericans went to the polls Tuesday, with two states voting on legalizing recreational marijuana and another two more deciding the fate of medical marijuana.\n\nWeed stocks are gaining around on Tuesday.\n\nSo far in the US, nine states and Washington, DC allow recreational marijuana while 31 states and Washington, DC allow medical marijuana, but marijuana is not allowed at a federal level.\n\nIn October, Canada became the second country after Uruguay to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.\n\nWeed stocks were surging Tuesday as Americans in four states will determine the fate of marijuana use at a state level.\n\nVoters in Michigan and North Dakota are considering the full recreational use of marijuana for individuals over the age of 21.

Fifty-one percent of US B2B payments are still made using paper checks. That's largely due to the simplicity of checks, which only require knowing a billing address, as opposed to other payment types, which require account numbers and other credentials, Flint Lane, CEO and founder of Billtrust told Business Insider Intelligence. Non-check payment methods can become complicated when dealing with thousands of suppliers, which has contributed to the endurance of paper checks.\n\nAnd there are several barriers to the adoption of existing digital solutions.Managing both the payable and receivable ends of B2B transactions has made them complicated, costly, and often fraud filled\u2014 in turn making them slow to digitize. And the ubiquity of check acceptance also contributes to its heavy use in B2B payments. But the lack of connectivity on existing B2B payment platforms is the largest hurdle to adoption among businesses. Taira Hall, VP of partnerships and new initiatives at Visa Business Solutions, told Business Insider Intelligence that BPN reduces the inherent friction between buyers and suppliers by making payment information available, which will allow businesses to access necessary information needed to use digital payments. This facilitates B2B payments, which can effectively move merchants away from check usage.", "AP Photo/Andy Wong\n\nChina's economy in the third quarter grew at its slowest pace in a decade.\n\nBut even after the US and China placed hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on each other, exports have held up better than expected.\n\nEconomists attribute the slowdown in part to a deleveraging campaign started last year.\n\nAs the Chinese economy slows, economists say trade tensions are only part of the equation.\n\nGross domestic product in China expanded at its weakest pace in nearly a decade from July through September, with growth in the manufacturing sector slowing to a near standstill.

I'm Harris Faulkner. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo...Narrator: Harris Faulkner is the host of \"Outnumbered Overtime\" on Fox News Channel.Faulkner: Great to see you, Congressman. You know, the big question today...Narrator: The show airs Monday through Friday at 1:00 PM Eastern. Faulkner is the only African-American woman that hosts a daily show for one of the three major cable news networks. On MSNBC and CNN, there are daily shows hosted by African-American men, with Craig Melvin and Don Lemon, respectively. But on those networks, African-American women only host broadcasts that air on the weekends.Faulkner: When Fox committed to giving me an hour of television, I said, \"Oh my gosh I'm gonna be like,\" and I looked for those faces. I'm curious when I look across the dial Monday through Friday, you know, where are the other female black anchors? It's a tremendous amount of responsibility.Narrator: Faulkner joined the network in 2005. She became cohost of the midday show \"Outnumbered\" in 2014, and she got her own show three years later with \"Outnumbered Overtime.\"Faulkner: This is the first edition of \"Outnumbered Overtime.\"Narrator: The show's first episode aired the day after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas.Faulkner: Of course, we're gonna cover this story moment by moment.Jay Soroko: Harris does breaking news better than just about anybody in the business. She understands the stories, she knows how to help the audience understand what's really important and what we need to learn and where we need to go with the story.Faulkner: How's it going? My day starts with the rose gold folder. We start out pretty early on an editorial call in the morning, and then we build this blueprint of the show, and now I'm ready to rock and roll.Narrator: Faulkner's career didn't begin at Fox News.Faulkner: I want to draw your attention to these big, four-foot deep \u2014 they would have been in the ground. This is cement.Narrator: She worked her way up the local news food chain as a reporter and anchor.Faulkner: Getting into network television was tougher than I thought it was gonna be. Welcome back to \"A Current Affair.\"Narrator: Her first national job was hosting the syndicated news magazine show \"A Current Affair,\" and she gained notoriety for her coverage of the disappearance of Natalee Holloway.Sean Hannity: With details is Harris Faulkner, the reporter for \"A Current Affair.\" Harris thanks for being with us.Faulkner: That was my entree into Fox News Channel. I was on as a guest correspondent with Sean Hannity. The show got canceled, they wanted to keep me, and boom. Here I am at Fox News Channel doing some cut-ins at night, news updates, so that's, that was my entree here. Congressman, thanks for sticking for the breaking news. It's fabulously fun for me personally as a journalist because it's in real time, things are unfolding.Narrator: While Faulkner's \"Outnumbered Overtime\" show is news-driven, the show she cohosts, \"Outnumbered,\" encourages opinion. And in 2017, one of hers made headlines. After the deadly violence in Charlottesville, President Trump was criticized for his initial statement.President Trump: We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides, on many sides.Narrator: After intense blowback, Trump made another statement two days later.Trump: Racism is evil, and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.Narrator: And this is how Faulkner responded.Faulkner: I would say this about the president's critics as a whole. If nothing will quiet them, then they don't have America in their sights. They don't care about us. They don't care about Americans, and shame on them.Narrator: Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple described Faulkner's comments as \"pro-Trump shilling.\" In June of 2018, President Trump posted a tweet promoting Faulkner's book about growing up as a military brat. Faulkner responded with a tweet thanking the president that has been pinned to her profile ever since.Graham Flanagan: I have a few examples of things that you've said or tweeted that might conflict with what many people's perception might be of what an African-American woman might say or tweet, and I just want to ask you a few examples of these.Faulkner: By the way, those probably happen all the time because we're not all alike. I don't speak for all black people, and I hope that others don't speak for me. We're all different, we all come with our own points of view. To get a presidential tweet from the Commander-in-Chief about a military book that you've written is pretty awesome. And it wouldn't matter where that person's politics would be, it's the President of the United States. But that's not because I'm black that people give me negative feedback because the president tweeted about my book. They do it because they think that it's all about politics.Narrator: Recently, Faulkner has called out the president. She had strong words for President Trump when he cast doubt on the death toll of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.Faulkner: No, it cheapens us as a country. To have that be the conversation right now. I think one of the complicating factors when you talk about death and loss and all of that, is that it becomes about the numbers and not about the people. I don't understand politically why anybody would even wade into that, whether it's the president or anybody else. Let's let the science figure that out. His hats say \"Make America great again.\" And I look at how that doesn't fit the comments that you're saying about Puerto Rico. It makes it sound like we're not quite where we need to be, and it does cheapen us, and when the things don't match up, I call it. Now, this is the part where we go upstairs.Flanagan: Do you like working at Fox News?Faulkner: I love it. If I didn't want to be here, I wouldn't be here. I hope that people look at me and think that I'm good at my job. I also encourage myself on a daily basis to do my job in such a way that it would encourage others to hire people who look like me.

But when they found out that a coworker in a similar role earned more, they were inclined to start slacking off.\n\nThe study took place at a large commercial bank in Asia, and involved about 2,000 employees at all levels of the organization. Through an online survey, researchers asked employees to guess the salaries of their managers' salaries; they offered rewards for accuracy.\n\nAbout half the employees were then given the correct, higher number; the other half were not given the correct number.\n\nIn the year that followed, the researchers analyzed company data on when the employees clocked in and out of work, their email activity, and sales performance (and yes, it's kind of creepy that the company was tracking all this).\n\nResults showed that employees who found out their manager was paid 10% more than they thought subsequently spent 1.5% more hours in the office, sent 1.3% more emails, and sold 1.1% more. These numbers were even higher for employees who learned the salary of managers relatively close to them in the corporate pecking order. It's as though learning how much your boss (or their boss) earns gives you something to aspire to.\n\nOn the other hand, employees who found out their peer was paid 10% more subsequently spent 9.4% fewer hours in the office, sent 4.3% fewer emails, and sold 7.3% less.\n\nWe're inclined to feel worse about work after learning that we're paid less than coworkers\n\nThis study appears to be the first to test the effects of learning your manager's salary. Other research has looked at the effects of finding out coworkers' compensation.\n\nA 2011 study, for example, led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Princeton University found that employees who discover they're on the lower end of the salary range are more likely to start looking for new jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, a PayScale study, described in HBR, found that found most people have no clue whether they're paid fairly. Case in point: Two-thirds of people who are being paid the market rate believe they are in fact underpaid.\n\nRead more: 'They got a $2 million raise last year?': Netflix lets any exec or director see what employees make, and people are freaking out\n\nInterestingly, the PayScale study also found that people feel more positive about work when their company communicates clearly about compensation \u2014 for example, by explaining to an employee why they're paid lower than market rate.\n\nThat lines up with what Elena Belogolovsky, who was an assistant professor of human resource studies at Cornell University, previously told me.\n\n\"You don't have to disclose [salary] information for every single person in the company,\" she said. \"But what you need to do is make the system more transparent.

And Yahoo Finance reported that Walmart would launch only 10 new supercenters in 2019.\n\nBy Walmart's standards, that's \"virtually nothing,\" according to the Morgan Stanley executive director Simeon Gutman.\n\n\"The growth engine of this company was opening big, 200,000-square-foot boxes,\" Gutman told Business Insider. \"That era is over.\"\n\nBut Gutman also told Business Insider that the decline of new supercenters was \"not unexpected.\"\n\nIn the United States, Walmart operates 5,358 retail units. A whopping 3,565 of those stores are supercenters. Gutman pointed out that there were more supercenters than counties in the US, which boasts 3,142 counties and county-equivalents.\n\n\"They've filled out their footprint,\" Gutman said. \"They don't need more. In the US, we don't really need more physical boxes from almost any retailer.\"'\n\nA representative for Walmart did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nIndustry experts have seen this supercenter saturation coming for a while. In the 2012 book \"Walmart: Key Insights and Practical Lessons from the World's Largest Retailer,\" the authors Natalie Berg and Bryan Roberts predicted that while the supercenter was the \"backbone of Walmart's business,\" markets like the US could support only so many new supercenters opening going forward.\n\n\"For the American supercenter, time is quickly running out,\" Berg and Roberts wrote.\n\nBut according to Gutman, that fact that Walmart isn't opening a ton of new supercenters doesn't mean its supercenters are becoming irrelevant. He dubbed the supercenter Walmart's \"center of gravity,\" saying the massive big-box stores would provide crucial infrastructure for Walmart's expanding click-and-collect program.\n\n\"We think the foot traffic to these big boxes will likely decline, and therefore there's got to be better ways to use your space,\" Gutman said. \"As the shift to online continues, then using your physical space to supplement your e-commerce business is probably the right strategy.\"", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Whether you're suffering from back pain and looking for a mattress with more support, or memory foam just isn't your jam, the Saatva line of mattresses are a great solution if you prefer a more traditional innerspring feel.\n\nThere are three comfort levels to choose from: Plush Soft, Luxury Firm, and Firm. The Luxury Firm is touted as their best-selling model, so I put it to the test to see if it lived up to the promise of providing a \"perfect balance of comfort with support\" that \"assures proper spinal alignment.\"\n\nWhile anything would have been a step up from the pillow-top hand-me-down mattress we had been sleeping on, I was definitely impressed with both the quality of the Saatva Luxury Firm and the comfort it provided, as well as the customer service.\n\nThe white glove delivery service and the offer to remove our old mattress at no extra charge was a nice touch. We decided to hold on to our old mattress for the time being, but the delivery guys were happy to move it to another bedroom of our home. If you do plan on moving this mattress, it's definitely a two-person job as the coil-on-coil construction does give it more heft than a memory foam mattress.\n\nAs first impressions go, the Luxury Firm made a great one. As soon as my boyfriend and I laid down, we noticed the mattress was comfortable, yet supportive. It doesn't allow you to sink in like a memory foam mattress would, but this is a great option for those who prefer the feeling of being suspended on top of the mattress. The support didn't waver, even as I rolled over toward the edge of the mattress, which is ideal if you plan to share this with a significant other. There is some motion transference with the Luxury Firm, but most times it wasn't noticeable enough for me to wake up in the middle of the night as my partner rolled over \u2014 which says a lot since I'm a light sleeper. After testing this for several weeks, our initial impression didn't change.\n\nSaatva Mattress\n\nThere's no doubt that this mattress has changed the way we both sleep.\n\nThe \"Goldilocks\" combination of comfort and support is largely thanks to the multiple layers that make up this mattress. It starts with a base of steel coils, and on top of this are individually wrapped \"comfort coils\" that are designed to respond and contour to the body. This gives the mattress its responsive feel, and helps promote airflow throughout the mattress so if you do sleep hot, you shouldn't be overheating during the night. These are covered with a layer of memory foam to provide pressure relief and reduce stress in the lower back. Foam-encased edge support creates a supportive surface no matter where you lay. All of this is topped off with an organic cotton euro pillow top that provides additional comfort without taking away from the firm feel of support.\n\nWe can both speak to the decrease in back pain we've both felt since using this mattress.\n\nMy boyfriend, who sleeps religiously on his back, says, \"My back pain is gone and this has completely eliminated the 2 to 3 a.m. wake-ups I used to have in the night.\" I'm typically a restless sleeper, but I've found I definitely sleep more soundly through the night, and I've been able to sleep on my stomach (my preferred sleep position) all through the night with no discomfort. The Luxury Firm is designed to be compatible with different sleeping styles. Some side sleepers may find the Luxury Firm to be a bit too hard for their liking, so the Plush Soft may be a better option if you're looking for a softer mattress but don't want to give up that innerspring feel.\n\nIt comes as no surprise why the Luxury Firm is the best-seller \u2014 and we aren't the only ones who love this mattress.\n\nSleepopolis says, \"By combining the coil-on-coil structure with the quilted cover, Saatva has created a feeling akin to that of a mattress in a high-end hotel.\"\n\nThis reviewer from Mattress Clarity praises the quality as well as the value saying, \"Considering the durable construction and high-quality materials, this is quite the value. If you're looking for a long-lasting mattress but don't want to break the bank, the Saatva could be the mattress for you.\"\n\nSome added bonuses?\n\nSaatva is an eco-conscious company that uses environmentally friendly materials for all of their mattresses, and they're also made in the USA. Each mattress comes with a 15-year warranty, and Saatva also offers a 120-night sleep trial. If you do find the Luxury Firm isn't right for you, you can return it with no questions asked.

Below, I will look at what style options are available, how they performed, and whether you should consider picking up a pair.\n\nMy first experiences with the Zensah Compression Leg Sleeves\n\nZensah offers three sizes of leg sleeves based on the circumference of your calf at its thickest point while at rest. Extra-Small/Small is meant for calves 9.5\" to 12.5\" in circumference. Small/Medium is for 12.5\" to 15\". And, Large/Extra-Large is designed for calves between 15\" and 18.5\" round. Thanks to a lifetime of leg days, I have 17\" calves and chose the Large/Extra-Large. These sleeves are 11\" long, while the other two sizes are 9.5\" long.\n\nIt's important to choose compression wear that looks good and fits your style so that you will be motivated to wear it. Fortunately, Zensah currently offers 42 different style options, including neon pink, navy, white, and a fun beer mug pattern. They sent me black, which isn't exciting but goes well with just about any outfit.\n\nThe materials vary drastically depending on whether you choose a solid color or heather color. The sleeves I tested are 90% nylon and 10% spandex. This \"Zensah Fabric\" is designed to regulate your temperature, keep away odors, and wick moisture. And, in my experience, the sleeves delivered on all of these claims.\n\nThe sleeves provide graduated compression \u2014 they're tighter at the bottom than at the top. The raised \"micro-ribbing\" targets and stabilizes the calf muscles. And, when you order these sleeves from Amazon, you can return them for free within 30 days of your purchase. This is helpful if they don't fit right.\n\nHow the compression leg sleeves performed\n\nThe L/XL fit great. It hugged my calf snuggly and provided compression from just above the ankles to just below the knee. Like any good compression wear, it took a little bit of elbow grease to get the sleeves on, but they would stay in place.\n\nI wore the leg sleeves while cycling and during roller derby bouts. During one cycling workout, I set a personal best one-mile split time. In roller derby, I wore them in my first bout back after a knee injury and performed well enough to receive a player of the game award. My background in science won't allow me to say these performances were the product of the leg sleeves, but they may have helped.\n\nI like wearing compression leg sleeves rather than compression socks during competition because any slight difference in how my skates fit can lead to blisters and affect my ability to make micro adjustments in my movements. Consequently, I always wear thin socks made of a cotton/polyester/spandex blend. Compression socks are usually thicker and made of other materials. I appreciated that the sleeves allowed me to wear whatever socks I wanted.\n\nThe leg sleeves appear to be quite durable. The pair I tested didn't get any holes, loose threads, or fade. Though Zensah recommends machine washing cold and tumble drying, I'm not sophisticated enough to separate my laundry so I washed and dried the sleeves with my other clothes on medium heat. I don't recommend doing this if you want to extend the life of your sleeves, but after about a dozen washes, I didn't notice any negative effects on the performance and appearance of the sleeves.\n\nSome concerns about the leg sleeves\n\nThough I had a just-right fit, this won't be the case for everyone. If you are especially short and have thick calves or are incredibly tall and have narrow calves, you may have a hard time finding a Zensah size that fits you. The sleeves designed for your calf circumference may be too long or too short for your lower leg, which leads to a less than optimal fit. Fortunately, if the sleeves don't fit, you can get a refund.\n\nZensah does not appear to give a compression rating for the leg sleeves. I mention this because some consumers find this number useful, though personal fit, construction, and material can cause two sleeves with the same compression rating to feel drastically different.\n\nBottom line\n\nIf you're looking to get a leg up on the competition, the Zensah Compression Leg Sleeves may be worth a try. It's hard to say if they improved my performance compared to not having sleeves. But, I didn't notice any significant muscle fatigue while wearing them.\n\nIf you suffer from shin splints, calf cramps, or you notice lower-leg fatigue affecting your athletic performance, I recommend giving the Zensah Compression Leg Sleeves a shot.", "Engineer.AI, a startup that seeks to help anyone create custom software, has raised $29.5 million in its first round of funding, led by Lakestar Ventures, Jungle Ventures, and SoftBank's Deepcore fund.\n\nThe series A raise is notable for its size and for SoftBank's involvement. The Japanese firm has made waves by pouring money into startups through its $100 billion Vision Fund, but it also has the newly established $52 million Deepcore fund.\n\nAccording to Engineer.AI's cofounder Sachin Dev Duggal, this is Deepcore's first non-Japanese investment. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nEngineer.AI's key product is its Builder tool, which targets people who want to create an app, e-commerce site, marketplace, or website for their business but don't have the technical know-how or budget to commission developers and designers to build something bespoke. Duggal gives the example of someone who runs a French ski school with 200 instructors and wants a site and an app that connect the different systems but can't afford the requisite $500,000 for custom software.\n\nEngineer.AI\n\nWhat is particularly clever about Engineer.AI is its efficiency. It reuses building blocks of code across its clients' different apps or services, meaning there's often no need to code major, expensive features, such as search, from scratch. A one-off feature that would cost $30,000 to build from scratch can be offered to customers at one-tenth the price. Duggal said the most reused building blocks were built by the top 1% of engineers on the company's network of developers.\n\n\"It's an assembly line for making software,\" he said. \"It's reusable building blocks, like car manufacturing, and a lot of automation.\"\n\nAs users navigate through Builder and pick out different features for their app, site, or other software, the site uses a neural network to come up with a price. Depending on how fast customers need the project and where they want it built, the software can be cheap or expensive.\n\nSee also: The 25 most valuable US startups that failed this year\n\nAnother aspect of Engineer.AI's service is \"BuilderCare,\" a kind of extended warranty for the software. It costs extra, a little like Apple's AppleCare for iPhones.\n\nAnd who is actually doing all the building?\n\nDuggal says Engineer.AI has 31,500 engineers on its network and almost 100 developer shops.\n\nAsked how the concept is different from asking freelancers on Upwork to code something cheaply, he said: \"We don't work with freelancers \u2014 we buy excess capacity from other developer shops. And there is a lot more control over the individual doing the work.\n\n\"Secondly, unlike something like Upwork, we don't rely on a user rating ... the bigger score is our AI that grades the [engineer's] code. We pick the developer that will work on [the software] on your behalf. And we guarantee quality and price.\"\n\nEngineer.AI plans to use the new funding to scale up.

The two cities will reportedly receive an as-yet-unknown portion of the 50,000 employees and $5 billion investment Amazon promised to winners of the project.\n\nWait, huh? That wasn't part of the plan.\n\nIf Amazon selects two cities for HQ2, as reported, then everything Amazon promised goes out the window. What makes this different from Amazon's presence in other cities where it has offices, such as Boston or Los Angeles?\n\nWill the company refer to both sites, which are hundreds of miles from each other, as HQ2? Or are we just supposed to think of HQ2 as the entire eastern seaboard \u2014 any city or town that is accessible from Amtrak's Acela service between New York and Washington, DC.\n\nIn fact, Amazon already has a sizable number of employees in both the DC area and New York City.

If it's separate, it's not equal.\n\nAmazon hyped up its HQ2 investment so much that cities were seemingly willing to do anything for the chance of landing it. Amazon probably at least figured that into its calculus, and when it realized it would be easier to count the cities that didn't jump at the chance to have Amazon in the backyard, the strategy shifted to just maximizing gains.\n\nWhile we don't yet know what tax incentives were offered for Amazon to select these two cities, nor what Amazon offered in return, we can safely assume it totaled in the billions.\n\nCity and state leaders jumped at the chance for what they saw as a high-profile win \u2014 and obvious benefit that constituents would see and appreciate.

Further, the group has allocated just 25% to bonds. That's below average and surprisingly low considering interest rates are climbing from historically low levels.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nIn other words, the madness that engulfed stocks in October wasn't enough to derail risk appetite for a large contingency of investors. And it's created a potentially dangerous situation for stocks heading into 2019.\n\nThat's because a lot of faith is being placed in a handful of stock-supportive forecasts. And not a lot of mind is being paid to the rapidly deteriorating conditions that led to the rocky October in the first place.\n\nThe aforementioned group's continued enthusiasm for holding stocks is most likely explained by a bullish outlook for 2019. Note that Goldman is forecasting a 5% return for the equity market.\n\nA lot has to transpire on an equity-demand basis, however, for stocks to continue on an upward trend next year. Goldman estimates that corporations will be \"by far\" the biggest driver, accounting for $700 billion in equity demand in 2019.\n\nThat's all well and good, but it gets decidedly more dicy when you consider that the outflows Goldman expects from pension funds ($100 billion), mutual funds ($125 billion), and households ($175 billion) will offset a significant portion of that corporate share demand.\n\nWhen you factor in that Goldman's bullish forecast also hinges on rosy demand forecasts for foreign investors (+$100 billion) and exchange-traded funds (+$300 billion), there's a lot that could go wrong \u2014 and a great deal of potential downside should anything surprise the market.\n\nIn the end, there's nothing in this equation that suggests an imminent reckoning in stocks. What it does show, however, is how precarious stock-market stability has gotten. Both profit growth and the tax cuts that have driven the most recent leg up have peaked. That's going to leave stocks without a valuable pair of allies as they navigate the rocky waters ahead.\n\nIf investors were more defensively positioned, they might be better equipped to withstand more bouts of instability.

The ideal scenario for a trader who buys at the low of a weekly decline is a subsequent rally.\n\nBut this outcome has not been the case in 2018. As this chart shows, based on these parameters, buying the dip has experienced its worst track record since the early 2000s.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nWilson is not forecasting that investors will no longer buy dips, nor is he recommending that they stop the practice. After all, buying stocks consistently without regard for their price is a smart way for long-term investors to lower their cost of trading over time \u2014 a practice referred to as dollar-cost averaging.\n\nHe is saying, however, that investors should henceforth brace for more volatility as stocks attempt to recover from their losses.\n\nWilson saw the October slump as a manifestation of the rolling-bear-market thesis he had espoused for more than a year prior. The rolling bear market is now morphing into a \"chopping\" bear market, he said, characterized by wilder swings and smaller rallies. Besides higher interest rates, investors are worrying about rising labor costs and how this might eat into corporate profits next year, and the shrinking balance sheets of the world's biggest central banks.\n\n\"For the rest of the year, we think US equity markets are likely to remain very choppy but in a narrower range,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"In terms of the S&P 500, we think the wider range of 2400-3000 we posited at the beginning of the year has likely narrowed to something like 2650-2800 \u2014 but with bigger intraday swings and hard-to-anticipate price action.\"", "Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIt appears likely that the US midterm elections will see the Democrats win the House and the Republicans maintain control of the Senate.\n\nA scenario in which the Republicans hold the presidency and the two chambers of Congress but give up the House in a midterm election has happened just twice: in 1910 and 1930.\n\nThe stock market sold off in the year following both of those elections \u2014 something it has done just four times in the past 27 midterms, according to Nautilus Investment Research.\n\nOne 2018 midterm election result that President Donald Trump probably hopes to avoid is also the one many analysts are saying is the most likely outcome: the Democrats taking control of the House while the Republicans hold the Senate.\n\nAs of Friday, Decision Desk HQ's Scott Tranter gave Democrats a 94.5% chance of winning the House and Republicans a 93.1% chance of keeping the Senate.\n\nSuch an occurrence has happened just twice in midterm election years when Republicans held the presidency and the two chambers of Congress, and in both cases it was terrible news for stocks.\n\n\"The only examples of a Republican President who controlled both the House and the Senate before the midterm elections, but lost control of the House, while maintaining control of the Senate, include only William Taft and Herbert Hoover,\" Nautilus Investment Research said in a note sent out to clients on Monday.\n\n\"Hopefully comparisons to 1930 end there, as Herbert Hoover is forever associated with the Great Depression and a horrific Bear Market.\"\n\nHoover oversaw a more-than-40% stock-market wipeout in the year following the 1930 midterm election, while the decline after Taft's 1910 midterm election was a more manageable 5.5%.\n\nWall Street says it's different this time\n\nBut Wall Street strategists aren't worried about a sell-off if the House flips blue this time around, as the change in Congress could help offset any damage caused by the trade war.\n\n\"The stock market tends to like gridlock better because it takes away the extremes and does not disrupt the status quo,\" John Lynch, the chief investment strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note.\n\nAnd a team at Deutsche Bank agreed.\n\n\"Our base case of the Democrats taking over the House holds the potential to reduce downside risks from trade policy friction,\" according to a team of Deutsche Bank strategists led by Parag Thatte.\n\n\"We see a variety of possible channels through which the administration's agenda on trade is likely to be curtailed by a switch in majority.

Crude exports contribute one-third of Iran's government revenues.\n\nTurkey depends heavily on imports to meet its energy needs and neighboring Iran has been one of its main sources of oil because of its proximity, crude quality and favorable price differentials, traders say.\n\nCavusoglu also said it was not that easy for countries including Turkey and Japan to diversify energy resources to comply with the sanctions.\n\n\"Not only neighboring countries but many countries from many regions of the world are being impacted by these unilateral sanctions.\"\n\n(Reporting by Ece Toksabay and Ali Kucukgocmen, Writing by Sarah Dadouch; Editing by Dominic Evans and John Stonestreet)", "A view shows the state flag of Russia before a meeting of Russian President Putin with French President Macron in St. Petersburg Thomson Reuters By Joseph Menn\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Russian actors believed to be connected to the government have been actively involved in spreading divisive content and promoting extreme themes in the run-up to Tuesday's U.S. mid-term elections, but they are working harder to hide their tracks, according to government investigators, academics and security firms.\n\nResearchers studying the spread of disinformation on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other platforms say the new, more subtle tactics have allowed most of the so-called information operations campaigns to survive purges by the big social media companies and avoid government scrutiny.\n\n\"The Russians are definitely not sitting this one out,\" said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. \"They have adapted over time to increased (U.S.) focus on influence operations.\"\n\nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies say Russia used disinformation and other tactics to support President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. The Russian government has rejected all allegations of election interference.\n\nOne clear sign of the continued Russian commitment to disrupting American political life came out in charges unsealed last month against a Russian woman who serves as an accountant at a St. Petersburg company known as the Internet Research Agency.\n\nAfter spending $12 million on a project to influence the U.S. election through social media in 2016, the company budgeted $12.2 million for last year and then proposed spending $10 million in just the first half of 2018, court filings showed.\n\nThe indictment said the Internet Research Agency used fake social media accounts to post on both sides of politically charged issues including race, gun control and immigration. The instructions were detailed, down to how to mock particular politicians during a specific news cycle.\n\nIf the goals of spreading divisive content have remained the same, the methods have evolved in multiple ways, researchers say. For one, there has been less reliance on pure fiction. People have been sensitized to look for completely false stories, and Facebook has been using outside fact-checkers to at least slow their spread on its pages.\n\n\"We've done a lot research on fake news and people are getting better at figuring out what it is, so it's become less effective as a tactic,\" said Priscilla Moriuchi, a former National Security Agency official who is now a threat analyst at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future threat manager.\n\nInstead, Russian accounts have been amplifying stories and internet \"memes\" that initially came from the U.S. far left or far right. Such postings seem more authentic, are harder to identify as foreign, and are easier to produce than made-up stories.\n\nRenee DiResta, director of research at security company New Knowledge, said her company had compiled a list of suspected Russian accounts on Facebook and Twitter that were similar to those suspended after the 2016 campaign.\n\nSome of them seized on the Brett Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court to rally conservatives, while others used memes from the leftist Occupy Democrats. Some operators of the accounts in the collection established themselves as far-right pundits and had accounts on Gab, the social network favored by the far right.\n\nBrookie said that while the Russian accounts might jump on a hot topic, the payoff would often come by throwing in related issues.\n\nBut that need not be necessary when the main topic is divisive enough. Take the idea of \"Blexit,\" a call for black Americans to exit the Democratic Party. The Daily Beast said it captured 250,000 tweets with the Blexit hashtag during a 15-hour burst last week and found that 40,000 of them came from handles that had previously participated in Russian information campaigns.\n\nThough jumping on existing bandwagons is easier than what Russia did in 2016, other new tactics have been more complex.\n\nIn the October indictment and an earlier operation uncovered by Facebook, records showed that the instigators used Facebook's Messenger service to try to get others to buy advertisements for them and to recruit American radicals to promote real-world protests.\n\nThose moves allowed the Russians to evade strengthened detection systems and blend in with the crowd.\n\n\"They are baiting Americans to drive more polarizing and vitriolic content,\" Brookie said. \"Any given solution needs to focus on basing our politics on facts, first and foremost, and to focus on what holds our country closer together.\"\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Menn in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Neil Fullick)", "Amazon is said to have selected two locations for its HQ2.

It took off thanks to China's over-abundance of young men.\n\nIn 2009, Alibaba founder Jack Ma seized on Singles' Day to deal with a lull in sales between October and Chinese New Year in late January.\n\nMa convinced around 30 merchants to lay on some discounts through the selling platform, Tmall. The event was an instant success.\n\nFive years later, 27,000 merchants were on board and merrily slashing prices.\n\nMa, using targeted marketing and China's economic shift to domestic consumption to appeal to the country to take a moment to buy stuff online, helped make Singles' Day what it is today.\n\nChina was encouraged to stay in and buy. And they did.\n\nFor the first time last year, Alibaba surpassed $25 billion in revenue.

Your Midterm Ad is a masterpiece personifying the insanity of our immigration Policy,\" David Duke, a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan leader, said of the ad. \"Bravo Trump!\"\n\nDemocrats slammed the ad as the latest example of Trump leveraging bigotry to motivate his base.\n\n\"No one [should] be surprised that the guy who fueled his rise to power on the birther movement is now deploying the next phase of white nationalism to fuel the election of his most loyal Republicans,\" Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former spokesman for Hillary Clinton, told Business Insider.\n\nNBC soon pulled the ad, and Fox News followed.\n\n\"After further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\" an NBC spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nBy midday on Monday, the major cable news networks and Facebook had all pulled the president's ad \u2014 a virtually unprecedented move. (Facebook continued to allow users to post the contents of the ad.)\n\nFox's decision to pull the spot \u2014 which it aired six times on Fox News and eight times on Fox Business, according to a media analyst \u2014 took many by surprise and reinforced the perception that the Trump campaign had gone too far.\n\n\"The President produced an ad that was so offensive that the cable network he openly promotes won't even air it. Where we are as a country,\" said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.\n\nEven Republicans who argued that the ad wouldn't much affect Tuesday's elections said they found its contents distasteful.\n\n\"I don't think it matters that much since it came so late,\" Matt Mackowiak, a GOP strategist based in Texas, told Business Insider of the ad's potential effect on voters. \"I wish the Trump campaign had been far more careful. They do not have to go overboard.

It has said it hopes to have at least part of the new campus operational sometime in 2019.\n\nThe saga of HQ2 began in September 2017, when the company put out its official request for proposals.\n\nIn the request Amazon promised 50,000 jobs and $5 billion in investment to the new host city. Nearly every major metro area in the US threw its hat in the ring.\n\nAmazon had whittled down the list to 20 by December but has barely made a peep about the selection process otherwise.\n\nThe Journal had reported last week that the e-commerce giant had decided to develop its second headquarters in two different cities, with 25,000 employees at each of the campuses.\n\nThe New York Times' report later seemingly confirmed that but added that the two selected areas were likely Long Island City and Crystal City. The Times report also confirmed that the deal was close to being finalized.\n\nRead more: Amazon is reportedly planning on crowning 2 HQ2 winners, with 2 new headquarters in separate locations\n\nSelecting two cities is something of a curveball because it was not originally part of the plan that Amazon had proposed for HQ2.\n\nAmazon declined to comment whether it had made a final decision.\n\nThe evidence had long been pointing toward the Washington, DC, metro area, which had submitted three separate regions for consideration. Amazon joined DC's chamber of commerce in August. Add to that the fact that Amazon has already had its public-policy and lobbying operations in the district, and the US capital seemed like a shoo-in.\n\nIn recent months, the betting odds had quite literally zeroed in on Northern Virginia. The region is in what has been referred to as the \"bull's-eye of America's internet,\" adding to its chances. A local news site, ARLnow.com, said it had seen an unusual spike in traffic from Amazon to an article from December titled \"County Wins Top Environmental Award from US Green Building Council,\" which explained how Virginia's Arlington County was the first in the US to be selected for an environmental award.\n\nThere had been less speculation about New York City, but New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently made his desire to host Amazon clear.\n\n\"I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,\" Cuomo told reporters on Monday. \"Because it would be a great economic boost.\"\n\nAccording to NY1, Cuomo reportedly met with Amazon executives in Seattle two weeks ago.\n\nOnce Amazon announces its selection, it will begin the more tedious job of working with local business leaders to integrate itself into the community.\n\nMore on Amazon's HQ2 project:", "San Francisco's biggest tech employer, Salesforce, is not mincing words when it comes to the city's homelessness crisis.\n\nThe cloud computing company, and its CEO Marc Benioff, have donated a combined $7.9 million to Proposition C, a ballot measure in San Francisco that would tax the city's largest corporations to help fix San Francisco's ongoing homelessness problem. Benioff has spent the past few weeks openly clashing with other San Francisco tech bigwigs, including Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, who is opposed to Prop C.\n\nBut one important voice in San Francisco's tech establishment has been silent in the fiery debate over Prop C. That would be Uber, the ride-hailing company that ranks as San Francisco's second largest tech employer and which is no stranger to controversy itself.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson confirmed with Business Insider on Monday that \"Uber remains neutral on Prop C with no plans to engage.\"\n\nUber is staying away from controversy\n\nThe decision not to take a side in San Francisco's most argued ballot measure may seem odd for such an important company in San Francisco. In addition to Uber's 5,000 full time San Francisco employees (that's excluding drivers), the company's gig-economy business model plays an important role in the individual welfare and livelihood of many San Francisco residents.\n\nOf course, after getting battered in a series of scandals in 2016 and 2017, including former CEO Travis Kalanick's presence on a Trump advisory board, Uber is trying to stay away from anything that carries any risk of controversy.\n\nOpposition to the corporate tax would have also put Uber in the same camp with companies like Visa, Stripe, and Square, as well as industry thought-leaders like Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham, Sequoia's Sir Michael Moritz, and Charles Schwab.\n\nAnd Uber's biggest competitor, Lyft, also opposed Prop C with a $100,000 donation.\n\nUber, however, is staying neutral on the tax that's opposed by San Francisco Mayor London Breed who argues that the city's homelessness crisis can't be solved by throwing money at it.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson did tell us that the company decided to donate $10,000 in support of Prop A, which would help retrofit and replace parts of the seawall that holds the San Francisco Bay waters back from flooding the city's downtown area.", "Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump's daughter and senior adviser, won initial approval for 16 Chinese trademarks despite the company shutting its doors in July, according to records released by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\nThe trademarks are the largest grouping approved in a single month for the brand since Trump's election, and raise questions surrounding continued conflicts of interest for one of Trump's senior advisers.\n\nThe applications for the trademarks, which pertain to everything from bags to umbrellas to sausages, were filed in May 2016, but were notably not withdrawn when Ivanka's business was shuttered.\n\nIn July, Ivanka closed down her business, saying \"my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington.\"\n\n\"I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business,\" she said.\n\nBut according to an unnamed source from a July report in The Washington Post, the president's daughter planned to continue to seek trademarks, even after her company shut down.\n\nShut down, but not shut out\n\nIvanka's brand received intense scrutiny after Trump's election. Her products were almost exclusively made overseas despite her and her fathers championing of local labor, and the brand was dropped from retailers like Marshall's, Nordstrom, and TJ Maxx. Those developments were prompted in part by public animus toward her father. By June 2018, sales had dropped nearly 45%, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\n\nIn May, Ivanka's brand received approval for seven trademarks. The same month, Trump announced that he had reached a deal with China to lift the US ban on telecom giant ZTE. The timing of that news raised some eyebrows as well.\n\nNoah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told Business Insider in May that \"It raises significant questions about corruption, as it invites the possibility that she could be benefiting financially from her position and her father's presidency or that she could be influenced in her policy work by countries' treatment of her business.\"\n\nWhen Ivanka announced her brand's closure in July, it was speculated that certain ethics conundrums stemming from the business would be sealed.\n\nBut according to Caroline Zhang, social media manager at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, these new approvals revive previous concerns of conflicts of interest: \"Since she has retained her foreign trademarks, the public will continue to have to ask whether Trump has made foreign policy decisions in the interest of his and his family's businesses.\"\n\nPreviously, officials from Ivanka's company have claimed that her international trademarks were measures to prevent foreign entities from capitalizing on her name.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Peter Mirijanian, spokesperson for Ivanka's ethics attorney Abbe Lowell, took a similar stance: \"These trademarks were sought to broadly protect Ms. Trump's name, and to prevent others from stealing her name and using it to sell their products. This is a common trademark practice, which is why the trademark applications were granted.\"\n\nWhether or not Ivanka's plans go beyond simple protection isn't yet clear.\n\nThis post was updated at 12:16 PM on November 6, 2018 with a statement from Ivanka Trump's attorney.", "JPMorgan Chase announced Monday that starting January it will begin a five-year, $30 million dollar investment in Seine-Saint-Denis, a region of France to the northeast of Paris. It's an area marked by high unemployment, crime, and homelessness, and has 28% of its population living below the poverty line.\n\nIt also, however, is on the cusp of two developments that JPMorgan wants to take advantage of: the 2024 Olympics \u2014 Seine-Saint-Denis is home to France's national soccer and rugby stadium \u2014 and the Grand Paris Express rapid transit line that will connect Greater Paris\n\nAs Stephanie Mestrallet, JPMorgan's vice president of global philanthropy in Europe, told Business Insider, \"OK, we know that there are these issues, we know that a lot of people are going to invest in these areas \u2014 can we add to this effort that is currently happening?\"\n\nThe money will go toward apprenticeship programs for young people, job retraining programs for older adults, and small business development.\n\nThe investment is a continuation of JPMorgan's philanthropic commitment to the region and will be the first made from the $500 million AdvancingCities initiative when it begins in January. AdvancingCities is itself a five-year program that the bank developed as an extension of investments into Detroit in 2013, after CEO Jamie Dimon decided to assist the city after it declared bankruptcy.\n\nThe bank found its Detroit project so successful that it made similar investments in Chicago, Washington, DC, and the New York City borough of the Bronx. Advancing Cities is built upon the lessons learned in these American cities over the last five years.\n\nThe initiative has two components, involving a competition among cities around the world that want help with kickstarting their economies, as well as investments outside of the contest. Seine-Saint-Denis falls into the latter, and Peter Scher, JPMorgan's head of corporate responsibility, said that the 150-year anniversary of JPMorgan's involvement in France (when JPMorgan's business partner opened a firm there) this November was a great occasion to move forward with a project they deemed ready to go.\n\nJPMorgan had sent 16 employees to the area this past spring to get familiar with the area and see if there were necessary conditions for successful investments. They decided there indeed were. And though the AdvancingCities competition is still fielding proposals from more than 1,000 cities for the rest of the month, Scher said, \"When we feel like we're ready and we can make the investments we do.\"\n\nUsing lessons from Detroit and London\n\nWhen Scher explained AdvancingCities to us in September, he said that one of the key takeaways from their initial work in Detroit was that the level of partnerships on the ground is contingent on the success of the investments. That is, the bank's team has to rely on business and government leaders in each respective region to determine where money will be best spent and loaned.\n\nIn Seine-Saint-Denis, the French President Emmanuel Macron's administration is involved in the project, and the minister of employment, Muriel Penicaud, will join Dimon on Tuesday in an announcement press conference at the Les Compagnons du Devoir (LCD) charity in the region. JPMorgan partnered with the charity last fall and made a 460,000-euro investment into apprenticeship programs.\n\nThe AdvancingCities initiative as a whole utilizes both low-cost loans and philanthropic spending, but this upcoming $30 million investment will be entirely in the form of grants. They will support more apprenticeship programs like those offered by LCD, as well as small business accelerators like Impact Partenaire and Pact PME.\n\nScher said the JPMorgan will send around 100 employees from its global offices to assist with these programs over the next five years, as it has done with its previous city investments.\n\nHe said that the Great Paris initiative's success will be measured by effects on employment rates and small business growth, particularly in the poorest sections of the region. The AdvancingCities team is using its insights from its American projects, as well as how the bank's investments in East London during the 2012 London Summer Olympics affected the city's economy, for Seine-Saint-Denis' benefit.\n\n\"I think it demonstrates that not just the challenges are quite similar wherever you go, but many of the solutions are quite similar,\" Scher said.", "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to end a program introduced by former President Barack Obama that protects thousands of young immigrants who live in the United States without legal status.\n\nThe day before congressional elections in which Trump's harsh anti-immigration rhetoric has taken center stage, the administration urged the justices to throw out three lower court rulings that blocked Trump's plan to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nThe policy has shielded from deportation immigrants dubbed \"Dreamers\" and given them work permits, though not a path to citizenship.\n\nIn a court filing, Solicitor General Noel Francisco said the original DACA policy was introduced by Obama administration officials \"even though existing laws provided them no ability to do so.\" Now, it is lawful for the Department of Homeland Security to change course, he added.\n\n\"It is plainly within DHS's authority to set the nation's immigration enforcement priorities and to end the discretionary DACA policy,\" Francisco said.\n\nThe Justice Department's move was unusually aggressive in terms of procedure, asking the justices to take action even before intermediate federal appeals courts have ruled on the three lower court rulings. The administration says a final ruling is urgently needed.\n\nIf the Supreme Court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority, agrees to hear the case, a ruling would likely come before the end of June.\n\nTrump and his conservative political allies have made his hard-line policies toward immigration a key issue ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections that will determine if his fellow Republicans maintain control of Congress.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that Obama exceeded his constitutional powers when he bypassed Congress and created DACA, which offers protections to roughly 700,000 young adults, mostly Hispanics.\n\nThe administration is contesting three different district court rulings from judges in California, New York and the District of Columbia that told the administration to continue processing renewals of existing DACA applications while litigation over the legality of Trump's action is resolved.", "Early voting numbers suggest that Tuesday's elections will have one of the highest voter turnouts for a midterm election in recent years.\n\nBut while it's good that Americans are exercising their civic duty, it makes predicting the outcome of the election almost impossible, according to \"Meet the Press\" host Chuck Todd.\n\nTodd appeared on the \"Today\" show on Monday to discuss the midterms, which Democrats are hoping will win them back control of the House, and possibly the Senate.\n\nRead more: These 25 Congressional races to watch are some of the most competitive in the 2018 midterm elections\n\nTodd says he expects the vote to cross the 100 million mark, and that the numbers he's seeing so far are more like the engagement one would see for a presidential election, which are far more popular.\n\n\"When you have a turnout like this, it's gonna make pollsters look ridiculous, not because they don't do a good job, but because you can not accommodate for all these new voters in any sort of model,\" Todd said.\n\nPollsters ran into a similar issue during the last election, when a wave of voters turned out to vote for Trump. Almost every poll at the time predicted Hillary Clinton winning the race.", "As election day approaches, the gloves are coming off for some Silicon Valley execs over the controversial Proposition C, a ballot measure in San Francisco that would tax the city's largest corporations to provide relief in the city's ongoing homelessness crisis.\n\nThe latest bout came Saturday between Zynga chairman and co-founder Mark Pincus and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff \u2014 the latter of whom had previously taken Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to task for his opposition to Prop C.\n\nOver the past two months, Benioff has become the undisputed top evangelist in support of Prop C, with him and his company donating a combined $7.9 million to the cause. That's put him at odds with figures including San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who vocally opposes Proposition C, though prominent politicians including Nancy Pelosi and Diane Feinstein agree with him.\n\nPincus, who according to public records has not donated to either side of the measure, tweeted on Saturday, calling Prop C, \"the dumbest, least thought out prop ever.\" He questioned how much taxes would increase for Salesforce and Zynga should the proposition pass muster with voters, and said the proposed measure \"doesnt connect the problem to the money in a logical way.\"\n\nBenioff said the homelessness issue in San Francisco was urgent and that,\"we can not wait any longer for a 'better' or 'more fair' plan.\"\n\nHere's how the conversation went down.\n\nPincus' tweet set things off.\n\nLater that night, Benioff responded, setting off a short social media donnybrook.\n\nSome back-of-the-envelope math ensued to better understand how much Salesforce would be paying in taxes under Proposition C \u2014 Benioff said it would range between $10-$11 million per year.\n\nPincus shot back that it didn't matter how much Zynga would pay \u2014 he stood by Mayor Breed's position that it wouldn't help, no matter how much was raised by the measure.\n\nThe two execs went back and forth: Pincus agreed with Benioff that business gives a new platform to effect change, but like many in opposition to Prop C, he believes there needs to be a better plan in place to fight homelessness in San Francisco.\n\nThey eventually reached some kind of impasse. At 10:25 PT, Benioff walked away, revealing his Bitmoji to the world as he slammed the door on Pincus.\n\nRead more: San Francisco's tech billionaires are fighting over how to deal with the city's homelessness crisis \u2014 Here's what each tech bigwig says about Tuesday's vote on Prop C\n\nWhile Benioff's own support for Proposition C is often credited to a direct message conversation with a San Francisco bookstore owner back in September convinced him to back the measure fully, the man himself says it started with a report from the San Francisco city controller's office \u2014 though the conversation helped. Either way, Benioff has thrown all of his might behind the Prop C fight, urging fellow executives to back the measure.\n\nIf passed, Prop C would bring in an additional $250 to $300 million annually to help fight homelessness in San Francisco. Mayor Breed and other critics say that the city's homelessness crisis can't be solved by throwing money at it, and that it could make things worse.", "Electric scooter company Bird has taken a step towards entering the UK market by launching within the confines of London's Olympic Park.\n\nWhile the buzzy US startup can't fully launch in Britiain because of laws that prevent scooters from being used on roads or pavements, Bird has found a way to get off the ground.\n\nFrom Tuesday, Bird will make its scooters available along a route in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London. It follows talks with \"multiple private landowners,\" according to Bird UK Head Richard Corbett.\n\nThe Olympic Park was selected because its owners, the London Legacy Development Corporation, have toyed with new tech ventures in the past (such as a driverless bus), and because Bird was keen to solve what it views as a \"mobility issue.\"\n\nAt one end of the Olympic Park sits a business campus which houses multiple companies, plus two university campuses, to which Bird aims to provide faster access.

It never attained the mainstream success of its Pok\u00e9mon-flavored successor, but Ingress had, and continues to have, legions of dedicated players all around the globe. For a taste, here's my friend Laura Michet's account of her experience falling down the Ingress rabbit hole circa 2014. Even now, Niantic hosts Ingress events, called Anomolies, that draw players from all over the world.\n\n\"Everything that we put into Pokemon Go, everything we're putting into [Niantic's forthcoming Harry Potter: Wizards Unite], came from insights we got from Ingress,\" Niantic CEO John Hanke said in a meeting with reporters last week.\n\nNow, Ingress is back, baby, with Ingress Prime, a revamped and relaunched version of the game with new graphics, new sound effects, a new storyline, and various and sundry other improvements. It's functionally the same game as before, but revitalized to bring it up to modern standards. Indeed, if you already have Ingress installed, Ingress Prime comes as a normal app update to the base game.\n\nHere's the trailer:\n\nNiantic was nice enough to hook me up with early access to Ingress Prime, before it started rolling out to players on Monday. In truth, I haven't had much time to play: My home is in kind of a dead zone for Niantic's brand of real-world location tracking, which made it tricky to play over the weekend.\n\nRead more: The creator of Pok\u00e9mon Go bought an LA-based gaming studio as its acquisition spree continues\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that Ingress Prime is way more intense than Pok\u00e9mon Go \u2014 and it could be the perfect challenge for any Pok\u00e9mon player who's already \"caught them all.\"\n\nHow Ingress works\n\nEven the interface can be a little overwhelming. But don't be scared: It's very similar to Pok\u00e9mon Go. The green flares here are Portals controlled by the Enlightened, the game's green team. The green lines are links between their portals. You can even see a piece of a green triangle \u2014 a \"field\" claimed by the Enlightened. Screenshot/Business Insider The basic components of Ingress should be familiar to any \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\" player. You walk around the real world, finding points of interest \u2014 public art, historical landmarks, or other notable sites \u2014 and claiming them for your team. The two games are built on the same database of interesting locations, so there's a ton of overlap.\n\nBut where Pok\u00e9mon Go has Pok\u00e9stops and Pok\u00e9mon gyms, Ingress has Portals. Same idea, but...this is where it gets complicated.\n\nWhenever you're near a Portal, you can hack it to gain resources, like Resonators and XMP Bursters. Resonators help you claim a Portal for your team, while XMP Bursters are your main weapon for taking down those guarded by the opposition.\n\nStill with me? Okay, so: You can link two or more Portals together, strengthening them and making them harder to take down. But for the link to work, there can't be any Portals claimed by the enemy in the way. This means that linking is easy at short distances, but harder over long range.\n\nBut if your team manages to make a triangle by linking three Portals, it gets to claim the entire area for its own, thusly winning major points over the other team, in a process called \"fielding.\" This means that Ingress players \u2014 who, by the way, take it incredibly seriously \u2014 get into real turf wars, trying to claim entire cities, counties, and sometimes states for their own.\n\nEven the story is complicated. It involves a clash between the two teams: The Enlightened, who want to use the power of the Portals to benefit mankind, and the Resistance, who want to close the Portals to protect humanity. As part of the Ingress Prime relaunch, the story, too, has gotten something of a reboot. A new web series from Niantic introduces the major characters, while an Ingress anime will soon come to Netflix, featuring new music by Alt-J.\n\nThe story can be affected by player choice. Those Anomoly events come with their own story developments, and however each team performs, that has some kind of bearing on what happens next in the struggle between the Resistance and the Enlightened.\n\nIt's kind of a lot. As an Ingress newbie, it's all kind of overwhelming. But as an active Pok\u00e9mon Go player since day one, I do have to admit, I'm intrigued by the apparent depth of Ingress Prime's story, and its more competitive aspects.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nIn the grand scheme, the launch of Ingress Prime comes at a pivotal moment for Niantic.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go may no longer be the global phenomenon it once was, but it's still a very popular smartphone game in its own right. And there's no reason to believe that Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, the next big Niantic game due out later this year, won't be popular, too.\n\nAt the same time, though, Niantic is trying to reposition itself, not as a gaming company, but as the creator of tools and software to build augmented reality games and apps powered by the technology pioneered in its hit titles. Niantic has promised to detail more of its plans in that regard later this year. The world according to Ingress, at the time of writing.

The update, which Mixer is calling \"Season 2,\" is focused on promoting more ways to interact on the platform and more ways for streamers to get revenue.\n\nLivestreaming has had an undeniable impact on the way that people, and video game fans specifically, interact with their entertainment and build community. By engaging directly with their audience, popular streamers have been able to establish their own communities on platforms like Mixer, Twitch, and YouTube, without constantly relying on specific games. But to be successful, rather than just popular, streamers have to find ways to monetize their audience.\n\nRead more:Twitch raises incentives for creators\n\nVideo game streamers are primarily dependent on monthly subscribers and donations for revenue, due to inconsistent returns from advertisements during their broadcasts. In April 2017, Twitch, the most popular livestreaming platform for video games, introduced a virtual currency called Bits, giving players an official way to donate to multiple streams in smaller increments. Every Bit donated is equal to one cent earned for the streamer; Twitch charges $7 for 500 Bits, meaning they earn roughly $2 for every $5 donated to different streamers in Bits.\n\nTwitch users can buy bits to support their favorite streams. Twitch\n\nOnly Twitch partners and affiliates, streamers with a proven track record, are eligible to receive income from subscriptions and bit donations. On YouTube, any creator with a Google AdSense account can be eligible for ad revenue, and some gaming channels now have access to a subscription option. Mixer Season 2 is offering streamers a more direct path to monetization with a more elaborate currency system and better incentives for viewers who want to support the creators.\n\nHere's how Mixer's 2 currencies will work\n\nWith the launch of Season 2, Mixer plans to use two separate virtual currencies that allow viewers to support their favorite streams in different ways. Users on Mixer can passively earn one currency, called \"Sparks\", by watching streams or streaming themselves. Sparks can be spent to trigger special chat interactions, called skills, which include animated stickers, GIFs, simple games, and other effects that appear over the Mixer stream overlay. The effects are considerably more involved and intentionally more interactive than the emotes offered by Twitch.\n\nThe skill tray, pictured above, lets viewers spend sparks for different stickers and effects. Mixer\n\nSpending sparks while watching will help boost the creator's channel, and streamers become eligible for a payout after reaching certain spark milestones. The second currency, Mixer \"Embers\", has not been released yet, but will only be available for cash purchase. Embers will be able to trigger exclusive skills and can be used to tip streamers directly.\n\nStreamers get clear financial rewards when viewers use their sparks on the channel. Mixer\n\nWhether it's Sparks, Embers or Bits, the point of the currency is to encourage viewers to support what they're watching. As season 2 continues Mixer plans to provide added incentive for spending sparks with a progression system for viewers. Spending more sparks with the same streamer will give the viewer access to more unique skills and channel-specific perks.\n\nBehind the scenes, Mixer will also be implementing automatic bitrate switching for a smoother viewing experience from mobile devices or less stable internet connections. Creators will also have greater control over their stream feed with the implementation of the RTMP standard used by Twitch and YouTube and the adoption of Mixer's FTL streaming protocol on more devices.\n\nThe Mixer development team plans to release Embers and the viewer progression system in the coming weeks while solidifying the other Season 2 improvements. Sparks and skill abilities are already live on the platform and creators are able to use their new tools to set clear goals for their stream.

According to Westgate Las Vegas Superbook, there is a greater than 50 percent chance that the 2019 NCAA Championship winner will be one of the four teams playing at Bankers Life Fieldhouse Tuesday night.\n\nSo without further ado, here's everything you need to know about the each of these matchups:\n\nNo. 1 Kansas vs. No. 10 Michigan State (7:00 PM ET on ESPN):\n\nHead coach Tom Izzo's Spartans have taken down the Jayhawks in each of their past two meetings at the Champions Classic, including a 67-64 thriller in 2012 and Denzel Valentine's astounding triple-double performance three years later.\n\nBut this could very well be the end of Michigan State's reign in this head-to-head matchup because Kansas is stacked with talent this season. In addition to returning two of their top-five scorers, the Jayhawks brought in three top-30 recruits and a heralded transfer class featuring former Cal point guard Charlie Moore and Memphis stars Dedric and K.J. Lawson. Dedric Lawson was named to the AP preseason All-America team after averaging 19.2 points, 9.9 rebounds, 2.1 blocks for the Tigers during the 2016-17 season.\n\nOn the other side of the court, Izzo returns three of his top four scorers despite losing both Miles Bridges and Jaren Jackson to the NBA. Point guard Cassius Winston was selected to this year's Bob Cousy Award watch list after leading the Big Ten with 6.9 assists per game last season and shooting 50.7 percent from the field and 49.7 percent from beyond the arc. Center Nick Ward could very well average a double-double in his junior year, while Joshua Langford \u2014 a former five-star recruit \u2014 is due for a breakout season after two relatively quiet years in East Lansing. Kansas head coach Bill Self will be tasked with forging team chemistry between his ragtag group of stars to keep up with this veteran-laden Spartan squad.\n\nNo. 2 Kentucky vs. No. 4 Duke (9:30 PM ET on ESPN):\n\nThe first time they faced off in the Champions Classic, Duke defeated Kentucky 75-68, but that Wildcat squad didn't even make the NCAA Tournament at the end of the year. Three years later, Kentucky took down a young Blue Devil squad mere months after they won the 2015 national championship. Now, the kings of the one-and-done era face off with the tournament's all-time record \u2014 and bragging rights \u2014 on the line.\n\nHead coach Mike Krzyzewski boasts the nation's best recruiting class of the year \u2014 and maybe ever \u2014 after reigning in the top-three prospects plus two more top-50 recruits. Social media sensation Zion Williamson may be the most recognizable name on the floor, but expect AP preseason All-America selection R.J. Barrett to be the difference-maker for the Blue Devils Tuesday night. The Canadian small forward has a history of vexing Kentucky head coach John Calipari. He posted 38 points, 13 rebounds, and 5 assists in the semifinals of the 2017 FIBA U19 World Cup to take down the two-time reigning champion United States team with Calipari at the helm. But now they're playing at the college level, and Coach Cal's Wildcats have experience on their side. Experienced sophomores P.J. Washington, Quade Green, and Nick Richards are joined by battle-tested Stanford graduate transfer Reid Travis and four five-star recruits.\n\nDuke, meanwhile, doesn't return a single starter from last season. Junior captain Javin DeLaurier and 2016 McDonald's All-American Marques Bolden both figure to play a much bigger role for the Blue Devils this year, but it will indubitably take time for their young teammates to get comfortable playing together at a much higher level than they are used to.", "\"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" is getting a rather surprising crossover with the NFL: Kersey outfits for all 32 NFL teams \u2014 and a special \"Fortnite\" team, too \u2014 will be added to the game on November 9th.\n\nBoth male and female characters will be able to select the outfit from the team of their choosing, with a number between 1 and 99.

Amazon is gaining steam in the industry, and its growth threatens to crimp Roku's own, they said.\n\n\"Amazon is directly in competition with Roku,\" Swinburne and Nowak said in the report. They continued: \"Amazon has seen meaningful share gains ... and is likely catching up to Roku.\"\n\nThat's likely to strike some fear into the hearts of investors and possibly Roku's management. Amazon, after all, is a notoriously cutthroat competitor, especially in its core retail business, where it's already helped kill off a slew of formerly prominent rivals.\n\nSwinburne, who covers Roku for Morgan Stanley, is concerned enough about the threat from Amazon and other companies that he has an \"equal weight\" rating \u2014 essentially a \"hold\" \u2014 on Roku's stock and a target price of $50, which is nearly $7 a share below where it's currently trading.\n\nAmazon and Roku are increasingly butting heads\n\nAnthony Wood, the CEO of Roku, which is increasingly dependent on advertising rather than device sales. Roku In looking at Amazon's budding rivalry with Roku, Swinburne and Nowak take a broad view of the streaming-television market.\n\nIt includes digital-media players such as Roku's Ultra; software platforms such as Amazon's Fire OS that underlie those devices and certain smart TVs and distribute apps and channels to them; and video services such as the Roku channel that are distributed over those devices and others.\n\nCompanies in the market generate revenue by selling devices, licensing their operating systems to other manufacturers, offering subscriptions to their video services or those they distribute, and selling advertising on the video channels they own or distribute.\n\nBoth Roku and Amazon compete in the three major portions of the streaming video market, as do Apple, Comcast, Google, and others. But in the device area, Roku and Amazon are increasingly the dominant players, according to Morgan Stanley's research. While Roku's first-place share has stayed steady, Amazon has steadily grabbed share from Google and smaller players.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nThe platform battle is more of a mixed bag. But Roku has established itself as a leading player in smart TVs, primarily by licensing its software to TCL, which has become one of the leading brands in North America.\n\nAmazon has been setting itself up as the primary alternative to Roku, at least among manufacturers that don't have their own television operating system and app store. Earlier this year, Amazon signed a deal to have its Fire TV software installed on Insignia TVs, the house brand at Best Buy.\n\nAdvertising has become key to Roku's business\n\nBut the biggest area of competition could be in the content area.\n\nThe fastest-growing part of Roku's business of late has been in advertising sales. The company sells advertisements on the main screens of the user interface of its software platform, but also sells video ads that run on its Roku Channel and on some of the channels it offers in its app store.\n\nRead this: A gold mine is buried 'under the weeds' at Amazon \u2014 here's why it could take the company beyond the $1 trillion mark\n\nRoku has been so successful selling ads, that its \"platform\" business segment \u2014 which largely consists of advertising sales \u2014 is now bringing in more revenue than sales of its devices.\n\nBut there again, Roku could face some stiff competition from Amazon. Like Roku, Amazon has become a distributor of streaming channels. Like Roku, advertising happens to be the fastest-growing piece of its business. And it reportedly has in the works an ad-supported channel that would be built around its IMDB service that would be essentially Amazon's version of the Roku Channel.\n\nThe as with any advertising-based business, Roku's has grown by offering marketers a large and growing audience and persuading that audience to spend more time with its services. The danger with for Roku is that rivals, particularly Amazon, might slow the growth of its advertising business, whether by stealing market share from its devices and software or by diverting the attention of Roku users to alternate video services.\n\n\"Competition by the likes of Amazon and others is real and intensifying,\" Swinburne and Nowak said in the report.\n\nRoku's shares closed regular trading on Monday off $1.04, or about 2%, to $56.85. Amazon's ended the day down $37.73, or 2%, to $1,627.80.\n\nNow read:", "Trident Juncture, taking place between October 25 and November 7 in and around Norway, is just one of NATO's military exercises this year.\n\nBut officials have said the 50,000 troops, tens of thousands of vehicles, and dozens of planes and ships on hand make it the biggest NATO exercise since the Cold War.\n\nNATO leaders have stressed it's strictly a defensive exercise, but it comes amid heightened tensions between NATO and Russia, and Moscow has made its displeasure well known.\n\nWhat's also clear is that as the US and NATO refocus on operations in Europe, they're preparing to deal with a foe that predates the alliance and the rival it was set up to counter.\n\nGerman infantrymen board a MV-22B Osprey during Trident Juncture 18 at Vaernes Air Base, Norway, November 1, 2018.

Usually, recent and often-used apps stay open and running in the background for convenient quick access when you return to the app.\n\nInstead, some Pixel 3 users have found that their recently-used apps need to fully re-open when they return to them. Other users have found that Spotify, in particular, will randomly close itself when other apps are in use.\n\nHaving to re-open apps can take significantly longer than returning to the app when it's running in the background. It's a minor nuisance, perhaps more so for games that need to reload entirely, which can take more time than standard apps.\n\nBut users aren't happy that a brand-new smartphone with a pretty high price tag \u2014 $800 for the Pixel 3 and $900 for the Pixel 3 XL \u2014 has problems retaining apps in the background. Many say it hasn't been an issue on previous devices.\n\nMost are pointing the finger at the Pixel 3 phones' comparatively paltry 4GB of RAM. Indeed, that's on the lower end for top Android smartphones these days, where 6GB of RAM is more or less the standard now. Marques Brownlee of the MKBHD YouTube channel also expressed his concern about the Pixel 3's minimal RAM.\n\nA quick refresher on RAM: It's short-term memory where any device like a phone or computer can store the apps you've recently used so that you can revisit those recently-used apps right where you left off, without needing to re-open the app. The more RAM you have, the more apps can be stored, and the faster you can switch between them.\n\nGoogle told Android Police it's a glitch and it can be patched up with a software update. Let's hope so because it would be a hardware issue otherwise, where the only fix is to buy a new smartphone with more RAM. I personally haven't experienced issues with multi-tasking on the Pixel 3 XL I've recently used.

According to my patients, my podcast guests, and the 50 people I interviewed for my forthcoming book on the topic, far too many people \u2014 romantic partners, friends, family members \u2014 are engaging in bruising political arguments that accomplish nothing except irreparably harming their relationships.\n\nA man familiar with my work wrote me that his sister-in-law had called off her engagement over a difference of opinion with her fianc\u00e9 about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's Senate hearing, and another man emailed me that he and his brother had unfriended each other on Facebook for the same reason.\n\nBut regardless of the wreckage we are seeing, often abetted by the partisan media and the internet, there is hope!\n\nTake my relationship, for example. I'm a committed liberal psychotherapist and author. My husband, Rick Brookhiser, is a senior editor of the \"National Review,\" the leading journal of conservative opinion. We agree about almost nothing political, yet he and I have managed to remain civil for almost 40 years.\n\nHow did we accomplish this astonishing feat?\n\nWe've learned how to talk about politics, and what not to talk about \u2014 and we agree about almost everything else.\n\nIn the run-up to the midterm elections, political arguments have become even more acrid, and we desperately need help communicating with the many people in our lives who are on the other side. I've created a podcast called \"I Love You But I HATE Your Politics,\" where I interviewed 50 people in bipartisan couples of all sorts, and I showcase those who have figured out how to communicate about hot-button issues without mutually assured destruction, so that listeners can be inspired to try these techniques themselves. In the most recent episode \u2014 coming soon! \u2014 I interviewed my husband.\n\nBelow are some recommendations culled from what my guests have learned, from my own experience as a psychotherapist, and what I know from my own marriage. Here's how to cultivate civility in political disputes.\n\n1. Do not raise your voice\n\nYour opponent will likely interpret even a slight increase in volume as shouting, and will stop listening as a result. Rational discussion will then become impossible.\n\nWhen discussing politics with my husband, if I think before I speak, and make sure I'm not communicating in a tone that could be construed as contempt, dismissal, or outrage \u2014 which a raised voice does \u2014 he is more receptive and less defensive. Using this tactic, we were able to have a conversation about Roe v. Wade \u2014 my premier hot-button issue, which he believes should be overturned \u2014 that was civil and thoughtful. This hadn't been possible years ago, before I understood that the tone and volume in which I expressed myself is more important than what I actually said.\n\nRaising your voice won't get you anywhere in a one-on-one conversation. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\n2. Friends don't let friends drink and discuss politics\n\nIt's hard enough to react well in difficult conversations when you're stone-cold sober, let alone when you've had a few drinks.\n\nTwo interview subjects of mine, a gay couple who are both supporters of President Donald Trump, were in the habit of getting into political arguments about Trump's character after they had quite a few drinks. This inevitably led to yelling (see tactic number one, above), slammed doors, and, on one occasion, a smashed cell phone. Shortly thereafter they agreed to never mix alcohol and politics.\n\n3. Never send an unsolicited partisan article from your side of a contentious issue to your mate, relative, or friend\n\nThrusting an unsolicited article on someone is an automatic turn-off, and will not get your point across.\n\nThe way to share partisan articles with your friend or partner is doing it like two of my podcast guests, Harry and Allan, did. Allan wrote a note to Harry, saying, \"Harry, if I gave you an article expressing my viewpoint on something, would you read it? Of course, I'll read something you send me as well.\"\n\nAnd he only did it once.\n\n4. If the two of you can't talk about a political issue, simply don't talk about it\n\nThere are lots of people on your side that you can talk to instead of the person with whom you can't have a civil conversation about the issue.\n\nMake avoidance of destructive controversy a joint decision, and don't violate the contract. Part of maturity is recognizing that there are some issues that cannot be discussed without misery ensuing.\n\nThis isn't just true about politics, it applies to other issues, as well \u2014 your partner's mother, for example. You can still be true to your beliefs without foisting them on an unwilling audience.\n\nThere are plenty of other people who agree with you and who would be eager to discuss the very things that are taboo in your intimate relationship.\n\nBrynn Anderson/AP\n\n5. Do not start any political conversation with, 'How can your side possibly think...?'\n\nThis is not a conversation-starter. It's an indictment. You automatically turn off the other person by signalling that you abhor his or her stance, and you won't have a rational or amicable discussion after delivering an insult.\n\n6. Do not read your politically-divergent partner's political posts on social media\n\nYou probably already know what you'll find, and it will come back to haunt you.\n\nConsider doing this as much of a taboo as reading the other person's diary, even though online comments are public. People are pathologically uninhibited online. They tend to be more restrained and more receptive when they talk directly \u2014 so do that instead.\n\nJacqueline Larma/AP\n\n7. Never conduct a political argument via email or text\n\nIt may seem more convenient, but texts and email are easy to misinterpret, and offensively impersonal. If you really want to talk about something, call or arrange to meet in person.\n\n8. This is the hardest and most important principle of all: Stop trying to change the other person's mind, no matter how compelling it is to try\n\nIt is a universal fantasy that we can change other people, especially the ones we love. Thinking you can is a refusal to accept the limits of your influence over others. Giving up your desire to change someone \u2014 whether you're trying to make an unresponsive person love you, or a politically-opposed person agree with you \u2014 might be difficult, but once you do, you will improve the quality of your communication.\n\nConstant attempts to convert your opponent will likely only make your fights worse.\n\nUsing these same guidelines, my husband and I have found a way to talk about politics, and I've learned a great deal about how people outside my own perspective think and feel. This has been especially delightful during the Trump administration, because it is the first time we actually agree about a president: We both abhor his character.\n\nMost of the time, though, we prefer to talk about topics other than politics, things that seem more fundamental and more fruitful to our relationship, like the books we're writing and reading, our many shared interests in music and the arts, human nature, and psychology.\n\nSo now is an excellent time to strike a blow for civility in your home or office, and good practice for 2020.

This poll, the largest of its kind, shows that as Brexit unravels and the benefits of EU membership become clearer, the appetite for Remain grows.\n\n\"But there is only one way to test the scale of this change and that is through a People's Vote.\"\n\nBrake's Lib Dem colleague, Layla Moran MP, said the findings showed \"unequivocally that the momentum behind a People's Vote is now at breaking point\" as negotiators try to make a breakthrough in Brexit talks.\n\n\"Theresa May needs to take responsibility for her botched Brexit. We need to give the People, who are clearly changing their minds, the final say,\" Moran told BI.\n\nMay has consistently ruled out holding another referendum, while the position of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is to consider backing another referendum if a general election in early 2019 isn't possible.\n\nNegotiators hope to finalise a deal by December at the latest with the UK's March departure just five months away.\n\nThe Survation research suggests that most people would be willing to compromise in Brexit talks the EU.\n\nFor example, a majority back a liberal UK-EU immigration policy after Brexit, in which EU and UK citizens would be able to live and work in each other's countries (76%). They'd also support a deal in which the UK would follow EU rules on certain goods (62%), meaning the UK would stay close to aspects of the single market.\n\nHowever, a large majority of respondents want the UK to have an independent trade policy after Brexit (75%).", "As the competition for Amazon's second headquarters heats up, cities and states are getting increasingly desperate to win over the e-commerce giant.\n\n\"I'll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that's what it takes,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters at an event on Monday, referring to his determination to land Amazon's second headquarters.\n\nHours later, on Monday evening, The New York Times reported that Amazon is nearing a deal to move HQ2 to the Long Island City neighborhood, in Queens, New York. The Times reported that Amazon is also nearing a deal to have Crystal City, in Arlington, Virginia also host HQ2. New York City and Crystal City will reportedly split the second headquarters.\n\nOn Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is planning to split its second headquarters, crowning two HQ2 winners in two separate locations. Each of the HQ2 offices will create roughly 25,000 jobs, according to The Journal.\n\nAmazon is in the final days of its journey to decide which city or cities will host its second headquarters, with the company saying that its pick will be made before the end of 2018.\n\nThe company has said it plans to invest over $5 billion and accommodate as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs. If the company splits its second headquarters, each location will host 25,000 jobs, The Journal reports.\n\nAs a result, cities and states have been eager to offer Amazon massive incentives to win over the company.\n\nCompanies are offering billions of dollars in economic incentives. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, for example, approved $6.5 billion in tax incentives for Amazon, as well as an additional $2 billion in infrastructure and transportation improvements for Montgomery County, according to The Baltimore Sun.\n\nRead more: 7 horrible things that could happen to cities if they win Amazon's HQ2 bid\n\nNot everyone is pleased by the lengths city and state governments are willing to go to win over Amazon. A petition started by a group of elite economists earlier this year argues that cities \u2014 including the top contenders for HQ2 \u2014 should band together against such incentives because they \"divert funds that could be put to better use underwriting public services such as schools, housing programs, job training, and transportation.\"\n\nHowever, others \u2014 including Amazon and Gov. Cuomo \u2014 argue that the infusion of jobs that would accompany the new headquarters far outweighs the negatives.", "After Fox News and NBC pulled a controversial advertisement from President Trump that was widely condemned as racist, Facebook has decided to block the ad from paid distribution.\n\nThe ad, which claims the migrant caravan headed toward the United States consists of \"dangerous illegal criminals,\" can still be posted on Facebook, but not through the social network's paid advertisement distribution system, Bloomberg reports.\n\nFox News pulled the ad on Sunday, and NBC and Facebook quickly followed suit on Monday.\n\n\"This ad violates Facebook's advertising policy against sensational content, so we are rejecting it,\" a Facebook spokesperson said to Bloomberg in a statement. \"While the video is allowed to be posted on Facebook, it cannot receive paid distribution.\"\n\nFacebook defines sensational content as \"images that may shock or scare viewers, images that are scary, gory or sensational,\" and \"Ads depicting violence or threats of violence.\"\n\nFox News provided the following statement to Business Insider regarding its decision: \"Upon further review, Fox News pulled the ad yesterday and it will not appear on either Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network.\"\n\n\"After further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\" an NBC spokesman told Business Insider after the ad was aired on the network.\n\nCNN posted a statement on Twitter after deciding not to run the ad: \"CNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist,\" the statement said. \"When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined.

UBS predicted that this means AT&T will launch a higher-priced digital TV package and then reposition DirecTV Now as a \"skinnier bundle.\"\n\nUBS said if this happens, Viacom channels like MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central will likely be cut from DirecTV Now (which currently has about 2 million subscribers) and remain only on the new, higher-priced service.\n\n\"We see Viacom as a prime target of this re-tiering given the renewal, a lack of 'must have' content, low viewership relative to affiliate revenues, and lack of carriage on other vMVPDs [digital TV packages],\" UBS wrote. \"An unfavorable deal for Viacom could have long-tailed negative impacts.\"\n\nAt a basic level, UBS thinks Viacom will be hampered by two factors in negotiating with AT&T. First, relative to how much pay-TV subscribers actually watch Viacom channels, it charges high per-subscriber fees to distributors like AT&T.\n\nHere is a chart from UBS that shows this, particularly in relation to Discovery, a media company also oriented around unscripted TV shows (as opposed to sports, which has a different value calculation):\n\nUBS\n\nSecond, since many other digital TV packages \u2014 YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and PlayStation Vue \u2014 already do not carry Viacom channels, it's unlikely DirecTV Now subscribers will flee to other bundles if Viacom gets dropped.\n\nThese two factors mean that Viacom will not be in a good negotiating position with AT&T.\n\nSo what does UBS expect the damage to be?\n\nIt's now expecting total affiliate revenue of $3.74 billion in 2020, down from $3.92 billion in 2017, a decline of $178 million.\n\nThis isn't a death sentence for Viacom\n\nThough Viacom may be in for some near-term pain as the traditional pay-TV ecosystem continues to decline, UBS isn't suggesting Viacom is in a death spiral. In fact, UBS said it remained positive about overall turnaround efforts at Viacom.\n\n\"Viacom has made significant progress on its turnaround efforts, including returning Paramount to profitability (expected in FY19), expanding its advanced advertising business and accelerating growth in live events and TV production,\" UBS wrote. \"While we expect the company to continue to execute on these priorities, the vast majority of Viacom's earnings still come from the traditional pay-TV ecosystem. We expect Viacom to revise guidance for US advertising growth in FY19 due to worsening ratings headwinds.\"\n\nFundamentally, Viacom is stuck between its past as a cable network and a potentially bright future as a supplier of TV and movie content to emerging streaming platforms.\n\nIn June, MTV launched MTV Studios to make shows for streaming platforms, and the company announced last month that new seasons of \"The Real World\" would appear on Facebook Watch. Paramount will also make a sequel to Netflix's smash hit \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before.\"\n\nViacom has irons in the fire and a deep catalog of intellectual property that it can use to create new shows and movies, or reboot old ones (hello, new \"Jersey Shore\"). But it's tough math when you are fighting against the secular decline of cable and satellite-TV packages.\n\nThat's one reason why UBS still sees a merger with CBS as the \"most likely outcome\" for the company.\n\n\"A deal would provide Viacom with more negotiating leverage with distributors while giving CBS more content to feed it growing [direct-to-consumer] platforms,\" UBS wrote. It could hold its own in the present ecosystem while preparing for the future one.\n\nViacom declined to comment.\n\nIf you have any information about Viacom, DirecTV Now, or vMVPDs in general, contact the author at nmcalone@businessinsider.com.", "Netflix already released a behind-the-scenes video on its new horror series, \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" that takes a look at the show's standout sixth episode, \"Two Storms.\" But fans have been clamoring for more information on the five long takes that make up the episode, the longest being 17 minutes.\n\nDirector Mike Flanagan detailed how the episode was pulled off in a lengthy Twitter thread on Sunday and said the episode was \"part of the very first pitch for the show.\"\n\nFlanagan said most of the camera choreography was included in the script, which made it tough to read.\n\nThe sets for the haunted Hill House and Shirley's funeral home were built with episode six in mind. According to Flanagan, \"They were built on adjacent stages, and had to accommodate a hallway that would physically connect them so that Hugh could walk directly from the funeral home to Hill House in shot 1.\"\n\nFlanagan said the set had hiding places for the crew and equipment for when the long takes took place and there wasn't a place to cut the scene. He added that he wanted to shoot the episode last to give the crew and cast more time to prepare, but that didn't happen.\n\n\"Budget issues resulted in the studio moving the episode up to the beginning of our third production block, and rapidly accelerating our prep time,\" Flanagan explained. \"Production was shut down, rehearsals for ep 6 began March 6th, 2018. We rehearsed daily with our second team stand-ins, who performed the entire episode as actors as we learned the camera, lighting, and acting choreography. They were HEROES and made the whole thing possible.\"\n\nFlanagan said the studio also initially wanted to cut the storms from the episode to avoid paying for additional lights for lightning effects, and because water would sometimes flood the sets.\n\n\"This first segment involved hiding the younger actors playing the Crain children around the corner in the viewing room, so they could run in and replace their adult counterparts during a 360-degree move around Tim Hutton,\" Flanagan continued. \"The adults sprinted back into place a moment later.\"\n\nFlanagan said there was concern that the tight schedule would put pressure on the child actors, but it \"proved to be a non-issue, as they knew their lines cold (and even the adults' lines).\"\n\nTo conclude the thread, Flanagan said he and his wife Kate Siegel, who plays Theo on the show, learned she was pregnant with their second child the night before filming segment three.\n\n\"Made me really nervous every time I saw her fall down,\" Flanagan said. \"Added a special layer of nerves to the stress of the ep.\"\n\nTo see the entire thread, click here.", "If you've used Twitter at all recently, you've probably seen what looks like Elon Musk peddling a cryptocurrency \"giveaway\" on your timeline.

The scammers showed up frequently in Musk's mentions, often acting like they're continuing a thought that Musk left off in a real tweet. Then, they link out to a cryptocurrency scam, usually claiming Musk is doing a giveaway that requires users to send some of their own cryptocurrency to the scammer.\n\nRecently, however, these scams have ventured outside of Musk's mentions and into timelines.

Either way, it'll probably feel like an underwhelming purchase just to fulfill the need for a closet staple. If you're looking to adhere to the ideals of \"fewer, better\" \u2014 or you only want to devote closet space to things that genuinely bring you joy to wear, you should avoid these cheaper, sub-par options.\n\nDSTLD's $350 Leather Moto Jacket is an exception to this rule. It's a (relatively) affordable leather jacket that looks and feels like its designer quality, but for quite a few hundred dollars less. I've had mine for about a year, and it's a mainstay of my closet. People regularly ask me where I got it \u2014 including fellow product reviewers who have been aged into hyper-cynicism and selectivity. Over time, it's broken in to become one of the softest leather pieces I own, and the fit has become more customized \u2014 as you'd expect from a great leather jacket.\n\nThe DSTLD Leather Moto, like all of DSTLD's offerings, is a classic done extremely well. It has adjustable buckles at the waist for a perfectly customized fit from the outset, reinforced elbow patches, and an asymmetrical zipper with silver hardware accents. Its shape is contemporary thanks to its cropped silhouette, but that's it in terms of alterations that may otherwise date the staple. The leather is durable and felt thicker and tougher at first than expected at first, but over the past year has worn into a buttery softness. It has a light coating to add a soft sheen, enhance its lifespan, and give it an extra layer of stain protection.\n\nLeather loosens as it breaks in, but the adjustable buckles mean you'll remain in control of how your moto fits. Mine has loosened a bit over 12 months, but the size small is still perfect. As insurance, the startup offers free shipping, free returns, and a 100% fit guarantee.\n\nCurrently, the jacket comes in five styles: silver leather, white leather, black suede, smoke suede, and black leather with silver hardware \u2014 each for $350. DSTLD\n\nI first heard of DSTLD\u2014 an LA denim startup \u2014 last year when on the hunt for exactly this staple. Their product line is best-described as timeless essentials done mercilessly well \u2014 which, for a primarily online brand, could be seen as a thankless task. DSTLD pieces are a bit more expensive than the average person probably spends on each staple, but is made with the designer-level quality that fetches a way higher price at department stores.\n\nHowever, it's tough for the online shopper to know they're paying more for a far better deal \u2014 they can't touch the leather, stretch the under-$100 premium denim, or check the softness and opacity of the T-shirts online. And yet, the startup has earned a dependable reputation for itself and built a loyal consumer base \u2014 even inviting its shoppers to become investors\u2014 and has begun expanding to brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nThe DSTLD Leather Moto comes with adjustable buckles at the waist for a perfectly customized fit. DSTLD\n\nThe estimated traditional retail cost of the Leather Moto Jacket is $1,600, but it's listed on DSTLD for $350. \"Our jacket is not distinguishable from any other $900 leather jacket,\" DSTLD founder Corey Epstein told The Strategist, \"But it's the only one that's $350.\" That's one reason why we named it the best affordable leather jacket you can buy in the Insider Picks Buying Guides.\n\nCurrently, you can get the classic Leather Moto in five styles: silver leather, white leather, black suede, smoke suede, and black leather with silver hardware \u2014 each for $350.\n\nAll in all, DSTLD is a great one-stop shop for high-quality classics done in the urban uniform's monotone of black, grey, and white. But, if you buy one thing from the LA startup, it should be their $350 Leather Moto Jacket. It's one of the best deals you're likely to find if you're shopping for a classic leather jacket, and, in my experience, it's only gotten better with age.", "Turns out the hottest job of 2018 could be that of a DevOps engineer.\n\nLinkedIn just released its report on the most recruited jobs of 2018, showing that DevOps engineer was the most recruited job, followed by enterprise account executives and front-end engineers, in second and third place, respectively.\n\nThis job is in high demand, and the money shows it. According to Indeed, job postings for DevOps engineers shot up by 91% between 2014 and 2017. And the average base salary cashes in at $125,714, per the same data.\n\nAccording to the LinkedIn report, DevOps engineers are also the most recruited jobs specific to the engineering field, followed by frontend engineers and cloud architects.\n\nSo what does a DevOps engineer do, anyway?\n\nThe term DevOps is a portmanteau of development and operations, two roles that are vital to the field of software engineering. In short, the term refers to tools and practices that help engineers deliver and fix code on a more regular and faster basis, often multiple times a day \u2014 a practice pioneered by Facebook and its cohort.\n\nPreviously, developer teams would build and test the code, and operations teams would deploy and monitor the code. A DevOps engineer does both, and generally carries the end-to-end responsibility of developing, testing, deploying, monitoring, and improving the code.\n\nThat said, the relatively flashy new job title can be somewhat vague, and the responsibilities of the role can differ across companies.\n\nIndeed, engineers argue that DevOps is more of a culture and mindset than it is a single job. A DevOps engineer's responsibilities can overlap with those of other types of engineers, such as site-reliability engineers. And like other software engineers, DevOps engineers have to collaborate with their team to write and restructure code.\n\nAt the same time, these engineers must have the right skills to back up this mindset. DevOps engineers have to ensure that the software will work across different platforms, as well as frequently test and deploy their code.\n\nTo become a DevOps engineer, one should be able to use open-source technologies and automation tools and have strong skills in testing, coding, and scripting. People skills are also crucial, as the DevOps philosophy requires more collaboration among, well, developers and operations.\n\nStill, the very concept of DevOps has become a hot commodity in Silicon Valley: Investors are putting massive amounts of cash into DevOps startups that help their teams take advantage of this mindset. In that light, it's not surprising that companies are hiring for DevOps talent, too.\n\nAs for the rest of the top three: Front-end engineers build the user interface of websites and apps, which is a crucial part of any software team. Enterprise account executives manage business relationships with a company's most important customers, which speaks to the importance of the sales function.", "The Vietnam Military History Museum in Hanoi is one of six national museums in the country.\n\nOpened in 1959, the museum has thousands of military artifacts, everything ranging from small medals to large aircraft.\n\nIn fact, the museum even has several US aircraft, which were shot down in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, according to the museum's website.\n\nThe Vietnam War, which was fought from 1955 to 1975, killed about 58,200 US troops and as many as 2 million civilians. The US had military advisors in Vietnam in the 1950s, but didn't officially send combat troops there until 1965.\n\nThe museum also has US military vehicles that were purportedly captured during the Vietnam War.\n\nCheck them out below.", "Amazon is reportedly planning on crowning two winners of the company's search for a second headquarters, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe e-commerce giant \"plans to split its second headquarters evenly between two locations rather than picking one city for HQ2,\" a person familiar with the matter told The Journal. Each location would host roughly 25,000 Amazon employees.\n\nAccording to the source, the decision to have two HQ2 locations is related to the company's ability to recruit enough tech talent. Splitting the second headquarters would also ease issues related to housing and transit.\n\nRead more: 7 horrible things that could happen to cities if they win Amazon's HQ2 bid\n\nAmazon is in the final days of its journey to decide which city will host its second headquarters, with the company saying that its pick will be made before the end of 2018.

Amazon initially received 238 proposals from North American locations after the company announced plans to open a second headquarters in September 2017.\n\nAmazon declined to comment on The Wall Street Journal's report.

An Associated Press analysis revealed that 70% of those affected were black.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to Abrams and Kemp and will update this post with any comment.\n\nA familiar source\n\nThe Georgia robocall said it was paid for by TheRoadToPower.com, which the Anti-Defamation League calls \"a white supremacist and anti-Semitic broadcasting outlet based in Sandpoint, Idaho.\" The group's leader, Scott D. Rhodes, has reportedly been linked to the distribution of white supremacist material at a local high school, more anti-Semitic robocalls, anti-Semitic posts on Gab, and harassment of a local resident.\n\nThe organization has also been linked to multiple racist robocalls in recent elections.\n\nIn Florida, two racist robocalls targeting the state's first black gubernatorial nominee, Democrat Andrew Gillum, were reportedly funded by The Road to Power.\n\nIn August, The Road to Power funded a robocall in Charlottesville calling for the repeal of the 14th Amendment, which gave black people the right to vote.\n\nThe organization's first robocall supported neo-Nazi Patrick Little, claiming that Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein is an Israeli citizen and promising to \"rid America of the traitorous Jews.\"\n\nIn 2016, white nationalist Jared Taylor recorded a racist robocall urging people to vote for now-President Donadl Trump.\n\n\"We don't need Muslims,\" he said. \"We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump.\"\n\nAnother 2016 robocall to Iowans and Mississippi residents asked voters to choose a white supremacists candidate, warning of \"white genocide.\"", "As analysts fret that an economic downturn is on the horizon, you might feel a bit panicky.\n\nJoseph Sweis, a certified financial planner who founded Pearl Wealth Advisors, said investors should stay calm. \"We know markets go through cycles,\" he told Business Insider. \"It's happened all through history.\"\n\nSweis said the stock market had delivered an average annual return of about 10% on investments over the past 100 years, despite the stock market crash of 1929 and multiple recessions since then.\n\nBut he does have some practical suggestions to shore up your finances to better weather the next recession, whenever it comes.\n\nKnow your investment goals and stay the course\n\n\"Managing your emotions is just as important as managing your investments,\" Sweis said. Your investment strategy should be guided by your appetite for risk, he added, not predictions of a future recession.\n\nIf you won't dip into your money for several years, even an aggressive portfolio \u2014 such as 80% stocks and 20% bonds \u2014 is likely to recoup any losses over time, he said.\n\nRead more: My portfolio just lost $75,000 in 12 days \u2014 here's why I'm not worried at all\n\n\"Stick with your asset allocation and avoid market timing at all costs,\" Sweis said.\n\nInvestopedia describes market timing as \"the act of moving in and out of the market or switching between asset classes,\" including moving investments into cash to avoid losses. Sweis said some people, thinking a recession was coming, did this in 2016 and missed out on market gains.\n\nKeep saving for retirement\n\nIf you had a 401(k) or other retirement accounts during the 2008 recession, you might remember your balance going down even as you contributed money with each paycheck. Though this can be alarming, Sweis said, \"even though your bottom line is declining, you're buying more shares with every dollar.\" When stocks are down, investing is like buying at bargain-basement prices.\n\nRead more: 7 tips to help make saving for retirement easier, according to a financial planner\n\nSweis said your asset allocation \u2014 how much you invest in stocks, bonds, etc. \u2014 should be determined by how soon you plan to retire.\n\n\"If your goal is to use your money in less than one year, it should be cash and cash equivalents,\" he said. If you're more than eight years from retirement, you could hold more aggressive investments. As you get closer to the end of your work life, Sweis said, you should shift your asset allocation gradually to more conservative assets.\n\nGet out of debt\n\n\"One of the hallmarks of recession is that credit tightens up,\" Sweis said. \"Banks still want to lend, but they're only lending to the most qualified borrowers.\"\n\nIf you want access to credit, do what you can to pay down your debt and clean up your credit, Sweis said. That's good advice for any time, but it's particularly salient in a recession.\n\nDon't base your home-buying decision on the next recession\n\n\"At the end of the day, owning a home is a long-term investment,\" Sweis said. \"It's always better to buy at the bottom, but that's a very difficult thing to do.\"\n\nSweis said he didn't think there would be a housing crash in the near future because everyone who bought a home after 2010 was a qualified buyer. Still, market timing of the always unpredictable housing market is a recipe for trouble.\n\n\"If you're looking to buy a home, understand the impact to your overall debt and to your monthly cash flow and make sure it's manageable,\" Sweis said. And don't wait for the next recession if you're ready to buy now.\n\nSave at least 6 months' worth of living expenses\n\n\"If your focus is to prepare for a recession, make sure you have at least a six-month reserve in your bank account,\" Sweis said. \"You want to have a cushion to avoid going into debt during a rough time.\"\n\nRead more: A 7-step plan to building an emergency fund, even if you're starting from scratch\n\nThe savings will protect you if you lose your job \u2014 a major feature of the last recession. If you think it might be hard to find another job in your field, Sweis suggests holding a whole year's worth of basic living expenses in reserve.\n\nIf you can't save a lot, save a little \u2014 it adds up over time\n\nA CareerBuilder survey last year found that most Americans said they lived paycheck to paycheck, CNBC reported. If you're one of them, investing and saving might seem impossible. But according to Sweis, you have more power to save than you think.\n\n\"Don't underestimate the value of a disciplined budget and the value of compounding,\" he said. If you can invest just invest just $100 a month, you could eventually be a millionaire.\n\nWhether you have a lot of money or a little, Sweis said, \"discipline and strategy is what's going to get you through the recessions.\"", "Novartis has an ambitious decade ahead of it.\n\nThe company on Monday said it had identified 26 new therapies in the works that could potentially be blockbuster drugs for the Swiss pharma giant.\n\nThat includes treatments that came out of a deal Novartis struck in April when it bought gene therapy maker AveXis for $8.7 billion. The company's treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare genetic condition that affects muscle movement in children and is the leading genetic cause of mortality in infants.\n\nRead more: Pharma giants are betting billions on gene therapies that could fundamentally change how we treat diseases\n\nThe rundown of Novartis' pipeline comes shortly after the company cut about a fifth of its research and development programs in an attempt to narrow its focus.\n\nOf the 26 potential treatments Novartis highlighted, it anticipates filing 14 with the FDA for approval within the next three years.

But by 2021, the company expects that 14 could be making more than $1 billion in annual sales.

Even today, they remain equal partners in the business.\n\n\"It's us, doing this together,\" Raider said on an episode of Business Insider's podcast \"This Is Success,\" adding that \"creating unnecessary hierarchy would just complicate that dynamic.\"\n\n\"And so we feel like it is a partnership, and that our titles just reflect that partnership,\" he continued. \"We're also not precious about titles. I've never been like, you know, 'Oh I'm this title or that title.'\"\n\nToday the company has five million customers and has raised nearly half a billion dollars. Just this year, Harry's raised $112 million.\n\nBack when Harry's was in the beginning phases, Raider and his co-CEO had to figure out the best way to ship their razors, find a distribution partner, negotiate rates, and figure out the right protocols and processes. It was, Raider said, \"just way too much for any one person to do.\"\n\nNotably, this is not Raider's only experience in co-leadership: prior to Harry's, he was one of the four cofounders of Warby Parker, a company that also uses a co-CEO model.\n\nWorking through disagreements as cofounders and co-CEOs\n\nIf Raider and Katz-Mayfield disagree and cannot come to a logical solution, the co-CEOs present the issue to their advisors.\n\n\"There are times when we disagree, but we have a tremendous amount of mutual respect for each other. And so our disagreements are never personal. It's always just sort of objective, like what is the right answer to this specific question,\" Raider said.\n\nRaider noted that they shared a respect for each other's perspectives, as well as the ability to drive the business together. \"When it came to strategy, where are we taking the company, what do we want to build in the long term, I think that's where we spent more time together,\" he said.\n\nRead more:A startup CEO who's raised nearly $500 million says business strategy isn't what you do \u2014 it's what you don't\n\nRaider joked that he and Katz-Mayfield finish each other's sentences and with all the time they spend together, their corporate email should have been Jeff and Andy at Harry's, instead of individual addresses.\n\n\"I think having cofounders and co-CEOs in a company is great if you feel like you've got a great relationship with that other person and your skills complement each other well.\" Raider said. \"And it was helpful for us to be able to kind of divide and conquer in that way; trust each other, in an implicit way, that we were going to execute well on our individual pieces, and then, obviously, align on the areas of intersection on sort of the general vision for the business.\"", "Amazon is launching a new last-mile shipping program this holiday season.\n\nFor the first time, the company is planning to hire and manage thousands of full-time drivers to transport packages to customers from Amazon delivery outposts across the US, the company confirmed to Business Insider on Monday.\n\nAmazon will manage these drivers directly, meaning the company will set their wages, provide them delivery vehicles, and schedule their routes. The drivers are seasonal but will have the option to apply to continue their employment with Amazon following the holiday season.\n\n\"Seasonal employees have long been utilized to supplement capacity during peak shopping periods,\" an Amazon spokeswoman said. \"This holiday, thousands of full-time, seasonal Delivery Associates will deliver to customers during the busy retail shopping season.\"\n\nIn the past, instead of hiring drivers, Amazon has relied on delivery services provided by UPS, FedEx, and the US Postal Service, as well as contractors employed through its Flex delivery program and third-party courier companies it calls delivery service partners, or DSPs.\n\nThe company's move to hire its own drivers follows a recent push to expand its network of DSPs. Amazon has been trying to grow its delivery options as the company's shipping costs have exploded, nearly doubling from 2015 to 2017, to $21.7 billion.\n\nThe new delivery roles, however, could create some competition between Amazon and its contracted DSPs.\n\nUnlike drivers employed by DSPs, drivers employed by Amazon will qualify for the retailer's recently implemented $15 minimum hourly wage.\n\nJob postings for the new Amazon delivery jobs advertise hourly wages of $16.25 to $17.25. This could put some pressure on Amazon's DSPs to raise theirs to at least $15.\n\nAmazon also appears to be trying to create a more reasonable working environment for its own drivers.\n\nAt a training last week for new hires of the delivery program, an Amazon manager addressed Business Insider's reporting on Amazon-affiliated drivers who said they had urinated in bottles and skipped breaks on their delivery routes, according to an attendee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.\n\n\"They said they didn't want people peeing in bottles,\" this person said. \"They also said that people weren't taking lunch breaks, and they said we have to take those.\"\n\nRead more: The disturbing accounts of Amazon delivery drivers may reveal the true human cost of 'free' shipping\n\nShifts could still be strenuous and long, with the potential to last up to 12 hours, according to job postings for the new roles.\n\nA job posting describes Amazon's new delivery role: \"Under tight deadlines, drives a delivery van up to 10,000 pounds to many customer residences and businesses, climbs in and out of van, and walks up and down stairs as required to deliver packages according to established procedures in all weather conditions.\" It adds that candidates must have the \"ability to lift, bend, reach above the head, kneel, crouch, and/or stretch during shifts up to 12 hours long.\"\n\nAlso read:", "Marla Beck, cofounder and CEO of Bluemercury.

For comparison, NASA's Juno spacecraft zooms past the cloud tops of Jupiter at 130,000 mph once every two months.\n\nWhile the car-size Parker Solar Probe breaks humanity's speed record, it's also surviving some of the solar system's harshest conditions. Right now, it's screaming through the diffuse outer atmosphere of the sun, which is about 3.6 million degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNASA launched the robot in August aboard a powerful rocket \u2014 the start of a seven-year, $1.5 billion mission to decrypt some of the sun's greatest mysteries.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is expected to easily survive this solar flyby, though its operators won't know until later this week whether anything went wrong.\n\n\"For several days around the Nov. 5 perihelion\" \u2014 the term for the closest point to the sun during a given orbit \u2014 \"Parker Solar Probe will be completely out of contact with Earth because of interference from the sun's overwhelming radio emissions,\" the space agency said in a press release.\n\nThis orbit will bring the spacecraft within about 15 million miles of the sun's surface. That's about one-sixth of the distance from the Earth to the sun.\n\nHowever, this perihelion will be only the first of the Parker probe's 24 death-defying solar encounters.\n\nWhat's in store for the Parker Solar Probe\n\nThe orbital path that the Parker Solar Probe will have to fly to \"touch\" the sun. Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory\n\nOver the next seven years, the robot's orbits will get closer and closer to the sun. Its speed relative to the star will also increase, as will the hellish conditions it must survive.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe's perihelion in December 2024 (about 21 orbits from now) will accelerate it to nearly 430,000 mph and get it within 4 million miles of the sun. That's close enough to study the star's mysterious atmosphere, solar wind, and other properties more deeply than ever before.\n\nThe goal is to crack two 60-year-old mysteries: why the sun has a solar wind, and how the corona \u2014 the star's outer atmosphere \u2014 can heat up to millions of degrees, or about 100 times as hot as the sun's surface temperature of about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"That defies the laws of nature \u2014 it's like water rolling uphill,\" Nicola Fox, a solar physicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, said during a NASA press briefing in 2017. \"Until you actually go there and touch the sun, you can't answer these questions.\"\n\nBoth the solar wind and the corona are key to understanding solar storms, which can overwhelm electrical grids on Earth, harm our satellites, disrupt electronics, and possibly lead to trillions of dollars' worth of damage. Data collected by the probe's sensors might help space-weather forecasters better predict potentially devastating, violent solar outbursts.\n\nThe probe's maximum expected speed translates to nearly 120 miles per second, which would be fast enough to fly from New York to Tokyo in less than a minute and is 3.3 times as fast as the Juno spacecraft.\n\nTo achieve this feat, the probe has to zoom past Venus seven times; each flyby helps the robot correct its orbit to slip closer to the sun and boost its speed.\n\nOn September 25, during its first Venusian flyby, the probe turned back toward Earth and took the photo below. Our planet is the bright dot at the top right.\n\nA photo of Earth taken by the Parker Solar Probe near Venus on September 25. NASA/Naval Research Laboratory/Parker Solar Probe\n\nHow to fly through hell and back\n\nFor now, the searing-hot plasma that the plucky solar probe is withstanding is so diffuse that \"it doesn't influence the temperature of the spacecraft,\" NASA said.\n\nThe heat shield of NASA's Parker Solar Probe is craned into place atop the spacecraft on June 27. NASA\n\nBut the space agency added that the spacecraft's high-tech heat shield is the reason its temperature is so stable.\n\nThe shield, called the Thermal Protection System, always faces the sun and blocks its light. It also protects the probe and its sensors from a solar wind of charged, high-energy particles that can mess with electronics.\n\nThe 8-foot-wide shield is made of 4.5 inches of carbon foam sandwiched between two sheets of carbon composites, allowing it to absorb and deflect solar energy that might otherwise fry the probe. A water-cooling system is designed to help prevent the spacecraft's solar panels from roasting and keep the Parker probe at 85 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAlready, the surface of the heat shield has reached a temperature of about 820 degrees Fahrenheit. And it's only expected to get hotter as the probe continues its mission.\n\nDuring the most harrowing segment of its journey, NASA's probe must withstand sunlight 3,000 times as strong as what occurs at Earth. Outside the spacecraft, temperatures during this pass may reach 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. (If steel were heated to this temperature, the metal would melt into a liquid.)\n\nThe probe's mission will continue for about seven years, or until it runs out of the propellant necessary to keep the heat shield pointed at the sun.\n\nWhen that happens, the star's blistering heat will burn up \"90% of the spacecraft,\" Shannon Stirone, a science writer, said on Twitter\u2014 but not the heat shield itself.\n\n\"The heat shield will then orbit the sun for millions of years,\" she said.", "Websites aren't dead.\n\nEven as more web distribution moves to social platforms, San Francisco-based Brandcast is betting big on websites.

Brandcast\n\nSocial media killed websites. Now they're back.\n\nA few years ago, brands seemed to ditch websites and look to social media for distribution and tried to sell things on platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"For a while up until very recently, social media appeared to be the panacea for these brands, but they are starting to find that they're too limited as a brand by the confines of a Facebook Page and the format that you have for Facebook or Twitter,\" Yanowitch said. \"And they have to pay a toll for every interaction with a consumer.\"\n\nOn top of that, Facebook and Twitter are struggling with hacking, bots, and trustworthiness.\n\n\"There's this new phase where CMOs and digital innovation teams are realizing that they have to manage a much bigger portfolio of URLs and digital experiences \u2014 they have to be in many places at once,\" he said. \"Rather than go back to their website, they're creating a whole new generation of websites with marketing dollars.\"\n\nBrands are reinvesting advertising money into technology\n\nIncreasingly, brands like Nike are shifting money from advertising into services that provide so-called \"digital transformations\" like user experience, data, and technology. Those aren't things that traditional ad agencies usually specialize in, and a crop of consultancies promise to help brands manage all of it in addition to handling their advertising.\n\nOther brands are cutting out some of their partners and moving technology and marketing in-house. Yanowitch said Brandcast works with both agencies and in-house marketers.\n\n\"One of the reasons this is taking off is [because] it is viewed as one of the fastest ways to make progress in digital transformation for these important brands,\" he said. \"It allows them to create this ecosystem of collaboration with in-house teams, external teams, with all the technology being taken care of up in the cloud.\"", "Noah Berger / AP Photo\n\nTesla surged two weeks ago when it posted a surprise third-quarter profit, with shares up as much as 20%.

Meanwhile, mentioning how bored you could hurt the feelings of your conversation partner.\n\nBut that's exactly what one expert recommends to inject life into a dead conversation.\n\nPsychologist Marshall B. Rosenberg wrote in his 2003 book \"Nonviolent Communication\" that interrupting someone can be a powerful conversational tool that leads to more shared empathy between people.\n\nIn his book, Rosenberg argues that communication breaks down when people fail to articulate their needs and feelings. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella famously made the members of his senior leadership team read the book when he took over in 2014.\n\n\"Our intention in interrupting is not to claim the floor for ourselves, but to help the speaker connect to the life energy behind the words being spoken,\" Rosenberg writes in the book.\n\nRead more: When CEO Satya Nadella took over Microsoft, he started defusing its toxic culture by handing each of his execs a 15-year-old book by a psychologist\n\nAt one point, Rosenberg described a cocktail party he attended in which he was \"in the midst of an abundant flow of words that to me seemed lifeless.\" He decided to take matters into his own hands:\n\n\"Excuse me,\" Rosenberg said to the other members of his conversation circle. \"I'm feeling impatient because I'd like to be more connected with you, but our conversation isn't creating the kind of connection I'm wanting. I'd like to know if the conversation we've been having is meeting your needs, and if so, what needs of yours are being met through it.'\"\n\nAs might be expected, the other people in the group \"stared at me as if I had thrown a rat in the punch bowl,\" Rosenberg wrote. Recognizing their surprise, he asked the original speaker, \"Are you annoyed with my interrupting because you would have liked to continue the conversation?\"\n\nHis answer shocked him even more.\n\n\"No, I'm not annoyed,\" the speaker said. \"I was thinking about what you were asking. And no, I wasn't enjoying the conversation; in fact, I was totally bored with it.\"\n\nRosenberg said the experience taught him the value of interrupting someone, even though it can be hard to muster the courage to actually speak up. To remedy that, he recommends chiming in before it's too late.\n\n\"I'd suggest the best time to interrupt is when we've heard one word more than we want to hear,\" Rosenberg wrote. \"The longer we wait, the harder it is to be civil when we do step in.\"\n\nHe later conducted an informal survey asking people the following question: \"If you are using more words than somebody wants to hear, do you want that person to pretend to listen or to stop you?\" All but one respondent said they preferred to be stopped, he wrote.\n\n\"Their answers gave me courage by convincing me that it is more considerate to interrupt people than to pretend to listen,\" he wrote. \"All of us want our words to enrich others, not to burden them.\"", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Each Hawaiian island is as diverse as it is beautiful, but they all feature stunning beaches and dynamic landscapes that will take your breath away.\n\nLush greenery, volcanoes, waterfalls, and crystal-clear waters perfect for surfing and scuba are the norm in this tropical paradise, making any vacation there a dream come true for both nature lovers and lovers of water and sea life. The only problem? Hawaii is notoriously expensive to visit, both due to the exorbitant costs of airfare and the high prices of hotels.\n\nFortunately, many travel credit cards make it possible to rack up rewards perfect for an epic Hawaii trip. If two spouses were to pick up two cards and earn the sign-up bonuses on both, they could even get both their hotels and their airfare fully covered for the Hawaiian vacation of a lifetime.\n\nRead more: Most people think paying $450 a year for a hotel credit card is insane \u2014 here's why I signed up for the Hilton Aspire anyway\n\nHawaiian Airlines World Elite Mastercard\n\nLike any trip, the first detail you'll need to handle for your journey to Hawaii is airfare. For this component of your trip, you should consider picking up the Hawaiian Airlines World Elite Mastercard.\n\nNot only does the Hawaiian Airlines World Elite Mastercard offer 50,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 within 90 days of account opening, but you also earn 3x points on Hawaiian Airlines purchases, 2x points on gas, dining, and grocery store purchases, and 1x points on all other purchases. You also get a free checked bag on Hawaiian Airlines flights, along with a $100 annual companion discount and no foreign transaction fees.\n\nCurrently, Coach SuperSaver flights from the US mainland to Hawaii are just 20,000 miles one-way or 40,000 miles round-trip. You can also fly within the Hawaiian Islands for just 7,500 miles one-way with a Coach SuperSaver fare.\n\nAs a result, each person who signs up for the card and earns the sign-up bonus would have enough miles for a round-trip open-jaw fare into Hawaii and one intra-island flight at the very least. This makes this card perfect for a couple who both get the card and want to visit two islands during their trip. For example, a couple could use 20,000 miles each to fly into Oahu, 7,500 miles each to fly from Oahu to Kauai, then 20,000 miles to fly home to the US from Kauai.\n\nOn top of their airline miles redeemed, however, each person would need to pay government-mandated airline taxes and fees of $5.60 per leg.\n\nThe Hawaiian Airlines World Elite Mastercard also charges a $99 annual fee.\n\nHilton Honors American Express Ascend Card\n\nWhen it comes to covering your Hawaiian hotels, focusing on the Hilton Honors hotel loyalty program is an absolute no-brainer. This is mainly due to the fact that there are so many Hilton hotels all over Hawaii, but it's also due to the fact the Hilton Honors American Express Ascend Card makes it so easy to rack up points.\n\nCurrently, the Hilton Honors American Express Ascend Card is offering 125,000 bonus Hilton Honors points after you spend $2,000 on your card within three months of account opening. You also earn 12x points on all your Hilton Honors purchases, 6x points at restaurants, supermarkets, and gas stations in the US, and 3x points on all other purchases.\n\nFinally, this card comes with no foreign transaction fees, automatic Hilton Gold status, and a free weekend night award from Hilton Honors after you spend $15,000 on purchases on your card within a calendar year. This card does charge a $95 annual fee.\n\nWhile the points you need for a free night can vary at Hilton properties depending on dates and demand, some of your hotel options include:\n\nGrand Naniloa Hotel Hilo \u2014 a DoubleTree by Hilton : 40,000 Hilton Honors points and up\n\n: 40,000 Hilton Honors points and up Hilton Garden Inn Waikiki Beach : 49,000 Hilton Honors points and up\n\n: 49,000 Hilton Honors points and up Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort : 58,000 Hilton Honors points and up\n\n: 58,000 Hilton Honors points and up Hilton Garden Inn Kauai Wailua Bay : 45,000 Hilton Honors points and up\n\n: 45,000 Hilton Honors points and up Grand Wailea, a Waldorf Astoria Resort: 95,000 Hilton Honors points and up\n\nThese are just some of the Hilton properties you could choose from, but there are plenty of others. Also note that Hilton Silver members and those with higher status receive a 5th night free when they book certain five-night stays with Hilton Honors points. The Hilton Honors programs also lets you pool your points with up to 10 people within the program, which makes it a winner for couples who want to combine their points together for optimal travel redemptions.\n\nAs an example of how this could work, let's say that two partners both signed up for the Hilton Honors American Express Ascend Card and earned the 125,000 bonus Hilton Honors points. This would leave the couple with 250,000 bonus points total not counting points they earned on their regular spending.\n\nIf they wanted to spend five nights at the Hilton Garden Inn Waikiki Beach at 49,000 Hilton Honors points per night, they could combine and cash in 196,000 of their points for four free nights and get their fifth night free provided standard award nights were available during their entire reservation period. They could also break their stay up across a few of Hawaii's famous islands, redeeming points for a few free nights at each.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nIf you're angling for a trip to Hawaii this year, a handful of rewards cards can make travel an especially cheap proposition. You'll still have to pay for food and fun, but having your airfare and hotels covered can help you stretch your travel budget much farther than most people realize.", "For the second time this decade, LeBron James has left the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the team has seemingly collapsed in on itself.\n\nJames' departure for the Miami Heat in 2010, of course, left the team in dire straights as they toiled in the NBA's abyss, collecting lottery picks and racking up 20-win seasons until James returned in 2014.\n\nFrom the looks of things, James' latest departure isn't any different. Through nine games, the Cavs are an NBA-worst 1-8, with the worst point differential in the league.\n\nAs The Athletic's Joe Vardon revealed in a damning report, there are systemic issues on the team that paint an even uglier picture of the post-LeBron landscape.\n\nAt the heart of the issue, according to Vardon, seems to be organizational disagreement about the direction of the team. According to Vardon, when James left, some of the veteran Cavs players were under the impression they would be moved to different teams so the Cavs could start a rebuild. However, despite James moving, the team decided they wanted to stay competitive and fight for the playoffs.\n\nVardon reported that veteran wing Kyle Korver signed with the Cavs under the premise that if James left, he would be moved elsewhere. From Vardon:\n\n\"The first player Altman ever signed to a contract as GM was Kyle Korver. It was a three-year, $22 million deal inked in July of 2017, but it came with an understanding: If LeBron were to leave, the Cavs would either trade Korver or buy him out of the deal so he could move his family to his next team during the summer. So when LeBron left July 1 for the Lakers, Korver asked for the Cavs to move him. They refused because, they told him, they wanted him to play and for the team to try and win.\"\n\nThe decision to compete for the playoffs, sans LeBron, seems to have created issues on the roster, namely in acquiring young players to kick-start a rebuild around the team's veterans.\n\nThe Cavs used the eighth pick in the draft to take 19-year-old point guard Collin Sexton. Their biggest free agency moves included signing young, talented players like David Nwaba and Sam Dekker in hopes of giving them chances to improve.\n\nAccording to Vardon, after two losses to start the season, head coach Tyronn Lue sat his veterans, who he preferred, to play younger players. But when the team still didn't win, Lue turned back to his veterans, going against the wishes of GM Koby Altman and the front office. The move still didn't result in wins, so with Lue and Altman at odds, Lue was fired.\n\nThat has only opened up new cans of worms.\n\nInterim head coach Larry Drew has pushed back against the label of \"interim\" head coach, requesting more money and job security for himself and his coaching staff. Drew has made his requests public, and Vardon reported that players don't feel Drew has the proper command of the locker room because he doesn't have any long-term security.\n\nRead more: The Cavaliers are in an awkward stalemate with interim head coach Larry Drew just days after promoting him\n\nWhile that tug-of-war continues, Smith has publicly requested a trade, upset about him playing time. Meanwhile, Kevin Love, fresh off signing a four-year, $120 million extension, had to undergo foot surgery that could keep him out for over a month.\n\nThere's more! According to Vardon, Cavs players have also become disenchanted with Sexton, one of the young players the front office wants to devote more playing time.\n\nAccording to Vardon, some players increasingly believe he can't play, questioning his ability to run an offense, score efficiently, set up teammates, then play defense on the other end. Vardon reported that the issues don't have much to do with Sexton as a person, and his teammates understand he's only 19, but that his performances have not won many people over.\n\nIncreasingly, it looks like the Cavs' best path is to blow it up \u2014 exactly what they decided not to do when James left.\n\nThere are real benefits to that plan. The Cavs owe their 2019 first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks unless it lands in the top-10. Currently, the Cavs are on pace to keep that pick, but it wouldn't hurt to trade off some of their veteran players.\n\nESPN's Zach Lowe has reported that the Cavs signed Love to such a big extension to make it easier to trade him \u2014 the contract security that comes with an extension is more enticing than trading for Love before he hits free agency. It's unclear what the Cavs could get in return for Love now, but perhaps they could land another asset or young player to continue their rebuild.\n\nIssues within the organization were only thinly veiled in recent years, even with James on the roster. The Cavs went all-in to build around him, and the aftermath was always going to be ugly. But at least in recent years, the winning masked some issues.\n\nNow the team appears to be heading back toward the NBA's doldrums, and it's hard to imagine the present situation continuing. The Cavs thought they could smoothly transition between eras \u2014 remaining competitive with a veteran roster built around Love while their young players slowly developed and took center stage.\n\nInstead, it appears their only path forward it to begin anew and usher in an entirely new era.", "Kenan Thompson refused to defend a controversial joke his \"Saturday Night Live\" castmate Pete Davidson made over the weekend.\n\nDavidson stirred up controversy during a segment on Weekend Update on Saturday, when he made fun of the appearance of Texas Congressional candidate Dan Crenshaw, who lost an eye during a tour of duty in Afghanistan.\n\nDavidson commented that he looked like \"a hit man in a porno movie.\" When the joke didn't land, he laughed it off, saying \"I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in war or whatever.\"\n\nThe joke made headlines over the weekend, with many calling for Davidson to apologize to Crenshaw.

At a human level, it's hard not to empathise.\"\n\nLovett added that the pair had not yet met with Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, but planned to later this year.\n\nTim Berners-Lee has battered Facebook and Google for bad behaviour\n\nBerners-Lee has has been highly critical of Facebook and Google and their impact on the web.\n\nHe warned Reuters on Thursday about tech firms monopolising the web and said there was no alternative to \"really coming in and breaking things up.\" He didn't name Google or Facebook, but it was clear he was referring to Silicon Valley firms.\n\nAnother pet project of Berners-Lee is to decentralise the web, something that would naturally involve defanging the likes of Facebook and Google, which exert a ton of influence over the internet.\n\nThe contract, Lovett said, is only the first of several stages. The idea is to turn the principles into something that the UN or the G7 might adopt, with governments and firms holding themselves accountable for sticking to the agreement.\n\nIt all sounds a little quixotic and vague, but Lovett thinks there will be tangible results. Accountability, he said, might involve an annual report that tests how different companies and governments are holding up.\n\n\"The criticism that this could just be happy-clappy would be justified if we were going to just stop next week. If we only got as far as these principles, that's only worth so much,\" he said. \"The process we have at the second stage is to turn these principles into more concrete commitments... the third stage of the process would be an accountability mechanism.\n\n\"I accept you can only judge this some months down the line.\"", "Saudi Arabia is undergoing a massive construction boom. A November report found that the nation had about 4,700 active construction projects, worth a total of $852 billion.\n\nBut the future of some of these projects is less certain following the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which prompted many investors to rethink their contributions.\n\nIn late October, prominent figures like Y Combinator's Sam Altman and former US energy secretary Ernest Moniz temporarily pulled out of the plan for a $500 billion megacity.\n\nWhile the development is still moving forward, others could also be in peril. Billionaire Richard Branson recently severed ties with two tourism projects in the area due to similar concerns. In a statement, Branson said the Khashoggi murder could \"change the ability of any of us in the West to do business with the Saudi government.\"\n\nA lack of international support could hinder Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan, which aims to diversify Saudi Arabia's oil-driven economy.\n\nHere are some of the most expensive projects slated to go up in Saudi Arabia.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

In the view of Detroja, who coauthored a book on key business strategies in tech, \"Swipe to Unlock,\" a better move for Lyft's business would be an acquisition by Amazon.\n\nThe deal would benefit both companies by solving their key pain points, Detroja says: Amazon's signature subscriber offering of two-day shipping is costly and difficult to execute, and Lyft has yet to make significant progress entering international markets.\n\nRead More:A researcher rode more than 5,000 miles with Uber and Lyft and discovered the biggest differences between the two ride-hailing giants\n\nIf Amazon acquired Lyft, the company could use drivers' trunks to make deliveries when they aren't picking up riders. In turn, Lyft could compete on a global stage against Uber by tapping into Amazon's rapidly growing international Prime-subscriber base.\n\nHow Amazon's last-mile delivery pains could be relieved\n\n\"If you look at ridesharing, the fundamental problem is that it's incredibly difficult to open a new market because you need a steady base of both drivers and passengers for the service to work,\" Detroja says. \"The costs to do that are insane.\"\n\nWith a Lyft acquisition by Amazon, Detroja suggests, the shopping giant could offer Prime subscribers discounted rides \u2014 which could open new markets for the ride-share company overnight. In turn, Lyft could acquire new drivers by offering better pay than its biggest rival, Uber, by using the empty space in drivers' trunks to courier Amazon packages to Prime subscribers.\n\nAmazon has already looked into acquiring a driver base that would corner last-mile food delivery, Detroja points out. In September, The Telegraph reported that Amazon engaged in early-stage acquisition talks with the European courier service Deliveroo twice in recent months.\n\nA Lyft customer entering a car in San Francisco. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n\"The logistics of Amazon's last-mile food delivery are so expensive,\" Detroja says. \"There's also gaps with ridesharing. What if Lyft drivers had food or items in their trunk that they could deliver along passenger-pickup routes?\"\n\nDetroja acknowledges a few obvious snafus with this theory: A trunk full of packages be a problem for passengers traveling with luggage, and a deluge of riders may cause issues ensuring timely package delivery.\n\n\"Of course there's intricacies here that would need to be sorted out,\" he says.\n\n\"As Amazon grows in established markets, what they're trying to do is outspend and out-offer their competitors. For instance, free two-day shipping wasn't even a thing until Amazon pioneered it \u2014 they're forcing everyone's hands.\"\n\nUber's valuation may suffer as a result\n\nDetroja also points out that if Lyft and Amazon teamed up, they'd be formidable contenders against Uber.\n\n\"Uber and Lyft have tried to engage in a price war, but their prices will always be in within 5% of each other,\" he says. \"If they tried to compete for better prices forever, it would be a race to zero. But if Amazon owned Lyft, they could pass on savings to the consumer. It's the same strategy Amazon used to offer people video and music services.\"\n\nAdditionally, with a Lyft acquisition, Amazon would acquire yet another interesting asset, Detroja notes: Lyft's self-driving technology, which highlights an area that Amazon has expressed growing interest in over the past year.\n\nDetroja predicts an acquisition would have a direct effect on Uber's multibillion-dollar valuation. \"I think Uber's valuation would be cut substantially,\" Detroja says. And, if the acquisition took place before Uber's initial public offering \u2014 which, like Lyft's, is reportedly expected to take place in 2019 \u2014 Detroja says, the company might need a new valuation before going public. \"Uber would take a huge hit in market share overnight,\" Detroja says.", "AB, a $550 billion manager, is betting it can win back individual investors who have abandoned active products, such as mutual funds, in favor of lower-fee passive funds.\n\nThe New York-based manager's solution is a hybrid model of the strategies, one that the industry may be slow to replicate, said AB's CEO.\n\n\"We need to provide an inducement for clients to try active again,\" AB CEO Seth Bernstein said at Monday's Bank of America Merrill Lynch Future of Financials conference. \"They want to see better alignment of interests with the manager and end results.\"\n\nManagers including AB and Allianz Global Investors have launched these hybrid funds, which charge fluctuating fees based on performance, in the last year to compete with low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds. These passive products charge much lower fees than their mutual fund counterparts and have largely outperformed active strategies, leading investors to abandon them en masse.\n\nActive funds saw $58.8 billion of outflows in the year ending September 30, while passive funds drew in $510.1 billion over the same time, according to Morningstar research.\n\nEarlier this year, New York-based AB launched six products under the FlexFee Funds umbrella. The actively-managed strategy sees fees change based on one-year performance: when a fund underperforms a benchmark, investors pay low fees akin to those of an exchange-traded fund. After outperformance, fees increase, up to a cap.\n\nBernstein said that managers of such fulcrum funds sacrifice some performance fees compared to managing purely active products, a hurdle for investment managers considering the strategy.\n\n\"I for one am not really surprised by the industry's resistance to doing it,\" he said. \"It's hard to predict where it's going. I think it makes sense for us, though.\"\n\nOther managers in the space include Allianz, which launched a suite of products in December. At least 10 managers are considering the strategy, according to an executive who has met with interested companies. Would-be managers are monitoring inflows to current fulcrum funds before launching their own, the source said.\n\n\"It's going to take time,\" Bernstein said on Monday. \"We've been really consistent in saying this is a multi-year rollout for us.\"", "Why you'll love it: The Amex Gold Card has a lower annual fee than the Platinum Card, but it offers stellar rewards on dining and groceries and solid benefits.\n\nWelcome offer: 25,000 Membership Rewards points when you spend $2,000 in the first three months. Until January 9: Get up 20% back at US restaurants within the first three months, up to $100 total.\n\nThis October, American Express launched a massive reboot of its Premier Rewards Gold card, or \"PRG,\" rebranding it as the American Express Gold Card, releasing a new metal design and limited-edition rose gold version, and totally overhauling the rewards and benefits on the card. Because that wasn't quite enough, AmEx also launched a fairly unique new welcome bonus.\n\nRight now, this is arguably the best card available for food, unless you're only interested in cash back, rather than potentially more valuable rewards points, and unless you find yourself abroad at restaurants often.\n\nThe new Gold Card earns 4x points at US restaurants and on up to $25,000 per year at US supermarkets (and 1x point after that), 3x points on flights booked directly with the airline, and 1x point on everything else. Based on the fact that you can easily redeem Membership Rewards points for more than 1\u00a2 of value each, that makes this the highest-earning card for everything food-related.\n\nLike the old PRG, the Gold Card offers a $100 airline fee credit each calendar year, and adds up to $120 of dining credits \u2014 split into $10 each month \u2014 at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Steak House, or participating Shake Shack locations.\n\nNew card members \u2014 those who haven't previously had the Premier Rewards Gold \u2014 can earn a welcome bonus of 25,000 points when they spend $2,000 in the first three months. Additionally, those who apply before January 9 can get 20% back on all US restaurant charges \u2014 up to $100 total \u2014 in the form of a statement credit.\n\nWhile it's difficult to assign an exact value to Membership Rewards points, The Points Guy subjectively estimates each point as worth 1.9\u00a2. That makes the welcome bonus worth $575 \u2014 $475 for the points, and up to $100 back from restaurants. Even without factoring in the annual credit benefits, that's more than enough to make up for the card's $250 annual fee.\n\nCheck out our full review for more details.\n\nKeep in mind that it's possible to be targeted for a higher welcome bonus.\n\nPros: Stellar rewards on dining and groceries, useful benefits, lower annual fee than the Platinum Card.\n\nCons: Relatively high annual fee compared to some other cards.", "Apple's latest MacBook Air and 2018 MacBook Pros physically disconnect their own microphones when you close the lid, preventing eavesdropping hackers from listening in to conversations when you think the computer is in sleep mode with the lid closed.\n\nIt's Apple's \"T2\" security chip that the company includes in its latest lineup of MacBook Air and MacBook Pros that physically disconnects the microphones when the lid is closed. With a physical disconnection, software-based attacks like the FruitFly malware can't enable the microphone.\n\nThe cameras on the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pros aren't disconnected, however, as the \"field of view is completely obstructed when the lid is closed,\" Apple says in its T2 security chip documentation.\n\nPhysically disconnecting the microphone when a laptop's lid is closed is a good step towards better security, but it doesn't remove the risk of eavesdropping when the laptop's lid is open when it's being used, or even when it's gone to sleep with the lid open. There's no way to physically disconnect the microphone when a Mac laptop's lid is open, but some Mac apps like Oversight can at least notify you if your microphone has been enabled without your knowledge.\n\nFor total security against microphone-based malware, Apple would need to add some kind of physical switch to its laptops. Perhaps the company can take inspiration from its own iPhone's notification silent-switch, which switches the iPhone to vibrate-only mode. Adding that kind of a switch to a laptop would provide the best level of control and security since users could physically switch off the microphone for peace of mind (regardless of whether or not they're actualy using the laptop) and simply turn the mic back on when they need it.", "The moat outside the Tower of London was lit up with 10,000 torches Sunday night, in a dazzling display to honor those killed in World War I.\n\nThe moving ceremony will continue every night through November 11, which marks Remembrance Day in the UK \u2014 the anniversary of the end of the Great War.\n\nThis year marks 100 years since the war's end, so Tower of London officials wanted to mark the event with a grand display.\n\nHere are 16 more incredible more photos from the event.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

The marriage of Amazon's smart assistant with Sonos' great-sounding speaker was so successful I called it the \"ultimate smart speaker for music lovers\" in my review, and I stand by that.\n\nHay may not be as well known in the US, but the design firm has collaborated with many well-established companies (including Ikea) to bring its minimalist, modern design sense to America.

The Google Assistant will also be able to access other Google services, like Google Calendar, so you'll be able to check your schedule by asking the One.\n\nHaving Alexa, the Google Assistant, and AirPlay 2 support in a single speaker makes the One unique in a world where most smart speakers only work with one. These smart features are all a bonus on top of a really great-sounding speaker, whose audio quality has constantly impressed me over the past year.\n\nIf you've started working on your holiday shopping early, and have an music lover on your list who wants a cool-looking speaker, this is the perfect gift.

It was set up by Nobuyuki Sakakibara, the former president of Pride Fighting Championship, in 2015, and has organized 15 shows to date.\n\nRizin has focused on grand prix events, where athletes are drawn into a knockout-style bracket in which the winner stays on to compete in another fight, sometimes on the same night, until the last man standing \u2014 the grand prix winner \u2014 is eventually declared.\n\nHowever, a lot of shows follow the more traditional format of a set number of individual fights fought between two combatants. Rizin's next show, Rizin 14 \u2014 Saitama, is one of those events \u2014 and Mayweather and Nasukawa will headline it.\n\nProminent Rizin athletes include the Brazilian jiu-jitsu hall-of-fame member Gabi Garcia, the former Dream and One lightweight champion Shinya Aoki, and the former Pride heavyweight king Fedor Emelianenko, who is considered the greatest heavyweight in MMA history.\n\nBut a show featuring Mayweather tops anything Rizin has ever accomplished before \u2014 not only because they've managed to lure the unbeaten prizefighter to Japan, but also because they now have a show that will be watched around the world, on one of the biggest fight nights in Asia.\n\nSakakibara confirmed the event on Twitter, writing, \"Imagine these 2 fighting each other on NYE in the RIZIN ring!\"\n\nTickets for the Saitama show on New Year's Eve will range between $70 and $250 and will be \"sold out fast,\" according to Bruno Massami, the MMA news editor of the Brazilian media company Gazeta Esportiva.\n\nWho is Tenshin Nasukawa, and is he any good?\n\nNasukawa wasn't even born when Mayweather made his debut as a professional boxer in 1996. Nasukawa, born two years later in 1998, is 20 years old and half the age of Mayweather, who turns 42 in February 2019.\n\nDespite Nasukawa's age, he remains one of the best up-and-coming talents in Asian MMA. He fought 104 amateur fights by the age of 18, winning an incredible 99 times. As a pro, he has entered 27 kickboxing bouts, winning all, 20 of them by knockout. He has also won each of his four MMA fights.\n\nNasukawa, like Mayweather, is used to winning. But that's not all. \"He's young, very strong, very fast, and he's undefeated,\" Mayweather said, according to MMAjunkie. \"It's obvious he's doing something right to be where he's at. So I'm proud of him.\"\n\nOn being offered a fight against Mayweather, the BBC reported that Nasukawa was surprised. \"It was a surprise offer but I accepted without hesitation,\" Nasukawa said. \"It's the biggest moment in my life and I want to be the man who changes history. I'll do that with these fists, with one punch \u2014 just watch.\"\n\nWill the fight be MMA rules or boxing rules?\n\nRight now, it's unclear.\n\nWhat is clear is that there is a very noticeable height and weight difference between the 5-foot-8 Mayweather, who tends to compete around the 147-pound to 154-pound weight category, and 5-foot-4 Nasukawa, who fights in the flyweight and bantamweight divisions, which have 125-pound and 135-pound weight limits, respectively.\n\n\"As far as the rule set and the weight and the rules, we still have some work cut out for us,\" Sakakibara said, according to MMAjunkie. \"But it will be a great fight that everybody will be so excited to see. I'm so happy that Mr. Nasukawa accepted this offer in a flash.\"\n\nThe BBC reported that, according to Mayweather, the weight division and the rules and regulations would be discussed \"within the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nJohn Morgan, a reporter for MMAjunkie, tweeted: \"Pure hearsay at this point, but I was told from a reliable source that the current plan for Mayweather on NYE isn't MMA, but specific rules not known yet. However, it would be an exhibition of three, three-minute rounds.\"\n\nMassami, meanwhile, expects a \"standup bout with kicks.\"\n\nA variation of a kickboxing bout could be what materializes, as Mayweather said at a news conference on Monday that the bout would be \"special\" and he would be \"giving the people something they've never seen before.\"\n\nShould I care about this fight?\n\nMayweather.

Mayweather, boxing's biggest-ever pay-per-view attraction, has never ventured outside of his sport, so if the rules include one kick, let alone all permitted kicks in kickboxing, then Mayweather enters unchartered territory against an undefeated Japanese fighter, in Japan, who is half his age.\n\nBut there are many unknowns. If ever you read the words \"exhibition fight,\" then you can safely presume that means \"glorified spar\" \u2014 which is not worth a box office fee.\n\nKevin Iole, a combat columnist for Yahoo Sports, believes it could be even weirder than an exhibition fight. \"We don't know if it's a real fight or something scripted like pro wrestling,\" he wrote.\n\nRegardless, Mayweather has made a cameo appearance at a pro wrestling event before, when he found a way to \"win\" against the Big Show, a huge man who is 16 inches taller than he is, at WrestleMania XXIV in 2008.\n\nThat event still generated over 1 million pay-per-view buys.\n\nNo matter what the rules of this fight are, or if this is even a fight at all, one thing is for sure \u2014 Mayweather will make money and will be headline news the next day.\n\nHow much money will Floyd Mayweather earn?\n\nMayweather, as he will tell you himself, is a billionaire and became boxing's first billion-dollar fighter, according to Forbes.\n\nIt is therefore unlikely that Mayweather would get out of bed, let alone fight, without a considerable sum of money on the table.\n\n\"Bank on this: Mayweather is going to be paid, and handsomely,\" Iole wrote. \"No one said how much Mayweather will make, but you can bet he wouldn't have taken the bout had he not been guaranteed a nine-figure paycheck.\"\n\nWhat this means is simple. Mayweather could be looking at another $100 million paycheck.", "A Russian Su-27 fighter made a dangerous pass ahead of a US Navy EP-3 Aries taking part in a NATO military exercise in international air space above the Black Sea on Monday.\n\nThe US Navy released video of the incident, which clearly shows the Su-27 sharply turning in front of the plane with its engines blaring. Jet engines produce \"jet wash,\" or wake turbulence, which poses a serious risk to nearby aircraft. In training, friendly aircraft can down each other by flying too close.\n\nA US Navy statement on the incident called the Russian jet's behavior \"unsafe.\"\n\n\"This interaction was determined to be unsafe due to the SU-27 conducting a high speed pass directly in front of the mission aircraft, which put our pilots and crew at risk,\" the Navy said in a Monday statement. \"The intercepting SU-27 made an additional pass, closing with the EP-3 and applying its afterburner while conducting a banking turn away. The crew of the EP-3 reported turbulence following the first interaction, and vibrations from the second. The duration of the intercept was approximately 25 minutes.\"\n\nThe Su-27 then made an additional pass where it got in front of the Navy plane and turned on its afterburners, or ignited the gasses coming off the jet engines for extra thrust.\n\nThe Su-27 wouldn't need to go all out with afterburners to pass the propeller-driven EP-3, but the burners would likely exacerbate turbulence felt by the Navy crew. The Navy said the intercept lasted for 25 minutes.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson told Business Insider Russia made \"no radio contact,\" breaking a norm for air-to-air intercepts that typically get resolved verbally.\n\nThese type of actions \"put our aircrews in danger,\" and \"there is no reason for this behavior,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\nThough the US has announced its Trident Juncture military exercises in international airspace and waters, or over friendly countries with their approval, Russia's military has made a number of \"surprise visits,\" most recently with a long-range bomber flying over a US warship.\n\nThe EP-3 is a electronic warfare and surveillance plane used by the US Navy. Russia's Su-27 handles both air-to-air combat and serves in a bomber role.\n\nHere's the video of the Su-27's dangerous afterburner pass:", "NBC is pulling an ad it aired over the weekend from its networks following a backlash.\n\nThe 30-second ad, approved by President Donald Trump, aired during the \"Sunday Night Football\" game between the New England Patriots and the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\"After further review we recognize the insensitive nature of the ad and have decided to cease airing it across our properties as soon as possible,\" an NBC spokesman told Business Insider.\n\nFox News has also pulled the ad. \"Upon further review, Fox News pulled the ad yesterday and it will not appear on either Fox News Channel or Fox Business Network,\" Marianne Gambelli, the president of Fox's ad sales, said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nCNN previously deemed the ad too racist to air, issuing a statement on Twitter on Saturday: \"CNN has made it abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist. When presented with an opportunity to be paid to take a version of this ad, we declined. Those are the facts.\"\n\nThe primetime ad attempted to draw a connection between Luis Bracamontes, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who was convicted of killing two Sacramento deputies in 2014, and the so-called migrant caravan now traveling up through Mexico toward the US border. There is no known connection.\n\nBesides \"Sunday Night Football,\" the ad also aired on MSNBC, Fox News, and Fox Business, according to the analyst Rich Greenfield, who cited figures from iSpot.tv. MSNBC aired the ad three times, Fox News ran it six times, and Fox Business ran it eight times, according to Greenfield.\n\nNBC quickly drew the ire of some in Hollywood who noted the difference in NBC's and CNN's treatment of the ad.\n\n\"So @nbc and @Comcast aired that racist Trump caravan commercial during the football game,\" the director Judd Apatow tweeted on Sunday night. \"Who made that decision? How did they decide it was ok? I am disgusted that you would air that after @cnn refused to air it because it is explicitly racist. Shame on you. @NBCNews.\"\n\nThe actress Debra Messing, who is starring in NBC's revival of \"Will and Grace,\" also condemned the ad in a tweet, saying to fans of the show: \"I want you to know that I am ashamed that my network aired this disgusting racist ad. It is the antithesis of everything I personally believe in, and what, I believe, our show is all about.\"\n\nA 53-second version of the ad was released on Trump's Twitter account last week accompanied with the words \"It is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country.

China describes the H-20 as a \"new long-distance strategic bomber,\" which recent imagery suggests will take a stealthy delta-wing design.\n\nAn Asia Times profile of the H-20 cited Chinese media as saying \"the ultimate goal for the H-20\" is an \"operational range to 12,000 kilometers with 20 tons of payload.\"\n\n\"A large flying wing design ... is one of the only aerodynamic ways of achieving the broadband all-aspect stealth required for such a design,\" Justin Bronk, an aerial combat expert at the Royal United Services Institute, told Business Insider.\n\nOnly one nation on earth operates a large stealth bomber, and that's the US. But the B-2 has never launched a nuclear bomb, instead it's been used as a stealthy bomb truck that can devastate hardened enemy targets with massive payloads on a nearly invisible platform.\n\nAccording to Lawrence Trevethan, a researcher at the China Aerospace Studies Institute, which works with the US Air Force, that's what China's H-20 will likely do as well.\n\n\"I see the H-20 as a nearly exact replacement for the H-6 (China's current theoretically nuclear-capable bomber),\" Trevethan told Business Insider.\n\nIgnore the nuclear mission\n\nMilitary vehicles carrying DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles travel past Tiananmen Gate. REUTERS/Andy Wong/Pool\n\nTrevethan, an expert on China's nuclear posture, pointed out that the H-6 never trains with nuclear bombs. China's nuclear-missile capable submarines have never had a verified nuclear deterrence patrol. China's nuclear weapons are not kept mated atop missiles, unlike Russia and the US.\n\nAnd there's a simple reason why, according to Trevethan: Nuclear weapons are expensive and mutual nuclear war has never happened.\n\nInstead, conventional war happens \u2014 and happens all the time.\n\nTrevethan called the H-20 a bomber \"that might actually contribute to a military victory in a war fought as its [nuclear] doctrine imagines. \"\n\nBronk agreed, saying the \"biggest impact of a B-2 style capability for the PLAAF [China's air force] would be much greater vulnerability of bases such as Guam and Kadana to conventional precision strikes.\"\n\nCurrently, the US has Aegis and THAAD missile defenses in Guam and its Japanese bases, which pose a threat to China's fleet of missiles. But the US has no established defense against a stealth bomber, which China will likely seek to exploit with the H-20.\n\nNot built for cold wars\n\nThroughout the 1960s, US B-52 nuclear-capable bombers stayed airborne and ready to launch nearly around the clock. USAF\n\nInstead of a simple air-based nuclear deterrent, like the US and Russia maintain, spend tons of money on, and hope to never use, China's H-20 looks more like a bomber that actually plans to fight wars. (The US' bomber fleet, both nuclear and non-nuclear, fights in wars, but never in a nuclear capacity.)\n\nChina's defensive nuclear posture also allows it more leeway in a shooting war. If the US and Russia got into a battle, and either side saw ballistic missiles heading for the other, it would have to assume they were nuclear missiles and retaliate before it faced utter destruction.\n\nBut with no missiles ready to go and a much smaller stockpile, China can fire missiles at US bases and ships without giving the impression of a full-on nuclear doomsday.\n\nBy fitting the H-20's concept into China's nuclear posture, it comes across as more of a credible conventional strike platform meant to beat the US back in the Pacific rather than a flying nuclear threat.", "Sprite's newest ad campaign is less a commercial than a public service announcement to vote.\n\nThe campaign, called \"Get Vocal,\" encourages people to record and upload a video of themselves freestyling about an issue they care about.

Latelle starts with \"We got a president who always lies to us.\"\n\nIt's the kind of work that a few years ago may have been deemed too risky for brands to weigh in on. But as they increasingly wade into political issues, brands like Sprite and others are hoping to connect with younger consumers.\n\nBehind the scenes of the campaign is Attn:, a digital publisher that has used its roots in civic engagement and its massive audience of these younger consumers to crank out a handful of voting- and cause-related campaigns for brands leading up to the midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\nRead more: Here's how startup Attn: averages a whopping 3.8 million views per video on Facebook\n\n\"Being apolitical or non-issue-driven is no longer an option with millennial and Gen Z consumers,\" Attn: CEO Matthew Segal told Business Insider. \"Brands now know that they need to take a position or stand for something \u2014 or at the very least stand for civic engagement in the year 2018.\"\n\nBrands are pushing people to the polls\n\nSeveral brands have dived into hot-button issues over the past few years, and some have been more successful (like Nike and Patagonia) than others (like Starbucks and Pepsi).\n\nNike's Colin Kaepernick ad.

Before founding the company, Segal ran the voter-empowerment organization Our Time.\n\nFor IBM, Attn: created a two-minute Facebook clip titled \"Why Your Vote May Be at Risk This November\" to explain misinformation and voting schemes.\n\nAnd for Freeform, the two media companies used their talent to create a series of PSAs, airing on TV and social media, that focus on the statistic that the average voter waited in line for 11 minutes to vote in the 2016 presidential election, comparing it with the amount of time people spend on things like scrolling through Instagram.\n\nAttn: is making white-label content for brands\n\nThe Freeform and IBM campaigns use Attn:'s audience for distribution.\n\nBut the Sprite campaign is a bit different. Attn:'s logo isn't splashed on the videos, nor is it distributed across the publisher's network of social platforms. It's an example of white-label work that the publisher is taking on for brands and is based on insights instead of reliant on its audience.\n\n\"A lot of our partners obviously want our audience and distribution, but I think we have a lot of value to add that can certainly rival some ad agencies, so to speak,\" Segal said. \"I think brands not only know that we know how to produce spots for social media, but also know that we have a finger on the pulse on how young people feel and how to best make these topics digestible.\"\n\nTaryn Crouthers, the head of brand partnerships at Attn:, said that about half of the company's work with brands on corporate-social-responsibility campaigns came from brainstorming together, as opposed to issuing requests for proposals.\n\n\"Brands are coming to Attn: because they value the fact that we understand how to talk and speak about these complex issues in a way that's both entertaining but also informative,\" she said.\n\nAttn: is also paying to make its own voting-themed editorial content, including videos with former President Barack Obama and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.", "New York City's One World Trade Center welcomed its first tenants in 2014\u2014 but they weren't necessarily the tenants that were expected.\n\nJordan Barowitz, Vice President of Public Affairs for the Durst Organization, which oversees leasing in the building, said when they first started marketing the building's office spaces in 2010, they had a very different idea of who their tenants were going to be.\n\n\"We thought that the building, with its prestigious address and the level of its architecture and design, would be like this prestige icon where global Fortune 500 companies would want to have their New York or their US offices,\" he told Business Insider. \"We thought it was going to be a really sort of formal office building.\"\n\nInstead, One World Trade Center found itself with a different tenant base. \"It's not guys in suits strolling the corridors, but people that look like this dude,\" Barowitz said jokingly, gesturing at a man passing by at that moment wearing black jeans, sneakers, a long-sleeved tee, and a backpack.\n\nWhile I did see some \"guys in suits\" here and there, the majority of people I noticed passing through the lobby and working in the building's employee caf\u00e9 were dressed in much more casual styles. Beards and sneakers were abundant.\n\n\"It's not these well-established companies; it's technology and media and creative firms,\" Barowitz said. \"It's a lot of smaller tenants. They're not startups, they're like 2.0 businesses who have graduated from the garage to the office space in Soho or Tribeca, and now they need more space and they need a Class A building that operates efficiently.\"\n\nA One World Trade Center employee enters the building. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nThe unexpected occupants are largely a result of those industries seeing the most growth in the market in recent years, according to Barowitz. Some of One World Trade Center's current tenants include media company Cond\u00e9 Nast, marketing startup BounceX, sports media company and streaming service DAZN, Inc. Magazine, and workout app Aaptiv.\n\n\"One WTC is becoming the building for companies in the tech and media world and we look forward to having them be part of the exciting community at the building,\" David Falk, president of the New York tri-state region of Newmark Knight Frank, said in a news release announcing DAZN's lease signing.\n\nDespite the abundance of tech and media companies, One World Trade Center is also home to commercial real estate company Cushman & Wakefield, investment research company Morningstar, and Ameriprise Financial, a Fortune 500 company.\n\nOne World Trade Center has a creative vibe \u2014 in an easy location\n\nOne big reason these smaller-scale and more creative tenants are attracted to the building is because it's more modern and efficient than some of the Soho and Tribeca loft buildings they might've occupied before, Barowitz said. All the elevators work, there are a lot of them so you don't have to wait too long, and the air conditioning works on the weekends.\n\nOne WTC's tenants tend to be technology, media, and creative firms, in addition to Fortune 500 companies. Katie Warren/Business Insider\n\nAnother big draw is the building's location. Lower Manhattan has become more attractive for employers because the creative class has moved to Brooklyn and North Jersey, according to Barowitz.\n\n\"So if Cond\u00e9 Nast takes a look at who their employees are, they're not coming on the train from Westchester,\" he said. \"They're coming on the subway from Fort Greene. So Lower Manhattan is much more convenient for their employees, especially if you live in North Jersey and Hoboken.\"\n\nTraveling from Hoboken to One World Trade Center on the PATH train can take as little as 14 minutes, according to Google Maps.\n\n\"Also, buildings get vibes,\" Barowitz said. \"And this building has gotten the vibe of this is where these creative companies are.\"", "The search for Amazon's second headquarters just got more complicated.\n\nAmazon is in late-stage talks with multiple cities, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. It appears Amazon is chatting it up with officials in Crystal City, Virginia; Dallas, Texas; and New York City.\n\nThe Journal's report cautions that the discussions are likely in different stages with each city, and that the multiple conversations may be happening so that Amazon would have a backup plan in case one falls through.\n\nBut the Journal also reports that Amazon could announce smaller operations in cities that are not ultimately chosen for HQ2, much like a second- or third-place prize.\n\nAmazon already has a nationwide operation, so it makes sense that it would want to expand in more than one city. Plus, Amazon might get more favorable terms from cities and states who would find the large tax breaks an easier sell to constituents when packaged with HQ2 luster.\n\nAn Amazon representative did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment on the report.\n\nThe window for Amazon to name the location for HQ2 is closing fast.\n\nThe company has less than two months left to announce its decision for where it will invest $5 billion and add some 50,000 jobs for the HQ2 project.

These credits are earned by Tesla outside the Zero Emissions Vehicle regime that's followed by California and nine other states. But like ZEV credits, Tesla can sell them at any time, and automakers who don't produce enough vehicles to meet regulatory requirements have to buy them.\n\nTesla bear Colin Langan at UBS \u2014 he has a $190 price target and a \"sell\" rating on the stock \u2014 called out the non-ZEV sale in a note published Monday. If this sounds vaguely familiar, it's because Tesla was also called out for ZEV sales in 2016. And in truth, the non-ZEV credits aided the company's bottom line in Q3 2018.\n\nRead more:Tesla is getting slammed for doing something that it would be stupid to avoid\n\nThe argument, then, is that Tesla can't really post steady profits without some \"unexpected help,\" as Langan wrote.\n\nTesla has also been a little cagey about revealing its non-ZEV sales, but that's neither here nor there because everybody knows that the company's greatly increased sales volumes will mean a tsunami of credits.\n\nA bonus for selling only electric cars\n\nThe problem here is that because Tesla sells only electric vehicles, it racks up a massive number of ZEV and non-ZEV credits. They are, in a sense, a bonus payment for Tesla's shouldering the risk of being the only all-electric carmaker in the US.\n\nTesla can also sell these credits whenever it wants. Consequently, they should be thought of as the opposite of unexpected. As long as they're around, Tesla can tap them as a revenue stream.\n\n\"The help from other EV credits in Q3 highlights that underlying operations were not as strong as the original release implied, and increases our confidence that Q4 results will decline despite higher volumes,\" Langan wrote.\n\nFine, but even taking out credit sales, Tesla still posted a $0.55-per-share profit, according to UBS's analysis. So even if Q4 comes in around that level, Musk never said Tesla would vaporize profits in the second half of 2018 \u2014 he just said that Tesla would stop losing money.\n\nIf you're looking for a counter to the argument that Tesla lives and dies by ZEV and non-ZEV credits, look no farther than the huge implicit subsidy the federal gas tax represents for traditional automakers, who have been printing money for three years as sales of large pickups and SUVs have boomed. It's currently just north of $0.18 per gallon for gasoline \u2014 and hasn't been raised since 1993.", "Would you be more likely to vote if Election Day were a national holiday? Getty / Joe Raedle\n\nElection Day isn't a national holiday in the US, but some people think it should be.\n\nWhile the majority of US states have voter leave laws that guarantee certain employees a modicum of time off to vote, no federal law currently mandates that employees get time off to cast their ballots.\n\nSo when faced with choices like having to take unpaid time off work to vote, waking at the wee hours of the morning to vote so that they're not late to work, standing in hours-long lines with everyone else who waited until after the workday to cast their ballot, or simply not voting at all, many choose the latter.\n\nOf the nonvoters surveyed by the US Census Bureau about the 2008 presidential election, the 2012 presidential election, and numerous other elections, the most commonly cited reason for not voting was being too busy or having conflicting work schedules.\n\nRead more:You can take time off from work to vote in 30 states \u2014 here's the full list\n\nAccording to Pew Research data, US voter turnout trails most developed countries.

But in many other countries, the government automatically registers voters and holds elections on days that are weekend days or national holidays. Do you think it's time for the US to follow their lead?\"\n\nObama: \"Absolutely. We are the only advanced democracy that makes it deliberately difficult for people to vote.\"\n\nOthers, however, are skeptical that creating a national holiday would increase voter turnout. As Osita Nwanevu wrote for Slate, \"Low turnout is a complicated problem, and some of the more obvious-seeming remedies haven't really worked...

One of the risks of this proposal is that people will interpret it very superficially as rewarding, or giving people who put more education or more wealth, a bigger weight in the voting process and that is absolutely incorrect. The most important thing I believe for democracy to function is two things.\n\nOne is to make sure that as many people as possible are voting, and so in that context, one of the concerns is low-voter participation rates. In the United States, they are now around 50%. For low-income households, they are around 30%. But the second thing that's critically important is that voters have an understanding of the political process. One of the big issues that has been revealed is that we're seeing a lot of disaffection and people tend to vote for candidates based on things as basic as what color pantsuit they're wearing. And that I think really undermines the political process.\n\nDiscussing what sorts of factors would help us understand who should be voting and how voters should be voting, I believe that having a civics program where people really understand how the government functions and who they're voting for and what those people stand for. At the very bare minimum, a civics test, and I draw really on my experience as an immigrant, would really tap into the historical context of how exactly the United States political system was established, but more specifically, it will talk about how it's structured today.\n\nFor example, just a basic understanding of what the different arms of government are and how the political process works from the role of superdelegate and delegate, but it's also about how primaries work and how the whole process of the caucusing and the electoral college works in a democratic system. And I think that, at a very bare minimum, would help voters understand what the role of their vote is and how that action would impact, not just on the election process, but also long-term economic policy.\n\nBecause I'm an eternal optimist, and because we have a history where people of color were not allowed to vote, women were not allowed to vote, I imagine that there were times when there was pause and people thought, well we really can't have a system where women voted or where minorities voted, but here we are today in a world where it is possible. And so on that basis, I don't see why we shouldn't be optimistic about reforms and innovation to the democratic process that can make it stronger and perform better.\n\nWe want to make sure that people do have access to information about the candidates that they're fielding but also make sure that they have understanding about the basic political and policy issues that are up for debate.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published on May 30, 2018.", "Michael Ellison, CEO of the nonprofit Codepath.org, recently posted on LinkedIn about an experience he had 14 years ago that launched his career.\n\nTo make a long story short, Ellison cold called his way into a Goldman Sachs conference, then ended up speaking at that conference the following year.\n\nWe called Ellison, now 33, to get the full details, and he told us that he and his cofounder hardly had a plan when they started dialing random phone extensions at Goldman Sachs.\n\nEllison and his cofounder decided to cold call Goldman Sachs and ask for funding\n\nAt the time, Ellison's nonprofit, BASE, was about three months old. Ellison and his cofounder, Lori-Anne Ramsay, had come to one glaring realization: They couldn't get anything done without money.\n\nRead more:The CEO of a startup that's raised $20 million gives the same piece of advice to every new entrepreneur he meets\n\nIt was 2004, and BASE was designed to help students in low-income communities around Boston, where dropout rates were high. When it came to funding, BASE's founders didn't have much.\n\n\"We were more than naive,\" Ellison told Business Insider. They asked each other: \"Who has money?\" (And might be willing to share some?)\n\nOne of them suggested Goldman Sachs. \"We'd heard stories about executives [there] getting huge sums of money,\" Ellison said.\n\nEllison and Ramsay decided to dial any numbers they could find on the Goldman Sachs website. Every single person that answered hung up on them.\n\nEventually, someone answered and suggested that perhaps they were calling about an upcoming conference Goldman Sachs was sponsoring, \"Pipeline Crisis Winning Strategies.\"\n\nEllison and Ramsay had no idea what she was talking about, but they went along with it and ended up receiving tickets to the conference.\n\n'You could feel how much money was in the room'\n\nA few weeks later, they boarded a $10 bus from Boston to New York City, Ellison wearing an ill-fitting suit he'd borrowed from his roommate.\n\nAs soon as they arrived at the conference, Ellison said, they knew they looked out of place: Everyone there was at least 40 years old and established in their careers. \"You could feel how much money was in the room,\" Ellison said.\n\nUndeterred, Ellison and Ramsay started going up to people and pitching BASE: \"Hey, so I'm working with this nonprofit that I founded\u2026\" Most people were dismissive.\n\nThey might have been out of luck had they not crashed one of the conference panels. Ramsay asked a question about the root causes of the dropout trend that stumped the panelists.\n\nMultiple people came up to Ellison and Ramsay afterward to meet the precocious youth who'd asked the question. Some were lawyers at a top New York City firm, and one worked at the Goldman Sachs Foundation.\n\nThe following year, Ellison's cofounder spoke at the conference\n\nThe founders arranged meetings with some of the executives who'd approached them, and continued to send them regular progress updates. They would even work their political capital, offering to connect one executive they'd spoken to with others they'd met.\n\nWithin months, they'd been appointed to the committee that planned the Pipeline Crisis Winning Strategies conference. Ramsay even earned a spot on one of the panels.\n\nGoldman Sachs was shocked to see Ellison and Ramsay again. \"How are you here?\" Ellison remembered one executive asking.\n\nCold contacting a successful person can (sometimes) be a winning strategy\n\nWhile Ellison and Ramsay may have used an extreme strategy to build their business, they're hardly the only people to cold call or cold message their way to success.\n\nFor example, Elliot Bell sent Kathryn Minshew, CEO of The Muse, a cold LinkedIn message after he saw her speak at a conference. Bell ended up getting hired as the head of marketing at The Muse (even though they hadn't been looking to fill that role).\n\nMeanwhile, Liz Wessel, CEO of WayUp, has all her employees cold email their idols. Wessel herself emailed her biggest role model asking for 15 minutes of her time, and the woman invited her to come to dinner at her house the next night.\n\nWessel's advice for cold emailing is rather different from the technique Ellison and Ramsay used. Her specific pointers include: Make the message personal and identify one small thing you'd like to get out of the meeting.\n\n'I'm scared to death, but I'm jumping in anyway'\n\nBASE is no longer in operation. Ellison said it fell apart during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nSince then, Ellison has launched a number of organizations, including the Y Combinator-backed Class Metric, which aimed to increase student engagement and comprehension. CodePath.org, where Ellison is currently CEO, is geared toward boosting the number of high-performing, underrepresented software engineers in the tech industry.\n\nBack in the BASE days, Ellison said he didn't have a particular strategy when he set out cold calling, or pitching, or meeting with executives.\n\n\"Growing up, I was very introverted and self-conscious,\" he said. \"It took years for me to embrace the uncomfortable.\" Even today, his overall life philosophy is to do almost anything that makes him squirm, even if he's terrified while doing it.\n\nEllison called it a \"theme\" in his life, noting that he's rarely fearless. \"I'm scared to death, but I'm jumping in anyway.\"", "At first glance, you might miss it. But among Central Park's usual waterfowl crowd, there appears to be a new addition. And people are flocking to see him.\n\nA single, male Mandarin duck flaunts his multi-colored feathers as he swims out among a posse of mallards and wood ducks. He's not a local, and it's a mystery as to how he arrived. The theory that he escaped from a zoo or sanctuary has been ruled out so far. And since ducks aren't allowed as pets in New York City, that theory also stands on shaky ground.\n\nThe duck was first spotted about a month ago by birdwatchers who frequent the park, but he fell off the grid for two weeks and reappeared a week or so ago. Since then, he's been traversing different bodies of water throughout the park. The twitter account Manhattan Bird Alert tweets out the location of the duck from time to time.\n\nHuge crowds from all over New York City, of all ages, have turned up in the past weekend to see the duck. The Mandarin duck's favorite hang-out spot, the pond by 59th street and 5th avenue, drew a crowd that lined the entire perimeter of the waterfront on Saturday. Spectators wait patiently, with cameras, binoculars, and scopes for the duck to leave his asylum on a shaded rock island that sits at the visually obscured part of the pond-where he preens his resplendent coat-and swim out to greet his fans.\n\nThe duck has become Twitter famous as well, ever since The New York Times published an article that drew in a flurry of shares all over social media.\n\nI went to see him this weekend, and he was truly spectacular. His stark and striking plumage consists of brilliant orange, white, blue, and violet.\n\nCharlotte Hu / Business Insider\n\nThe Mandarin duck is native to east Asia \u2014 found in China, Korea, Japan, and parts of Russia. It's a migratory bird that weighs around 600 grams, or a little more than a pound. It's slightly smaller and lighter than the standard mallard. Mandarin ducks tend to be a bit introverted by nature, according The Wildlife Trusts, and like to hide behind overhanging willows. They eat water plants, rice, grains, pests, and some small fish and mollusks, and live for about 6 years.\n\nCharlotte Hu / Business Insider\n\nMandarin ducks prefer wooded freshwater ponds or marshes. That's due to a quirk these ducks have - they like to nest in holes high up in trees. After the ducklings hatch, the mother duck coaxes them to jump down from the nest. They share this trait with the wood duck, a close relative.\n\nMale and female Mandarin ducks share an elaborate courtship ritual before forming monogamous pairs at the beginning of winter. Because of this, Mandarin ducks in China are a symbol of love and healthy relationships.\n\nThe Central Park Mandarin duck, however, still seems to be living out his bachelor days leisuring by the pond-side and bathing in attention.\n\nIn the wake of his growing celebrity, the New York City Parks Twitter account tweeted a request to visitors, asking them to \"please remember to enjoy our new friend from a distance and do not feed him.\"", "President Donald Trump said he hasn't seen his own government's National Climate Assessment, but he doubts its grim conclusions and thinks the climate can change back on its own.\n\nShown the National Climate Assessment, a document his administration produced, during his appearance on HBO's \"Axios,\" Trump disputed its findings and said he thinks the climate changes back and forth.\n\nThe document concludes that it's \"extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\"\n\nFurther, it links climate change to forest fires that have ravaged the US in recent years as well as rising water levels that threaten a broad swath of coastal US cities.

Yeah,\" said Trump to Axios.\n\n\"Will it go back like this?\" Trump asked, making an up and down waving motion with his hand. \"I mean will it change back? Probably, that's what I think.\"\n\n\"I believe it goes this way,\" he said, again waving his hand up and down.\n\n\"We do have an impact, but I don't believe the impact is nearly what some scientists say, and other scientists dispute those findings very strongly,\" Trump said.\n\nThe real science\n\nNASA\n\nRecent scientific journals have not disputed human-caused climate change, so it's unclear what scientific reports Trump was referring to.\n\nSome scientists disagree about the extent to which the climate has changed, but they are in consensus that humans are exacerbating the change.\n\nTrump has championed policies, like the use of coal for power, that scientists blame for releasing carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. In defense of his preference for coal, Trump has said he doesn't want to combat climate change at the expense of US jobs.\n\nThese were some of the reasons why Trump pulled the US out of the global Paris agreement to combat climate change in 2017.\n\nWhile Trump correctly stated that the Earth's climate changes regularly over time, it does so on a geologic time scale, rather than in a matter of generations.

Such a short span of time between a film's review embargo and its release is usually a sign of trouble, and this was: Critics tore into the movie, which ultimately scored a 27% critical rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nSony couldn't afford another misfire after \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" failed to generate excitement in 2014. If \"Venom\" bombed, it probably would have spelled defeat for its \"Spider-Man\" universe going forward. (It's still Sony's biggest cinematic property.)\n\n\"If it had failed, there is a chance Sony would have definitely returned to the bargaining table with Disney,\" Jeff Bock, a senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations, told Business Insider. \"Now, that's up in the air.\"\n\nFortunately for Sony, \"Venom\" is a hit.\n\nThe movie, which stars Tom Hardy, has brought in over $500 million worldwide with a $100 million production budget. It has an 87% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes from 32,000 ratings, and a B+ from Cinemascore. It broke the box-office record for an October opening weekend, with $80 million, after estimates put it in the range of $65 million to $75 million.\n\nThe success of \"Venom\" means Sony's \"Spider-Man\" cinematic universe, which once looked as if it were on life support, is here to stay.\n\n\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2.\" Courtesy Columbia Pictures\n\nSony strikes a deal with Marvel Studios\n\nIn 2015, Sony made a deal with Marvel Studios in which Spider-Man could be introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while Sony maintained distribution rights and creative control. It meant Sony could still make movies based on the 900 Marvel Spider-Man characters it owns the film rights to, while Marvel and its parent company, Disney, could use the character in its film universe.\n\nThe deal came after Sony's \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\" the sequel to its 2012 reboot, floundered at the box office. It raked in just over $200 million in the US, barely more than its production budget, after opening to a disappointing $91 million. Most of its money came from the international box office, which isn't new for a blockbuster, though it wasn't enough to fulfill Sony's grander \"Spider-Man\" vision to compete with Marvel after \"The Avengers\" made $1.5 billion worldwide two years before.\n\n\"Everyone had high hopes for this,\" a production assistant on \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\" who wished to remain anonymous to protect future business relationships, told Business Insider. \"They were projecting for it to at least make more money than the first one.\"\n\n\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" made less domestically and globally than its predecessor. Then came the Sony hack in November 2014, in which WikiLeaks released a massive trove of private Sony emails, data, and files. Internal communications about \"reinvigorating\" the \"Spider-Man\" franchise and potentially having Marvel Studios produce were revealed.\n\nIt all forced Sony to reevaluate its planned Spider-verse, which would have included a \"Sinister Six\" villain-centric spin-off that \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\" attempted to set up. Instead, Sony worked with Marvel Studios to deliver MCU's \"Spider-Man: Homecoming,\" starring Tom Holland, last year; it was a hit.\n\n\"Sony just wants to make a buck, and they don't mind throwing s--- at the wall to make a buck,\" the former production assistant said.\n\n\"Venom.\" Sony\n\n'Venom' helps Sony rebound\n\nIf you asked critics, \"Venom\" was another case of \"throwing s--- at the wall.\" But audiences have thought differently, and box-office experts agree that the movie's success is no accident.\n\nSony \"took a calculated risk with 'Venom,' and it's now going to be a series,\" Bock said. \"It seems Disney needs Sony's 'Spider-Man' more than Sony needs Disney ... If they consistently make films audiences want to see, Disney will have to buy Sony to get 'Spider-Man' back.\"\n\n\"A half-billion dollars in revenue for 'Venom' worldwide proves that this is no fluke, and despite a critical drubbing, the film has found great favor with audiences who are fully vested in the 'Spider-Man' brand as well as their embracing of Tom Hardy,\" the comScore senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian told Business Insider.\n\nWhat's next for Sony's \"Spider-Man\" plans?\n\nThe animated \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" hits theaters this December. The \"Homecoming\" follow-up with Marvel Studios, \"Spider-Man: Far From Home,\" comes to theaters in July.\n\nApart from the MCU, Sony is developing multiple spin-offs like \"Venom,\" including one starring Jared Leto as the vampire Morbius, and one featuring Black Cat, a frequent Spider-Man love interest. There's even the possibility that Spider-Man himself could show up, though it remains to be seen whether it would be Tom Holland's MCU version or someone else.\n\nOh, and a \"Venom\" sequel is highly likely.\n\n\"There is strong interest in a sequel, which will no doubt happen given its success,\" Box Office Analyst's Doug Stone said.\n\nRead more: What you need to know about the 'Spider-Man' villain who appears in the 'Venom' after-credits scene\n\nOf course, there is the possibility that Sony doesn't ride this momentum and its \"Amazing Spider-Man 2\" problems happen all over again.\n\nKen Miyamoto, a former Sony story analyst and script reader in the 2000s who is now an industry blogger for ScreenCraft, told Business Insider that Sony would \"clearly fast-track these titles in hopes of replicating the box-office success of 'Venom.'\"\n\n\"And I just don't see it working with those characters,\" Miyamoto said. \"Nobody cares.\"\n\nHe added: \"If you push things too fast to try and emulate the MCU to create connected multi-franchises, you're going to suffer the same fate you did before.\"\n\nBut for now, the success of \"Venom\" and the likely success of \"Into the Spider-Verse\" next month have positioned Sony well and changed its balance of power with Disney. Beyond \"Spider-Man,\" Sony is developing \"Bloodshot,\" a film it hopes to turn into another comic-book-based cinematic universe, starring Vin Diesel and produced by the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise producer Neal Moritz.\n\n\"This is just the beginning of Sony's reemergence as a studio of box-office distinction,\" Bock said. \"They're not giving it up without a fight.\"\n\nIf you have insight into the success of \"Venom\" and Sony's \"Spider-Man\" plans, email the author at tclark@businessinsider.com.", "Kanye West's favorite restaurant is McDonald's, according to the rapper.

West has been a dedicated Chipotle customer since at least 2007, when he introduced fellow hip-hop artist Big Sean to the chain.\n\nWest has also name-dropped Ruby Tuesdays, Fridays, and a Burger King slogan\u2014 all in a single line.\n\n\"Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays, If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way,\" he rapped in his 2005 track \"Gone,\" notes Genius.\n\nAppreciation for fast food also runs in West's family.\n\nWest's father, Ray West, founded the Good Water Store and Cafe in Lexington Park, Maryland, in 2006.

They've relied on it as the primary driver of stock gains throughout the nearly 10-year bull market, and old habits die hard.\n\nSure, companies in the S&P 500 are on pace to grow profits at a more than 20% clip, which is still above the bull market average. But it's the overall trend that has some experts worried.\n\nGoldman Sachs is specifically focused on three forces it says are putting serious pressure on profit margins: (1) increased tariffs, (2) a tight labor market featuring low unemployment and accelerating wage growth, and (3) rising debt costs \u2014 which are largely due to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.\n\nGoldman has been paying close attention to corporate earnings calls, and those are the three headwinds that keep popping up.\n\nAs such, investors are no longer rewarding companies that beat near-term profit forecasts. They're instead more worried about what the future holds, and how the inevitable worsening of those three factors will play out in the market.\n\nThis chart shows the recent worsening of corporate margins pressures as the labor market has tightened. As costs have risen, firms have largely been unable to offset that with price hikes \u2014 at least up to this point.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nThose type of conditions are a recipe for disaster for traders \u2014 especially those who have relied so heavily on earnings growth for the majority of the bull market.\n\nBut Goldman says it doesn't have to be such a solemn time for investors. They just have to recognize that the investing landscape has changed, and adjust their approach accordingly.\n\nIn this case, that means identifying and loading up on shares of companies who are less exposed to margin pressures. Goldman highlights two subsets in particular: (1) firms with strong balance sheets (as in, those not saddled by exorbitant debt) and (2) companies with strong price power.\n\nBoth areas outperformed during Red October, or the turbulent period for stocks that saw major US indexes slip into correction territory. Since much of the market's trepidation stemmed from a cloudy labor market outlook, the relative resilience of these types of companies was an encouraging sign.\n\n\"Tariffs, wage inflation, and rising interest rates pose three key risks to all-time high S&P 500 profit margins,\" David Kostin, Goldman's chief US equity strategist, wrote in a client note. \"We recommend investors continue to focus on firms with demonstrated ability to maintain high margins.\"", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

This marks an acceleration in growth compared with Q4 2017, when revenue grew just 12% YoY.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\niPhone revenue accelerated, aided by the product's increased average selling price (ASP) compared with a year earlier. The number of iPhones shipped remained relatively flat YoY, while iPhone's ASP grew 28% to $793 from $618 a year ago. In turn, Apple's iPhone revenue jumped 29% YoY and accounted for 59% of total revenue in Q4, compared with its 2% revenue growth and 55% revenue share in Q4 2017.\n\nAlthough the iPhone was the biggest contributor to overall revenue, the company also highlighted record numbers from its Services and Other Products segments.\n\nThe Services segment experienced its best quarter ever. Services \u2014 including the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music, and Apple Pay \u2014 reached $10 billion in revenue in Q4, up 17% YoY, marking a slight deceleration from 34% YoY growth last year. The company attributed its success, among other factors, to the growth of app subscriptions, which the company has been urging developers to offer over paid apps since subscriptions bring in more recurring revenue \u2014 The App Store now has over 330 million paid subscriptions, up 50% YoY, according to Apple CFO Luca Maestri.\n\nOther Products reached record numbers for Q4. Other Products, which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, HomePod, and other Apple-branded accessories, hit $4.2 billion in revenue, up 31% YoY, which is a slight dip in growth from 37% in Q4 2017. The growth was attributed to the strong performances of Apple TV as well as HomePod, the latter of which the company released in February 2018.", "Lowe's is closing dozens of stores throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nThe company said in a statement on Monday that in the US it would close 20 Lowe's stores across 13 states and that most associates at the affected stores \"will be extended opportunities to transition to a similar role at a nearby Lowe's store.\"\n\nBut the closures aren't just happening in the US.\n\nIt will also close 31 locations in five Canadian provinces, including two Lowe's stores; 24 Rona stores, a Canadian retailer Lowe's acquired in 2016; one Reno-Depot, a Canadian home-supply store that Rona acquired in 2003; two offices in Mississauga, Ontario, and St. John's, Newfoundland; and two specialty facilities.\n\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that workers at stores in Newfoundland were blindsided by the news, as were representatives of the Atlantic Canada Regional Council of Carpenters, Millwrights and Allied Workers, a union that represents numerous Rona employees.\n\nA union representative told the CBC that 250 members were set to lose their jobs and that employees were called into a meeting and handed severance letters on Sunday.\n\nRead more: Home Depot, Lowe's, Tesla, and Wegmans top the list of most-liked companies \u2014 employees explain why they have such a cult following\n\nIn its statement, Lowe's described the stores as \"underperforming\" and said the closures were designed to \"improve the overall health of its store portfolio.\" The stores are set to close by February 1, though some US stores are closing immediately.\n\n\"While decisions that impact our associates are never easy, the store closures are a necessary step in our strategic reassessment as we focus on building a stronger business,\" Marvin Ellison, Lowe's president and CEO, said in the statement.\n\nHere's the list of closing stores:\n\nLowe's\n\n1100 Bankhead Highway SW, Graysville, Alabama\n\n26501 Aliso Creek Road, Aliso Viejo, California\n\n13300 Jamboree Road, Irvine, California\n\n720 Dubuque Ave., South San Francisco, California\n\n750 Newhall Drive, San Jose, California\n\n48 Boston Post Road, Orange, Connecticut\n\n1333 Schaefer Road, Granite City, Illinois\n\n7735 Grand Ave., Gurnee, Illinois\n\n6221 US Highway 6, Portage, Indiana\n\n5770 Read Blvd., New Orleans, Louisiana\n\n599 Thomas Burgin Parkway, Quincy, Massachusetts\n\n4274 E.

You can plug as many flash drives or hard drives as you want into the iPad Pro's USB-C port, and nothing will happen. Apple says third parties can write apps to talk to external storage, but out of the box, this $1899 tablet simply won't talk to a flash drive.\"\n\nPatel notes the USB-C port works with \"most normal stuff\" like card readers, Ethernet ports, HDMI, and even 5K external displays. But no dice on storage.\n\nUnlike older forms of USB, the new USB-C port in the iPad Pro allows for the transfer of both power and data. So technically, it should be able to transfer storage to a secondary device. But Apple doesn't seem to want that \u2014 most likely because customers buy the new iPads with specific storage options, ranging from $799 for 64 GB all the way up to $1,549 for 1 terabyte. Apple probably doesn't want people buying the cheapest storage option and augmenting that with a cheap external storage device; it would lose out on a lot of money.\n\nApple\n\nWithout any external storage options for the iPad Pro, your best bet is to either buy plenty of built-in storage, or buy lots of iCloud storage.", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \"Payments Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Digital represented 12% of total C2C revenue in the quarter, and the C2C segment comprised 80% of the firm's overall revenue.\n\nDigital growth has been outpacing overall revenue growth for several quarters. For context, Western Union's overall revenue grew by 3% in Q2 2018, while its digital revenue increased by 21%. And this has been a trend among other players in the space: Competing legacy remittance giant MoneyGram saw its digital revenue grow 17% annually in Q2 2018 while its overall revenue fell by 11%, for example.\n\nBut both players are facing threats from the influx of digital-first remittance players, which are able to undercut their pricing and offer competitive digital services. And all players are targeting the same consumers, making it important for Western Union to continue bolstering its value proposition and differentiate from competitors.\n\nWestern Union should find ways to further engage its users and attract a new audience. Legacy players have the advantage of robust international networks \u2014 Western Union counts more than 200 markets \u2014 where they can continue to focus their efforts.

The study will help Apple explore how its Watch can be used to identify AFib, a common type of irregular heartbeat that heightens the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nAFib costs the US around $6 billion annually, and is responsible for about 130,000 deaths and 750,000 hospitalizations in the US every year, the CDC reports. And AFib detection has been one of Apple's strategic focuses in healthcare thus far \u2014 the tech giant released the Watch Series 4 with an FDA-cleared AFib detection feature in September, for example.\n\nApple and Stanford also published additional details on the study's structure, outlining that certain participants receive an electrocardiogram (EKG) patch, the gold standard in heart rate monitoring. The EKG patch helps researchers evaluate how the Apple Watch's detection of irregular pulse corresponds with medical-grade AFib detection. But study participants can use any Watch dating back to the Series 1. Researchers are also keeping tabs on how many users seek medical care within three months of receiving a notification about their irregular heart rate.\n\nThe Apple Heart Study could strengthen the Watch's existing medical features and bolster Apple's healthcare play. When Apple unveiled its EKG and AFib features earlier this year, some physicians balked at the Watch's ability to stack up against the accuracy of existing monitors, questioning whether Apple might trigger false positives and unnecessarily send a flood of patients to the ER, CNBC notes.\n\nApple could use insights gleaned from the study to refine the Watch's EKG app and AFib detection as well as offer evidence of the Watch's efficacy, which could entrench it as a more valuable tool to medical professionals. The Watch spearheads Apple's aggressive move into healthcare, an approach that's seen success \u2014 Apple Watch shipments grew 38% year-over-year in Q2 2018 to capture 17% of the wearable market, with Xiaomi (15%) and Fitbit (9.5%) trailing behind.

While this is a deceleration from its growth in fiscal Q1 2019, which was 61% YoY, this quarter's performance gives Alibaba six consecutive quarters with core commerce revenue growth over 50% YoY.\n\nAlibaba is looking to tactics like personalization and omnichannel to propel its business in the future.\n\nIt revamped its Taobao app with artificial intelligence (AI) to create a more individualized shopping experience. Alibaba has updated the app's interface so that it's customized to a consumer's shopping behaviors and offers more recommendations. This can help it draw more sales from its users, as the updates boosted consumers' level of engagement and the recommendation section had a higher click-through rate this quarter, CEO Daniel Zhang said on the earnings call.\n\nThe company's New Retail initiative continues to blur the lines of online and in-store shopping at more stores. Alibaba now has 77 high-tech Hema grocery stores and, among those that have been open for a year and a half or longer, more than 60% of sales were online this quarter. Meanwhile, about 350 of Sun Art Retail Group's 470 stores now fulfill online grocery orders through the Taobao app for nearby consumers. This follows Alibaba's $2.88 billion investment in the store operator, and allows it to leverage its e-commerce expertise to capture more sales that would otherwise go through brick-and-mortar.", "The Embraer Phenom 300E and me! Benjamin Zhang/Business Insider\n\nThe Embraer Phenom 300 has been an unqualified success since its debut in 2010. Over the past half-decade, more customers have taken delivery of the Phenom 300 than any other private jet in the world. According to Embraer, it has delivered more than 400 of the planes to customers in roughly 40 countries around the world.\n\nIn October 2017, Embraer unveiled an updated version of the plane called the Phenom 300E at the 2017 National Business Aviation Association conference and exhibition in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nIn case you're wondering, the \"E\" in 300E stands for enhanced. It's in reference to the extra dose of technology and luxury Embraer baked into its new plane.\n\nThe Phenom 300E enters the light business jet segment to some stiff competition from traditional stalwarts like Textron's Cessna Citation CJ3+ and Bombardier's Learjet 70. There are even new entrants like Switzerland's Pilatus PC-24.\n\nEven though Embraer is a renowned Brazilian planemaker, the company builds its dedicated private jets like the Phenom and Legacy 500 at its facility in Melbourne, Florida. It's larger, commercial airliner-derived private jets like the Legacy 650E and the Lineage 1000E will continue to be produced in Brazil.\n\nEarlier this year, Business Insider got the chance to experience the Phenom 300E in person on a short a demo flight from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to White Plains in New York.\n\nTeterboro is also where we checked out the $20 million Embraer Legacy 500 last year.\n\nHere's a closer look at the new Embraer Phenom 300E:", "Citigroup has made what some analysts have called \"the biggest corporate governance decision\" at the bank in six years.\n\nThe third-biggest US bank by assets on Monday named the former US regulator John Dugan to be its next chairman of the board after Mike O'Neill decided to retire from the position earlier than expected.\n\nThe choice of Dugan rather than Citi CEO Mike Corbat preserves a split role for chairman and CEO that has existed at Citigroup since the financial crisis but is rare across Wall Street. It comes as Citi has undergone a slew of changes over the past several months, including the departures of key executives and restructurings within their business lines. It also comes amid investor frustration with the bank's stock price, which has lagged peers', analysts have said.\n\nThe bank is in the midst of a plan to return at least $60 billion in capital to shareholders over three years and to raise its return-on-equity into the low teens. The activist investor ValueAct owns a $1 billion stake.\n\nThere was some thought leading up to Citi's decision that Corbat, who has run the bank since 2012, could consolidate his power by taking over the chairmanship from O'Neill. O'Neill asked Corbat last year whether he wanted the board to consider him for the chairman's job, according to a person familiar with the board's decision. But after several months of deliberation, Corbat decided to stay focused on the CEO role, the person said. Avoiding shareholder outrage factored into his thinking, the person said.\n\nCiti has had a split role for more than 10 years, in contrast to its rivals JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America, which all have the roles of chairman and CEO placed in the hands of one person. That change at Citi happened after Chuck Prince, who oversaw a rush into collateralized debt obligations that brought the bank to its knees, stepped down as chairman and CEO in November 2007.\n\nO'Neill, chairman since April 2012, was set to give up his role next year after hitting the mandatory retirement age of 72. This announcement accelerates the process, largely to give Dugan time to settle in before the firm's annual meeting, according to a person briefed on the decision. The board made the decision on Sunday, the person said.\n\nDugan will become chairman on January 1, according to a statement. He'll oversee a 16-person board.\n\nHe has served on Citi's board since November 2017 and served as an adviser for several years earlier.

After vets treated the cat's chipped tooth and collapsed lungs, the feline was sent home two days later.\n\nCats fall a lot, and they've gotten really good at it. Drop a cat upside down, for example, and it will almost always land on its feet. That's because cats are extremely flexible. They can twist their bodies mid-air as they fall.\n\nBut landing feet first isn't always the best strategy. Like if you're falling from 32 stories up. To figure out how cats manage that perfect landing every time, a series of studies looked at over a 100 cats' falls from two to 32 stories up.\n\nComes as no surprise that cats who fell from the second floor had fewer injuries than cats who fell from the sixth floor. But here is the fascinating part. Above the seventh story, the extent of the injuries largely stayed the same, no matter how high the cats fell. So, how is that possible?\n\nWell, it all comes down to acrobatics or lack thereof. Cats that fell from two to seven stories up mostly landed feet first. Above that, however, cats used a different technique. Instead of positioning their legs straight down as they fell, they splayed out like a parachuter. And landed belly-first instead.\n\nBut this method isn't 100% foolproof. Chest trauma, like a collapsed lung, or broken rib is more common with this landing method. But the risk of breaking a leg is much less. So, how do cats somehow subconsciously know how to land?\n\nIt has to do with a physics phenomenon called terminal velocity. At first, the cat plummets faster and faster under gravity until she's fallen the equivalent of five stories. At that point, she hits constant terminal velocity at 100 kilometers per hour. She's now in free fall where air friction counteracts her acceleration under gravity. At this point, she's no longer accelerating and, more importantly, doesn't feel the pull from gravity.\n\nSo, here's what researchers think is happening. From two to seven stories up, cats don't have enough time to reach terminal velocity and prep for landing feet first. But once they hit terminal velocity, their instinct changes and they parachute their limbs.\n\nAll that said, don't throw your cat out of a window. I can't believe I have to say this. Not only is it still very dangerous, it's not very polite. Don't throw your cat out the window just to see all that go down. Just watch this video again.

I don't have the right genetics. I haven't even worked out in 10 years!\"\n\nBack in college, I firmly believed, \"I could never gain muscle. I'm just a skinny Indian guy.\" I thought this was a fact of life, like the sky being blue, and accepted it.\n\nBut then I started to see people around me \u2014 including other Indian guys \u2014 bulk up.\n\nSlowly, I realized this belief of \"I can't gain muscle\" was total BS.\n\nI used to think lifting was only for meatheads, but I was the only one standing in the way of my goal.\n\nThe same is true for earning more money.\n\nWe don't think we can do it because nobody ever teaches us how! And we never see people like us do it, so we have no reason to believe we can.\n\nWe're left with a deep-rooted, toxic belief that earning more is only for \"other\" people. Then tell ourselves things like, \"I can't earn more, I don't have time/an idea/the right background.\"\n\nThis is just a self-limiting belief.\n\nJust like how I was able to destroy my own beliefs about gaining muscle, you could shatter your beliefs about earning more \u2026 and actually do it.\n\nRelated: I've helped thousands of people start their own businesses, and I've found that everyone who makes money has the same thing in common\n\nLet's start small\n\nOnce you realize your limiting beliefs aren't facts, or truth, you can get started earning more money. Earning an extra $10,000 may seem impossible, but let's break it down.\n\nIf you ask yourself instead how you would earn an extra $500, $1,000, or $5,000, coming up with realistic solutions becomes more manageable. Here I'll break down the math:\n\nLet's assume you make $50 per hour. If you worked 10 hours per week for five months, you could earn an extra $10,000.\n\nTo earn $10,000 on the side in five months:\n\n$50/hr X 10 hrs/week X 5 months = $10,000\n\nBoom!\n\nAnd that's just the start. As you gain confidence and get more clients, you can double your rates and earn that $10,000 in half the time.\n\nTo earn $10,000 on the side in two and a half months:\n\n$100/hr X 10 hrs/week X 2.5 months = $10,000\n\nWhether you actually make $50 per hour is beside the point.\n\nThe real message is this: If goals seem too out-of-reach, we're not able to visualize what to do.

The minimum amount to qualify for free shipping has dropped over the years, to $25 from a high of $49.\n\nIt may be because Amazon wants to compete with big-box stores that are also offering free-shipping promotions for the holidays. Most notably, Target announced last month that it would offer free two-day shipping to all customers until December 22, with no order minimum.

She should have walked earlier. It's a little bit excusable. The umpire maybe should not have pushed her there. It's unfortunate, but an incredible case study.\"\n\nThe code violations and the reactions of Williams were widely reported in the subsequent days, with Australian newspaper The Herald Sun lampooning her in a \"racist and misogynistic\" cartoon that grossly exaggerated her features. It then embarked on a mean-spirited crusade and called her \"no feminist hero,\" something Business Insider refuted at the time.\n\nWilliams responded to the furore a week later and said women \"should be able to do even half of what a guy can do.\"\n\nFor Federer, the issue was not a distraction from the sport itself, but rather something that \"gets the ball rolling\" for the \"good of society.\"\n\nHe said that poor behaviours in tennis are few and far between, especially when compared to the UFC and its star fighter Conor McGregor.\n\nIrish striker McGregor has attracted plenty of bad press as he invaded the cage at a Bellator event in 2017, threw a dolly through a bus window which injured UFC athletes in an attack earlier this year, and more recently was accused of racism for comments against Floyd Mayweather and for talking about Khabib Nurmagomedov's religion and background.\n\n\"We do so well in tennis; our sport is so well behaved,\" Federer said. \"You see the UFC guy throw a railing, or in other sports they spit and swear at each other on a regular basis.

An annual regional cybersecurity survey revealed in May that over 40 per cent of the latter have had at least one breach in the last year, more than 10 per cent up on 2016 - though no mention of the likely source of the attacks was disclosed in reports on the findings.\n\nBut in September American Cybersecurity firm FireEye revealed that a suspected Iranian hacking group, which it has been monitoring for a number of years, had been conducting a \"spear-phishing\" email campaign against organisations based in the Middle East, North America and Japan, in sectors ranging from oil and gas, insurance to manufacturing. FireEye reportedly said the emails from the group, which it has named APT33, may have sought to steal information or prepare for disruptive attacks.\n\nAmerica has been bracing itself for cyber retaliation following its renewal of sanctions on Iran in the wake of President's Trump's withdrawal from the international nuclear deal, the JCPOA, earlier this year. Notwithstanding Washington's concerns, its allies in the Gulf seem more likely targets as their defences against digital sabotage have been found wanting, resulting in substantial losses.\n\nDamage from cyber attacks last year cost more than $1 billion\n\nA PwC survey in 2016 showed that companies in the Middle East suffered larger losses than other regions the previous year as a result of cyber incidents, with 18 per cent of respondents in the region experiencing more than 5,000 attacks, compared to a global average of 9 per cent.\n\nIn March, a report by Siemens and the think-tank the Ponemon Institute said that the financial impact in the Gulf of digital attacks on oil and gas organisations was last year estimated to be more than $1 billion.\n\nFollowing Trump's abandonment of the JCPOA, over what he saw as its failure to stem Iran's ballistic missile programme and destabilising influence in the region, a first set of so-called snapback sanctions came into effect in August. They imposed bans on certain US dollar and rial transactions and restrictions on several sectors, including automotive, industrial raw materials and precious metals. A second, potentially more damaging, tranche of measures targeting Iran's oil industry, its principal source of foreign currency, starts this month.\n\nA curb on oil exports could plunge Iran's ailing economy into crisis. Prior to the August sanctions, Tehran had threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major shipping lane for western-bound Gulf oil. While it could yet carry out its threat after this month's measures are imposed, such an act would lead to a huge escalation in tensions with Washington, which the Iranians would probably not want. A seemingly more likely form of retaliation would be destructive cyberattacks against the US and its allies in the Middle East.\n\nSpear-phishing surge in July\n\nFireEye reportedly said that it had seen a surge in the number the spear-phishing emails targeting their clients in July, shortly before the first batch of snapback sanctions. It said that there were a number of signs that they were the work of hackers aligned with Tehran, including the use of Iranian hosting companies and links to an institute believed to play an important role in the regime's cyber operations, according to media reports.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Dubai in September, Alister Shepherd, an executive at a consulting arm of FireEye, was quoted in the regional newspaper the National as saying it was possible that APT33 was using the spear-phishing emails \"to facilitate the theft of intellectual property or to subsequently cause disruption in retaliation to the sanctions\". The Associated Press news agency quoted Shepherd pointing out that \"whenever we see Iranian threat groups active in the region, particularly in line with geopolitical events, we have to be concerned that they may be engaged in, or pre-positioning for, a disruptive attack\".\n\nA destructive attack would not be unprecedented. In August 2012, in possible retaliation for an earlier cyber sabotage of its nuclear facilities, suspected Iranian hackers destroyed data on thousands of Saudi Aramco's computers. Not long after, the hackers are thought to have conducted a similar attack on the the Qatari natural gas producer RasGas. At the time, Leon Panetta, then US Defence Secretary, described the targeting of the Saudi oil giant as probably the most destructive cyberattack on a private business.\n\nGulf firms are a soft target for hackers\n\nThen, towards the end of 2016, the virus used in the Aramco incident reappeared in an updated form, destroying Saudi government and private sector databases and files, in apparent retaliation for the kingdom's interventions in the Syrian and Yemeni conflicts, according to a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) says with the emergence of digitisation in Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), business and government online services in the region have become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. \"GCC states have invested in cyber security, but in most member states these have not been sufficient to tackle the growing number and frequency of cyber attacks,\" it said in a report in April.\n\nAn industry survey conducted in late 2016 suggested that Gulf firms are a 'soft target' for hackers. In its recent report, the EIU noted Saudi Arabia has yet to upgrade its cyber security and related technology to global standards. The Unit said the kingdom scored poorly on its 2018-19 measure of cyber preparedness in the GCC. At a time when tensions with Iran are high, this may prove to be a serious oversight.\n\nYigal Chazan is head of content at Alaco, a London-based business intelligence consultancy.", "US President Donald Trump.

Or more specifically, the $5 billion fine the EU slapped on Google in July for abusing the dominance of Android.\n\nTrump railed against the fine on the day it was issued, tweeting that the EU has \"taken advantage\" of the US and is punishing \"one of our great companies.\" He doubled down on this sentiment on Sunday, saying he didn't like the EU sanctions.\n\nRead more: Google employees all over the world left their desk and walked out in protest over sexual misconduct\n\nBut that doesn't mean that the US president is averse to stealing the EU's ideas.

Scientist raised the alarm and ozone-depleting chemicals were phased out worldwide.\n\nAs a result, the upper ozone layer above the Northern Hemisphere should be completely repaired in the 2030s and the gaping Antarctic ozone hole should disappear in the 2060s, according to a scientific assessment released Monday at a conference in Quito, Ecuador. The Southern Hemisphere lags a bit and its ozone layer should be healed by mid-century.\n\n\"It's really good news,\" said report co-chairman Paul Newman, chief Earth scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If ozone-depleting substances had continued to increase, we would have seen huge effects. We stopped that.\"\n\nHigh in the atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer, crop damage and other problems. Use of man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which release chlorine and bromine, began eating away at the ozone. In 1987, countries around the world agreed in the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs and businesses came up with replacements for spray cans and other uses.\n\nAt its worst in the late 1990s, about 10 percent of the upper ozone layer was depleted, said Newman. Since 2000, it has increased by about 1 to 3 percent per decade, the report said.\n\nThis year, the ozone hole over the South Pole peaked at nearly 9.6 million square miles (24.8 million square kilometers). That's about 16 percent smaller than the biggest hole recorded \u2014 11.4 million square miles (29.6 million square kilometers) in 2006.\n\nThe hole reaches its peak in September and October and disappears by late December until the next Southern Hemisphere spring, Newman said.\n\nThe ozone layer starts at about 6 miles (10 kilometers) above Earth and stretches for nearly 25 miles (40 kilometers); ozone is a colorless combination of three oxygen atoms.\n\nIf nothing had been done to stop the thinning, the world would have destroyed two-thirds of its ozone layer by 2065, Newman said.\n\nBut it's not a complete success yet, said University of Colorado's Brian Toon, who wasn't part of the report.\n\n\"We are only at a point where recovery may have started,\" Toon said, pointing to some ozone measurements that haven't increased yet.\n\nAnother problem is that new technology has found an increase in emissions of a banned CFC out of East Asia, the report noted.\n\nAnd the replacements now being used to cool cars and refrigerators need to be replaced themselves with chemicals that don't worsen global warming, Newman said. An amendment to the Montreal Protocol that goes into effect next year would cut use of some of those gases.\n\n\"I don't think we can do a victory lap until 2060,\" Newman said. \"That will be for our grandchildren to do.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter: @borenbears .\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

He joined the firm's private-wealth management unit, where as a junior analyst he helped senior wealth advisers. He dabbled in trading bitcoin in his spare time beginning in 2013, as Goldman had rules around trading single stocks but not digital assets.\n\nIt was from here that Hassan developed an interest in crypto that would later turn into a full-time job. After a stint at another financial firm, Hassan teamed up with former Goldman colleagues to launch Crescent Crypto Asset Management, one of the first funds to offer passive exposure to bitcoin for wealthy investors.\n\nHassan said founding a company at such a young age came with distinct advantages: no golden handcuffs and no family ties holding back a would-be entrepreneur.\n\n\"The longer you stay at an organization, the longer you work for someone, the harder it gets to let it all go and take the risk and strike out on your own,\" he said.\n\n'Work to that plan'\n\nFor those eyeing a similar trajectory, Hassan recommends planning ahead.\n\n\"Before you even get into your first job, before you really land that analyst role, have a plan two to three years from now \u2014 'I would love to run this, I would like to have a business that does this' \u2014 and work to that plan,\" Hassan said.\n\nThat plan includes surrounding yourself with the right people, particularly if you need cofounders to execute a big idea.\n\n\"Build that core group of friends in your network who will jump on good ideas with you,\" Hassan said. \"Because I was surrounded by people who also had the same vision of working for themselves and doing their own thing, we kind of willed it into existence.\"\n\nAfter 18 months running his own company, Hassan has no plans to return to working for someone else.\n\n\"Once people realize how freeing it is and how amazing it is to be the master of your own domain and eat what you kill, it's amazing,\" he said. \"I wish someone had told me that and luckily I found out on my own.\"\n\nFor Wall Streeters just getting started, Hassan recommends asking for help early on to be efficient and helpful.

Another compared Donald Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But they were just warm-up acts for the main event, the blunt former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who while technically an independent is a champion of causes held dear by liberal progressive Democrats.\n\nTrump, Sanders said, was \"the most racist, sexist, homophobic, bigoted president in history,\" adding later for good measure that Trump was a \"pathological liar.\"\n\nThe crowd thundered in approval.\n\nSanders, a US senator from the liberal state of Vermont, is expected to win reelection easily in Tuesday's congressional elections, so he took little political risk in bashing the president. Still, his rhetoric on the stump made for a stark contrast with most Democratic candidates.\n\nDemocrats have largely resisted excoriating Trump on his words and actions, though he has denounced the party at his political rallies as an angry, dangerous \"mob.\"\n\nAs recently as last week, when Trump was accused of sowing division with his response to the synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh and harsh rhetoric on migrants traveling to the US border from Central America, voters heard little about that from Democrats running for Congress.\n\nDemocratic candidates were much more likely to be talking about healthcare or economic inequality. That was by design. The party, early in this congressional election season, made a collective determination not to regularly confront the president, according to multiple party sources.\n\nThat has left many Democrats, particularly those from the party's liberal progressive wing, frustrated. They accuse the party of being too timid, too afraid of alienating moderate voters. They argue that the party needs to find its critical voice during what they see as a national crisis \u2014 and that they risk not making a clear case to voters about the values for which the party stands.\n\n\"It's a sign of their weakness. It's a sign of their ineffectiveness that they're afraid to do it,\" said Ed Mattos, 70, of Rockville, Maryland, who attended the Sanders rally.\n\nLinda Sarsour, a party activist and an organizer of the nationwide Women's March, which was fueled by anger over Trump's 2016 victory, argued that Democrats must \"unapologetically call out the president\" while providing their own vision for the country.\n\n\"We have to have a very clear alternative,\" she said. \"We have to give America two choices here.\"\n\nBaked in\n\nTrump at a campaign rally in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Sunday.

Polls show Democrats on Tuesday should win the 23 seats they need to assume control of the House of Representatives and perhaps as many as 15 or 20 seats beyond that. Democrats are expected to fall short of the two seats they need to reach the majority in the Senate.\n\nNew road map\n\nHillary Clinton and Trump during a presidential debate in October 2016.

However, the opportunities presented by the growing popularity of e-commerce also come with a challenging, multibillion-dollar downside: returns.\n\nReturn rates for e-commerce purchases are between 25% and 30%, compared with just 9% for in-store purchases. Turning reverse logistics \u2014 the process of returning goods from end users back to their origins to either recapture value or properly dispose of material \u2014 into a costly and high-stakes matter for retailers.\n\nNot only are retailers experiencing more returns as a result of e-commerce growth, but consumer expectations also demand that retailers provide a seamless process. In fact, 92% of consumers agree that they are more likely to shop at a store again if it offers a hassle-free return policy (e.g. free return shipping labels). Some consumers even place large orders with the intention of returning certain items.\n\nAnd e-commerce sales are only going up from here, exacerbating the issue and making retailers' need for help more dire. However, for logistics firms that can offer cost-effective reverse logistics solutions, this has opened up a significant opportunity to capture a share of rapidly growing e-commerce logistics costs in the US, which hit $117 billion last year, according to Armstrong & Associates, Inc. estimates.\n\nIn The Reverse Logistics Report, Business Insider Intelligence examines what makes reverse logistics so much more challenging than forward logistics, explores the trends that have driven retailers to finally improve the way in which returns move through their supply chains, and highlights how logistics firms can act to win over retailers' return dollars.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nE-commerce is now a core shopping channel for retailers, and it's still growing. US e-commerce sales are set to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% between 2018 and 2023, surpassing $1 trillion in sales, according to Business Insider Intelligence estimates.\n\nBooming e-commerce sales have driven product returns through the roof. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that US e-commerce returns will increase at a CAGR of 19% between 2018 and 2023, surpassing $300 million dollars.\n\nConsumers have high expectations about how returns are handled, and retailers are struggling to find cost-effective ways to meet their demands. Sixty-four percent of shoppers stated they would be hesitant to shop at a retailer ever again if they found issues with the returns process. And retailers don't have the expertise to effectively keep up with how demanding consumers are about returns \u2014 44% of retailers said their margins were negatively impacted by handling and packaging returns, for example.\n\nLogistics firms are well positioned to solve \u2014 and profit from \u2014 returns. These companies can take advantage of their scale and expertise to solve pain points retailers commonly experience as goods move through the reverse supply chain.\n\nReverse logistics solutions themselves present a lucrative opportunity \u2014 but they're also appealing in the potential inroads they offer to supply chain management. The global third-party logistics market is estimated to be valued at $865 billion in 2018, according to Bekryl.", "For some people, polyamory is an exciting idea. rawpixel.com / Unsplash\n\nTo some people, the idea of polyamory \u2014 the term describing having more than one romantic partner \u2014 is exciting.\n\nIn polyamorous relationships, a couple decides they will give each other the freedom to meet, flirt, and hook up with other people. Sometimes they may invite another person into the relationship permanently, in what's known as a triad.\n\nBut it's not as simple as finding a third person you both fancy. In fact, according to Dr Elisabeth Sheff, expert witness, speaker, and coach of polyamory and author of \"The Polyamorists Next Door,\" straight couples often come into the polyamorous community expecting to find a bi woman to join them. This, she said, is called \"unicorn hunting.\"\n\nSheff's former husband introduced her to the idea of polyamory with exactly this intention. He wanted another woman to sleep with, but he didn't particularly want her to be able to meet other men. Apparently in the poly community, this is quite a clich\u00e9.\n\n\"She's known as 'the unicorn' because she's so rare, and almost mythical,\" Sheff told Business Insider. \"He thought he was so edgy and out there, and we could have a wife the two of us together.\n\n\"As it turns out, it's every straight boy's fantasy. It doesn't fly well in the poly community. And when he didn't get what he wanted, he had a tantrum, and didn't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nWhen couples can't find a unicorn, Sheff said it's common that the woman has actually started to quite enjoy the freedom of polyamory. She may have been reluctant to try it at first, but turns out to be the one who enjoys it more.\n\n\"The woman of the couple finds other people to socialise with, and the man realises he's not the centre of attention that he [thought he] would be, and thinks 'this isn't as much fun as I thought it would be,'\" Sheff said. \"These couples either blow up, [or] some of them return to monogamy... and she might have a little more clout than she used to. But if she really likes it, and he really can't stand it, they'll break up.\"\n\nUnicorn hunting is usually considered with suspicion and scorn. MiniStocker / Unsplash\n\nRemember \u2014 everyone has feelings\n\nAlex* is in a polyamorous relationship with his wife. They were monogamous for a long time, but ended up making friends with many polyamorous people, and it turned into quite a normal thing in their social circle.\n\nHe told Business Insider he's not aware of a situation where a male-female couple actively seeking a bi woman has worked out well.\n\n\"I don't really feel like there is a consistent way of thinking about these things in the many varied ways people approach polyamory,\" he said. \"But amongst my friends 'unicorn hunting' is usually considered with suspicion and scorn.\"\n\n\"The stereotype at least is that unicorn hunting couples are looking to treat a partner as an object in their relationship,\" he added. \"They want someone \u2014 maybe anyone, reducible to their gender, sexuality, and availability \u2014 that fits into their lives and fits their relationship without thinking about the needs and human perspectives of the person they're looking for.\"\n\nIn other words, it can look a lot like people wanting to have their cake and eat it too, without actually taking into account anyone else's feelings. This is what Sheff felt when her ex-husband first came up with the idea.\n\n\"My instinct is to say that 'unicorn hunting' couples are likely not taking the considerate and compassionate approach which I associate with polyamory,\" Alex said. \"But like I say, this is something of a stereotype, and folk are welcome to do whatever works for them, right?\"\n\n* Name changed for anonymity.", "LONDON \u2014 British voters would rather stay in the EU than accept leaving without a deal, according to a new poll.\n\nThe survey of 3,006 voters for Politico, found that British voters would choose by a margin of 53.5% to remain in the EU if the alternative was leaving under a no-deal scenario \"with the potential for disruption,\" an option favour ed by just 46.5%.\n\nThe news is likely to bolster calls from anti-Brexit campaigners for the government to arrange a second Brexit referendum on the terms of Britain's departure from the EU, with an option to remain on the ballot paper.\n\nBut the poll, carried out by Hanbury Strategy for Politico, also illustrates the strategic headache facing Theresa May. Her own voters are much more hardline than the wider electorate, so she must try and keep her own core supporters happy her Brexit strategy while finding a solution which other voters deem suitable.\n\nThat dilemma is reflected in other questions in the survey. By 47% to 35%, voters say that May should \"compromise\" with the EU to get a deal rather than walk away without one in March 2019, when the country is scheduled to leave.\n\nVoters narrowly support extending the twenty-month transition period by 39% to 38% \u2014 during which the UK would effectively remain a member of the EU but have no say in decision-making \u2014 even if it costs \"billions\" of pounds to do so.\n\nBut among Conservative voters (those who supported the party in the 2017 election), 48% would prefer that Theresa May walked away from the EU without a deal than compromise, compared to 41% who would prefer her to compromise.\n\nMay's dilemma\n\nTheresa May Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nThe polling reflects the party's electoral dilemma as it faces up to the Labour party which is also committed to implementing the EU referendum result. Many Conservative MPs are aware that their success at the next election could depend on them supporting a Brexit outcome which draws the UK away from EU rules and regulations, and is seen to honour the result of the referendum.\n\nBut it is increasingly clear that any deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels will be a compromise which contains guarantees to avoid a hard border in Ireland and could therefore keep the UK in parts of the European single market or customs union.\n\nThe question of how many Tories would support such a compromise when the deal was put before parliament remains the subject of intense speculation.\n\nReports emerged over the weekend that the prime minister is close to securing a final deal with Brussels on the terms of the UK's exit, but EU officials quickly pushed back on the speculation to say the chances of a deal remained at around 50%. The Irish backstop \u2014 an insurance policy designed by the EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland \u2014 remains the biggest sticking point, with both sides holding on for a compromise from their counterparts.\n\nNonetheless, negotiators hope that enough progress will be made this week to strike a deal, providing time to sign an agreement off at a special summit of EU leaders in mid-November.", "The hedge fund manager famous for betting against the US housing market ahead of the 2008 crash is shorting two British bank stocks in anticipation that the UK falls out of the European Union without securing an exit deal.\n\n\"I'm shorting two stocks in the UK,\" he told a conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, over the weekend, as reported by Bloomberg. He wouldn't name the companies.\n\nHe reportedly told the conference that he expected the UK to secure a deal with Brussels that the UK Parliament would reject, ultimately forcing Britain out of the bloc without agreed-upon terms.\n\nBloomberg noted that Metro Bank and CYBG, the parent company of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, were the two most shorted UK financial stocks.\n\nSome 6.6% of Metro Bank's stock is being shorted, data from Castellain Capital's Short Interest Tracker showed on Monday morning.\n\nEisman said that while he was shorting just two UK stocks, that number could rise as high as 50 if the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn were to become prime minister, because he believes Corbyn's policies would be detrimental to the UK economy.\n\n\"I've got a screen of about 50, and I might short all 50 if I think Jeremy Corbyn is going to be prime minister,\" he said.\n\n\"Corbyn's a Trotskyite,\" he added. \"Now I know my Trotskyites well, and I know you don't want to be invested in the UK if a Trotskyite is prime minister.\"\n\nEisman was one of the protagonists in \"The Big Short,\" the nonfiction book by Michael Lewis about the 2008 subprime-mortgage bubble in the US.

This would mean no new customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nHowever, while this deals with customs, it does not address the tricky issue of regulations.\n\nIf Northern Ireland alone stays wedded to EU regulations, this would create new border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK relating to agriculture. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said last month that checks on live animals and animal-derived products would increase tenfold on current inspections.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party that props up May's fragile government has described new checks as unacceptable and could withdraw the support for the Conservatives if the prime minister fails to satisfy their demands.\n\nBarnier is set to deliver a speech in Brussels at 19:30 (GMT) where he is set to discuss the current state of Brexit talks.", "Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are suing a cryptocurrency investor.

They think that we have answers, and unfortunately we don't.\"\n\n\"It's confusing and difficult,\" Abdullah Khashoggi said. \"It's not a normal situation and not a normal death.\"\n\nStill, the brothers expressed confidence in Saudi King Salman. \"The king has stressed that everybody involved will be brought to justice,\" Salah Khashoggi said. \"And I have faith in that.\"", "It was far from the 'Absolument Non' that many French loyalists had hoped for, but following Sunday's historic independence referendum in New Caledonia, the archipelago will remain a French posession for at least a couple more years.\n\nProvisional results, released by French officials on Sunday night, had the count in favor of staying with the republic, with 78,400 people voting \"no\" to independence, while 60,600 voted \"yes,\" to independence, representing a tighter-than-expected margin of 56.4% to 43.6%.\n\nDelighted to claim victory and with a scarcely hidden relief, French President Emmanuel Macron announced the results in a nationally televised address from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nThe referendum, the latest step in a rocky road of French decolonization, is the first independence vote to be held in French territories jealously guarded by Paris since Djibouti voted \"yes\" for independence in 1977.\n\nThe landmark vote had been a pledge made by the French government almost 20 years ago in an effort to strike an accord and halt a violent separatist campaign run by supporters of the indigenous Kanak people.\n\nThe referendum literally put France to the vote in its far-flung remaining Pacific territory, which is heavily dependent on French state subsidies, yet where many are divided or conflicted, regarding a republic that is seen to have often forgotten many of its historic obligations.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron reacts after a meeting and family photo with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Evaluation Commission at the Elysee Place in Paris, France May 16, 2017.

But with a troubled and complex history, the question of independence and a severing of ties with the French Republic is not as simply black-and-white as some post-colonial observers have tried to characterize.\n\nWhile the name \"Kanak\" follows from the Hawaiian \"kanake,\" or \"true\" (person), and was in fact used broadly by early European colonists in the Pacific, the last 30 years of debate in New Caledonia has also seen the emergence of pro-republican Kanaks who support the French settlers, known as \"Caldoche\" \u2014 though they prefer to be called \"Caledonians.\"\n\nInto this mix are thrown citizens of French Polynesia, Wallis, Chinese, Japanese, and Algerian backgrounds all spread across the archipelego from Noumea to the Isle of Pines, all eligible to vote.\n\nNoumea is also the financial capital, with a strong tourism and resources-based economy.\n\nFrench foreign legionnaire arrive in Darwin, Australia, from New Caledonia and Paris as some 164 French troops and medical personnel to join the international peacekeeping force in East Timor Sunday, Sept. 19, 1999.

In a sadly familiar narrative from the period, massacres of poorly armed local populations were first reported 2 or 3 years later.\n\nFormal annexation by the French government in 1853 began the total disenfranchisement of the Kanaks. Massacres and land seizures ensued, particularly in and around what is now the capital Noumea, still a largely Eurocentric enclave to this day.\n\nAfter fighting with courage under a French flag during both world wars, the Kanak people won a hard-fought citizenship and New Caledonia emerged from its colonial yoke and became French territory in 1956, with universal suffrage granted a year later.\n\nAt the time, population numbers were roughly even between Kanak and non-Indigenous \u2014 but reinvigorated migration, encouraged by a post-war Paris seeking to recover its prestige, soon saw the balance tilt in favor of a Eurocentric population enriched by burgeoning nickel exports.\n\nSince 1984, the independence movement has called for the September 24 anniversary of the French annexation to be made the \"Kanak Mourning Day\" public holiday.\n\nThe militant pro-independence Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale Kanak et Socialiste \u2014 which was formed the same year, called for the boycott of French institutions and elections.\n\nLed by Jean-Marie Tjibaou, whose life inspired the magnificent cultural center that carries his name, the provisional government of the Kanak Socialist Republic was declared in December 1984.\n\nFollowing further cycles of conflict and violence, a 1998 deal culminating in the processes that led to the weekend's historic ballot, guaranteed a referendum on independence before 2018.\n\nAnd while New Caledonia pushed back again from independence this weekend, according to reports from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Kanak pro-independence voters also took to the streets of Noumea to celebrate the unexpected closeness of the vote.\n\nThey are certain to carry this momentum into campaigning ahead of the next referendum, in just two years time.", "Hello!

But it quickly became a last-minute flashpoint in one of the nation's most closely contested governor's races as Tuesday's election loomed.\n\nDemocrats viewed the development as more evidence that Kemp's office, which oversees elections, was serving as an extension of his gubernatorial campaign. Republicans, meanwhile, framed it as an instance of Democrats trying to arrange nefarious votes. It's playing out the same day that Kemp will campaign alongside President Donald Trump in Macon.\n\nAs he left the White House on Sunday for Georgia, Trump said he hadn't been briefed on the issue and didn't know anything about it.\n\nKemp is currently neck and neck in the polls with Democrat Stacey Abrams. AP Photo/John Amis\n\nKemp's office said federal authorities had been notified. The FBI declined to comment on the matter. A representative for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the agency had been notified, but it deferred to Georgia officials for details.\n\nSunday's announcement came as the Coalition for Good Governance, a plaintiff in a lawsuit against Kemp alleging gross negligence in managing the state's elections, cited published reports saying a third party had discovered that Georgia's online registered voter database \u2014 which his office manages \u2014 is subject to hacking that could alter voters' information or remove them from the registered voter list altogether.\n\nUniversity of Michigan computer scientist Matthew Bernhard reviewed the reported flaw \u2014 which the Democratic Party on Saturday asked several computer scientists to review \u2014 and told The Associated Press it could have allowed anyone with access to an individual voter's personal information to alter the record of any voter in the system.\n\nThe finger-pointing is the latest turn in a campaign whose final weeks have been dominated by charges of voter suppression and countercharges of attempted voter fraud. Early voters cast ballots in Atlanta, Georgia on October 18. Jessica McGowan/Getty\n\nDemocrat Stacey Abrams, who would become the nation's first black female governor if she wins, has called Kemp \"an architect of voter suppression\" and says he's used his post as chief elections officer to make it harder for certain voters to cast ballots. Kemp counters that he's following state and federal law and that it's Abrams and her affiliated voting advocacy groups trying to help people, including noncitizens, cast ballots illegally.\n\nRead more: Georgia's top election official and GOP gubernatorial candidate is being sued for putting 53,000 voter registrations on hold for mistakes like missing hyphens\n\nThe atmosphere has left partisans and good-government advocates alike worrying about the possibility that the losing side will not accept Tuesday's results as legitimate. Polls suggest a tight race.\n\nThe accusation is not the first from Kemp accusing outsiders of trying to penetrate his office. Immediately after the 2016 general election, Kemp accused the federal Department of Homeland Security of trying to hack his office's network, an accusation dismissed in mid-2017 by the DHS inspector general as unfounded.\n\nEven before he was running for governor, Kemp faced criticism over Georgia's election system.\n\nGeorgia's current centrally managed elections system lacks a verifiable paper trail that can be audited in case of problems. The state is one of just five nationwide that continues to rely exclusively on aged electronic voting machines that computer scientists have long criticized as untrustworthy because they are easily hacked and don't leave a paper trail.\n\nKemp has previously been accused by election-integrity activists of mismanaging state elections as Georgia's top elections official through poor oversight and in resisting the transparency they say is necessary to instill faith in the process.\n\nIn 2015, Kemp's office inadvertently released the Social Security numbers and other identifying information of millions of Georgia voters. His office blamed a clerical error.\n\nHis office made headlines again last year after security experts disclosed a gaping security hole that wasn't fixed until six months after it was first reported to election authorities. Personal data was again exposed for Georgia's 6.7 million voters, as were passwords used by county officials to access files.\n\nKemp's office laid the blame for that breach on Kennesaw State University, which managed the system on Kemp's behalf.\n\nIn the voting integrity case, a federal judge last month endorsed the plaintiff's arguments that Kemp has been derelict in his management of the state election system and that it violates voters' constitutional rights with its lack of verifiability and reliability.", "The New Orleans Saints sent a huge message to the rest of the NFL, beating the Los Angeles Rams, 45-35, on Sunday. In doing so, the Saints became the first team this year to beat the star-studded Rams.\n\nBoth teams entered the game as the hottest teams in the league. The Saints have not lost since a surprising Week 1 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers while the Rams were the last undefeated team in the NFL.\n\nThe NFL world expected a shootout, and early on, both teams delivered. The Rams and Saints exchanged two touchdowns each on the first four possessions of the game, with both clubs showing off their talented running backs (Alvin Kamara for the Saints, Todd Gurley for the Rams) and precise passing attacks.\n\nAt the end of the first half, however, the Saints took control. After the Rams missed a field goal to end the scoring streak, the Saints scored on a 13-yard touchdown pass to tight end Benjamin Watson. On the ensuing possession, the Saints picked off Rams quarterback Jared Goff, then got a third touchdown from Kamara to take a 35-14 lead.\n\nBut just as the Saints seized control in the first half, the Rams came out attacking in the second half, nearly wrestling back control of the game.\n\nThe Rams defense, boasting All-Pros like Aaron Donald, Ndamukong Suh, and Marcus Peters, got after the Saints, forcing consecutive punts. Meanwhile, Goff and company found their groove, spreading the ball around to score 18 straight points on three drives.\n\nAfter the Rams evened the score at 35, it was the Saints defense that won them the game. They forced a crucial punt, allowing Drew Brees to get the ball back and hit Michael Thomas on a 72-yard shot down the field.\n\nIt was hard to watch the two heavyweights battle it out and not imagine them facing off in January, perhaps in the NFC championship. Both teams entered Sunday with top-five offenses in DVOA. While their defenses haven't lived up to expectations, they are both capable at getting stops or creating big plays when they need to.\n\nNo team in the league is hotter than the Saints right now.
