There's long been speculation that the special counsel was holding off on making any big moves until after the midterm elections, because of DOJ guidelines barring investigators from taking any overt actions that could be seen as influencing the outcome of an election.\n\nStill, the news raised questions among some legal experts, who wondered whether the special counsel had moved up his timetable following Trump's decision to oust Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday. The president replaced the long-embattled Sessions with former US attorney Matthew Whitaker, a hardline loyalist who has publicly railed against Mueller and the Russia probe.\n\nRead more: Justice Department confirms Jeff Sessions' replacement will take over the Mueller probe\n\nWhitaker has reportedly been described as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the DOJ. He also said in a CNN op-ed last year that Mueller had overstepped his mandate by digging into the Trump Organization's finances. And The Daily Beast has reported the new acting attorney general made the rounds in right-wing media over the past two years claiming there was \"no collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russian interests.\n\nOn Thursday, The Washington Post reported that Whitaker has no plans to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, despite his history of making antagonistic remarks about the special counsel.\n\nWhitaker's appointment comes as Trump's lawyers are putting the finishing touches on their written answers to a first round of questions from Mueller about potential collusion. They are refusing to answer questions about obstruction of justice, and Mueller reportedly insisted on getting a chance to ask the president follow-ups as well.\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that as Trump was preparing to replace Sessions with Whitaker, the president had already begun reviewing the answers his lawyers had put together to send back to the special counsel.\n\nIt's unclear whether Mueller will accept the answers as is without pressing for an in-person interview.\n\nIf the special counsel wants to subpoena the president, he would need to get permission to do so from Whitaker. The Post reported that Whitaker would reject such a request.\n\nAs the person in charge of the investigation, Whitaker will also have final say on whether or not to make Mueller's report public.\n\nThe myriad questions surrounding Whitaker's independence prompted DOJ veterans and constitutional law experts to lay the groundwork for a legal argument saying Mueller could challenge Whitaker's appointment if he overruled a decision by Mueller.\n\nAttorneys Neal Katyal and George Conway wrote in a New York Times op-ed that because a \"principal officer\" of the US must be confirmed by the Senate, \"President Trump's installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of [former Attorney General] Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional.

Battery lives, that is.\n\nGoogle backed up the battery life benefits of \"dark mode\" on operating systems and apps in a presentation during the company's Android Dev Summit on Thursday.\n\nDark mode is an option that changes the overall color theme of an operating system or app to the color black. It's long been associated with better battery life on devices, especially mobile devices. Nevertheless, the benefits of dark mode are now officially endorsed by Google, one of the most influential tech companies in the world.\n\nIn one piece of data, Google showed how dark mode can use 43% less power at full brightness than \"normal mode\" in the YouTube app, which uses a lot of white.\n\nGoogle\n\nFunnily enough, Google acknowledged that it had made a mistake in encouraging app developers to use the color white for their apps, including Google's own apps. Unfortunately, it's led to an inconsistent experience on mobile devices. You can turn on dark mode for the Android operating system and various apps that offer dark mode, but other apps that don't offer dark mode will use color white as the main color theme.\n\nThe battery-saving effects of dark modes are also more apparent on OLED displays, which most top smartphones use these days, compared to more traditional LCD displays. OLED displays don't shine their pixels when displaying the color black. In essence, pixels displaying the color black are actually turned off and are using very little power \u2014 if any. LCD displays, on the other hand, have a backlight that's always shining, even when displaying the color black.\n\nBattery life is certainly a major reason for every operating system and app developer to offer dark mode. But for me, it's mostly about comfort. It's an incredibly jarring experience to use apps in dark mode, only to switch to an app without dark mode and get suddenly blasted with white light. It's especially noticeable when using mobile devices in dark environments.\n\nPerhaps we'll see more apps getting the dark mode option in the near future. I'm especially rooting for website developers to give the option to give their websites a dark mode, too.", "Lucy McBath, a progressive Democrat and gun control activist whose son was shot and killed in 2012, pulled out a narrow win in a red Georgia district on Thursday.\n\nMcBath beat GOP Rep.

Disney revealed a logo for the service on Thursday:\n\nDisney\n\nIger said a Loki TV series is in development for the service with Tom Hiddleston reprising his role, confirming a Variety report that Disney is making shows spinning off of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nA new \"Star Wars\" live-action TV series is also being developed that will be a prequel to \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" starring Diego Luna as his \"Rogue One\" character, Cassian Andor. The series will be a \"spy thriller\" that \"follows the adventures of rebel spy Cassian Andor during the formative years of the Rebellion\" and will go into production next year, according to the \"Star Wars\" official website.\n\nAnother \"Star Wars\" live-action series is currently being filmed from writer and producer Jon Favreau (director of \"Iron Man\" and \"The Jungle Book\") called \"The Mandalorian.\" It will be the first live-action \"Star Wars\" TV series ever. It takes place between the original and new \"Star Wars\" trilogies, following a \"lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy.\"\n\nIger said Disney is \"in some discussions\" to gain the TV rights back to old movies, but didn't specify which. During an earnings call in August, Iger said \"a number of products\" before 2019 would be affected by licensing agreements, suggesting that the streaming service would not include Disney's full catalog at launch. Bloomberg reported at the time that Disney was trying to buy back the TV rights to old \"Star Wars\" movies from Turner Broadcasting, but negotiations had stalled.\n\nOther shows Iger touched on included an animated \"Monsters, Inc.\" series and the return of the animated \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars,\" as well as a live-action \"High School Musical\" show.\n\nExclusive movies to the service will include \"Noel,\" starring Anna Kendrick as Santa's daughter, and \"Togo,\" starring Willem Dafoe, about the 1925 serum run to Nome.\n\nBeginning in 2019, all of Disney's movies will be removed from Netflix. That still leaves the fate of the remaining Marvel Netflix series up in the air, including \"Daredevil,\" \"Jessica Jones,\" and \"The Punisher,\" which wrapped filming on its second season this year. Netflix recently canceled two of the series, \"Luke Cage\" and \"Iron Fist.\" It could be due to waning interest in the shows, but it could also be due to Disney wanting to limit competition as much as possible and complicated negotiations with Netflix.\n\nAs Disney enters the streaming war, even with all of this content and more, it will face hurdles as it takes on Netflix. A Barclays analysis released last month saw Disney's other video services, ESPN+ and Hulu (which it will own 60% of after the Fox deal closes), as \"reductive\" until it figures out pricing and bundling strategies. Furthermore, the service will be launching during what Barclays called a \"tough integration\" during the Disney-Fox merger.\n\nBut Disney also has the assets to be a formidable player.\n\nA Morgan Stanley analysis last month predicted that Disney+ would gain over 20 million subscribers by 2024 and become a $6 billion business.

The documents say that the changes won't take effect until Trump issues a proclamation. \"Consistent with our immigration laws, the President has the broad authority to suspend or restrict the entry of aliens into the United States if he determines it to be in the national interest to do so,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said in a joint statement announcing the changes.\n\nThey added: \"Today, we are using the authority granted to us by Congress to bar aliens who violate a Presidential suspension of entry or other restriction from asylum eligibility.\"\n\nThe changes come as multiple caravans of thousands of migrants remain in Mexico, grappling over what route to take to the US-Mexico border. Many of the caravan members have said they intend to seek asylum in the US, though it's unclear whether they plan to request it after crossing the border illegally or after reaching a legal port of entry.\n\nImmigration and civil liberties advocates have repeatedly said the Trump administration's efforts will contravene domestic and international law, which allow migrants to seek asylum no matter how they enter.\n\n\"US law specifically allows individuals to apply for asylum whether or not they are at a port of entry. It is illegal to circumvent that by agency or presidential decree,\" Omar Jadwat of the American Civil Liberties Union said Thursday in a statement.\n\nRead more: Trump rages against migrant caravans in long, bizarre press conference, vows to bar asylum claims from people who cross the border illegally\n\nIn a briefing with reporters Thursday afternoon, senior administration officials said the changes were an attempt to \"funnel\" credible asylum claims through the ports of entry, where border officials would be better equipped to handle the volume.\n\nThe senior administration officials also called the current asylum system \u2014 which is currently backlogged with roughly 800,000 cases \u2014 a \"full-fledged and very large crisis.\"\n\nThey argued that the changes would reduce the amount of illegitimate asylum claims, paving the way for legitimate asylum-seekers to get a fair hearing.\n\n\"It's important just to remind people that those who enter between the ports of entry are knowingly and voluntarily breaking the law.

Based on their review, ethics officials would make a recommendation, but Whitaker would not be legally required to follow it.\n\nWhitaker, a former US attorney from the Southern District of Iowa, is viewed by many as a staunch Trump loyalist.\n\nThe New York Times reported in September that the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, once described Whitaker as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the DOJ, which is investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to tilt the 2016 election in his favor.\n\nWhitaker appears to share the White House's skepticism of Mueller and the Russia investigation. Shortly before he was hired as Sessions' chief of staff last year, Whitaker wrote in an op-ed article for CNN that Mueller had \"come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\"\n\nWhitaker added that his concerns stemmed from reports that the special counsel was investigating the Trump Organization's financial records. Mueller's scrutiny of Trump's finances \"falls completely outside of the realm\" of his appointment, Whitaker wrote.\n\nBut in a letter outlining the scope of Mueller's appointment last year, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein gave Mueller broad authority to not only investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated\" with Trump's campaign, but examine \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\n\nRosenstein also gave Mueller the power to investigate \"any other matters within the scope\" of the law outlining a special counsel's jurisdiction, including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\n\nWhitaker was also the chairman of Trump associate Sam Clovis' 2013 campaign for Iowa state treasurer. Clovis went on to work as a senior Trump campaign adviser during the 2016 election and is also a witness in Mueller's investigation.\n\nSubpoena wars\n\nMueller would reportedly be blocked by Whitaker if he tried to subpoena Trump. Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, where a presidential subpoena is concerned, if Whitaker were to reject Mueller's request for one, it could dramatically alter his ability to get to the bottom of several investigative threads surrounding Trump.\n\nMueller's team has been wrangling with Trump's lawyers for almost a year over the terms of a presidential interview.\n\nTrump's lawyers have repeatedly blocked Mueller's requests, but the two sides agreed to a first round of questions to which Trump's lawyers would provide written answers to inquiries about collusion, but not about obstruction of justice. Mueller agreed but reportedly insisted on getting a chance to ask the president follow-ups as well.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN reported that as Trump was preparing to replace Sessions with Whitaker, the president had already begun reviewing the answers his lawyers had put together to send back to the special counsel.\n\nIt's unclear whether Mueller will accept the answers as is without pressing for an in-person interview. Trump's lead defense lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told Insider in August that if Mueller subpoenas Trump, his lawyers would \"would move to quash the subpoena.\" He added at the time that they were \"pretty much finished with our memorandum opposing a subpoena.\"\n\nA presidential subpoena would likely kick off a lengthy constitutional battle that would go all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nCurrent DOJ policy states that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Trump's lawyers have argued that if he cannot be indicted, he also cannot be subpoenaed.\n\nDOJ veterans and Mueller's former associates have described him as a by-the-books prosecutor, adding that he is unlikely to go against DOJ guidelines on the issue of indictment.\n\nBut the move may not be completely off the table.\n\nIn May, The Washington Post reported that during a negotiation in March, Mueller threatened to subpoena Trump to testify before a grand jury if he did not agree to a voluntary interview.\n\nThree previous US presidents have been subpoenaed. Roland Riopelle, a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney, told Insider in September that based on past legal precedent, he believes that if Trump \"gets subpoenaed ... the court will issue an order for him to appear before the grand jury.\"\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this month, Nelson Cunningham, a former federal prosecutor and Senate and White House aide, laid out compelling alternative evidence in Politico of his belief that Mueller may have already subpoenaed the president.\n\nThe clues, Cunningham wrote, lie in a series of under-the-radar moves at the Washington, DC, district court and circuit court of appeals by lawyers working for Mueller and an unknown witness in the investigation.\n\n\"If Mueller were going to subpoena the president \u2014 and there's every reason why a careful and thorough prosecutor would want the central figure on the record on critical questions regarding his knowledge and intent \u2014 this is just the way we would expect him to do so,\" Cunningham wrote.\n\nBenjamin Wittes, a national security expert and the editor-in-chief of Lawfare, noted that while he wasn't certain Cunningham was right, \"he advances a very interesting and plausible theory \u2014 and supports it well.\"\n\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump's defense lawyers, denied Politico's story on Wednesday, telling The New York Times there was \"no subpoena issued and there is no litigation.\"\n\nTrump later told reporters the same.", "Worst case scenario, it's possible that you could go to jail.

The Cowboys have a 3-5 record on the season and rank 29th in net total yards despite boasting offensive weapons such as quarterback Dak Prescott, running back Ezekiel Elliot, and newly-acquired wide receiver Amari Cooper. In their most recent loss, the Cowboys jumped out to an early lead on the Tennessee Titans but went completely cold in the second half to lose by 14.\n\nSeven-year-old superfan Rylan Wood stayed up as late as he could to watch the Monday Night Football game, but he had to go to bed so he could wake up for second grade the following morning. When he woke up and learned that Dallas had lost the game, Wood was so fed up with his team's efforts that he decided to pen a brutal letter to long-time owner Jerry Jones.\n\n\"He told me, 'If the Cowboys lose, I really want to write a letter,'\" Wood's mother, Kayla Jimenez, told USA Today's Matt Howerton. \"He told me that he wanted to write a letter to Jerry Jones.\"\n\nAnd so he did. Wood came home from school and began scrawling a frustrated message on behalf of Cowboys fans everywhere. When Wood announced he had completed the letter, Jimenez posted the finished product to her Facebook page before sending it off in the mail.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Jones,\n\nMy name is Rylan Wood. I am a 7-year-old 2nd grade student in Mansfield, Texas. My family has been Dallas Cowboys fans since the team was started. I have a lot of Cowboy gear and I have met 'Zeke, Taco, Jason Witten and two other players who play on other teams.\n\nYou have made my mom very mad because WE SUCK!

I do not want to hurt your feelings.\n\nThank you,\n\nRylan\"\n\nLike Wood, fans have increasingly criticized Jason Garrett and called on Jones to part ways with his nine-year head coach. Throughout the season, Garrett has come under fire for cautious playcalling that has cost the Cowboys games on numerous occasions. Perhaps trading a future first-round draft pick for Amari Cooper was meant to spark the team heading into the second half of the season, but Dallas has still fallen flat even him on the field.\n\n\"He's saying what everyone is thinking,\" Jimenez said. \"I laughed and laughed before I posted it.\"", "Update: With white, Caruana got into some dangerous territory after Carlsen played into the Rossolimo variation of the Sicilian Defense in Game 1. The Sicilian gives black winning chances, and Carlsen had an edge in the mid-game, while a nervous Caruana got himself into time trouble. Carlsen missed some chances, and Caruana salvaged a draw. The score now stands a 0.5-0.5, with 11 classical games remaining.\n\nIt's been a long, long, long, long wait. Very, very, very long. But for the first time since American Bobby Fischer defeated Boris Spassky of the USSR in 1972, an American is competing for the World Chess Championship.\n\nMiami-born, Brooklyn-raised Fabiano Caruana won the Candidates Tournament earlier this year and will take on three-time world champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway in London. The match commences on Friday, and as was the case for the 2016 WCC \u2014 won by Carlsen over Russian challenger Sergey Karjakin in New York \u2014 it will run for 12 rounds, with tie-breaks in the event of an equal result after the classical games. (Carlsen will begin with the black pieces in Game 1.)\n\nChampion and challenger are the world Nos. 1 and 2 players, by the FIDE rating system: Carlsen stands at 2835; Caruana at 2832. They're nearly the same age. But Carlsen, at 27, has ruled the chess world for years. Caruana, 26, has long been considered a likely WCC contender, but despite some spectacular results, his road to London has been uneven. (He also used to be officially affiliated with Italy, and he holds dual US-Italian citizenship.)\n\nWhen I spoke with him before the Sinquefield Cup, a major tournament in St. Louis, a few months back, he reminded me that his loss at the 2016 Candidates could be attributed to effectively running out of energy.

FIDE\n\nCaruana has a solid record against Carlsen (although Carlsen has more victories). Most recently, at the Sinquefield Cup, Caruana pulled out a stunning draw in a flat-lost position with black, dismaying Carlsen who had taken a moment to leave the board and record a short, silent, taunting video in a private \"confessional\" booth. Ultimately, Caruana shared a three-way tie for first at the event, with Carlsen and Armenia's Levon Aronian.\n\nCarlsen struggled against Karjakin in 2016, needing the shorter tiebreaks to notch his third title. Against Caruana, he'll face a trickier foe than he has in the past. Against Vishy Anand for his first two WCCs, he was able to blunt the older man's all-court power game with resourceful defense and a patented ability to build gradually on small advantages. Karjakin sought to suck all the life out of positions and negate Carlsen's talent for incremental domination.\n\nCaruana, by contrast, is a calculating machine. While Carlsen might consider just a few options and retain a manageable position, playing for an endgame and relying on his vaunted talent for recalling thousands of patterns, Caruana can emulate a computer analysis engine's ability to peer deeply into positions an come up with nearly inhuman resources.\n\nA very modern World Chess Championship\n\nCarlsen at the 2016 WCC.

And I believed him.\n\nAfter Fischer won the World Championship in 1972, in Iceland at the height of the Cold War, he never defended his title, descending into eccentric behavior before passing away in 2008. Caruana has in his career turned in some crushing Fisher-like performances, and he's often been compared to the legendary and infamous American prodigy regarding his play.\n\nBut it's clear he doesn't want to follow in Fischer's footsteps entirely.\n\n\"I hope to have a longer career than he did,\" Caruana said.", "Aly Song/Reuters\n\nJD.com CEO Liu Qiangdong was briefly detained in Minneapolis, Minnesota, over a rape allegation in August.\n\nSince then, he has been absent from several high-profile events in China.\n\nLiu didn't show up to the World Internet Conference on Wednesday.\n\nJD.com shares fell almost 7%.\n\nWatch JD.com trade live.\n\nJD.com, the second largest Chinese e-commerce site after Alibaba, fell nearly 7% Thursday after CEO Liu Qiangdong, who is the subject of a rape investigation in the US, didn't show up at a major state-sponsored internet conference in China.\n\nLiu was absent from the World Internet Conference, which opened Wednesday in Wuzhen, China.

Until recently, however, they haven't been noted for around-corners race-track performance.\n\nThe company was aware of this and so for the Model 3 sedan, it developed a new feature called \"Track Mode.\" I first heard about when I tested out a Performance version of the Model 3 earlier this year, but it wasn't yet ready for prime time.\n\nNow it is. \"With Track Mode, which is designed specifically for use on closed autocross circuits and racetracks, our goal was simple: use that same motor power and torque to make cornering on the track feel just as natural as forward acceleration,\" Tesla said on its website.\n\nAfter considerable testing and tweaking \u2014 including enlisting tame race-car driver and Motor Trend throttle jockey Randy Pobst \u2014 Tesla has released Track Mode into the wild. Tesla celebrated the achievement with a very informative blog post about the bonkers performance boost that managed to make it all seem like a completely arid engineering experiment. Sample: \"By precisely controlling whether torque goes to the front or the rear wheels, Model 3's dual motors can immediately and silently increase or decrease the car's rotation in a corner at your request.\"\n\nFun stuff! Tesla\n\nLuckily, the wordsmiths at Motor Trend crashed the party at Willow Springs, a track near Los Angeles. Their stylings were more in line with what enthusiasts might appreciate.\n\nWith Pobst's input, the Track Mode-equipped Model 3 was a stunner, posting a 1:21.49 lap time. That \"snips a lifetime-like 1.29 seconds from Randy's recent lap in the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio,\" Motor Trend wrote.\n\n\"The new time essentially matches a 2016 Porsche Cayman GT4 and even beats a former Best Driver's Car winner, the 2011 Ferrari 458 Italia (1:22.30). Until the new BMW M3 shows up, that perches the Model 3 atop the podium as the world's quickest sport sedan\u2014at least around this track.\"\n\nRead More: I tried Tesla's new Autopilot feature that helps navigate during highway driving to see if it's helpful \u2014 here's the verdict\n\nIn a nutshell, Track Mode in a dual-motor Tesla destabilizes an otherwise very stable machine, while also adding cooling to the powertrain, which needs it to avoid overheating. While you would expect a combination of two motors, antilock braking, and traction/stability control to keep a Performance Model 3 more or less glued to the tarmac under spirited piloting, Track Mode sends the nanny home.\n\nThe result, to my eye (Tesla and Motor Trend each posted videos), is a Model 3 that wants to dart into corners, nail the apex and power out with some juicy oversteer, as power is vectored to the rear wheels. Fun stuff! As you can see from the screen grabs in this post, nice, juicy plumes of incinerated Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires can now be conjured, a la \"Top Gear.\"\n\nCan't wait to strap on my helmet and take a crack at \"simultaneously [applied] brake and motor torque to produce a net increase in tractive force while cornering.\"\n\nI'm kidding, Elon. Track Mode sounds brilliant and is just what a lot of Tesla owners have been asking for.", "Earlier this month Tesla blew its third-quarter earnings out of the water.\n\nAs CEO Elon Musk promised, for the third time in the company's history it posted a profit.\n\nNet income was $311.5 million.\n\nRevenue hit $6.8 billion, up 70% from the previous quarter.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, the company generated $881 million in free cash flow.\n\nMusk promised that these numbers indicate the start of a new era at Tesla \u2014 an era in which the company would be profitable every quarter. That promise has Wall Street picking through the numbers to see if perennial profitability is possible for a company that has yet to turn an annual profit.\n\nAnd Tesla's balance sheet leaves many reasons to be skeptical. With its $7.9 billion in assets still swallowed by $9.7 billion in liabilities; with a massive debt bill coming due in March; and with commitments to start all kinds of capital-intensive projects floating around, Tesla will need a lot of money.\n\nWhat's more, on Wall Street, accounting is as much an art as it is a science. A really talented numbers-smith can make a smash hit out of a quarter that might otherwise have sounded sound like a flop. You just have to pay really close attention to what's really music, and what's just noise.\n\nThe noise\n\nNow for the noise in Tesla's quarterly report.\n\nFirst and most simply, Tesla got what UBS called \"some unexpected help\" by selling $137.2 million in non-ZEV regulatory credits to traditional automakers. It also sold $52.3 million in ZEV credits, bringing its total profits due to credits up to $189.5 million.\n\nTesla also went incredibly lean for the quarter. Research and development fell from 11% of sales to 5%, despite the fact that Musk has said that a Tesla Roadster, a Semi, a Model Y, and a pickup truck are in the works. Tesla also lowered the cash it keeps on hand for warranties from $2,913 per car in Q2 to $2,249 per car in Q3, according to UBS.\n\nThe company reported a 103% jump in receivables for the quarter and mentioned this little ditty, which shows you a little bit about how that happens (from the quarterly report):\n\nAs of September 30, 2018, one entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2017, no entity represented 10% of our total accounts receivable balance.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson said the quarter ended on a Sunday and said that entity is one of Tesla's partner banks, which had issued a large receivable to Tesla for customer loans for cars delivered over the weekend. That cash was then distributed during the first few days of Q4.\n\nAnd one more head-scratcher. Tesla reclassified $72.8 million of finished goods inventory as property, plant and equipment (PP&E). They reasoned this saying it was a \"decision to utilize some of our fleet cars as service loaners on a long-term basis.\"\n\nOne investor pointed out to Business Insider that if you add that $72.8 million back to finished-goods inventory, Tesla's Q3 finished goods would be $8 million higher than its Q2 finished goods inventory. In Q2, finished goods hit about $1.72 billion. In Q3 (with the add back), it's about $1.73 billion.\n\nThis is odd because Tesla delivered more cars than it produced in Q3, so the number of finished goods on its books should decline compared to the quarter before.\n\nIs enough enough?\n\nAll of these questions are about the past \u2014 about what happened in Q3 \u2014 but Tesla's balance sheet also leaves questions about its future. The company said it expects capital expenditures to come in just under $2.5 billion in 2018 and between $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion annually for 2019 and 2020.\n\n\"Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2018 are expected to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory 1 and the Tesla Factory, and for building additional stores, service centers and Superchargers, as well as the cost to acquire land use rights and our initial design and other expenditures for our planned Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai. We expect total 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly below $2.5 billion.\"\n\nAnd, of course, there are all the new models Tesla wants to build (mentioned above).\n\nThese are pretty ambitious plans for relatively flat capital expenditures, especially while Panasonic, the company that makes Tesla's batteries, told investors on its Q3 call that it's seeing major US tariff risks ahead that could jack up prices. Tesla has $3 billion in cash, but it also has $3.5 billion in accounts payable.\n\nIn other words, to invest heavily in its expansion, Tesla still needs to generate even more cash than it has. The company says its cash levels should remain pretty flat over the next year or two, though.\n\nAnd, of course, there's the $920 million debt payment it needs to make in March.\n\nThis doesn't have to stop Tesla by any means. Musk can go raise some money from investors, but he's said repeatedly that he won't do that.\n\nWhich brings us to another, final question: Why not?", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nReformation Facebook\n\nIt's hard to find cashmere that deserves to be called \"conscious\" or sustainable. In fact, a lot of people would say it's hard to find because it does not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 exist. The process of creating cashmere is so inherently detrimental \u2014 requiring lots of resources, and incurring lots of environmental degradation \u2014 that it can't be had in a way that isn't harmful.\n\nThe problem for all of us would-be conscious shoppers is that cashmere also happens to feel like you're being hugged by a cloud every time you move. It's warm, it's soft, it's cozy \u2014 it somehow feels like the first moment you ever really feel warm after a chilly day outdoors put on a never-ending loop. In other words, it's impossibly pleasant, and the demand is understandably high. But that demand has led to dangerous overgrazing in Mongolia, and it's turning grasslands we need into deserts.\n\nThe imperfectly perfect solution is to recycle the cashmere we already have on earth, rather than creating more. It's a sustainable logic many retail startups are adopting\u2014 phasing out virgin materials and swapping in ready-made alternatives. Everlane's Renew outerwear is one example.\n\nFor cashmere, that's Reformation's Conscious Cashmere line. Each sweater is made of 70% repurposed, regenerated cashmere clippings. It feels the same, costs about the same ($148) but has markedly less impact on the environment. On average, one kilogram (about two pounds) of recycled cashmere has 80% less of the environmental impact than conventional cashmere.\n\nThe Cashmere Crew is a hip-length, relaxed-fit sweater that comes in four colors: grey, ochre (seen above), black, and Malibu stripe ($148). Reformation\n\nReformation's conscious cashmere is limited but covers the classics: crews, cropped crews, cardigans, boyfriend sweaters, and boxy sweaters\u2014 all priced at $148. Fisherman sweaters are priced at $228. Colors range from one to five options per style, and most are classics like tan, black, pink, ochre, grey, and green with some striped patterns in the mix.\n\nI personally have the Cropped Double V Cardigan ($148), and it's about what you'd expect from any other Reformation piece: an elevated classic that's a little cooler than you remember cropped cardigans being. It's slim-fitting with a double V-neck and V-back, and it's cropped so you can tuck it into a pair of high-waisted jeans without an excess of material. The cashmere is thick and lends enough rigidity to look appropriately slimming while still being cozy. In other words, it's pretty great. It would be great regardless of being made from 70% recycled cashmere, but that's the figure that makes me feel more justified about spending $140+ on it.\n\nThe Cropped Double V Cardigan has a v-neck and v-back and comes in black and tan for $148. Reformation\n\nTo be blunt, though, it's an imperfect solution. If 70% is recycled, that means 30% is still conventional cashmere from Mongolia. While offset by recycled materials, nothing truly \"new\" is ever as sustainable as something not new. And though the company has stated they're currently working on their traceability initiatives to ensure the supply chain is ethical, it seems they are not in place as of fall 2018.\n\nBut make no mistake: Reformation's 'conscious cashmere' line is still exciting. It's a have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too option that the average person can appreciate, and would probably still want to buy ignorant to any hint of sustainability ethos.\n\nRather than convincing everyone to swear off cashmere, Reformation's recycled cashmere makes it so that their most desirable options (stylish, of-the-moment clothes from an \"it girl\" brand with a cult-following) are some of the most sustainable on the market. It may not be perfect, but it's a good solution for now. And, best of all, the cashmere is just as good as anything else on the site.", "Just because you're an inexperienced traveler doesn't mean you have to pack your suitcase like one.

Only half the promised 20,000 new Velibs are currently in operation.\n\nUnlike Velib bikes, which are rented on an hourly basis and must be docked in roadside stations after use, Veligo bikes will stay with users, who can rent them for 40 euros a month, half of which can be subsidized by their employers.\n\nThe initiative is a major move for Valerie Pecresse, the conservative head of the Ile-de-France region, who often clashes with Paris's leftist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, over environment and transport issues.\n\n\"Electric bicycles have an enormous potential. They are an efficient and ecological way to get to the railway station for short commutes that can replace the car,\" said Pecresse.\n\nSEE ALSO: US imposes new sanctions on Russia to punish Moscow's human rights abuses and illegal annexation\n\nShe said Veligo would allow commuters to try out e-bikes and might convince them to buy their own. A good e-bike costs 1,500-2,000 euros. Around 250,000 were sold in France last year, compared to 2.7 million regular bikes, IDFM said.\n\nWhile Velib mainly serves the two million residents of central Paris, Veligo is aimed at the capital's wider region, home to 10 million people and a third of national output.\n\nVelib already offers some e-bikes and in recent months several firms, including California's Lime and Bird, have launched electric scooters that have taken Paris by storm.\n\nReporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Luke Baker", "California chickens will soon all be getting more space. One square foot of it, to be exact.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in California overwhelmingly approved Proposition 12, which will enact stricter rules on how much space farmers must give to egg-laying hens, veal calves, and breeding pigs. The idea is that all of those animals should have enough room to stretch out their wings, claws, and paws.\n\nThe measure has major ramifications for the rest of the country, because it also means that grocers in California won't be able to sell any meat or eggs that come from out of state and don't adhere to the new regulations. That means farms across the US that want to sell their wares in the nation's most populous state will be forced to comply with California's new rule.\n\nVadim Ghirda/AP\n\nCalifornia already had a law on the books about cruelty-free eggs: it says egg-laying hens, breeding pigs, and calves raised for veal must be given enough space \"to turn around freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs.\" But that still allowed for some variations based on interpretation.\n\nNow, under the new regulation, farmers have until the start of 2020 to provide each egg-laying hen at least one square foot of floor space. By 2022, all the state's hens need to have completely cage-free housing.\n\nAnimal rights activists like the Humane Society of the US, which sponsored Proposition 12, cheered the change.\n\n\"California voters have sent a loud and clear message that they reject cruel cage confinement in the meat and egg industries,\" Kitty Block, acting president and CEO of the Humane Society said in a statement. \"Millions of veal calves, mother pigs and egg-laying hens will never know the misery of being locked in a tiny cage for the duration of their lives.\"\n\nEgg producers around the country had already rallied in opposition to California's current hen-housing requirements. In April, 13 states took the battle to the Supreme Court. Iowa, the country's largest egg producer, even enacted a new law to protect farmers there who keep hens caged.\n\nBut big egg retailers like McDonalds,Costco, and Burger King had already started to respond to consumers' cage-free demands \u2014 McDonald's and Burger King have both pledged to source only cage-free eggs by 2025.\n\nThe battle over how we house farm animals comes as the US' egg appetite soars\u2014 American egg production rose 3% in 2017, with a total of 106 billion eggs produced last year.

Farmers say raising cage-free chickens can also be messier and require more work.\n\nCage-free eggs also cost more in stores. A study published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics in 2017 estimated that California's current law cut egg production in that state by more than a third. For consumers, egg prices were found to be between 9% and 33% more expensive than they would have been without the rule.\n\n\"I think it should be an issue of the person votes when they buy the eggs,\" Dennis Bowden, who converted his own chicken farm in Maine to a cage-free facility, told Pew Stateline. \"Poor people can't afford to buy eggs if they're all cage-free.\"\n\nPlus, cage-free doesn't always mean that the birds get to roam freely; some cage-free egg-layers still don't spend a single moment of their lives outside.\n\nIn addition to passing Proposition 12, Californians also voted in favor of nixing Daylight Saving Time and decided that the state should be able to spend mental-health funding to house homeless people with mental illnesses.", "Week 10 of the NFL season is here, and Cortana is back to make picks in a head-to-head showdown with Elo.\n\nWe looked at two popular systems used to pick NFL games: Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, and Elo, the modeling system used by Nate Silver's data-journalism site, FiveThirtyEight.\n\nIn both cases, the computers are picking outright winners and not against the spread.

After The New York times published an explosive story on how the company previously protected one of its star engineers, Andy Rubin, amid a sexual-misconduct investigation, Google CEO Sundar Pichai revealed the company has fired 48 employees for sexual harassment in the last two years.\n\nOn Thursday, Google published new policies for how the company will handle sexual harassment after employees staged a walkout and sent the company a list of five demands.\n\nEmployees didn't get everything they wanted, but they did get their top demand: an end to forced arbitration for sexual-harassment cases.\n\nIn a memo, Pichai announced the new policy while also defending Google's general policy of forced arbitration by claiming it never required confidentiality.\n\nRead more: Here's the memo Google CEO Sundar Pichai sent to employees on the changes to its sexual harassment policy after the walkout\n\n\"We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims. Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and arbitration still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy) but, we recognize that choice should be up to you,\" he wrote.\n\nForcing employees to sign agreements forbidding them to sue the company, and to instead go to arbitration, is one of the key ways a company can keep its dirty laundry secret.\n\nArbitration is a private process that doesn't produce public court documents or public court decisions. It can also make it more difficult for employees to band together to file class-action lawsuits.\n\nAnd settlement agreements may also include a gag order, forbidding the employee to talk about their experience, even if they won the case.\n\nMix it all together, and you get a perfect combo where a company's incentives to cover things up can seem more alluring than banishing illegal behavior or misconduct and seeing that it doesn't happen again.\n\nWith private arbitration, even if the company fires the employee (and that doesn't always happen), a new employer has no easy way to know about the underlying incident, freeing the employee to continue engaging in the same behavior at the new company.\n\nForcing employees to agree to arbitration as a condition of employment has become common practice in corporate America today. And it is standard practice in Silicon Valley. It is so common that Susan Fowler, the famed engineer who wrote about her experience with sexual harassment at Uber, argued the practice should be banned in a petition to the Supreme Court about a year ago.\n\nWhile Google clearly hasn't given up forced arbitration in general, making it optional for sexual-harassment cases is a huge step for Silicon Valley.\n\nAlone, this one company's choice won't end Silicon Valley's well-documented bro-culture problems.\n\nBut the thing is, Google isn't alone. About a year ago, Microsoft also removed its forced-arbitration clause for sexual-harassment claims and endorsed a Senate bill attempting to make such a change the law of the land.\n\nUber followed suit in May.\n\nIdeally, companies would simply stop making their employees waive their rights to sue in regular courts for every issue, not just sexual-harassment claims.\n\nBut for now, a slow-and-steady wave of change is happening on this front. Perhaps Silicon Valley can even become a beacon for other industries with well-publicized sexual-harassment issues, like media and finance, to do the same.\n\nUltimately, the freedom of employees to go public with sexual-harassment claims will shed some much-needed light on a situation that has been allowed to fester in the dark far too long.", "Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nNarrator: In 2017, researchers tested 20 best-selling US sunscreens. The good news is that 19 of them met FDA standards. The bad news? Nine of them didn't meet European standards. Turns out, different countries have different rules for what makes a safe sunscreen and US sunscreens may not be protecting Americans as well as it could. When we lay in the sun, our skin absorbs two types of UV light. UVA and UVB rays. UVB light is higher energy and can cause sunburns while UVA penetrates deeper under the skin and can damage skin cells along the bottom layer of your epidermis.\n\nDesai: We know that UVB rays are the rays that cause sunburns. But UVA rays are the rays that can actually cause skin cancer so you actually wanna cover the spectrum on both of those. I think a lot of people get into a misconception that I didn't get sunburned so I'm not at prone to getting skin cancer which really isn't true.\n\nNarrator: The biggest concern with US sunscreen is how much protection you're getting from cancer-causing UVA rays. For decades, FDA regulations required that sunscreens protect against UVB, but not necessarily against UVA. Meanwhile, rates for melanoma, a dangerous form of skin cancer, kept climbing in the US. Then, in 2012, the FDA updated its regulations on labeling and testing so that manufacturers must now let customers know if its sunscreen protects against both UVB and UVA. That's what the broad spectrum label on your sunscreen means, for example. And while this is a good first step, there's still no regulation on how much protection you're getting from UVA. So, there's no way to tell.\n\nDesai: Here in the United States, I think we need to be cognizant of the fact that when a sunscreen says it's broad spectrum, UVA- and UVB-protecting, that does mean you're going to get protection against those rays. However, what it does not mean is that it's going to block out all of the rays.\n\nNarrator: And that's where US sunscreens fall short.\n\nDesai: And I will say that I do think we are behind other countries globally, particularly some of our European counterparts, in getting new sunscreen ingredients approved. Overall, there has not been much change in US sunscreen composition and what our sunscreens are made up of in the past several years.\n\nNarrator: The FDA has approved 16 active ingredients that protect against UV radiation. But only some protect against both UVB and UVA rays. For comparison, Europe requires that all of its more than 20 active ingredients protect against both.\n\nDesai: Right now, the American Academy of Dermatology and other organizations are really advocating with the FDA that they need to really speed up the approval process for new sunscreen ingredients. Because it's with these ingredients that we can probably get even better coverage and better protection and maybe even get something that's easier to apply, that's easier on the skin, that doesn't have any harmful side effects for patients.\n\nNarrator: You can purchase sunscreens from other countries online. But if you plan on sticking with American sunscreens, look for the broad spectrum label and don't buy anything below SPF 30.\n\nDesai: The higher the SPF, definitely the better. But we definitely don't want anyone going below a 30. And think about if you're someone who has a history of a melanoma, if you use an SPF 30, you're blocking out let's say 98% of the harmful rays. However, what about the remaining 2%? That 2% may be something that could be potential of putting you at a risk down the road.", "Google is planning a major expansion in New York City, adding enough space to more than double its current workforce there, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe internet search giant is nearing a deal on an office building at St. John's Terminal on the west side of Manhattan, is planning to expand its space at Chelsea Market, which is just north of there, and is planning to develop some space at Pier 57, the Journal reported. All told, the moves would add some 1.85 million square feet of space to that controlled by the company in the city, according to the report. That's enough room for more than 12,000 workers.\n\nCurrently, the company employs about 7,000 workers in New York City.\n\nA Google representative declined to comment on the report.\n\nThe biggest piece that the company plans to add to its New York real estate puzzle is the planned office building at St. John's terminal, according to the Journal. That building, expected to be completed by 2022, will have 1.3 million square feet of space, or enough for about 8,500 workers, according to the Journal. Google is nearing an agreement through which it would either buy or lease the building, according to the report.\n\nGoogle has a long history in New York\n\nThe company purchased Chelsea Market in March for $2.4 billion. Google is planning to add about 300,000 square feet to the property, the Journal reported. It previously had announced plans to lease some 250,000 square feet of space in nearby Pier 57. Those two projects would give it enough room for more than 3,500 workers.\n\nGoogle bought Chelsea Market in March but has maintained office space there since 2008. Gryffindor/Wikimedia Google has had a presence in the city since 2000, when it opened a sales office there. It established its main office in the city at 111 Eighth Avenue in 2006 and bought that building in 2010. It's been using space in the Chelsea Market next door since 2008.\n\nRead this: Amazon reportedly plans to set up 2 different locations for its HQ2 \u2014 in New York and Virginia\n\nThe company's New York workforce includes representatives of a broad swath of its business, including its engineering, product, and business operations groups.\n\nThe report about Google expansion follows the Journal's report earlier this week that Amazon, one of the search giant's chief rivals, is planning on opening up a large satellite office in Long Island City in Queens as part of its effort to establish a second headquarters, or HQ2.\n\nNow read:", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Previously, the card earned 3x points per dollar spent in your choice of one out of five possible categories and 2x points on the remaining four categories, on up to $100,000 per year. You'd also earn 1x point on everything else.\n\nThe new card offers a new earning structure, awarding 4x points on your choice of two categories instead of one, on up to $150,000 per year. You can also get 25% of your points back when you redeem them for a flight through American Express Travel, for up to 250,000 points back per year.\n\nHowever, unlike the previous Business Gold Rewards card, the new Business Gold Card does not offer a new member bonus. Previously, the card offered 50,000 points when you spent $5,000 in the first three months.\n\nInstead of a bonus, new card members can get up to one year of free subscriptions to Google GSuite Basic services for up to three users, as well as ZipRecruiter Standard. For some business owners, this could be much more valuable than the old welcome bonus; the year of free services is valued by AmEx at $3,188.\n\nOf course, the value of the free year only applies to business owners who would otherwise be paying for those services; if you get access to them through another benefit, if a parent company pays for them, or if you typically invoice them to clients, then this will clearly be less valuable than the bonus points would be.\n\nThe new Business Gold Card is also raising its annual fee to $295. Previously, the Business Gold Rewards was $175, waived the first year. Depending on your business' spending, and the value you can get from the free services, this could be easy to justify.\n\nIf you're looking for an AmEx business card card that does come with a sizable welcome bonus, you'll be better off considering the Business Platinum\u00ae Card from American Express. That card offers up to 75,000 AmEx points \u2014 50,000-points after spending $10,000 in the first three months after opening a new account. You'll earn 25,000 more points after spending an additional $10,000 on purchases in the same period. You can read our full review of the card here.\n\nIf that's too hefty of a minimum spending requirement, you may want to look to Chase instead. The Chase Ink Business Preferred offers a tremendous 80,000 point sign-up bonus when you spend $5,000 in the first three months. That's worth at least $800 as cash, $1,000 when used to book travel through Chase, and potentially much more when transferred to frequent flyer partners.

Last week, he broke down the filters the company is using to sort out exactly which chains would be a good fit.\n\n\"The easy thing would be to say, well, look, our stock is really undervalued, let's just buy a bunch of stock,\" Joyce said. \"That's not the company I want to work in. And that's not the company anyone else wants to work in.\"\n\nTo keep employees engaged and grow shareholders' returns, Joyce believes Dine Brands needs to reinvest in growth. And that means acquiring new brands.\n\n\"When I started at Choice [Hotels, where Joyce was CEO from 2008 to 2017], I had nine brands. When I left, there were 13,\" Joyce said. \"When I started, they were less than 5,000 hotels. When I left, there were over 7,000. That's pretty fun. And we can do the same thing here.\"\n\nHere's what Joyce says he's looking for in chains Dine Brands is targeting for acquisition:\n\n1. Mass appeal\n\nIHOP and Applebee's are far from cutting-edge when it comes to trends. While Joyce wants the new chain to be more up-and-coming than casual or family dining, the brand still needs to be mainstream enough to win over a significant portion of the American public.\n\nDine Brands' newest chain will likely be a hit that's trendier than Applebee's but still has mass appeal. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\n2. Ability to expand to 1,000 locations\n\nDine Brands is eyeing concepts that have 75 to 100 locations, but with the potential to grow to 10 times that size.\n\n\"I'm not going to go if it's not mass appeal,\" Joyce said. \"If we can't get to 1,000 units, it doesn't do us any good.\"\n\n3. A certain degree of trendiness\n\n\"We're looking at a lot of different brands, whether it be Mediterranean, whether it be salads, whether it be different types of cuisines that are healthier and provide mass appeal,\" Joyce said.\n\nFast-casual chains are of particular interest to Joyce. While the category, which includes chains like Chipotle and Panera Bread, has exploded over the last 10 years, the fast-casual business is a very small percentage of the overall restaurant industry.\n\n\"Casual dining is a big segment. Family dining is a big segment. Fast casual is teeny,\" Joyce said. \"We all spend all our time talking about it, but it's not the restaurant business.\"\n\nHowever, with the right brand, Joyce feels there is an opportunity for Dine Brands to change that \u2014 and potentially become the dominant player in the fast-casual industry.\n\n4. The right team\n\nDine Brands is looking for brands that already have franchisees that will stick around and help the chain continue to grow after an acquisition. In general, Joyce has emphasized the importance of building a collaborative culture at Dine Brands over the last year. The new brand's leadership team would have to fit into this culture.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be part of something different, right?\" Joyce said. \"They don't want to be part of some elaborate corporate empire that doesn't feel or bleed or breathe. Everybody \u2026 wants to feel like they've got a role.\"", "Neglected for decades, underground caves in a small village in France's Somme valley contain a treasure trove of hundreds of engravings by World War I Canadian and British soldiers as they sought refuge from German assaults.\n\nMost of the inscriptions date back to 1916, many from July of that year when the Battle of the Somme started.\n\nNearly 20,000 British soldiers were killed on the first day; by the battle's end in mid-November, the two sides had together suffered over a million casualties.\n\nWar researchers say the engravings in the chalky rocks of Bouzincourt offer a powerful insight into the thoughts of those caught up in the Somme Offensive, one of the bloodiest battles in world history.\n\nCheck them out below.", "I've had a passion for learning languages ever since I was a child.\n\nThe first one I taught myself was French.

Some employees and partners see Verma as part of the reason for the company's dysfunctional culture, and the rich compensation package is seen as an example of Apttus not taking the issues seriously enough, according to several sources Business Insider spoke to.\n\nNeither Verma nor Salesforce responded to a request for comment.\n\nApttus had been valued as high as $1.6 billion before it was acquired by Thoma Bravo. The startup raised $400 million over the years from big-name backers like Salesforce Ventures, whose parent company, Salesforce, has served as an important business and technology partner with Apttus in the past.\n\nNext steps at Apttus are unclear\n\nIn a letter posted on the Apttus homepage on Monday, Murphy echoed sentiments he expressed in the all-hands meeting. The letter is short on specifics, but Murphy wrote that he is committed to \"improving the areas where Apttus may have fallen short.\"\n\n\"We are dedicated to building an internal culture that promotes transparency, inclusion and cultivates a passion for customer success,\" Murphy wrote.\n\nBut for many employees, sources said, improving Apttus means changing up its management team.\n\nFormer Apttus CEO Kirk Krappe. Apttus Thoma Bravo has brought in several new executives, including a new chief financial officer, corporate controller, vice president of finance, and chief people officer. However, two cofounders and longtime allies of Krappe remain in the office of the CEO: Neehar Giri as president and Kent Perkocha as chief customer officer.\n\nKrappe's departure in July, Business Insider reported, followed a settlement with a former employee who accused him of sexual assault during a company retreat in Cabo.\n\nThough Verma joined the company in 2017, sources told Business Insider that he quickly grew into a contentious figure with both employees and partners alike. A recent letter sent to Murphy by a former employee upon his resignation singled out Verma as the root of many of the problems at the company.\n\n\"As a human being, you only can take so much of this brutality and for me, I chose not to be a part of a company where employees are devalued, bullied, and treated like dirt,\" Kyle Bouchard wrote in the letter, which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\n\"Why would a man who has ruined a company deserve this?\" Bouchard wrote in reference to Verma's contract.\n\nThe $26.5 million parachute\n\nThe parachute packages were listed in a document sent to Apttus shareholders around the time of Thoma Bravo's acquisition. The document outlines payments that \"have, will, or may be paid,\" the total of which may ultimately prove to be overstated, according to the documents.\n\nA large portion of the payments are contingent on shareholder approval. It is unclear whether shareholders approved of the payments.\n\nThe parachute provisions include an array of potential payments, including potential severance packages and unvested equity awards.\n\nA golden-parachute package for Chief Operating Officer Raj Verma has become a point of contention inside the company. Apttus Since Verma joined Apttus in September 2017, the total package described includes the equity grants and options he got as part of his compensation in the 12 months before the acquisition closed on October 10.\n\nBut it also includes nearly $15.3 million in potential awards if he remains at Apttus. The document lists $7.5 million in \"parent equity awards\" \u2014 additional stock in Thoma Bravo, which will only vest if Verma meets certain performance goals, as well as $7.8 million in a \"long-term incentive pool\" grant, which is time- and performance-based and may never come to fruition.\n\nThe document is related to Section 280G of the US tax code, a regulation that allows companies and executives at private companies to avoid some tax penalties if they put pay packages of a certain size up to a shareholder vote.\n\nVerma has the highest parachute package, at $26.5 million \u2014 with $25.3 million of it contingent on shareholder approval, according to the document. In addition to accelerated vesting on his existing equity, Verma has an $865,000 severance package that will go into effect if he is terminated by Thoma Bravo within 12 months of the October acquisition.\n\nJeff Santelices, chief strategy officer at the company, has a $4.7 million parachute package, Chief Marketing Officer Ben Allen has a $1.3 million package, and Chief Information Officer Praniti Lakhwara has a $1.7 million package.\n\nGot a tip about Apttus?

The Sicilian gives black winning chances, and Carlsen had an edge in the mid-game, while a nervous Caruana got himself into time trouble. Carlsen missed some chances, and Caruana salvaged a draw. The score now stands a 0.5-0.5, with 11 classical games remaining.\n\nIt's been a long, long, long, long wait. Very, very, very long. But for the first time since American Bobby Fischer defeated Boris Spassky of the USSR in 1972, an American is competing for the World Chess Championship.\n\nMiami-born, Brooklyn-raised Fabiano Caruana won the Candidates Tournament earlier this year and will take on three-time world champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway in London. The match commences on Friday, and as was the case for the 2016 WCC \u2014 won by Carlsen over Russian challenger Sergey Karjakin in New York \u2014 it will run for 12 rounds, with tie-breaks in the event of an equal result after the classical games. (Carlsen will begin with the black pieces in Game 1.)\n\nChampion and challenger are the world Nos. 1 and 2 players, by the FIDE rating system: Carlsen stands at 2835; Caruana at 2832. They're nearly the same age. But Carlsen, at 27, has ruled the chess world for years. Caruana, 26, has long been considered a likely WCC contender, but despite some spectacular results, his road to London has been uneven. (He also used to be officially affiliated with Italy, and he holds dual US-Italian citizenship.)\n\nWhen I spoke with him before the Sinquefield Cup, a major tournament in St. Louis, a few months back, he reminded me that his loss at the 2016 Candidates could be attributed to effectively running out of energy. He corrected that in 2018.\n\nRead more: 2018 is going to be a very big year in chess as Magnus Carlsen goes for a World Championship 4-peat\n\nFighting back against the World Champion\n\nMagnus Carlsen in London. FIDE\n\nCaruana has a solid record against Carlsen (although Carlsen has more victories). Most recently, at the Sinquefield Cup, Caruana pulled out a stunning draw in a flat-lost position with black, dismaying Carlsen who had taken a moment to leave the board and record a short, silent, taunting video in a private \"confessional\" booth. Ultimately, Caruana shared a three-way tie for first at the event, with Carlsen and Armenia's Levon Aronian.\n\nCarlsen struggled against Karjakin in 2016, needing the shorter tiebreaks to notch his third title. Against Caruana, he'll face a trickier foe than he has in the past. Against Vishy Anand for his first two WCCs, he was able to blunt the older man's all-court power game with resourceful defense and a patented ability to build gradually on small advantages. Karjakin sought to suck all the life out of positions and negate Carlsen's talent for incremental domination.\n\nCaruana, by contrast, is a calculating machine. While Carlsen might consider just a few options and retain a manageable position, playing for an endgame and relying on his vaunted talent for recalling thousands of patterns, Caruana can emulate a computer analysis engine's ability to peer deeply into positions an come up with nearly inhuman resources.\n\nA very modern World Chess Championship\n\nCarlsen at the 2016 WCC.

As usual, the world is hoping for some thrilling games, but with these two, there's liable to be a lot of draws, especially if they stick to Grandmaster openings, such as the Berlin Defense in the Ruy Lopez or the Queen's Gambit Declined.\n\n\"Magnus is difficult to beat,\" Caruana told me. \"He makes the most of every chance he has, and he wills things into being. \"\n\nBut in the three or four conversations I've enjoyed with Caruana over the years, in our most recent I sensed a much more confident competitor.\n\n\"When I'm on form, I can play better than Magnus,\" he said. And I believed him.\n\nAfter Fischer won the World Championship in 1972, in Iceland at the height of the Cold War, he never defended his title, descending into eccentric behavior before passing away in 2008. Caruana has in his career turned in some crushing Fisher-like performances, and he's often been compared to the legendary and infamous American prodigy regarding his play.\n\nBut it's clear he doesn't want to follow in Fischer's footsteps entirely.\n\n\"I hope to have a longer career than he did,\" Caruana said.", "You have that perfectly professional photo for LinkedIn. It's well-lit, you're smiling, there's no spinach in your teeth. It all screams, \"Hire me.\"\n\nJust one problem: it's a selfie.

Good framing means it's symmetrical and fills the circular frame on LinkedIn. A well-lit photo doesn't have weird filters, and there's adequate contrast between the subject and background. And good resolution means the photo isn't blurry.\n\nWith all of that to keep in mind, it might be tempting to just hire a professional.

All employees, regardless of seniority, are eligible to use their wages to purchase shares.\n\nEssilor, a $49 billion company that recently merged with eyewear maker Luxottica, matches each employee's investment up to a certain amount, which depends on the country where they work.\n\nAccording to Essilor's CEO and chairman, Hubert Sagni\u00e8res, this corporate governance model \u2014 also known as an employee stock ownership plan \u2014 is the most effective. He told Business Insider that it \"aligns the interests of the financial investors with the interests of the employees.\"\n\nIt's also the fairest model, Sagni\u00e8res said: \"The financial investors are taking risks with their money, while the employees are taking risks with their life.\" Plus, from a practical standpoint, employee shareholders have a vested interest in Essilor's performance.\n\nOwning shares of the company can give employees a say in larger decisions\n\nHolding shares as an Essilor employee not only means that you own a part of the company you work for. If you join the employee shareholders association, Valoptec, you also play a role in making key organizational decisions.\n\nValoptec members (there are currently about 10,000) are able to attend an annual meeting with Essilor leadership and vote on aspects of company strategy and human-resources policy, such as how employees are trained and managed. Each Valoptec member gets to cast one vote, regardless of how many shares they own.\n\n\"Your voices are equally important to me, so I want to give more weight to the person voting than the number of shares that they have,\" Sagni\u00e8res said.\n\nThe annual shareholders meeting (for all shareholders, not just Valoptec members) is more traditional. One share is equivalent to one vote, so the more shares you own, the more sway you have in the company.\n\nHowever, senior leaders at Essilor also meet with elected Valoptec representatives every two months, where they might discuss issues such as closing a manufacturing plant and potentially putting people out of jobs. Three Valoptec representatives also sit on Essilor's board.\n\nEmployee-owned firms may have a better survival rate than non-employee-owned firms\n\nAlthough employee-owned firms are relatively rare, Essilor isn't the only company where employees are a large group of shareholders.\n\nPublix Super Markets (a private company), for example, is owned by associates and members of the board of directors. According to Investopedia, all Publix employees receive 8.5% of their annual salary in the form of company stock, once they've been with the company for at least 12 months and worked at least 1,000 hours. The company has been on Fortune's list of the best workplaces in the US for 21 years.\n\nRead more: This regional chain just beat Trader Joe's and Kroger as America's favorite grocery store\n\nInterestingly, a New York Times article describes how Sears, which recently declared bankruptcy, once set aside 10% of pretax earnings for a retirement plan for full-time employees. By the 1950s, The Times reports, employees owned one quarter of Sears. (The company phased out this profit-sharing plan starting in the 1970s, The Times reports.)\n\nThe Times article contrasts Sears with Amazon, which in October, 2018, stopped the practice of giving two shares a year to warehouse employees.\n\nAnd while not every organization is suited to employee ownership, 2017 research conducted by Rutgers University professor Doug Kruse found that employee-owned firms tend to survive longer than similar, non-employee-owned firms. Kruse speculated that it was because employee-owned firms \"retain workers to maintain ownership culture and promote long-term productivity.\"\n\nWhat's more, Kruse found, employee-owned companies tend to have higher total compensation levels.\n\nEssilor's employee-ownership plan has its roots in the merger between two French companies, Essel and Silor, that created the company, in 1972. Essel started as a worker's cooperative.\n\nSagni\u00e8res said that employee ownership reflects Essilor's overall mission of improving people's lives \u2014 for both customers and employees. \"It's all about absolutely being clear and vocal about the overall purpose of the company,\" he said. \"It should not be lip service; it has to be totally credible.

What started out as an affordable watch startup for millennial men quickly grew into a booming business serving both men and women, with other stylish offerings like bracelets, sunglasses, and computer glasses joining the mix.\n\nOn top of that, the brand raked in over $71 million in sales last year, and was acquired by Movado Group in August of this year in a deal reportedly worth $200 million.\n\nWith the backing of one of the biggest watch brands in the world, MVMT is once again expanding its product lineup to offer its first-ever automatic watch \u2014 something that was highly requested by fans.\n\nInspired by the experimental spirit of 1960s architecture, The MVMT Arc Automatic blends the brand's signature minimal aesthetic with timeless style. Enclosed in an elegant 41mm case, the watch features a simple dial with hour markers, minute markers, a sweeping second hand, and a small date sub-dial at 6 o'clock. On the back of the case, a clear window reveals the intricacies of the Miyota 821A automatic movement.\n\nMVMT\n\nRather than using battery power like Quartz watches, automatic watches feature an oscillating weight powered by kinetic energy from natural motion of the wearer's wrist. As long as you wear the watch, your movements will be stored as power to keep it operating. I personally prefer automatic watches over Quartz watches because they don't require batteries, and are in turn more convenient and dependable.\n\nEven as a more refined option to its Quartz movement counterparts, the MVMT Arc Automatic is still affordably priced at $300. In my experience with automatic watches, it's next to impossible to find a worthwhile option for that price, so I had to see what the Arc was all about.\n\nMVMT sent me the Arc Automatic Watch in Bourbon Rose, and it proved to me that automatic watches aren't only reserved for luxury buyers with deep pockets.\n\nJust from opening the box, I could tell that MVMT paid extra attention to details that lend to a premium feel throughout. The watch comes packaged in a special edition velvet-lined collector's box, which adds to the experience and makes it feel just a little more luxurious.\n\nCompared to the flat glass used on the Rose Gold 40 Series I already own, the Arc Automatic uses a domed glass for a vintage look. It has a premium leather strap that's of the same quality as other MVMT watches (the one on I have from before has held up wonderfully over the last year and it's my most worn watch). I also like the brand's decision to use a 41mm case on the new Arc Automatic. It's not too big and not too small, so it'll look good on any guy's wrist.\n\nLeft to right: Iron Elm, Ivory Oak, Jet Noir, and Bourbon Rose. MVMT\n\nAs with any automatic watch, it is recommended to fully wind and wear the MVMT Arc Automatic every day (or at least before the power reserve empties) in order to maintain an accurate time. Even if you do let the watch die, you can quickly reset the time, wind it up, and get back to wearing it, instead of taking it to a jewelry store to get a new battery.\n\nAfter wearing the watch for about a week, it's definitely a great timepiece at $300. Granted, it's not at the same caliber as a legacy brand like Rolex or Omega, but it delivers everything you should look for in a watch \u2014 style, quality, and dependability \u2014 at a huge fraction of the cost. During my time at Insider Picks, I've had to opportunity to try automatic watches from several other startups. They were great, but given the difference in price, the MVMT Arc far exceeds them in value.\n\nIf you're looking for an entry-level automatic watch that still satisfies a luxury fix, this is the watch you want to own. Whether you're buying it for yourself or as a holiday gift, the MVMT Arc Automatic is a great choice.", "Jay Walder, a transportation expert who has helmed New York City's transit agency and the US' largest bike share operators, is joining Virgin Hyperloop One as the startup seeks to shift its image from futuristic tech company to mass transit provider.\n\nMost recently, Walder was the CEO of Motivate, which is now owned by Lyft.

It was founded in 2012, two years after Williams stepped down as Twitter CEO.\n\nThe site currently has 90 million unique users each month, and publishes 20,000 articles per day, mostly from writers creating one-off articles. It recently moved away from selling advertising as a revenue model to a subscription paywall, in which readers are asked for money if they see more than three stories per month.\n\nWilliams said Medium's last investment round was in early 2016. \"We will be raising more money but there is nothing to disclose on that.\"\n\nThe investment will go into Williams' effort to make Medium a bit more like a vast, thoughtful magazine. What started as a longform blogging platform is looking more and more like The Atlantic crossed with Wikipedia. Williams has a corp of editors who are paying fees or commissions to writers for high-quality material, and then keeping that high-quality content behind the paywall. While the majority of Medium's writers are amateurs writing for coffee money, the professional work \u2014 which feels a lot like the journalism you'd see in a monthly magazine \u2014 will get much of the investment, he said.\n\n\"We pay thousands of writers on a monthly basis,\" he said. \"Whether they participate in our partners program indirectly, and we pay them directly through our editorial team. And we license content from major publishers ... we are ramping the budgets for all those avenues every month.\"\n\nWilliams said he is doubling down on the subscription business \u2014 dubbed \"Medium Membership \u2014 because the future of journalism depends on not giving it away for free. \"We are coming out of this phase where it was assumed that the best quality journalism is free in unlimited quantities,\" he said. \"No other business is like that.\"\n\nThe company was valued last year at $600 million.", "Satanists are suing Netflix and Warner Bros. over the new Netflix series \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,\" accusing the companies of ripping off its statue of Baphomet, a goat-headed deity.\n\nIn a complaint filed Thursday in New York, The Satanic Temple accuses the companies of \"copyright infringement, false designation of original, false description; and forbidden dilution under trademark dilution, and Injury to Business reputation under New York General Business Law.\"\n\nThe Temple seeks no less than $50 million in damages.\n\nNetflix referred inquiries to Warner Bros., which declined to comment.\n\nThe Satanic Temple threatened legal action last month over the statue, which appears regularly in the new series that follows Sabrina and other young witches who get their powers from Satan. The suit accuses Netflix and Warner Bros. of copying one particular statue of Baphomet, made by the Temple, and then implying it stood for evil in the series.\n\nThe Temple states that its mission is to \"encourage benevolence and empathy among all people, reject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense and justice, and be directed by the human conscience to undertake noble pursuits guided by the individual will.\"\n\nThe Temple says in the lawsuit that it views Satan as a \"literary Satan,\" \"meant to be a rebel against God's authority, rather than an evil being.\" It also claims to advocate \"equal representation where religious monuments are placed on public property\" and \"legal protection against laws that unscientifically restrict women's reproductive autonomy,\" according to its website.\n\nThe Temple argues in its lawsuit that \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\" depicts its antagonists in \"stark contrast\" to the Temple's beliefs and that the show implies the Baphomet statue \"stands for evil.\"\n\n\"Among other morally repugnant actions, the Sabrina Series' evil antagonists engage in cannibalism and forced-worship of a patriarchal deity,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nThe Temple says it created the statue Baphomet with Children from 2013 to 2014 in response to a statue of the Ten Commandments being donated to Oklahoma City. The Temple says in the lawsuit that the statue cost approximately $100,000 to develop. It temporarily placed the statue near the Arkansas Capitol in August to protest another monument of the Ten Commandments, arguing for religious equality.\n\nWhile Baphomet is a figure that has been used in various ways throughout history, the Temple alleges that Netflix copied its specific iteration.\n\nThe \"Sabrina\" production designer, Lisa Soper, seems to disagree.\n\nThe lawsuit cites an interview with Vice in which Soper said: \"I think that's kind of a coincidence. When you look at Baphomet, there's really only a couple of statues of him \u2014 which, they have their statue, and we've got our statue in the show. If you look at Goya paintings, if you look at a lot of the tarot cards, or the Aleister Crowley iterations of him \u2014 because there's hundreds and hundreds of iterations of him, he's always seen with his people around him and it's more of like a father figure kind of thing.\"\n\nShe added: \"But it's no different from, in my opinion anyhow ... from any other of the mass amounts of iterations of him that have been around.\"\n\nThe lawsuit argues that this is false, saying, \"Baphomet has never been depicted with two children gazing reverentially at the Sabbatic Goat head.\"\n\nBaphomet has also generally been depicted with \"exposed large voluptuous female breasts, not a male chest,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nBelow is a comparison, included in the lawsuit, of the Temple's Baphomet with Children statue and the \"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\" statue:\n\nSatanic Temple's Baphomet with Children:\n\nSatanic Temple\n\n\"Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\" statue:", "The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged as expected at a two-day meeting that concluded Thursday, signaling that it would continue to raise rates gradually amid stable economic growth.\n\nIn its policy statement, the Fed acknowledged the strength of consumer spending, which in the second and third quarters propelled the economy to its strongest back-to-back quarters of growth in four years. The Fed added, however, that business investment recently slowed from the brisk pace it recorded earlier this year.\n\nTraders are certain that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will next raise interest rates in December \u2014 a decision that would almost immediately lift borrowing costs for Americans with credit cards and other short-term loans. The market has priced in a 78% probability that the committee will raise the benchmark fed funds rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% at its meeting in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"Heightened financial market volatility has not altered the Fed's resolve to hike in December,\" said Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley's chief US economist.\n\nThe Fed also appears to be unwavering in the face of criticism from President Donald Trump, who has called the central bank \"crazy\" for tightening financial conditions.\n\nThursday's statement marked the Fed's final policy announcement, at least for the foreseeable future, that was not followed by a press conference.

In just his third game in the NBA, Young scored 35 points on 13-of-23 shooting to put up the biggest numbers by a rookie since Stephen Curry's 42-point performance for the Golden State Warriors in 2010.\n\nBut he's just getting started. In this season of Young Hollywood original docu-series \"Rookie On The Rise,\" which will follow Young through his rookie campaign after chronicling Utah Jazz sensation Donovan Mitchell's rise to stardom last year, Young lays out his ambitions to continue achieving unprecedented feats at the next level.\n\n\"People are watching me even closer than anybody because I've done something that no one has ever done before,\" Young said. \"I'm just different.\"\n\nYoung proved his shooting from distance was pro-ready even before the NBA season began. He drained a deep last-second three-pointer for the win against the San Antonio Spurs October 10:\n\nNow that the regular season is well underway, the Lubbock, Texas native has his sights set on the NBA single-game three-point record. Earlier this season, Warriors sharpshooter Klay Thompson shrugged off a shooting slump in epic fashion, breaking teammate Stephen Curry's previous record of 13 three-pointers in a single game in a 52-point comeback performance for the ages. Young believes he can hit enough shots from beyond the arc to take over the record. After all, he hit 10 three-pointers against TCU during his only season playing college basketball.\n\n\"I would like to break it,\" Young told The Undefeated's Aaron Dodson back when Curry still held the record. \"I definitely feel like I'm capable of breaking it. But that's a lot of threes in a game. I ain't gonna lie.\"\n\nFor their part, Young Hollywood had plenty of reason to choose Young as the focus of the second season of \"Rookie On The Rise.\" In addition to becoming the first-ever Division I player to lead the NCAA in points and assists, Young tied the NCAA record for most assists in a single contest, dropping 22 dimes against Northwestern State last December. He broke a slew of freshman and Oklahoma program records while setting the Big 12 record for most 40-point games in a single season and most points in the regular season.\n\n\"We're excited to put our bets on Atlanta Hawks star rookie Trae Young for Season two,\" Young Hollywood CEO and founder R.J. Williams told Business Insider. \"We started shooting content with Trae during the [NBA] Draft process in New York, then at the Summer League in Las Vegas, and right from the start, we believed he would have massive potential to make an impressive impact in his career. His skills on the court thus far this season \u2014 like scoring a 30-foot game winner \u2014 have obviously proven that he could be a true contender for Rookie of the Year.

Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images\n\nYou don't have to own a small island or a luxury jet to take a (legal) hint from how millionaires and billionaires protect their money from taxes. Here are three ways you can navigate your own taxes like the wealthy do:\n\nAssess your taxable income\n\nYour first step is to know how you are being taxed, especially because the new tax laws are in effect for 2018. Taxable income is whatever money you made during the year, minus deductions or exemptions. It includes your salary, wages, bonuses, tips, and investment and unearned income.\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nClose to dropping a bracket? The big breaks in the new tax bill for married taxpayers filing jointly is below $77,400 (12% vs. 22%) and below $315,000 (24% vs. 32%).\n\nBusiness Insider\n\nIf you do find yourself on the edge of a bracket (or not), look for opportunities to reduce your taxable income this year. Here are some ways to leverage different accounts you may have available to you.\n\nMichael Solari\n\nCharitable donations\n\nNow that the standard deduction has increased from $12,700 for people married filing jointly to $24,000, you may want to double up on your giving every other year.\n\nWhy double up instead of giving the same amount every year? The new tax plan has a deduction limit of $10,000 for anyone who chooses to itemize income, sales (income), and property taxes. If you live in a state with high income taxes and property taxes, you are likely to hit that cap.\n\nFor example, let's say you file your taxes jointly with a spouse, max out your property tax at $10,000, and you have a mortgage interest of $10,000. If you usually make $4,000 in charitable contributions every year, you can hold off and make an $8,000 donation every other year so you can itemize. Depending on your tax bracket, this could save you quite a bit on your taxes.\n\nRoth conversions\n\nIf you have a traditional IRA, it's worth thinking about making a conversion for the tax-free benefits later. Plus, anyone who inherits your Roth will not have to pay any federal income on their withdrawals, as long as the account has been open more than five years.\n\nTraditional IRAs require that you take a minimum distribution (RMD) starting at age 70 \u00bd. This could bump you into another tax bracket in retirement, so you may want to consider reducing your balance. Using Roth conversions when you're older reduces your RMD and can significantly reduce your tax liability when you have to start taking distributions at 70 1/2. So if you're able to reduce your RMDs now, it has the potential to cost you less in taxes down the road.\n\nTax brackets have shifted, which means you may get more back on your tax return for 2018. Put that money to good use and convert some of it to a Roth IRA.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThere is a new tax law in town, and not brushing up on these changes could cost you. Take a hint from the wealthy and take full advantage of the tax benefits and deductions you are entitled to. It pays to be thorough and understand where you can gain some tax breaks.

We will, however, never tolerate a reporter placing his hands on a young woman just trying to do her job as a White House intern,\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.\n\nSanders stood by the statement on Thursday.\n\n\"The question is: did the reporter make contact or not? The video is clear, he did. We stand by our statement,\" Sanders told reporters.\n\n'I never thought I'd see this crap happen in the US'\n\nThe White House's decision to revoke Acosta's credentials has been decried by the White House press corps and journalist-advocacy groups.\n\nOlivier Knox, the president of the White House Correspondents' Association, said it was a \"weak and misguided action\" that should be immediately reversed.\n\n\"Journalists may use a range of approaches to carry out their jobs and the WHCA does not police the tone or frequency of the questions its members ask of powerful senior government officials, including the President,\" Knox said in a statement. \"Such interactions, however uncomfortable they may appear to be, help define the strength of our national institutions.\"\n\nTrump went on the offensive in a post-midterms press conference on Wednesday. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nThe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press described the move as \"clearly inappropriate\" and an \"unprecedented\" form of punishment, urging the White House to reinstate Acosta's credential immediately.\n\nIt further accused Sanders of falsely describing the exchange, characterizing her approach to the incident as \"insulting not only to the nation's journalists, but to its people.\"\n\n\"The founders of our country knew there would be tension between our leaders and our journalists. In fact, they designed our system that way, knowing that a free and assertive press is the best defense against tyranny,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nSome reporters and national security experts accused the White House of behavior akin to autocratic regimes.\n\n\"Fake videos are things we used to ascribe to Russia and other autocracies, not the American White House,\" Steven L. Hall, the former CIA chief of Russia operations, tweeted on Thursday.\n\nSimilarly, New York Times reporter Melissa Chan tweeted: \"As someone who has had my press credentials denied by authoritarian China, I never thought I'd see this crap happen in the US. And this 'most reporters are okay but @Acosta is aggressive' thing is the EXACT line Chinese propaganda printed about me. It's a tactic, people.\"\n\nThe White House shared a video from a conspiracy theorist to defend its false claims\n\nTo bolster the Trump administration's case, Sanders tweeted a suspicious video of the incident that appeared to show Acosta forcefully pushing the aide's arm away as she attempted to grab the mic.\n\nThe video was originally shared by Paul Joseph Watson, an editor-at-large for Infowars.com, a far-right conspiracy outlet. Content from Infowars has been banned from almost every major tech content distributor, including Apple, Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube, for violating their policies on hate speech.\n\nThe video Watson shared has become a subject of great debate on social media, and many have accused him of deliberately doctoring it.\n\nWatson told BuzzFeed the video was \"not edited \u2014 it's just zoomed in,\" and claimed the video he posted was derived from a gif shared by The Daily Wire, a right-leaning website.\n\n\"Digitally it's gonna look a tiny bit different after processing and zooming in, but I did not in any way deliberately 'speed up' or 'distort' the video. That's just horse s---,\" he said.\n\nAcosta does not appear to intentionally push the White House aide in the original news footage, and video shows him stating \"pardon me, ma'am\" as she attempted to grab the mic.\n\nThe video Watson and Sanders shared, however, was distorted in a way that seemingly speeds up the clip to make it look as though Acosta forcefully pushed the aide's arm.\n\nAcosta told CNN's Anderson Cooper he did not touch the White House aide in any way.", "In the midst of running Harry's, a razor company, cofounder and co-CEO Jeff Raider schedules personal time in his calendar.\n\nHarry's was founded in 2013 by Raider and co-CEO Andy Katz-Mayfield.

AT&T launched its digital TV package, DirecTV Now, in late 2016, and has tolerated bad margins in favor of growth. The service now has almost 2 million subscribers.\n\nBut AT&T's sentiment has changed recently, and its goal is now to \"stabilize EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] trends in the Entertainment Group,\" according to UBS.\n\n\"AT&T's Entertainment Group is struggling,\" the analysts explained. They noted that AT&T Entertainment Group includes all the company's residential business \u2014 including DirecTV and local telephone companies that provide voice, video, and data services \u2014 and that EBITDA in the segment is down 17% year to date.\n\nAT&T needs to cut costs, and a good place to do it is with DirecTV Now.\n\nUBS expects AT&T to launch a new DirecTV digital-TV service that will be delivered through a branded streaming device and will be positioned as its \"premium\" offering and keep a large channel lineup similar to a traditional cable or satellite package.\n\n\"This service is expected to more closely mirror the satellite product and enable the company to take better advantage of addressable advertising while avoiding the cost of a satellite installation,\" analysts wrote.\n\nIn this process, UBS expects DirecTV Now to be repositioned as a \"skinny bundle\" of channels, allowing DirecTV to keep the price point the same but cut channels out of the package and get to profitability that way.\n\nThat means some channels, which get paid carriage fees by AT&T for every package they are included in, will feel the pain as they get dropped from some of its offerings. One \"prime target\" UBS sees for this is Viacom, which owns channels like MTV, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon.\n\nHere is how UBS analysts estimate AT&T will price its offerings:\n\nUBS\n\nAT&T's change in focus toward profitability is not unique in the young industry of digital TV, often referred to as vMVPD, or virtual multichannel video programming distributor.\n\nOn Thursday, BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield wrote on Twitter that all the vMVPDs were slowing to \"focus on profits or lack thereof,\" except for YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and FuboTV. He described the latter three as \"playing the long game.\"\n\nBut whether these providers focus on short-term margins or subscriber growth, eventually their cost structures will have to come under control.\n\nEven Hulu, which Greenfield said is focused on growth, has talked recently about creating packages that have a \"positive margin.\" Morgan Stanley estimated last month that Hulu with Live TV did not break even on a gross-profit basis.\n\nAny talk of margin improvement is bad news for networks. For some, they will have to make the choice of bringing their carriage fees down or getting cut out of the bundle. Others with \"must-have\" content will have a better position at the table. But one thing is certain: Tough negotiations are coming for everyone.\n\nAT&T declined to comment.\n\nIf you have any thoughts or information on DirecTV, AT&T, or the future of digital television, contact the author at nmcalone@businessinsider.com.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Amedisys has a front-row seat to the challenges of an aging population in the US.\n\nElsewhere in the world \u2014 particularly in Scandinavia and Japan\u2014 countries have already started to experience a big shift into an aging population. In Japan, more than a quarter of the country's population is over 65, making it the world's oldest country. Some economists refer to the situation Japan is facing as a \"demographic time bomb.\"\n\nFor comparison, 20% of Sweden's population is over 65, and, as of 2015, about 15% of the US population was over 65.\n\n\"They're living with what we're going to hit in 10, 20 years,\" Kusserow said. So, to figure out what the US could do to keep itself from becoming overextended, Kusserow headed to those countries and took a look at how they are managing to take care of the elderly.\n\nAs a whole, the elder-care market is worth an estimated $350 billion, and home health, hospice and personal care are all in their own right multibillion-dollar businesses. The field is pretty fragmented: There are an estimated 2.5 million home-care workers out there, and about 12,400 home-health agencies managing them all.\n\nAmedisys is a relative giant in a field made up of lots of tiny companies. Amedisys' stock is up 117% from the beginning of the year, giving the company a market value of $3.7 billion. The company has 18,400 workers and cares for 369,000 people.\n\nRead more: A VC spoke to 30 founders and investors about the $350 billion elder-care market and found 3 reasons why starting a company in the market is a challenge\n\nHome care is growing as the US gets older. The idea is that having help at home, which can range from cooking and cleaning to bathing and medical care, can let elderly people stay independent for longer, and hopefully out of the hospital or nursing homes.\n\nThe problem is that as the number of elderly people increases, there's a risk of a shortage of home-care workers. The work itself tends to be difficult and poorly paid, too.\n\nOne solution is a change in the way at-home care is delivered. That's something countries like Japan and those in Scandinavia are figuring out through the help of technology, Kusserow said.\n\n\"What they're utilizing is really good technology,\" he said.\n\nHere's how that works: Say there's a relatively healthy 80-year-old living in Sweden who can still get around on her own. Using sensors \u2014 such as a watch with an accelerometer, a smart bathroom mat, or sensors around the kitchen \u2014 caregivers can remotely monitor her activity. Should she fall or stop going about her daily routine, those caregivers would be alerted and could intervene to help her out.\n\n\"They build that pattern analysis. When that's disrupted, caregivers go in,\" Kusserow said.\n\nThat way, the 80-year-old can keep living in her home instead of a nursing home or other kind of facility, making care much less expensive.\n\nWhile the US is using sensor technology for seniors, Kusserow said he hasn't seen it used effectively yet. That might start to change in the coming years, as the US starts to experience what countries like Japan have seen.\n\nOther big players in retail and technology have had their eyes on the aging population as well. In August, Best Buy bought health-services company GreatCall for $800 million. The company makes cell phones and connected devices that can alert emergency services for seniors.\n\nAmazon and Walmart both seem to have an interest in the space, with Amazon's move into the pharmacy business with its acquisition of PillPack and Walmart's partnerships with a health insurer focused on Medicare health insurance plans for the elderly.\n\nAmazon hasn't said much about its healthcare ambitions, but what it has talked about publicly has to do with the aging population.

This season, the Celtics welcomed back Irving and Gordon Hayward, the All-Star forward who missed all but five minutes of last season with an ankle injury. With a fully healthy team, Rozier was relegated to the bench, helping the Celtics become one of the deepest teams in the league, but leaving him with a more limited role behind Irving.\n\nRead more: How the Celtics pulled off one of the greatest rebuilds ever to become the team that should terrify the NBA\n\nThrough 10 games, the Celtics are 6-4 and have had some mild struggles incorporating all of the new pieces. This is to be expected \u2014 the Celtics got red-hot in the postseason last year with players like Rozier, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Al Horford shouldering more of a load. Now they all have to re-acclimate to having two All-Star players back on the court who soak up a good chunk of the offense.\n\nIt will take time.\n\nBut Rozier is one of the players whose playing time and usage has taken the biggest hit. He's averaging 22 minutes per game, scoring 7 points, 4 rebounds, and 2 assists per game while shooting just 35% from the field and 39% from three. The Celtics have played him and Irving together at times to get both players on the floor, but the pairing hasn't been their most effective, getting outscored by 8 points in 69 minutes and 4.8 points per 100 possessions.\n\nNow, according to multiple reports, it appears the situation is coming to a head. Publicly, Rozier has been accepting of his role, but according to Bill Simmons of The Ringer, Rozier is unhappy with his playing time. The Celtics may have to trade Rozier, according to Simmons, but the entire league is waiting on a trade, making a move all the more difficult.\n\nLikewise, The Athletic's Shams Charania reported that at least seven teams are monitoring the situation and interested in trading for Rozier.\n\nCharania reported that Celtics GM Danny Ainge is content with the team and not eager to move Rozier.\n\nAinge was on the \"Toucher and Rich\" show on Thursday and said Rozier hasn't expressed disappointment with his playing time and that other teams have not called and offered trades for Rozier.\n\nThe problem for the Celtics, even if Rozier is content to stay in his role, is that the clock is ticking. Rozier is a restricted free agent at the end of the season. Sports Illustrated's Chris Mannix and The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor separately reported that Rozier would be seeking a deal in free agency that pays him $16-$20 million per year.\n\nRozier is a valuable member of the Celtics; it's difficult to find a better backup point guard around the league. But it's unclear if the Celtics would be willing to pay starter's money for their backup guard, a player whose natural role will be playing spot minutes behind Irving.\n\nOf course, that in itself is not a guarantee. Irving can become a free agent at the end of the season and plans to re-sign with the Celtics. Irving said at a public Celtics event that he would be with the Celtics, and Charania reported that Irving told the Celtics front office that he plans to re-sign.\n\nBut anything can happen in the NBA. What if the Celtics take an unexpected downturn and come up well short of their Finals aspirations? What if Irving gets hurt again? Would re-signing a 28-year-old point guard with an extensive injury history to a max contract give the Celtics pause?\n\nThese are all hypotheticals, of course, but they show that just moving a (reportedly) unhappy Rozier is not such a simple decision.\n\nThe Celtics will likely only get better as the season goes on. They're currently the top defense in the NBA, and their top offensive weapons will get a better sense of how to play together. But even as on-court chemistry improves, every player will have to sacrifice playing time, shots, and overall role. The Irving-Rozier balance will be a delicate one that won't go away. How the Celtics decide to resolve it may be an ongoing plot point throughout the season.", "A Los Angeles mansion is on the market for $245 million, making it the most expensive house for sale in the US \u2014 and about 960 times more expensive than the typical American home.\n\nThe median US home price was $255,000 as of the second quarter of 2018, according to data compiled by ATTOM Data Solutions.\n\nSitting on nearly 11 acres, the main home of the Chartwell Estate was designed by Sumner Spaulding in 1930, according to the listing. In the 1980s, the mansion's interiors were renovated by designer Henri Samuel \u2014 but no recent photos have been released, keeping the inside of the home a mystery.\n\nThe expansive grounds of Chartwell include manicured gardens, a 75-foot pool, and views that span from downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Ocean. There's also a car gallery that fits 40 vehicles, a five-bedroom guest house, a tennis court, and a 12,00-bottle wine cellar. Last year, the property was l isted for $350 million.\n\nChartwell is listed with several agents: Jeff Hyland, Drew Fenton, and Gary Gold of Hilton & Hyland (a Christie's International Real Estate affiliate), along with Jade Mills, Joyce Rey, and Alexandra Allen of Coldwell Banker Global Luxury, and Drew Gitlin and Susan Gitlin of Berkshire Hathaway Home Services.\n\nHere's a look at the sprawling estate's grounds.", "There have been 307 mass shootings in the US so far in 2018.\n\nOn Wednesday, a 28-year-old Marine veteran opened fire inside the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, a Los Angeles-area suburb. Thirteen people are dead, including a police officer, Sgt. Ron Helus, and the shooter, Ian David Long, who killed himself. Up to 15 other people were injured and taken to hospitals.\n\nBecause these deadly events have become so common in the US, a team of researchers from the University of Toledo in Ohio set out to look for patterns or similarities among communities that have dealt with a mass shooting.\n\nRead more: At least 13 dead, including gunman, at college-bar mass shooting in Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks\n\nThey looked at 155 mass shootings in the US (defined as an event with four or more fatalities, excluding the shooter). Their research, which was presented at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress last month, found several factors that are clearly associated with a higher risk of a mass shooting.\n\nThese include a shortage of mental-health professionals, a lack of opportunities for social interaction, greater income inequality, and relatively high housing costs.\n\nTwo common gun restriction laws were also found to be correlated with a lower incidence of mass shootings: a requirement that mental-health records get reported in criminal background checks, and restrictions on open carry firearms.\n\nMental-health care as prevention\n\nDr. Stephen Markowiak, a general surgery research fellow at the University of Toledo, led the study.\n\n\"From the clinician side of things, when somebody gets shot, we're on the receiving end of that,\" Markowiak told Business Insider. \"We have entire chapters in our textbooks dedicated to how to fix the problem once it happens, but there's relatively little available to us on how to keep it from happening in the first place. That's such a shame in a world where people know prevention is more powerful than cure.\"\n\nScott Olson/Getty Images\n\nFrom their research, Markowiak's team concluded that access to mental-health resources is an extremely important factor when it comes to the risk of a mass shooting. Communities with more mental-health providers per capita saw lower rates of mass shootings in their analysis.\n\nThat finding is similar to that of a 2016 study, which suggested that states that spend more money on mental-health care and K-12 education have fewer school shootings.\n\nSuch evidence highlights healthcare providers' role in improving and protecting communities, Markowiak said.\n\nAnother important risk factor was a lack of socialization.\n\n\"If you look at communities where these events occurred, the average individual had 10.5 to 11 people that they commonly associate with compared with an average of 13 or so close associations in communities where they didn't occur,\" Markowiak noted in a release about the study.\n\nFor their study, Markowiak's team used data from the FBI, US Census, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Their analysis controlled for variables like population density, urbanicity, and the proportion of males ages 20-44 in the community.\n\nDoes gun control work?\n\nThe study's results suggest that not all gun laws are equal when it comes to lowering the risk of a mass shooting.\n\nStates with strict regulations, like New York and California, had high rates of mass shootings. But stricter gun laws were associated with less violent crime overall.\n\nPlus, the results showed that fewer mass shootings occur in places where criminal background checks require reports on an individual's mental health. The same correlation held true for areas in which the open carry of firearms is restricted.\n\nThis study is the latest in a growing body of evidence that certain gun-control policies can reduce rates of gun violence.\n\nThis week, research presented at a conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics showed that in states with the most lenient gun regulations, twice as many kids die because of firearms compared with states where gun laws are strictest.\n\nAnd last month, a first-of-its-kind analysis found that gun injuries sent 75,000 US children and teens to emergency rooms over nine years. The total cost: almost $3 billion.\n\n'We could solve this problem if we wanted to'\n\nMarkowiak stressed that his team's conclusions were apolitical and only based on correlation, not causation. So he doesn't have recommendations about specific gun-control policies. But he said he hopes the results lead political and community leaders to prioritize community health across the nation and take a holistic approach to combatting mass shootings.\n\nMarkowiak noted, though, that he fears the sharp divisions within the American political landscape are stalling potential improvements.\n\n\"If we could be more honest with ourselves, and talk about things with less of a heated political sense, we might move past some of these issues,\" Markowiak said. \"We have to be able to agree on the facts. That's what our project is \u2014 trying to kick-start a discussion and provide some evidence.\"\n\nAnother barrier to progress in reversing the mass-shooting trend, Markowiak added, is that organizations like the NIH, CDC, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u2014 which are known for gathering data that informs policy making \u2014 have seen their ability to research gun violence restricted.\n\nIndeed, the US spends less money researching gun violence than it does on almost any other leading cause of death. That's because of \"incredibly poor leadership decisions\" from lawmakers, Markowiak said.\n\n\"The reality is, we could solve this problem if we wanted to,\" he said. \"We have these excellent resources available to our country that have a decades-old history of solving public-health crises.\"", "California Sen. Dianne Feinstein called for votes on a number of gun control bills following the Thousand Oaks shooting that left 12 people and the gunman dead on Wednesday night.\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, the Democratic senator said that if gun laws don't change, the country will see \"more bodies lying at the foot of failed Republican leadership.\"\n\nHer statement came after a gunman identified as 28-year-old Ian David Long opened fire at the Borderline Bar & Grill in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks, California.\n\n\"These mass murders are depressingly pervasive. Schools. Theaters. Malls. Offices. Synagogues. Grocery stores. Bars. Concerts. Churches. They're inspired by racism, revenge, terrorism, or just pure hatred. The one common attribute: easy access to guns,\" Feinstein said.\n\nShe said that stronger laws are needed to prevent further shootings, and a number of bills, including one on a renewed ban on military style assault weapons and one on a ban on bump stocks, are ready for votes.\n\n\"We could hold these votes next week and have bills on the president's desk by Thanksgiving. Instead, Republicans refuse to take any action at all,\" Feinstein said.\n\nRead more: At least 13 dead, including gunman, at college-bar mass shooting in Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks\n\nPresident Donald Trump made a statement about the shooting on Twitter saying he had been briefed on the incident.\n\nHe thanked law enforcement and said \"god bless\" to the victims, but made no mention of gun control laws.\n\nFeinstein said the Republican Party's failure to act on the mass shootings across the country is \"cowardice of epic proportions.\"\n\n\"We may not be able to stop all gun violence, but that doesn't mean Republicans should be allowed to bury their heads in the sand and not try to stop any of it,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"As long as they stand in fear of the NRA and worry more about the power of the gun lobby than the lives of their fellow citizens, we'll see more Thousand Oaks, more bodies lying at the foot of failed Republican leadership.\"\n\nThe NRA has yet to respond to the shooting, but posted a tweet yesterday critical of the medical community's response to guns.\n\nFor more, head to INSIDER's homepage.", "Cisco and Amazon Web Services have announced a new cloud product that enterprises will likely love but should cause some heartburn for AWS' competitor Google Cloud and Cisco's competitor VMware.\n\nCisco's product, known by the tongue-twister name of \"Cisco Hybrid Solution for Kubernetes on AWS,\" will allow companies to easily move their cloud apps between their own data centers and AWS. Using both a private data center and a cloud is known as \"hybrid computing.\"\n\nThe service focuses on a particularly hot area of cloud computing known as Kubernetes, a technology created by Google.\n\nCloud apps typically use a technology called \"containers,\" which make sure the app doesn't break if something changes with the cloud setup or as the app is moved from one area of a cloud to another. Kubernetes helps companies manage thousands of containers as those companies put more of their apps onto the cloud.\n\nRead more: Two software companies fed up with Amazon, Alibaba, and other big cloud players have a controversial new plan to fight back\n\nBut the truly interesting part of this announcement isn't so much the technology; it's the stake in the ground that Cisco and AWS have planted with it.\n\nCisco is one of those companies that could have been another IBM \u2014 a victim of the rise of cloud computing, in which companies don't need to buy servers, storage, and networks to run their apps and instead rent it all from the cloud provider. But under CEO Chuck Robbins, Cisco is offering more and more cloud products, getting in on the recurring software revenues that cloud services provide.\n\nAmazon Wev Services scores big\n\nThis isn't the first partnership between Cisco and AWS. Cisco has been selling networking software that has many of the functions of a hardware router on AWS for a few years now.\n\nBut a year ago, Cisco partnered with Google to create network software for Google Cloud. Google created Kubernetes and then gave it away as a free and open-source software project. Google uses its expertise with Kubernetes as one of its selling points to get customers to use its cloud.\n\nThat joint product with Cisco became available for Google's customers to use about a month ago. What does it do? Among other things, it lets companies do hybrid computing for apps using Kubernetes.\n\nCisco CEO Chuck Robbins. Cisco Live/Business Insider So by offering a similar service on AWS, score one for AWS.\n\n\"This is a win for AWS, as many of the Cisco management tools are involved in this partnership; notably, Cisco Appdynamics is a leading tool in the market,\" Stephen Elliot, a vice president for market researcher IDC, said.\n\nCisco's AWS product also gives Cisco game with the biggest cloud provider, the one that many of Cisco's customers would no doubt be asking it to work with. Cisco will not only offer subscription software on AWS, but has developed some hardware those companies can buy, helping it sell more of its traditional gear as well.\n\nAnd the AWS Kubernetes services will be promoted by Cisco's enormous and powerful salesforce and its giant network of sales partners. Another score for Amazon.\n\n\"Keep in mind Cisco's massive sales channel. AWS can get some access to it via this partnership. It's a win-win for both firms,\" Elliot said.\n\nBut there's a bonus in there for Cisco, as well. In a big, splashy announcement a couple of years ago, Amazon had previously partnered with one of Cisco's biggest rivals, VMware, to offer hybrid-cloud-computing services. Kubernetes is widely considered to be a technology that makes VMware's flagship technology obsolete.\n\nSo, by offering a Kubernetes product on AWS, Cisco has elbowed into VMware's partnership with the cloud-computing giant.\n\nOne more burn for Google\n\nAnd there's one more burn for Google in there. Amazon has recently been criticized by companies that make open-source software for being a taker and not giving back.\n\nAmazon has every legal right to Kubernetes as a service. Google has given it away as an open-source project managed by an independent organization.\n\nGoogle Cloud CEO Diane Greene. Greg Sandoval/Business Insider But there's a social contract involved when companies open source their software. Anyone can use it, or change it, but they are supposed to share their changes with the whole group. In this way, the creator gets help with building and growing the project, and everyone benefits.\n\nBut Amazon has come under fire for \"strip mining\" \u2014 taking open-source projects and commercializing them (as it is legally allowed to do), but not contributing to them. One open-source company recently grew so fed up with Amazon and other cloud providers over this practice that it's now trying to get a new license passed that would force strip miners to either contribute or pay.\n\nAmazon charges its customers for Kubernetes. But for a company with such a large amount of engineering resources, it contributes only a tiny bit back, according to the organization that manages the project.\n\nThe project's biggest contributor, by a mile, is Google.", "While some progressive insurgents in blue districts made gains in this year's midterms, a slew of leftist firebrands running in red and purple districts fared poorly on Tuesday, losing races that Democrats knew would be tough but were nevertheless optimistic about winning.\n\nCandidates from Virginia to California threw out the conventional playbook for red district Democrats, testing the theory that unabashed leftists can energize new voters while spurning conservatives \u2014 and it didn't pan out quite as they'd hoped. Meanwhile, the path to Democratic control of the House was paved by more moderate candidates who ran on fixing Obamacare and being a check on President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The candidates who excited the progressive base got cooked,\" said Sean McElwee, a progressive activist and pollster who helped push Democratic incumbents and candidates to join his call to abolish ICE. \"It really does seem that the sort of big winner over the night were 'normie' Democrats.\"\n\nKara Eastman, a social worker who defeated the Democratic establishment's pick in her Nebraska primary and ran on bold progressive policy goals \u2014 including Medicare for All and abortion rights \u2014 lost her competitive swing district by three points.

Others say progressive groups like Our Revolution and Justice Democrats didn't do enough to direct resources their way.\n\n\"I think it says more about the fact that some progressive groups talked a big game but when it came down to financial support, they didn't spend the money to help their candidates,\" Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist and former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton's campaign, told INSIDER.\n\nDespite Tuesday's losses, McElwee argued that the broader arc of the party is bending leftwards.\n\nIn virtually every district where a Democrat was successfully primaried, the replacement was to the left of their predecessor. Insurgents made some key gains in blue districts where Democratic voters embraced younger, more progressive, and more racially diverse candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York City and Ayanna Pressley in Boston.\n\n\"In blue districts the Democrats are getting bluer and in purple districts they're also getting bluer,\" McElwee said.\n\nBut many on the left have pointed out that solid Democratic centrists also didn't do particularly well on Tuesday. Former Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen, who ran to the center as a fiscal conservative, lost by 11 points to conservative hard-liner Rep. Marsha Blackburn.\n\nSens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 both of whom ran as moderates \u2014 lost by far larger margins than did Rep. Beto O'Rourke in Texas, who was defeated by Sen.

In Florida, Andrew Gillum came within a single point of becoming the purple state's first black governor.\n\nDemocrats point to the fact that unapologetic progressives like O'Rourke, Gillum, and Stacey Abrams in Georgia energized historic numbers of voters and came closer to winning than more moderate candidates have in those states in past years.\n\n\"I believed going into election night that Andrew Gillum, Beto O'Rourke, Stacey Abrams \u2014 that they represented the future of the Democratic party, and that is true win or lose,\" Jon Lovett, a former Obama speechwriter, said on Wednesday's \"Pod Save America\" podcast.", "Strelka/Flickr\n\nI've been freelancing for more than two decades.

I'm a college dropout who stumbled into a writing career. I didn't go to journalism school or have a mentor.

This strategy has paid dividends in my life, both personally and professionally.\n\nA balancing act\n\nAs soon as I learned how to balance being an empathetic human being with my own sense of agency, I became far more successful in life, in general.\n\nI'm a giver by nature (but most definitely not a people-pleaser). If I drop my walls and let you in, you're all in, and I'll go to the mat for you every time.

That kind of support is invaluable.\n\nThe not-so-great thing is I've learned is that people will take advantage of kindness. As a result, I've had to learn how to set hard and fast boundaries. I stopped saying \"yes\" to things I don't want to do, whether it's a work project or personal engagement. If something doesn't bring positivity into my life, I steer clear.\n\nThe benefits of boundaries\n\nSome people interpret my boundaries as a way of keeping people out, but they make my life easier and free up the space to give more of myself to things that actually matter to me. I choose to invest my time in creating a happy and prosperous life and don't make room for people or projects that drain my energy.\n\nYou're never going to please anyone 100% of the time, and you should never apologize for putting yourself first, especially if it puts you in a better position to help others.\n\nEstablishing boundaries allows you to prioritize your well-being while creating the space to be kind and take care of others.

Here's how it got there.\n\n\"We want our members and customers to know that we're open to serve them online and in stores, both at Kmart and at Sears,\" Peter Boutros, chief brand officer for Sears and Kmart, said in a press release on Thursday, which also announced the retailer's Black Friday store hours.\n\nThis year, Kmart stores will be open from 6 a.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving, before reopening at 6 a.m. on Black Friday \u2014 a slight extension on last year's opening hours.\n\nMost Sears stores will open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving and close at midnight, then reopen at 5 a.m. on Black Friday.\n\nShoppers should expect to see some big discounts, especially as the company looks to clear inventory from the 142 stores that it said it would be closing before year-end.\n\nIn Thursday's press release, it offered a teaser of those deals, which include a 55% discount on a Kenmore refrigerator.\n\nWhen it filed for bankruptcy, Sears announced that its somewhat controversial CEO, Eddie Lampert, would be stepping down from that role but staying on as chairman.\n\n\"Over the last several years, we have worked hard to transform our business and unlock the value of our assets,\" Lampert said in a statement to the press at the time. \"While we have made progress, the plan has yet to deliver the results we have desired, and addressing the Company's immediate liquidity needs has impacted our efforts to become a profitable and more competitive retailer.\"\n\nSome have blamed Lampert for the company's downfall. He has been accused of leaving its stores to rot by failing to invest in improvements or provide the necessary amount of staff.\n\nRead more about Black Friday 2018:", "A group of passengers on a Sriwijaya Air flight almost got in a fight with the crew over the foul and smelly presence of durian fruit, which temporarily grounded the plane, according to multiple reports.\n\nCNN reports that a Sriwijaya Air flight, headed from Bengkulu, a province in Southwest Sumatra, to Jakarta, Indonesia had to be grounded after passengers refused to board the plane that was carrying two tons of durian fruit.\n\nDurian fruit is a notoriously foul-smelling fruit that earlier this year forced an Australian University to evacuate because it smelled like gasoline.\n\nNot surprisingly, passengers about to take their seats on the Sriwijaya Air flight could not handle its presence in the cargo section of the plane and refused to board.\n\nRead More: Ryanair fires 6 crew members after a staged photo went viral of them sleeping on the airport floor\n\nCNN reports the airline tried to placate passengers by placing coffee powder and pandan leaves over the boxes containing the fruit to absorb the smell, and told passengers the smell would go away once the plane was airborne.\n\nBut passengers refused to board, chanting and yelling in unison, with the BBC.com reporting some \"almost came to blows with crew members.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, the airline eventually heeded the passengers' request and removed the fruit from the plane, which departed an hour later than scheduled.\n\nOne can only imagine how bad the smell of Durian fruit is to create this scene between an airline and its passengers.\n\nThe late Anthony Bourdain once said, \"Your breath will smell as if you'd been French-kissing your dead grandmother.\"\n\nAccording to Kristen Lee, a writer for Gawker Media, the fruit has a pungent odor: \"I honestly cannot remember the taste very much, because the smell stabbed into my nostrils like a rancid meat poker, blinding me against all my other senses. I also cannot describe that smell to you now because I have blocked it from my mind, but I can tell you that it was Bad.\"", "According to the American Academy of Dermatology, \"Acne appears when a pore in our skin clogs. This clog begins with dead skin cells. [Then] when the body starts to make lots of sebum, oil that keeps our skin from drying out, the dead skin cells can stick together inside the pore. Instead of rising to the surface, the cells become trapped inside the pore.\"\n\nThis is why you get acne in general, and that same perfect storm of oil, pores, and dead skin can occur on your chest as it does on your face.\n\n\"Just as we have oil glands on the face, we also have them on the chest. This explains why the chest is a common location to develop acne,\" Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research at Mount Sinai Hospital, explained to INSIDER.", "With Netflix's library of original content getting ever larger, it makes sense that people will tend to follow their favorite critics in deciding what to watch and what to avoid.\n\nHowever, critics don't always get it right. Though shows like \"The Crown\" and \"GLOW\" have hit the spot with critics and viewers alike, plenty of other titles have left the critics cold while winning over the public.\n\nHere are eight Netflix original shows that were dead on arrival according to their critic scores on Rotten Tomatoes, but that are actually worth your while. And it's not just me saying so, judging by their impressive audience scores.", "Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nNarrator: It's a song you've all heard at least once. And it was probably not like anything you've heard before. I'm of course talking about Queen's legendary single \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" a song that, even 40 years later, is one of the most influential and memorable songs of our generation. But have you ever wondered why this six-minute single that no one ever thought would be a hit became one of the most famous songs ever written?\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was a song long in the making, but it officially kicked into gear in the summer of 1975, when Freddie Mercury began writing it as an operatic piece titled, \"Real Life.\" After the success of their last album \"Sheer Heart Attack,\" Queen was given complete creative freedom and control over their next piece. And it's obvious that they took that creative freedom and ran with it.\n\nIrwin Fisch: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" had a very rare effect on people, which is that it was one of those songs where the first time you heard it, you hadn't heard anything like it. In my image is that it's the kind of song that makes you pull over to the side of the road, because you go, \"What the devil is this?\" Very few songs have done that, and that did.\n\nNarrator: And he's right. \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was different for its time and still is today. Unlike most pop hits that lasted around three minutes, it was a six-minute pop single that has an opera, an opera, right in the middle of the song.\n\nFisch: It actually in some ways hasn't been influential, because it was so fully realized that it was a little bit of, \"Where do we go from here?\" It managed to become a ubiquitous part of the culture and something that never gets off the radio and never stops in the karaoke bars and is used in movies, and it's all over the place because nobody has still done anything that sounds like that.\n\nNarrator: One of the reasons why \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" sounds so different is in its structure. The song is neither an a cappella, a ballad, an opera or rock. It's actually all of them in one song. Fisch: It advanced a tradition of suites in pop music, meaning not a continuous song, not a verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge structure, which was the norm. A put together group of different songs, in essence. So if people refer to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as a song, that's a bit of a misnomer. It's actually three or four songs.\n\nNarrator: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" can actually be divided into five different sections: an a cappella introduction. Ballad. Opera. Hard rock. And finally a reflective coda. It was also highly unusual for a popular single to not include a chorus, while combining different musical styles and lyrics. It is by definition a mind-blowing genre bender.\n\nFisch: This innovation started around the mid-'60s. It started basically with the Beach Boys and the Beatles. Beach Boys with \"Good Vibrations.\" The Beatles with \"A Day in the Life.\" Epic songs that pieced together different ideas into a cohesive whole. Queen, in \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" took that idea and pushed it way over the top.\n\nNarrator: And to see just how over the top they went, you need to look no farther than this operatic section of the song. The lyrics name characters from classical Italian theaters, quotes from the Quran, and the demon Beelzebub. And this section that sounds like it's been sung by a roomful of choir was actually just three people: Freddie Mercury, drummer Roger Taylor, and guitarist Brian May. It's not just the vocals; there's harmony everywhere, even in the instruments that almost sound like echoes. This technique was heavily inspired by a production method called the \"Wall of Sound,\" developed in 1960 by producer Phil Spector. He put masses of musicians in one room, three keyboard players playing the same part but in various similar instruments, like the harpsichord or an electric piano, and recording them together to create a sound the likes of which had never been heard before. That was exactly what Queen wanted to accomplish.\n\nFisch: When people talk about what a great song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is, they're talking equally, or even more, about the production.\n\nNarrator: To achieve the sound that they wanted, Queen used a technique known as reduction mixing, also called ping pong recording. Most of the pop songs you listen to today use a lot of audio tracks, each track reserved for different instruments and vocals, combining to make one song. But back then, technology limited the amount of audio tracks that could be used. For example, Beatles' legendary \"Sgt. Pepper's\" was recorded on an analog four-track record. And to fit more than four tracks in a four-track record, they would record all four tracks, then bounce all their tracks into one, record, bounce again, and repeat. The bounce tracks would combine all of the tracks into one, meaning if you raise the sound of that particular track, it would raise the volume of all the individual tracks within.\n\nFisch: Part of the great challenge of that process was that you had to make commitments to your mix, to the blending of everything as you went along, so you needed to have a lot of foresight and a great image of where you were going. By the time Queen made \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" we were up to 24-track tape. By today's standards, that's still not many tracks. They had so many vocals and they had so many layers of guitars. I've heard that they had about 180 individual tracks that got put onto a 24-track, two-inch tape.\n\nNarrator: But of course this method of bouncing tracks came with its own challenges. Once it's done, you can't go back to just fix it, like we can do now.\n\nFisch: Two-inch, 24-track tape that they were working on, it was a physical process. It was a razor blade. It was an edit block where the tape would sit there. You would slice through the two-inch tape. You would cut out what you wanted to cut out. And you would splice it together with a little piece of white tape. Now it's very easy digitally. You chop it on the screen. If you made a mistake, you can fix it. Everything now is non-destructive. Everything they did then was destructive, so it took a lot of commitment and a lot of knowledge and a very, very intense, deep skillset to be able to piece that stuff together and have it sound smooth.\n\nNarrator: Just how much tracking went into the song becomes more evident when you remove the instruments to just listen to the vocals.\n\nFisch: And before the Beatles and before the Beach Boys, a song was a song. It needed to be presentable on the piano. If you sat down and played \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" from start to finish on the piano, you probably would say, \"Wow, that's really wild and interesting.\" But you probably wouldn't say that's going to be a hit that's gonna endure for 40 years. What made it that had a lot to do with the sound they created.\n\nNarrator: And of course, it's hard to talk about \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" without talking about the man behind the song, Freddie Mercury, because this song was his baby, his brainchild. Unlike most of Queen's songs that were written collaboratively in the studio, this was a song that, according to the guitarist Brian May, was \"all in Freddie's head\" before it even began recording.\n\nFisch: Freddie Mercury talked about the song in an interview as \"experimentation in sound.\" I think that could be taken to mean that the experiment was to see if he could get what was in his head, his sonic preconceptions, out there. I don't think it was the kind of experimentation where they went into the studio to just see what would happen, because he was famously buttoned-up and had the production and the notes and the arrangements and sound of the thing in his head. I think the experiment was really about seeing if something unique could be realized in the studio. An important reason that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" resonates and has resonated for over 40 years is that it embodied something very intense, which is Freddie Mercury's personality and life. That record is an oral extension of Freddie Mercury's self-consciousness without shame. It's music in some ways the sensibilities are out of the closet. As a performer, there hadn't been a Freddie Mercury before Freddie Mercury.\n\nNarrator: And perhaps beyond all the notes, lyrics and performances, what truly makes \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" great is that it embodies what every musical piece should be: the talent and the drive to push boundaries and create something that brings us together, even 40 years later. In a time where pop songs just all generally sound the same, maybe that's why we still can't stop listening to \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" With just this one song, Freddie Mercury and Queen became something that very few artists managed to achieve: a legend.", "One of the major criticisms of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives over the last two years has been its apparent protection of President Donald Trump from scrutiny over his campaign's contacts with Russia-linked individuals during the 2016 election.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats flipped the House following the midterm elections and effectively cut off that buffer.\n\nMany Trump critics say the timing couldn't have been better, because the very next day, Trump ousted embattled Attorney General Jeff Sessions and replaced him with a hardline loyalist who has publicly railed against the special counsel Robert Mueller and speculated about how to gut the Russia investigation.\n\nIn the wake of Sessions' dismissal, perhaps the most crucial weapon at Democrats' disposal is the ability to subpoena documents and witnesses relevant to any pending or future investigations into the executive branch.\n\nSessions has long been one of the central figures in the congressional and FBI Russia probes. Legal experts told Insider that not only could Sessions become one of the witnesses Democrats call to testify, but his willingness to cooperate with investigators may have also increased following his removal.\n\nKurt Bardella, a former spokesperson for Republicans on the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, didn't mince words when discussing the importance of subpoena power.\n\n\"The Democrats gaining subpoena authority is the most consequential effect of the elections,\" Bardella told Insider. \"When Republicans started the inquiry into Benghazi, they had no idea it would lead to the discovery that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was using a private email server. Imagine how different the 2016 campaign would have been if 'Hillary's emails' had not been an issue.\"\n\nThe House Oversight Committee has already compiled a list of 64 subpoenas and inquiries looking into Trump administration activities that Democrats say Republicans didn't allow them to investigate before.\n\nAnd a Democratic source close to the House Intelligence Committee told Insider that issuing subpoenas to individuals and entities they were previously barred from contacting will be central to Democrats' game plan once they start reopening investigative threads in the panel's Russia probe that they say Republicans ignored.\n\n'We have to keep all these seats'\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, right, and ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff. Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has been the epicenter of partisan bickering over the Trump-Russia controversy for nearly two years. Though Chairman Devin Nunes and Ranking Member Adam Schiff first pledged to work together to investigate the Trump campaign's Russia contacts, the probe soon devolved into two separate investigations.\n\nWhile Democrats pushed to secure documents and question witnesses about Trump's links to Russia, Republicans launched a parallel investigation into purported surveillance abuses and misconduct at the Department of Justice and FBI. The Republican inquiry was largely led by Nunes \u2014 even though he recused himself from the investigation last year \u2014 and wielded significant influence through the use of subpoenas.\n\nIn particular, Republicans subpoenaed thousands of pages of classified Russia documents from the DOJ and later released many of them to the public with the White House's backing.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this year, Schiff laid out a detailed list of the individuals and entities he said Nunes refused to allow Democrats to question in the House Russia probe. These included Deutsche Bank for records of financial ties between Trump and Russian interests, executives at Twitter over communications between Trump associates and WikiLeaks, first daughter Ivanka Trump, the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, and others.\n\nSchiff also told The Washington Post that Republicans refused to press the attendants of a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which was held to get dirt on Clinton, for a complete and unredacted record of their communications.\n\nNow that the balance of power has shifted in the lower chamber, two sources close to the intelligence and judiciary committees told Insider Democrats will make it a top priority to focus their resources on digging into the Trump-Russia controversy, with an emphasis on financial ties between Trump and Russian interests. And Schiff released a statement this week saying Trump's links to Deutsche Bank will be at the top of the agenda.\n\nNunes, for his part, appeared to acknowledge the gravity of a potential Democratic takeover of the House earlier this year.\n\n\"If [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions won't un-recuse and Mueller won't clear the president, we're the only ones, which is really the danger ... we have to keep all these seats,\" Nunes can be heard saying on a recording from a private fundraiser that aired on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show.\n\n'This will have a seismic effect on the Trump administration'\n\nOusted Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nBut Republicans critical of Mueller notched a significant victory when Trump ousted Sessions on Wednesday and replaced him with his chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker.\n\nWhitaker, a former US attorney from the Southern District of Iowa, is viewed by many as a stalwart Trump supporter who was once reportedly described by White House chief of staff John Kelly as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the DOJ.\n\nA department spokesperson told Insider in an email that Whitaker will assume oversight of the FBI's Russia investigation and Mueller from Rosenstein.\n\nDOJ veterans immediately sounded the alarm, citing Whitaker's past statements and coziness with Trump as reasons the acting attorney general should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia probe, like Sessions did last year.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers also leapt into the fray, with several signaling that they would use their new investigative authority as a check on Trump's power.\n\n\"Why is the president making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller's investigation?\" Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, said in a tweet. \"We will be holding people accountable.\"\n\nSchiff said in a statement that it is \"abundantly clear\" Sessions was forced out for recusing himself from the Russia investigation. Schiff also criticized Whitaker for being \"publicly critical\" of Mueller and said the acting attorney general should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation based on his comments.\n\n\"For two years, the Trump administration has been able to operate without any check-and-balance on their affairs,\" Bardella said. \"Now, every meeting, email, appointment, etc. is subject to congressional oversight. This will have a seismic effect on the Trump administration.\"\n\nTrump, for his part, appears to be gearing up for battle as well. The president said during a freewheeling press conference Wednesday that he would retaliate if Democrats used their subpoena power to obtain his tax returns or reopen the House Russia investigation, adding that he would adopt a \"warlike posture\" to get Senate Republicans to investigate the Democrats in turn.", "Netflix is a streaming giant, but it has yet to break through in the most populated region in the world: Asia.\n\nNetflix has over 130 million subscribers, but it has not exceeded more than 2 million customers in any Asian market, according to Bloomberg.

Directors: Wisit Sasanatieng and Sittisiri Mongkolsiri.\n\nChinese Language Originals", "In my almost 15 years helping students get into America's top colleges, I've received a lot of questions from students and parents about this or that issue, as well as many requests to produce articles or presentations on various topics.\n\nNearly 100% of the questions I continue to receive are tactical, such as:\n\nHow can we build connections with top colleges?\n\nWhat major should my daughter apply for to increase her admissions odds?\n\nShould my son apply early decision (ED) to his dream school even though it's a reach, or should we use ED for a school where he's more competitive?\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWhat parents, students, and I discuss far less often \u2014 but is perhaps as important \u2014 is developing the right college admissions mindset.\n\nHaving the right mindset about your child's college admissions process can increase their confidence and admissions odds, whereas the wrong mindset can sabotage their chances.\n\nTo address this issue, I want to share lessons I've learned from my parents that either helped or hurt my college admissions mindset \u2014 and admissions odds \u2014 many years ago.\n\nLesson 1: Anyone has a chance\n\nAt various points in my life, I've expressed to my dad an intention to achieve something or another, such as receiving a prestigious fellowship.\n\nHis response (in Armenian) has often been: \"Why not? The ones who have done it are human, too.\"\n\nThe lesson he wanted to instill in me was: What you want to achieve is indeed achievable. It doesn't require a supernatural ability. If others have done it, so can you.\n\nI'm sharing this lesson to encourage you to tell your child that their dreams are achievable, rather than getting so caught up in Harvard's admission rate or comparing your child's accomplishments to another student from their school or elsewhere who got into MIT.\n\nAfter all, the students who get into elite schools are human, just like your child.\n\nBy helping your child believe in their admissions odds, they'll be much more likely to put forth their best effort.\n\nRelated: A New York City SAT tutor shares his best advice for students freaking out: 'Make it boring'\n\nLesson 2: Doubting your kids doesn't help\n\nThe tiny high school I attended was founded in 1964. To my knowledge, I am the only student in its 54-year history to ever graduate from an Ivy League university.\n\nIn my childhood community, many consider the ideal to be graduating from a prestigious LA university, such as UCLA or USC, because you can receive a great education while being close to home.\n\nWhen I decided to apply to Ivy League schools over a decade ago, my dad surprisingly asked, \"Do you think you can get in? Those schools aren't for folks like us\" (middle-class immigrants).\n\nWhat he was really saying was, \"I don't think you can get into an Ivy League school.\" This message sharply contrasted with previous statements meant to instill confidence.\n\nFast forward to a few months later when I was getting ready to send my deposit to Cornell. My dad asked, \"Are you sure you'll be able to make it there? Those kids are really smart.\"\n\nAgain, my dad wasn't actually asking me a question. He was expressing doubts about my odds of success.\n\nUnfortunately, what he communicated to me resulted in self-doubt. Would I succeed at Cornell? Are there other areas of my life where I'm being irrationally optimistic?\n\nFortunately, this story has a happy ending (I graduated from Cornell with a 3.9 GPA as a premed student) and I learned a critical lesson: What fills our minds dictates how we feel and the effort we put in.\n\nYou have a choice here: Will you fill your child's mind with positivity or negativity?\n\nRelated: How to write the perfect college essay, according to a dean of admissions\n\nParents sometimes intentionally discourage their students from pursuing a certain goal (e.g., \"We don't want you to apply to that school because it's too far away and we believe that you won't be able to take care of yourself.\").\n\nOther times, they do so unintentionally, thinking they're guiding their child the right way. (e.g., \"As a [White/Korean American/Indian American/etc.] applicant, your odds of getting into that school are slim, especially as a STEM major.\" or \"The competition is crazy these days. I just don't know if she's actually competitive or if we're being unrealistic.\")\n\nI want to assure you that it's completely normal to doubt your child's admissions odds at times, but that it can be incredibly harmful to plant those seeds of doubt in your child's mind. Really, nothing good comes from it.\n\nInstead, validate the doubts your child surely has themselves (e.g., \"You're probably doubting your chances...\") and communicate your belief in them (e.g., \"...but I know you can do it. You've worked so hard to get to this point.\")\n\nLesson 3: Consider the long term\n\nA few years after graduating from Cornell, my parents and I started reminiscing over dinner about the time I moved to the East Coast for school and how my decision served as the foundation for developing a great network of high-achieving friends and fulfilling career.\n\nMy mom and dad stated, almost in unison, that I had \"made the right decision\" in leaving.\n\nMy parents had observed, for instance, how nearly every time I wore my college t-shirt in public\u2014whether in New York City, San Francisco, or Los Angeles \u2014 I would get stopped by a proud fellow alum to chat about our days in school. These conversations often led to contact exchanges, some of which led to important career opportunities.\n\nWhile I had always known that attending Cornell was the right personal, financial, and professional decision for me, it was eye-opening for others to comment on how they had noticed the positive impacts of my decision as well.\n\nWhen thinking about your child's college admissions process, therefore, consider the long term.\n\nRelated: A former Ivy League admissions interviewer says getting rejected from college should feel like being turned down on a dating app\n\nI often hear parents comparing the most prestigious schools their child can get into with those that are \"the right fit,\" as though those two things are mutually exclusive. To me, this comparison is often reflective of anxiety about their child not getting into their true dream school.\n\nIn addition, I've observed numerous times how some parents will enroll their children in high-cost private high schools and summer programs and expect to pay even more for their child's college tuition, but will shy away from investing in application support for their child to get into the best possible school.\n\nThe third example I routinely see is parents discouraging their child from applying to certain dream schools because their odds of getting in are fairly low. Instead, they encourage their child to apply mostly to schools where they're more likely than not to get in. Unfortunately, the student ends up wondering, \"What if I had applied? Was it worth saving the relatively small application fee?\"\n\nPlease encourage your child not only to think positively, but also to dream big and to fully support them in achieving those dreams. The upside is too good not to try.\n\nShirag Shemmassian. Shirag Shemmassian.

A spokesperson for the ride-hailing company didn't offer a reason for removing the feature, but said \"easier and smoother ways to split your fare\" are coming next year.\n\nThe Split Pay feature, which was added in 2014, offered users an in-app method of splitting a fare with up to five people from the phone's contact list.

Boeing's operations manual bulletin that advises airlines on procedures when erroneous readings from one of the plane's sensors lead the aircraft to enter into a sudden dive.\n\nAccording to the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, these erroneous AOA sensor readings may have triggered an abrupt dive that brought down Lion Air Flight JT610 in October.\n\n\"This emergency AD was prompted by analysis performed by the manufacturer showing that if an erroneously high single angle of attack (AOA) sensor input is received by the flight control system, there is a potential for repeated nose-down trim commands of the horizontal stabilizer,\" The FAA said in the directive.\n\n\"This condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain.\"\n\nRead More: The Lion Air Flight 610 crash is the worst airliner accident of 2018\n\nIn addition, the agency found that potentially deadly flaw may manifest itself again in other Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.\n\nAs a result, the FAA has ordered airlines to revise its flight manuals to provide pilots with specific procedures on how to react when these conditions occur.\n\nAirlines are required to make the changes prescribed by the FAA within three days of the receipt of the directive.\n\nLion Air Flight 610 crashed in the Java Sea shortly after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia, on October 28. All 189 people on board the flight were killed. Flight JT610 marked the first fatal crash involving Boeing's next-generation 737 Max aircraft.\n\nThe 737 Max, the fastest-selling plane in Boeing history, is the latest version of the company's 737-family of jets.

That would translate into about $17 more monthly, or $204 annually, given New York's median monthly rent of $2,401.\n\nRead more:Amazon gained a huge perk from its HQ2 contest that's worth far more than any tax break\n\nIn the Washington, DC, area, Zillow found that Amazon's headquarters, if set up entirely in Arlington, could cause rents to rise by 1.1%, more than twice as fast as the 0.5% increase projected without a new Amazon campus.\n\nThat would translate into about $24 more monthly, or $288 annually, for those paying the city's median rent of $2,146.\n\nThe increases in rental costs would kick off next year, assuming Amazon starts hiring for its second headquarters in 2019, according to Zillow.\n\nMore on Amazon's HQ2 project:", "If you're trying to impress a business client with a nice gift, think again before you send over a fruit basket, gift card, or bottle of wine.\n\nAccording to gift-giving expert John Ruhlin, the best gift you can give a client is something a little more unusual: a paring knife.\n\nRuhlin would know. As a 20-year-old college student in 2000, he began selling Cutco knives, and found that the famous cutlery sold even better when framed as a potential business gift. He eventually built his company, the Ruhlin Group, around the art of corporate gift-giving, with Cutco as one of his partners. He wrote the book \"Giftology\" in 2016.\n\nGift-giving is sometimes treated as an afterthought in the corporate world, but Ruhlin says a thoughtful gift to a client can increase a company's referrals and lead to long and meaningful relationships.\n\n\"Our whole goal is to get something in somebody's hands where you're remaining top-of-mind and triggering that memory of it being given by that particular person,\" Ruhlin told Business Insider.\n\nBut why a knife?\n\n\"Most people only focus on business-oriented things when they're doing gifting, or they focus on consumables and gift cards and crap that's not very thoughtful,\" Ruhlin told Business Insider. \"A knife is one of those things that's generic enough that you can give it to anybody, but it's useful and unique enough that it kind of hits people off guard.\"\n\n\"It flies under the radar, it doesn't feel too flashy, but it's one of the things that you end up using.\"\n\nRead more: Here's why we're all so bad at giving gifts people actually want\n\nRuhlin learned from his Cutco days that a good gift communicates that you value not only the recipient, but their inner circle, too. It's best to target areas of their lives where you know they spend lots of time with people close to them \u2014 like the kitchen.\n\n\"Whether you make 50 grand a year or $5 million a year, the hub of everybody's house, the intimate place of their house when they host friends and family, is the kitchen,\" Ruhlin told Business Insider. \"You're either a foodie, you host people, or you're cooking for your kids, or whatever, whether you're in New York or whether you're in Idaho.\"\n\nAs it turns out, Ruhlin's gift idea could end up saving you a few bucks, too. A Cutco paring knife retails between $65 and $72, according to the company's website, while other leading brands such as W\u00fcsthof, Global, and Mac have slightly more affordable options. Meanwhile, a gift fruit basket can exceed $100 from companies such as Williams Sonoma or Harry and David.\n\nOn top of that, if the cutlery is top-quality, you can virtually guarantee that it's going to get used.\n\n\"Most people have crappy tools in the kitchen because they got them, you know, from somebody when they got married or whatever,\" Ruhlin said.\n\n\"So I would tell people, if you send something that's best in class, that's better than anything that they currently have, they'll use it. Especially if it's a utilitarian, practical item.\"", "When money is no object, the world is not only your oyster but your Champagne, caviar, and white truffle, too.\n\nAnd when it comes to holidays, the super-rich sure know how to do it in style.\n\nNaturally, extravagance is the order of the day.

How do you go off and monetize that?\" Well, how we do that is through our business-services platform, our Workonomy strategy.\n\nJerri and her digital marketing team, plus our other two channels, have done a really good job of going back and reactivating customers through digital-marketing-type of capabilities, whether it's email, whether it's PLA, LIA, all these different types of higher returns on marketing investments that really allow us to go back to longtime Office Depot customers and get them excited to come back to the store or, very, very importantly, online, or through our B2B segments.\n\nThey get reengaged with us.

The devices are currently used to provide local calling, messaging, and other in-hotel services, but could potentially pave the way for a wider rollout of smart devices in hotel rooms.\n\nSmartphones provided in hotel rooms could offer a new control mechanism that would allow travelers to interact with smart devices in their rooms. One limitation of smart devices \u2014 like connected lights, thermostats, blinds, and more \u2014 is that they need to be set up and controlled externally through apps, smart speakers, or other other remotes.\n\nFor a short stay in a hotel, where Wi-Fi connections sometimes seem to cut off and require reauthentication for no particular reason, it's generally not worth it for a guest to download any apps or set up controls on their own phones. Tink Labs' phones could provide an alternative that hotels or a partner can set up, maintain, and manage, providing guests with a multipurpose tool to make their stays easier.\n\nCompanies are looking to use a few technologies to enable smart hotels and travel. Marriott tested out both Amazon's Alexa as well as Apple's Siri \u2014 presumably on secured or in-room iPads \u2014 to provide a method of voice control for its hotels.

To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nEtsy reported earnings for Q3 2018, announcing that its revenue grew 41.3% year-over-year (YoY) to almost $150.4 million. Meanwhile, it collected gross merchandise sales (GMS) of $922.5 million for the quarter.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThat's up 20.4% YoY, which is the same growth it posted in Q2 2018, indicating that growth may be slowing after its four quarter-long run of accelerating GMS growth. Still, Etsy's GMS did accelerate on a currency neutral basis this quarter, up to 20.8% YoY from 19.3% YoY last quarter.\n\nEtsy's GMS grew faster than its number of active buyers for the fourth consecutive quarter, suggesting that it's increasing engagement from existing customers, CEO Josh Silverman said on the company's earnings call.\n\nEtsy's number of global active buyers grew 17% YoY to over 37 million consumers, and that's notably less than the 20.4% boost it saw in GMS. Meanwhile, its number of active sellers only rose 8% YoY to 2 million, suggesting that its rising GMS is partially being driven by more sales from existing users.\n\nThis sales growth can be partially attributed to Etsy's efforts to improve its search and discovery experience. The company has been working on making its item pages function more like landing pages, for example. The majority of Etsy's visits that come from search engines direct shoppers to specific item pages, Silverman said.\n\nThis has proven problematic for Etsy because consumers may abandon the site altogether if they don't want that individual product. To keep consumers shopping on Etsy, even if they land on an item page they're not interested in, the company has been adding recommendations and notifications. This gives specific item pages more search capabilities so that consumers can continue their searches on Etsy instead of returning to a search engine, potentially winning more sales from active and new buyers alike.\n\nThe company could boost its performance further if it can get more merchants to offer free shipping, which it's trying to do. Less than 20% of listings on Etsy offered free shipping in Q3, and approximately half of the items on its marketplace are seen as having high shipping prices, according to Silverman. With competitors like Amazon's Handmade, which offers free shipping for over 50,000 items, Etsy may be losing sales because of its lack of free shipping.\n\nTo combat this, Etsy has started educating its sellers on how high shipping costs can hurt sales, and it's started prioritizing products with competitive shipping prices in search. These efforts can both incentivize merchants to lower their shipping costs and make consumers more aware of products with less expensive shipping, helping Etsy win additional sales in the future.", "LONDON \u2014 Theresa May could be handed the power to unilaterally reverse Brexit after a court refused an appeal by her government to block a landmark case on the issue being referred to European courts.\n\nIn September, Edinburgh's Court of Session referred the question of whether the UK can revoke its Article 50 request to leave the EU to the European Court of Justice after a case was brought by a group of Scottish politicians.\n\nThey argued that Article 50 \u2014 which triggered the UK's EU withdrawal process \u2014 can be revoked without the agreement of the other 27 European member states.\n\nHowever, the UK government sought permission to appeal the decision at the UK Supreme Court.\n\nLord Carloway, Scotland's most senior judge, refused the application on Thursday, meaning the case will now proceed to the ECJ as planned, with a provisional date of November 27.\n\nThe case was initially brought by a cross-party group of anti-Brexit politicians including Joanna Cherry, an SNP MP, and lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, director of the Good Law project.\n\nAfter the hearing, Maugham tweeted: \"The government's last-ditch effort to block our attempt to empower Parliament to act in the national interest has failed. Application for permission to appeal refused - and the end of the line for the government.\"\n\n\"The government must now focus on meeting the promises made to voters in the Referendum campaign. If it cannot deliver that deal the people must be asked again - because it has no mandate to drive the country off a cliff.\"\n\n'All just a bad dream'?\n\nREUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nThe court case argues that Article 50, which triggered the UK's EU withdrawal process in March 2017, can be revoked without the agreement of the other 27 European member states.\n\nHanding May's government the unilateral power to reverse Article 50 would allow the UK to retain the perks of its current membership including the economic rebate that Margaret Thatcher negotiated in 1984 and the UK's opt-out from the Euro. These would potentially be lost were Britain forced to seek the approval of the rest of the EU to reverse Brexit.\n\nGunther Oettinger, the EU's Budget Commissioner has previously stated that under those circumstances \"the gradual exit from the rebate would still be kept.\"\n\nJolyon Maugham told BI in October that having the power to unilaterally reverse Brexit \"sweetens the option of remaining\" for the UK government.\n\n\"Plainly it is better for the country if we can unilaterally revoke the Article 50 notice,\" Maugham added. \"In that circumstance, we know that we could treat Brexit as though it was all just a bad dream.\"\n\nMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, has previously said that the EU27 would need to provide their consent to reverse the Brexit process. In that scenario, should the government seek in future to remain in the EU, it could lose the perks of membership it currently enjoys.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether approval from other countries is required for a country to cancel the process because Article 50 has only been triggered once and the process has never been tested in court.\n\nLawyers who argued that the matter is \"hypothetical\" because the government does not intend revoke Article 50 were overruled by Scotland's highest judge in June, who said it was \"neither academic nor premature\" to ask whether it was legally competent to revoke the notice. That means has now been fast-tracked from a Scottish court to the European Court of Justice, where it is expected to be settled in as little as six weeks.\n\nLegal opinion is split on the subject of whether the case will be successful. Those arguing against the viability of the case say handing member states the right to withdraw would undermine the integrity of the two-year notice period which defines Article 50.\n\nHowever, Maugham said he believed the case still has a good prospect of succeeding.\n\n\"It's absolutely fair to say that legal opinion is divided on the matter,\" Maugham told Business Insider. \"I genuinely don't know which way the court will jump.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the Union said that it was considering the decision and added that it was \"committed to implementing the result of the referendum.\"", "Floyd Mayweather's potential MMA debut was canceled almost as quickly as it was announced.\n\nMayweather made headlines on Monday morning when news broke that he would fight undefeated Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa on New Year's Eve, in an event thrown by Japanese MMA brand Rizin.\n\nWhile the terms of the fight \u2014 what weight it would be fought at, the rules, even what gloves the two would wear \u2014 had yet to be determined, Mayweather indicated that the fight was on, announcing it in a now-deleted Instagram post.\n\nJust two days later, the fight was off.

According to Iole, it was difficult to know \"if it's a real fight or something scripted like pro wrestling, or a variant in between.\"\n\nBrendan Schaub, who hosts the podcast \"Below the Belt\" for Showtime, was even more open about his suspicions surrounding the fight.\n\n\"I thought it was a joke,\" Schaub said. \"[Nasukawa]'s a phenomenal southpaw who could kick Floyd Mayweather's face off. ...

Floyd Mayweather is way bigger \u2014 Tenshin is giving up a lot of weight, a lot of height, and the rules are not in place yet.\"\n\n\"There's no way Floyd signs this huge deal with Rizin to get starched by a young up-and-comer,\" Schaub continued. \"Just look at the writing on the wall, man. Something's going on here \u2014 this smells fishy.\"\n\nRobin Black, an MMA expert and analyst, had a similar thought, suggesting it was possible that Rizin, a relatively new and small brand, had brought Mayweather in as a promotional ploy.\n\nMayweather Promotions declined to comment when reached by Business Insider.\n\nMayweather has announced and canceled fights on short notice before. On the night of the Canelo-GGG rematch, Mayweather teased that he would have a rematch Manny Pacquiao \"this year,\" a move that appeared to be little more than a blatant attempt at stealing the thunder of his former opponent. A week later, Mayweather said that the fight would have to wait, because, ironically, he would \"be back in Tokyo for a huge boxing event.\"\n\nNow, with the fight canceled, Mayweather's MMA debut has been postponed, and Rizin and its biggest star have a new level of brand recognition amongst more casual fight fans.\n\nAnd as Mayweather wrote in the final line of his Instagram post announcing that the fight was off, he is still \"a retired boxer that earns an unprecedented amount of money, globally, for appearances, speaking engagements, and occasional small exhibitions.\"", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \"Payments Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Like on most websites, you press an \"upload\" button and either browse for it among your files or drag and drop it into a highlighted area.\n\nOn a Mac, adding a photo to a website is a three-step process: open the browser, open Finder, and drag and drop the file from Finder into the browser.\n\nOn the iPad Pro, I needed to open Safari, swipe from the bottom of the screen to activate the dock, open the Photos app from the dock to activate Split View, and then drag and drop the photo I wanted from one app to the other.\n\nAn extra step, whatever. But dragging and dropping didn't always work. I'd hold my finger to a photo to select it, but when I dragged it to the second app, it changed to a different one that I didn't select. This behavior could be a bug, but it happened every time I tried adding a photo.\n\nUploading a photo to the website was also slower than on my 4-year-old MacBook Pro. And some photos I uploaded automatically rotated 180 degrees. No problem; that's happened on my Mac before. But altering and saving the photo in the correct orientation, which usually does the trick on the Mac, didn't work on the iPad Pro.\n\nNothing would work, and I had no way of correcting the photo unless I did it on my Mac. So that's what I did: I put my brand-new iPad Pro away and finished my work on my MacBook.\n\nRead more: My first impressions of the new iPad Pro: I can't believe how much money I spent on this thing\n\nMy new iPad Pro, Apple Pencil, and Smart Keyboard. Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nIt's difficult to justify a device that's as expensive as a work computer but isn't one\n\nA big part of my disappointment with the iPad Pro was the price.\n\nMy very first iPad \u2014 the third-generation iPad, and the first one with a Retina display \u2014 cost $500 to start. Five hundred dollars is really expensive! And that's before AppleCare and any accessories, like a case.\n\nBut even comparing this new iPad Pro with my iPad Air from 2013, I realized just how little had changed. The new device is obviously faster, but both work about the same.\n\nThe iPad Pro has no functional advantage over any other iPad. All iPads run the same operating system, iOS.\n\nIt's not as if the iPad Pro has a special edge, aside from faster chips. It supports the Apple Pencil, which you'll rarely use unless you're an artist, and the Smart Keyboard, which is massively overpriced for what amounts to a loud keyboard with magnets in it. That's about it. The iPad Pro is basically an invitation to spend money on a deluxe iPad experience \u2014 fun, sure, but yeah, it's not a work computer.\n\nI insist the iPad Pro is not a real work computer because even trying to perform the most basic of tasks felt underwhelming and compelled me to use a laptop instead.\n\nThe iPad will always run iOS, and iOS comes with limitations. Yes, it's easy for users to understand, with all those floating apps you download from the App Store. But the system itself is not nearly as robust or powerful as a desktop operating system like MacOS or Windows.\n\nThat Apple calls the iPad Pro a professional device but won't let it work with a mouse or trackpad or external storage is borderline insulting to customers who need it for professional tasks, as the name would imply. If I can't easily select text or multitask, why would I buy this over a laptop?\n\nBebeto Matthews/AP\n\nThe iPad could be great, but Apple is holding it back\n\nApple needs to stop saying no to iPad functions.\n\nIt's bizarre, because this iPad Pro even adds USB-C for the first time, which is almost like a signal that this device desperately wants to communicate with other gadgets. But Apple's implementation here is half-hearted, and it shows. No external storage or support for computer-like accessories hurts the iPad Pro.\n\nJust as it was for the very first iPad in 2010, the main input method for Apple's tablets is your finger. But Apple needs to realize that people need more than their fingers \u2014 or a Pencil \u2014 to do professional work in 2018.\n\nWe invented the best input methods for computers years ago; they're called mice and trackpads. They offer what fingers can't: precision. The iPad is a step backward for trying to insist that people work a certain way instead of facilitating that work.", "A 12-person jury has been confirmed for the trial of drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzman \u2014 but 27 out of the 60 potential jurors had to be dismissed, some for bizarre reasons.\n\nUS District Judge Brian Cogan is overseeing jury selection, and made public why people had been dismissed during selection which lasted from Monday to Wednesday.\n\nOne man, who reportedly asked the court clerk to help him get El Chapo's autograph, was dismissed on Monday because he admitted: \"I'm a bit of a fan.\"\n\nJust before he was sent packing, El Chapo's lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, asked prosecutors to let the man join the jury, regardless of wanting an autograph, Reuters said.\n\nLichtman's justification was: \"I have the autograph of Charles Manson, and the two leaders of Hamas, and obviously I'm not a big fan of them,\" the news agency reported.

They also tend to have fewer kids. Depending on your personal preferences, neither of those things might be inherently negative, but they're still interesting to note.\n\nFor the study, which was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers in Sweden and the US looked at survey data on roughly 60,000 people in the US and Europe. The researchers, Kimmo Eriksson; Irina Vartanova; Pontus Strimling; and Brent Simpson, wanted to know: How was prosociality \u2014 i.e. interest in other people, the opposite of selfishness\u2014 connected to both income and parenthood?\n\nTo measure prosociality, the researchers focused on prosocial motivations \u2014 for example, believing that people should be willing to help others who are less fortunate \u2014 as well as prosocial behavior \u2014for example, actually donating money to charity.\n\nResults showed that the most prosocial/least selfish people had the most children. When it came to money, for the most part, people who were moderately prosocial \u2014 i.e. mostly unselfish \u2014 earned the highest income. (One piece of data yielded different results: The most prosocial/least selfish people earned the highest incomes.)\n\nTwo of the surveys the researchers analyzed were conducted over an extended period of time. And while this doesn't necessarily prove that prosociality directly causes you to earn more money or have more kids, they do seem to be related in some way.\n\nRead more:Being a 'nice guy' becomes a threat to men's earning power as soon as they turn 30\n\nGiving (some) of your time and energy can pay off in the long run\n\nAs for why less selfish people should earn more and have more kids, that's beyond the scope of this study. Yet the researchers cite the work of Wharton professor Adam Grant, who has found that \"givers\" are generally more successful than \"takers.\"\n\nGrant's insights line up with the new finding that moderately prosocial people make more money. Grant has said that it's important to be an effective giver, or else you run the risk of burning out. For example, Grant recommends grouping your favors and doing them all on a single day so they're less likely to interfere with your personal work.\n\nThe researchers behind the new study also conducted an experiment to see if people are aware that prosociality pays off. Interestingly, people generally believed that selfishness was linked to more money (incorrect) and fewer children (correct).\n\nTo be sure, the study findings don't suggest that people who opt not to have kids are egomaniacs. That's hardly the case. Nor is a small paycheck evidence that you must be a self-absorbed jerk.\n\nBut, especially if you're thinking about how to succeed in the workplace, it's worth being aware of the importance of relationships with other people \u2014 how you can help them and how they can help you.", "REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nSquare on Wednesday reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and profits, but its fourth-quarter profits guidance disappointed.\n\nThe mobile-payment provider posted adjusted earnings of $0.13 a share on adjusted revenue of $431 million, beating the $0.11 and $414 million that Wall Street analysts surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting.\n\nLooking ahead, Square says it sees fourth-quarter earnings of $0.12 to $0.13 a share.

It is designed to automatically find times for a meeting that don't clash with attendees' schedules, including travel times, to let users collaboratively edit events at the same time, and to display a user's daily itinerary graphically on a map so they can understand where they need to be and when.\n\n\"It's kind of like a mashup of what would happen if Google Docs, Google Maps, and Google Calendar all got married,\" Campos told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nWoven\n\nThe idea for Woven was born out of Campos' and Arpat's time at Facebook, Campos said, as he saw the difficulties users had with scheduling events and managing their time effectively. \"My job at Facebook was productivity of the workforce,\" Campos said.

There's a ton of different things you can build on top of this graph engine. We basically built the same technology at Facebook, so you've seen a bit of this movie before.\"\n\nWoven\n\nOne of these additional applications the company is exploring is analytics. In the long term, Woven hopes to target enterprise clients as a way to make money (the initial app is free to download) and to offer companies insights on their workforces to make them more efficient: how long do people spend traveling between meetings; what kind of meetings are best-attended; and so on.\n\nWoven also builds additional functionality onto calendar events. It lets users tag meetings with their own categories (which could then feed into analytics), or keep private notes for each event \u2014 and the startup plans to let users add documents to meetings and even rate them on whether they were a good use of time.\n\nCampos even suggested it could one day sync with sleep-tracking data \u2014 letting users quantify almost every aspect of their life with analytics, and see how work schedules might affect users' rest.\n\nThe calendar \"hasn't changed in 20 years,\" Campos said.\n\nGot a tip?

The company raised $8 million in funding from five investors.\n\nBut after realizing their bikes were only doing about one ride per day, the company shifted to scooters \u2014 and now sees each vehicle make upwards of eight trips per day. This has allowed it to break even on a per-unit basis, Poon said, calling the revenue of $20-30 per day per scooter \"a far cry\" from what the company saw with bikes.\n\n\"Cities are really starting to recognize the benefit of micro-mobility solutions,\" Poon said in an interview. \"Ultimately our product solves a real problem for users and provides an equitable mode of transport, provided the proper policy framework is in place.\"\n\nSpin currently operates in nine cities and on five college campuses, and has eager ambitions to reach 100 markets in the next 18 months. Ford sees the initial contact with cities on scooters as a way to form relationships with cities that could eventually turn into self-driving car agreements.\n\n\"You can't just show up in a city and say 'Hi, I have an autonomous vehicle and we'd like to participate now',\" said Ford's Klevorn. \"We think its important to have the relationships with a city, build trust, and learn about their challenges and issues.\"", "Tesla announced it has a new chair on Thursday.\n\nThe electric car company has appointed Robyn Denholm, the CFO of Australia's largest telecoms firm Telstra, as the woman to oversee its board.\n\nShe replaces CEO Elon Musk, who had to step down as chairman for at least three years as part of a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission after his infamous \"funding secured\" tweet.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Tesla's new chair, Robyn Denholm:\n\n1. Robyn Denholm has been on the Tesla board since 2014\n\nDenholm has been an independent director at Tesla for four years. She was the first woman to join the board of nine, which includes Musk and his brother, Kimbal.\n\nAmong her duties as a board member, she chaired Tesla's audit committee, which provides oversight of the company's accounting and financial reporting.\n\n2. She's CFO at Australia's largest telecoms firm \u2014 but she's only been in the role for a month\n\nDenholm is CFO at Telstra, Australia's biggest telecommunications company, and will be leaving the company after her six month notice period is up. She'll get to work as Tesla's chair immediately, however.\n\nShe only took up her role as CFO in October. Telstra's CEO Andy Penn told the Sydney Morning Herald: \"We know that it has become increasingly difficult to balance her responsibilities as Telstra CFO with the increased activity of the Tesla board.\"\n\n3. She was named in a lawsuit along with the rest of the board for failing to curb Musk's erratic behavior\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by a shareholder, who claims that Tesla's board \"breached their fiduciary duties \" by allowing Musk to lie about the company having obtained funding to go private.\n\n\"Despite being put on notice of [Musk's] propensity for erratic public communications that have harmed the Company and its stockholders, the Board consciously disregarded his actions and failed to do anything,\" the suit alleged.\n\n4. Denholm was part of a special committee that looked at taking Tesla private\n\nShe formed part of a three-person committee along with fellow directors Brad Buss and Linda Johnson Rice in August. The committee was announced on August 14, seven days after Musk's \"funding secured\" tweet on August 7.\n\n5. She'll get a $300,000 retainer fee plus stock options\n\nA Tesla spokesperson told CNBC that in her new post, Denholm will receive 8,000 in stock options each year on top of a $300,000 retainer.\n\n6. She's no stranger to the tech and auto industry\n\nPrevious to working at Telstra, Denholm held positions at Juniper Networks, Sun Microsystems, and Toyota Australia. She loves Tesla because it mixes her passions for tech and the auto industry.\n\n\"I am a car enthusiast and am passionate about innovation, so Tesla is the perfect board role for me,\" she told executive search firm Odgers Berndtson earlier this year.\n\n7. She's not James Murdoch\n\nTesla board member James Murdoch, son of billionaire Rupert Murdoch, was touted by the Financial Times as the frontrunner to replace Musk. However, Musk himself quashed the Times's report, tweeting \"This is incorrect.\"\n\nAlthough he was reported as the favourite, Murdoch's wasn't the only name to be floated as Musk's potential successor. Former Vice President Al Gore was also mooted as a potential successor.\n\nTesla director James Murdoch. Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for National Geographic\n\n8. Her parents owned a gas station\n\nDenholm is taking the helm at the world's most famous electric car company, but as a child, she reportedly tinkered with cars at her parents' gas station in Milperra, New South Wales.\n\n9. She had a Tesla on order before joining the firm\n\nWhile her childhood may have been filled with petrol cars, she was fascinated by Tesla before even joining the company's board. Denholm said she had a Model S on order before she was approached by Tesla. She is now on to her third Tesla vehicle.\n\nTesla Model S. REUTERS/Noah Berger\n\n10. She has the Elon Musk Twitter seal of approval\n\nMusk's Twitter activity has been a thorn in the side of Tesla's board, but on Thursday he welcomed her appointment on his platform of choice.", "We're well into the fourth quarter, and investment banks are still raiding each other for senior-level, cream-of-the-crop talent.\n\nThat's not how it usually works.\n\nIf you hire a top banker now, you'll likely have to cover the bonus they would've earned at their previous shop \u2014 a pricey proposition that amounts to paying them for a year of work they did for a rival. Heading into November, Wall Street firms are typically sitting tight with what they've got and hunkering down to close out the year on a strong foot.\n\nBut this isn't a typical year \u2014 not by a long shot.\n\nFor starters, there's been an unprecedented amount of shakeups at the highest ranks of bulge-bracket investment banks: Citigroup reorganized its investment bank; David Solomon took over for Lloyd Blankfein as CEO of Goldman Sachs; and investment banking honcho Christian Meissner left Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nWhen key dominoes at the top of a bank fall, it can have a cascading effect: The new power brokers pick their own lieutenants, who in turn have their own favorites, and loyalists to the old guard can find themselves on the outside looking in.\n\nAccording to top Wall Street headhunters, this is the most active year of hires and departures by senior investment bankers since the financial crisis.\n\nWe reviewed reports and spoke with executives at several premier investment-banking search firms and found nearly 300 hires or departures at the managing director level or higher in the US this year.\n\nJulie Choi, CEO of CBK Partners, formerly known as Choi & Burns, said 2018 was the most robust year of hiring among the senior ranks \u2014 both in terms of quality and quantity \u2014 she's seen since the meltdown in 2008.\n\nIn part, this is because it's not just boutiques and independents picking off talent from global investment banks anymore.\n\n\"In past years, bulge-bracket firms were filling roles as departures occurred, which created a musical chairs between one firm and another. That doesn't really reflect growth,\" Choi said. \"What's really different this year is that every firm is looking to take the hill \u2014 both independent and bulge bracket.\"\n\nLook no further than Goldman Sachs. Historically reticent to make senior lateral hires, the investment bank has brought in at least 13 dealmaker MDs in the US this year, many of them at the partner level, like ex-JPMorgan deal wizard Kurt Simon, who joined Goldman in August.\n\nThis intense level of activity makes sense, considering the record level of dealmaking we've seen in 2018.\n\n\"You want to make hay while the sun shines,\" Albert Laverge, head of the corporate and investment banking practice for Egon Zehnder, told Business Insider. \"People don't want to wait till Q2 to have somebody in place. Considering how much activity there is, waiting till June 1? It's just too long. Banks are taking a longer view, hiring now.\"\n\nHiring volume has largely tracked with the hottest sectors in investment banking \u2014 technology, media, and telecom has been the most active for MD-level hires, followed by healthcare, according to Laverge.\n\nLike Choi, Laverge noted that it was the most active year in hiring he's seen since before the financial crisis.\n\n\"What I do find notable is how active the landscape is. It's November and announcements are still coming,\" Laverge said.\n\nWe're hearing that banks are still actively searching and looking to hire, so there could still be some shoes yet to drop in 2018. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which has had a dismal year in dealmaking, is reportedly looking to hire 50 senior dealmakers to boost its banking business.\n\nGiven the inordinate amount churn this year, Business Insider put together a list of the most notable moves of 2018. We worked with a handful of senior headhunters who live and breath this industry to winnow that list of nearly 300 moves down to the 40 biggest of 2018.\n\nYou can check out that list here.", "According to top Wall Street headhunters, 2018 has been the most active year of hires and departures by senior investment bankers in recent memory.\n\nWe reviewed reports and spoke with executives at several premier investment-banking search firms and found nearly 300 moves at the managing-director level or higher in the US this year.\n\nJulie Choi, the CEO of CBK Partners, formerly known as Choi & Burns, said 2018 had been the most robust year of hiring among the senior ranks \u2014 in terms of both quality and quantity \u2014 she had seen since the meltdown in 2008.\n\nAlbert Laverge, the head of the corporate- and investment-banking practice for Egon Zehnder, told Business Insider the same.\n\nWhat's changed in 2018? A few dynamics are at work:\n\nAn unprecedented number of shakeups at the highest ranks of bulge-bracket investment banks \u2014 Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and UBS have all seen their power structures revamped.\n\nIt's not just boutiques and independents picking off talent from global investment banks anymore. \"In past years, bulge-bracket firms were filling roles as departures occurred, which created a musical chairs between one firm and another.

Typically, smartwatches only come in two or three options, but the Fossil sport will come in silver, gold, dark gray, red, blue, and pink.\n\nMore varied color options, and more brightly colored options at that, seems to be a trend this fall: in September, Apple introduced the iPhone XR, which comes in six bright colors.\n\n\"We know our consumers want versatility both in their activity and their accessories, which is why we wanted to bring a smartwatch to market that is a fit for every style,\" Steve Evans, executive vice president of Fossil Group, said in a press release about the new watch.\n\nThe Fossil Sport will also come in two case sizes, 41 mm and 43 mm, which are roughly the same sizes as an Apple Watch Series 4 (though, clearly, a different shape).\n\nRead more:Google made some subtle changes to its smartwatch operating system, Wear OS \u2014 and it proves that a little bit goes a long way\n\nFossil\n\nA new and improved chip\n\nThe Fossil Sport is among the first smartwatches to contain the new Snapdragon Wear 3100 chip from Qualcomm.\n\nThe new chip should make a major difference in battery life, which has been one of the main issues holding smartwatches back. For its part, Fossil says the Sport watch should get 24 hours of battery life, plus an additional two days in battery saver mode, which is a feature of the new chip.\n\nThe new chip should also provide a few other nice features, like an enhanced \"ambient mode\" and some better watch faces, although Fossil hasn't given much more detail than that.\n\nBeyond the new chip, the Fossil Sport will come preloaded with the updated Wear OS, Google's smartwatch operating system.

In the year to September, inflation stood at 488,000%.\n\nMonthly inflation actually fell somewhat, with that figure falling to 147% in October from 233% in September.\n\nRead more: 10 pictures reveal the huge amounts of cash Venezuelans need to buy everyday things\n\nThis week's figures may seem troubling, but things are set to get even worse for Venezuelans, with the International Monetary Fund arguing that the country's annual inflation rate is likely to pass 1 million percent this year.\n\n\"The collapse in economic activity, hyperinflation, and increasing deterioration ... will lead to intensifying spillover effects on neighboring countries,\" the director of the IMF's Western Hemisphere Department said in a blog post in July.\n\nVenezuela's situation has drawn comparisons to the hyperinflation incidents seen in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s and in Weimar Germany after World War I.\n\nLocal economists, Reuters reports, also say hyperinflation could become even more aggressive in the final months of the year. That's because public-sector workers are given bonuses ahead of the holiday season that could boost purchasing power and push the cost of goods up even more.\n\nThe data is the latest to suggest that measures introduced by the country's embattled president, Nicolas Maduro, are failing to achieve their aims. Maduro announced a series of radical economic interventions over the summer that were designed to bring down inflation and stabilize the Venezuelan economy.\n\nMaduro's policies included devaluing Venezuela's currency, the bol\u00edvar, by 95% and pegging it to the state-backed cryptocurrency, the petro.\n\nWith the policies failing to have any real impact, the continued hyperinflation of goods means everyday items are unaffordable for many Venezuelans, and poverty and violence are widespread in the country.\n\nNews of Venezuela's still-surging inflation rate comes just days after reports that the country has approached the Bank of England about getting back approximately 15 tonnes of gold bullion held in the UK.\n\nCiting two sources with direct knowledge of the operation, Reuters said the plans related to recently announced sanctions by the US aimed at disrupting the South American country's gold exports.\n\nUS President Donald Trump last week signed an executive order barring Americans from dealing with entities and people involved with \"corrupt or deceptive\" gold sales from Venezuela.", "Trade-war fears, ongoing Brexit negotiations, and the crisis surrounding Italy's budget are all dragging on the German economy.\n\nTraditionally strong exports have disappointed in four of past six months.

That's not all: \"Temporary production-related problems and capacity bottlenecks are dampening the pace of expansion,\" the report said.\n\nEurope's largest exporter has also seen trade out of the country fall dramatically, with exports dropping 0.8% month-on-month in September. Exports could continue to suffer in the event of a no-deal Brexit or new tariffs on autos out of the US as part of US President Donald Trump's trade war. Export numbers dropped in four of the past six months and business confidence has been waning as investment opportunities weaken on geopolitical uncertainty, ING said.\n\nAutomakers are suffering, too\n\nGermany's malaise dampened the results of auto giants such as BMW.

There would need to be an economic hard landing.\"\n\nWhile that may seem like a daunting prospect, Hyzy says there are ways to read the tea leaves and recognize a looming hard landing as it approaches. The key is the yield curve, which looks at Treasury bonds of different maturities in relation to one another.\n\nAccording to Hyzy, the dreaded hard landing would correspond with an inversion of the yield curve comparing 10- and 30-year Treasurys \u2014 a situation in which the nearer-term bonds would be yielding more than their longer-maturity counterparts.\n\nConsidering that most hard landings (and recessions) throughout history have been coupled with deep stock losses, a bear market may not be much further behind.\n\nGoing beyond a sudden economic collapse, Hyzy is also closely watching oil prices. He says that if the price of West Texas Intermediate crude climbs above $100, and Brent crude rises above $125, that could be another major sign that an equity bear market is near.\n\nAfter all, it would raise costs for both consumers and companies \u2014 hardly an encouraging combination for lasting stock market prosperity. Corporations in particular would find it extremely difficult to keep growing profits in such a scenario.\n\nHyzy says a third potential signal of a looming hard landing would be if credit spreads were to widen aggressively, especially in the high-yield, low-quality realm.\n\n\"When delinquencies and defaults start to go up, then balance sheets start to deteriorate, even though the broader economic landscape isn't showing that yet,\" he said. \"That's where I'd get defensive.\"\n\nStill, it's important to note that none of these situations are Hyzy's base case. He's particularly skeptical that oil prices will reach the lofty levels he's outlined above.\n\nWith that said, it's usually the outcome you're not expecting that throws you for the biggest loop. So traders would be best advised to keep an eye on all the triggers listed above and react accordingly when they start to flare. Because even if conditions seem safe right now, they can change quickly.\n\n\"There are pockets of concern that are stirring the pot,\" Hyzy said. \"But unless there's an economic hard landing, and earnings growth goes into a recession, this bull market can continue.\"", "A prominent research group in Switzerland has put together a list of \"estimated transfer values\" for the most expensive footballers in Europe \u2014 and the veteran striker Cristiano Ronaldo barely makes the list.\n\nThe FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been kicked out of the top five, as younger players continue to replace two of soccer's most established superstars.\n\nFootball think tank CIES Football Observatory adopts a \"scientific perspective\" to its methodology, taking into consideration six factors when putting a price on the head of Europe's top players:\n\nPlayer performance: The quality and consistency of their form Player performance in relation to their club: Are they the star player?

engagement with the region to a new level,\" the prime minister said Thursday.\n\n\"While we have natural advantages in terms of history, proximity and shared values, Australia cannot take its influence in the southwest Pacific for granted, and too often we have,\" Morrison said.\n\nMorrison announced new defense force mobile-training team, annual meetings of defense, police, and border security chiefs, and new diplomatic posts in a number of Pacific countries.\n\nThe centerpiece will be a $2 billion AUD financial facility to help fund major regional projects while the existing export financing agency (EFA) will be boosted by another one billion dollars.\n\nReferring to Australia's 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper, Morrison said the stability and economic progress of the Pacific region are of \"fundamental importance,\" and no single country can tackle the challenges on its own.\n\nMorrison announced his Pacific Pivot ahead of a milestone meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other Asia-Pacific regional leaders next week at the APEC forum in Papua New Guinea.\n\nMorrison said it was time Australia opened a \"new chapter in relations with our

\"Let there be no doubt: in the Asia-Pacific in the 21st century, the United States of America is all-in.\"\n\nThat was about the zenith of the much-vaunted pivot, and at around exactly the same time

bilateral lender, although Australia's significant aid programs mean it remains the largest financial backer in the South Pacific.\n\nWhile China has always maintained a political stake in the region as part of its ongoing diplomatic chess battle with Taiwan, the sheer magnitude and speed of Chinese assistance eventually raised alarms and even hysteria among Western-aligned nations that the string of southern Pacific island states was very quickly falling under Beijing's influence.\n\nBut if Australia's backyard was finding itself over a Beijing barrel, then Morrison put his hand up for the first time to acknowledge that Australia and its major allies, the US foremost amongst them, wore some of the blame for that and had neglected the region for too long.\n\nAustralia, he said, had taken the Pacific and its nations \"for granted.\" Speaking from a military facility in Townsville where US troops are based, Morrison redrew the Pacific's strategic importance to Australia's foreign and

According to both Mark Bowden's \"Killing Pablo\" and Escobar's son, the Medellin drug boss paid the rebels $1 million for the job.\n\nDuring a radio broadcast from inside the court after the rebels seized the building, an M19 member said that their aim was \"to denounce a Government that has betrayed the Colombian people.\"\n\nThe initial response of Betancur was, \"Restore order, but above all avoid bloodshed.\" But after that, he reportedly \"encouraged the army to do its dirty work in the name of preserving legality\" and refused to end the siege.\n\nHe also refused to take phone calls from the president of the Supreme Court, Justice Alfonso Reyes, who was being held hostage, or to order a ceasefire to permit negotiations.\n\nSmoke billows from a 2-foot-wide hole made by a cannon round from an armored car at the Palace of Justice, early on November 7, 1985.

In the process, they reportedly rescued about 100 of the hostages. Colombian security forces soon launched more attacks on the rebels, eventually using tanks to assault the building.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a fire broke out and destroyed many of the documents that court was using to decide whether to extradite drug traffickers. Records for about 6,000 criminal cases were destroyed, including files for the criminal case against Escobar, according to Bowden.\n\nIn 1989, a judge ruled that the fire had been intentionally set.

A report composed after the attack contained photos that suggested some hostages were killed by someone other than the rebels.\n\nIn June 2010, Plazas, who led the army's assault, was convicted of the forced disappearance of 11 people who survived the attack on the building but were taken away by the army afterward and never seen again.\n\nRescue workers remove Colombian Supreme Court Justice Humberto Murcia from the Palace of Justice after troops stormed the building, November 7, 1985.

In a 2012 session of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), IACHR President Jose de Jesus \"was unequivocal in his conviction that Colombian authorities had 'coordinated' torture and forced disappearances\" during the Palace siege.\n\nIn that same session, the Colombian government admitted it deserved some blame for the deaths and disappearances, with a government representative saying that \"the Colombian state will not cease efforts to know the truth and create justice.\"\n\nSince that admission, investigations and accusations have continued. A lawyer working for many of the families of the disappeared said a 2013 Truth Commission showed that some in the military knew of M19's plot but let it happen, hoping to launch a \"ferocious response\" against the guerrillas.\n\nA Colombian soldier with an assault rifle prepares to lay down covering fire as other soldiers prepare to storm the Palace of Justice, November 6, 1985.

Jesus Armando Arias was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted for the forced disappearance of a judge, several court workers, and Irma Franco Pineda, an M19 guerrilla who was seen leaving the building alive.\n\nThe convictions of Plazas and Arias were seen by many as positive steps after so many years of impunity for abuses committed during the siege and throughout recent Colombian history. Others have see it as insufficient.\n\n\"The basic truth, which we have always longed for, has not been provided because there has not been a policy by the state to seek out the truth behind the events,\" said Jorge Franco Pineda, Irma's brother, in 2014.\n\nAn armored vehicle crashes through the two-story wooden doors at the front of the Palace of Justice, as soldiers and policemen prepare to rush inside, November 6, 1985.

The group frequently kidnapped victims for ransom, and the abduction of the sister of a prominent member of Escobar's Medellin cartel in 1981 is believed to have led traffickers to form \"self-defense groups,\" which eventually led to the formation of right-wing paramilitary groups.\n\nBut the M19's demobilization became an example for future transitions. A number of right-wing laid down their arms in the mid-2000s. A peace deal between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a left-wing group, and the Colombian government was approved in late 2016, and that group has formed a political party with the same initials.\n\nMany of rebels and guerrillas who've disarmed have turned to criminal activity, and political violence has persisted.

Other senior Justice Department officials, including deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and solicitor general Noel Francisco, were also reportedly at the send-off.\n\nAfter months-long reports of a frayed relationship with Trump, the former attorney general offered his resignation in an undated letter.\n\nTwo months after Trump became president, Sessions attracted his ire after recusing himself from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nSessions, who backed Trump early on in his 2016 presidential campaign, cited a Justice Department regulation that prohibits officials from investigating campaigns they were involved in.\n\nTrump publicly berated Sessions in fiery statements and tweets as the months dragged on, fueling rumors Sessions would be on his firing line.

Brian Sandoval has dubbed \"Innovation Park.\" It surrounds an industrial park with Tesla's Gigafactory and buildings of major tech giants like Google and Apple.\n\nThe company that Berns founded, Blockchains LLC, bought the property earlier this year for $170 million, according to The Times. Berns could fund the entire project \u2014 including the $300 million he's already put in \u2014 with money he acquired from investing in ether, the cryptocurrency powered by the Ethereum blockchain, in 2015.\n\n\"Something inside me tells me this is the answer,\" Berns told The Times, \"that if we can get enough people to trust the blockchain, we can begin to change all the systems we operate by.\"\n\nBerns said that Blockchains planned to begin construction of the city in late 2019 at the earliest but that the company still needed to develop a master plan and get county approval.\n\nCheck out some of the designs for a blockchain-based utopia in the Nevada desert:", "A Republican House candidate who allegedly \"liked\" and shared a number of controversial social media posts, including a lewd drawing of Bigfoot, defeated his Democratic opponent by a sizeable margin on Tuesday.\n\nRepublican Denver Riggleman, a Trump-backed brewery owner, won Virginia's 5th Congressional District with 53.3% of the vote, compared to Democrat Leslie Cockburn's 46.7%, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn July, Riggleman's social media habits were scrutinized after Cockburn, an award-winning investigative journalist, shared a screenshot of an Instagram post in which Riggleman shared a lewd image of Bigfoot \u2014 the hairy, humanoid creature from North American folklore.\n\nRiggleman described his image as a \"#matinghabitsofbigfoot\" cover art, and noted in the caption, \"I hide nothing in this magnificent tome. Don't erase the censor box.\"\n\nCockburn described the sighting as \"Bigfoot erotica,\" and said in a tweet that \"this is not what we need on Capitol Hill.\"\n\nThe Representative-elect has since made his Instagram private for his 295 followers, and reportedly said his picture was merely a joke between his military friends.\n\nRiggleman also drew criticism after \"liking\" several Facebook pages that shared controversial material, including political messages couched in sexual innuendo.

Whitaker is widely seen as a Trump loyalist and was once reportedly described by chief of staff John Kelly as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the DOJ.\n\nA DOJ spokesperson said in an email that Whitaker will assume oversight over the Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\nJens David Ohlin, a vice dean at Cornell Law School and an expert in criminal law, didn't mince words when reacting to the news.\n\n\"This is a disturbing development,\" Ohlin told INSIDER in an email. \"The nation's eyes are on Mr. Whitaker and how he discharges his responsibility to oversee the Mueller investigation.\"\n\nJeffrey Cramer, a longtime former federal prosecutor who spent 12 years at the Justice Department, told INSIDER it was \"safe to say this news wasn't shocking to Mueller.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the timing, but everyone knew Sessions' tenure was limited,\" Cramer added. \"We should see grand jury action or a report soon. Whitaker could try to slow-walk future efforts to sit on a report. But it's naive to think the new Democratic House of Representatives just sits there and watches.\"\n\nIndeed, Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler \u2014 the ranking member on the powerful House Judiciary Committee \u2014 said in a tweet that Americans \"must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind\" Trump's decision to remove Sessions.\n\n\"Why is the president making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller's investigation?\" Nadler added. \"We will be holding people accountable.\"\n\nDemocrats will assume official control of the House of Representatives in January, and several lawmakers have made clear that they intend to exercise more oversight of the executive branch in their new role.\n\n\"At the time when we formally take control of the House ... we'll have to see what Bob Mueller has been able to do and what Bob Mueller has been able to say either via indictment or via report, and that will also guide what we intend to do in our committee,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC on Tuesday.\n\nSchiff struck a far more ominous tone Wednesday, following Sessions' ouster, saying in a statement that Trump's move \"places the Special Counsel's investigation in new and immediate peril.\"\n\nSaying that it is \"abundantly clear\" that Sessions was forced out for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, Schiff criticized Whitaker for being \"publicly critical\" of Mueller and said the acting attorney general should recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation.\n\n'Will Whitaker on his own, or under Trump's direction, try to shut down or constrain Mueller's investigation?'\n\nAndrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nWhitaker said in a CNN op-ed shortly before he was hired as Sessions' chief of staff that \"Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\"\n\nWhitaker added that his concerns stemmed from reports that the special counsel was probing the Trump Organization's financial records, saying the move \"falls completely outside of the realm\" of Mueller's mandate.\n\nBut in a letter outlining the scope of Mueller's appointment last year, Rosenstein gave Mueller broad authority to not only investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated\" with Trump's campaign, but examine \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\n\nWhitaker has also publicly mused about how an acting attorney general could go about defunding the Mueller probe.\n\n\"I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt,\" Whitaker said during a July 2017 interview with CNN.\n\nIn the wake of Sessions' removal, several prominent Democratic lawmakers began calling for Whitaker to recuse himself from overseeing Mueller, arguing that his previous comments on the investigation hurt his ability to remain impartial.\n\nDOJ veterans voiced similar concerns.\n\n\"Will Whitaker on his own, or under Trump's direction, try to shut down or constrain Mueller's investigation?\" Alex Whiting, a former federal prosecutor in Boston and Washington, DC, told INSIDER in an email. \"That's the worry here.\"\n\nSessions' removal also sparked immediate speculation over whether it was another piece in the growing obstruction-of-justice case Mueller has been building against Trump since last year. But experts cautioned against reading too much into it.\n\n\"Sessions' ouster is another data point, but obstruction is still hard to prove,\" Cramer said. \"It certainly increases the number of questions Mueller would like to ask Trump.\"\n\nWhiting agreed, saying the move likely wouldn't significantly add to the obstruction inquiry unless Trump personally directed Sessions or Whitaker to block the investigation. Whiting said he's more concerned Whitaker will slow-walk the inquiry instead of shutting it down all together.\n\nSessions' removal on Wednesday was not entirely unexpected \u2014 several media reports said that the former attorney general was prepared to resign or be fired after the midterm elections.\n\nAt the heart of Trump's frustration with Sessions was his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation after it surfaced last year that he had misled the Senate about his contacts with Russia.\n\nCramer said Sessions was right to recuse himself.\n\n\"Any prosecutor would recuse themselves from a case where they could be a witness,\" Cramer said. \"It is the one time Sessions acted like a true prosecutor and not a politician. It is ironic that it was his undoing in this administration.\"", "A Taiwanese man has earned the nickname Uncle Pok\u00e9mon after gaining international attention for his outrageous dedication to \"Pok\u00e9mon Go.\" Recent photos show Chen San-yuan, 70, using a waist-mounted rig to play the mobile video game on 11 different phones at the same time.\n\nSan-yuan first garnered virual attention in May, when photos of the elderly man playing \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\" on a bike-mounted setup with six phones surfaced on Reddit.

My name is Rishab Jain. I'm in 8th grade, 13 years old, from Portland, Oregon, and I created an artificial intelligence-based tool called PCDLS Net to improve pancreas tracking during a treatment called radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe five-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer is around 9%, and the 10-year survival rate is around 1%, which is extremely low, and these survival rates have not improved significantly in the past 40 years, so currently, pancreatic cancer is detected in a late stage, and by then, doctors try to use radiotherapy to help treat it, but most of the time, it's not effective enough, so I got inspired to do some research on this because I'm a big programmer, and I like artificial intelligence, so I wondered if I could combine my knowledge in the two areas to help solve the problem, and I created an artificial intelligence-based tool called PCDLS Net to improve pancreas tracking during a treatment called radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer.\n\nI contacted over 253 doctors, and got around 30 replies from leading experts from institutions at cancer centers and around the world. So as you can see in the pancreas right here, there's other organs such as the stomach and liver that may cover the area, and also, it's right below the lungs causing it to move during some of the treatments. It's also very hard to reach in. It's right in the center of the abdomen next to the spinal cord, so for surgery, biopsies, other things like that, it may be hard to find where the pancreas is. It's sometimes detailed as a mushy or angry organ because of its position in the body.\n\nThis right here is a real patient's CT scan, and as you can see throughout its transforming, it's very hard for the human eye to detect where the pancreas is, and this is especially a problem in real time when radiologists and oncologists have to find the pancreas and apply radiation treatment. So over here on the left side, my tool can be run to find where exactly the pancreas is in one of these CT or MRI slices and output this result instantaneously. So currently, doctors have to apply sometimes a seven-millimeter overlay around the pancreas of radiation, and this can affect millions of healthy cells, so my tool is able to reduce that area to around four millimeters, so that saves millions of healthy cells and can improve patient quality of care.\n\nText on screen: For his invention, Rishab Jain won the 2018 Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge. For his award, he received a $25,000 prize.\n\nRishab Jain: So, I have a detailed five-year plan about how I wanna globally commercialize my tool, PCDLS Net, and improve pancreatic cancer survival rates. So I envision partnering with a hospital as well as 3M to work and create my tool as an add-on, and for this, I'll need to conduct clinical testing, so I want to gain FDA and IRB approval. So I want to continue pursuing medicine and engineering as I grow up, so for my undergraduate degree, I'm thinking about becoming a biomedical engineer, and later, I want to make a difference in other people's lives.\n\nI've gotten to see first-hand some of my relatives who are doctors and how they can perform surgery or make other treatments that improve the quality of care and solve problems for people in need, so I'm thinking about becoming a surgeon and continuing medical research as I grow up.", "One of Goldman Sachs' most active investment-banking units just promoted two tech bankers to partner \u2014 one of the most coveted titles on Wall Street.\n\nBarry O'Brien and Ward Waltemath both woke up early on Wednesday to calls from Goldman's president, John Waldron, congratulating them on their new roles.

The packaging of the iPad Pro, Apple Pencil, and Smart Keyboard is very elegant. You don't need to tear anything open like an animal; everything peels away and unhooks from itself like it's designed that way. It feels very high-end.

Unless you plan on exclusively using the iPad's touchscreen for typing, I would highly recommend buying a keyboard accessory with this new iPad, or any iPad, really. I've owned and used Logitech's Ultrathin Keyboard for years now, on my 2013 iPad Air, but I wanted to give Apple's latest Smart Keyboard a try. The positives: The keyboard feels soft but sturdy, and it easily hooks onto the iPad Pro. The negatives: It's loud, and you almost have to \"punch\" the keys with your fingers for them to register.\n\nUnless you plan on exclusively using the iPad's touchscreen for typing, I would highly recommend buying a keyboard accessory with this new iPad, or any iPad, really.

That said, I don't know how often I'm going to be using the Apple Pencil. Unless I feel like drawing something, I don't know the next time I'm actually going to need the Pencil, and that makes me feel bad since it costs over $100.

Multitasking gestures have existed since iOS 11, but I've never really had much of a reason to try them, since I never really considered using my iPad like a real work computer before.

Not having a more precise input tool to do normal computer things like select text, for instance, is already getting on my nerves. Even for this story, where I'm bolding the first sentence of each paragraph, highlighting groups of text was so finicky that I ended up manually selecting the text by pressing shift and the arrow key until I highlighted the full sentence. Fingers are rarely as precise as a mouse or keyboard, and all of those hand gestures get awfully tiresome when you're trying to do work.

Having to put a brand-new iPad Pro down to do real computer things is not good! Looking at the new iPad Pro and my 4-year-old iPad Air side by side, I'm surprised how well the iPad Air has held up. Both devices are roughly the same thickness, and the iPad Pro's display is only slightly larger than the iPad Air, even though the newer device doesn't have a home button holding it back. I love the iPad Pro, but looking at it next to a semi-old iPad Air, the differences don't feel quite so radical. It makes me wish Apple took some more risks to make the redesign stand out, like adding support for special accessories (again, mouse and trackpads, please), or making the display reach further into the corners of the screen. It's easily the best iPad yet, but it's not a revolution.

If you don't have insurance, the damage is even worse. In either case, you feel like you have no choice but to pay for expensive prescriptions, or face the repercussions on your health.\n\nIt's a dilemma that millions have to face, but shouldn't.

Blink Health works with pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers and pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring you lower prices on over 15,000 medications.\n\nThere are no membership fees or hidden fees, and the process is pretty simple. As long as you have a prescription from your doctor, you can use Blink Health's website or app.\n\nYou start by searching for your medication, making sure to match the medication form and dosage to that of your prescription. You'll see two prices, one that's available at major pharmacies and an even lower one available at one specific pharmacy near you.\n\nBlink Health\n\nHere's an example of how much Blink Health saves you on some common medications. It also has a price match guarantee on generic medications. If you find a lower price elsewhere, it will refund you the difference.\n\nBlink Health\n\nAfter paying online to lock in the price, you receive a \"Blink Card,\" which you can either print out or show on your phone to the pharmacist.

The jet is the latest in Boeing's long line of hot-selling 737 family of narrow-body airliners. The 737 MAX has earned praise for its advanced aerodynamics and fuel-efficient engines.\n\nIn fact, the 737 remains the best-selling airliner of all time, while the new MAX variant quickly became quickest selling plane in Boeing history. Through September, Boeing has sold 14,985 737s since the 1960s with 4,783 of them the MAX variant. In total, 219 737 MAX aircraft have been delivered to airlines and leasing companies.\n\nIn October, the tragic crash of Lion Air Flight JT610 brought the jet back to the forefront the public consciousness.

But investors found the results disappointing nonetheless, sending Roku's stock down 12% in after-hours exchanges on Wednesday.\n\nPotentially feeding shareholder worries, Roku projected that its bottom line in the holiday quarter won't be as robust as analysts were hoping, and it revealed that the growth rate of its platform business, which includes its fast-growing advertising sales, slowed considerably in the third quarter.\n\n\"We had a great quarter,\" CEO Anthony Wood insisted in an interview with Business Insider. \"We're very happy with how things are going.\"\n\nInvestors weren't, though. In recent after-hours trading, Roku's shares were down $7.45, or 12.66%, to $51.41. Earlier in the session, they were off as much as 13%.\n\nAnthony Wood had much to crow about\n\nFrom one vantage point, he and his colleagues had plenty of reason to be pleased with results. Roku posted $173.4 million in sales in the period, up 39% from the third quarter last year and above Wall Street's forecast of $170.4 million in revenue.\n\nFor the period, the company posted a loss of $9.5 million, or $0.09 a share. In the same period a year earlier, it lost $46.2 million, or $8.79 a share, although that figure was swelled by a one-time stock-related charge. Regardless, its results in the third quarter bested analysts' estimates; they were expecting a loss of $0.12 a share.\n\nAnd the core parts of Roku's business continued to post healthy growth. The company now has 23.8 million active customer accounts, which was up 43% from the year-ago quarter and up 8% from the second quarter this year. Its platform revenue, which includes advertising sales and the money it makes from licensing its software to television makers, grew 74% from last year's third quarter, and its revenue from video ads grew by more than 100%.\n\n\"Our ad business is firing on all cylinders,\" Wood said.\n\nBut looked at another way, the company gave investors and analysts reason for concern. Take its outlook: The company expects its bottom line in the fourth quarter to be anywhere from a loss of $4 million to a profit of $3 million on sales ranging from $255 million to $265 million. That forecast implies a bottom line ranging from a loss of about $0.04 a share to a profit of about $0.03 a share.\n\nAnalysts had forecast better results, at least on the bottom line. Prior to the report, they had projected that Roku would earn $0.05 a share in the holiday quarter on sales of $258.9 million.\n\nRoku's growth rates are slowing\n\nMeanwhile, even the company's standout results for the third quarter included some data points that likely raised eyebrows. While impressive, the company's platform growth rate slowed markedly in the quarter and has been on a consistent downward trend. In the second quarter, that segment grew at a 96% annual rate. In the three prior quarters, it grew by more than 100%.\n\nSimilarly, the growth in the company's number of active accounts also slowed down, although not as dramatically. The 43% growth accounts was the slowest pace since Roku became a public company last year.\n\nMeanwhile, its costs jumped significantly in the period. Its operating expenses were up 57% to $90.7 million, far outpacing its revenue growth.\n\nRoku faces growing competition from Amazon, which not only sells rival streaming-media boxes but also reportedly has an ad-supported streaming-video channel in the works that would rival the Roku Channel. Like Roku, Amazon has started to license the operating system that underlies its media boxes to smart-TV makers, signing a deal this summer with Best Buy to have it included on Best Buy's Insignia television line.\n\nRead more: Amazon's got its eyes set on yet another market \u2014 and one high-flying upstart should be worried\n\nThe company also potentially faces new rivals such as Comcast, which has its own streaming-media box in the works for its broadband customers, according to CNBC.\n\nWood sees advertisers as a bigger challenge than Amazon\n\nBut Wood said the bigger challenge for Roku is convincing advertisers to spend their dollars with it. The portion of advertisers' video-ad budgets that's going to Roku trails the amount of time that consumers are spending on its platform, he said.\n\n\"That's a way bigger issue than our competition,\" he said.\n\nAnd Wood isn't worried about Amazon's deal with Best Buy. That's an exclusive relationship; those TVs can't be sold outside of Best Buy, he said. By contrast, smart TVs running Roku's operating system can be sold anywhere. On top of that, the company expects Best Buy itself to carry more Roku TVs this holiday season than it did a year ago.\n\n\"Our smart-TV business is going great,\" he said. \"We're super happy with that program.\"\n\nRoku's shares closed regular trading on Wednesday up $3.24, or 5.8%, at $58.86.\n\nNow read:", "If there is one thing that has made Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stand out during the first two years of President Donald Trump's term, it's been the rapid pace at which the chamber has confirmed judges.\n\nAnd after Tuesday night's midterm elections, it's clear that McConnell is going to get the opportunity to exercise that talent for at least another two years.\n\nIn the first two years of Trump's presidency, McConnell has been able to confirm a record number of judges. The number of circuit court judges confirmed under Trump are the most at this point in a presidency in nearly 40 years \u2014 and the 84 Trump-appointed judges confirmed across all courts is the most in one Senate dating back to President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\"You know what my top priority is, I have made it very clear, it's the judiciary,\" McConnell said. \"The two Supreme Court appointments, the 29 circuit judges, the 84 overall number of judges, and we're not through doing those this year.\"\n\nThe slew of judicial appointments were aided by McConnell's historic obstruction of President Barack Obama's judicial nominees from 2014 to 2016. By keeping all of those seats open, the Kentucky Republican has allowed Trump to already leave a major impact on America's court system.\n\n\"Nearly one out of every six circuit court judges has been appointed by Trump and confirmed by the GOP Senate since 2017,\" said Chris Kreuger, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research Group. \"Another ~100 federal judges will now be confirmed via the GOP Senate over the next two years. The courts are the final arbiter of law and policy and they are being remade in Trump's image.\"\n\nThe slew of judges appointed by Trump and confirmed by McConnell is likely to be the longest lasting change of the president's first four years, even Democratic Sen. Chris Coons told Business Insider last year that the judiciary overhaul will be \"the single most important legacy of the Trump administration.\"\n\nWith the GOP picking up at least two and as many as four seats in the Senate on Tuesday, the pathway to more judicial confirmations may even become easier, as Republicans' razor-thin margin in the Senate over the past year gave moderate GOP members and Democrats the ability to block certain nominees.\n\n\"You now have the ability to push through many more of your nominees without some of the consternation on the Republican side,\" Marc Short, the former White House director of legislative affairs, told Politico.\n\nRead more: Republicans projected to hold on to majority control of the Senate\u00bb\n\nThese Trump judges are likely to shape the political landscape for decades to come and help to preserve conservative policy gains around the country, since appointments on the country's highest courts are for life.\n\nThe focus on judges is also more likely given the Democrats victory in the House.

The gesture attracted the wrath of Bonucci, and other Juventus players.\n\nWatch the United manager's reaction below:\n\n\"Beautiful Italians insulted me for 90 minutes and then I didn't insult them, I just made a little thing,\" Mourinho told the live BT Sport broadcast.\n\n\"I respect Juventus, their players, their manager, everything, the quality they have.

Since the first quarter of 2017, traditional-TV losses and the transition to digital bundles have seemed to move in tandem. The latter helped to offset the former.\n\nBut in the third quarter of 2018, the rise in vMVPDs could not keep pace with traditional-TV cord-cutting, and total subscribers fell, according to Wall Street analyst firm MoffettNathanson.\n\nMoffettNathanson\n\nIn fact, it was the first time that legacy-cable and satellite companies lost more than 1 million subscribers, analyst Rich Greenfield said on Twitter. Including vMVPD subscribers, that loss was mitigated to about 500,000, the worst loss in two years.\n\n\"People just aren't seeing the value,\" Alan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst for TVREV, told Business Insider.\"Right now there's a loss of 0.7%, but we will start seeing much bigger losses, especially as 'the flix' \u2014 Disneyflix, Appleflix, Warnerflix \u2014 come to market.\" Disney, Apple, and AT&T's WarnerMedia have all announced over-the-top streaming services that will be released in the future.\n\nBoth Sling, which is owned by Dish, and DirecTV, which is owned by AT&T, had poor quarters for pay-TV subs, Wolk said. Sling had carrier disputes over the quarter, but, overall, part of the churn is related to other vMVPDs like YouTube TV and Hulu stealing subscribers, analysts at Barclays said.\n\nWhile traditional pay TV will take the biggest hits to subscriber losses in the future, Wolk said he expects the trend of weakened growth, or even losses, to cable- and satellite-provided over-the-top services to continue. One potential area for hope may be for these companies to lean back into the original skinny bundle, Wolk said, pointing to bloated packages that offer 80 channels.\n\nNBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke also recently tempered expectations about the streaming market. \"The growth of the virtual MVPDs is starting to plateau, at least in the last month,\" he said on Comcast's analysts call in October.\n\nBut Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, said he's cautious about drawing conclusions from one quarter about the viability of digital-TV bundles like Sling and DirecTV Now.\n\n\"You can only draw so much of a conclusion, because it's a new mode of monetizing TV. These are quarterly ups and downs,\" Verna told Business Insider. \"The lumpiness is coming from the fact that the services are new.

Trump has been consistently criticizing Jeff Sessions on Twitter. He's been arguably the most effective member of Trump's cabinet, but Trump says he's weak for recusing himself in the Russia probe. He criticized him for not looking into Clinton's email probe and says he's not tough enough of government leaks.\n\nDonald Trump: I want the attorney general to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies, which are leaking like rarely have they leaked before at a very important level. These are intelligence agencies, we cannot have that happen. You know many of my views in addition to that, but I think that's one of the very important things that they have to get on with. I've told you before I'm very disappointed by the attorney general, but we will see what happens. Time will tell.\n\n[TEXT] Trump won't say if he will fire Sessions, but some Republicans aren't having it.\n\nGraham: The chairman of the Judiciary Committee sent a pretty chilling tweet yesterday. There will be no confirmation hearing for a new attorney general in 2017. If Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay. Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency, unless Mueller did something wrong. Right now I have no reason to believe that Mueller is compromised.

Often, small businesses don't have the bandwidth to quickly load this data, or they don't have the expertise to do it, as it can be a complicated task and may require the help of data integration specialists.\n\n\"We're a world right now where every company is trying to figure out how they can unlock the power of their data,\" Tuchen said. \"Until they solve those types of problems, they can't unlock the power of their data.\"\n\nEssentially, Stitch aims to provide a simple, point-and-click tool that lets any of its users easily move data to cloud warehouses. Under Talend, Stitch will be rebranded as the Stitch Data Loader.\n\nThe origins of Stitch go back to another company called RJMetrics, which sold itself to ecommerce company Magento in 2016. At the time that acquisition was announced, RJMetrics announced that it would rebrand its Pipeline tool as Stitch and spin it out as its own company. Earlier this year, Adobe bought Magento for $1.7 billion.\n\nRead more:Big data tech company Talend sees its stock soar over 50% for its IPO\n\nThis acquisition will give Talend leverage in the cloud wars and make it a stronger partner to data warehouses like AWS, Azure, Google, and Snowflake, the two companies say.\n\n\"Talend is an ideal fit for Stitch.

Shortly before he was hired as Sessions' chief of staff last year, Whitaker wrote in an op-ed article for CNN that Mueller had \"come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\"\n\nWhitaker added that his concerns stemmed from reports that the special counsel was investigating the Trump Organization's financial records. Mueller's scrutiny of Trump's finances \"falls completely outside of the realm\" of his appointment, Whitaker wrote.\n\nBut in a letter outlining the scope of Mueller's appointment last year, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein gave Mueller broad authority to not only investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated\" with Trump's campaign, but examine \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\n\nRosenstein also gave Mueller the power to investigate \"any other matters within the scope\" of the law outlining a special counsel's jurisdiction, including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\n\nSessions' ouster on Wednesday sparked widespread concern from lawmakers and national-security experts who described it as an attempt to gut Mueller's investigation.\n\n\"Given his previous comments advocating defunding and imposing limitations on the Mueller investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from its oversight for the duration of his time as acting attorney general,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.\n\nHouse Democrats, who will have a majority in the chamber following Tuesday's midterm elections, also sounded the alarm.\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a tweet that Americans \"must have answers immediately as to the reasoning behind\" Trump's decision to remove Sessions.\n\n\"Why is the President making this change and who has authority over Special Counsel Mueller's investigation?\" Nadler added. \"We will be holding people accountable.\"\n\nJeffrey Cramer, a longtime former federal prosecutor who spent 12 years at the Justice Department, told INSIDER in a text that it was \"safe to say this news wasn't shocking to Mueller.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the timing, but everyone knew Sessions' tenure was limited,\" Cramer added. \"We should see grand jury action or a report soon.

But it's naive to think the new Democratic House of Representatives just sits there and watches.\"", "Amazon has decided on two locations for its second headquarters: Long Island City, Queens, and the National Landing area of Arlington, Virginia.\n\nInitially, Amazon made it seem like it would crown only one winner in the HQ2 competition. That would have brought 50,000 new jobs and add $50 billion to a city's economy. Instead, these jobs and funds will now be divided between two locations.\n\nA $25 billion economic stimulus and 25,000 more workers could do wonders for Long Island City \u2014 an area that has only recently begun to attract a growing population.\n\nBut New Yorkers are far from ecstatic about the decision. Locals in Long Island City worry about overcrowding in schools and sewage lines that are backing up. Across the city, residents fear that additional commuters could put pressure on an already fragile subway system.\n\nBefore word surfaced about Amazon's choice, New York City had created a plan for its deteriorating subway.\n\nIn May, the Metropolitan Transit Authority revealed a $37 billion strategy to install a new signal system across multiple lines, add thousands of new subway cars, and renovate old cars. The plan also included an updated fare method and hundreds of new elevators at subway stations.\n\nThere was just one question: Who would fund it?\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed it was the state's responsibility. A spokesperson for Gov. Andrew Cuomo told the New York Times the plan was \"dead on arrival\" without the city's investment.\n\nNow residents are asking: Could Amazon be the one to pay?\n\nNew Yorkers are freaking out\n\nAfter The New York Times broke the news that Amazon was likely moving to Queens, New Yorkers took to Twitter to share their fears about the subway's future. People are especially concerned about the 7 line, which is the most direct route from Long Island City to Midtown Manhattan. Commuters say the line is already crowded and delayed, with riders experiencing long waits on the platform.\n\nAccording to Danny Pearlstein, the policy and communications director at Riders Alliance, a transportation advocacy group, these delays may be the result of \"growing pains\" related to a new system.\n\nWhile other subway lines have been around for decades, the 7 line's mile-long extension is less than four years old. It's also undergoing a signal renovation, which Pearlstein said was on the verge of being finished. New signals would allow trains to run closer together, cutting back on delays.\n\nBut the addition of 25,000 new Amazon employees might challenge the subway's reliability.\n\n\"The overarching question is whether the city can absorb a large influx of jobs when its transit system is falling apart,\" Pearlstein said. \"There may be capacity, but if there's no reliability because the signals don't work and the cars are too old, then it doesn't matter what the capacity is.\"\n\nIf the subway does end up dealing with the apocalyptic conditions that residents have predicted, it will be because of the government's failure to fund the renovations \u2014 not Amazon's.\n\n\"The sweet spot of this [HQ2] proposal is that, if folks are coming to Long Island City from Manhattan, they're going against rush hour traffic on the subway,\" said Pearlstein. He also noted that many Amazon employees might choose to live in Brooklyn and commute on the G train, which has significant capacity. Given how many people are now choosing to live in Long Island City, some may even be able to walk to work.\n\nDon't count on Amazon\n\nEven if HQ2 does lead to more overcrowding and delays on the subway, it's unlikely that Amazon will help finance the MTA's multi-billion-dollar overhaul strategy.\n\n\"Traditionally, individual New York firms have not made direct investments in the transit system,\" Pearlstein said.\n\nWhile many subway lines were originally built by private companies, the city took over these lines in 1940, before ceding control to the state in 1968. Since then, transit improvements in New York City have been funded by state taxes, riders' fares, tolls on bridges and tunnels, and debt accrued by the MTA.\n\nIt's unlikely that Amazon would suddenly step in and revitalize a broken system \u2014 especially when the city and state have gone to such great lengths to woo the company in the first place. Two weeks ago, the city released a spending plan that raises the possibility of building a new rail station in Sunnyside Yard, two miles outside of Long Island City. The new station could benefit Amazon employees, but would tack on even more to the city's transit expenditures.\n\nTo its credit, Amazon hasn't shied away from transit investments in the past.\n\nAs the company expanded its workforce in Seattle (where the first HQ is located) to more than 45,000 employees, commute times for locals have grown longer. Last year, The Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein reported that Seattle was adding 60 people daily to its population \u2014 the most rapid increase the city has seen since the Gold Rush. Seattle now has around 61,000 \"super commuters,\" or people who spend at least 90 minutes traveling to work each day.\n\nTo address these issues, Amazon purchased a $5.5 million streetcar that would serve its Seattle campus and made a $1.5 million contribution to add more trips to the city's transit system. In 2016, the company also gave $110,000 to a ballot measure that will add more stations and light rail options by 2041.\n\nIn its solicitation for HQ2 proposals, the company said it contributed $43 million to Seattle's transportation industry from 2010 to 2017 in the form of employee benefits.\n\nRead more: Here's what New York promised Amazon to win it over\n\nBut these types of investments fall far short of the $37 billion required to ease pressure in New York City. With the city expected to become more congested, that number could climb even higher.\n\nWhile Amazon may not destroy the subway in the way that some New Yorkers anticipate, it's not poised to save the system, either.", "LONDON \u2014 Theresa May should call a second Brexit referendum to avoid the potential \"catastrophe\" of a no-deal Brexit, the former head of the UK civil service has told Business Insider.\n\nLord Kerslake, who led the civil service between 2012 and 2014 and now advises Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, told BI that the UK should be offered a two-choice referendum which includes the option to remain.\n\n\"I've changed my view and now back a second referendum,\" he told BI.\n\nHe explained that \"a combination of poor negotiations and poor choices have left us in an unenviable place, and that's why we've got to re-open this question, even at this late stage.\"\n\nKerslake added that \"no one could have imagined\" the public would be facing the \"stark choice between a poor deal or the catastrophe of no deal.\"\n\n\"Had the negotiating process gone better, we wouldn't be having this debate. It's possible the government will get a deal and be able to secure support for it in parliament, but that's looking pretty difficult to achieve now, as some very intractable issues like the Irish border have not been resolved.\"\n\nDowning Street has repeatedly ruled out the prospect of a second referendum, with Theresa May suggesting it would be a \"gross betrayal of our democracy.\"\n\nBut anti-Brexit campaigners who support a so-called \"People's Vote\" believe that the prime minister could be forced to legislate for such a scenario if MPs reject her deal in parliament.\n\nKerslake said the government should consider seeking an extension of Article 50 \u2014 the two-year EU exit process which will see the UK leave the EU in March next year \u2014 by several months to provide time for a second referendum.\n\n\"Pushing back the exit date is something that must now seriously be considered,\" he said. \"If the government is unable to produce a deal and secure the vote in parliament, we are definitely into extension territory.\"\n\nIn another development, senior EU sources have also told Business Insider that they now believe the prospect of a second Brexit referendum is becoming increasingly likely.\n\n\"We were initially sceptical of [the possibility of a referendum] but it's looking much more likely than ever before,\" an EU Commission source told BI.\n\n\"If the meaningful vote fails in parliament then we believe the option of a second vote could come into play.\"\n\nNo-deal would be a 'catastrophe'\n\nA \"People's Vote\" march Alex McBride / Getty\n\nKerslake told BI that May's government should remove the option of a \"no-deal\" scenario from the ballot paper, and offer voters a simple choice between remaining in the EU and accepting the terms of Theresa May's Brexit deal.\n\nHe said that a no-deal Brexit was \"not tenable\" because it would wreak havoc on the economy and because the civil service was unable to prepare for such a radical change in policy at short notice.\n\n\"Pursuing a no-deal Brexit, or even contemplating it when you know the damage it could do to ordinary people is frankly irresponsible,\" he said.\n\n\"We shouldn't really consider it as an option, because its consequences are so enormous,\" he said. \"The economic shock would be very significant.\"\n\nHe branded trade secretary Liam Fox \"irresponsible\" for suggesting that leaving the EU would not have a significant economic impact, and criticised Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has repeatedly called for the UK to leave without a deal.\n\n\"Those people who are saying \"Let's not worry about it, let's crash out of the EU, it'll be much easier than you think,\" are people of means on the whole,\" he said.\n\n\"Jacob Rees-Mogg is not going to be proved wrong on this point. But the vast bulk of the British population are living much closer to the edge than people like that. They cannot withstand an economic shock without real consequences to them.\"\n\nPhil Wilson MP, a leading supporter of the People's Vote campaign, welcoming Lord Kerslake's comments said:\n\n\"More and more people are realising, when faced with the miserable deal on offer, that a People's Vote is the way out of the Brexit mess. The Government cannot get us a good deal and there is no majority in Westminster for any of the Brexit options and so it must be for the people to have the final say on a decision of this importance.\"", "Taco Bueno serves hearty, faux, Tex-Mex food.

I looked for an alternative and found Sinemia, a movie-ticket subscription service that, like MoviePass, isn't tied to a specific chain like AMC Stubs A-List.\n\nAnd while my experience with Sinemia has been largely positive, there's a central issue I ran into that prospective customers should be aware of before signing up \u2014 and that gave me a bit of a flashback to my MoviePass horror stories.\n\nHere come the sneaky fees\n\nIn August, Sinemia was running a monthly promotion that gave me a plan comparable to MoviePass: $9.99 for three movies a month, but without the restrictions on movies or showtimes. I was on board and signed up.\n\nI downloaded the app and poked around. The design was cluttered and confusing, but eventually I came to a section that explained there were two ways of using Sinemia: with a card and cardless.\n\nThe card option supposedly worked much the same as MoviePass, where you check into a movie and then use your Sinemia debit card to pay at the theater. This, the app said, included no extra fees besides my monthly $9.99. The second way was \"cardless.\" Using that option I could buy my ticket online in advance, but I would have to pay the online ticketing convenience fee myself ($1.50 the first time I used it).\n\nNathan McAlone / Business Insider\n\nI thought that was definitely a fair deal and began to use the cardless option while I waited for my card to arrive. But it never did. I sent an email to customer support on October 11 and never received a response. I followed up on October 29 and still heard nothing.

Whitaker, Sessions' former chief of staff at the DOJ.\n\nWhitaker, a former US attorney from the Southern District of Iowa, is viewed by many as a staunch Trump loyalist.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, White House chief of staff John Kelly once described Whitaker as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the DOJ, which is currently investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to tilt the 2016 election in his favor.\n\nWhitaker was reportedly previously being considered to replace Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a frequent target of Trump's wrath, which stems from his belief that the DOJ isn't doing enough to shield him from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is spearheading the FBI's Russia investigation. But Trump and Rosenstein are said to have soothed their differences in recent weeks after the two had a series of one-on-one meetings and phone calls.\n\nWhitaker, meanwhile, reportedly visits the Oval Office frequently. In September, amid speculation that Trump would oust Rosenstein, the president called Whitaker himself to assure him that he had faith in him, according to The Times.\n\nAt the heart of Trump's frustration with Sessions was the former attorney general's decision last year to recuse himself from the ongoing Russia investigation after it surfaced that he had misled the Senate about his Russia contacts during his confirmation hearings.\n\nTrump \u2014 who once reportedly mused about why \"my guys\" at the \"Trump Justice Department\" weren't protecting him \u2014 has repeatedly said that if he had known Sessions would step back from the investigation, he would have tapped someone else to be attorney general.\n\nWith Whitaker as acting attorney general until Trump nominates a replacement, the president appears to have focused on picking someone he believes will exercise more influence over Mueller and the Russia probe.\n\nTo be sure, Whitaker wrote in a CNN op-ed shortly before he was hired as Sessions' chief of staff that \"Mueller has come up to a red line in the Russia 2016 election-meddling investigation that he is dangerously close to crossing.\"\n\nWhitaker added that his concerns stemmed from reports that the special counsel was probing the Trump Organization's financial records.\n\n\"It does not take a lawyer or even a former federal prosecutor like myself to conclude that investigating Donald Trump's finances or his family's finances falls completely outside of the realm of his 2016 campaign and allegations that the campaign coordinated with the Russian government or anyone else,\" Whitaker wrote. \"That goes beyond the scope of the appointment of the special counsel.\"", "Goldman Sachs named its new partner class on Wednesday.

Some of the most wonky included, \"How much should you charge to wash all the windows in Seattle?\" or \"Why are manhole covers round?\" The idea was to test for the ability to think on your feet and come up with creative solutions, rather than relying on book learning and credentials.\n\nRead more: Google used to ask these interview questions, but they're so tricky they were eventually banned\n\nIndeed, Schmidt went on to explain that in the early days, the company hired candidates based on the school they attended and their GPAs, rather than actual, real-world experience.\n\n\"This caused all sorts of consternation... It produced people that were aggressive and ignorant of what they were doing, so they didn't know what they were doing, but they could make mistakes.\"\n\nMaking mistakes, Schmidt said, was vital for a company that was venturing into a field that had never been explored before.\n\nHe also explained that early on, the company hired way too many managers and eventually, had to let most of them go. Schmidt referred to this time as the \"Disorg.\"\n\nThe young company swung in the opposite direction after the \"Disorg,\" he said, eventually settling on a ratio of one manager to every 120 engineers.\n\n\"Larry and Sergei said, 'Well, there's no problem here. That means the managers cannot interfere with the engineers' work,\" Schmidt remembers. \"That's kind of the engineering model of the time.\"\n\nThere's some evidence that Google eventually found a happy medium: As of 2011, at least, Google managers seemed to have somewhere between 7 and 10 direct reports, according to a post on Quora.\n\nOf note: Schmidt was not asked about, and did not address, allegations against him of improper workplace behavior brought to light by a recent report in the New York Times.", "This is a preview of a research report from Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service.

Globally, more than 2.8 billion people \u2014 or 37% of the world's population \u2014 use social media, but the way those users interact with each other, and the platforms they adopt, vary widely.\n\nIn the US market, gender, income, and education level have little impact on whether an individual has adopted social networking as an activity. Age does remain a factor \u2014 younger internet users tend to be more likely to engage in social networking overall, and adopt specific social platforms.\n\nWhile social platforms offer tools that let marketers target particular audience segments, advertisers must track how these audience bases \u2014 and their behaviors \u2014 are shifting. Nearly 70% of US adults use at least one social media site, according to Pew Research Center, up from 60% in 2013 and 50% in 2010.\n\nIn a new report, Business Insider Intelligence highlights the key audience demographics for six major social platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest. It examines multiple dimensions of change within each platform's demographic makeup \u2014 including age, income, education, gender, and overall adoption in terms of online adults in the US \u2014 and assesses how certain segments of the US population have adapted their social media behaviors. The report also explores how much time each age demographic is investing on each platform.\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report:\n\nUS Facebook users aged 45-54 are spending more time on Facebook, and represent 21% of the total time spent on the platform, more than any other age group.\n\nThe age composition of Snapchat users in the US has become more evenly distributed over the past year, and it appears the company is doing a better job of attracting older users.\n\nTeens are starting to use a category of social media called \"digital hangouts.\" These are apps that enable users to video chat with several friends simultaneously. Over 60% of users on Houseparty, one of the most popular digital hangout apps, are under 24 years old.\n\nLinkedIn is popular among high-income users. Forty-five percent of US adult internet users with an income higher than $75,000 annually are on LinkedIn, making it more popular among this demographic than Instagram (31%), Pinterest (35%), or Twitter (30%).", "Thirty years after the last Playboy Club closed down, the Playboy Bunnies can once again be found serving drinks in their iconic one-piece costumes complete with bow ties, bunny ears, and high heels.\n\nThe new Playboy Club opened in New York City amid mixed reviews, with some calling the club \"tone deaf\" for opening in the era of #MeToo.\n\nThe club's creative and marketing directors, however, see it as a welcome revival of the brand. Richie Notar, the creative director of the club who is an alum of Nobu and Studio 54, and Nicole Levinson, who handles marketing and communications for the brand, say the club has always been ahead of its time and defend it as inherently empowering for women.\n\n\"We're really just taking a brand that had a bit of a memory, an iconic brand, and reviving for a latter day,\" Notar said. \"Everyone has some connotation of what Playboy was. Somebody had their dad's Playboy in their room \u2014 women wanted to be bunnies.\"\n\nNotar said it's the people who make a club special \u2014 and he said he hoped this club would see a variety of interesting personalities. \"We want 25-year-old up-and-coming artists to come here and sit next to a tech icon,\" he said.\n\nThe bar area of the club is open to the public, but memberships for exclusive access and perks start at $5,000 a year and go up to $100,000. Those who buy a top-tier membership will get perks that include chauffeur services to and from the club, 10 complimentary nights at a local boutique hotel, 10 VIP sports tickets a year in the Playboy seats for either Giants, Jets, Knicks, or Rangers games or the US Open, and a VIP table with bottle service at all Playboy events.

Department of Justice\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Sessions' handling of the Justice Department, particularly related to the investigation into Russia's election interference. Trump has long made it clear he did not agree with Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the investigation, berating him in an at times brutal public fashion.\n\nLegal experts suggested on Wednesday that though Trump might have fired Sessions to exercise more control over the Russia investigation, the attorney general's ouster may have added yet another piece to a growing obstruction-of-justice case against Trump.\n\nIn addition to criticizing Sessions' recusal, Trump has also said that had he known Sessions would step back from overseeing the investigation, he would have picked someone else as attorney general.\n\nMoreover, The New York Times reported earlier this year that Trump once ordered the White House counsel Don McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing himself, and that when McGahn was unsuccessful, Trump erupted in anger, saying he needed Sessions to \"protect\" and \"safeguard\" him. The news added another layer to reports that the president once speculated about why \"my guys\" at the \"Trump Justice Department\" weren't doing more to shield him from Mueller's scrutiny.\n\nAfter the special counsel was appointed in May 2017, Trump also channeled his fury toward Sessions, accusing him of \"disloyalty.\"\n\nSessions' departure came one day after the 2018 midterm elections, which saw Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives.

Beto O'Rourke, and gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Andrew Gillum in Florida came up short.\n\nWhile O'Rourke and Gillum came within points of their opponents but ultimately lost, Abrams may proceed to a runoff next month with Republican Brian Kemp if neither candidate breaks 50 percent of the vote.\n\nThe three candidates captured the national imagination on the left in part because they ran in purple and red states that Trump won in 2016, and in part because of their clear vision for the Democratic party's leftward trajectory. All three faced Republican opponents who fully embraced President Donald Trump's agenda and rhetoric.\n\nGillum would have become the first black governor of the Sunshine State, while Abrams would have become the country's first black female governor.\n\nAll three ran grassroots-powered campaigns fueled in part by the anti-Trump resistance and in part by a rejection of the Democratic establishment, with policy positions on key issues like healthcare and immigration that were to the left of the party mainstream.\n\nO'Rourke attracted perhaps the most attention of any Democrat running this cycle, raising more money than any Senate candidate in US history and becoming a social media sensation as video clips of his town halls and road trips across the state went viral.\n\nDespite coming up short in these key races, some Democrats say the fact that they were all competitive in the first place is a win for the party and a testament to the strength of the candidates.\n\n\"Part of the reason Abrams, O'Rourke, and Gillum got a lot of national attention is that they're all trying to do something very hard in their respective states in a novel way. But the fundamentals are powerful!\" tweeted liberal MSNBC host Chris Hayes.\n\nOthers on the left argued that the odds in all three southern states were unfairly stacked against Democrats as voters were purged from the polls in Georgia at unprecedented levels and more than 1.5 million ex-felons were prevented from voting in Florida.\n\n\"This speaks to the mountains progressives have to move to win elections in our racist semi-democracy,\" Sean McElwee, a progressive activist and pollster, told Business Insider. \"Run the election again in a world where you don't have to be deputized to register people in Texas, where Brian Kemp doesn't pick his own electorate, and where the victims of mass incarceration have a voice in our elections [and] you get a different result.

Nasukawa is 27-0 and considered one of the most talented kickboxers and fighters in Japan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mayweather wrote that he was under the impression that the fight was meant to be an entertaining exhibition in front of a \"small group of wealthy spectators,\" not an official fight.\n\n\"Ultimately, I was asked to participate in a 9 minute exhibition of 3 rounds with an opponent selected by the 'Rizen Fighting Federation [sic],'\" Mayweather's Instagram read.\n\n\"What I was originally informed of by Brent Johnson of 'One Entertainment' was that this was to be an exhibition put on for a small group of wealthy spectators for a very large fee.

Yahoo's Kevin Iole wrote that it was unclear if it would be an actual fight or something scripted like pro-wrestling.\n\nSome even wondered if it was just a promotion to drum up interest in Rizin.\n\nIt would have gone against Mayweather's track record to step out of his comfort zone to take on a fighter, even for a large sum of money. When Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao in 2015, he was accused of waiting until Pacquiao was on the decline of his fighting career, rather than when Pacquiao was closer to Mayweather's equal.

But Fox, the studio behind the movie, is also pushing director Bryan Singer, despite firing him before the movie was finished.\n\nFox's \"For Your Consideration\" Oscar-campaign website lists Bryan Singer for Best Director among the categories it's hoping for \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" to be nominated in. The movie's best shot at a nomination in any of the major categories is Malek, as the film has received backlash for its historical inaccuracies and portrayal of Mercury's legacy, on top of subpar reviews (it has a 60% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes).\n\nFox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFox\n\nThe movie came to theaters this month after a troubled production, in which Singer was regularly absent from set to the point where Fox had to replace him with Dexter Fletcher late into filming.\n\nHowever, Singer was still credited as the sole director of the movie. Director's Guild of America rules stipulate that a movie must have one director or director-team credit, and Fletcher said that he did not want to be credited.\n\nOn top of the controversy surrounding the film, Singer is also facing a lawsuit that claims he sexually assaulted a 17 year old at a party in 2003. He has denied it.

A company called Spaceflight Industries organized the mission, and it claims this is the largest-ever rideshare mission in US history, as spacecraft from 35 different companies and organizations will fly aboard the rocket.\n\nRead more: Elon Musk and SpaceX are building a monster rocket for Mars. Here's how big it is compared to 20 familiar objects.\n\nHowever, three microwave-oven-sized spacecraft on the mission \u2014 a cluster called Pathfinder \u2014 are particularly worth noting.\n\nAn illustration of the SSO-A payload deploying CubeSats and microsatellites. Spaceflight Industries The trio of spacecraft belong to a startup called HawkEye 360, and they're designed to \"see\" radio signals from space. The company's software will take unique radio signals coming from ships to \"fingerprint\" vessels, track them over time, and even forecast future movements.\n\nIf Pathfinder works, authorities around the world could gain a major leg up in hunting \"dark ships\": vessels that turn off GPS location transponders, often to hide their whereabouts and engage in illicit activity.\n\nSuch activity includes illegal fishing, smuggling, drug trafficking, and piracy, and it amounts to roughly $3 trillion each year, says John Serafini, the CEO of HawkEye 360.\n\n\"We care about the folks that are not doing the right thing. We care about the vessels that don't want to be found,\" Serafini told Business Insider. \"We're focused on detecting those and stopping them.\"\n\nHunting 'dark ships' with radio waves\n\nA HawkEye 360 data visualization that shows every instance over a month in which a boat turned off its automatic identification system (AIS) for more than 8 hours. HawkEye 360\n\nHawkEye 360 claims it's unique not only for its radio-signal-detecting technology, but also artificial-intelligence-powered software the startup has developed to process data.\n\n\"You couldn't have started this company 10 years ago,\" Serafini said. \"The costs were too high, and the technology wasn't there.\"\n\nHe added that HawkEye 360 exists today because of the increasing miniaturization of electronics, SpaceX's lower-cost rocket launches, and advancements in machine learning.\n\nPathfinder, like the other satellites SpaceX is launching, will sweep around Earth from pole-to-pole in what's called a sun-synchronous orbit \u2014 hence the \"SSO\" in the mission's name. (The \"A\" signifies that it's the first of multiple rideshare missions.) This orbit keeps sunlight drenching a spacecraft's solar panels while allowing it to fly over every square inch of the planet.\n\nThe antennas of Pathfinder can detect a wide range of radio signals above about 1 watt in power. (\"Cell phones are well below a watt in power,\" Serafini said. \"We don't have the ability or the focus to do that.\")\n\nThis means the cluster can triangulate normally hard-to-pinpoint signals from satellite phones, push-to-talk radios, and marine radar. Ships need these and other radio-emitting tools to navigate the seas, the thinking goes.\n\nThis is especially true for \"dark ships,\" since those vessels turn off a mandatory device called an automatic identification system, or AIS. The AIS broadcasts a ship's GPS location to avoid collisions, but turning it off is a common trick vessels use if they're slipping into unapproved fishing zones or trafficking illegal drugs, wares, or people.\n\nSerafini said that may soon cease to be an effective way to avoid getting noticed.\n\n\"If you're turning on and off the AIS, we're going to track your other emitters. If you try to turn them all off, you're effectively negating your operation. You need to use them to navigate and communicate,\" Serafini said. \"If you do that, we've won. You can't be effective.\"\n\nHow Pathfinder works\n\nHawkEye 360's three microsatellites that will form its Pathfinder constellation. HawkEye 360\n\nThe Pathfinder system relies on the fact that so many brands and models of radio transponders are used by ships. Minor variations in those devices , and the frequencies they use, lead to subtle differences in radio emissions that HawkEye 360 says it can detect and exploit.\n\nMore importantly, by tracking a mix of these radio emissions on a ship and pairing those with AIS signals (when the devices are turned on), the company can \"fingerprint\" every ocean vessel on Earth. That way, even if a ship is \"spoofing\" its AIS data, the company says it will know; AIS data will report one location, but the vessel's radio fingerprint will reveal its true location.\n\nHawkEye 360 says it has already proved that its system works by equipping three Cessna jet airplanes with Pathfinder technology, flying them over the Chesapeake Bay, and detecting ships that were spoofing their AIS data.\n\n\"We were able to not only detect the AIS spoofing but also geolocate the ships using their other radio signals,\" Chris DeMay, the founder and CTO of HawkEye 360, told Business Insider. \"We were able to map where the ship actually was and compare that to where the ship said it was.\"\n\nData from HawkEye 360's airplane-based test of its core technology. Blue dots show reported locations, based on automatic identification system (AIS) data, while orange dots show radio-frequency-based locations. Red circles indicate a zone of 95% certainty. HawkEye 360/ESRI\n\nIn addition to fingerprinting such vessels, HawkEye 360's machine-learning algorithms will also be able to determine typical activity patterns for a ship and flag any unusual deviation.\n\nOver time, the company says, it could even forecast the future locations of individual vessels based on their past behavior.\n\n\"Because we'll be the first ones to do this, we'll be the first ones to bring it to the commercial market,\" Serafini said.\n\nThe future of tracking radio signals from above\n\n\"Dark ships\" will be targeted by Pathfinder. Jo Yong-Hak/REUTERS\n\nThe Pathfinder satellite cluster will give HawkEye 360 a global view of certain radio transmissions on Earth once every four to six hours. But DeMay and Serafini say that's just the beginning.\n\nAccording to them, HawkEye 360 is backed by about $30 million in funding (enough to operate for 18 months), has 31 employees, and has lined up more than $100 million in future work. In the future, they aim to launch five more three-satellite clusters, which will create a constellation that can map Earth's radio signals once every 30 to 40 minutes.\n\nLaunching larger and more capable satellites will also improve the company's ability to detect weaker signals.\n\n\"Trucks use radio emitters that we could detect and track,\" Serafini said. \"If a truck is known to have a history of illegal border crossing, we might want to track that particular object.\"\n\nThe company expects the US military to be increasingly interested in the technology, especially considering that HawkEye 360 can deploy its sensors on airplanes and high-altitude balloons (in addition to satellites). That feature could allow for real-time tracking of drones and weak signals on a battlefield.\n\nAn illustration of a cell tower transmitting data. HawkEye 360\n\nAnother planned use of Pathfinder is more down-to-earth: The technology could detect improper use of the radio-frequency spectrum, including interference between cell-phone towers. Such interference can cause data loss between mobile devices and towers, leading to slow and unreliable internet, among other problems.\n\nGround crews with trucks typically drive around towers to search for and identify such problems, but such teams and equipment can expensive to deploy, especially on a nationwide scale.\n\n\"It's like that Verizon 'Can you hear me now?' guy, but in space,\" DeMay said \u2014 and possibly a lot cheaper and more effective.\n\nThis story has been updated. It was originally published on November 7, 2018.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story stated that HawkEye 360 can uniquely identify individual radios. The company said this may be possible in the future, but noted its current technology can only distinguish between radio emissions of different models and brands.", "President Donald Trump got into a heated exchange with the CNN reporter Jim Acosta on Wednesday, prompting CNN to release an impassioned rebuke of the president.\n\n\"This President's ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far,\" the network said in a statement. \"They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American.\"\n\nCNN said Trump \"does not respect a free press\" but \"has a sworn obligation to protect it.\"\n\n\"A free press is vital to democracy, and we stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere,\" CNN added.\n\nAs Acosta attempted to ask Trump questions at Wednesday's press conference, the president refused to answer and told him to sit down.

After the report was published in August, Riot acknowledged that the company's emphasis on what it called \"gamer\" culture resulted in gendered discrimination.\n\nRead more:Riot Games apologizes after being accused of sexist culture, vows to change\n\nRepresentatives for the plaintiffs, Jessica Negron and Melanie McCracken, claim the \"core gamer\" identity emphasized by Riot is explicitly male and was used to disqualify women from recruitment and promotions. Furthermore, they allege that women have been assigned to lower-paying jobs while less qualified men receive more frequent promotions. The lawsuit also claims women in the workplace are subjected to additional criticism, harassment, and retaliation based on gender.\n\n\"Women are required to participate and tolerate crude male humor which include jokes about sex, defecation, masturbation, rape, and torture,\" the lawsuit says. \"Women who do not join in these adolescent humor jokes are classified as 'snobby' and unwilling to fit in with the company.\"\n\nThe lawsuit offers several specific examples of how what it calls Riot's \"bro culture\" negatively affected female employees.

A handful of states also voted to expand their Medicaid programs under Obamacare.\n\nDemocrats won the messaging fight on healthcare\n\nWith Democrats regaining control of the House, the GOP push to repeal and replace Obamacare is buried for the time being. If you ask Democrats, the prospect of another shot at repeal helped propel the party to victory.\n\nDemocratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, widely assumed to be the next speaker of the House, pointed directly to healthcare as the key to the party's path to the majority.\n\n\"It's about stopping the GOP and Mitch McConnell's assault on Medicare, Medicaid, affordable health care, and millions of Americans living with pre-existing medical conditions,\" Pelosi said during a victory speech, referring to the Senate majority leader.\n\nThe ACA is polling near its highest level ever. And many of the law's provisions, including protections for people with preexisting conditions, remain significantly popular. The rising popularity and the GOP's legislative attacks on Obamacare allowed Democrats to draw a stark contrast with their Republican opponents.\n\nHealthcare ranked as the top issue for voters in exit polling, and Americans generally trusted Democrats more than Republicans. According to an exit poll of 75 competitive, GOP-held districts by the left-leaning Public Policy Polling, 52% of people said they trusted Democrats more on healthcare, compared to just 44% who trusted the GOP more.\n\nThe switch represents a huge change from the 2010 and 2014 midterms, when Republicans hammered Democrats on the ACA and healthcare in general.\n\nAn outstanding question, however, is what exactly Congress could do to shore up Obamacare in a divided Congress. A bipartisan push to reinforce the law's individual insurance markets fell through in 2017, but McConnell hinted that another deal could be on the docket in 2019.\n\n\"We are going to have to try to address that on a bipartisan basis,\" McConnell said.\n\nMedicaid expansion is a winner\n\nPerhaps most significant for Obamacare's legacy is the continued popularity of the law's Medicaid expansion. The ACA allows states to expand Medicaid eligibility to people making up to 138% of the federal poverty limit, helping low-income Americans gain access to healthcare.\n\nExpansion is heavily subsidized by the federal government to ease the cost burden on states, but many state-level Republicans have rejected the idea due to budgetary concerns. But slowly, the protestations of the GOP are giving way to a gradual march of Medicaid expansion.\n\nThree deep-red states \u2014 Idaho, Nebraska, and Utah\u2014 joined the 32 expansion states via ballot initiatives on Tuesday. Solid majorities in each state voted for expansion, which will help roughly 325,000 people gain access to Medicaid.\n\nIn addition to the direct pick ups for expansion, a couple of governor's races could lead to additional gains:\n\nThe Kansas legislature passed a bill to expand Medicaid in 2017, but it was blocked by then-Gov. Sam Brownback. Pro-expansion Democrat Laura Kelly took the governor's mansion, which could allow another crack at expansion and open to door for around 150,000 more people to enroll in Medicaid.\n\nTony Evers, the Democratic governor-elect in Wisconsin, could also accept federal aid to boost the state's Medicaid program and extend coverage to another 176,000 people in the state.\n\nAdditionally, Maine Gov. Paul LePage's refusal to implement Medicaid expansion despite a 2017 vote in favor of the move will likely be broken by the new Democratic Governor-elect Janet Mills. 70,000 people in the state could be eligible for Medicaid if expansion moves forward.\n\nOther states could see expansion, like in North Carolina, where Republicans lost their supermajority in the state legislature, but that remains less likely.\n\nIn total, with the ballot initiatives and governors' races, up to 721,000 Americans could gain access to healthcare via Medicaid expansion in the wake of the midterms.", "President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused the PBS correspondent Yamiche Alcindor, who is black, of asking a \"racist question\" about whether his rhetoric emboldened white nationalists.\n\nAlcindor asked Trump whether his recent embrace of the label \"nationalist\" emboldened white nationalists across the country.\n\nIn response, Trump assailed Alcindor and touted his poll numbers among African-Americans.\n\n\"That's such a racist question \u2026 Let me tell you, it's a racist question,\" he said. \"I love our country.

Barrett, Zion Williamson, and Cam Reddish, combined for 83 points, nearly outscoring all of Kentucky by themselves.\n\nAnd though Williamson was not the top scorer, contributing 28 points to Barrett's 33, he stole the show, displaying a unique skill set and physicality that has the basketball world drooling.\n\nWilliamson is a 6-foot-7, 285-lb forward who was the No. 2 high school prospect in the country when he landed at Duke. He rose to fame as his jaw-dropping athleticism and dunks created highlights that spread around social media.\n\nAs soon as Williamson arrived at Duke, he began to excite the basketball world with his incredible leaping ability. His vertical test with the team was a highlight reel unto itself.\n\nWilliamson's athleticism and build are only part of what makes him such a unique player. His weight is closer to that of an NBA center (if not heavier), but he moves like a small forward. Williamson theoretically could defend bigger players and blow by them on offense. Put a smaller player on him, and he can bully them on offense and use his quickness to stick with them.\n\nOn Tuesday, Williamson also showed that his game has grown in significant ways. He'll never be Stephen Curry from beyond the arc, but a reliable jump shot would go a long way for him.\n\nHis handle also looked tight, and once he's on the move, his speed and athleticism take over.\n\nAnd if he's leading fastbreaks and threading the needle to teammates, forget about it.\n\nESPN's NBA draft expert Jonathan Givony said on \"The Jump\" in August that he had never seen a player as big and athletic as Williamson before while noting that he's an odd prospect in that he doesn't have many elite offensive skills other than finishing at the rim.\n\nThe most common comparison Williamson gets is Charles Barkley, perhaps because of their similar physical builds. But Williamson may already hold an athletic edge, and he may be more adept off the dribble. That's no small feat \u2014 Barkley is a Hall of Famer.\n\nBut the most intriguing part of Williamson is the numerous tools at his disposal. Though he doesn't dominate in any one area, the number of things he does well, combined with his elite physical tools, makes him a top NBA prospect already. As The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor wrote, Williamson already has the skills to be the perfect NBA big man for this era, and that's as he is only getting a taste of college basketball. If he continues to improve and produce jaw-dropping highlights, his stock should only rise.\n\n\"Somebody asked me to describe Zion Williamson in three words,\" ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas said after the game on Tuesday, \"And I'm like, 'Oh my God!'\"", "WSJ: \"If you're in search of a new Mac, the Air is the best choice.

Joe Crowley in the New York Democratic congressional primary in June, the word \"socialist\" was repeatedly used to describe her.\n\nOcasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress in US history in the 2018 midterms on November 6.\n\nShe's a registered member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and is a self-described socialist.\n\nRead more: Diversity wins: All the people who made history in the 2018 midterm elections\n\n\"Socialist\" remains a dirty, and often misunderstood, term in the realm of US politics. The Cold War, in which animosity and paranoia toward the Soviet Union was pervasive in the US, is largely to thank for that.\n\nBut what does it mean to be a socialist versus a Democratic socialist, and is there even a difference?\n\nWhat is socialism? It depends on who you're talking to.\n\nA socialist, in the traditional sense, is an adherent of socialism.\n\nSocialism can be defined as \"a system of social organization in which private property and the distribution of income are subject to social control.\"\n\nIn other words, it's a state-controlled economy in which the state controls the means of production (factories, offices, resources, and firms). There are also forms of socialism in which the means of production are controlled and owned by workers.\n\nFrom an academic standpoint, there's an ongoing debate about what socialism really is.\n\n\"The academic debates about socialism's 'meaning' are huge and arcane and rife with disagreements, but what all definitions have in common is either the elimination of the market or its strict containment,\" Frances Fox Piven, a political scientist at the City University of New York and a former DSA board member, told Vox.\n\nWhat do socialists believe in?\n\nIn general, socialists believe the government should provide a range of basic services to the public, such as health care and education, for free or at a significant discount.\n\nIn the present day, \"Democratic socialist\" and \"socialist\" are often treated as interchangeable terms, which can be confusing given Democratic socialists don't necessarily think the government should immediately take control of all aspects of the economy.\n\nThey do, however, generally believe the government should help provide for people's most basic needs and help all people have an equal chance at achieving success.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's platform, for example, calls for Medicare for all, tuition-free college, and treats housing as a right.\n\nDemocratic socialists are committed to democracy\n\nDemocratic socialists also believe strongly in democracy and democratic principles. They are by no means proponents of authoritarian government systems many Americans associate socialism with.\n\nAs the DSA's website states: \"At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end. As we are unlikely to see an immediate end to capitalism tomorrow, DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.\"\n\nTo put it another way, they don't feel socialism should be forced on people, but they are fundamentally anti-capitalist and believe the government should urge privately owned businesses toward granting workers as much control as possible.\n\nThe DSA and Democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez place a great deal of emphasis on social justice in conjunction with pushing for an economy that's largely controlled by workers.\n\nThe DSA supports reforms that would decrease the influence of money in politics, empower ordinary people in workplaces and the economy, and restructure gender and cultural relationships to be more equitable, according to its website.\n\nTo put this into context, Ocasio-Cortez's platform calls for an end to the war on drugs, the demilitarization of police departments, and the abolishment of for-profit prisons.\n\nHere's how Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-declared Democratic socialist, defined it in a 2006 interview: \"I think [democratic socialism] means the government has got to play a very important role in making sure that as a right of citizenship all of our people have healthcare; that as a right, all of our kids, regardless of income, have quality childcare, are able to go to college without going deeply into debt; that it means we do not allow large corporations and moneyed interests to destroy our environment; that we create a government in which it is not dominated by big money interest.\"\n\n\"I mean, to me, it means democracy, frankly,\" Sanders added. \"That's all it means.\"", "A first-time candidate in Texas who went into labor during a border-separation protest was elected into the state's House of Representatives.\n\nDemocrat Erin Zwiener, a 33-year-old children's book author, defeated Republican Ken Strange in Texas' District 45 House of Representatives race in Tuesday night's Midterm elections.\n\nZwiener was pregnant throughout her campaign, and according to TIME correspondent Charlotte Atler, she continued to talk with voters even after going into labor.\n\nAtler said Zwiener went into labor during a border-separations protest, but that didn't stop her from speaking about her campaign.\n\n\"She met three potential voters at the hospital,\" Atler wrote on Twitter. \"She had some time to kill after her epidural, so she wrote a fundraising email.\"\n\nRead more: Midterm key takeaways: Trump's message flops, and Democrats set the stage for 2020\n\nZwiener continued to campaign after giving birth, and one of her supporters taught her how to tie a blanket in order to nurse in public, Atler said.\n\nThe first-time candidate from Driftwood, Texas, won 51% of the votes on Tuesday night.\n\nJust over 80,000 people voted in the District 45 House election, which encompasses Blanco and Hays counties.\n\nDuring her campaign, Zwiener pushed for public education funding, investments in renewable energy and Medicaid expansion, according to KUT News.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

And now, the company says it's making progress on getting the meat to your table at an affordable price.\n\nSeveral other companies have been aiming to make a product like New Age Meats' sausage since the creation of the first burger made from cow cells in 2013. They hope to slash waste, curb pollution, and improve animal and human health.\n\nThis week at an event organized by the Silicon Valley biotech funding hub IndieBio, Brian Spears, New Age Meats' founder, revealed roughly how much the sausage now costs to make and announced progress on nailing a formula that addresses one of the \"holy grails\" of clean meat.\n\nSausage without slaughter\n\nLast month, Spears and co-founder Andra Necula served their freshly cooked pork-sausage links \u2014 which had been made using fat and muscle cells generated from a single sample of a live pig named Jessie \u2014 to 40 journalists and prospective investors.\n\nNew Age Meats' pork sausage sizzles in a pan. Katie Canales/Business Insider\n\nThe company started just three months ago with $250,000 in seed funding from IndieBio, the accelerator that also gave cultured-meat startup Memphis Meats its start.\n\n\"We really thought, 'Do we want to invest in another cultured-meat startup?'\" Arvind Gupta, IndieBio's cofounder, told Business Insider in September. \"But after we met the team and saw what they could do, we had to.\"\n\n\"This is the most product and the fastest production from any cultured-meat startup we've seen so far,\" Gupta said.\n\nAs Spears, a chemical engineer by training, and Necula, a cell biologist, watched, the sausage sizzled in a pan with a little grapeseed oil. Slowly, it began to brown on each side like conventional sausage. The room filled with the smell of breakfast meat. After a few minutes \u2014 just before the sausage casing began to blister \u2014 we dug into our bite-sized samples.\n\nIt tasted like meat. Then again, it is meat.\n\nThe texture was distinctly sausage-like. After I'd chewed my bite, I wasn't sure I would have been able to tell the difference between this pork sausage and any other. Perhaps it was a little drier, a little more crumbly? It was hard to tell from just one bite, but I was pretty sure there were no glaring differences.\n\nNew Age Meats says its pork sausage is 12x cheaper to make today than it was a month ago\n\nBrian Spears and Andra Necula co-founded New Age Meats. Courtesy of New Age Meats\n\nDespite their hard work, Spears and Necula face many obstacles on the road to producing cost-effective clean meat. The two biggest hurdles involve making enough of the product affordably and nailing the meat's recipe and texture.\n\nBack in 2013, when Dutch scientist Mark Post became the first person in the world to make a beef burger from cow cells, his patty cost $330,000 to produce.\n\nRead more: Silicon Valley VCs are betting lab-grown meat could be just as big a deal as Uber was for taxis and have 'huge disruptive abilities' to a $200 billion industry\n\nThis week, Spears said the meat was inching closer to being made at a cost of about $5 per breakfast sausage link. That's about $23 per pound \u2014 still far pricier than than any other sausage or vegetarian sausage on the market but much closer to the goal that most of these companies are looking to hit.\n\nRight now, it costs New Age Meats about $216 to make each sausage. Still, that's down from about $2,500 in September, mean the meat has become about 12 times cheaper to produce in a month.\n\nPart of the reason the meat is so expensive has to do with the food these startups are feeding their farm-free animal cells. That's another hurdle that Spears announced that his company had made progress in clearing this week.\n\nMe trying my first lab-grown sausage. Katie Canales/Business Insider\n\nMany companies still use something called fetal bovine serum (FBS), a standard and relatively inexpensive lab medium made from the blood of pregnant slaughtered cows. To live up to their goal of replacing animal slaughter, these startups will need to find something new and slaughter-free that costs the same or less.\n\nAnd while the prototype sausages that New Age Meats served at its September event were made using FBS, Spears said this week that the company planned to nail a serum-free recipe within two months.\n\nAnother issue with cell-based meat is the products' texture.\n\nMaking a sausage, patty, fish cake, or any other product that combines several ingredients with ground meat or seafood is nowhere near as difficult as mimicking the complex texture and flavor of a steak or a chicken breast. To do that, startups will likely need to take many of their cues from regenerative medicine, where scientists strive to heal or grow real human tissues and organs. Applying those tools to the world of cultured meat could result in the first farm-free products that chew, slice, and taste like a traditional steak or thigh.\n\nFor this reason, Necula said she and Spears planned to continue working in the realm of sausage-like items, but they're exploring options that include products made with beef, pork, and crab.\n\nSeveral other startups appear to be making headway on their first cultured-meat products as well.\n\nThe CEO of Just, a Silicon Valley startup formerly known as Hampton Creek, recently tweeted a photo that appeared to show a prototype of its first cultured-chicken nuggets; Memphis Meats, the Silicon Valley startup that claimed it made the first lab-grown chicken and duck products in 2017, invited me to a tasting of its products before the year's end. And New Age Meats made history with the first semi-public tasting of its sausage in September.\n\n\"How did we move so quickly?\" Spears, an engineer, asked this week. \"Because we were designed to.\"\n\nThis article is an updated version of a story that was originally published on Sept. 18, 2018.", "Inside Goldman's headquarters, where 69 people today achieved one of Wall Street's most coveted titles. Goldman Sachs\n\nEarlier today, Goldman Sachs named a new crop of partners, one of the most coveted titles on Wall Street.\n\nThis year, 69 people earned the honor, the smallest class in more than a decade. Women made up 26% of the class, the most ever.\n\nJoining this elite group comes with a nice paycheck and numerous perks. Partners usually get a salary of $950,000, access to a special bonus pool and an opportunity to invest in fee-free investment funds.\n\nMaking partner is a carryover from Goldman's history as a private partnership, which ended with its May 1999 public offering.\n\nThe process of making partner hasn't changed much over there years. You have to run a significant business or have made the firm a lot of money, according to current partners. Inside Goldman, some people even talk about their partner trade or the business platform they created.\n\nThis summer, after being crowned as Lloyd Blankfein's successor, incoming CEO David Solomon instructed his colleagues to slightly alter their approach. Solomon, who became CEO Oct. 1, told the people making the selections they should consider at least three characteristics: give preference to execs who hold revenue-producing roles, place people on the list only if they have a real shot of making the cut and ensure women execs get a fair shot at making the final list.\n\nWith those changes aside, here's everything you need to know about becoming a Goldman partner:\n\nIt happens every two years: Partners are selected every two years in an extremely secretive process. Potential candidates are identified in the summer: The firm doesn't explicitly tell the candidates. It's not a surprise, though. Candidates generally have an idea if they're being considered. Candidates are vetted through an intense process called cross-ruffing: The term cross-ruffing comes from the card game bridge. Cross-ruffing is when current partners and other Goldman employees engage in a series of lengthy conversations on whether a candidate deserves to be made partner. The candidates, however, are not interviewed, and they are blind to who is interviewing and who is being interviewed. The selection committee looks for folks who've made an impact at the firm: Employees talk about the trade that made them partner, or the business they built from scratch that generated a lot of revenue for the firm. The committee wants leaders and people who embody the firm's business principles and standards. Solomon will personally call you with the great news: Solomon calls the employee to let him or her know that he or she has made partner. As you can imagine, folks will probably be anxiously waiting by their phones. Those who didn't make the cut are told: For many who didn't make it, it can be a major disappointment. But they will also get feedback so they can work toward making partner in a future cycle. Goldman has already started telling people that they didn't make the cut. Current partners are forbidden from congratulating the new partner class right away: The current partners will find out who made the cut in the morning, too. However, they can't say \"congratulations\" until the list is released to the entire firm (usually around noon ET). The idea is that they don't want to accidentally say something before the person has received that very special phone call. Making partner is supposed to be an incredible feeling: One former partner told eFinancial News: \"Don't tell my wife this, but being made partner was the greatest moment of my life.\" Your day-to-day doesn't really change: After two or three days of congratulations, you get back to normal. While your day-to-day doesn't really change, the firm expects more of you. You'll be in partner meetings. You'll sit on committees. You'll also probably make some campus recruiting trips. Being a partner means getting a boost in your base salary: One of the biggest benefits of being a partner at Goldman is the lucrative paycheck. They get a nice chunk of the bonus pool: In addition to the base salary, a portion of the bank's bonus pool is divvied up among the 400-plus Goldman partners. There are special investment opportunities, too: Partners are given access to investment opportunities not available to other employees. The number of partners in a class isn't set: Historically, the number tends to fall between 1.5% and 1.9% of the full-time Goldman Sachs employee population. Age doesn't matter: Age isn't a parameter. Performance is what is important. However, the firm would look at the time someone has spent in a role. Vice presidents can be made partner: While the committee usually taps managing directors, there have been instances in which a VP has made it. You can go through the process more than once: If you don't make partner, it doesn't mean you won't have another shot. Timing is everything. You might make it the next cycle or the one after that.\n\nBest of luck to the new partners!\n\nSee also:\n\n-- Julia la Roche contributed to an earlier version of this story.", "Goldman Sachs has selected its latest class of partners, bestowing 69 people with one of the most sought titles on Wall Street.\n\nA record-high 26% of this year's class consisted of women. The sales-and-trading division, which has been struggling to adapt to postcrisis rule changes, got 28 new partners.

Department of Defense has downgraded the border mission for US troops, scrapping the name \"Operation Faithful Patriot\" and replaced it with \"border support.\"\n\n\"We are not calling it Operation Faithful President,\" Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Jamie Davis told Business Insider, confirming an earlier report from The Wall Street Journal. \"We are calling it border support.\"\n\nThe Pentagon refused to offer an explanation for the decision to change the name, which was first introduced by US Northern Command. \"The mission status remains unchanged,\" NORTHCOM told BI.\n\nThe operation, announced last week, has already seen more than 5,000 active-duty military personnel deployed to locations across Texas, Arizona, and California with the possibility that as many as 8,000 troops could head south as migrant caravans march toward the US-Mexico border.\n\nTroops have been running razor wire, constructing tent facilities, providing planning assistance, and training, NORTHCOM told BI Tuesday.\n\nThe largest troop deployment of the Trump presidency came as the president called the approaching streams of thousands of migrants an \"invasion\" and a national emergency requiring the advanced capabilities of the US military, a dramatic move that came in the days before the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\nAs troops are barred by law from law enforcement activities on US soil, the units deployed to the border have been relegated to a Title X support role, which involves constructing barriers, building bases, and offering logistics and other relevant assistance to Customs and Border Patrol.\n\nOver the past week, there have been reports that the Pentagon is assessing a much lower threat posed by the migrants than that of the White House, which has, at times, characterized the migrant groups as roaming gangs of violent criminals.\n\nThe Department of Defense said Monday that active-duty troops deployed to the border will not receive danger pay, additional compensation for activities in a dangerous environment.\n\nThe name change for the military's border mission, which critics have called a political stunt, occurred on Election Day. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who approved the deployment in response to a Department of Homeland Security request, responded to such accusations last week, saying, \"We don't do stunts in this department.\"\n\nDefense officials speculated to The Wall Street Journal that the decision to scrap \"Operation Faithful Patriot\" was made because the mission is not a true operation in the traditional sense of the word.", "Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was one of the first to pull out of Saudi Arabia's Future Investment conference in October after the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but the kingdom's now 10% stake in the ride-hailing company could cause problems as it races to go public.\n\nThe company's board held a \"marathon meeting\" last week, Bloomberg News reported, with all directors in attendance, including former CEO Travis Kalanick and Saudi official Othman Al-Rumayyan, who manages the kingdom's Public Investment Fund.\n\nSaudi Arabia, through \"direct and indirect holdings\" now owns more than 10% of Uber, Bloomberg also reported. That's double the 5% stake Uber said the kingdom had purchased in 2016 for $3.5 billion and could cause a headache for Uber as it races towards an IPO as soon as next year.\n\nAn Uber spokesperson declined to comment but confirmed the board did hold its regularly scheduled board meeting last week, as it does every quarter.\n\nRead more: Two of Uber's most popular services are joining forces as the company races toward an IPO\n\nLike Khosrowshahi and fellow Uber board-member Arianna Huffington, most of Wall Street was quick to shun the Saudi conference, colloquially known as \"Davos in the Desert.\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin all opted to skip the event, but Kalanick was seen in Riyadh that week, according to Bloomberg.\n\nSoftBank, another Uber investor, has also accepted $45 billion worth of funding for its investments, according to Bloomberg. The Japanese company's Vision Fund is heavily invested in transportation initiatives including GrabTaxi, GM Cruise, and Nvidia.\n\nLyft, Uber's closest competitor that's also racing toward an IPO, isn't immune to the Saudi shadow.

Under a section of the tax code, the Treasury Secretary must turn over the tax returns of any American if the forms are requested by the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee.\n\nRep. Richard Neal, the presumptive Democratic chair of the Ways and Means committee, told CNN that the committee will likely request the returns from the Internal Revenue Service, but it is unclear how long it will take to get them.\n\nDemocrats have consistently called on Trump to release his tax returns to ensure that the president is not benefitting from his time in office and that there are no conflicts of interest with Trump's dealings with foreign governments. But given the party's minority stance in Congress, they could not compel Trump to release the returns.\n\nBut with Democrats set to control the House, the party could attempt to force the president to turn over his returns as part of an investigation into Trump's business dealings. Rep. Eric Swalwell, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told NBC that the returns will be released eventually.\n\n\"The American people will see his tax returns, not because of any voyeuristic interest, but because they should know if he's corrupt,\" Swalwell said.\n\nTrump's returns once again came under scrutiny after a bombshell report from the New York Times that alleged the president and his father, Fred, fraudulently avoided millions of dollars in taxes over three decades.", "President Donald Trump blasted CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta during his post-midterm press conference on Wednesday, calling him a \"rude, terrible person\" and mocking CNN for its ratings.\n\nAcosta asked Trump why he referred to a migrant caravan traveling to the southern border of the US as an \"invasion\" and wondered whether he had \"demonized\" immigrants during the midterms.\n\n\"They're hundreds of miles away,\" Acosta said. \"That's not an invasion.\"\n\nTrump shot back: \"Honestly, I think you should let me run the country, you run CNN \u2014 and if you did it well, your ratings would be much higher.\"\n\nWhen Acosta then started asking a question on the investigation into Russian election interference, Trump cut him off to call it a \"hoax.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what: CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them,\" Trump said. \"You are a rude, terrible person.

Before Trident Juncture's official start on October 25, two Navy ships carrying Marines to Iceland for pre-exercises had to take shelter at Reykjavik. (The exercise ends on November 7.)\n\nOn one of them, the USS Gunston Hall, heavy seas damaged the well deck and landing craft and injured sailors.

In intense cold, \"the hydraulic oil starts to become too viscous, and the system is designed to operate at a certain level of viscosity, and if it starts to become too thick, the pressure goes up and you could end up blowing seals.\"\n\nSailors signal an E-2D Hawkeye ready for launch on the aircraft carrier USS Harry S.

You're out there exposed to the elements, and the bridge itself is not particularly insulated, because it's got a bunch of windows.\"\n\n\"It sort of affects people's performance, just because you're constantly cold,\" Clark added.\n\nOn surface ships, the masts and antennas sprouting from the superstructure can gather ice, affecting the performance of that equipment and even the handling of the ship \u2014 in extreme cases, the ship's centers of gravity and buoyancy can be affected.\n\nDe-icing solutions are available, but they aren't always effective on every surface. \"So you kind of have to constantly go up there and chip and clear ice off of the mast,\" Clark said.\n\nSailors on the guided-missile destroyer USS Farragut supervise the refueling probe during a replenishment-at-sea with fleet-replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn, October 20, 2018. US Navy/Mass Comm. Specialist 2nd Class Cameron M. Stoner\n\nEven below deck, the outside environment is still a factor.\n\n\"For the engineering plants, you use the seawater to cool a lot of your components,\" Clark said. \"In the case of a surface ship that's got gas-turbine power plants, you use that to cool the gas-turbine power plant, depending on how old the ship is.\"\n\nCooler water can make engines and other components more efficient, but water that's too cold can also take a toll.\n\n\"If you're trying to cool a gas-turbine generator ... there's kind of an ideal temperature range that you want to maintain it at,\" Clark said. \"So if the cooling water becomes too cold, it's hard to keep it in that normal range. It actually gets too cold, and you start to get less efficiency out of your turbine.\"\n\nUsing water that's too cold to cool components can also lead to condensation, which in turn can cause corrosion or short-circuits in electronics, Clark added.\n\n'Rebuilding our muscle memory'\n\nGunner's Mate 1st Class Christopher Carlson watches the Royal Norwegian navy frigate HNoMS Thor Heyerdahl pull alongside the USS Harry S.

Foggo himself has warned about Russian submarines \u2014 their land-attack cruise missiles in particular.\n\nDuring its deployment earlier this year, the Truman was joined by a larger-than-usual number of destroyers, which are outfitted with sophisticated anti-submarine-warfare gear.\n\n\"That's the primary trend up in the Northern Fleet,\" Clark said. \"So I imagine a lot of what the carrier strike group is doing up there is anti-submarine warfare.\"\n\nStegherr said strike group aircraft had carried out operations at sea and over land to support Trident Juncture and that \"the strike group conducted high-end air, surface and subsurface warfare operations\" with partner forces, which were meant \"to refine our network of capabilities able to respond rapidly and decisively to any potential situation.\"\n\nThe Truman strike group's presence in the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, and the Arctic Circle \"demonstrates to our allies and partners that we will uphold our commitments, regardless of the vastness or the unforgiving nature of the sea,\" Rear Adm. Gene Black, commander of the Truman strike group, said in a statement.\n\n\"This may be the first strike group to operate for this length of time this far north in many years, but it will not be the last.\"", "The following is a transcript of the video.\n\nSulfuric acid raining from the sky. Epic dust storms raging for months on end. And giant hurricanes that could swallow Earth whole. If you think Earth has some bad weather, think again.\n\nNow Mercury has little to no atmosphere, and therefore, no real weather to speak of. But you would feel the full brunt from the most powerful storms in our solar system called coronal mass ejections. These explosive storms form on the Sun and bathe Mercury's surface in high-energy radiation. So if the lack of oxygen and extreme temperatures don't kill you, the radiation certainly will.\n\nThis isn't as much of a problem on Venus, however. After all, the entire planet is covered with clouds. Bad news is, they're toxic. These clouds rain sulfuric acid that's so corrosive it would eat through your skin on contact.\n\nOn Mars the surface is rocky and desert-like. So wind can stir up loose soil, creating giant dust devils twice the height of Mt. Everest. But that's nothing compared to the dust storms that sometimes engulf the entire planet for months at a time.\n\nAnd the weather on Jupiter isn't any better. Of course, there's the Great Red Spot. A hurricane-like storm that's been raging for at least 300 years. But there's another storm on Jupiter that's equally powerful. With wind speeds twice as fast as a Category 5 hurricane. Its name is Oval BA. But is commonly called the Little Red Spot. Despite being about the size of Earth. And it's been growing in size since astronomers discovered it in 2000.\n\nNext door, is a weather phenomenon that's even larger: Saturn's north pole harbors a giant jetstream called \"The Hexagon.\" Each of its six distinct sides are larger than Earth itself! And at its center is a massive, rotating cloud system. That's 50 times larger than the average eye of a hurricane on Earth.\n\nMoving right along. Next up: Uranus. If you look at its tilt, you'll notice that Uranus spins on its side! Which makes its seasons more extreme than anywhere else in the solar system. For example, winter time has no sunlight. And because Uranus is so far from the sun, winter lasts the equivalent of 21 Earth years. That's 21 years with temperatures that can reach as low as -216 degrees Celsius.\n\nLast but not least is Neptune. You'll want to pack a windbreaker for this visit. Nicknamed \"the windiest planet,\" Neptune's strongest winds can exceed 1,930 kilometers per hour. That's one and a half times the speed of sound on Earth. And fast enough to fly from NY to LA in just 2.3 hours.\n\nSo maybe the acid rain, towering dust devils, and super-fast winds make our planet's weather look a little nicer- not too hot, not too cold, not too windy.

It weighs just over 2 pounds, which is 1 pound less than Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro and 0.75 pounds lighter than the new MacBook Air.\n\nDespite its small size, the laptop is packed with features that make it a great machine for students, frequent travelers, or people who use the computer for basic tasks. It's perfect for browsing the web and streaming from Netflix.\n\nThe MacBook has a high-resolution screen, so photos and videos will look clear and vibrant, and text will look incredibly sharp. Its 512 GB SSD is big enough to hold thousands of songs, hundreds of movies, and tens of thousands of documents without running out of space.\n\nThe MacBook's 8 GB of RAM (memory) and Intel Core i5 processor are more than enough power for 1080p video streaming, using Microsoft Office or Google's G Suite, or keeping a dozen or so browser tabs open while surfing the web.\n\nREUTERS/Robert Galbraith\n\nRead more:The best MacBooks you can buy\n\nThis machine is perfect for those everyday tasks, but it isn't powerful enough for intense uses, like high-resolution photo or video editing, or gaming. You're better off with a MacBook Pro if you plan to do things like that.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that the MacBook has one USB-C port, which can handle everything from charging the computer to connecting accessories. But because it has only one, you'll have to choose between plugging things in or charging the MacBook, just like an iPhone or iPad.\n\nIt also means you'll have to get an adapter to connect older USB accessories, which could be an issue if you regularly use many at the same time. If that's the case, you'll want a multi-port hub, which lets you connect multiple accessories and a charging cable to the MacBook at the same time.\n\nThe upside to having a laptop with USB-C is that you can easily charge it while you're on the go by plugging it into an external battery pack.\n\nIt may have a few limitations for power users, but this is the ultimate laptop for people who need a fully capable computer that doesn't take up much space. The 12-inch MacBook will easily fit into a student's or commuter's backpack, making it a great choice for high-school or college students and frequent travelers.\n\nIf you're looking for a thin and light laptop with more than enough power to get normal work done, the MacBook is an excellent choice, especially at this price.", "Bill Boulding, dean of Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, has a clear vision of what a successful alumnus looks like.\n\nIt's someone, he told Business Insider, who is \"able to look anyone in the eye and say, 'In my business, I'm making money.'\"\n\nAt the same time, Boulding said, \"you also have to be able to say, 'I'm making a positive difference in society through my business activity.'\"\n\nBoulding cited Fuqua's two most famous alumni \u2014 Apple CEO Tim Cook and Gates Foundation co-chair Melinda Gates \u2014 as examples of people taking the kind of initiative he hopes to see in graduates.\n\nRead more: The 35 best business schools in the US\n\nOf Apple, he said, \"It's no accident that they've become the most valuable company in the world because they're serving consumer needs in a way that they're helping to unlock human potential.\" Gates, on the other hand, has \"gone down a path of, 'What can we do to use the resources that we have to change lives for the better?'\"\n\nStill, Boulding admitted that it would be unfair to hold every Fuqua grad to the standard of becoming the next Cook or Gates. He mentioned some recent graduates who have, on a smaller scale, seized opportunities to make money and make an impact on society.\n\nOne alumnus bought a factory in their hometown in China because the residents were dependent on the factory for employment, and \"they wanted to make sure that their community was health and vibrant.\"\n\nOther people have innovated in the healthcare space, increasing access to healthcare services. Some work in the energy space, making sure that people have access to electricity without deleterious environmental consequences.\n\nThese alumni \"feel this commitment to their companies in a way that they want to be sure that their customers and their employees live high-quality lives,\" Boulding said. \"Given that it is an opportunity\" to changes lives for the better through business, \"it becomes an obligation to act upon that.\"", "When data analytics company Mixpanel started nine years ago, it faced many of the struggles startups often face: how to use its resources, what tools to buy, who to hire \u2014 and how to solve all of those problems on a limited budget.\n\nNow, Mixpanel wants to pay it forward to today's startups and nonprofits. On Wednesday, it announced that it would slash its software prices by 90% for startups and that it would give nonprofits 10,000 free users a month and an 80% discount for additional users.\n\n\"We went through quite a bit of growing pains and the struggles startups face when they're taking big risks,\" Mixpanel CEO Amir Movafaghi told Business Insider. \"We know how important it is to get every single resource along the way and help you accomplish your goals.\"\n\nThe motivation comes from Mixpanel's own story of growth. Founder and former CEO Suhail Doshi was only 20 years old when the company was formed in 2009, but Mixpanel has since scaled to 300 employees across offices in the US, London, and Singapore. Mixpanel is now valued at $865 million.\n\n\"We don't want price to be a hindrance,\" Movafaghi said. \"We're at a point in the company's life where we can afford to be part of an investment and be part of startup's success stories. We don't want affordability to be a constraint.\"\n\nMixpanel's platform helps customers use data to make product and marketing decisions for their companies. For instance, companies can use Mixpanel to scientifically test how popular a new website or app feature is compared to the old one.\n\nAs for nonprofits, they can use analytics to learn more about donor behavior and figure out how their company can make the most impact.\n\n\"The company has been on a journey to level the playing field,\" Movafaghi said. \"All the companies can have access to the data analysis. User analytics and help companies understand their user behaviors and help leverage that knowledge to build great products and experience.\"\n\nRead more: This former Twitter exec took over as CEO of an $865 million company \u2014 now, he explains his master plan to take on Google and his unusual reason to want to IPO\n\nFrom zero to hero\n\nCustomers like DocuSign and Mint have used Mixpanel since their early days. Since then, DocuSign went public earlier this year, and Mint was acquired by Intuit in 2009 for $170 million.\n\nThese kinds of discounts also benefit Mixpanel in the long run, Movafaghi said. Although in the short term they might lose out from these slashed prices, Mixpanel is willing to make that investment because if the startup becomes successful, it would then be a large-scale customer that could afford to shell out at full price for even more users. The discount is a gateway for startups to invest in analytics software over the long term, Movafaghi said.\n\n\"Effectively, if these companies grow and become successful, their pricing structure can evolve,\" Movafaghi said. \"It will no longer be a startup customer, it will be a successful, scaled customer.\"\n\nOriginally, Mixpanel had a free version with limited capabilities. However, they got feedback from customers who wanted more advanced capabilities but didn't have the budget to pay for the full range of Mixpanel's software.\n\n\"Based on all of what we've heard from startups over the years, we ultimately wanted to have a dedicated plan that scaled with them,\" Movafaghi said.\n\nIn today's landscape, Movafaghi said, data analytics are a \"necessary component, not a luxury.\" When startups are on a budget, they may not prioritize paying for data analytics software, but he hopes that this discount frees up some resources.\n\n\"It's the same struggle that almost all startups go through, in terms of being mindful of how they deploy their resources. Every dollar counts,\" Movafaghi said. \"They can leverage Mixpanel for a lot of data infrastructure and analysis and dedicate resources to building products that will be successful.\"", "President Donald Trump Ralph Freso/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday night lost the House of Representatives to the Democrats, who seized at least 26 seats from the Republicans.\n\nA majority-Democrat House threatens to stymie Trump's agenda and could lead to the investigation of his administration. But, all told, he didn't do so badly.\n\nIn midterm elections, a president's party loses a handful of seats. For former President Barack Obama, midterm elections in 2010 and 2014 were catastrophic compared to Trump's moderate losses.\n\nIn 2010, Obama lost 63 House seats. Even if every House race undecided at time of publication gets called for the Democrats, Trump will have lost about half as many seats as Obama did during his first midterm.\n\nIn 2014, Obama lost just 13 House seats, but he lost them in a House already packed with Republicans. In the end, Democrats held just 188 seats to 247 for Republicans. Additionally, in 2014, Obama lost the Senate.\n\nTrump managed to keep his hold of the Senate, where the Republican majority may even increase. Republicans in this midterm benefited from having only nine seats up for grabs in the senate, compared to 26 for Democrats and the Independents who caucus with them.\n\nAdditionally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell may have hurt Senate Democrats' ability to campaign by skipping the customary senatorial recess in August.\n\nRead more: They may have lost Florida, but Tuesday's governor's races were a major victory for the Democrats\n\nBut however Trump and the Republicans did it, they managed to hold up pretty well. Bill Clinton lost 52 House seats in 1994 during his first midterm.\n\nGeorge W. Bush stands as the only recent example of a president gaining seats after his first midterm in 2002, directly in the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks. Even then, Bush gained just eight House seats and two in the Senate.\n\n\"Last night the Republican party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House,' Trump said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nIt undoubtedly sounds odd for Trump to call the loss of around 30 House seats a \"Big Victory,\" as he already has on Twitter. But, given the historical context of midterm elections, the victory here may be in that he suffered a smaller than expected loss.", "Michael Kors shares tanked early Wednesday morning after the retailer reported worse-than-expected earnings results for the second quarter.\n\nSame-store sales dropped 2.1% at its namesake brand. Meanwhile, sales at Jimmy Choo\u2014 the luxury footwear brand that it acquired last November \u2014 were stronger than expected.\n\n\"After slowly climbing the steep hill of recovery, Michael Kors now appears to be rolling back down in reverse,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\nSaunders attributed Michael Kors' woes to a brand image problem.\n\n\"It still suffers from a lack of definition and a reputation tarnished by years of ubiquity,\" he wrote.\n\n\"While there is nothing wrong with a luxury brand being edgy or even gaudy, we would argue that there is a subtle distinction between this and being seen as lowbrow \u2014 and unfortunately for Michael Kors, it falls squarely into the latter camp. This is a shame as some parts of the range are appealing, but these gems get lost in a sea of 'stuff.'\"\n\nWhile Michael Kors has been trying to reposition itself as a high-end retailer and making the brand less available to the mass market by reducing its promotions, as long as its products continue to line the racks of discounters like TJ Maxx, it's unlikely to be seen as a luxurious brand.\n\nSaunders said that Michael Kors also suffers from having a number of different labels at different price points, which all fall under one brand.\n\nIt's \"difficult to justify a $2,450 Michael Kors Collection handbag when a Michael by Michael Kors clutch bag is available in Macy's Last Act clearance section for a little under $51,\" he wrote.\n\nMichael Kors' earnings results stand in stark contrast to Tapestry-owned brand Coach, which is one of its leading competitors and has been executing a successful turnaround effort to reclaim its luxury status.

Their leadership was showcased prominently last year as the S&P 500 maintained a record streak of daily gains without a 5% drop.\n\nBut disappointing news from the past two earnings seasons has challenged their leadership status, from Facebook's miss on active users in Q2 to Apple's soft guidance for the all-important holiday quarter.\n\nNow, as markets settle down after a tumultuous October, investors who've taken profits on tech stocks should look to invest them elsewhere, according to Alicia Levine, the chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, which oversees $1.9 trillion in assets.\n\n\"I just don't see large-cap tech regaining its former leadership role, and it's sort of a trap now,\" Levine told Business Insider.\n\nLevine is advising investors to curb their enthusiasm about market-wide gains heading into the new year. 2019, she said, is going to be a more typical year, in which expectations for earnings growth peak early and decline in the following months. While she's bullish on market returns for the next six to nine months, Levine warned that painful losses may also lie ahead for investors.\n\nShe recommends healthcare stocks, including health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, which provide insurance for a fixed monthly fee.\n\nThis pick was informed by the widely expected outcome of the midterm elections: Democrats recaptured the House, and Republicans maintained their Senate majority. The implication of this result is that a repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare \u2014 or big cuts to Medicaid are unlikely.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in Idaho and Nebraska opted to expand access to their Medicaid programs for more low-income earners, in line with similar decisions taken by 34 other states and Washington, DC, under the Affordable Care Act. Pharmaceutical stocks will benefit as Obamacare becomes more institutionalized, Levine said.\n\nThe sector, along with biotech, has been battered in recent months. Their sell-offs should limit their downside if lawmakers ramp up efforts to regulate drug pricing, Levine said.\n\nThese sector rotations that Levine recommends could be daunting for people who have profited from the boom of tech companies during this bull market. They include investors in the several growth mutual funds that own these stocks and the cohorts of workers who buy on autopilot through their retirement plans.\n\n\"People don't know what they own,\" Levine said. \"And when the selling starts, it's indiscriminate.\"\n\nThese popular tech stocks have recently been plagued by data and privacy scandals, from Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook to the Google+ data breach. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have taken notice, and they pose another risk to the sector's unbridled growth.\n\n\"There's a sense that winter is coming, that there will be regulation, and there's an appetite both on the right and the left for this,\" Levine said. \"You could see this being something that both a Democratic House and the administration would have an interest in.\"", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Microsoft\n\nTraditionally, Microsoft has been known as a software company, but in recent years that has been changing \u2014 the company has been releasing well-reviewed and highly anticipated hardware too. That has all culminated in Microsoft's latest lineup, which includes the new Microsoft Surface Laptop 2.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 2 already has a lot going for it. It features a super sleek design, options for powerful specs, and a great display. It's also a little pricey, starting at $999.\n\nIs it worth the cash?\n\nAs with any new product, the first thing you'll notice about the new Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 is its design, and it's a beautiful piece of hardware. The outside of the laptop is sleek and stylish and comes in a few different colors \u2014 including Black, Platinum, Burgundy, and Cobalt Blue. Notably, the Black version is new \u2014 and we loved the beautiful look and feel of the Black model, complete with a glossy black logo on the lid, black keyboard keys, and so on.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 2 comes in a few different colors \u2014 including Black, Platinum, Burgundy, and Cobalt Blue. Microsoft\n\nThe laptop itself is relatively portable, which is always helpful. It comes in at 12.13 x 8.79 x 0.57 inches, with a weight of 2.76 pounds. That's about middle of the road for a 13-inch laptop \u2014 it's not as light as the Surface Pro, which comes in at around 1.6 pounds, or the Samsung Notebook 9, which is 1.8 pounds. Still, we found the laptop to be easy to carry, and even forget about when it's in a backpack.\n\nOne of the things that sets the Microsoft Surface Laptop apart from other laptops is the soft Alcantra fabric that surrounds the keyboard, and we quite like it. It makes resting your hands on the keyboard nicer and a little warmer than a metal laptop. Over time, the finish may wear a little, but if you get a darker color that wear may not show up quite as much.\n\nSpeaking of the keyboard, Microsoft claims that it's quieter than ever on the Surface Laptop 2\u2014 something that we can definitely confirm.\n\nEven those only a few meters away may not be able to hear typing, which is very helpful in an office environment or when you're typing with others around. It feels pretty good too \u2014 there's plenty of travel to make for a nice, tactile typing experience, and the spacing of the keys is pretty good too.\n\nOn the edges of the laptop, you'll find a standard USB port, a mini DisplayPort, a headphone jack, and a Surface Connect port, which is used for charging. That's really not as many ports as we would have liked to see. For starters, Microsoft really should have included at least one USB-C port given the fact that it's the port of the future, and an SD card slot would have been nice too.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 2, as you'd expect, features Windows 10, but unlike the original Surface Laptop, the new device does away with Windows 10 S, which is a good thing. Microsoft\n\nThe display is nice too.\n\nIt comes in at 13.5 inches, with a resolution of 2,256 x 1,504 and a 3:2 aspect ratio. It's a touch display too \u2014 so when the trackpad and keyboard aren't enough, simply reach out and control the device with your hands. Colors on the display, we found, were vivid and deep. The computer isn't a 2-in-1 \u2014 you can't detach the display \u2014 but the touch support is still a nice addition. Above the display is a 720p front-facing camera, which supports Windows Hello. Windows Hello essentially allows you to unlock your computer with your face \u2014 and we found that it was fast and convenient.\n\nUnder the hood, the Surface Laptop 2 has a lot to offer.\n\nThe base model comes with an eighth-gen Intel Core i5 quad-core processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, but it can be upgraded with up to an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and up to a 1TB hard drive. Safe to say, the base model will be more than powerful enough for most people who might web-browse email, and watch Netflix every now and then. For those that want a little more power, however, the ranged-up options might be the way to go. It's also worth comparing those specs to similar models. You can get a Dell XPS 13 with the exact same specs for $930, which is a little cheaper. You can also get similar specs in the new MacBook Air \u2014 but it starts at $1,199.\n\nThe battery life of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 officially comes in at 14 hours and 30 minutes of video playback, and while we didn't quite hit that, it's safe to say that the battery life on the laptop is really quite good. It's a little longer than the battery on the Dell XPS 13, which is one of the laptop's main competitors.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 2, as you would expect, features Windows 10 \u2014 but unlike the original Surface Laptop, the new device does away with Windows 10 S, which is a good thing. The lightweight version of Windows isn't bad for some uses, but in a $1,000-plus laptop, you really should get the full version of Windows.\n\nUltimately, the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 is one of the best laptops you can buy, and should definitely be considered for those looking for a high-end laptop for work, home use, or anything else. It's not cheap \u2014 but it is a flagship-quality product.\n\nBut are there better options? Well, that depends.\n\nThe aforementioned Dell XPS 13 is another excellent choice, and it offers a similar-sized display in a smaller package. It also offers a beautiful edge-to-edge display, and a much better selection of ports. In the end, for most users, it's the better choice. That said, that doesn't mean you should avoid the Surface Laptop 2 \u2014 if you like the soft-touch finish, need a slightly better keyboard, and don't mind paying a little extra for a laptop with fewer ports, the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 is the way to go.\n\nShop the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 starting at $999 at Microsoft or Best Buy.", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.\n\nWorldwide mobile subscription app engagement, measured by install-to-conversion rates for paid subscriptions, increased 32% year-over-year (YoY) in 2018, according to Leanplum and Liftoff's 2018 Mobile App Engagement Index.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThe report, which studied 257 billion impressions across 58.4 million installs from September 2017 to August 2018, found that global subscription app engagement jumped to 3.3%, up from 2.5% in 2017.\n\nThe rise in subscription app engagement is a boon for developers, as the subscription app model provides them with more consistent revenue streams. That's because subscription apps generate revenue from recurring weekly or monthly payments from established consumers, rather than unpredictable, one-off purchases, for example.\n\nThe cost of acquiring subscription app users is decreasing, making this app model even more attractive to developers. Specifically, the average cost of acquiring paying mobile app subscribers decreased 46% YoY to $87 in 2018, compared with $162 in 2017.\n\nDespite the fact that subscription apps are promising to developers and becoming even more attractive, paid apps shouldn't be overlooked. The acquisition cost for a user on purchase apps, which are apps like eBay that enable users to shop for items in-app, is just $40 \u2014 54% less than for subscription app users. So, although subscription apps provide attractive monetization benefits in the long term, there are less expensive app models that companies with limited marketing budgets can take advantage of.\n\nFor mobile app developers that are keen on deploying subscription apps, iOS users represent the best return on investment. iOS users' average engagement rate for subscription apps was 3.4%, more than double the engagement rate among Android users, which was 1.6%. Additionally, the average acquisition cost for an iOS user was only $129, or 45% less expensive than the $187 average cost for an Android user.", "How are you supposed to book a room that isn't listed on a hotel's website?\n\nWell, the point, as reported by Bloomberg, is that you probably can't, unless you're connected enough to have heard about it by word of mouth.\n\nThat's often the case with ultra-luxurious rooms and suites that high-end hotels purposely omit from their listings. There are no photographs, no descriptions, and no prices available; to anyone who isn't in the know, it's as if they don't exist.\n\nHotels keep such rooms secret for a variety of reasons, whether protecting the hotel's assets or protecting the guest's identity and privacy.\n\nThen, of course, there's the thrill of exclusivity. As The New York Times put it, hotels use these unlisted rooms \"as a way to delight valued guests or generate buzz.\"\n\nRead more:A 5-star boutique in Switzerland with a world-famous infinity pool no longer has to pay for advertising, thanks to Instagram\n\nThese rooms go by a variety of terms \u2014 owner's suites, partnership suites \u2014 but one thing they have in common is a hefty price tag.\n\nTake, for example, Blue Lagoon\u2014 one of Iceland's most recognizable tourist attractions. The Retreat is a luxury hotel with 62 suites that can be booked online, some of which offer direct access to the lagoon. But tucked away within The Retreat is The Blue Lagoon Suite. There's no mention of it on The Retreat's site, but, according to Bloomberg, it goes for $10,050 a night \u2014 and requires a minimum two-night stay.\n\nBooking details vary for these unlisted rooms. In some cases, an interested guest has to call ahead and specifically request the suite. Other hotels require that their penthouse suites be booked by email in advance, so that managers have time to vet the guest before making a decision.\n\nEven if booking an unlisted hotel room is a bit (or a lot) out of your budget, there are still ways to customize your five-star hotel experience with some semisecret perks. That can include free Champagne or chocolate-covered strawberries and even special decorations in your room.\n\nAnd hotels aren't the only businesses that build a name for some of their products \u2014 if not their entire brands \u2014 by choosing not to advertise them. Consider Goyard, a two-century-old Parisian brand.\n\nAs Business Insider's Hillary Hoffower previously reported: \"Goyard's prime press strategy is silence. It forgoes any advertising, e-commerce, and celebrity endorsements. It rarely grants interviews and very occasionally makes products available to the mass market.\"\n\nClearly, in some cases, not talking about your luxury product is the best way to make people want it.", "The best feature of the Google Home Hub, hands down, is the ability to use it as a digital photo frame.\n\nI know, I know. Photo frames seem so mid-aughts. We've moved past that technology, right?\n\nWell, maybe not.\n\nWhat makes this Home Hub feature so great is that it pulls images of people and places you've preapproved from your Google Photos account. The device will automatically eliminate ones that are blurry or are of things like receipts.\n\nThe photos show up when you're not using the device \u2014 it's one of the \"ambient modes.\" But you can also have the display show a full-screen clock or an art gallery.\n\nThe Home Hub doesn't just show an endless slideshow of random images. Over time, I've noticed the device displaying collages or side-by-side images with the same subject. I didn't tell it to do that \u2014 it just figured out that I might like to see two photos of, say, my sister's dog, right next to each other.\n\nI have noticed the feature gets tripped up from time to time. My niece and nephew looked very similar as newborns, and sometimes Google Assistant thinks it's showing me a few photos of the same baby when it's not. Otherwise, however, it's been pretty accurate.\n\nThe reason this feature has been my favorite is simple: It consistently brings me joy, and it makes the people who visit my apartment happy too. My parents and sister have all visited me in the past few weeks, and they've been delighted by the family photos scrolling by on the display. The Home Hub will often show me a photo I've forgotten about or an image from a vacation, and it makes me happy every time.", "When staying at a hotel for more than one night, my biggest priority is competence. I don't need to be blown away; I just don't want to have any major concerns.\n\nI stayed at a DoubleTree by Hilton for three nights during a recent trip to Little Rock, Arkansas, and came away satisfied, if not wowed, by every part of my experience. It was clean and comfortable, served above-average food, and featured good service from friendly employees. That may sound like a middling review, but it's exactly what I look for in a hotel.\n\nI've stayed in low-budget motels (in one instance, I narrowly avoided bedbugs by happening to choose the non-infested bed in a two-bed room), high-end resorts (which are excellent but not worth the exorbitant prices), and hotels that fall somewhere in the middle, and I've found the options between the two extremes to be best suited to my preferences.\n\nThe DoubleTree in Little Rock falls on the more expensive end of non-luxury hotels, and it was among the more expensive hotel options in the city. While, at $146.88 per night, it was more expensive than I usually prefer, its rates are well beneath what a Ritz-Carlton or Four Seasons demands.\n\nIn the American Customer Satisfaction Index's 2018 survey ranking hotel brands, DoubleTree placed near the middle (19th out of 32 brands), which seemed about right.\n\nHere's what I thought about my three nights at the DoubleTree in Little Rock, Arkansas.", "Bryce Harper turned down a contract offer that was described as \"aggressive\" and \"historic,\" according to The Washington Post's Chelsea Janes.\n\nAccording to Janes, Harper received an offer worth $300 million over 10 years, with no opt-outs from the Nationals on the last day of the team's final homestand.\n\nAs Janes noted, there's incentive from both sides to talk up the offer. The Nationals want to send the message that they're genuinely trying to retain Harper while Harper's agent, Scott Boras, can send the message that other teams will have to go higher.\n\nThe offer did not go as high as $400 million, which some in the baseball world thought Harper could earn on the open market.\n\nThe Nationals had exclusive negotiating rights with Harper at the time. Now, Harper can speak to other teams, and the report of a $300 million offer may force teams to go higher.\n\nHarper and Boras' goal may be to exceed the $325 million contract Giancarlo Stanton signed in 2014.\n\nJanes wrote that Boras has a history of collecting offers, then going back to the home team to see if they will match it or exceed it. In an offseason when teams like the New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, and more, might get in on the bidding, if the Nationals want to keep their star outfielder, they may have to go even higher.", "Shoppers in Washington DC know how to save money \u2014 they clip 2.7 times more coupons than average.

At the end of a busy work day, I've often closed out my tabs feeling exhausted, but also somewhat confounded. What did I even do today? Am I actually becoming the writer I want to be? Lots of questions, zero answers. And as my questions piled up, so did the self-doubt and second-guessing.\n\nSo I decided to make a change. I started setting aside time every day to recognize what I'd done and thereby keep tabs on my progress toward short- and long-term goals.\n\nI've always been a fan of working smarter and setting up systems that work with my natural tendencies rather than against them. I set goals for everything from my career and finances, to physical and mental health, to personal growth and relationships.\n\nI'm also the type of person who believes that a solid spreadsheet or a well-crafted document can do way more than most people give them credit for. So when I moved into freelance writing almost a year ago, I created almost a dozen documents in an attempt to make sure I accomplished everything I wanted to do.\n\nI quickly realized that wasn't going to cut it, though, since it took up way more time than I expected. And, to be honest, I was more addicted to the goal-setting than I was inspired by the thought of actually living up to them. Recognizing that, I opted to go cold-turkey and just do the work and see where that got me.\n\nUnsurprisingly, that didn't work either. I'm the kind of person who needs a balance of structure and free-flowing creativity. But I didn't know what that kind of work-style looked like on a daily basis. I'd never seen anything like it in all my time researching productivity hacks and expert advice from other freelance writers who had years of experience under their collective belts.\n\nI grew tired of seeing weeks pass with seemingly little to show for it and feeling less-than-confident in my abilities. So I decided to make time every single day to force myself to recognize all the little things I'd accomplished that day. It's a 10-minute daily exercise that forces me to focus on the reality of my progress. It's just short enough that I can't justify skipping it, but long enough that I can find some meaningful insight. It also lets me adjust my goals from lofty to realistic and attainable.\n\nBut I didn't arrive at my system without a crucial piece of introspection and self-acceptance: I realized the fact that I am, much to my chagrin, a people pleaser. Don't get me wrong - I love setting goals for myself, and I especially love filling out spreadsheets and worksheets and ticking off boxes on my to-do list. But I tend to do better when I have some sort of external source of motivation spurring me on.\n\nThat was always missing from my goal-setting exercises. I would write down all of these things I wanted to do \u2014 start running regularly, pitch one of my dream publications, have a super-productive morning routine \u2014 but they were all solely dependent on willpower.\n\nRead more: How I customize my Gmail to boost my productivity\n\nI've always heard that willpower is like a muscle: It gets easier to use the more you exercise it. I don't know if that's true. If it is, getting over the initial difficulty of flexing that particular muscle is enough to make me want to give up before I've started. But, as I've come to realize, having someone to spot you along the way in no way diminishes your progress.\n\nThat's why I set aside one of my daily review time slots to focus on my weekly progress by way of a check-in phone call or video chat with my best friend. We take 15 to 20 minutes to discuss our progress on everything from getting a difficult assignment done to finally scheduling that appointment that's been put off for way too long. And since we live 3,000 miles away from each other, it helps keep us up-to-date on what's going on in each other's lives.\n\nEven though I almost never accomplish all of my goals (a fact which the perfectionist in me still cringes at), I can see the progress I'm making with every little step forward. I never had that kind of validation before and it has, for the most part, kept me from sliding back into the self-defeating mindset that's plagued me since college.\n\nI'm able to recognize the fact that I have to give myself time to reach those ultimate goals I've set for myself. And, even more importantly, I now measure myself against the person I was yesterday, rather than the idealized version of myself I can never quite reach. That makes it easier to appreciate my hard work, instead of getting hung up on all the things I'm not doing \"right.\" And that's had a huge impact on my self-confidence.", "While Democrats and Republicans split control of the two chambers of Congress in Tuesday's midterm elections, scandal-plagued candidates in high-profile races ran the table.\n\nTwo Republican House members currently under federal indictment won reelection in their races, while two Democrats who are not currently under investigation but were dogged by scandals also took home wins.\n\nThe indicted Republicans\n\nRep. Duncan Hunter, who represents California's 50th congressional district just outside of San Diego, won despite being under indictment for campaign finance violations. Authorities allege that Hunter and his wife used roughly $250,000 in campaign cash for personal expenses ranging from shorts to dentist visits. In total, Hunter faces 60 indictments for finance violations.\n\nHunter has denied the allegations, claiming that his wife managed his finances and that the indictment was a political hit job by the Department of Justice. A status conference for Hunter is scheduled for early December, but no firm trial date has been set.\n\nRead more: Trump has a new excuse for declining to release his tax returns as Democrats prepare investigative blitz\n\nIn New York, Rep. Chris Collins won reelection in the state's 27th district despite being charged with insider trading by federal authorities in August.\n\nAuthorities say Collins engaged in a conspiracy with his son and other associates to dump shares of a Australian pharmaceutical firm after learning that a key drug trial had failed. Collins served on the board of the company and was privy to the drug trial's results before they became public. Federal officials say Collins made a call to his son about the stock while in attendance at a White House event.\n\nCollins has promised to fight the charges.\n\nThe dogged Democrats\n\nOn the other side, two high-profile Democrats also managed to win their respective races despite nagging scandals.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bob Menendez won reelection in New Jersey after being cleared of corruption charges in late 2017. Federal prosecutors declined to retry Menendez in January after a hung jury did not convict the senator on charges he accepted roughly $1 million in illegal gifts and donations.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Menendez accepted gifts from Salomon Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor from Florida, including private jet trips, in exchange for the senator's influence on key issues, including a Medicare billing dispute. Menendez denied the allegations.\n\nThe race appeared to be getting closer in the run up to Election Day, with Democrats diverting money to shore up Menendez's victory.\n\nIn addition to Menendez, Keith Ellison, the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee and a former House member, won election as Minnesota Attorney General amid allegations of domestic and emotional abuse made by ex-girlfriend Karen Monahan.\n\nEllison has not been charged with any crime and an investigation by the state's Democrats Party found that the allegations were \"unsubstantiated.\"", "At the beginning of the college basketball season, blowout contests are par for the course. Fans are used to watching the top teams in the country annihilate no-name squads in what amount to glorified exhibition games for the majority of November.\n\nThis year was supposed to be different. The Champions Classic kicked off the 2018-19 college basketball season with a pair of games matching up top-10 teams that were expected to be competitive.\n\nBut the Duke Blue Devils still managed to secure an early season blowout, and it came against the No. 2 team in the country.\n\nThe fourth-ranked Blue Devils dealt head coach John Calipari the worst defeat of his career at any level Tuesday night with a 118-84 rout of his Kentucky Wildcats. The marquee matchup between Duke and the Wildcats \u2014 who were co-favorites to win the 2019 NCAA Championship heading into Tuesday night's contest \u2014 became a show for the Blue Devil freshmen who comprised the nation's best recruiting class of the year and maybe ever. Duke's freshmen outscored the entire Kentucky roster with a combined 89 points on the night.\n\nAP preseason All-America selection R.J. Barrett erupted for 33 points, 6 assists, and 4 rebounds to break the previous scoring record for a Blue Devil freshman in their debut. In just 23 minutes on the floor, social media sensation Zion Williamson also surpassed that 25-point benchmark set by Marvin Bagley III against the Elon Phoenix last season with 28 points and 7 rebounds.\n\nHeading into the season, the biggest question surrounding Williamson was whether or not he could actually shoot. He silenced his naysayers early, sinking a three-point attempt for the first points of his college career and shooting a whopping 85 percent from the field on the night.\n\nAnd, of course, he added more highlights from there:\n\nClassmates Cam Reddish and Tre Jones proved themselves in their debuts as well. Reddish \u2014 a sharpshooting small forward and the No. 3 recruit in the class of 2018 \u2014 notched 22 points on 6-of-14 shooting from the floor and drained three shots from beyond the arc. Jones \u2014 a five-star point guard and the younger brother of Duke 2014 national champion Tyus Jones \u2014 dropped a game-high seven dimes in the trouncing of what was universally considered one of the best teams in the country.\n\n\"When you start four freshmen, no matter how talented they are, you don't know what they are going to do in this environment against an outstanding team and a great program,\" Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said, per Steve Wiseman at The News & Observer. \"And they responded. They were magnificent tonight.\"", "Several Democratic senators who lost their seats in Tuesday's midterm elections had one thing in common \u2014 they all voted against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.\n\nGOP Sen. Lindsey Graham called it \"Kavanaugh's Revenge\" in a statement Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Virtually all Senate Democrats running in Trump states who voted against Brett Kavanaugh were defeated,\" Graham said in the statement. \"Their constituents held them responsible for being part of a despicable smear campaign orchestrated by the left. These Democrats showed more allegiance to the left than to their constituents who support qualified, conservative judges like Brett Kavanaugh.\"\n\nThe wrangling over Kavanaugh's confirmation hit a fever pitch in October when several women accused Kavanaugh of various forms of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe most prominent allegation came from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, a California professor who said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two of them were in high school in the 1980s. Kavanaugh, who was eventually confirmed to the nation's highest court, denied her accusation in a fiery televised rebuttal.\n\nRead more: Opinion pages in some of the nation's top publications reveal the deep divide on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court\n\nDespite Kavanaugh's denial, the FBI opened a weeklong investigation into the allegations. That investigation failed to bolster the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, and senators moved to hold a final vote on his confirmation.\n\nA handful of senators were strongly opposed to Kavanaugh's nomination, including Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, and Bill Nelson of Florida.\n\nAll of those senators lost their seats on Tuesday night.\n\nHeitkamp said she decided to vote against Kavanaugh after witnessing his aggressive response to whether he had ever consumed alcohol to the point of losing consciousness.\n\n\"I saw somebody who was very angry, who was very nervous, and I saw rage that a lot of people said, 'well of course you're going to see rage, he's being falsely accused,' but it is at all times you're to acquit yourself with a demeanor that's becoming of the court,\" Heitkamp said.\n\nDonnelly said he voted against Kavanaugh after being swayed by Ford's testimony.\n\n\"As I have made clear before, sexual assault has no place in our society,\" Donnelly said in a prepared statement, cited by the Indianapolis Star. \"When it does occur, we should listen to the survivors and work to ensure it never happens again.\"\n\nMcCaskill said her decision to vote against Kavanaugh was not a result of the looming sexual assault allegations against him, but because of his view on executive powers amid the FBI investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"[My] decision is not based on those allegations but rather on his positions on several key issues, most importantly the avalanche of dark, anonymous money that is crushing our democracy,\" McCaskill wrote in her prepared written statement, according to NPR. McCaskill added that she was \"also uncomfortable about his view on presidential power as it relates to the rule of law, and his position that corporations are people.\"\n\nNelson said he admired Ford's bravery for testifying about about the troubling allegations before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"She was expressing for millions of women in this country \u2026 that sexual assault has happened to them,\" Nelson said during a televised debate against his opponent, former Republican Gov. Rick Scott, cited by the Sun Sentinel. \"She was doing that in front of 11 Republican men who seemed to dismiss it.\"\n\nSee more: Here's the final count of which senators voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh", "Democrats were hoping to see Stacey Abrams elected as the nation's first black female governor Tuesday night, and although she hasn't conceded the Georgia race by Wednesday morning, current numbers show Republican Brian Kemp winning.\n\nThe Georgia race was perhaps the closest watched governor's race in the country, along with Florida, where another Democratic hopeful, Andrew Gillum, lost to a Republican.\n\nBut overall, the night was widely a success for the Democrats, who flipped seven states.\n\nThe Republicans only flipped one, Alaska, which was previously governed by an Independent, Bill Walker.\n\nRead more: Stacey Abrams, the Oprah-endorsed Democratic candidate, hints at a possible runoff against Republican Brian Kemp in the Georgia governor's race\n\nThe results of the gubernatorial races will no doubt be heralded as a rebuke of President Donald Trump by the Democrats.

Applebee's sales were plummeting, and the company was closing dozens of locations as it struggled to reach millennial diners. IHOP was largely remaining steady.\n\nMany \u2014 including this reporter \u2014 were skeptical that a new CEO could turn around two tired brands in the notoriously uncool casual- and family-dining business.\n\nYet, Joyce pulled it off. Applebee's US same-store sales were up 5.5% in the first nine months of 2018, while IHOP's increased 1%. The Dollarita kicked off a cheap-drinks revolution at Applebee's, while IHOP redefined what it means for a campaign to go viral with its polarizing IHOb name change.\n\n\"I love that line, Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining,' 'We're back!'\" Joyce said in a far-ranging interview with Business Insider and Amy Mason, Dine Brands' senior vice president of communications and consumer insights, last week.\n\nJoyce talked about subjects as varied as President Donald Trump's tariffs and the singer Melissa Etheridge being a fan of Applebee's. Here's what the CEO had to say about changing the company's culture, making comebacks, planning new brands for Dine, and much more.\n\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBusiness Insider: It's a good earnings to be doing interviews after.\n\nSteve Joyce: The fact that Applebee's has the highest comp sales growth in the restaurant business \u2014 it is really fun. Both brands are doing well, and they're both doing fun stuff.\n\nIHOP is \"The Grinch\" today, which actually was my favorite TV show of all time. I know all the Whos down in Whoville. It just had such great heart. I didn't like the Jim Carrey one, because it was scary. This one apparently is going back to the original. When we've done movie ties \u2014 this is my first domestic one \u2014 we do them internationally, they work well for us. We're actually doing the Grinch internationally as well.\n\nBoth brands are having fun. This October Applebee's was the zombie, and we got a lot of buzz around that. And then, did you see IHOP pumpkin [pancake]-flavored beer?\n\nWe got 30 million hits off of that. The teams are having fun, they're doing some things that are innovative and changing the nature of how people view our brands. I think people are viewing them as fun and they're viewing it as, \"These guys don't take themselves too seriously, and they're a little edgy.\"\n\nPeople love the music that goes with the Applebee's [commercials]. The new pasta ones have Etta James singing \"Cadillac,\" Dean Martin singing ... I always say \"when the moon hits your eye.\"\n\nAmy Mason: Amore. \"That's Amore.\"\n\nJoyce: Amore. \"That's Amore.\" And then, Applebee's used Melissa Etheridge's \"Come To My Window\" for their carryout message.\n\nI was giving John [Cywinski, Applebee's president] a hard time, because this guy wrote this really screaming article about how there are certain rock anthems that are above commercialism and that it's a shame that we did that.\n\nWell it turns out, Melissa Etheridge loved what we did and wants to do another song with us! And she said, \"And I'll do the voiceover!\" And I go, I wanted to write the guy back, I go: \"Well my good friend Melissa and I had a conversation. She said you're wrong!\"\n\nWinning over the skeptics\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nBI: A year ago, I was definitely one of the skeptics.\n\nJoyce: I remember.\n\nBI: Yes. But, I said if you guys give me a comeback story, I'll write a comeback story. And you have done that. So when did you get that ball rolling?\n\nJoyce: I love that line, Jack Nicholson in \"The Shining,\" \"We're back!\"\n\nWe deliberately set out to stop talking about menus and restaurants and plates and instead try to capture the hearts and minds of, first, the folks that work for us. That's the way we start telling customers we're not selling you plates with food. We're selling memorable dining experiences with great food and great service.\n\nThat's something everybody can relate to. I don't know anybody that doesn't want to be part of something bigger than themselves, right?\n\nIt's a performance-based value culture where we talk about who we are and how we do our business and how we care for each other. And then the big thing is, in my experience, nobody believes corporations anymore. And they shouldn't, 'cause corporations say that s--- all the time. I'm sorry.\n\nBut you know, my thing is, you've got to live it. When you show people that you mean it, then they believe. Do they believe in the company, no. But they do believe in the people. We can see it in our engagement surveys that people are saying: \"Hey we told you we had problems with the work-life balance shift, and you did things. We told you we wanted to be communicated more, you did things. We told you we wanted more recognition, you did things. We told you we were interested in being able to care for our families in ways that we weren't, you did things.\"\n\nI think we're gaining some important credibility with an organization that needed that. They needed to see that they could be part of something that was meaningful that wasn't contrived. I think we've built a good leadership team that has united around those values. Now, the big thing is: How do we integrate it every day so that it's not a program, so it's not words that are laminated on a card or written on a wall, but it's the way we care about our people? I think people are sensing that, and therefore I think they're willing to go the extra mile. We're also giving people a latitude to do some things that are out there.\n\nSomebody said well what do you do? I go, \"What do you mean?\" In terms of creative? Zero. But I say \"yes.\" You know the IHOb deal, that was the agency's pitch. But the team was really behind it \u2014 44 billion impressions, I think they were right.\n\nMillennials aren't killing IHOP and Applebee's\n\nApplebee's. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nBI: Before IHOb launched, what were you expecting? How did things go from there?\n\nJoyce: We thought it was going to be very fun. Somebody said, \"I think we can get 30, 40 million impressions on this,\" and we said, \"Wow, that'd really be great.\" 44 billion. So.\n\nMason: I said, \"Yeah it's really clever.\"\n\nBI: I don't think anyone expected that one.\n\nJoyce: Right away, several experts came out and said, \"Only an idiot would mess with an iconic brand like IHOP.\" The same experts like nine days later said, \"They have reinvented social media for the next decade.\" I don't think either's quite true, maybe somewhere in the middle. But it was fun.\n\nWe have a very young demographic in the brand. Over half the IHOP customers are under 34. Thirty-five percent and growing of Applebee's are [under 35]. The neighborhood drink promotions, it's 20-somethings that are going to that. And they're female, they're African-American, they're Hispanic.\n\nI think we've just hit on a formula, which is great because this will allow us to start having a more digital interaction with the customers. My kids have never paid a cable bill, ever. They like Hulu, they like Netflix, you know? But they don't watch commercial television. The good news is we think we're at least half of the social-media discussion in our categories, and that's partly because of our demographic, but I think it's also because we're doing fun, buzzworthy stuff.\n\nWe had a couple quick wins when people started gaining some confidence \u2014 they started to believe. You can tell there's an attitude that's different in the company if you visit the offices. People come in and go, \"This place is a different place than it was.\" Nobody liked where we were, but people didn't necessarily believe we could make a difference, and now they believe.\n\nBI: What was one of the first wins you guys had that you think helped move that?\n\nJoyce: There is no question, Dollarita. Dollarita turned everything around. It was a 13-point swing between September and October in Applebee's performance.\n\nIt was a risk. They pulled it together in a hurry. Franchisees were mixed on it, but we all agreed. When we sat down, we had the conversation, we said, \"Guys, we can keep doing what we're doing, and probably end up with the same result, or we can try something really different.\"\n\nThis was a franchisee's idea \u2014 it wasn't ours. A guy in Texas was doing it.\n\nYou worry about, do you attract the wrong element, do people come in and get soused, do they not order food? And none of that was what he was experiencing.\n\nWe experienced exactly what he did, maybe a little better. Ninety-eight percent of the people who came in and ordered those also ordered food. Most of the people would have one of those and then move upscale to another cocktail.\n\nBut it got buzz going. On social media initially, back in early October, people said, \"Well I don't like Applebee's, but dollar margaritas, I'm in!\" And people were upset, and I'm like: \"Get them in the restaurant, serve them well, give them great food and guess what? They'll come back.\" And that's what's happened.\n\nCasual dining isn't dead\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nBI: Now you can track how people are feeling on social media. For you guys, where people had maybe a more negative connotation, what do you pay attention to and what do you just completely ignore?\n\nJoyce: The biggest one is that casual and family dining are dead. It's simply not true. Well, it may be true for other brands, but it's not true for us.\n\nOur brands are generationally replicating each other. We see it in this research \u2014 grandparents take their grandkids, parents take their kids, when those kids grow up, they take their kids. And so the millennials we're getting are now starting to have children. Guess what? They're taking their kids to IHOP and Applebee's. It is a self-sustaining generational thing. We've got demographics that, I don't know everybody else's, but I guarantee ours are probably skewed much younger than anybody else's for major brands.\n\nSixty-five percent of the American public say when they're stressed, they want to eat food that comforts them. We make food that comforts people, OK?\n\nNinety percent of Americans say they've never been more stressed than today. So we are in a great position to help people. People say, you know: \"For an hour and a half, you guys are an oasis, because you accept me for who I am. I can be dressed any way I want, I can come from any walk of life, and you know what you do? You make me feel good.\"\n\nThe restaurants have never been better run. Never. The food has never been better, the service has never been better, and the team members in the restaurants are a lot happier, 'cause you know what? Restaurants are full, they're making money, and everybody's doing well.\n\nPeople say, \"Aren't you worried about the labor markets?\" Of course they're getting tighter. But our franchisees for the most part are more like family-run companies. They have long tenured employees. We believe we have lower turnover than the industry averages, and our folks are making more money.\n\nWages are going up. There's two sides to that: You know what they do? They go eat out.\n\nThe people that are going back to work don't have doctorate degrees. They're high school or less educated. Those are our customers, you know? Seventy-, $75,000-a-year household income, those people come by their money hard, and they want value.\n\nThat's why you see so many price-pointing things, because we want to remind people that not only are we great, but we're also affordable. You can come in with your family and have a great experience and get out without breaking the bank.\n\nBI: I think that the economic situation is super interesting because some of the fast-food guys I've talked to are definitely feeling the strain. Do you think that the current situation is good news for Applebee's and IHOP?\n\nJoyce: I think there are two things. Our franchisees, they're feeling labor pressure, pricing mostly. They recognize how it can benefit them, but more importantly, they're very optimistic because they're looking at higher profitability, not lower.\n\nOur product costs are probably going come down. I don't want to be the economist on this, but other people have said the tariffs are building up inventories. Inventory buildup means lower prices.\n\nSo we are telling our franchisees, we buy a couple billion dollars' worth of food every year. We are a significant player in the food industry. What it looks like is, our overall product mix \u2014 the cost of it is going to decline over the next year. That helps with margins.\n\nWe're doing all of these other things that are technology-related, that are taking cost either out of the back of the house or out of the front of the house and enhancing the customer experience. For example, Darren [Rebelez, IHOP president] has Rise and Shine 2.0 in several restaurants. A couple, two or three of them.\n\nWe're also playing around with the no-wait, which is big for IHOP on the weekends. We're going to do pay-at-the-table obviously, but we're going to also do pay-on-your-own-device. The other thing that we were testing in a couple places is, you can preorder on your phone, you can come in and set your phone on a little disc on the table, and it automatically drops the order to the kitchen.\n\nAt the same time, our guests are saying, \"We want to interact with the server.\" Well, guess what? Great news is, your server's never going to leave the floor, so he's going to be out in front of you every moment that you're there.\n\nEvery time we do something to remove a friction point for the customer, that guest gives us their data. So we get to know them better, and then we can figure out how best to talk with them and then what might interest them in terms of what we could do to increase their frequency. We're now talking about: What does our loyalty look like, and how do we take moderately frequent customers and turn them into more frequent customers? The battle cry at the IHOP convention was \"One more trip?\"\n\nMason: One more visit.\n\nJoyce: One more visit. One more visit. They had them chanting it by the end.\n\nIn my speech, I think I had it 12 times? The rallying cry for that effort was, they said, \"Look, this is all we need to do to get that one more visit.\" And by the way, one more visit from this set of moderately frequent customers will drop $150,000 into your bottom line. [Editor's note: A representative for Dine Brands later clarified this figure is actually $100,000.]\n\nThat's something franchisees can get excited about.\n\nNo one ever lost their love for the brands. But I think the appeal of the brands has not been stronger in a long time. And that's why you're seeing the numbers you're seeing.\n\nIHOb madness\n\nIHOP's pancake and burger, together on one plate. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nBI: As you've been able to collect more of this data, have there been any surprises?\n\nJoyce: You know, I think some of it was around the heart and the emotion of what the customers feel about, the passion around, the IHOP brand. You know we got death threats.\n\nBI: Oh my God, no!\n\nJoyce: I was like, \"I love that passion, send them a gift card!\" They're like, \"They didn't sign the death threat!\" And the good thing is they weren't able to make it so.\n\nBI: For IHOP specifically, what percentage of people going are these superfans who are going to send you death threats [for changing the name to IHOb], and then what percentage is an occasional guest?\n\nJoyce: Well, I think we only got one or two [death threats].\n\nI don't think we know the percentage, but just look at the dialogue. My kids texted me from Scandinavia, they're like: \"Dad, what are you doing? People are upset.\" And I'm like: \"We're just having fun. Relax! All will be revealed.\" They go, \"Well what is it?\" I go, \"I'm not telling you!\" And then you saw the celebrities get into the act.\n\nI think it just shows how much people love that brand, the level of interest and emotion around it. When they realized we were just having fun with it, then everybody had fun with it. [It] quadrupled burger sales, so we're still up, I think, over two times. Then lunch and dinner went up, which is exactly what we were trying to do, to remind people. One of the interesting things was that we taught a generation of kids who didn't know what the \"P\" stood for.\n\nBI: Over the last year, how has the IHOP identity changed?\n\nJoyce: They've broken away from this constant sweet, indulgent message. The burgers were a big breakaway, but we did omelets too. The advertising has gotten really edgy. You've seen it. We crashed a plane into an IHOP.\n\nMason: I think fun versus edgy.\n\nJoyce: Oh come on! Where would an advertising agency say, \"Yeah, you should crash a commercial airline into your restaurant?\" It's fun, but it's edgy. I like it.\n\nSome of the interesting things that have come out of the IHOP research is, for a 60-year-old brand, customers say, \"We think you're likely to do things that are out of the box, we think you're a risk taker.\"\n\nYou hear the franchisees say, \"This is the best team we've ever had.\" And then we just came out of the IHOP convention ... I don't know how many people came to me and said, \"This is the best convention we've ever been to.\"\n\nBI: What were some convention highlights?\n\nJoyce: Darren [Rebelez, IHOP's president] started out by telling the story about this Mexican barber who was named Carl. His real name was Carlos, but he changed his name to Carl because some people told him people won't go to a Mexican barber. So he built this huge business on word of mouth, people loved him, they took care of every customer. He had to move out of a shop into a third-floor office building, and his business still thrived. And when he tried to retire, people came to the kitchen in his house and he cut their hair there.\n\nSo then Darren goes away and talks about all the stuff that was going on at IHOP, and he goes back and says, \"And that was my grandfather.\" And I could feel like the hair on the back of my neck stand up. People were crying. It was awesome.\n\nMason: He's a crier!\n\nJoyce: My kids are so ashamed of me. But when you're able to get into the hearts and minds of your franchisees like Darren did, then they'll translate that into their team members, which then translates into the restaurants, and people feel it.\n\nMason: Yeah, there's a franchisee here in New Jersey. She's a refugee who moved here, got smart and invested in property. She basically knocked on doors and the mayor of the town, trying to open her first IHOP.\n\nShe's in her 20s, the youngest franchisee we ever had. She kept stalking corporate and saying, \"I should have this restaurant.\" Finally a woman said: \"You know what, hold on. I'm going to put you through.\" She got the Heart of IHOP Award this year. You look around that room and the diverse group of franchisees and where they come from \u2014 it's an extraordinary group.\n\nApplebee's turnaround\n\nApplebee's drinks deals helped turn around business. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nBI: Applebee's has gone through even more change over the last year. How do you think that image has changed?\n\nJoyce: Well, I think two things. I think the customer was confused as to what Applebee's was because they heard several different messages over time. And John and his team geared in immediately on \"Eatin' Good In The Neighborhood,\" local grill and bar. Bar, in particular.\n\nWe put hometown heroes on our wall. Applebee's used to do these really heart-tugging commercials and so [John Cywinski's] view is, we're going to get back to that piece.\n\nWe're the neighborhood bar and grill. That's why I think people were like, \"Well, why are your brands doing better than others?\" Because it's not a chain. It doesn't feel like a chain. When you're putting local heroes on your walls, and you're doing a great job of servicing people, and you're doing fun and interesting things, and you do the neighborhood-appreciation drink every month, you're part of the neighborhood.\n\nWe lost sight of the importance of that, and John brought it back full-steam. The results speak for themselves.\n\nMason: A couple years ago, it was like, \"I don't recognize you. This isn't that welcoming, comfortable place, my local Cheers bar.\" These guys, they have rallied.\n\nJoyce: And he's recaptured the trust of the franchisees.\n\nBI: How are the franchisees feeling now?\n\nJoyce: They are effusive. They're making money. So they were very concerned, and now they are raving fans, and so it's really fun to see. We have their convention this month.\n\nWe just did a smaller conference and the largest franchisee was there, and he just loves the brand. He was not in love with the brand two years ago. It's just a remarkable change, and now it's just a question of: OK, well, we found the right formula, but the formula, is it sustainable? Well I don't know, if you run really great restaurants, and you have really great food, and you innovate, and you make it buzzworthy, and you make it fun to be, and your team members in your restaurants are really happy, and they're providing great service, is that sustainable? Yes.\n\nThat's why people go out to eat, and then the added plus in this business is the carry-out and delivery.\n\nSeeking 20% delivery Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nBI: How much can you keep growing delivery? What's the limit?\n\nJoyce: There's the question. I think our sense is, let's break this down and think. Delivery and carry-out, I think John thinks he can get to 20%. And he's at 10-ish now, but he was at 10 when he was here the first time around because Applebee's owned takeout.\n\nMason: Curbside to-go.\n\nJoyce: They owned it, and then for whatever reason, they didn't de-emphasize it.\n\nYou've got some brands that have really done a good job and are in the mid-teens. So our sense is that it could be 20%. And IHOP probably close, but maybe a little less, maybe 15%.\n\nWhen you go to order breakfast, there's not many delivery services. Most restaurants people deliver from aren't open. IHOP has the unique ability because we're the only brand out there with the inventory we've got that serves great breakfast.\n\nThen, there's other things that we're looking at on both sides. We think catering could be big business, and it's sort of an extension of carry-out or delivery.\n\nAt IHOP, we're underrepresented in both brands in major urban centers. We have programs that we talked to the franchisees about, and particularly on the IHOP side, they're very interested in doing, which is a different version of IHOP. It can vary a little bit, but it's more of a carry-out. You can dine in, but it's more of a fast-casual kind of approach to it. And so I think you'll see some of those starting sometime next year.\n\nMason: We just opened in Panama, and the results have been pretty phenomenal. So, learning more about that.\n\nJoyce: [The franchisee] opened one, now he's going to do four more.\n\nBI: What have been the findings from that?\n\nJoyce: The menu is less than the full menu, so we spent a lot of time on consumer research as to what should be on it. The application to the US is a combination of ... you need to make sure that you do the research around it, but you've gotta make sure people understand what it is. We did a good job of that in Panama. They had lines out the door the first week. I think when we do the first couple of urban projects here, we'll do a lot of fanfare around it so people understand what it is, and it'll probably be named differently. Internationally we call it \u2014\n\nMason: Fresh and go.\n\nJoyce: But, we've gotta be careful not to have people thinking, \"Oh, I'm going to sit down and get served.\" People love the food. That would allow us to get a lot more presence in urban markets where people want the food, they just haven't figured out a format that worked.\n\nLeadership and funerals\n\nBI: When you started in this position, what did you want to bring to the role as a leader in transforming the culture?\n\nJoyce: I wasn't a restaurateur coming in, so clearly I wasn't going to come in and dictate restaurant strategy. What I wanted to do is attract the best talent we could with the broadest set of experiences of people who had been to the wars and back.\n\nBut the bigger thing for me is establishing a culture where people feel bonded to it and feel engaged. I think from the very beginning, my focus was on the people and trying to create an attitude within the company of \"We're saying we're here for you, but we're going to be there.\"\n\nI go to more funerals than anybody I know. You know why I go to people's funerals? Because it's important. I know how I thought about people when they didn't show up for my parents' funerals. People that said they loved me and they'd do anything for me. All right, really? You didn't show up for my mother's funeral? So I remember how that felt.\n\nThat's one example of what I'm trying to instill in the leaders \u2014 if these are our values and this is our culture, then you've gotta live it every day. It's gotta be part of the way we work with each other.\n\nIf you look in the last year, our youngest managers only got two weeks vacation. Now they're going to get three. We had a lousy maternity-paternity parental-leave policy. We now have an industry lead. We've specialized in preventative care on our health insurance, and we've paid for almost everything preventative. And we've had two years of no cost increases.\n\nWe changed the workweek. We said, \"Look, if you want to work an extra half hour a day and take Friday afternoon off, we're going to let you do that.\" Because the thing that screamed at us through the survey was, \"I don't feel like my life is balanced, I don't feel like I have control over my family obligations and work at the same time.\" So we've just done a series of things that I think people noticed, and they sensed that something was different.\n\nBI: What have reactions been like?\n\nMason: He's being very humble. Steve did come in with the people first, and one of the first things he implemented was a regular engagement survey. He said, I need to know how people are doing on a regular basis, so we're actually just pulsing it.\n\nHe brought us to this century in terms of how we're operating, what it means to truly be engaged, what it truly means to care. I've worked with people who say if you give an inch, they're going to take a mile. He's the the CEO I've always dreamt of. He's got a big heart, supersmart about business, knows how to connect the two, but coming in and saying: \"I want to understand you, I'm going to set a clear vision, I'm going to listen to you. I care, everybody in the organization has a say, and I'm going to create the forum and the environment to do that.\"\n\nBI: How do you find other people who are like that when you're trying to hire for this culture?\n\nJoyce: Because they're attracted to the culture, our employment brand has changed dramatically.\n\nWhen we talk to people, they're like, \"You guys are doing something different over there.\" And so, so we're getting a higher caliber of recruit.\n\nWe've got a good story to tell. Everybody wants to be part of something different, right? They don't want to be part of some elaborate corporate empire that doesn't feel or bleed or breathe. Everybody wants to be a part, and they want to feel like they've got a role.\n\nThe search for new brands\n\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nBI: How do you keep expanding this type of leadership?\n\nJoyce: It's constantly challenging the extended leadership team, asking: \"Are we doing enough? What are your people saying?\"\n\nNot only if you want them to do more, they've gotta personally profit from it. For some reason, that's gotten to be a bad word, and I'm like, no. If you guys contribute to a greater success, you should make more money for your family. I don't know why that's not OK to say.\n\nPart of the reason I want to buy brands is because the more I grow this company, the more money you're going to make and the more opportunity you're going to have. You want to be part of a growth company \u2014 you don't want to be a part of a company that's stagnating.\n\nWe were on the phone with one of the analysts, and after the call he was like, \"You know, a lot of people are upset about you potentially buying another brand.\" And I'm like, \"Well let me tell you how we're going to do it.\" He goes, \"Well if you did all that, I guess it'd be OK.\"\n\nPlus, it changes the nature of the company. Companies that are stagnating, it's really hard to keep things moving, so part of it is the momentum building. People would say, \"Wow you had a great year.\" My view is we're just getting started. The brands that we have still have enormous potential in lots of markets and lots of different places. There's a lot of opportunity for upside within the brands themselves.\n\nBut then, because we've got a strong balance sheet, we can start looking at bringing some other brands in. Let's look at adjacent businesses. Why aren't we buying into X business if we're buying that from somebody anyway? The franchisees benefit, and could we benefit at the same time?\n\nTechnology is big investment. We're just starting on the technology venture. We're having some serious conversations with franchisees about getting to where Domino's is. That costs money, and how are we going to pay for it? And so we're having that dialogue back and forth.\n\nWhen people are challenged with things that they don't think can be done, and then they start doing them, it starts building on itself. Somebody asked me, \"What's your advice about telling young people about where to go to work?\" I say, \"Go to a place that's growing fast.\" They'll have you do a bunch of things you shouldn't be able to do and you're probably not qualified for, but that's where you're going to learn the most, and that's where you're going to have the most fun.\n\nDon't go to places growing 6% a year, where people have to die for you to move up. That's not fun. I think in this scenario we've got the opportunity not only have significant growth in existing brands but to begin adding brands.\n\nBI: So tell me your filters. What are you looking for?\n\nJoyce: It's gotta be mass appeal. We've gotta be able to take it to a thousand units. It's gotta meet, I think, trending attitudes of the American public that are long-term. For example, right now, healthy looks like a continuing trend. We're looking at a lot of different brands, whether it be Mediterranean, whether it be salads, whether it be different types of cuisines that are healthier and provide mass appeal.\n\nWe need the right team to come with it. We don't want to start from scratch \u2014 we want 75 or 100 units. And we want to have the franchisees tell us, \"If you buy this brand, we'll do these units.\" Those are the primary filters. Then we'll get down to what's the deal, what's the cost, what do we think their ROI is?\n\nThe easy thing would be to say: \"Well look, our stock's really undervalued. Let's just buy a bunch of stock.\" That's not the company I want to work in. And that's not the company anyone else wants to work in. We all want for shareholders to get huge returns, which they're getting. But at the same time, that return should grow every year. You're not going to do that by just buying back your stock. You've got to reinvest in your brands \u2014 you've got to reinvest in growth.\n\nWhen I started at Choice [Hotels, where Joyce was CEO from 2008 to 2017], I had nine brands. When I left, there were 13. When I started, they were less than 5,000 hotels. When I left, there were over 7,000. That's pretty fun. And, we can do the same thing here.\n\nBI: Thinking about just trends in general, what excites you?\n\nJoyce: Growth.\n\nI see how my dietary habits have changed over the years. I'm not the core customer, but I'm not that unusual either. I still love going and eating fish and chips. And so, I love the food at Applebee's, and I love the food at IHOP. But I also try to eat cleaner. In both places we have options.\n\nI'm a boomer, but my kids and I like the same things. I think Americans are going to begin eating healthier.\n\nCasual dining is a big segment. Family dining is a big segment. Fast-casual is teeny. We all spend all our time talking about it, but it's not the restaurant business. But if you can land into that and turn that into a major category ...\n\nPizza and burgers are big. They're so competitive, and we have so many good options out there. It's not like we wouldn't do it if we found the right thing. I think I want to go someplace that is more different. I'm not going to go if it's not mass appeal. If we can't get to a thousand units, it doesn't do us any good. So it's gotta kinda hit both targets.", "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An EU army is likely to be formed one day, the European Commission said on Tuesday after French President Emmanuel Macron called for a \"real European army\" to reduce dependence on the United States.\n\nCommission President Jean-Claude Juncker, a former premier of Luxembourg, has long been a vocal supporter of the idea that the European Union should have more common defense capability, separate from the US-dominated NATO military alliance.\n\nThe imminent departure from the bloc of Britain, long opposed to EU military collaboration, has revived discussion of defense cooperation \u2014 as have concerns that President Donald Trump may be less willing than his predecessors to come to Europe's defense in the face of a newly assertive Russia.\n\nSome EU leaders share Britain's view that giving the EU a big military role could undermine NATO. Traditionally neutral, non-NATO countries in the Union are also wary.

The option is currently available by invitation only and allows customers to select a specific day of the week for their Amazon orders to arrive.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nDuring future purchases, users will be able to select delivery specifically for that day, with orders arriving in as few shipments as possible. Prime members using the service can still select other options, such as one- or two-day shipping, if they choose, and they're not locked in to only receiving packages on their Amazon Day. Items can be added to Amazon Day orders up to 48 hours before the day arrives.\n\nAmazon Day adds to Prime's ever increasing value by making the e-tailer more flexible for its members. The ability to schedule delivery for free may make a big difference for busy Prime members who work during the week and can't accept shipments at home on weekdays.\n\nGetting all their orders for the week on the same day \u2014 like on Saturday when they can be home \u2014 can help these customers worry less about having packages stolen from their doorsteps or having to deal with the complication of a failed delivery. Frequent Amazon users can also avoid the nuisance of getting multiple packages each week.\n\nThis new feature may help Amazon become a greater part of its Prime members' routines. With the ability to select a day that works best for them, customers may come to anticipate the reliability of getting a shipment from Amazon each week.\n\nThis reliability may also help Amazon nudge Prime members toward making more impulse purchases. For example, the e-tailer could send an email containing personalized product recommendations to customers shortly before the deadline to add items to their Amazon Day order. The simplicity of adding an item to their Amazon Day shipment and knowing that it will arrive on the scheduled day along with all the other orders of the week may spur Prime members to make an additional purchase.\n\nThe program also carries benefits on the shipping side for Amazon. If Amazon Day proves popular, it will mean that, in many cases, the e-tailer will have more time to prepare orders, as customers will place some orders more than two days before their delivery day. Additionally, Amazon will be able to cluster orders into as few packages as possible, helping it shrink shipping costs by reducing the number of extraneous shipments it has to send out.", "Career motivation can come from anywhere \u2014 even a motivational poster taped on company walls.\n\nFacebook's headquarters are known to display motivational posters.

A car insurance premium is the rate an owner pays to activate an insurance policy which protects them against accidents, damages, stolen vehicles and other incidents. Like many aspects of America, car insurance rates very from state to state.\n\nThe insurance information website Insure.com recently published an analysis on which states have the highest and lowest annual insurance rates, including a total ranking of all 50 states. According to the study, the national average for annual premiums is $1,365, but the variance among states is more stark than one would assume.\n\nWhen looking at the example of a specific, best-selling vehicle, the Nissan Rogue, Insure.com Consumer Analyst Penny Gusner said in a public statement, \"Insuring a 2018 Nissan Rogue in Michigan costs, on average, $2,372. In Vermont, the average rate for the best-selling SUV is just $918. This is a difference of $1,454, or breaks down that you'll pay 158 percent more to insure the same vehicle in Michigan than in Vermont.\"\n\nRead More: The 11 new cars people most regularly ditch after just one year of ownership\n\nThere's a reason for the huge premium disparity for the same vehicle.\n\nInsure.com points out that Michigan uses \"no-fault\" car insurance that is believed to be the cause of driving up rates because this type of insurance un-caps medical benefits for injuries sustained while driving.\n\nWhen looking at the states that have low insurance rates, there are other factors at play that make for a lower number.\n\nVermont has a small population, so this leads to less accidents and fewer claims, both which help drive down premiums. This is the reason why Idaho and Iowa are both top-5 for least-expensive insurance.\n\nOhio and Virginia are each relatively highly-populated states that have low insurance rates, but Insure.com cites the vast number of insurance carriers in each state\u2014almost 250 for Ohio and over 300 for Virginia\u2014and the competition which results as the main reason their insurance premiums are so low.\n\nVariance in state laws account for the changes among auto premiums, but weather differences, crime rates, and the percentage of uninsured drivers in each state all play into the creating differences in premium numbers.\n\nInsure.com' study notes that there are multiple risk factors at play that affect car insurance no matter the state that include age of drivers and gender, as older drivers have fewer accidents and females have less; location, as some states have more roads than others; the type of car one drives, because a minivan costs less to insure than a Ferrari; and driving record of the vehicle owner.\n\nWith this information in mind, take a look below the five states with the highest annual average insurance premiums and the five states with the lowest using data provided by Insure.com.", "CHARLESTON, West Virginia \u2014 Minutes after securing reelection Tuesday night, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin took a harsher tone against President Donald Trump, blasting him for the failure of his Republican challenger, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, an ardent White House ally.\n\nManchin barbed the president for not being able to get Morrisey over the finish line despite the state having voted for Trump by a margin of more than 40 points in 2016.\n\n\"Let me say that I never expected that this race would be the national race it turned out to be,\" Manchin said in his victory speech. \"I never expected President Trump to come to this state as much as he did, sending Vice President Pence, sending his family, time after time. And you stood tall.\n\n\"What you said, what West Virginia said, loud and clear tonight: 'Mr. President, we want our senator, not your senator,'\" Manchin added.\n\nRead more: Republicans projected to hold on to majority control of the Senate\n\nThe incumbent Democrat also condemned \"toxic rhetoric\" and demanded Trump play a more unifying role.\n\n\"When I raise my hand and swear to God to uphold the Constitution, that's for everybody. That is for everybody. And we've got to stop this absolute toxic rhetoric that's going on in this country \u2014 we have got to stop this toxic rhetoric,\" he said. \"We've got to bring people together. Mr. President, I want you to be a president of the United States, not the divided states.\"\n\nAfter his speech, Manchin told Business Insider that \"no one's ever won in a state where the president had a 42-point spread,\" repeating his claim that voters rejected Trump's choice of candidate.\n\nBut Manchin said he was not worried that his harsher tone against Trump would upset the president, who often lashes out at critics and those who downplay his status as a GOP kingmaker.\n\n\"I'm not angry because he came here so many times,\" Manchin said of Trump's repeated visits to West Virginia to stump for Morrisey. \"Why should he be angry that I'm telling the truth? I don't think so.\"\n\nManchin had previously railed against Vice President Mike Pence for coming to West Virginia, describing him as a \"junkyard dog\" doing Trump's bidding.\n\n\"I know Mike Pence, and he's just, I guess, doing his job,\" Manchin said. \"He's a junkyard dog right now, I guess. He has to go out and do it.\"\n\nManchin was the only Democrat to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee prompted additional hearings and nearly split the vote in the Senate.\n\nIn contrast, Morrisey ran on the premise that he would be Trump's greatest ally in the Senate, even labeling the final leg of his campaign tour the \"Stand with Trump Tour.\"\n\n\"Everyone who follows the race knows I'm the conservative fire who's going to advance the Trump jobs agenda and Joe Manchin's a dishonest Washington liberal who's going to empower the 'impeach, obstruct, and resist' circus in DC,\" Morrisey told Business Insider in an October interview in Parkersburg, West Virginia.\n\nTrump campaigned for Morrisey days before the election at a large rally in Huntington, while his son Donald Trump Jr. stumped for the Republican several times in the final weeks of the cycle.\n\nBut, as Manchin said, it was simply not enough.", "Facebook is delaying the launch of a tool showing who is behind political ads in the UK after news outlets, including Business Insider, exposed the system's flaws.\n\nThe company was meant to launch its new ad transparency tool on November 7, but told The Guardian that it would now be rolled out \"in the next month.\"\n\nIn a statement sent to Business Insider, it said:\n\n\"Since we announced our political ads authorisation and Ad Library in October we have seen hundreds of people go through the authorisation process.

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\n\nForto\n\nYou don't have to sip your way through a Venti Americano just to get through your morning. Nor do you have to chug a Red Bull at 8 a.m. in order to face down your day. Instead, you can combine the two concepts and down a Forto, which gives you your daily dose of caffeine but in an approachable, ready to drink two-ounce serving.\n\nForto's organic cold brew coffee has slowly been making its way into caffeine-seekers' homes throughout the year, but with its new partnership with four well-known brands in the coffee space, it's likely that you'll be seeing a whole lot more of these coffee shots in the weeks and months to come. At the beginning of November, the company partnered with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters and The Original Donut Shot in order to bring the flavors that you've come to know and love into a more easily consumable form.\n\nAll of these new coffee shots incorporate the same flavor associated with each brand, but in a 2-ounce plastic container instead of a 12-ounce paper cup. In total, there are three new flavors available across the two partnerships, but they all share one very important characteristic in common \u2014 each of these shots contains 100mg of caffeine, which is to say, the equivalent of one cup of coffee.\n\nFor the coffee purists who would prefer their coffee without any sweeteners or dilutions, my recommendation would certainly be the Green Mountain Pure Black coffee shot. I found the coffee flavor to be compounded by the small volume, but it's not so strong that you'll feel ill after downing the shot. Alternatively, there's the gentler Donut Shop Sweet & Creamy Latte, which tastes more like a milkshake (in a good way) than a caffeine boost, and the Green Mountain Mocha, which integrates just the right amount of chocolate into the beverage to make it worth your while.\n\nForto\n\nLater on in the year, Forto will also be capitalizing upon partnerships with Krispy Kreme and Gevalia, which I can only hope will mean an even wider range of flavors and fixes.\n\nPerhaps my favorite thing about these Forto coffee shots is how delightfully portable they are.\n\nThrow them in your bag at the beginning of the day, and thanks to their leak-proof seal and TSA-approved size, these guys can go literally anywhere you go. When you've taken your shot, simply recycle the bottle.\n\nWhile I was certainly skeptical about the amount of energy I'd be able to derive from a mere two ounces of caffeine, I've never been so pleased to be proven wrong. Not only does Forto reduce the amount of coffee breath that I (and more saliently, my coworkers) have to put up with, but these shots also make it such that I have to spend much less time getting my caffeine fix. And if the whole point of caffeinating is to maximize efficiency, then it seems that Forto is truly the pinnacle of productivity.\n\nIf you're looking for even more caffeine out of your shots, Forto also offers 200mg versions of its products, all of which come in slightly sweeter flavors \u2014 there's Vanilla Latte, Chocolate Latte, and Sweetened Black.\n\nNo matter which flavor you choose, you'll be paying $11.95 for a box of six, which comes out to just under $2 per shot. And let's be honest \u2014 if nothing else, that's a better price than you're currently paying for your morning cup of joe.", "Thomson Reuters\n\nStocks rose Wednesday after the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nDemocrats captured control of the House while Republicans expanded their Senate majority.\n\nFollow US stocks in real time here.\n\nStocks rallied Wednesday following the 2018 midterm elections that shifted the balance of power in Washington, with Wall Street preparing for the possibility of legislative obstacles within a divided Congress.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 2.12%, or more than 500 points, and the Nasdaq Composite surged 2.64%.

CVS expects its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna to close before Thanksgiving.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThe retail pharmacy company will pilot a range of programs at the concept stores to determine which are most effective before scaling the initiative across its 10,000 stores and 1,100 MinuteClinics.\n\nThe new services revolve around reducing healthcare costs for Aetna's most expensive members. The concept stores will focus on managing chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma, and behavioral health. With Aetna members soon moving under its umbrella, CVS has a greater financial incentive to improve the treatment of chronic diseases, which account for 90% of the $3.3 trillion the US spends on healthcare annually.\n\nPatients with three to four chronic diseases cost private insurers more than five times as much annually as those with none, according to a 2017 RAND study. CVS didn't provide specifics on the new chronic disease programs, but we expect telehealth will play a central role. CVS introduced 24/7 access to doctors using telemedicine via its mobile app in August.\n\nAnd when CVS and Aetna first announced their mega-merger in December 2017, Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini discussed distributing Bluetooth-connected glucose monitors that allow virtual providers to alert CVS patients when their glucose levels are off.\n\nCVS' deeper dive into healthcare services should also put hospitals and health systems on high alert:", "Plaid is quickly making a name for itself as one of the hottest fintech startups around.\n\nThe company, which provides online verification services for financial institutions like banks and stock-trading firms, is trying to raise several hundred million dollars at a valuation of $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\nAs of October, Plaid told investors it was on track to generate about $70 million over the next 12 months, two people who were briefed on the financials tell Business Insider.\n\nThat's up from the $50 million in revenue the company told investors just one month earlier it was on track to generate, two other people who reviewed Plaid's financials at the time said.\n\nWith $70 million in projected revenue over the next 12 months, Plaid is seeking to value itself at about 43 times what is known as its annual run rate.\n\nIt also means Plaid has tripled its private valuation in less than six months, as Forbes reported in April that the company was valued at $1 billion.\n\nFor comparison, the fintech startup Yodlee, which is considered one of Plaid's top competitors, was acquired by Envestnet in 2015 for just under $600 million.

Universal Standard\n\nThe most comfortable clothes I own are also the most inclusive, and if I weren't so taken with the material used by Universal Standard's incredible line of basics, then I would've been won over by their forward-thinking approach to fashion.\n\nFor the last three years, the brand has been creating modern takes on classic essentials for women of all sizes, and now, Universal Standard has launched its first fully size inclusive line of elevated basics to serve women of truly all shapes and sizes. With the Foundation Collection, not only will you be able to find a size that fits you, you'll find a size that makes you feel fabulous.\n\nWith sizes ranging from 00 to 40, the Foundation Collection (and Universal Standard as a whole) wants nothing to do with the notion of plus sizes or extra smalls or larges. Instead, the brand has created a capsule collection that is just as appealing to one body type as it is to another. And most importantly, just as comfortable.\n\nAs someone who often attempts to leave the house in an outfit as close to pajamas as possible, I've found that the Foundation Collection has truly allowed me to live my best, laziest life. All of the pieces in this collection are constructed with a ribbed jersey, which hugs your curves in a flattering fashion.\n\nShop the Universal Standard Foundation Collection 7-piece kit, $180. Universal Standard\n\nThe Collection is comprises seven items \u2014 a bandeau, a camisole, both a short sleeve and a long sleeve V-neck and crew neck, and my personal favorite, a turtleneck. The long-sleeved items are warm enough to be worn alone during the fall (or late spring) but versatile enough to be layered atop or beneath other pieces as the weather turns colder. The turtleneck I find particularly charming because it's not at all constricting. I've worn my fair share of turtlenecks that would as soon choke me as keep my neck warm, which makes the Foundation Collection's take on this staple all the more appealing. Not only does the collar drape in an extremely flattering fashion, but it's also remarkably cozy and soft. The short sleeve shirts and cami, on the other hand, are breathable without being baggy \u2014 ideal for the summer.\n\nAll pieces are available in a standard white, black, and an elegant grey that tends toward the lighter end of the spectrum, but goes well with just about any other color.\n\nNot only was I impressed by the construction of each piece, but I was also pleasantly surprised by the fit. Given the wide range of sizes, I wasn't quite sure how Universal Standard would ensure that a size 00 fit just as well as a size 40. The secret, I surmise, comes in the way that the jersey forms to your body. It doesn't cling in a too-tight way, but it also doesn't fall shaplessly along your side. Instead, it forms well to the shape of your body, smoothing everything out in between, and helping you both look and feel your best.\n\nThe Foundation Collection is available as both a four-piece ($120) and seven-piece kit ($180), and you can mix and match both the colors and the sizes within each kit.", "The United States is home to more millionaires than any other country in the world. But whether the country is truly the wealthiest in the world depends on how you measure.\n\nA report released by Credit Suisse in October says the US is \"in the lead\" when it comes to global wealth. But a closer look at the numbers in that report reveals a different story.\n\nWhile it's true that wealth in the US is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, it's not the richest when you compare the average amount of wealth per adult.\n\nThat prize goes to Switzerland, as you can see in the map below.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nWait a minute, you may be thinking: it looks like the US is richer than Canada. So what's with the headline?\n\nThe ranking above divides a country's overall wealth by the total population. That means it doesn't reflect the fact that the top 0.1% of US households hold as much wealth as the bottom 90%.\n\n\"The United States has the most members of the top 1% global wealth group, and currently accounts for 41% of the world's millionaires,\" the report notes. \"Our research indicates that the United States added 878,000 new millionaires [since 2017] \u2014 representing around 40% of the global increase.\"\n\nA different, perhaps fairer, way to rank the richest countries in the world is to take a look at the countries where the greatest number of people are rich.\n\nCredit Suisse ran those numbers, too, in order to compare how much wealth the median, middle-of-the-pack person has in every country.\n\nIn that ranking, Australians are the richest. And the US doesn't even make the top 10.\n\nShayanne Gal/Business Insider\n\nThe US has a median wealth of $61,667 per adult, which puts the country at number 18, well behind others, including Ireland ($72,473), Taiwan ($78,177), and Korea ($65,463). Canada, on the other hand, comes in at number six, with an average wealth of $106,342 per adult.\n\nEconomists often point out the simple truth that having wealth makes it easier to get more wealth, which means those who have a lot of money pass on an advantage from one generation to the next.\n\nTo adjust for that, economist Darrick Hamilton, a professor at The New School, recently proposed a kind of baby trust fund system. His idea is to give all kids in the US a chunk of cash when they're born, ranging between $500 and $60,000 based on their family's wealth. That would help give all American kids a fair shot at a prosperous future, he said.\n\nRead more: An economist has a wild proposal to give all kids in the US up to $60,000 at birth\n\n\"Wealth is the paramount indicator of economic security and well-being,\" Hamilton told a crowd at the TED Conferences headquarters in New York in September. \"It is time to get beyond the false narrative that attributes inequalities to individual personal deficits while largely ignoring the advantages of wealth.\"", "This story was delivered to Business Insider Intelligence \"Payments Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

It's one of the coldest places on Earth due to its high elevation and location on the Antarctic plateau. The area is so cold, in fact, that precipitation falls to the surface as ice crystals.\n\nThe temperature can drop as low as -112 degrees Fahrenheit (-80 degrees Celsius). It can get warmer, relatively speaking, but only to the tune of -22 degrees Fahrenheit (-30 degrees Celsius).", "The 2018 midterm elections are in the books, and the outcome was one that most experts expected: The Democrats reclaimed the House of Representatives, and the Republicans kept control of the Senate.\n\nIt's a definite win \u2014 and a redemption of sorts \u2014 for prognosticators who were caught flat-footed by Donald Trump's electoral victory and the Brexit vote. But it's a tricky situation for traders who make their living finding unrealized wrinkles in the market.\n\nWithout the types of sharp moves that accompany an unforeseen outcome, markets can be, for lack of a better word, boring. Sure, stocks are surging, but everyone thought that would happen. It's only by finding overlooked opportunities that a trade can truly make a killing in such a market.\n\nLuckily, Dennis DeBusschere, the head of portfolio strategy at Evercore ISI, who has a two-part trade he says is going underappreciated.\n\nThe first part involves going long machinery. According to Evercore, the market isn't yet factoring in the positive developments for the industry that should stem from the election results.\n\nWith a split Congress, Evercore says additional stimulus is unlikely to occur, which will result in slower economic growth and more constrained US Treasury yields. The firm says the market is overlooking what those factors could mean for trade and the Federal Reserve's future tightening plans as they pertain to capital goods. They should be a positive.\n\nThe chart below shows how much dormant upside exists in the capital goods/machinery space.\n\n\"Capital goods has lower macro risk relative to a few weeks ago,\" DeBusschere wrote in a client note on Wednesday. \"That decline suggests the macro backdrop was not a driver of the recent risk-off event, and that there is room for improved performance as the worst fears surrounding peak growth subside.\"\n\nEvercore ISI\n\nThe second part of DeBusschere's trade is going short utilities. The sector, which has traditionally been a defensive option for investors, was resilient during the stock market's so-called Red October, so it's already in a vulnerable place as risk appetite seeps back into the market.\n\nWhen you combine that with a likely easing of financial conditions \u2014 since stocks are rising, expected price swings are falling, and bond spreads have stabilized \u2014 it's bad news for the utilities sector.\n\nThe chart below shows the extent to which utilities have historically tracked financial conditions. It suggests that as conditions ease, utilities will slip.\n\nEvercore ISI\n\nOf course, the most straightforward way to play the midterm election outcome is to simply go long stocks. The market was crushed in October, and most experts expect a reversion to the mean. The expected outcome was confirmed, which should remove uncertainty (and volatility) from equities.\n\nBut where's the fun in making the same trade as everyone else? That's why DeBusschere's recommendation is so enticing.", "Ready or not, here Amazon comes.\n\nThe company is close to choosing Long Island City as one of the spots where it will place its HQ2 project, along with Arlington, Virginia, The New York Times reported on Monday evening. Part of the New York City borough of Queens, directly across the East River from Manhattan, Long Island City is a neighborhood in transition.\n\nOnce industrial, the neighborhood is now full of tall, glassy condo towers and attractive restaurants. Forty-one new apartment buildings have been built in the neighborhood since 2010, according to the city.\n\nIt's still a neighborhood in transition, however, and some areas remain undeveloped. That's most likely where Amazon plans to step in.\n\nRead more: Amazon is said to be breaking a central promise of HQ2 by placing it in 2 different cities\n\nBut, as with any area, Long Island City has its issues, many of them growing pains. All those new people moving in are straining the area's transportation, schools, and even sewer system.\n\nThat's according to an investment strategy that New York City released this year identifying ways to remedy those three issues.\n\nOver the past several years, New York has set aside $46 million for sewer and water-main upgrades in Long Island City. Dramatic improvements are being proposed or are already in the works, including $60 million for a new school and a new station stop off the Long Island Rail Road, which runs through the neighborhood on its way to Penn Station.

Now, the company is expanding its mortgage offerings with products that mark an entry into the buy-to-let mortgage market. Buy-to-let mortgages are loans specifically for those who want to buy property to rent it out.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nAtom has initially introduced 2- and 5-year buy-to-let remortgage products for landlords that have four to 25 properties. Users will have to pay a 1% loan fee, and the maximum loan term is 25 years.\n\nFor now, it is testing the products in an exclusive pilot, which will allow it to make improvements before committing to a full roll out. In the future, it also wants to offer fixed-rate products and other solutions.\n\nAtom has also partnered with Newcastle University in the UK to help it gauge consumer trust in technology and build better products, including mortgages. The two parties are working together on a project called FinTrust, which has been funded by a \u00a31.2 million ($1.57 million) grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.\n\nOne of the first applications of the research will be developing a blockchain to build better mortgages, a project that will draw on blockchain expertise from Newcastle University's Computer Science department and crypto-statisticians at the Durham University's Department of Mathematical Sciences, according to Edward Twiddy, chief innovation officer at Atom Bank, cited by Finextra. As such, with time, we will likely see Atom rolling out even more mortgage products.\n\nEnsuring that it is building suitable products will likely help Atom to remain successful. Only 9% of consumers would use a mobile app to apply for a mortgage, compared with 29% who would visit a branch to do so. As such, it seems that consumers don't trust technology to handle such high-value financial services yet.\n\nAtom is wise to look into how it can build more credible solutions in the future, which will help it to compete against other neobanks and incumbents operating in the country.", "It's easy to earn credit card rewards points and frequent flyer miles on your everyday spending.\n\nEspecially in 2018, as credit card issuers introduce increasingly rewarding products in order to compete with each other, all you need to do is use a card for your normal spending \u2014 and pay it off in full each month \u2014 and you can earn tons of bonus points in categories like grocery stores, dining, and travel.\n\nHowever, the fastest and easiest way to earn a lot of points quickly \u2014 whether you're planning a big trip but don't have enough points yet, or you're just looking to build up your stash \u2014 is to open a new credit card that offers a lucrative welcome bonus.\n\nCredit card issuers offer huge bonuses to attract customers, and while each card may have different eligibility requirements, in most cases you can get the bonus as long as you haven't had that card before \u2014 or, in some cases, as long as you haven't had it in the past few years.\n\nWith brand new, limited time offers available, along with reliable standbys, November is turning out to be a great month for the world of credit card rewards.\n\nYou can read more about earning new card member bonuses and how that will affect your credit score here, or scroll down to find some of the best offers available this month.\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nSign-up bonus: 75,000 miles (after spending $5,000 in the first three months). For a limited time only.\n\nThe Capital One Venture has historically been a useful card, thanks to a solid earning rate of 2x miles on everything, even though the rewards program was just...fine. Unlike cards offered by competitors, miles had a fixed value of 1\u00a2 each toward travel purchases. Generally, transferable credit card points\u2014 those that you can transfer to an airline frequent flyer program, should you choose \u2014 are more valuable, thanks to the way that booking frequent flyer award tickets works. You can read more about that here.\n\nHowever, Capital One has announced that starting in December 2018, Venture cardholders will be able to transfer miles to 12 new airline partners, significantly increasing the potential value of each mile.\n\nAdditionally, Capital One announced a new, limited-time sign-up bonus of 75,000 miles when you spend $5,000 in the first three months. That's worth at least $750 toward travel if you choose to redeem against a travel purchase, and potentially much more when you transfer to an airline frequent flyer program.\n\nBetween the ability to transfer miles to airlines, and the limited-time sign-up bonus, this is one of the best cards available right now.\n\nThe Capital One Venture earns miles at a rate of 2x per dollar spent on all purchases, and an incredible 10x points per dollar spent on hotel stays when you book and pay through Hotels.com/Venture. Hotels.com has its own loyalty program that rewards you with a free night after 10 paid nights, so that equates to a staggering 20% return on hotels.\n\nThe card also offers a credit to enroll in TSA PreCheck or Global Entry. It has a $95 annual fee, which is waived the first year.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Capital One Venture from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nSign-up bonus: Up to 200,000 miles (50,000 miles after spending $5,000 in the first three months, and an additional 150,000 miles after spending $50,000 in the first six months). For a limited time only.\n\nLike the Venture, the Capital One Spark Miles is gaining the ability to transfer miles to 12 airline frequent flyer partners. Also like the Venture, the Spark Miles is offering a limited-time sign-up bonus to mark the change.\n\nOf course, the spending requirement to earn the full bonus \u2014 $50,000 in the first six months \u2014 is high, but it's definitely achievable for plenty of small- and medium-sized businesses \u2014 particularly those that lay out for materials, equipment, or services on behalf of a client.\n\nThe Spark Miles is fairly similar to the Venture, aside from the fact that it's a business card rather than a personal one. It earns 2x miles on all purchases, with no limits, and has a $95 annual fee that's waived the first year.\n\nIt was already a solid card; with the ability to transfer miles to airline partners, plus the massive sign-up bonus, the Spark Miles becomes a major player.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Capital One Spark Miles from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nWelcome offer: 25,000 Membership Rewards points (after spending $2,000 in the first three months). Until January 9: Get up 20% back at US restaurants within the first three months, up to $100 total.\n\nLast month, American Express launched a massive reboot of its Premier Rewards Gold card, rebranding it as the American Express Gold Card, releasing a new metal design and limited-edition rose gold version, and totally overhauling the rewards and benefits on the card. Because that wasn't quite enough, AmEx also introduced a fairly unique new welcome bonus.\n\nThe new Gold Card earns 4x points at US restaurants and on up to $25,000 per year at US supermarkets (and 1x after that), 3x points on flights booked directly with the airline, and 1x point on everything else.\n\nBased on the fact that you can easily redeem Membership Rewards points for more than 1\u00a2 of value each, that makes this the highest-earning card for everything food-related.\n\nThe Gold Card keeps the old card's $100 airline fee credit each calendar year, and adds up to $120 of dining credits \u2014 split into $10 each month \u2014 at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth's Steak House, or participating Shake Shack locations. If you use those credits in full, that's a guaranteed $220 of value each year.\n\nNew card members \u2014 those who haven't previously had the Premier Rewards Gold \u2014 can earn a welcome bonus of 25,000 points when they spend $2,000 in the first three months. Additionally, those who apply before January 9 can get 20% back on all US restaurant charges \u2014 up to $100 total \u2014 in the form of a statement credit. Keep in mind you may be able to be targeted for a higher offer.\n\nWhile it's difficult to assign a single objective value to Membership Rewards points, due to the many ways you can redeem them, travel website The Points Guy subjectively estimates each point as worth 1.9\u00a2. That makes the welcome bonus worth $575 \u2014 $475 for the points, and up to $100 back from restaurants. Even without factoring in the annual credit benefits, that's more than enough to make up for the card's $250 annual fee.\n\nClick here to learn more about the AmEx Gold Card from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nWelcome Offer: 60,000 points (after spending $5,000 in the first three months)\n\nThe American Express Platinum card has one of the highest annual fees of any consumer credit or charge card \u2014 $550 \u2014 but as AmEx's flagship product, this premium credit card offers a tremendous amount of value to offset that fee. For example, I got more than $2,000 worth of value in my first year with the card.\n\nThe card earns Membership Rewards points, the currency in AmEx's loyalty program, which can be exchanged for statement credits or cash back, used to book travel through AmEx's travel website, or, to get the most value, transferred to any of 17 airline and three hotel transfer partners (transferable points are among the best). Travel website The Points Guy lists a valuation of 1.9\u00a2 per Membership Rewards point; based on that, the welcome offer is worth around $1,140.\n\nBecause $5,000 is one of the steepest spending requirements of any consumer credit card, this is an ideal time to open it \u2014 with holiday spending and travel coming up, you can take advantage of those planned expenses to meet a higher minimum required spend than you would normally be able to.\n\nThe Platinum Card earns an incredible 5x points on airfare purchased directly from the airline, and offers a $200 airline fee credit each calendar year, and up to $200 in Uber credits each card member year. It also grants the cardholder access to more than 1,000 airport lounges around the world, including Delta Sky Clubs and AmEx's own Centurion Lounges. Other benefits include automatic gold elite status at Starwood, Marriott, and Hilton hotels, a statement credit to cover enrollment in Global Entry/TSA PreCheck, concierge service, and much more.\n\nYou can read our complete review of the card here.\n\nClick here to learn more about the American Express Platinum from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nSign-up bonus: $500 (after spending $3,000 in the first three months)\n\nIf dining and cooking are your thing, and cash back is what you're after, the Capital One Savor is sure to please.\n\nThe card earns unlimited 4% cash back on all dining and entertainment, 2% back at grocery stores, and 1% on everything else. Plus, the card offers a whopping $500 sign-up bonus when you spend $3,000 in the first three months.\n\nThe Savor carries a lower annual fee than the AmEx Gold \u2014 $95, waived the first year. The earning rate will make up for the fee in many cases, based on normal spending, but if that's too high for you, there's an alternative: the Capital One SavorOne Cash Rewards Credit Card.\n\nThe SavorOne card has no annual fee, and offers a slightly lower \u2014 but still valuable \u2014 earning rate of 3% cash back on dining and entertainment, 2% back at grocery stores, and 1% on everything else. It offers a lower sign-up bonus of $150 when you spend $500 in the first three months.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Capital One Savor card from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Capital One SavorOne card from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nRead more: The Capital One Savor offers 4% cash back on dining and entertainment \u2014 here's how much the average American saves each year with the card\n\nAmerican Express\n\nWelcome offer: 125,000 Hilton Honors points when you spend $2,000 in the first three months\n\nHilton recently announced new highest-ever bonuses on its four co-branded credit cards, which offers a fantastic opportunity to rack up points for free hotel nights.\n\nA major benefit to the Hilton Honors rewards program is when you stay for free using points, it's actually free \u2014 unlike many other hotels, you won't even have to pay a resort fee. Despite some recent minor devaluations in the program, it's turning into my go-to for hotels.\n\nBetween the 125,000-point welcome bonus, and the fact that the Ascend card offers a free weekend night's stay when you spend $15,000 on it within a calendar year, you've got the makings of a nice long hotel stay without having to pay a thing.\n\nThe Ascend has a $95 annual fee, but offers some solid benefits to make up for that.\n\nThe card offers complimentary Gold status just for holding it. If you spend $40,000 on the card within a calendar year, you'll be upgraded to Diamond status. In addition to the same benefits you'd get from Gold \u2014 such as free breakfast, room upgrades, a bonus on earned points, late checkout, and a free fifth reward night \u2014 Diamond gets you higher priority for room upgrades, executive lounge access, and more. The card also comes with 10 free day passes to Priority Pass airport lounges.\n\nThe Ascend earns 12x points on Hilton purchases, 6x points at restaurants, gas stations, and supermarkets \u2014 all within the US \u2014 and 3x points on everything else.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hilton Honors Ascend card from Insider Picks' partner The Points Guy.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nSign-up bonus: 50,000 points (after spending $4,000 in the first three months)\n\nThe Sapphire Preferred is one of the most popular all-around rewards credit cards, and it's easy to see why. This card earns 2x points per dollar spent on just about all travel and dining purchases, and 1x point on everything else. It also comes with a ton of travel and purchase protections, such as rental car insurance, trip delay coverage, and extended warranty.\n\nThe sign-up bonus \u2014 50,000 UR points \u2014 is worth, at the very least, $500 as cash back or gift cards. However, if you book travel through the Chase Ultimate Rewards portal and use points to pay, you'll get a 25% bonus, making points worth 1.25 cents each. That means that the sign-up bonus would be worth $625.\n\nEven more lucrative \u2014 the Chase Sapphire Preferred lets you transfer your UR points to a few different frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs. This comes in handy because, in many cases, it costs fewer points to book a trip if you go through one of those programs, as opposed to using the points as cash. You can read more about why transferring points to frequent flyer programs gets you more value here.\n\nThis all comes for a fairly standard annual fee of $95, which is waived the first year.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Sapphire Preferred from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nChase/Instagram\n\nSign-up bonus: 50,000 points (after spending $4,000 in the first three months)\n\nThe Sapphire Reserve is basically a beefier version of the Preferred. While the card comes with the same sign-up bonus, it earns points on everyday spending faster, nabbing a higher 3x points per dollar spent on travel and dining purchases, and 1x on everything else. It also offers similar, though in many cases, enhanced travel and purchase protections.\n\nUnlike the Preferred, the Sapphire Reserve comes with a Priority Pass Select membership, which gets you and any travel companions free access to more than 1,000 airport lounges around the world.\n\nYou can use points from the Reserve the same ways as with the Preferred, except that you'll get a 50% bonus when booking travel through Chase, making your points worth 1.5\u00a2 each.\n\nThe card carries a higher annual fee than the Preferred: $450. However, it also comes with a $300 travel credit each card member year. Each year, you'll get statement credits for the first $300 in travel-related purchases you make, including things like subway fare, taxis, parking, and tolls, as well as airfare and hotels. When you subtract this credit from the annual fee, the card is effectively only $150 each year.\n\nIf you're not sure whether the Preferred or Reserve is the better card for you, take a look at this breakdown. Also keep in mind that you can typically only earn the sign-up bonus for one Sapphire-branded card every two years.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Sapphire Reserve from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nWelcome offer: 150,000 Hilton Honors points when you spend $4,000 in the first three months\n\nThe premium Hilton Honors American Express Aspire card has a hefty $450 annual fee, but it comes with so many perks, benefits, and rebates that it's more than worth paying for Hilton loyalists \u2014 or even brand-agnostic hotel guests.\n\nIn addition to a $250 airline fee credit per calendar year and a $250 Hilton resort statement credit each card member year, the Aspire also offers a $100 Hilton on-property credit every time you book a stay of two nights or longer at a Hilton property \u2014 you just need to book through a specific website for cardholders.\n\nThe card also offers a free weekend night reward each year \u2014 regardless of how much you spend \u2014 and a second if you spend $60,000 on the card in a calendar year. It also comes with complimentary Diamond status.\n\nThe Aspire earns a tremendous 14x points per dollar spent with Hilton, 7x points on flights booked with the airline, car rentals, and at US restaurants, and 3x points on everything else.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hilton Honors Aspire card from Insider Picks' partner The Points Guy.\n\nSign-up bonus: 60,000 miles (after spending $5,000 in the first 90 days)\n\nEarlier this year, Barclays closed applications for one of its most popular credit cards, before relaunching the card with a new all-time highest sign-up bonus.\n\nThen, this fall, Barclays began waiving the card's $89 annual fee for the first year, a first for the card.\n\nThe Barclaycard Arrival Plus earns double miles on every dollar spent. Miles can be redeemed for one cent each on travel purchases (applied as a statement credit to negate the cost of that purchase), or a half-cent each for cash back or gift cards. Best of all, you'll earn 5% of your miles back every time you make a redemption.\n\nEffectively, that means that the sign-up bonus is worth $600 toward travel, plus an extra $100 from the miles you'll earn meeting the spending requirement.\n\nThe card comes equipped with Chip-and-PIN service, which, combined with the fact that the card has no foreign transaction fees, makes it a great option when traveling internationally.\n\nDepending on your spending habits, it is easy to get more value from the card than what you pay for the annual fee, thanks to the 2x earning rate on all purchases. Of course, the sign-up bonus alone will cover the annual fee for more than seven years.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard.\n\nSign-up bonus: 15,000 points or $150 cash back (after spending $500 in the first three months)\n\nIf you already have the Sapphire Reserve and are saving your points for something, the Freedom Unlimited can give your balance a nice boost. While Chase markets the card as \"cash back,\" it actually earns Ultimate Rewards points that you can redeem for cash (1 point = 1\u00a2).\n\nIf you have a premium card like the Sapphire Reserve, you can pool your points from the two cards. The Freedom Unlimited earns 1.5 points per dollar spent, so paired with a Sapphire Reserve, it's a great card to use for purchases that aren't made on travel expenses or dining.\n\nBest of all, the card has no annual fee and often has 0% APR for the first 15 months on purchases and balance transfers. After that, there's a 16.99%-25.74% variable APR. If you have a major purchase ahead of you, that introductory offer can be useful.\n\nWhile the best financial practice is to not spend more on the holidays than you can afford to pay off right away, the Freedom Unlimited's introductory APR does provide an option to pay a major expenses off over time without paying interest. That can be useful if you're planning out how to pay for something like an engagement ring during the holidays.\n\nThe Chase Freedom Unlimited is a fantastic all-around card. However, to get the most value when it's time to spend your points, you need the Sapphire Reserve or Preferred card, too, so you can pool your points. Otherwise, points are only worth 1\u00a2 each no matter how you use them and they can't be transferred to airline or hotel partners.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Chase Freedom Unlimited from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.\n\nThe Points Guy\n\nWelcome offer: 30,000 Go Far points (after spending $3,000 in the first three months)\n\nThis new card from Wells Fargo has one of the more attractive rewards offerings you'll find from a no-annual-fee card. The new Propel card is actually a re-launch of an old product \u2014 Wells Fargo stopped accepting applications for the old card back in February, before announcing the new product and reopening applications this month.\n\nThe card earns 3x points on all travel, dining, and select streaming services (and 1x point on everything else). If that sounds familiar, it's because it's almost the same as the popular Chase Sapphire Reserve.\n\nThere are some key differences between the cards. The Propel lets you redeem points for 1\u00a2 each toward cash back, merchandise, travel, or more, while the Sapphire Reserve offers a range of more valuable redemption options \u2014 it's easy to get at least 50% more value for Chase points. Plus, the Sapphire Reserve offers a number of premium perks that the Propel doesn't, like airport lounge access, a $300 annual travel credit travel delay insurance, and more.\n\nOf course, the Sapphire Reserve also comes with a $450 annual fee, while the Wells Fargo Propel doesn't have a fee. Between the new member offer, and the solid earning rate on popular spend categories, the Propel makes a decent option for those who don't travel often, or who aren't comfortable floating a large annual fee.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Wells Fargo Propel card from Insider Picks' partner: The Points Guy.", "The Democratic Senate candidate for Tennessee, whom Taylor Swift endorsed in a high-profile break from her political silence last month, has lost.\n\nSwift endorsed Phil Bredesen on Instagram in October, saying that she was spurred to speak out in opposition to the Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who represents Tennessee's 7th District in the US House, saying Blackburn's voting record \"appalls and terrifies me.\"\n\nBlackburn \u2014 who has opposed same-sex marriage, argued to defund Planned Parenthood, and is conservative on issues like gun control and immigration \u2014 kept the red state in Republican hands.\n\nSwift described her opposition to Blackburn in October, writing on Instagram: \"I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love.\"\n\nRead More: Midterms 2018 LIVE: Democrats take the House, GOP holds the Senate in a wild election night\n\nBlackburn was slated to win in the solidly Republican state, but Democrats' hopes were raised when voter registration spiked after Swift's endorsement.\n\nAbout 65,000 people nationwide registered to vote in the 24 hours after the endorsement, Vote.org said. 44,801 of those people were between the ages of 18 and 24.\n\nSwift also endorsed Rep.

Bernie Sanders at a healthcare rally. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nIn Trump's midterm campaign push, he repeatedly hammered the issue of immigration, often blaming Democrats for a caravan of Central American migrants whom he branded \"invaders\" heading toward the US's southern border.\n\nDemocrats, who have struggled to get a word in around Trump's media dominance, explicitly tried to focus the voting public on healthcare, and they look to have narrowly won the messaging battle.\n\nAn Associated Press exit poll of more than 115,000 voters found that 26% named healthcare as the most important issue facing the country. Immigration trailed just behind at 23%. These numbers roughly track with Google search data that showed more of the voting public searching for healthcare than for immigration.\n\nAmong Democratic voters, nearly 40% named healthcare as their priority, with a similar number of Republicans picking immigration.\n\nDemocrats specifically hammered Republicans on the issue of healthcare protections for people with preexisting medical conditions \u2014 protections the GOP has consistently worked to erode. Trump may have entered damage-control mode by suggesting throughout the campaign that his party would protect those with preexisting conditions, even though historically he has worked for the opposite.\n\nRead more:2018 has already broken early-voting records.

For one, he's assuming that anyone borrowing Tesla stock intends to short it. And second, he falsely concludes that it dilutes outstanding shares.\n\nThe expert is Bob Sloan, the managing partner at S3 Partners, a financial technology and analytics company that's built a thriving business by providing accurate data on shorts.\n\n\"Musk is out there saying it creates greater shares outstanding for the company, and that's just not true,\" Sloan told Business Insider in an interview. \"He assumes it's only being used for naked short-selling, which is also not true.\"\n\nSloan is quick to point out that he doesn't specifically begrudge Musk. He also doesn't side with anyone in the eternal battle of companies versus the short-sellers who wager against them. He's more focused on correcting the misinformation being spread about the impact of stock borrowing.\n\nAfter all, if a genius like Musk can get it wrong, what does it mean for the rest of the market?\n\nFlawed thinking\n\nSloan says Musk's flawed take is just one high-profile example of a broader misunderstanding facing the short market: the idea that shares borrowed directly reflects short interest.\n\nThe issue, Sloan says, is how the data people consume is fed to them and ultimately applied.\n\n\"Just because someone borrowed the stock doesn't mean it finds its way into the marketplace as a transacted short sale,\" he said. \"Those two things are very different from one another. And yet, because of how data has been contributed to the marketplace, those two things \u2014 the borrow and the executed short sale \u2014 have become conflated as the same thing. And they're not.\"\n\nIt's also incorrect to assume that fluctuations in stock borrowing hold any direct bearing on the underlying share price, as Musk has suggested on multiple occasions.\n\nThis chart, constructed by Sloan and his colleagues at S3, shows this to be true. On occasions when stock borrow has fluctuated 10% in either direction, the impact on price has been normally distributed. Further, the charts are almost identical for both positive and negative changes in stock borrow.\n\nS3 Partners\n\n\"The amount of borrow has absolutely nothing to do with what's been transacted in the marketplace,\" Sloan said. \"There are probably 10 things a stock can be borrowed for that have nothing to do with the execution of a short sale.\"\n\nThe role of contribution bias\n\nSloan's argument is built around challenging the faulty principles that have been ingrained in peoples' minds. Many people have become so accustomed to interpreting data a certain way, or taking flawed data at face value, and he wants to upend those conventions.\n\nS3's technology has allowed it to tackle this data and scrub it clean. The ultimate goal is to provide an accurate, anonymized data stream that eliminates the biases that exist within what Sloan describes as a \"give to get\" model.\n\nThe inaccurate musings of someone like Musk \u2014 and the impact they have on how people are (mis)understanding data and general market dynamics \u2014 are exactly what S3 is seeking to disprove.\n\nAnd in light of Musk's tweetstorm last month, the firm wants you to know that Tesla's stock is not being damaged by borrowing activity, nor is its liquidity being hurt. The same goes for any company whose shares are being borrowed across the market.\n\n\"Chief executives conflate securities lending with float and liquidity,\" Sloan said. \"We're debunking the contribution bias that already exists.\"", "Facebook pulled down 115 Instagram and Facebook accounts this week over fears they were meddling in the midterms.

Much more important, he said, was Britain's participation within non-EU agencies such as NATO, the UN Security Council, and the Five Eyes intelligence community.\n\nNonetheless, he said that the lack of \"political bandwidth\" as officials focus on Brexit at the expense of other policy areas could hamper the government's stated goal to maintain its international standing.\n\nThe government's opponents accused May of taking her eye off the ball on national security.\n\n\"These words from someone so senior and who worked so closely with the Prime Minister should be a wake up call for Downing Street,\" Liberal Democrat MP and Best for Britain campaigner Layla Moran said.\n\n\"It seems it's not just schools, the NHS and children's services that are falling off the agenda but also the vital work of national security...\n\n\"The government have been consumed with trying to turn this pigs ear Brexit into anything that looks borderline acceptable to the public, even though it just won't work. The civil service is being stretched towards breaking point by this ongoing car crash Brexit.\"\n\n'We are on the positive side of the ledger'\n\nGetty\n\nSince leaving government, Lyall Grant has taken up a position as a senior advisor at CTD Advisors, a firm which provides strategic advice to firms expanding into emerging markets, and he said that Brexit provided an opportunity for firms to build trade links outside Europe at a time when firms are placing \"an increasing focus on the rest of the world.\"\n\nHe also remains confident that Britain will strike a deal with Brussels, because Britain is a \"net contributor\" to European security and because he said it was in both parties' interests that the UK continued to participate within information-sharing agencies such as Europol, the Schengen Information System, and the European Arrest Warrant.\n\n\"We are on the positive side of the ledger,\" he said.\n\n\"European leaders understand and recognise that.\n\n\"By the time negotiations come to and end, there will undoubtedly be a deal that will allow cooperation to continue because it is in the Europeans' interests and it is in our interests.\"\n\nDowning Street were contacted for comment but did not respond by the time of publication.", "Fox News host Chris Wallace was wary of \"giving too much credit\" to President Donald Trump in light of the Republican Party flipping several Senate seats during the 2018 midterm elections.\n\n\"If I may just tap on the brakes a little bit, I think we are overstating ... giving too much credit to Donald Trump for holding on to the Senate,\" Wallace said on Tuesday. \"The fact is this was a historically difficult year for the Democrats.\"\n\n\"What we're talking about tonight, and I'm not in any way diminishing Donald Trump's efforts, or the fact that he's held on to the Senate, and the importance of it, but we're talking about the fact that the Republicans have taken seats in North Dakota, Indiana, and Texas, which are very red states,\" Wallace said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump.

She was also the first black woman to be a major party nominee during a gubernatorial election.\n\nThe 44-year-old Atlanta-based attorney downplayed the historical significance of her potential win on the eve of Election Day.\n\n\"I don't want anyone to vote for me because I'm black,\" Abrams said in Savannah on Monday. \"And no one on the ballot needs a vote because we're women.

According to a 2017 voting law, election officials may put \"on hold\" any voter registration application that does not match existing identification records. This \"exact match\" requirement would flag and stall registrations with minor errors, including misspelled names or a dropped hyphen.\n\nThe outcome of Georgia's gubernatorial election resembled other states on Election Day. In Florida, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum conceded to Republican candidate Ron DeSantis after trailing by one percentage point, or around 76,000 votes.\n\nSimilar to Kemp, DeSantis secured President Donald Trump's endorsement, while Gillum and Abrams received endorsements from Obama.", "Democrat Jacky Rosen beat her Republican opponent Dean Heller in the Nevada Senate race \u2014 a swing state with a history of sending moderates to Washington.\n\nThe race was a key target for Democrats in their uphill battle to take control of the Senate. Heller, a first-term senator and former congressman who has spent three decades in politics, was widely viewed as the GOP's most vulnerable incumbent in the chamber.\n\nFormer Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won the state in 2016 by 2.4 percentage points, while Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was elected by a similar margin. Obama won the state by 6.7 points in 2012.\n\nHeller angered the GOP's increasingly right-wing base when he refused to endorse Trump's version of a border wall, criticized the president's pardon of former Maricopa county Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and said he had \"no problem\" funding Planned Parenthood (despite his record of voting to end federal reimbursements to the healthcare provider).\n\nHeller also changed his position on the Affordable Care Act, initially opposing the GOP's Obamacare repeal efforts citing cuts to Medicaid. But during a tough primary challenge from the right and attacks from Trump, he supported a Republican Obamacare replacement that would have dramatically reduced federal funding for Medicaid in the long term.\n\nRosen, the former president of one of the largest synagogues in Nevada, was recruited to run for office by former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who in 2016 convinced Rosen run for an open House seat in a southern Nevada district that simultaneously went for Trump. Rosen won the seat by just 1.2 points, or 4,000 votes.\n\nThe congresswoman framed herself as a moderate, touting her membership in the House Problem Solvers Caucus - a group of centrists seeking bipartisan agreement \u2014 and has voted with Trump 41 percent of the time, placing her among the dozen or so most conservative Democrats in the chamber.\n\nNevada has grown increasingly diverse in recent years and immigrants move into the state, and more left-leaning as major companies like Tesla and Google set up offices there, balancing out the state's conservative base in the rural north of the state.\n\nTrump, whose approval rating in Nevada is seven points under water according to recent polling, had campaigned for Heller and targeted Rosen with the nickname \"Wacky Jacky.\" (Trump's approval rating in Nevada dropped about five points between January 2017 and October 2018, and his disapproval numbers jumped from 39 percent to 51 percent in the same period.)\n\nThe state saw enormous turnout \u2014 double the number of early voters got to the polls this year than did in the 2014 midterm elections, which also dwarfed the total voters in 2014.

The amendment proclaims to \"recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life\" in the state. Both Alabama and West Virginia's amendments codify no right to public funding or even access to abortion at the state level.\n\nA similar measure that sought to ban public funding for abortion in Oregon failed to pass. The two initatives in Alabama and West Virginia represent increasing efforts at the state level to restrict abortion access across the country.\n\n\"What we're looking at is a potential rolling back of federal protections of abortion and the decreasing protections in the Alabama and West Virginia constitutions,\" Elizabeth Nash, a senior state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, told The Washington Post about the initiatives.\n\nRead more: 23 creative ways states are keeping women from getting abortions in the US \u2014 that could erode Roe v.

And we clearly have clashing security concepts, not least in the South China Sea.\"\n\nPaulson also lamented the president's slash-and-burn attitude to multilateral institutions and especially his decision to nix the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).\n\n\"To be blunt about this, I wish President Trump would reconsider his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A TPP 2.0 would offer a ready-made vehicle to shape the trade environment in which Beijing operates,\" Paulson said.\n\nBut for all its fireworks and fury, Paulson insisted China does not pose an \"existential threat\" to American civilization.\n\n\"We should prepare for the obvious strategic challenges from China. But in doing so, let's not sacrifice those values \u2014 or the commitment to openness \u2014 that has made us the strongest, most competitive, and most admired country in the world.\"\n\n\"In the 242nd year of our great democratic experiment, we should have more confidence in America and the resilience of our system.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump (L) and China's President Xi Jinping walk along the front patio of the Mar-a-Lago estate after a bilateral meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 7, 2017.

As of now, Democrats will control 230 House seats compared to 198 for Republicans, with 6 races yet to be called or conceded.\n\nFiveThirtyEight's deluxe House forecast \u2014 which includes everything from polls, district fundamentals, fundraising, and candidate quality \u2014 gave the Democrats a six in seven chance of taking back the House, predicting they would gain an average of 36 seats.\n\nTheir House model cast 14 contests as tossup, meaning both candidates had less than a 60% chance of winning, 15 as lean Democratic, and seven as lean Republican.\n\nThe results available so far show that 18 of these swing districts flipped from Republican to Democrat, 6 stayed in Republican hands, one flipped from Democrat to Republican, and three are still too close to call.\n\nHere's which parties and candidates are winning these highly competitive districts:", "Republican attorney general Josh Hawley won a highly contested race for a Senate seat in Missouri following Tuesday's midterm elections, unseating Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill.\n\nThe race between Hawley and McCaskill was one of the most closely watched contests of the 2018 election season. A RealClearPolitics average of the most recent polls had the two candidates in a dead heat, at 46% each. And according to RealClearPolitics polling data, neither candidate has had a lead of more than four points in any poll over the whole year, which places the race within the margin of error.\n\nDuring her concession speech Tuesday night, McCaskill thanked the people of Missouri for allowing her \"to serve the public, to serve them, to be a public servant.\"\n\nShe added: \"It has been such an honor, and this state drives me crazy, but I love every corner of it. I really do. I mean, I even love the reddest of the red counties.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned hard for Hawley in recent days \u2014 he held two rallies in Missouri to boost support for the Republican attorney general. While McCaskill has painted herself as independent from mainstream Democratic thinking in an effort to draw more undecided voters, Hawley has aligned himself closely with the president in order to draw more support from the Republican base.\n\nTwo key issues that Republicans are seizing on going into the midterms are the migrant caravan from Honduras headed toward the US's southern border, and the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Hawley and Trump have focused, in particular, on McCaskill's vote against Kavanaugh to portray her as a hardline Democrat.\n\nMcCaskill was first elected to the Senate in 2006, when she defeated Missouri Republican incumbent Jim Talent. In 2012, it looked like McCaskill may lose her seat to her Republican opponent, GOP Rep. Todd Akin, until he claimed in an interview that a woman could not get pregnant as a result of a \"legitimate rape.\"\n\nThis year, McCaskill faced more of an uphill battle, particularly in a state that Trump won by 20 points in the 2016 US presidential election.", "President Donald Trump issued a triumphant tweet about Tuesday's midterm elections despite the mixed results for the president's party at the polls.\n\n\"Tremendous success tonight,\" Trump said. \"Thank you to all!\"\n\nWhile Trump's tone was upbeat, Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives with major pick ups in suburban areas where the president's approval rating is lower. Democrats were able to ride opposition to Trump to wins in more Democratic-leaning states like New York and deep-red states like Oklahoma. The victory for Democrats could open up the president to possible investigations and stymie the GOP's policy progress.\n\nRead more: Democrats are projected to flip the House in a rebuke of Trump's presidency\u00bb\n\nBut Republicans made significant gains in the Senate, picking up key seats from incumbent Democrats in states where Trump won in 2016 and also turning back possible challenges in high-profile states like Texas. Holding the Senate gives Trump the opportunity to continue the historic pace of judicial nominations that have dominated the chamber's calendar in recent months.\n\nRead more: Republicans projected to hold on to majority control of the Senate\u00bb\n\nThe GOP also got major wins in toss-up governors races in states like Florida and Ohio, though Democrats did manage to pick up wins in a number of states like Illinois and Michigan.\n\nWhether or not the night constitutes a \"blue wave\" for Democrats is unclear given the mixed results overall and the typical losses for the president's party, but the split Congress will make life more difficult for the president.\n\nRonna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, also applauded the president's efforts to support GOP candidates in a statement.\n\n\"Grassroots enthusiasm for President Trump, who did more than any President in history to support Republican candidates, and the Republican Party's expansive get-out-the-vote operation, turned the forecasted Democrat tsunami into a ripple,\" McDaniel said.", "Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis defeated Florida's first-ever black nominee for governor, Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum, on Tuesday in a tight, closely-watched race.\n\nThe congressman's win is also a victory for President Donald Trump, who threw his support behind DeSantis, repeatedly rallying with and tweeting about the candidate. Gillum conceded the race with 49 percent of the vote, to DeSantis' 50 percent, shortly before 11 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nThe competitive race \u2014 widely viewed as a proxy war between the progressive left and the hard right \u2014 attracted intense national scrutiny, with Democrats hopeful for a win amid a surge in voter turnout.\n\nThe candidates \u2014 both 39-year-old dads of young children \u2014 ran on radically different agendas in the country's third-most populous state. And the race exposed personal differences between the two.\n\nJust days into the general election campaign, DeSantis called Gillum an \"articulate spokesman\" for the Democratic Party and warned that the state would \"monkey up\" its economy by putting a \"socialist\" in office \u2014 comments many interpreted as racist. And Gillum faced multiple race-based attacks in the form of white supremacist robocalls.\n\nDeSantis, a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus who saturated his campaign with mention of Trump, campaigned on his military background and deeply conservative positions on abortion, gun rights, and illegal immigration.\n\nGillum, the son of a bus driver and construction worker, highlighted his working-class roots, with promises to invest heavily in the state's public schools and fight for stricter gun regulations and Medicare-for-all.\n\nWhile gubernatorial candidates are often characterized by their centrism, Florida is yet more proof of the ascendance of the progressive left and Trumpian right this year. Both candidates defeated establishment favorites in their respective primaries\u2014 Gillum with the support of the left-wing of the Democratic Party, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, and DeSantis with Trump's strong endorsement.\n\nGillum, who Republicans characterized as far left of Florida's mainstream, ran on a deeply progressive platform, which included the elimination of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \u2014 a call that's gained traction on the left\u2014 and Medicare for All. His primary win \u2014 along with several insurgent upsets from the left this cycle \u2014 represented an increased schism between progressivism and Clinton-style centrism in the Democratic Party.", "On Tuesday, Mississippi voters were in the unique position of electing two US senators in the same year.\n\nThis year, Republican Roger Wicker was projected to win the race at the top of the ballot. He ran against Democratic state Rep. David Baria, as well as Libertarian Party candidate Danny Bedwell and Reform Party candidate Shawn O'Hara.\n\nDemocrats invested more money than is typical in the state's Senate race, but Wicker's campaign funding still far outpaced Baria's. The former raised $6.4 million, while the latter raised just over $780,000.\n\nThe second race on Tuesday's ballot was a special election to elect someone to serve out the remaining two years of incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran's term. That race was projected to go to a runoff after the race was too close to call.\n\nRepublican Cindy Hyde-Smith ran against Democrat Mike Espy, the former US agriculture secretary under President Bill Clinton; Republican Chris McDaniel, a hardline tea party conservative; and Democrat Tobey Bernard Bartee, a military veteran who ran for office for the first time this year.\n\nVoters will elect a winner during a runoff that's set to take place on November 27.\n\nAccording to public filings, Hyde-Smith raised almost $3 million leading up to Tuesday's race, while Espy trailed her at nearly $2 million. McDaniel raised a little over $583,000 and Bartee raised just over $4,000.\n\n71-year-old Bill Inman, a Mississippi resident, told The Associated Press that he planned to vote for McDaniel in the special election, calling the candidate an \"honest man\" who is \"not the establishment.\"\n\nDale Bledsoe, a 61-year-old warehouse district specialist in Picayune, Mississippi, said he voted for Baria and Espy in the race at the top of the ballot and the special election, respectively, because he's also looking for a change.\n\nBledsoe, who is black, told The Associated Press that he wants his vote to help change Mississippi's \"negative history.\"\n\nHe added: \"If we want to bring about a change, we have to take a stand. I'm hoping by casting my vote and doing things of this nature I'm teaching my grandchildren and children: If you don't like the way things are, speak up and try to change them.\"", "Saudis are calling for a boycott of Amazon and its regional subsidiary, Souq.com, in response to The Washington Post's coverage of journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder.\n\nThousands of people on Twitter in Saudi Arabia echoed those calls for a boycott in order to jab Jeff Bezos, who owns The Post and is the founder and biggest shareholder in Amazon.\n\nKhashoggi, who was murdered in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, last month, was a columnist at The Post.\n\n\"Boycott Amazon\" was the top trending hashtag on Twitter in Saudi Arabia for several hours Sunday, according to Bloomberg.\n\nUsers appeared to be angry at The Post's ongoing coverage of Khashoggi's murder, viewing it as an attack on their kingdom's policies.\n\nMany were notably upset by a recent op-ed from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who blasted Saudi officials for trying to \"cover up\" Khashoggi's killing.\n\nRead more: Jamal Khashoggi's sons gave an emotional plea for the return of their father's remains in their first interview since his death\n\nThe Post's editorial board has repeatedly called for transparency in the investigations surrounding Khashoggi's October death and has published gruesome details about the murder citing information from Turkish officials.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia's description of what happened to the 59-year-old has shifted several times, Turkish authorities said he was strangled shortly after he entered the consulate and his body was dismembered.

Heidi Heitkamp lost her re-election bid to current GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer, adding to the Democrats' losses in the US Senate in Tuesday's midterm elections.\n\nHeitkamp defended the seat she won in 2012 in deep Trump territory, which gave Cramer \u2014 who is currently serving the the House \u2014 a decided advantage heading into Election Day. The president won the state with a 63% share of the vote in 2016 but his popularity slid slightly in the state over the past two years. According to Morning Consul\n\nCramer played up connections with Trump throughout the campaign, while Heitkamp struck a more independent tone on issues.\n\nThe race opened up in the run up to the election with Cramer holding an 11 percentage point lead in RealClearPolitics polling average. That was a significant jump from Cramer's slim 1.6 point lead at the end of September. Most election forecasters also gave the edge to Cramer heading into election night.\n\nThe issues\n\nHeitkamp touted bipartisan credentials, such as a vote for a Republican-backed plan that eased regulations on small and mid-sized banks. The senator voted for Trump-supported legislation 55% of the time, the second-most of any Democrat.\n\nHeitkamp attacked Cramer for voting in favor of the American Health Care Act, the GOP's Obamacare replacement, which would have weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nThe former North Dakota attorney general also used Trump's trade war with China as a weapon against Cramer. China's tariffs on American soybeans have caused Chinese orders of the crop to plummet, resulting in a massive supple increase, plummeting prices, and a growing store of soybeans that could rot before the tariffs are lifted.\n\nCramer, who voted with Trump close to 99% of the time, played up ties with the president on the campaign trail. The former chairman of the state's Republican party touted the GOP tax law and hammered Heitkamp for voting against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nHeitkamp also drew flak after running an ad that featured the names of sexual assault victims without their consent.

A surge in millennial and black voters, coupled with a deep gender gap, helped propel Democrats to victory in dramatically different districts.\n\nAnd Democrats ran the most diverse slate of candidates for the House in US history. Women and people of color made up nearly 60% of Democratic House candidates.\n\nEnthusiasm for Tuesday's elections \u2014 exhibited in huge voter turnout \u2014 reached levels unprecedented in modern history with 28 states far exceeding (and some doubling) 2014 midterm turnout.\n\nThe future of the 'resistance' in the House\n\nDemocratic leadership has promised that they will move forward with investigations into the president's alleged wrongdoing while simultaneously pursuing possible bipartisan solutions on issues including infrastructure, gun safety, prescription drug prices, and a path to citizenship for DREAMers \u2014 undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children.\n\nDemocrats also say they'll focus on promoting stricter regulations on ethics and campaign finance \u2014 areas where Trump has been widely criticized.\n\nRep.

Joe Donnelly in Indiana.\n\nRepublican Kevin Cramer picked up North Dakota's Senate seat from incumbent Democratic Sen.

The move was seen as highly political and part of McConnell's broader plan and forming legacy of rapidly confirming conservative judicial nominees.\n\nState work periods reserved for October were also shortened, resulting in Democrats cutting a deal with McConnell to confirm 15 lifetime appointed judges in exchange for being allowed to go home for the campaign.\n\nRepublicans will be able to continue shaping the courts\n\nOne of the most significant effects of Republicans keeping the Senate majority is that they will be able to continue confirming President Donald Trump's judicial nominees, furthering an already record-breaking process of pushing through lifetime appointed judges.\n\nDuring the first two years of the Trump presidency, the McConnell-led Senate has confirmed 84 judges. So far, 29 have been Appeals Court judges, 53 have been for state district courts, and two have been confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\nWith a long list of vacancies still set to be filled, the Republican-controlled Senate can keep confirming judicial nominees at a breakneck speed. In addition, the possibility of another Supreme Court vacancy could arise before the 2020 election cycle gets underway.\n\nThe likelihood of other accomplishments could still be a difficult task for Republicans. The GOP is still shy of being able to surpass the 60-vote threshold for legislation, which Trump has often derided as an impediment to his agenda.\n\nWhile Republicans would like to take another crack at repealing the Affordable Care Act, as well as potentially moving forward on additional tax cuts, in could be an extremely heavy lift that has failed multiple times before.", "Progressive challenger Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez celebrates at a victory party in the Bronx after upsetting incumbent Democratic Representative Joseph Crowley on June 26, 2018 in New York City.

For the current study, researchers analyzed the proportion of pregnant women who used alcohol, tobacco or cannabis from 2002 to 2016.\n\nOverall, the odds that pregnant women would use cannabis rose 3 percent a year during the study period, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics. The increases were only seen in the first trimester and were most pronounced for women ages 26 to 44 and with at least a high school education.\n\nOver the same period, the odds that pregnant women would use alcohol decreased two percent a year and the odds for cigarette use dropped three percent a year.\n\n\"Our findings are a reminder that while we are doing a decent job of discouraging pregnant women from using alcohol and tobacco during pregnancy, the message regarding potential adverse effects of cannabis exposure during pregnancy on fetal development is not getting out there,\" said lead study author Arpana Agrawal of Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis.\n\nThe proportion of pregnant women using cannabis rose from less than 3 percent in 2002 to almost five percent by 2016, the study found.\n\nDuring this period, the proportion of pregnant women using alcohol fell from about 10 percent to about 8 percent, and the proportion using cigarettes dropped from about 18 percent to about 10 percent.\n\nThe study can't prove that cannabis, alcohol or tobacco impacts the health of pregnant women or their babies, nor can it explain why cannabis use rose while use of other substances declined.\n\n\"It is possible that the strong public health messages regarding the potential harms of alcohol and tobacco exposure during pregnancy have resulted in women being less likely to use them,\" Agrawal said by email.\n\nDoctors might also place more emphasis on warning women against the use of alcohol and cigarettes during pregnancy because these habits are more common than the use of cannabis or other drugs, Agrawal said.\n\n\"It is also possible that as cannabis use is increasingly viewed with permissiveness, or because it can be prescribed as a medicine in some states, there might be the misunderstanding that it is safe to use during pregnancy,\" Agrawal added.\n\nSome women may have heard that cannabis helps with pregnancy-related nausea, she noted. But most of the research linking cannabis to reduced nausea symptoms has involved cancer patients suffering from side effects of chemotherapy, and not pregnant women suffering from morning sickness.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists discourages doctors from prescribing or suggesting the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes while women are trying to conceive, pregnant, or nursing their babies.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/2F2iXzQ JAMA Pediatrics, online November 5, 2018.", "While millions of Americans across the country have set records for early voting, and even more headed to the polls to vote on Election Day, approximately 6 million Americans remain legally barred from voting because they hold felony convictions.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the state with the highest rate of felon disenfranchisement overturned the longstanding practice.\n\nFlorida voters passed Amendment 4, giving 1.5 million citizens with felony convictions in the state the right to vote, except those convicted of murder and felony sex crimes.\n\nDating back to skyrocketing incarceration rates beginning in the 1970s with the start of the War on Drugs, the number of people disenfranchised from a criminal conviction has jumped from 1.2 million people in 1970, to 6.1 million today.\n\nNearly every state restricts the rights of people with felony convictions to vote in some way.\n\nWhile most of those states automatically restore the civil rights of felons upon their release from prison or after completion of parole or probation, some permanently disenfranchise those convicted of serious crimes (like Nevada and Arizona) or election-related offenses (like in Missouri).\n\nIn Florida, which disenfranchised felons for life a staggering 1.5 million voting-age residents, and 23% of African-American adults cannot vote due to a previous felony conviction.\n\nRob Scott, director of the Cornell University Prison Education Program, told Business Insider that while the amendment technically applies to all 1.5 million people with felony convictions, he estimates that since around 400,000 are currently in jail or on probation/parole and 100,000 have murder or felony sex crimes, about 1 million would gain their right to vote back immediately.\n\nIowa and Kentucky are other states that still disenfranchise felons for life. Not only do those people permanently lose their right to vote, but also the right to serve on a jury of their peers, run for office, own a firearm, or obtain a professional license \u2014 unless they receive clemency from the governor.\n\nBecause the clemency process is entirely up to the executive branch and not the legislature, procedures in Florida had varied drastically depending on who the governor was. Republican Gov. Jeb Bush granted clemency to about one-fifth of the 385,522 applicants for clemency from 1997 to 2007.\n\nWhen Democratic Gov. Charlie Crist took office in 2007, he overhauled the clemency system, automatically restoring voting rights to non-violent offenders upon the completion of their sentences and putting violent ones into a review process. When Crist was Governor from 2007 to 2011, 150,000 people with felony convictions regained their civil rights.\n\nBut when Republican Gov. Rick Scott came into power, he made the rules for receiving clemency stricter than ever before, and only granted clemency to 3,000 applicants in eight years, leading the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union to estimate that the current backlog of clemency applications will take decades to clear up.\n\nRead more:The evolution of American voting rights in 242 years shows how far we've come \u2014 and how far we have to go\n\nWhat will change in Florida\n\nIn this, Monday, Oct. 22, 2018 photo, people gather around the Ben & Jerry's \"Yes on 4\" truck as they learn about Amendment 4 and eat free ice cream at Charles Hadley Park in Miami. Associated Press/Wilfredo Lee\n\nIn Florida, a person with a felony conviction had to wait 5 years before applying for clemency to regain their civil rights. The 5-year waiting period re-started if they were arrested anytime within it, even if no charges were filed.\n\nAfter the waiting period, the application, and sometimes a hearing, a person could be denied restoration with no justification, and had to wait another two years before applying again. A federal judge recently ruled that the current system of clemency under Scott was unconstitutional, and the state had to reform it to be less arbitrary and set out clearer criteria for receiving clemency.\n\nBut this Election Day, voters decided that all of that should change.\n\nFloridians who could vote on Tuesday passed the ballot referendum Amendment 4\u2014 enacting a state constitutional amendment automatically restoring voting rights to most felons after completion of their sentences.\n\nThe issue had gotten more and more attention in the media since the referendum made it on the ballot. An average of three polls conducted before Election Day showed that 66% of those polled supported the amendment, while 25% opposed it, and 8% were undecided.\n\nFlorida's decision is the single largest granting of voting rights since the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution extended the right to vote to women in 1920.\n\n\"Enfranchising a million voters is nothing small,\" Scott said. \"It is a big deal and a shift in American criminal justice policy thinking in relation to the concept of rehabilitation and second chances.\"\n\nBut he also warned that despite this historic enfranchisement, politicians in Florida may now pass new laws intended to increase the number of people on probation and parole-and thus unable to vote under Amendment 4.\n\n\"The next thing is to ask whether the Republican controlled [Florida] house will encourage them to vote, or whether there will be statutes passed to expand parole and probation in order to disenfranchise the newly enfranchised voters,\" Scott added.\n\nRead more of Business Insider's 2018 Midterm Election coverage:", "Democrat Max Rose beat incumbent Republican Rep.
