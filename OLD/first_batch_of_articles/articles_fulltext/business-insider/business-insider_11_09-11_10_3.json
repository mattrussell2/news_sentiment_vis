["A Victoria's Secret executive apologized on Friday for saying he didn't think transgender models should be cast in the lingerie brand's annual fashion show.\n\nEd Razek, the chief marketing officer of the Victoria's Secret parent company, L Brands, sparked an outcry after telling Vogue in an interview that he didn't think the annual fashion shows should feature \"transsexuals\" because \"the show is a fantasy.\"\n\n\"It's a 42-minute entertainment special. That's what it is,\" he said. \"It is the only one of its kind in the world, and any other fashion brand in the world would take it in a minute, including the competitors that are carping at us.\"\n\nRazek also said in the interview that the company had considered casting both transgender models and plus-sized models in the show in the past.\n\n\"We market to who we sell to, and we don't market to the whole world,\" he said. \"We attempted to do a television special for plus-sizes [in 2000]. No one had any interest in it, still don't.\"\n\nRead more:Victoria's Secret says its 'runways have been culturally diverse for a long time,' but it has been accused of cultural appropriation over and over again\n\nBut Razek apologized for the remark about transgender models in a statement released by Victoria's Secret late Friday. He said the company would, indeed, cast transgender models, though none have made the cut in the past.\n\nHere's Razek's full statement:\n\n\"My remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show came across as insensitive. I apologize. To be clear, we absolutely would cast a transgender model for the show. We've had transgender models come to castings\u2026 And like many others, they didn't make it\u2026But it was never about gender. I admire and respect their journey to embrace who they really are.\"", "After the attorney Michael Avenatti said he was investigating a claim that the Fox News host Tucker Carlson \"assaulted\" a \"gay Latino immigrant,\" Carlson responded in a statement to Business Insider that he did not assault the man and that the man called his 19-year-old daughter a \"whore\" and a \"f---ing c---.\"\n\nThe incident in question occurred last month at a country club in Virginia. In a video Avenatti attached to his tweet announcing his investigation, Carlson appears to be telling another man to \"get the f--- out of here\" while others seem to be trying to get Carlson and others in the room to calm down.\n\nThe video does not appear to show Carlson physically assaulting anyone.\n\nAt one point in the video, a man is heard saying, \"There's no excuse for violence.\"\n\nAfter Carlson released his statement about the incident, Avenatti took to Twitter to respond.\n\nAddressing Carlson, Avenatti wrote: \"Your stmt about what transpired is an absolute lie. Your daughter nor your son were called those things. The man never admitted it. Your son committed assault and battery.\"\n\nHere's Carlson's full statement about the incident:\n\n\"On October 13, I had dinner with two of my children and some family friends at the Farmington Country Club in Charlottesville, Virginia. Toward the end of the meal, my 19-year-old daughter went to the bathroom with a friend. On their way back through the bar, a middle aged man stopped my daughter and asked if she was sitting with Tucker Carlson. My daughter had never seen the man before. She answered: 'That's my dad,' and pointed to me. The man responded, 'Are you Tucker's whore?' He then called her a 'f------ c---.'\n\n\"My daughter returned to the table in tears. She soon left the table and the club. My son, who is also a student, went into the bar to confront the man. I followed. My son asked the man if he'd called his sister a 'whore' and a 'cunt.' The man admitted he had, and again become profane. My son threw a glass of red wine in the man's face and told him to leave the bar, which he soon did.\n\n\"Immediately after the incident, I described these events to the management of the Farmington Country Club. The club spent more than three weeks investigating the incident. Last week, they revoked the man's membership and threw him out of the club.\n\n\"I love my children. It took enormous self-control not to beat the man with a chair, which is what I wanted to do. I think any father can understand the overwhelming rage and shock that I felt seeing my teenage daughter attacked by a stranger. But I restrained myself. I did not assault this man, and neither did my son. That is a lie. Nor did I know the man was gay or Latino, not that it would have mattered. What happened on October 13 has nothing to do with identity politics. It was a grotesque violation of decency. I've never seen anything like it in my life.\"\n\nRead more:Fox News told staff not to tweet its content from their personal accounts amid Tucker Carlson protests, according to internal email\n\nAvenatti responded that Carlson's statement was 'an absolute lie'\n\nMichael Avenatti speaks to media as he exits the United States District Court Southern District of New York on May 30, 2018 Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images\n\nAfter Business Insider reached out for comment about Carlson's statement, Avenatti took to Twitter to respond.\n\nAddressing Carlson, Avenatti wrote: \"Your stmt about what transpired is an absolute lie. Your daughter nor your son were called those things. The man never admitted it. Your son committed assault and battery.\"\n\nHe added: \"You committed assault (learn the difference). Your friend committed assault ... and battery (on video). You are the aggressor in the video as is your friend. The man at the bar sits there calmly. Numerous witnesses contradict your claim of innocence. Your daughter was drinking underage in a bar with your assistance and knowledge. You were intoxicated.\"\n\nAvenatti continued and said Carlson \"told the man to 'go back where you came from' before the video starts.\"\n\n\"And if you were so innocent, why didn't you disclose it weeks ago as you recently did in connection with the protest at your home?\" Avenatti asked.\n\nIn a phone call, Avenatti confirmed to Business Insider that the man Carlson was screaming at was his client, Juan Manuel Granados, saying, \"My client was not the aggressor, he wants the truth and he wants justice and I'm going to hold Tucker Carlson accountable.\"\n\nAvenatti tweeted a statement from Granados Sunday:\n\nAvenatti also went on to support Carlson's assertion that there was private \"investigation\" into the dispute. Denying to disclose the result of that investigation, Avenatti characterized the country club as being known as \"anti-gay, anti-minority, and anti-people of color.\"\n\nGranados has previously had a dispute with a different club, suing Roanoke Athletic Club for not granting him, his partner, and their child a family membership. After the filing, the club changed their membership policy to include same-sex couples.\n\nWhen Business Insider sent a report on the suit to Avenatti for comment, he tweeted out the report as evidence of Granados' character, writing, \"Juan is a leader in the community who has a history of standing up for what is right.\"\n\nAvenatti said that while the current case is still in the investigatory phase, he anticipates charges being filed against Carlson's son, \"possibly against Tucker himself,\" and against the \"balding man.\"\n\nAdult film actress Stormy Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, speaks to media with lawyer Michael Avenatti outside federal court in Manhattan on April 16, 2018.

A right-wing commentator, Carlson frequently laid into Avenatti and Daniels on his primetime show, and the two men often spar over Avenatti's opposition to the president.\n\nRecently, when Carlson invited Avenatti to appear on his show, he ran a banner at the bottom of the screen describing Avenatti as a \"Creepy Porn Lawyer.\"\n\nAfter rowdy protests at Carlson's home, Fox News tells staff not to tweet out its content\n\nOn Wednesday, Carlson made headlines when it emerged that demonstrators from the self-described anti-fascist group \"Smash Racism DC\" engaged in rowdy protests in front of Carlson's home.\n\nCarlson, who was at work at the time, claimed his wife was home when a protester allegedly threw \"himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door,\" The Washington Post reported. Police reportedly confirmed that members of the group also spray-painted an anarchy symbol on the driveway of Carlson's home and left signs on vehicles.\n\nEarlier Saturday, Business Insider learned that Fox News has asked its employees not to tweet out its content from their business or personal Twitter accounts, according to an internal email.

(AP) \u2014 The Florida secretary of state ordered recounts in the US Senate and governor races on Saturday, an unprecedented review of two major races in the state that took five weeks to decide the 2000 presidential election.\n\nSecretary Ken Detzner issued the order after the unofficial results in both races fell within the margin that by law triggers a recount. His office was unaware of any other time either a governor race or US Senate race required a recount, let alone both in the same election.\n\nThe unofficial results show that Republican former Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by less than 0.5 percentage points, which will require a machine recount of ballots.\n\nIn the Senate race, Republican Gov. Rick Scott's lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson is less than 0.25 percentage points, which will require a hand recount of ballots from tabulation machines that couldn't determine which candidate got the vote.\n\nRead more: The midterm elections proved Florida and Ohio are still solidly Trump country\n\nSaturday's development's return Florida to the center of a major political drama 18 years after an infamous presidential recount left control of the White House undecided for more than a month.\n\nThe latest recount underscores the deep divides plaguing one of the most critical states in American politics. Beyond determining the governorship, it will decide whether Nelson returns to Washington for a fourth term or whether Republicans will pad their majority in the Senate.\n\nFlorida's 67 counties will decide when to begin the recounts. They could start the moment Detzner issued his order, or elections officials can wait until Sunday or Monday. But they must finish the machine recounts by 3 p.m. Thursday. Hand recounts will be reflected in official election results due Nov. 18.\n\nGillum conceded to DeSantis on Tuesday night, but when the results began to narrow, he said that every vote should count and he's not expected to block a recount. DeSantis has said little about the recount and is instead proceeding as if he won the election, appointing a transition team and preparing to take office in January.\n\nHours after the recount was announced, Gillum withdrew his concession.\n\n\"I am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call we count every single vote,\" Gillum wrote on Twitter Saturday afternoon.\n\nChris O'Meara/AP\n\nThe battle for Nelson's Senate seat has been much more heated, with both sides filing lawsuits. Scott has said Nelson is trying to steal the election, while Nelson is accusing Scott of trying to stop elections officials from counting every ballot.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also weighed in on Florida's close elections.\n\nTrump took Scott's side on Friday, telling reporters that the federal government could get involved and adding: \"all of the sudden they are finding votes out of nowhere.\"\n\n\"What's going on in Florida is a disgrace,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Long lines, broken machines, and gun scares \u2014 here are the reported problems voters are experiencing during the midterms\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, and thus giving Bush the presidency.\n\nFlorida was mocked for the way it handled the infamous 2000 recount, especially since there was no uniform process then on how to proceed. That has changed, with Congress passing a clear procedure on how a recount should be conducted.\n\nFlorida is also conducting a hand recount in a third statewide race.

Kuo also predicts a model with a 5.8-inch OLED screen, which is the same size the current iPhone XS uses.\n\nThere are several reasons for the antenna change, according to Kuo, including that Apple has lower bargaining power against the current LCP suppliers and that the new technology can have equal performance to the LCP technology. Another point he made is that the new MPI technology will support the high-frequency bands needed for so-called \"5G\" or millimeter wave connectivity.\n\nFrom the note:\n\nThe estimation for LCP antenna shipments of new iPhone models will dip at least 70% YoY in 2H19. In total, six LCP antennae are currently being equipped in 2H18 new iPhone models (XS Max, XS, and XR). We predict that 2H19 new iPhone models, including the new 6.5\" OLED, 5.8\" OLED, and 6.1\" LCD models, will adopt four MPI antennae and two LCP antennae. We believe that the two LCP antennae of 2H19 new iPhone models will be shipped exclusively by the Japanese supplier thanks to its better vertical integration capability.\n\nKuo is widely known for predicting Apple products before they launch, with a focus on parts-suppliers that sell to Apple.", "Recording and publishing videos of riders is against the rules for Uber and Lyft drivers, the companies have reaffirmed, after several high-profile incidents garnered headlines and privacy concerns in recent weeks.\n\nThe issue came to light once again at the end of October, after a v ideo circulated of Ottawa Senators hockey players bad-mouthing an assistant coach for the organization. \"If you actually do pay attention, he doesn't ever teach you anything,\" defenseman Chris Wideman said if the coach. Caught by a dashboard camera in Arizona, the video resulted in an uproar from the club, which urged a Canadian newspaper to take down the video saying it violated privacy laws.\n\nNew guidelines were put into place by Uber at the end of September, t he Associated Press reported, and were in effect at the time of the video's publication, a company spokesperson confirmed to the wire service.

Among the passengers recorded were Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell, drunk college students, and more. Often times, passengers' names could be heard on the recordings.\n\nIn a high profile incident of a driver recording and publishing video of a passenger, Uber's former CEO Travis Kalanick was taped lecturing a driver about taking responsibility for his problems.\n\nState laws for recording vary by state to state. Arizona, in the instance of the hockey players, is a \"one-party\" state, meaning that recording is legal provided at least one of the parties involved has knowledge of the surveillance.\n\n38 states share Arizona's one-party rules, while 12 require the consent of all parties, according to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.

I researched the specs, saved up, and waited until Apple refreshed its laptops with the latest Intel chips, so I wouldn't be buying old technology.\n\nReader, it was expensive. I loaded it up with lots of bells and whistles, including an upgraded processor, additional RAM, and extra storage space. I had owned my last MacBook Air for over six years, so I was ready to spread the roughly $2,000 cost over a long period of time.\n\nAnd now, just over a year later, I regret my purchase. It's not really a knock on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar \u2014 although there are issues \u2014 it's just that the new MacBook Air is the right machine for what I need to do, and I'm frustrated that there was no similar option when I needed a new Mac.\n\nNow, I've got an expensive laptop that I'm not completely satisfied with that I expected to own through 2023, and my wandering eye is looking towards Apple's latest and greatest.\n\nRead more:Hands-on with Apple's new redesigned MacBook Air: This could be the laptop that Apple fans have been waiting for\n\nThe new MacBook Air. Kif Leswing\n\nA few issues\n\nIt's not that the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is a bad machine \u2014 I've worked on it, traveled with it, and generally used it heavily, as I expected when I purchased it.\n\nBut I shouldn't have to deal with daily annoyances on what is a premium laptop.\n\nLet's start with the Touch Bar.\n\nI dislike it. I wish it weren't on my laptop. I frequently control iTunes through the function keys, and the touchscreen simply doesn't provide the same feedback as a button. I hit mute all the time when I'm in meetings to make sure my music doesn't start playing and embarrass me. These are buttons I press perhaps 30 times a day or more.\n\nIt's also really easy on the Touch Bar to accidentally activate a key, whether it's Siri (right above backspace!) or the screen brightness. It also frustrated me that I have to look at the Touch Bar to determine what I'm doing, because by default, it changes from app to app. There's a setting that basically turns it into the old keys, but even then, it's just a less effective version of what I had on my laptop in 2011.\n\nThe MacBook Pro with Touch Bar also has disappointing battery life \u2014 about four hours, in my experience. It's bad enough that when working in the field and covering events like Apple's iPhone launch, I frequently need to plug-in before the day is done. My 2011 MacBook Air had better battery life.\n\nOne place where that energy is going is heat: My MacBook Pro with Touch Bar gets extremely hot. It's too hot to use on my lap or in bed. I've worried that it's too hot to put directly on my dining room table.\n\nFinally, my MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has the \"sticky key\" problem that's led to a slew of stories and even class-action lawsuits. The \"1\" key sticks and sometimes types two 1's when I only mean to press it once. The spacebar sometimes doesn't register.\n\nIt's a problem. Apple says it will fix the sticky keys free-of-charge, but that's time and effort I'll need to spend.\n\niFixit\n\nBut the MacBook Air solves all these problems\n\nEnter the new MacBook Air, which went on sale this past week. It appears to be the device that I wanted last year, when I bought my MacBook Pro.\n\nFor example, although it has Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanner \u2014 a nice feature \u2014 it doesn't have the Touch Bar, bringing back my beloved media controls and escape key.\n\nIn terms of battery life, Apple says the MacBook Air can get up to 12 hours on a single charge. That might be optimistic, given that Apple boasts 10 hours for the model I have that usually runs out of battery in half the time, but it's a step in the right direction.\n\nAnd it has an improved keyboard that should address the sticky key issues I've experienced. Apple even highlighted it at its launch event in Brooklyn. \"The new MacBook Air has our latest-generation keyboard with keys that offer four times the stability over the previous generation, creating a modern keyboard with a more precise and responsive typing experience,\" an Apple official said at the launch.\n\nA teardown from iFixit shows that these keys have a plastic piece inside the keys that should cut down on crumbs and other debris getting inside the keys.\n\nWhile the price \u2014 starting at $1199 \u2014 isn't that far off from what I paid for mine, especially after upgrading the storage and RAM, it's hard to not feel buyer's remorse.\n\nThe MacBook Air does still have some shortcomings compares to the Pro \u2014 it has a less powerful Intel chip, for example. But I don't really need massive processor power.\n\nKif Leswing\n\nOf course, it's not Apple's fault that every year it comes out with new computers that are better than the last year's models. That's how the business works.\n\nBut I think a little bit of my annoyance is due to the fact that all of these changes could've been made in 2017. People were complaining about these issues with the MacBook Pro back then. Apple never said it was preparing a new computer that addressed the issues \u2014 it never talks about upcoming products.\n\nWhich left me in a sticky situation in the summer of 2017. It wasn't the right time to buy Apple's best 13-inch laptop, as it turns out the next year's model ended up being what I wanted.\n\nWhile it's great that Apple has fixed many consumer complaints with its main laptop line, it highlights that computer purchases are big items that people plan to use for years, unlike phones, which have a two to three year lifespan. And people who end up buying lemons are stuck with them for a long time.\n\nPeople who now buy the new MacBook Air seem happy, and are likely to say they're satisfied with their purchase. But by not having a reliable release schedule and a roadmap for future updates, there's a chance that some people \u2014 like me \u2014 will end up in a generation of customers who are stuck with a laptop they're not completely happy with.", "Tweeting from his trip to Europe, President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of California forestry policies, appearing to once again blame forest mismanagement for the trio of deadly wildfires in California that have burned tens of thousands of acres, displaced thousands, and left over 20 dead.\n\n\"With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California. Get Smart!\" Trump wrote early Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, he offered a more pointed critique.\n\n\"There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor,\" he said early Saturday. \"Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\"\n\nTom Bonnicksen, a retired forestry expert and fire researcher, told the San Francisco Chronicle that indeed, a lack of forest management was partly to blame for the fires' intense heat and rapid spread.\n\n\"There are millions and millions and millions of dollars going into fighting fires,\" Bonnicksen said, \"but there are not millions and millions and millions of dollars going into preventing the fires.\"\n\nThat lack of oversight has left forests with an overabundance of smaller trees and shrubbery, which can be among the first vegetation to fuel a fire, while larger trees take much longer to return.\n\nA healthy forest, experts told the paper, should have 60-80 trees per acre, while the forests around Paradise \u2014 home to 27,000 people that is now completely charred\u2014 have as much as 2,000 per acre.\n\nBut the blame doesn't lie entirely, or even mostly, on the state. According to a 2015 Congressional Research Service report, the federal government manages over 40% of California's land.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection manages over 30%, according to the Sacramento Bee.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has blamed forest management for deadly wildfires. Earlier this year, when the deadly Carr Fire killed eight people near the town of Redding, California, he tweeted that the disasters were made worse by \"bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized.\"\n\nIn Northern California, the Camp Fire has grown at a pace of 80 football fields per minute after starting Thursday morning. Over 20 people have been found dead as a result of the fire. More than 6,700 structures were destroyed. It is now considered the most destructive wildfire in California history in terms of the number of structures destroyed.\n\nTo the south, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, two smaller fires also started Thursday and are now creating havoc. The Woolsey and Hill Fires are burning through parts of Ventura and LA counties. The flames have threatened the homes of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and shut down stretches of the 101 freeway.\n\nAs of 7:00 p.m. PT Saturday, the blaze had burned 105,000 acres and was 20% contained. The Woolsey fire had burned 83,275 acres and was 5% contained.\n\nMore coverage of the California fires:", "When Leilani Farha paid a visit to San Francisco in January, she knew the grim reputation of the city's homeless encampments. In her four years as the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Adequate Housing, Farha has visited the slums of Mumbai, Delhi, Mexico City, Jarkarta, and Manila. The crisis in San Francisco, she said, is comparable to these conditions.\n\nWhile New York City and Los Angeles have the highest numbers of homeless people in the US, San Francisco has the highest rate of street homelessness nationwide. On any given night, more than 4,300 citizens sleep without a roof over their heads.\n\nBut not even this knowledge could prepare Farha for what she witnessed in January.\n\nIn the city's core, homeless residents were denied basic access to water, toilets, and sanitation facilities. There were piles of trash and scattered feces on the ground. In the neighboring camps in Oakland, rats dug through the mud and families huddled outside in the cold. The experience, she said, shook her to her core.\n\n\"The idea that a government would deny people those services ... when they have nowhere else to go suggests a kind of cruelty that is unsurpassed,\" Farha told Business Insider. \"It's an attempt to erase people. Worse than erase \u2014 I can only use the word annihilate. It is a denial of someone's humanity.\"\n\nThe visit led to a report in which she described San Francisco's crisis as a human rights violation. The language may sound grave \u2014 but so is the crisis.\n\nSan Francisco's homeless are often victims of hard times\n\nAt one point on her trip, Farha encountered a young man living underneath a highway underpass, cooking quesadillas on a small stove with an open flame.\n\nRead more: UN report: San Francisco's 'cruel and inhuman' homelessness crisis is a human rights violation\n\n\"The last time I had seen someone cooking on the sidewalk like that was in India, with the pavement dwellers there, and here I am in San Francisco in a state with the sixth largest GDP in the world,\" said Farha.\n\nShe asked the man about how he came to be homeless, and found that he had traveled from the Midwest after his mother died and his family broke down.\n\n\"I think he was in the midst of developing a psychosocial disability from the trauma of being on the streets,\" she said.\n\nA homeless woman sits with her belongings after the city cleared out a homeless camp that was deemed a health hazard. Ben Margot/AP\n\nWhile many homeless residents in California are native to the area, the man's story is relatively common. Farha said most of the homeless residents she met in San Francisco were victims of hard times.\n\n\"They were working and then their apartment building got sold to someone, the investor raised the rents, the person couldn't afford it anymore, they couch surfed for a while, and then they hit the street,\" she said.\n\nHer comments echo the understanding among homeless residents and advocacy organizations like the National Coalition for the Homeless, which attributes homelessness to \"a complex set of circumstances that require people to choose between food, shelter, and other basic needs.\"\n\nA crisis of open air drug markets, discarded needles, and poop piles\n\nSan Francisco's crisis of open air drug markets, discarded needles, and piles of poop on the sidewalk dates back to the nation's neo-liberal housing policies in the 1980s, according to Farha.\n\nThese policies allowed the private sector to wrest control of investments in the affordable housing market, while the government slowly retreated. In 1986, President Reagan signed a housing tax credit that gave big corporations more oversight over low-income housing. By the 2000s, companies were selling off social housing \u2014 dubbed \"housing of last resort\" \u2014 for major profits.\n\n\"It's very hard for a city to compete against a private equity firm in terms of buying up land,\" Farha said. \"Private equity firms have such a huge amount of capital at their disposal. They call them vultures for a reason. They can go in and use their power and wealth and buy up a huge amount of property very quickly.\"\n\nAfter the global financial crisis in 2008, firms like Blackstone and Goldman Sachs began purchasing single-family dwellings and charging high rents, rendering them unaffordable for most residents. These properties were then bundled together so that shareholders effectively became landlords.\n\nIn the current market, investors in cities across the country frequently buy units and flip them into short-term rentals on services like HomeAway and Airbnb. All the while, the world's wealthy billionaires are scooping up luxury apartments, creating a demand for high-end real estate.\n\nTo make sense of the San Francisco crisis, Farha has had to sift through this winding history. \"I've had to get my head around all this stuff just to understand homelessness,\" she said.\n\nResident blame tech companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook\n\nMany residents have been quick to blame San Francisco's housing crisis on major tech companies like Google, Intel, Apple, Facebook, and Twitter. As early as 2013, San Franciscans took to protesting the private buses that shuttle Google workers from their homes in the city to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters.\n\nThe protestors have even come up with a name for the massive influx of high-tech firms: \"techsploitation.\" In May, protestors in the Mission District \u2014 home to a number of the city's homeless residents \u2014 stood outside chanting the phrase, \"Sweep tech not tents.\"\n\nHomeless people camp in front of a shuttered restaurant in San Francisco. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThough Farha acknowledges the stark contrast between the city's multi-billion-dollar tech firms and residents sleeping on the streets, she doesn't think techies are exclusively to blame.\n\n\"I absolutely do not want to only point the finger at the big tech firms,\" she said. \"I think they actually come to the table late on this.\"\n\nEven so, she said, companies with massive amounts of wealth have a responsibility to share it.\n\nIn early November, Farha praised Salesforce chairman Marc Benioff's decision to support Proposition C, a controversial ballot measure in San Francisco that will tax the city's largest corporations to fund services for the homeless. The measure passed on Tuesday, but was just shy of a two-thirds majority, meaning it could be stalled by legal proceedings for years to come.\n\nIn a New York Times editorial, Benioff said homelessness was an even bigger threat to his business than a \"small tax\" because \"companies can truly thrive only when our communities succeed as well.\"\n\nHousing is a human right\n\nAt least one key player in California has taken note of Farha's concerns. After releasing her report in September, Farha received a call from Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who wanted to start a dialogue about addressing the Bay Area homelessness crisis.\n\nDespite the complicated nature of the issue, Farha isn't short on solutions. But first, she said, people have to understand that housing isn't a commodity \u2014 it's a human right.\n\n\"No international human rights treaty codifies the right to gold, but several codify the right to housing,\" said Farha. \"That's because housing goes to the core of what it means to live in dignity. You can't live in dignity without decent housing.\"\n\nUnder international human rights law, governments are required \"to apply the maximum of available resources to upgrading informal settlements\" like slums, shanty towns, and homeless encampments.\n\nFor Farha, these resources include taxes like Proposition C that go toward identifying and addressing the root causes of homelessness. It also means getting rid of forced evictions from homeless camps, adopting inclusionary zoning laws, and offering skills training programs for homeless residents. In the past, Farha has also criticized laws that prohibit the homeless from living out of their vehicles.\n\n\"It's not to say that we want to bring down capitalism,\" Farha said. Instead, she said, the human rights obligation lies with the government, which is responsible for regulating private actors.\n\nOne of her dreams as Special Rapporteur is to get people to understand the role of government in homelessness.\n\nIf a person is walking along the street and sees someone homeless, it's okay to think whatever you want, she said. \"But also think, 'That homeless person represents my government's failure to implement the right to adequate housing.'\"", "It was the best of times.

But as D'Agostino wrote on Business Insider, \"Being fired and taking a year off has provided me with the space to get truly comfortable with not having my identity tied to an occupation.\" Instead, D'Agostino spent time traveling with his family.\n\nMeanwhile, Sallie Krawcheck, the founder and CEO of Ellevest, has spoken about getting fired from her position as head of Merrill Lynch's global wealth management division at Bank of America.\n\nOn an episode of the podcast Radiate, Krawcheck said, \"It really is about how you define yourself.

Analysts and economists say the president may even double down on the fight with Beijing.\n\n\"China trade tensions will continue and possibly worsen,\" said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at research and trading firm Compass Point. \"We believe the electoral split-decision will result in President Trump's trade rhetoric \u2014 especially with China \u2014 becoming more bellicose in the weeks ahead.\"\n\nFor his part, Trump suggested a possible deal with China during a post-midterm press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"We're going to try and make a deal with China because I want to have great relationships with President Xi, as I do, and also with China,\" Trump said. Trump and Xi are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit at the end of November.\n\nBut in the same press conference, Trump touted the amount of money generated by tariffs on roughly $250 billion of Chinese imports. Meanwhile, the rest of his administration has been aggressively going after Beijing despite the president's recent suggestions of a possible deal.\n\nBoltansky noted that the complexity of the disagreements between the US and China, which leaves little hope for a quick deal.

The party helped pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, in the 1990s. Even President Barack Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership received the bulk of its congressional support from Republicans.\n\nDemocrats have been historically more skeptical of free-trade deals, and many party members have been sympathetic to Trump's tough talk on China.\n\nThe Democratic House triumph will also leave Trump with few policy options to focus his attention, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.\n\n\"The President is likely to focus his attention on areas where his executive powers give him more leeway to set the agenda, such as trade policy,\" Knightley said. \"This suggests that he is likely to continue pushing hard on China to make concessions that will contribute to getting the bilateral trade deficit lower and do more to protect US intellectual property rights.\"\n\nThe trade war is a concern for economists who say the new duties will increase costs for US businesses and consumers. Ultimately, economists predict that a protracted trade war with China could cause US economic growth to slow \u2014 and in the worst-case scenario push the country into a recession.\n\nTrump's trade war has been conducted almost exclusively using executive powers enacted by various acts of Congress. For instance, the China tariffs were imposed under the auspices of the Trade Act of 1974. This means that even if they wanted to, Democrats have few options to slow down the trade war's escalation.\n\n\"We expect Trump to lean in heavily on trade \u2014 it is one of the few unilateral policies he can enact in a now gridlocked Washington,\" said Chris Krueger, a policy strategist at Cowen Washington Research Group.", "He'd taken 10 days off work to canvas for Rose, going door to door for days to introduce Staten Islanders and South Brooklyn residents to the candidate.\n\nLike many of the volunteers for Rose who I met on November 6, he'd had a handful of hours of sleep the night before, but he was quick to smile and greet all who walked past him.

That's how much Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, made in just 24 hours on November 11, 2017.\n\nThat's more than the total online US sales from both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Combined.\n\nIt happened during an unofficial Chinese holiday called: Singles' Day. But what is Alibaba, what is \"Singles' Day,\" and how did they make so much money so quickly?\n\nSingles' Day literally translates to \"Bare Sticks Holiday.\" A reference to the Chinese expression: \"bare branches.\" The expression refers to bachelors who aren't adding \"branches\" to the family tree.\n\nNow, all of this is rooted in China's one-child policy. Implemented between 1978 and 1980, it was intended to curb the country's overpopulation problem. But the policy had unintended blowback.\n\nChina now has a massive gender imbalance. By 2020, it's projected that men will outnumber females by at least 30 million. Hence, \"Singles' Day.\"\n\nFrom this national turmoil, the unofficial holiday was born at this university. It's a day that was initially meant for single men to party with other single friends.\n\nThough, fast forward to 2009. Alibaba's CEO, Daniel Zhang, sees a business opportunity to co-opt the unofficial holiday in an attempt to drum up more online sales.\n\nIn China, spikes in shopping sales were common in late September, before China's National Day.

And it looks like it's just going to get even bigger.", "By the numbers, Tesla is getting bigger in a hurry. The company should deliver more than twice as many vehicles as it did last year, and its financials are showing one stunning area of improvement, as revenue swells to historic levels.\n\nBut, also by the numbers, Tesla continues to punch far above its weight in terms of its actual physical presence in the global auto industry. It has one car factory and one partially completed battery factory, in California and Nevada, respectively. Its total manufacturing capacity is roughly 500,000 annually, while the rest of the industry in the US alone can do 14 million. Its market capitalization is higher than Ford or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nThis outsized impression of success has led numerous Tesla boosters to attribute a massive first-mover advantage to the company, arguing that Tesla somehow has a huge lead and that everybody else will need to play catch-up.\n\nThere are two major problems with that case. The first is that the market for electric vehicles is currently rather tiny. Tesla has established itself as a force to be reckoned with in the automotive equivalent of the solid-gold fluegelhorn market. Solid-gold flugelhorns could become really, really big in the next few decades. But for now, well ... they're sold-gold flugelhorns, and the auto industry is far from sure that they constitute a true mass market anytime soon.\n\nRead more: I tried Tesla's new Autopilot feature that helps navigate during highway driving to see if it's helpful \u2014 here's the verdict\n\nThe second is that Tesla will somehow get a pass on spending to remain competitive. My view is that Tesla has the potential to fill a large role in the middle of the US market, sales-wise. But to get there, it will require new factories, and it will have to build them at 21st-century prices.\n\nAddicted to reinventing the wheel\n\nThe Model X SUV. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nBeyond that, Tesla and CEO Elon Musk are sort of addicted to reinventing the wheel. A massive investment in automated assembly at its Fremont plant failed in 2017-2018. Meanwhile, GM upgraded its Orion factory in Michigan to build the Chevy Bolt electric car by reinforcing an existing assembly line to handle the heavier weight of vehicles with electric batteries and by adding a battery pack entry point and installation process. That was about it. And the same line still builds cars with gas tanks.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that the traditional car business doesn't consider electrification to be that big a deal. Electric vehicles have been around, in one form or another, for a century. Tesla under Musk rebranded the electric car, making it sexy and fast rather than virtuous and underpowered. But swapping gas-engines for electric propulsion isn't a heavy lift. Up to this point, the industry has avoided it because EVs cost a lot more than gas vehicles, achieving long-range with EVs is challenging, and the recharging infrastructure is skimpy. Also, consumer demand has been slight.\n\nRegulatory pressures and a rapidly expanding auto market in China are forcing carmakers to rethink EVs, but the economics are anything but worked out. No one is really sure if EV net profit margins will materialize, even though Tesla often touts its 20%-ish gross margins.\n\nFor this reason, two big pivots have occurred in the more futuristic area of automobility. Number one is the shift to self-driving cars. This is the electric car of the moment, as compelling as EVs were ten years ago. Billions of dollars in value are now being attached to serious autonomous efforts from GM's Cruise division and Alphabet's Waymo.\n\nMobility-as-a-service is driving business activity\n\nA Chevy Bolt outfitted with Cruise self-driving technology. GM\n\nNumber two is mobility as a service. Much of the M&A activity in the industry is now around alternatives to the automobile and is focused on the highly urbanized environments of the future, which could be highly car-unfriendly. Ford just bought a San Francisco scooter startup, Spin, and has already acquired a ride-sharing service in Chariot. GM has developed a ride-hailing/sharing service, Maven. And various other car companies are doubtlessly planning to use the massive amount of cash they've raked in selling big SUVs for the past few years to make their own moves.\n\nTesla has been talking about a networked transportation service, but it doesn't yet have anything. Additionally, its very traditional own-lease model for its cars is somewhat incompatible with the notion that customers will want to allow strangers to borrow vehicles that go for $50,000-$150,000. There's nothing quite like getting your Model 3 back with a back seat full of In-N-Out wrappers to turn you off sharing.\n\nMake no mistake, Tesla is an impressive car company, the first new player to come along in decades. But it doesn't have an infinitely flexible business model, and if anybody is going to play catch-up on mobility-as-a-service, it's probably going to be Tesla. The company might not succeed. And guess what? That wouldn't be a bad thing. Tesla has upped its electric-car game considerably since 2014. That should be good enough.

Investors could simply have bought these growth stocks, closed their eyes, and reaped some of the most bountiful returns of this cycle.\n\nBig tech has faltered of late, however, as investors worry that regulators are coming to prune their growth, which by itself is showing signs of peaking. This means value stocks may fall into favor again as investors seek alternatives, according to Andrew Lapthorne, the head of equity quantitative research at Societe Generale.\n\n\"Given the increasing bearish mood of global markets and the historically low current valuations of the value strategy after long periods of underperformance, conditions appear to be ripe for the long-awaited value resurgence,\" Lapthorne said in a note.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests that value stocks work best during the early stages of an economic cycle. That's because investors scarred by the preceding crash become more discerning of valuations and suss out discounts. It further holds that value stocks suffer during downturns as consumer demand falters.\n\nLapthorne concluded that there's more to value than these widely held assumptions. His study of their performance dating back to the 1920s indicates that value is often a resilient factor during episodes of market volatility. Furthermore, he observed that events associated with their outperformance often overlap with periods when risk assets and strategies underperform.\n\nThe chart below illustrates how value's performance stacked up next to the S&P 500 when the broader index fell by more than 10%.\n\nSociete Generale\n\nOn the face of it, value stocks had a mixed track record. They sank with the broader market, went negative during 11 of the 24 episodes, and remained positive during 10 of them.\n\nBut Lapthorne's closer examination produced two key findings. First, value rallies were stronger than the worst value downturns, with the dotcom bubble and 1980s inflation crisis among the blowout episodes.\n\nSecondly, the average value performance across these events was a -2.9% annualized drawdown, versus a 30% slump for the S&P 500. Relatedly, the average performance of value stocks was 2.4% per episode, compared to -25% for the S&P 500.\n\nEven nine-plus years into this historic bull market, it's still any investor's guess when exactly the next crash will happen, although many think it will be sooner rather than later. It's also uncertain whether (or by how much) value stocks will outperform the broader market in the next downturn.\n\nLapthorne's message despite this uncertainty is that value has proven to be a hedge during regime shifts from low volatility to high volatility.\n\n\"The preponderance of our extensive research supports a robust value strategy to be more global than regional, neutral with respect to sector/industry exposures, but flexible with respect to country tilts, and prefers size weightings to capitalizations,\" Lapthorne said.", "LONDON \u2014 Theresa May's government refused to rule out medicine shortages under a no deal Brexit during a confidential meeting with shocked medical industry representatives last month, Business Insider can reveal.\n\nAround two dozen representatives from the medical and pharmaceutical industry were told by civil servants from the Department for Exiting the European Union, that ministers could not guarantee that all medicines currently provided by the NHS will be available to patients in the event of there being no Brexit deal.\n\n\"They aren't guaranteeing against medicine shortages in a no deal \u2014 it's pretty alarming stuff,\" an industry figure who attended the meeting on the week of October 15 told BI.\n\n\"The government rep stuck to the line that if all stakeholders do what is required, then they believe that patients will be protected.

However, industry figures are concerned about medicines which require special conditions like cool temperatures, and medicines with shorter shelf-lives that cannot be stockpiled and may have to be flown in.\n\nMartin Sawer, Executive Director at Healthcare Distribution Association, told MPs last month that it would take \"more than a year\" to build large cold chain (temperature-controlled) warehouses, while Brexit is five months away.\n\nPharmaceutical companies are working with the government to scope airline capacity for getting these drugs to the UK in the event of a no-deal, but are worried about being in competition with other industries, like food.\n\nA government spokesperson told BI: \"The Government is confident of reaching a deal with the EU that benefits patients and the NHS. However, as a responsible Government we are also preparing for a range of potential outcomes in the unlikely event of a no deal.\n\n\"As part of our contingency planning, we continue to work closely with pharmaceutical companies and storage providers to ensure the continued supply of critical drug and medicine supplies.\"\n\n'The honest answer is we don't know'\n\nperfectlab/Shutterstock Jane Summerfield \u2014 who leads Hogan Lovells' life sciences regulatory practice in London \u2014 told BI this week that the government was \"still working out\" how much capacity was needed to stockpile medicines, and how to do it.\n\n\"They're far enough down that process to know that additional capacity is needed, and actions are ongoing to identify warehousing on both sides of the channel, but there isn't much information coming out to actually answer that question. The honest answer is we don't know,\" Summerfield said.\n\nShe explained that while some medicines can be stockpiled for six weeks as the government has recommended, other \"very complex\" medicines cannot, and could be in short supply if there is no Brexit deal in five months time.\n\n\"If it is a medicine like gene therapy, you can't just stockpile, that's not how the product works. If it's cold chain (temperature-controlled) storage, you don't necessarily have the right capacity and conditions to do that.\n\n\"Some have a very short shelf life. So warehousing works for some clients but others are finding it really difficult.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told ITV's Robert Peston this week that the government was building extra \"refrigeration capacity\" for stockpiling medicines which require cool temperatures to prepare for no deal.\n\nHancock also revealed last month that he has invited private companies to provide additional storage. \"We have issued today an invitation to tender for additional storage capacity,\" the minister told MPs.\n\nAnother issue facing pharmaceutical companies is the costly and time-consuming customs checks that would emerge on the UK-EU border if there is no Brexit deal next year.\n\nAline Doussin \u2014 a lawyer who heads Hogan Lovells' UK trade team and advises firms on Brexit planning \u2014 told BI that \"at this stage, there are no solutions to the customs issues\" facing pharmaceutical companies in a no deal scenario.\n\n\"That [customs] is the question that even us as trade lawyers cannot answer,\" Doussin said.\n\n\"We advise clients to get a certified trusted trade scheme that puts them in the priority queue to get their products moving faster across customs borders.

The two regions are home to the country's Uighur and Tibetan ethnic minorities, who Beijing has attempted to muzzle.\n\nDuring Meng's tenure, China submitted multiple \"red notices\" \u2014 Interpol arrest warrants \u2014 for dissidents around the world.\n\nRead more: Barging into your home, threatening your family, or making you disappear: Here's what China does to people who speak out against them\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping speaks at Interpol's general assembly in Beijing in 2017, one year after Meng was elected to preside over the organization.

Non \u00e8 cos\u00ec.\n\nQuesto \u00e8 ancora un iPad, come quello che hai comprato anni fa. S\u00ec, \u00e8 pi\u00f9 veloce e pi\u00f9 carino di prima. Ma non dovrebbe essere scambiato per un computer da lavoro. Saresti un lavoratore meno efficiente se scegliessi un iPad Pro per lavorare invece dei numerosi portatili e computer standard.\n\nL\u2019iPad Pro fallisce nelle attivit\u00e0 di base\n\nLa prima cosa che ho fatto con l\u2019iPad Pro \u2013 oltre a scattare foto \u2013 \u00e8 stato provare a scrivere un articolo. So che pu\u00f2 realizzare film e libri, ma volevo verificare l\u2019elemento \u201cPro\u201d.\n\nHo finito per scrivere questo articolo sulle mie prime impressioni sull\u2019iPad Pro sul dispositivo stesso. Ma mi sono imbattuto immediatamente in alcuni ostacoli.\n\nSelezionare il testo era molto complicato. Il primo campanello d\u2019allarme per me \u00e8 stato quando ho provato a selezionare una frase per evidenziarla. Non ho potuto selezionare la frase. Stavo indicando l\u2019area giusta con il mio dito, ma l\u2019area evidenziata continuava ad allargarsi su tutto schermo, evidenziando interi paragrafi.\n\nNon potevo credere a quanto tempo avessi passato cercando di selezionare una singola frase. Non ho mai avuto problemi a selezionare il testo su un laptop, perch\u00e9 i mouse ed i trackpad sono ancora molto pi\u00f9 precisi delle dita e dei touchscreen.\n\nIl multitasking sull\u2019iPad Pro \u00e8 risultato incostante e meno efficiente rispetto a un normale computer. Una delle cose pi\u00f9 comuni che faccio quando scrivo un articolo per Business Insider \u00e8 aggiungere una foto. Come nella maggior parte dei siti web, si preme un pulsante \u201ccarica\u201d e si pu\u00f2 cercare tra i file o trascinarli in un\u2019area evidenziata.\n\nSu un Mac, aggiungere una foto a un sito Web \u00e8 una procedura in tre fasi:\n\napri il browser, apri Finder e trascina il file dal Finder nel browser.\n\nSull\u2019iPad Pro, avevo bisogno di:\n\naprire Safari, scorrere dalla parte inferiore dello schermo per attivare il dock (barra contenente le icone delle applicazioni situate nella parte bassa dello schermo), aprire l\u2019app Foto dal dock per attivare Split View, quindi trascinare e rilasciare la foto che volevo da un\u2019app all\u2019altra.\n\nUn passo in pi\u00f9, in ogni caso. Ma trascinare e rilasciare non sempre funziona. Metto il dito su una foto per selezionarla, ma quando l\u2019ho trascinata nella seconda app, \u00e8 cambiata in un\u2019altra foto che non avevo selezionato. Questo comportamento potrebbe essere un bug, ma \u00e8 successo ogni volta che ho provato ad aggiungere una foto.\n\nAnche il caricamento di una foto sul sito Web \u00e8 stato pi\u00f9 lento rispetto al mio MacBook Pro che ha 4 anni. E alcune foto che ho caricato ruotano automaticamente di 180 gradi. Nessun problema; mi era gi\u00e0 successo sul mio Mac. Ma modificare e salvare la foto con l\u2019orientamento corretto, che di solito funziona sul Mac, non ha funzionato sull\u2019iPad Pro.\n\nNiente ha funzionato e non c\u2019era modo di correggere la foto, a meno che non l\u2019avessi fatto sul mio Mac. Ed \u00e8 proprio cosa ho fatto: ho messo via il mio nuovo iPad Pro e ho finito il mio lavoro sul mio MacBook.\n\n\u00c8 difficile giustificare un dispositivo costoso quanto un computer da lavoro, che per\u00f2 non lo \u00e8.\n\nIl mio nuovo iPad Pro, con Apple Pencil e Smart Keyboard. Dave Smith/Business Insider\n\nUna grande parte della mia delusione per l\u2019iPad Pro \u00e8 stato il prezzo.\n\nIl mio primo iPad, l\u2019iPad di terza generazione e il primo con display Retina, aveva un prezzo di partenza di $ 500. Cinquecento dollari sono davvero tanti! E questo senza contare AppleCare e tutti gli accessori, come una custodia.\n\nMa anche confrontando questo nuovo iPad Pro con il mio iPad Air del 2013, mi sono reso conto di quanto poco fosse cambiato. Il nuovo dispositivo \u00e8 ovviamente pi\u00f9 veloce, ma entrambi funzionano allo stesso modo.\n\nL\u2019iPad Pro non ha alcun vantaggio funzionale rispetto a nessun altro iPad. Tutti gli iPad usano lo stesso sistema operativo, iOS.\n\nNon \u00e8 che l\u2019iPad Pro abbia un vantaggio speciale, a parte i chip pi\u00f9 veloci. Supporta Apple Pencil, che si usa raramente a meno che non sei un artista, e la Smart Keyboard, che \u00e8 estremamente costosa considerando che equivale a una tastiera rumorosa con magneti al suo interno. Questo \u00e8 tutto. L\u2019iPad Pro \u00e8 fondamentalmente un invito a spendere soldi per provare un iPad di lusso \u2013 divertente, certo, ma s\u00ec, non \u00e8 un computer da lavoro.\n\nInsisto che l\u2019iPad Pro non \u00e8 un vero computer da lavoro, perch\u00e9 anche provare a eseguire i compiti pi\u00f9 elementari mi \u00e8 parso deludente e mi ha costretto a utilizzare un laptop.\n\nL\u2019iPad funzioner\u00e0 sempre con iOS e iOS ha dei limiti. S\u00ec, \u00e8 facile per gli utenti da capire, con tutte quelle app che si scaricano dall\u2019App Store. Ma il sistema in s\u00e9 non \u00e8 robusto o potente quanto un sistema operativo desktop come MacOS o Windows.\n\nChe Apple definisca l\u2019iPad Pro come un dispositivo professionale, ma non consenta il suo funzionamento con un mouse o un trackpad o un dispositivo di archiviazione esterno \u00e8 quasi un insulto per i clienti che ne hanno bisogno per attivit\u00e0 professionali, come implicherebbe la sigla Pro. Se non riesco a selezionare facilmente il testo o a lavorare in multitasking, perch\u00e9 dovrei comprarlo preferendolo a un portatile?\n\nL\u2019iPad potrebbe essere incredibile, ma Apple lo sta limitando.\n\nBebeto Matthews/AP\n\nApple deve smettere di dire no alle potenziali funzioni dell\u2019iPad.\n\n\u00c8 bizzarro, perch\u00e9 questo iPad Pro aggiunge anche una Usb-C per la prima volta, il che \u00e8 quasi un segnale che questo dispositivo desidera disperatamente comunicare con altri gadget. Ma l\u2019implementazione di Apple qui non \u00e8 stata fatta in modo convinto, e si vede. Non prevedere nessun dispositivo di archiviazione o supporto esterno per accessori simili al computer danneggia l\u2019iPad Pro.\n\nProprio come nel primo iPad del 2010, il metodo di input principale per i tablet Apple \u00e8 il tuo dito. Ma Apple deve rendersi conto che le persone hanno bisogno di pi\u00f9 delle loro dita \u2013 o di una matita \u2013 per fare un lavoro professionale nel 2018.\n\nAbbiamo inventato i migliori sistemi di input per i computer anni fa; sono chiamati mouse e trackpad. Offrono ci\u00f2 che le dita non possono: la precisione. L\u2019iPad \u00e8 ancora un passo indietro, nel suo cercare di insistere sul fatto che le persone lavorino solo in un dato modo, anzich\u00e9 pensare a facilitare quel lavoro.", "On Friday, Apple announced that two of its products \u2014 the iPhone X and the 13-inch MacBook Pro (non Touch Bar) \u2014 have known hardware issues.

The women were all aged 23 to 35 when they enrolled in that study, which was designed to look at risk factors for developing benign uterine tumors, called fibroids.

If the mothers weren't available, the women were instructed to ask a relative or a close friend of the mother.\n\nAmong the questions, women were asked whether they had been fed soy formula as a baby (yes or no), how long they had been fed soy (less than a month, one to three months, four to six months), and whether the soy was introduced during the first two months after they were born (yes or no).\n\nOverall, researchers found that women who had ever been fed soy formula as babies were, at ages 18-22 years, 50 percent more likely than those not fed soy to experience moderate or severe cramping during most periods when they were not using hormonal contraception.\n\nWomen fed soy as babies were also 40 percent more likely to have used hormonal contraception at some point to alleviate menstrual pain, the study team reports in Human Reproduction.\n\nWhile the results don't explain why soy formula might be linked to painful cramping during menses, Upson has some theories. \"The link between soy formula feeding in infancy and menstrual pain in adulthood may be biologically plausible given that in the early months after birth, an infant's reproductive system continues to develop and an infant's nutrition primarily consists of breast milk and/or formula,\" Upson said in an email.\n\n\"This can lead to a substantial exposure to the components in formula, including phytoestrogens (plant compounds that are structurally similar to estrogen) in soy formula during a critical window of development.\"\n\nThere's some evidence of what can happen from animal models, Upson said. \"Data from animal studies have shown that genistein, one of the phytoestrogens in soy formula, given after birth has effects on the development of the reproductive system that persist into adulthood, including the parts of the reproductive system involved in menstrual pain.\"\n\nWhile the new research won't help women already experiencing severe cramping, Upson hopes that it will prevent another generation of women from developing the same problem.\n\n\"Given how common menstrual pain is and the impact it can have on women's lives, our findings point to the need for a greater understanding of exposures, even those that occur earlier in life, which may increase a woman's risk of experiencing menstrual pain,\" she said. \"This information can be used to inform prevention efforts to improve women's health in the future.\"\n\nSOURCE: https://bit.ly/2AXXFzk Human Reproduction, online November 9, 2018.", "By Linda Carroll\n\n(Reuters Health) - The number of people in the U.S. who have difficulty controlling sexual feelings and urges may be greater than realized, researchers say.\n\nSeven percent of women and more than 10 percent of men said they were distressed due to difficulty controlling sexual urges, feelings and behaviors, according to study results published in JAMA Network Open.\n\n\"It's a lot more people than we expected to be having difficulty controlling sexual urges and behaviors and who are feeling distressed and impaired,\" said the study's lead author, Janna Dickenson, of the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis.\n\n\"The differences between the sexes are a lot less than we would have expected, raising concerns that the difficulty in controlling sexual behavior affects more than just men,\" she added.\n\nDickenson and colleagues surveyed 2,235 people, ages 18 to 50, across all 50 states. Questions covered household income, personal details and 13 other items specifically addressing sexual urges, feelings and behaviors. Among these 13 were: \"How often have you had trouble controlling your sexual urges?\", \"How often have you felt unable to control sexual behavior?\", \"How often have you felt guilty or shameful about sexual behavior?\", \"How often have you made pledges or promises to alter your sexual behavior?\" and \"How often have your sexual activities caused financial problems for you?\"\n\nStudy volunteers were told to answer by rating each question using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very frequently). Other research has shown that a score of 35 or more indicates that the person is likely to have \"compulsive sexual behavior disorder,\" a newly designated diagnosis listed in the International Classification of Diseases, Dickenson said. The diagnosis is not one that is recognized in the reference used by U.S. psychiatrists and psychologists, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).\n\nOverall, 10.3 percent of men and 7.0 percent of women scored 35 or more. That number is higher than previous research has found, Dickenson said.\n\nDr. Robert Hudak isn't sure exactly what the new study is telling us. \"They kind of mix things up, for example, using 'impulsive' and 'compulsive' interchangeably,\" said Hudak, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pennsylvania and medical director of the Obsessive Compulsive Disorders Outpatient Program at the at Western Psychiatric Hospital at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who wasn't involved in the study.\n\nStill, Hudak allowed, \"they do find a high rate of people with some sort of distress with their sexuality. But is it impulsive, compulsive, addictive? Is it something else? You can't tell from what they did.\"\n\n\"What you can take from this research is that there are a pretty decent percentage of people who are complaining about some sort of negative feelings about their sexuality,\" Hudak said. \"And those negative feelings are leading to some distress.\"\n\nBut that wouldn't earn them any kind of diagnosis in the U.S., Hudak noted.\n\nBased on his experiences as a therapist, Thomas Plante wasn't surprised by the large numbers of people distressed by their sexuality.\n\n\"There are a lot of people in my patient population - regular folks - who really struggle with their sexual impulses,\" said Plante, a professor of psychology at Santa Clara University in California and an adjunct clinical professor of psychiatry at the Stanford University School of Medicine who also wasn't involved in the new research. \"There are folks who are engaging with sex workers when they travel. Others struggle with pornography or the temptation to step away from marital fidelity. Many take risks even when it can impact their lives.\"\n\nPlante suspects that more and more people are having trouble these days because so much temptation is at their fingertips. Just a few taps on the smart phone and pornography pops up, or an assignation that might later lead to guilt, can be arranged, he said.\n\n\"I've had a lot of patients like that,\" Plante said. \"They start out just poking around on the internet. Then they're doing it more and more. And then it becomes a problem for them. Their spouse gets all upset, or someone walks in on them.

A coalition of commercial property owners sued the city in August, saying that a simple majority vote is not enough to pass this measure and it violates state law \u2014 instead, it should be a two-thirds majority, they said.\n\nThis could also potentially affect Prop C, so the city won't spend the money until this legal dispute is resolved.

Vox's report is just the latest in a series of revelations that throw Whitaker's independence into question.\n\nOnce described as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the DOJ, Whitaker made the rounds on right-wing media over the last two years claiming without evidence, that there was \"no collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nWhile he was Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker reportedly met with Trump in the Oval Office over a dozen times. And according to The Washington Post, whenever Trump complained about the ongoing Russia investigation Whitaker \"often smiled knowingly and nodded in assent.\"\n\nHe also said in a CNN op-ed last year that Mueller had overstepped his mandate by digging into the Trump Organization's finances.\n\nAnd late Thursday, audio footage resurfaced of Whitaker claiming the \"left is trying to sow this theory that essentially Russians interfered with the US election, which has been proven false. They did not have any impact in the election.\"\n\nThe US intelligence community concluded last year that Russia mounted an elaborate campaign to meddle in the 2016 election to elevate Trump to the presidency. The assessment did not reach a conclusion about whether Russia's meddling had an impact on the results.\n\nIn another recording reported on by Mother Jones, Whitaker said the president cannot obstruct justice and can kill any investigation he wants.\n\nThe Post reported that despite Whitaker's controversial remarks about Mueller and the Russia probe, the acting attorney general has no plans to recuse himself, even if DOJ ethics officials urge him to do so. Sources also told The Post that Whitaker would likely oppose a request from Mueller to subpoena the president if it came down to it.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said he does not know Whitaker.\n\nBut in an interview with Fox & Friends last month, Trump called Whitaker \"a great guy,\" adding, \"I mean, I know Matt Whitaker.\"", "Flames are racing along the southern California coastline as firefighters work to contain the fast-moving Woolsey Fire.

Bids for this massive contract closed in October, but now that bids are being reviewed, investors in Microsoft and Amazon should pay attention, say analysts at financial firm Wedbush Securities.\n\n\"Let's just put it this way. I don't think the timing of Amazon moving its headquarters near DC is coincidental,\" Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, told Business Insider.\n\nIt's really a two-horse race for the contract, and while Amazon has been seen as the frontrunner, Microsoft has put in significant effort in the past year to narrow the race. And the implications go beyond the deal itself \u2014 it could completely transform the cloud industry, especially if Microsoft wins. An award is expected in April 2019.\n\nThis is the biggest government cloud deal ever, but winning JEDI has a domino effect. Whoever wins this contract will be well-positioned to win future government contracts \u2014 analysts reckon that there's $20 billion in cloud spending up for grabs from the government.\n\nPlus, there's a stamp of credibility \u2014 it would be hard for enterprise customers to turn down a cloud company that was selected by the federal government itself.\n\n\"Many investors have underappreciated the ripple effect of whoever gets JEDI,\" Ives said. \"Whoever gets JEDI, it's not just about the $10 billion over the last decade. There would not be a better mark of credibility than to get this deal. Investors are trying to understand, is it just an Amazon, or does Microsoft have a shot to win JEDI from the grips of [Amazon CEO Jeff] Bezos?\"\n\nDon't expect Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump to go on vacation together\n\nThat could be why Amazon is considering moving its headquarters to Virginia, analysts say. With a base of operations near Washington, DC, Amazon could boost its presence in federal circles.\n\nMicrosoft has an office in Washington, DC, as well, but if Amazon builds HQ2 in Crystal City, its massive campus with 25,000 employees would easily dwarf Microsoft.\n\n\"As Amazon looks to have their employees in the shadow of the Pentagon, JEDI is a big component of how they will build out their presence within the beltway,\" Ives said. \"To have a headquarters in and around the beltway shows that Amazon is significantly focused on their federal presence.\"\n\nRead more: As bidding closes, Amazon's cloud is the favorite to win a $10 billion defense deal.

If Microsoft wins, it would be a \"crowning achievement\" for Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\"It would have a significant ripple effect for cloud,\" Ives said. \"With DOD going to cloud with Microsoft, it's hard to argue with that sales pitch.\"\n\nJeff Bezos. AP\n\nAnd politics could be a small factor, too. It's no secret that President Donald Trump and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos aren't on the best terms, so in addition to investment in its Azure government cloud, this is where Microsoft could swoop in.\n\nAnd unlike the hesitation from Google to work with the military, Microsoft is all in, saying it will sell artificial-intelligence technologies to the Pentagon.\n\n\"It's no secret about Trump and Bezos. I don't expect them to be going on vacation together,\" Ives said. \"For Bezos and Amazon to own the cloud at DOD as the sole victor, within the beltway, there's a lot of views that would not like to see Amazon as the sole winner. There's definitely a complex political environment.\"\n\nEither way, cloud investors should keep an eye on the JEDI deal.\n\n\"For any investor in the cloud space, it should be on their radar,\" Ives said. \"It's the ripple effect it could have on the cloud landscape.\"", "One of the highest valued private companies in biotech is finally going public.\n\nModerna Therapeutics, a company developing treatments based on messenger RNA, has racked up a private valuation of $7 billion.

The design has been similar, the camera hasn't seen a major upgrade, and the battery life hasn't necessarily been such a major jump from older devices.\n\nBut now that the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max have arrived, it feels like time to consider a new phone, especially if you're on an iPhone 6S or earlier.\n\nIf you haven't bought an iPhone in the last year, however, you're going to be in for a few major changes, especially if you opt for the extra-large iPhone XS Max, which is a pretty big departure from iPhones of years past.\n\nHere are the six biggest things you'll notice when making the switch:", "Following is a transcript of the video.\n\nThis is not your typical football helmet. VICIS ZERO1 looks like a standard helmet on the outside. But when it hits something, it reacts much differently. Its innovative design is protecting football players' heads. Here's how it works.\n\nWhen hit, hard-shelled helmets stay rigid. When ZERO1 is hit, it morphs its shape. This allows it to absorb more force from a blow. The secret?\n\nLots of separate columns of padding inside the helmet. When pressure is applied, they deform and absorb the pressure. Multiple layers work together to slow impact forces. This keeps the head protected from multiple forces. The ZERO1 has a softer outer shell than a normal helmet. This slows impact forces before they reach the head and brain. ZERO1 also offers a wider field of view than traditional helmets.\n\nThe ZERO1 ranked first in the NFL/NFLPA 2017 helmet laboratory performance testing. The goal of the test was to \"determine which helmet reduced head impact severity.\" The outer shell takes a collision like a car bumper. The helmet costs $950.\n\nThe ZERO1 was worn by over 60 NFL players in 2017. Including Russell Wilson, Alex Smith, Doug Baldwin, Golden Tate, and Lamar Miller. ZERO1 was also worn by players on over 20 NCAA programs in 2017. Teams included Alabama, Georgia, Florida State, and Texas A&M. Notre Dame has announced it will give its entire roster a ZERO1 helmet in the upcoming season. Time will tell if more players adopt the ZERO1.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published on February 5, 2018.", "Republican Sen.

He's frequently contended Trump is eroding both the GOP and the country's inherent values with his bombastic approach to the presidency.\n\nThe senator has at times been applauded for defending mainstream conservatism in this regard, but critics feel he's more bark than bite given he still tends to vote in line with Trump.

It can be hard-wired, to be sure, but it also has a battery pack and works with the Ring Chime so you can use it wirelessly. That's a godsend for people who rent or are unable to hard wire a doorbell on their property.\n\nApart from the great wireless option, the Ring Video Doorbell 2 boasts a 1080p camera with two-way audio, so you can talk to people at your door even if you're not home. The camera also has motion tracking, and you can set motion zones so that it doesn't send notifications every time someone walks past your house.\n\nThere are a few downsides to the Ring doorbell, of course. Like many of the other smart doorbells in our buying guide to the best doorbells, there's no free video storage, so you have to pay to access it.

Skybridge seeks to raise $2 billion to $3 billion for the private REIT. That money will be invested across property types, such as apartments and offices, and in local infrastructure projects.\n\n\"This will be a game-changing product for SkyBridge,\" Scaramucci said. \"This will likely be bigger and more important to the firm than our current fund of funds.\"\n\nScaramucci said SkyBridge has identified $2 billion worth of pipeline projects, including real-estate development and infrastructure projects. The fund will be subadvised by EJF Capital, a $10 billion hedge fund.\n\nSkyBridge, which managed $9.6 billion as of September 30, is the latest alternatives firm to launch an opportunity-zones fund. Goldman Sachs, for example, had already been investing in economically-challenged areas through its Urban Investment Group, founded in 2001. Now, the firm is raising capital specifically for the opportunity-zones initiative.\n\nOther players include PNC Bank and real estate firms RXR Realty and Bridge Investment Group. Most of the early funds have focused on real estate, and more products are being created following further guidance from the government last month.\n\nUnder last year's tax reform, about 8,700 census tracts in all 50 states were designated as opportunity zones, set up to attract long-term investors through tax breaks on capital gains. Under the legislation, an investor can sell an asset - stock, a company, or even a wine collection - and, within 180 days, reinvest those profits into opportunity-zone-focused investments. The profits are later taxed at various levels depending on how long the capital is invested.\n\nScaramucci, who spent 10 days as the White House communications director last year, said his firm has \"tons of investor interest\" in the fund. SkyBridge's REIT will lock up investors for six years, though the full tax advantages do not come into effect until a decade of investment. The REIT can invest in projects of all sizes, even a $10 million deal, because \"we don't want to compete with behemoths\" in real estate, Scaramucci said.\n\nHis firm also considered other structures, including special purpose vehicles and private equity funds. A private REIT, however, offers the most cash-flow opportunities, with rental income turned into dividends for investors, as well as portfolio diversity and liquidity, Scaramucci said.", "President Donald Trump lashed out at French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, lambasting the French leader for saying that European countries needed to establish their own military force for defense against Russia, China, and the US.\n\n\"President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia,\" Trump tweeted on Friday. \"Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!\"\n\nTrump was responding to comments from Macron on Tuesday, when, during a visit to Verdun \u2014 site of one of the longest and bloodiest battles of World War I \u2014 he said Europeans could not be defended without a \"real European army.\"\n\nMacron's remarks came a few days before Trump was scheduled to arrive in Europe to mark the centenary of the November 11 armistice that ended World War I.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nMacron's proposal seems to align with Trump's exhortations for European countries to spend and do more to support their defense \u2014 which he has punctuated with sharply worded letters to several European leaders.\n\nBut Macron continued his comments on Tuesday by naming the US as one of the actors against which Europe may have to defend itself.\n\n\"We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America,\" Macron said on French radio.\n\nTensions between European countries and Russia have risen steadily in recent years, particularly after Moscow's annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine. China's involvement in European infrastructure and investments in the continent, while limited, is seen by some as a growing threat in light of the \"debt-trap diplomacy\" that Beijing has been accused of practicing in Asia.\n\nTensions with the US are relatively new for Europe, however. Since his campaign, Trump has expressed disdain for the NATO alliance, of which the US is a founding member.\n\nAs in his tweet Friday, the US president has criticized NATO's European members not meeting the 2%-of-GDP defense-spending goal the alliance agreed to in 2014, though they agreed it did not need to be met for a decade.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump and other NATO leaders at the opening ceremony at the 2018 NATO Summit in Brussels, July 11, 2018. Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nTrump has accused European countries of not paying their \"fair share\" toward NATO, though alliance members do not pay into a common pool for defense. (Each member does make a contribution to NATO's relatively modest direct budget.) Previous US administrations made similar criticisms of other NATO members, though Trump is much more strident.\n\nTrump has also undermined NATO in other ways. Earlier this year, he questioned the admission of Montenegro, the alliance's newest member, and suggested the US may not act to defend the Balkan country as required by NATO's collective-defense provision, Article 5.\n\nWhile others have criticized NATO's expansion since the end of the Cold War, Trump's comments were seen by many as more damaging because they suggested NATO's most powerful member would not adhere to the alliance's founding purpose.\n\nHours after Macron spoke Tuesday, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, long a vocal supporter of such a force, said an EU army was likely to be formed one day. Many in Europe are wary of such a force, however, out of concerns it could undermine NATO.\n\nOn Wednesday, the French-led European Intervention Initiative was launched after months of negotiations with Germany, which Paris wanted as a main part of the force.\n\nWhile many were skeptical of the initiative when Macron first proposed it a year ago, Trump's remarks and the looming British exit from the EU boosted support for it.

I'm Anthony Peeples. I'm a Funko Pop Collector. I'm feeling high-five fantastic, and I hope you are as well.\n\nNarrator: Funko Pops are everywhere. They're those small plastic figurines with giant heads and big round eyes. There are pops of pretty much every character you can think of. And fans are obsessed. The company did half a billion dollars in sales in 2017. And has already surpassed that in 2018. Anthony, who goes by the nickname GeekyPeeples, has taken his obsession to another level.\n\nPeeples: Funko Funatics is definitely a common term that we all use to refer to ourselves.\n\nNarrator: Anthony and his partner, Raul, have been collecting Pops since 2015. And they can be found all over their home.\n\nPeeples: They're displayed in all the various places that we can find room in our New York City apartment. We have one room that is our room that we've kind of transformed into a Pop den. My DC wall is dedicated to \"Batman the Animated Series,\" which was very important to me in my childhood growing up. I'm a big Marvel boy, so I collect a lot of the Marvel lines. I have one wall dedicated to Freddy Funko, the Funko mascot. The other wall is kind of, \"storage.\" It's a slow process so I'm building the room up.\n\nNarrator: His kitchen is decorated with Pops that are food related.\n\nPeeples: A friend of mine, he actually displays his Mr. Freeze Pops in the freezer.\n\nNarrator: And when we visited in October, his living room was decorated with Halloween-related Pops.\n\nPeeples: So all of the Pops that are horror based, or fun, or scary. And we also have Pops displayed in our bedroom.\n\nNarrator: Anthony keeps track of his Pops using several online apps. Which estimate that his collection could be worth thousands of dollars, based on market value. But the prices can change over time. His first Pop was a Storm figurine given to him as a gift from friends.\n\nPeeples: And then from there, it just took fire in side of me and I just wanted to collect as many as I can. I actually still have that Storm, it's right there on the wall. I keep it right where I can always see it.\n\nNarrator: His collection includes many rare Pops that were released as limited editions. Including some ultra rare ones called Chase Pops.\n\nPeeples: A Chase Pop is a Pop that you can find, kind of like the golden ticket that Willy Wonka was giving out. It's very rare, and there's only a certain limited amount of them. And they also have a special sticker on them. Also, if you collect comics, it's like a variant cover.\n\nNarrator: In 2017, he went to the grand opening of the Funko Headquarters in Washington. And got his hands on one of his most prized figurines.\n\nPeeples: It's the Emerald Freddy. It has the flagship sticker on it, which was also very rare. I also have another very rare Pop. The blue chrome Batman from San Diego Comic Con. I slept for four days in front of the San Diego Convention, and I ended up getting into the booth. I cried a lot because I was so happy and so excited. The chrome Batman is worth a lot of money. I've seen it go up right now, currently, as high on Ebay as $800.\n\nNarrator: He and his partner also placed in a lip-syncing contest at a Funko Event. And chose two giant Robin and Joker Pops as prizes, that he estimates are now worth about $1,200 each.\n\nPeeples: I do also have just a couple rare Proto Pops.\n\nNarrator: These are basically prototypes of Pops before they're massed produced. Anthony doesn't just collect Pops, however, he also organizes events with fellow collectors, including fundraisers for charity.\n\nPeeples: I host here in New York, periodically, events that I call Peeples Pop!Swap. Those events have been major, major moments where I've gotten to meet so many collectors and have so many wonderful friends because of that.\n\nNarrator: In addition to swapping, Anthony often sells Pops to help fund his trips to various conventions around the world to buy new ones.\n\nPeeples: Cause it's very expensive. The expenses do mount up.\n\nNarrator: He's active in the official Funko Forum, a message board for fans. So he always knows where to be to get the rare Pops for cheap.\n\nPeeples: I try to get them as close to the retail value that they come out for. Narrator: But he will occasionally have to pay upwards of $100 for some that he missed to complete his set. He has a few basic tips for Funko hunters.\n\nPeeples: So it's best to just be on your game. Know your information. Know where the Pop is you want. Know how much it's going to cost. And be prepared to line up and hopefully score some wonderful Funko Pops.\n\nNarrator: And he says he has no desire to stop collecting anytime soon.\n\nPeeples: Whether I collect Funko Pops or not, the one thing that is a constant, is that the people I've met and the relationships I've established from being in the Funko Pop community, they're not going anywhere in my heart. I will keep in contact whether I collect Funkos or not.\n\nAnd there's a story behind each one.\n\nSome people identify themselves as \"I'm a fiend!\" and they'll be wearing the fiend patch. Or they're a Funkero. There's Jersey Funko and there's Chicago Funko. So many across the country and they identify themselves in that way.

It's fair to say, however, that I was a Beatles obsessive; my senior-year thesis in high school was about the Fab Four.\n\nIn my later years, I've been back and forth with the band. The older I get, the more I like the gritty stuff and the very early songs, inspired by American rock-n-roll. The pop songs and the epic productions of the group's second, studio-focused period in the late 1960s now turn me off a bit.\n\nFriday brings something special: a extended, 50th anniversary re-release of the so-called \"White Album,\" which first appeared in November of 1968 on double vinyl and has become widely regarded as a document of the Beatles' cracking apart. In many ways, it was the final \"true\" Beatles album, followed by the goofy soundtrack for the film \"Yellow Submarine\" and the out-of-order releases of \"Abbey Road\" and \"Let It Be.\"\n\nRead more: 40 years ago, Led Zeppelin released its most difficult album \u2014 and it's still hard to listen to\n\nBy the end of the sixties, the group's various combative, creative urges \u2014 and in retrospect, the creativity was sort of ridiculous \u2014 had become unmanageable, and they weren't limited to the oft-debated souring of the John Lennon-Paul McCartney partnership; George Harrison and Ringo Starr were also suffering.\n\n\"The White Album.\" Apple\n\nAnd yet, as the re-release of \"The Beatles/The White Album\" proves, the guys could make monumental magic. The remixed re-issue contains a massive amount of new music, much of it loose, outtakes rather than polished performances.\n\nThen there's the 13-minute version of the Beatles' most disturbing song, \"Helter Skelter,\" made infamous by its association with Charles Manson and the Tate-LaBianca murders of 1969.\n\nComposed by McCartney as a response to the aggressive sonic experiments of Pete Townshend and The Who, \"Helter Skelter\" originally came in once cut down at about four-and-a-half minutes and has been scrutinized ever since the needle first hit wax as a prototype of punk, heavy metal, noise, and the Beatles' influence on indie rock.\n\nThere had always been tales of an extended version of the song, clocking in at almost half and hour. The 13-minute take that's on the re-release sounds like the Beatles giving rude birth to the Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth. Ringo thumps an interrupted kick-snare drone, Paul seems to stick with single bass pulse, Lennon scratches brute chords, and Harrison provides icepick fills with what sounds like a Telecaster going through a small amp turned up. McCartney's singing is restrained and borderline sickly. There's an edge of total exhaustion. It just dies at the end in a fade-out of George string bends, the weary culmination of a long, smoggy nightmare.\n\nA disturbing and brilliant version of an already disturbing and brilliant tune\n\nGreatest band ever?

It about a million miles from \"Love Me Do.\" As with the Rolling Stones when they go back to the wellspring of the blues, it demonstrate that the avant-garde Beatles \u2014 channeling the darkness that was gathering at the end of the 1960s and, to my ear, referencing extended, textural tunes from the period, such as \"East-West, \"also a 13-minute jam by guitarist Mike Bloomfield and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band \u2014 were the group at its finest.\n\nThe Beatles evidently wrapped this \"Helter Skelter\" take in the bleak, wee hours of the morning. It's the kind of thing that's hypnotic yet shattering to listen to. I can only imagine what it was like to actually make the music, especially given that it was tough to record very long takes back then on analog tape.\n\nFor me, it's exquisite. And yes, a completely new Beatles song, so different from the familiar version of \"Helter Skelter\" as to set a new standard. A strange gift from a distant past, recorded when I was a year old. The Beatles were so good that we take their contribution to culture for granted.

But Spire's associate academy director Justin Brantley told ESPN's Jeff Borzello that Ball preserved his eligibility because he was not compensated and never received payment for playing in Lithuania or in the JBA. And even though Ball signed with agent Harrison Gaines before playing overseas, the NCAA recently relaxed its rules prohibiting \"elite\" high school prospects from signing with agents.\n\nPerhaps the most concerning piece of evidence working against Ball is his Big Baller Brand shoes. Regardless of whether or not Ball has actually received any compensation for his affiliation with the brand, there is little doubt that he has used his likeness to promote the \"Melo Ball 1s\" shoe model that was named on his behalf.\n\nLaMelo also appears to be living a lavish lifestyle.\n\nSurely more information regarding Ball's future plans and NCAA eligibility will be revealed over the next few months. Regardless, enrolling at Spire Institute, where he will compete against some of the country's top high school and prep competition in teams like La Lumiere and Oak Hill, allows Ball to build a legitimate portfolio and prove he has what it takes to play at the next level \u2014 wherever that may be.", "Netflix wants to keep its powerhouse directors happy going into Oscar season, but one of the first theatrical runs for its original movies with a big name helmer has hit a snag.\n\nAlamo Drafthouse, one of the most prominent independently owned movie chains in the US, will not be showing Netflix's Oscar contender, \"Roma,\" a source close to negotiations between the chain and streaming giant told Business Insider. A source close to Netflix confirmed that Alamo Drafthouse had passed on the movie.\n\nAt the end of October, Netflix began to dramatically change course on how it released Oscar-contending movies. Reports surfaced that for the first time Netflix would stop its \"day-and-date\" model \u2014 in which the movie premieres in theaters and on Netflix the same day \u2014 and give exclusive theatrical runs of around 1-3 weeks for not just Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Roma,\" but two other of its anticipated movies, the Coen brothers' \"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,\" and Susanne Bier's \"Bird Box\" starring Sandra Bullock.\n\nAlamo Drafthouse was one of the reported chains in the mix to show \"Roma.\" But Netflix's terms on how the movie would be released, and how often, led to the popular chain passing on the anticipated title, according to the source.\n\nWhile \"Buster Scruggs\" and \"Bird Box\" are reportedly getting around one-week runs at select theaters before they are available to stream on Netflix, the company wants to pull out all the stops for \"Roma,\" which out of the three has the best chance to win Oscars in the major categories, including best picture.\n\nAlong with around a 3-4 week run for the movie, Netflix is specifically looking for theaters that can show the movie with Dolby Atmos sound or in 70mm.\n\nAs even four weeks is shorter than the traditional 90-day window that the major chains like AMC, Regal, and Cinemark want movies to be shown in theaters, Netflix knows it cannot go to them. That leaves the streaming giant to depend on the mid-level chains and independently owned arthouses.\n\nAlamo Drafthouse and Netflix had been in discussions for weeks about showing \"Roma,\" specifically at the chain's Brooklyn, New York location, which could show the movie in 70mm. It's one of the only theaters in the city that can pull that off.\n\nSarah Jacobs Netflix was stringent on its terms, according to the source, which included that \"Roma\" have a full four-week run with all the screenings show in 70mm. The company also planned to four-wall the theaters, meaning Netflix would be renting the theater from Drafthouse. (It plans to do this at all the locations where the movies will be played.) This is an unconventional move in the industry, where typically the movie theater splits the box office with the distributor.\n\nThough Drafthouse was willing to show \"Roma\" at its Brooklyn location, it does not four-wall. Also, the 70mm projector at the location is in its biggest auditorium, meaning that for four weeks the movie would take up its prime space, with Drafthouse unable to schedule in any other titles. That's a tough ask in a time of year when every weekend a new big movie is about to hit theaters.\n\n\"Just way too many restrictions and guidelines,\" the source told Business Insider.\n\n\"Roma\" will now be screened in New York at Manhattan's IFC Center beginning November 21, IFC confirmed to Business Insider. That theater does not have capabilities to show the movie in 70mm.\n\nAlamo Drafthouse is not the only theater, outside of the majors, to pass on the Netflix offer. Business Insider has reached out to multiple arthouses that said they eventually passed on showing \"Roma\" due to the terms of Netflix. These include some that would have gotten the movie following its exclusive theatrical run, after the movie began streaming on Netflix December 14.\n\n\"Terms are not too high, but higher than it should be for a movie that's streaming at the same time,\" one theater owner told Business Insider.\n\nOther theaters told Business Insider they would love to show the movie but don't have a venue that can accommodate Netflix's terms.\n\n\"It's complicated by Netflix's insistence that theaters have Dolby Atmos, an extremely expensive sound system that very few theaters can afford,\" another theater owner said.", "The migrant caravan of about 4,000 to 5,000 men, women and children left Mexico City Friday morning to continue their journey to the US via Tijuana, according to several media reports.\n\nThe US Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security also posted \"an interim final rule\" on Friday that migrants who cross the border illegally will not be able to apply for asylum.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has 5,600 troops to the border ahead of the immigrant caravan.

Mueller...should've been Senate confirmed. But because of all the conflicts, they didn't want to bring him before the Senate...so don't talk to me about Whitaker.\"\n\nCalifornia-based attorney Alexander Stern explained in a Friday email to INSIDER that because Mueller is what the Supreme Court has designated an \"inferior officer\" \u2014 and not a \"principal officer\" who reports directly to the President \u2014 he does not need to be confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"Trump is simply flat out wrong that Mueller's appointment is unconstitutional given he reports to someone above him and below Trump,\" Stern said.\n\n\"He previously reported to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Setting aside the likely invalidity of the Whitaker appointment, Mueller would now report to Whitaker,\" Stern added. \"Either way, Mueller does not report directly to the President.\"\n\nRead more:'Seriously? This guy?': Matthew Whitaker's appointment has FBI and DOJ officials in a 'daze'\n\nStern \u2014 as well as former acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal and lawyer George Conway\u2014 argue that Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional because as a principal officer who reports directly to Trump, Whitaker is required to receive the advice and consent of the US Senate, as stipulated by the US Constitution's Appointments Clause and upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote in a 2017 opinion that the authors of the Constitution included provisions for Senate advice & consent because they \"recognized the serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the government.\"\n\nUntil Wednesday, Whitaker held the position as former Attorney general Jeff Sessions' chief of staff, which did not require Senate confirmation.\n\nStern added that while Mueller's appointment is not unconstitutional, \"it does add weight to the argument that Whitaker's appointment is unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"Specifically, the chain of command before looked like Jeff Sessions (a Senate-confirmed principal officer who recused himself in the Mueller probe), then Rosenstein (also Senate-confirmed), then Mueller,\" Stern said. \"Now, because Trump unconstitutionally bypassed the Senate to install Whitaker, Mueller is being supervised by someone that did not receive Senate approval.\"\n\nWhile the Senate voted to confirm Whitaker to the position of US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa in 2004, as Trump noted in his press conference, former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner pointed out on Twitter that since Whitaker is no longer serving in that role, a confirmation for a prior position does not make his current appointment constitutionally valid.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

And its incumbent, Toni Boucher, had worked in the legislature since before Haskell was born. But with a nimble digital strategy, a campaign that involved a lot of door-knocking, and a pair of endorsements from former President Barack Obama and Sen. Chris Murphy, Haskell ousted Boucher and helped Democrats tie the state's Senate.\n\nBefore all that, Haskell worked at Business Insider. He was an intern the summer after his freshman year at Georgetown University (he graduated this past spring), writing about digital culture for Tech Insider. Some of his best-remembered articles include covering both shark-wrestling Instagram celebrities and a convention for cat lovers, as well as the occasional piece of political coverage.\n\nHaskell realized he wasn't into journalism and planned to go to law school. He had subsequent internships working for Murphy and the Democratic National Committee. But after Donald Trump became president, he took Obama's farewell speech to heart: \"If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.\"\n\nHaskell took him up on it.\n\n\"I was never planning on running for office,\" he told Business Insider. \"But this is a unique time in history that requires us to put ourselves outside of our comfort zone.\"\n\nHaskell sees his own election, in part, as a repudiation of Trump. States can be the bulwark against Republican policies, he said.\n\n\"Reproductive health freedom, LGBTQ issues, environmental regulations, voting rights \u2014 and more fundamentally, human decency and compassion. Those were all on the ballot,\" he said. \"And my community decided to show up and vote.\"\n\nHe pointed to the Connecticut Senate's failure to pass a bill protecting net neutrality, as well as the legislative body's failure to pass a \"Time's Up\" bill to protect victims of sexual harassment.\n\n\"There are so many areas where legislatures now have to be that first line of defense,\" he said. \"We can't count on Congress. We can't count on the Supreme Court to protect our most fundamental values. The job now falls to our state capitols. I view that as part of my role.\"\n\nHaskell also credits his victory to enormous turnout. The district he'll be representing had only 10% fewer voters show up between the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterms, a smaller decline than usual. He says it's because he prioritized knocking on doors and reaching voters on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Haskell says he wants to meet voters where they already are, whether on the street or on their phones.\n\n\"I gave voters a look into my daily life on my instagram stories,\" he said. \"That's something I want to continue to do as a state senator. I want people to know what it's like to be a state senator.\"\n\nHaskell also pledges to work with the media to create an informed democracy.\n\n\"Too often, politicians and journalists see their jobs in opposition of one another, when in fact we so desperately rely on journalists to accurately report information to get facts,\" he said. \"Elections are about choices, and voters can't possibly make up their minds without all the information that they need.\"", "We're heading into the homestretch of the college football season, and the stakes continue to rise for the best teams in the country.\n\nIt makes for compelling football, and some offer great gambling opportunities to bettors looking to put some money down.\n\nLast week, we had an even week of 3-3-1, so this week we'll look to get back to our winning ways,\n\nTake a look below for our seven best bets of the Week 11 college football slate (* indicates home team).\n\nLAST WEEK: 3-3-1 OVERALL: 36-32-2", "After 14 months of speculation regarding where Amazon would seat its second headquarters, known as HQ2, the $1-trillion company is splitting its new operation between Crystal City, Virginia, and Long Island City, Queens.\n\nThe decision became official on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are excited to build new headquarters in New York City and Northern Virginia,\" Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, said in an announcement on the company's blog, Day One. \"These two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come. The team did a great job selecting these sites, and we look forward to becoming an even bigger part of these communities.\"\n\nI don't share Bezos' excitement about Amazon's arrival in my community.\n\nWhat I feel is dread.\n\nI've called Queens home for most of my adult life. It is perhaps the most ethnically diverse urban area on Earth, and it's also where I've built a career in journalism, stumbled out of and into love, discovered Kuala Lumpur-style fish-head curry, walked whole neighborhoods without hearing any English, and am now raising my first child.\n\nMy family lives in a one-bedroom apartment near Long Island City (or LIC, as locals abbreviate it). Frequent dog walks and a westward view from our kitchen window have given us a front-row seat to the area's radical transformation. When I moved here in 2007, LIC was a tangle of giant warehouses, crumbling parking structures, seedy night clubs, and mind-blowing graffiti.\n\nToday it's almost unrecognizable. An impeccable public park lines the East River waterfront, and views of Manhattan's skyline \u2014 once easy to see from my street \u2014 have been walled off by gleaming, glass-covered condo towers.\n\nRead more: New York City owns a creepy island that almost no one is allowed to visit \u2014 here's what it's like\n\nI can see why Amazon would fix its gaze upon LIC and estimate a multi-billion-dollar boost to the local economy. The neighborhood is a stone's throw from Manhattan, sits fairly close to the city's three major international airports, touches several subway lines, and offers space to build and grow. Also, New York City is an incredible place to live \u2014 and thus a great way to attract talented employees, as Bezos said.\n\nMy \"not in my backyard\" angst doesn't come from a fear of change. An influx of skilled workers, a forward-thinking company, and increased tax revenue could fund a fantastic experiment in urban development.\n\nAmazon could work with local leaders, developers, and city officials to create climate-change-resilient infrastructure, designate car-free zones, expand affordable housing, boost public schools, provide easier access to food and other critical amenities, generate a raft of high-paying secondary jobs around Amazon's presence, and give some of the hardest-working (yet hardest-struggling) families in the city a chance to build intergenerational wealth.\n\nYet what I've seen, heard, and read suggests this is a dream. Instead, I expect to see deepening struggles for the working-class people who keep New York humming and arguably make it the greatest city in the world.\n\nMy fears are not just about taxes, public transit, and housing. They're about the future of the city itself.\n\nNew York officials are giving tax breaks to a $1 trillion company owned by the world's richest person\n\nJeff Bezos.

One of those public officials was NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that Amazon \"is very destructive to communities\" \u2014 then, hours later, helped submit the city's HQ2 proposal.\n\nThe details of these tax breaks became public in Amazon's blog post on Tuesday.\n\nThe state is offering the company $1.2 billion in tax breaks for bringing 25,000 jobs \"with an average wage of over $150,000\" to the area over the next 10 years, Amazon said. That's a $48,000 cut in revenue to the city per new Amazon employee. In addition, the state is prepared to hand Amazon $325 million for occupying about 4 million square feet of office space in LIC over the next 10 years.\n\nThough creating jobs can boost income and sales tax revenues over the long run \u2014 perhaps by $10 billion over 20 years, by Amazon's estimate \u2014 those monies take a while to build up. The city needs cash now to keep its subways and workforce moving, let alone to further overhaul and rethink the system.\n\nPublic transit is already bursting at the seams, and traffic is a nightmare\n\nDuring rush hour in Queens, several overcrowded trains on the 7 line often pass before any passengers can get on. Dave Mosher\n\nAs towers have sprung up in LIC and the cost of living has soared, many of my neighbors and working families are uprooting and retreating deeper into Queens, where they stand a better chance at affording housing or just scraping by. This gradual exodus is paired with what city demographers consider \"remarkable\" population growth for the borough \u2014 what could be double-digit increases in the coming decades.\n\nThese factors have brought ever-increasing demand for public transit, yet the city has not made adequate improvements quickly enough to meet it.\n\nOvercrowded trains and buses in LIC and areas to its east are the norm during peak hours. More often than not, three fully crowded subway trains pass me by on their way to LIC and Manhattan before I can squeeze onto one. If you have small children, are pregnant, or disabled, rush hour is almost impenetrable.\n\nRead more: New Yorkers are freaking out that Amazon's HQ2 could cripple the subway system, but the reality is more complicated\n\nSoul-crushing road traffic is also typical for LIC. The Queensboro Bridge (which has no toll, unlike a tunnel to the south) is typically clogged with vehicles entering or leaving Manhattan. This contributes to NYC being the third most traffic-congested and second most traffic-jammed city on Earth.\n\nIt's hard for me to imagine how at least 25,000 or more new Amazon workers, even spread out over the next decade, would efficiently get to and from work during rush hour, especially if many of them move here from outside the city and add to the area's surging population. The same goes for existing residents.\n\nRight now, the Metropolitan Transit Authority is looking at $37 billion in upkeep and overhaul work. It's also facing $42 billion in debt by 2022, according to a recent city report.\n\nAmazon is reportedly ready to invest $2.5 billion in HQ2's construction in LIC over 10 years. Its goal is to secure \"4 million square feet of energy-efficient office space with an opportunity to expand to 8 million square feet,\" the company said.\n\nIn addition, Amazon said it \"has agreed to donate space on its campus for a tech startup incubator and for use by artists and industrial businesses.\" The company also plans to donate space for a new school and \"invest in infrastructure improvements and new green spaces\" through a Payment In Lieu Of Tax agreement. (Such agreements reduce corporate property taxes but are normally reserved for manufacturing, industrial, and non-profit companies.)\n\nBut even if Amazon poured its entire planned $2.5-billion war chest into public transit, it's hard to say whether it would make a big difference. One new subway station in Manhattan, for example, cost about $4 billion.\n\nYears of decisions by the city have led to this transit crisis, and it's primarily up to our officials to fix it \u2014 especially now that they've successfully lured Amazon.\n\nQueens housing costs are high \u2014 and they're only getting worse\n\nQueens communities are struggling to deal with development and rising costs of living. Dave Mosher\n\nAbout half of Queens residents are immigrants. Many live in poverty; the median income here for a household \u2014 as in an entire family \u2014 was roughly $60,000 a year in 2016. Rent can gobble up a majority of these families' take-home salaries, and Amazon is almost certain to make this situation more difficult for lower-income households.\n\nThe median rent in Queens was about $1,400 a month in 2016. (By contrast, the average New York state mortgage payment \u2014 which builds equity, unlike rent \u2014 was about $1,300.) Today, studios or one-bedroom apartments in older buildings in or around LIC rent for more than $2,000 a month. In LIC's shiny new towers, such units cost north of $3,000 a month, and two-bedroom units can run $4,000-$5,000 per month.\n\nWhile many of the new buildings in LIC have some subsidized units, you must apply through lotteries to rent them. The process comes with significant income restrictions and it can take years before applicants get selected. Even if you're picked, the \"affordable\" unit price breaks can be negligible.\n\nThe market to buy real estate is just as brutal.\n\nWhen I moved to western Queens more than a decade ago, amid the Great Recession, one-bedroom apartments were listing for sale at about $200,000. These apartments are generally 600-700 square feet, but some today sell for more than $500,000.\n\nHomes with two or three bedrooms, and maybe a driveway or tiny patch of grass out back, have grown even more out-of-reach for the vast majority of families here. Half-century-old properties \u2014 many of which require extensive and expensive renovations \u2014 are now listing for more than $1 million, sometimes $1.5 million.\n\nRead more: Renters in New York and Washington could pay upward of $200 more annually if Amazon splits its new headquarters between the 2 cities\n\nGiven these housing prices, Amazon's workers will likely realize that even $150,000 a year can feel small in this borough, let alone in Manhattan or nearby Brooklyn neighborhoods, where the cost of living is even higher.\n\nThese are comparatively short-term concerns, though. Future generation will have a lot more to worry about.\n\nHow will Amazon deal with climate change?\n\nProjected sea levels in 2100 show Long Island City will be mostly underwater. Google Earth/Climate Central\n\nOver the long-term, many working families in western Queens might secure a better future by packing up and leaving (if they can afford it). This is a conversation my wife and I have with increasing frequency as we plan for the long-term future of our family.\n\nClimate change is here to stay, and its effects will get much worse and more disruptive in the coming decades.\n\nAmong other problems, hurricanes are getting rainier, slower-moving, and more devastating; areas of intense drought are expanding; wildfires are intensifying; and coral reefs that protect coasts from storms are dying.\n\nBut most relevant to Amazon HQ2's long-term existence is the ceaseless rise of sea levels.\n\n\"A 2017 report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggested that, under the worst climate conditions, parts of New York \u2014 including parts of Long Island City \u2014 could be underwater by 2100,\" my colleague Aria Bendix wrote earlier this week.\n\nEven if this gloomy scenario does not come to pass, LIC's current and future inhabitants must anticipate increasingly powerful storm surges and chronic flooding. It's not yet clear if Amazon leadership is taking these climate-related risks into account, and if or whether they intend to work with local officials in New York to plan for and combat those problems on a decades-long scale. (The only mention of \"climate\" in Amazon's announcement was \"business climate.\")\n\nRead more: Here's what Earth might look like in 100 years \u2014 if we're lucky\n\nBarring an all-out effort by the city, state, and federal government to control or at least mitigate these looming environmental problems, building in LIC seems like a questionable long-term investment for Amazon; it is likely going to be a future epicenter for climate change refugees.\n\nIt's unfair to single out Amazon alone when talking about this long-term threat, of course.\n\nAs individuals and a society, we all need to stop pretending that climate change won't affect the homes, cities, and infrastructure we are building for future generations. It will, and it is, and our collective short-sightedness is what worries me most of all.\n\nThis story has been updated.

It's the parent company of Burger King, Tim Horton's, and Popeyes.\n\nHe started out his career at the investment firm 3G Capital. In 2010, when he was only 29, the firm's managing partner, Alex Behring, took a big chance on him, by making him chief financial officer of Burger King. At the time, he had almost no management experience.\n\nNow, Schwartz is returning the favor, betting on young talent to lead his businesses.\n\nListen to the full episode here:\n\nSubscribe to \"This is Success\" on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, or your favorite podcast app. Check out previous episodes with:\n\nTranscript edited for clarity.\n\nDaniel Schwartz: When we bought the business, Alex had suggested that I join as CFO, which is a pretty big position, especially for someone who didn't really have all that much experience, and by all that much, I mean, like none, right?\n\nRichard Feloni: Had you ever been a manager of anything?\n\nSchwartz: I managed one analyst at 3G.\n\nFeloni: It was big leap.\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, it was definitely. It was a change in role for me. Just to give you a sense of how naive I was, I never worked in a company before. When people were talking and the folks at 3G were talking about we need to make sure that we set the business up with a great team from the start, even that idea I couldn't really relate to it. I'm like, \"Wait a minute, it's a business. It runs itself.\"\n\nFeloni: It was really back to basics for you.\n\nSchwartz: Then you get there, and you realize, well, it's actually not a business that runs itself. All it really is is a bunch of people running around doing stuff. If have really good people that are running around in the right direction who really care, then you get stuff done much, much better, and much faster. I quickly learned that you don't manage the business itself but manage the people, and help the people manage the business. That was the big contrast from working in finance and working in private equity at 3G, where I was able to manage the business effectively myself. I was working with the bankers and the lawyers, and we had a model for the deal, and I would do all that on my own and maybe together with an analyst. You get it done without a team.\n\nIn a company, there's just so much to do and so many different things. Even if you prioritize, which I think we are particularly good at, just focusing on a few important things, but you're only as effective as your team. I quickly realized the importance of having just an amazing team. I made some mistakes early on. There was one person in the team who wasn't able to do something, so I just took the work back myself. I remember Bernardo [Hees], who was then the CEO, said, \"This is wrong. You can't do that. This is not sustainable. This is not scalable. You have to have a good team who's able to execute.\"\n\nFeloni: It was like micromanagement.\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, which just doesn't work for a whole bunch of reasons. That was the big transition, realizing the importance of the team. That's stuck with me, and recruiting, in general, is something that's just always been and always has been and always will be a top priority for our company. I personally recruit at all the schools. I was at Cornell, as you can see from this notepad.\n\nFeloni: You personally recruit even as CEO?\n\nSchwartz: I and several other members of the leadership team all personally recruit. I'm on campus, as are several other leaders of the company, and we're all personally interviewing candidates. Because this company, in all companies, they're only as good as the people who work there. If you have great people, you accomplish incredible, incredible things. Unfortunately, the opposite is also true.\n\nHow to develop young talent\n\nFeloni: Well, what's behind this whole philosophy of hiring people who are young and giving them a lot of opportunities and seeing if they could rise to it? Why is that better than just taking in someone who's a seasoned professional?\n\nSchwartz: Look, there's no right or wrong. That's all I know. It worked out well for me. People bet on me at a young age, and I worked really hard to put myself in a position to get folks comfortable to bet on me. I, in turn, feel like I have to do the same. That's all I know. That's what our culture's about. I think if you want to have a culture that's centered around meritocracy, you need to be able to live it. You need to be able to live meritocracy, and living meritocracy is giving people a chance who perform well.\n\nAs I've mentioned, I was given a shot to be CFO at a young age, and then, in 2013, the CEO of Burger King went on to become the CEO of Heinz. Look, the board could have certainly gone elsewhere and found a more seasoned executive than me. I was 32 at the time. I had a done a good job, and the board had confidence that I'd be able to step up and go into this elevated role.\n\nThen I remember the board had asked me, and the folks in 3G had asked me, \"Well, who can succeed you [as CFO]?\" The best person at the time was a 26-year-old person in finance who was a very mature, bright fellow who'd done an incredible job. I said, \"Look, this is the best candidate, despite his age.\" We made Josh Kobza the CFO.\n\nLook, again, that was a big selling point for us to be able to attract a bunch of great people at schools and elsewhere around the country and internationally, that if you do well and if you work hard we'll give you an opportunity faster than you'd get it elsewhere. I think that's good. I fundamentally believe that that's the right thing to do because it's much better anytime you can make a bet on someone you know and someone who has in fact delivered. I think you're more likely to be successful than if you go outside. Sometimes people like to go outside and call the headhunter because it helps. Almost in a way, it's like anti-ownership, right, or anti-accountable in that like if it doesn't work out, you can say, \"Well, you know, the person was vetted by this great headhunter, so it's really not my fault.\"\n\nFeloni: Pass the blame, yeah.\n\nSchwartz: \"Yeah, it's this headhunter's fault. It's not my fault. It's this headhunter, but they were vetted. He'd done great elsewhere.\" Whereas if you make a bet on someone in the company and it doesn't work, then it's really on you. That's how it should be, right, if you're running a company, you should act like an owner. Owners can take chances. Owners can sometimes make mistakes, but that's a much better way of going about doing things.\n\nAn unlikely executive\n\nFeloni: I want to step back a little to see the path that you got on. How did you end up getting into finance in the first place?\n\nSchwartz: I went to Cornell. I didn't know I would do finance. I took some premed courses \u2014 a bunch of folks in my family are in medicine. I took some financial courses, and I read a whole host of different books about finance.\n\nFeloni: When you were starting to study finance, were you doing your own reading as well, like when you were saying you were looking through business books?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, I read all the 1980s finance ones.\n\nFeloni: Like \"Barbarians at the Gate\"?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, all those books. They were fun, and the books about all the creation of the leveraged-buyout industry, and at the same time, reading textbooks about basic finance 101.\n\nFeloni: That was in your free time?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah.\n\nFeloni: That sounds like the last thing I would want to do in college, is read some business history.\n\nSchwartz: I didn't get on here and say I was cool or anything! I'm just being honest.\n\nFeloni: That's funny. Is this a habit that you still have, like self-teaching?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, I love reading interesting books.\n\nFeloni: Do you take lessons from these books and actually apply them to your job?\n\nSchwartz: It's hard. I think if you find like one or two takeaways from each of these books. Now, someone told me there's an app that you can go on to get the one or two takeaways from the books, but it seems like it takes away the fun of things.\n\nUnder Schwartz, Burger King has revamped its approach to advertising, including the Cannes Grand Prix-winning \"Google Home for the Whopper\" ad, produced by agency David Miami. YouTube\n\nFeloni: When you became CEO of Burger King, there was a lot of coverage calling you a \"prodigy\" or \"whiz kid\" and stuff like that. You're shaking your head \"no\"!\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, no. By the way, I think that might have been the Business Insider coverage.\n\nFeloni: There was one. There were multiple ones, but I think BI was the one that gave you the \"whiz kid\" title, so you're welcome.\n\nSchwartz: Thank you, I think. No, look, I always did well at school. I always had good grades. I worked really hard. I always studied hard. No one had to tell me to do my homework or anything like that. I'm not a prodigy. I'm not like a whiz kid. I'm smart, but I think what has differentiated me is a combination of hard work ethic and humility and just willingness to learn, to grow.\n\nI think we have some really smart people at our company. The ones who do really well, they're really hardworking, and they have drive. They really care, and they act like an owner, and they want to get stuff done. What's nice about our culture is that enables us. What we do is we make these people owners, right? We make them owners in the business. We grant them stock. We give them a piece of the pie. If they act like an owner, we make them an owner. That's how I was treated, and that's how I feel that we should treat our team members.\n\nUltimately, I think I always worked hard. I always really cared about the results or the projects that I was working on. I tell people in our company that you have to work, and this is advice someone gave me actually one time, it was, like, you have to work really hard to put yourself in a position to get lucky because a lot of what happens is circumstantial. It's a function of what's going on when, but the folks who do work really hard and really care about their results, opportunities come up for them because of the way we manage the business that we're always looking to source talent internally.\n\nLet's say, if you're working in marketing and you're doing really great and everybody knows, because everyone talks about everyone \u2014 everyone knows, \"Rich, you're doing great in marketing\" \u2014 and an opportunity for promotion comes in operations, well, we'll give you a shot at that. We'll give you a shot at that, and that helps accelerate this pace of opportunity creation for people that you're not just going to be labeled as a marketing person. That you can move elsewhere, you can move to HR operations and because we look internally and we promote from within, that helps kind of perpetuate this culture of meritocracy and this ability to really give people a shot at a younger age.\n\nFeloni: So it sounds like it's an approach where the job title itself is less important. It's more the person.\n\nSchwartz: We like to make sure that people have the right skill set to be able to do a job. But yeah, ultimately for people who are really talented, who are really passionate, who really care. We feel like a lot of what we do you could acquire the skills along the way. I mean, there are some exceptions in specialty areas, but you have to remember we're not launching rocket ships and we're not delivering babies here. So a lot of the stuff that we do is fungible. And I've seen people move across areas who have been quite successful.\n\nFlipping burgers and serving ice cream\n\nFeloni: When you were growing into these roles and learning from mistakes, was there a method or insight you learned that, if you did run into one of these mistakes, you did something wrong, that there was a way for you to process it where it didn't happen again?\n\nSchwartz: The biggest lesson is to always realize that if something's not working, you either have the wrong owner, the wrong person managing it, or the wrong strategy, and you need to be pretty sure which one that is. And more often than not, with us, it's internally, it's a people issue and we need to make sure that we have the right people in the right places. And that's hard. I think that's something that's hard for companies and for people to act on quickly. But if you could be honest with yourself and you always put the business before any of these other personal situations that allows you to be more nimble and to fix things quickly. So, it's my two cents on that.\n\nFeloni: And when you joined Burger King, you were saying that you hadn't had any experience in the restaurant and industry or actually even a company as you said, a traditional company, but how did you go about learning how the business works?\n\nSchwartz: So I think the key to at least my transition and other people's transitions is that when you come into one of these roles, you have to kind of realize what you know and have a full appreciation. And that comes back to humility of what you don't know and you have to be willing to ask a lot of questions, and realize that most of the people around you have all the answers and it's on you to ask the smart questions. And I remember I asked people so many questions and I'm sure some of them were perceived as being pretty stupid, but I didn't know the answer, I wanted to know. And just asking lots of questions and building a really good team of people who really believed in the project and wanted to grow the business. That was the key.\n\nFeloni: And would you visit some of the locations as well?\n\nSchwartz: Oh for sure. I mean, I spend a disproportionate amount of my time on the road visiting restaurants and meeting with our partners all over the world. Just two weeks ago we were in Singapore with the local team in Asia. We were visiting restaurants with our team, our franchise partners in Jakarta, Indonesia, and in Shanghai, China. And just last week in Toronto. So I'm always spending time with our teams visiting restaurants because that's where you learn the most about the business. Talking to the franchise owners, talking to the folks working in restaurants. When I became CEO, I spent a bit of time working in the restaurants to learn just to \u2014\n\nFeloni: Like actually making food and stuff?\n\nSchwartz: Actually making food. Yeah, like making hamburgers, making milkshakes. My worst performance was making ice-cream cones. I was just, for whatever reason, never able to get the perfect swirl. And I spent a bunch of time in restaurants for several weeks, and it just helped me learn more about the business. And it's important, it helps you stay close to what's actually going on. You can lose sight of that if you're just sitting in an office and working on PowerPoint and Excel as opposed to actually being in the restaurant. So I did that for some time at Burger King, right before I became CEO. And let's just say if it was a busy day, the crew did not appreciate my presence in the restaurant.\n\nFeloni: So you'd go to one of these locations and they'd be like, \"Oh man, we have to have the CEO come cook with us\"?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, but the then manager \u2014 she's now one of the head trainers for us in Miami \u2014 she was kind and she gave me time, and she helped teach me a whole lot about working in the restaurant. I did not get any special treatment, I could assure you. And it's a great experience and something I encourage other folks in the company to do.\n\nSetting growth goals\n\nFeloni: And when you had decided that Burger King would be a good opportunity to take to 3G, that there was a big gap in terms of market value with McDonald's who was ahead of it. So was your first task, like, \"All right, here's what we're going to do to lessen that gap\"?\n\nSchwartz: It's all about growth. Burger King had less than, I think, 12,000 restaurants and was in 80 countries, but the brand wasn't growing all that fast. I think that year that we bought it, in 2010, it only opened around 150 restaurants. Last year we opened up over 1,000 restaurants across the three brands, we opened a restaurant like every six or seven hours of every day, of every day of the year.\n\nFeloni: Really?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah. So it's about having the right growth strategy and making sure that we had the right partnerships around the world to accelerate the pace of Burger King growth.\n\nFeloni: And key to turning companies around for your brands would be cutting costs where there would be excess spending in some if it was like a lavish perk, that would be something easily like an obvious choice. But I'd imagine there would be some that would be painful for employees as well. Have you run into difficulties with that when turning companies around?\n\nSchwartz: We try not to look at it as much like cutting costs as ownership of costs, and so as the owner of the business, you treat the money as if it were your own. And so this idea of having a lavish party or a crazy perk like you're talking about, it's kind of pretty obvious to folks in the company \u2014 look, you should treat the company's money as if it were your own. And we build our budgets each year with that philosophy, that you're going to have a budget and you should spend accordingly. And if there's an area that we want to prioritize, we agree we'll prioritize that. If there's an area that we don't think adds value, we won't spend as much money there.\n\n3G Capital formed Restaurant Brands International after buying iconic Canadian brand Tim Hortons in 2013. Reuters\n\nIn your personal life, you have a budget and you're not going to spend more than you can afford. But when people work in a company, oftentimes that concept is lost on them and that, like, \"Well, it's not really my money; it's just the company's money; it's the company.\" But we'd say from the beginning, the company is just a bunch of us doing things. And so it's important to view the money as if it were your own. We have consequences. If you spend more than your budget, then maybe you won't be eligible to get a bonus or maybe you won't be eligible for something else. And most of the folks who come work with us and do well with us, they like this, they act like owners. And they're there because they believe in the project and they want to do something really great and they want to grow. And this whole idea of being trying to be more resourceful and having a budget. People don't mind that, they like that, in fact, some of the best innovation, some of the best companies, they started out having to be very resourceful.\n\nThe greatest startups \u2014 people you guys interview here \u2014 they had to be resourceful and they had to think differently because they didn't have endless budgets, and that idea of needing to be resourceful, that generates creativity and that generates a whole lot of good stuff for the company.\n\nFeloni: I saw that you have a goal system that's public, or some color-coded thing.\n\nSchwartz: We have a handful of priorities that we as a company focus on, and there are goals that I have individually. I'll cascade those goals to folks on my team, and they'll cascade them, and so on, and so forth. So, everybody's aligned, moving, marching in the same direction. People are very transparent. We're very objective. If something's going well, we give it a green. If it's in the middle, we give it a yellow. And, if it's not going so well, we give it a red. I think, again, that's one of the benefits of this ownership culture, this 3G ownership culture that you can be real. You can be transparent, because that's what owners are. Right? If you own the place, you're not going to lie to any ... You don't have to defend yourself to anyone. You have to just be honest with yourself of, look, here's what's working, here's what's not. If I want to do things better, I need to improve this. That's the difference between an owner and just an employee, right? It's just a different mindset. So, that's how we operate. It's very transparent. If you come to our office, well, actually, we don't have an office. We just kind of sit in open desks.\n\nFeloni: OK, so, yeah, you don't have a walled-off office?\n\nSchwartz: No, I don't have a walled-off area. It's just a desk, just like everybody else. On my desk, or behind my desk, there are my seven or eight goals for the year and how I'm doing. We like to set big goals, so at any given time I'm probably not totally green. If I was totally green, it maybe would mean the goals were too easy.\n\nFeloni: What do they look like now? Could we get some insight into any of them?\n\nSchwartz: It's a mixed bag with a path to ... hopefully a path to green in most of them by the end of the year, but that's OK. We like to challenge ourselves. These big bold goals. It's not fun if you're going to set really easy targets, right?\n\nLearning about leadership and career advancement\n\nFeloni: I've seen something where you said that you don't raise your voice at work and you don't have tantrums. Have you ever had a boss or a colleague who did have that approach?\n\nSchwartz: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did, and I didn't like it. Now, the only people who are doing that in my life right now are my children.\n\nFeloni: Oh, that's good.\n\nSchwartz: But, yeah, I had.\n\nFeloni: When, just starting out?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, or early on. There was one guy who would have kind of crazy, crazy outbursts. I said to myself, \"Look, I don't want to act like that. That doesn't make sense.\" It doesn't. You don't get the best out of people. You don't bring a good level of energy when you do that. You go to the office, you want to have a good level of energy. You want to be positive. You want to encourage people to work harder and work faster and get stuff done. Even if you don't agree with people, if you do it in a respectful way and you let them know that you still think that they can do some great things, then they'll be even more encouraged to go out there and do those things. Look, we all have our bad days. We all have our good days, but I try to be as balanced as I can and try to be honest and real with people I have meetings with at work.\n\nFeloni: What drives you for all of this, regardless of what company you're working with?\n\nSchwartz: Look, I like to win, just like everybody else. I think we, as a team, we hope to be able to look back five, 10 years from now and say, \"Look, this group of people really did something transformational. They really took these brands that maybe either weren't going that fast or were more local, and they made them global. They did incredible work in marketing. They did incredible work in development, and they really ... They transformed a company in an industry.\" I think it'd be really cool for us to be able to say that, and the other piece that really gets me most excited is the people life cycle. I find it personally fascinating to get to go to college campuses or undergrad programs, MBA programs, or even just people who are within the network of people who work with us and meet these interesting people, hire them, and see how incredibly well they do in the company. That's fun.\n\nNow, I'll go to Asia or I'll go to Europe, and I'll bump into someone I hired four years ago or five years ago. The person has since grown and is running a big business. That's fulfilling. That's a lot of fun, and I think hopefully the next phase of the story, if we can say that we've transformed a company or done something incredibly well would be that there's this really strong bench of people ready to take the company to even the next level. So, that's what kind of keeps me going.\n\nFeloni: Looking at the span of your career, what would you say was the biggest challenge that you've overcome?\n\nSchwartz: The biggest change in my career was the transition from the finance role, the day-to-day finance role at 3G, to a management role, actually working at a real company with a bunch of people. I got good advice from great people who made that transition, people like Beto Sicupira, who was a partner at 3G and at one point in his career ran one of the largest retailers in Latin America, from Alex Behring, who had a similar transition, and again the advice was just all about managing the people and not the business and making sure you focus on a few things, stay focused, don't spread yourself too thin, but ultimately make sure you have the best, best people on your team. Make sure you have the right people in the right places, and always just eat and live and breathe the culture of meritocracy. I try and do that every day, and hopefully that makes the company a better place to work and a better company each and every day.\n\nFeloni: What is the skill that you've found in yourself that has allowed you to progress so quickly through these roles?\n\nSchwartz: I have a pretty good ability to spot talent, and I have a pretty good ability to make big people bets and also to make sure that we continue to make sure that we have the right people in the right places. By doing that, I think that's what's enabled the company to move at the pace that it's moved. Not specific projects that I'm doing or not doing, but really making sure that we continue to bring in a high caliber of talent and make sure that our meritocracy culture is in fact working, and that doesn't stall, and that we continue awarding responsibility to those who deserve it, which as the company grows in size, that's something ... If you ask me, \"What was I worried about at points? Was that something would we steer away from our hands on ownership meritocracy culture with the growth in the company?\" I think that's something that we've been able to avoid. We've been able to stay pretty true to our culture of having really good people.\n\nFeloni: How do you personally define success?\n\nSchwartz: I think success, for us, if you want to step back and just be objective, you have to measure the size of the brands. If our brands are growing bigger each and every year, if people, if our guests love our brands, that will be the ultimate objective. If the brands are much bigger five, 10 years from now, people love the brands, as a company, that means we were probably pretty successful. In order to make that happen, we need awesome people. We need the right strategy, and we need awesome people. You can't have one without the other. You need both.\n\nRestaurant Brands International added Popeyes in 2017, with the goal of growing its global presence. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nFeloni: Do you link your personal success with the success of the company?\n\nSchwartz: I think there are other factors that go into personal success, right? You have to be successful at home and at work. I think objectively measuring success at work, growing the size of the brands, you're attracting and retaining great people, then you're successful at work. But, personal success, you need to also be successful at home. Is my family happy? Are my children doing well? Do I have a good relationship with them? Do I feel like I'm instilling good values in them? Are they growing as people and have a loving relationship with my wife? So, that's also really important.\n\nFeloni: It's the balance.\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, it's a balance. It's a virtuous cycle. You have to be happy at work. If you're happy at work, when you come home at the end of the night, you're going to be happy at home. If you're not, you have to be happy at home, you'll be happy. It's a bit of a virtuous cycle, and other people have said that. So, I want to be successful at both. You can't have one without the other.\n\nFeloni: Is there a piece of advice that you would give to someone who wants to have a career like yours? Maybe they're just starting out, or they're just in the early stages of their career?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah: Just work really hard. That's how you can differentiate yourself. Be open-minded. Be humble. Work really hard. I think if you're working really hard, harder than all your peers, you'll eventually be in a position to do something big at some point.\n\nFeloni: Is that what you mean by outwork the people around you?\n\nSchwartz: Yeah, you have to work really hard because there's plenty of smart people out there. There'll be plenty of people who have more than you and all that. So, you just have to outwork people. That's within your control.\n\nFeloni: Well, thank you so much, Daniel.\n\nSchwartz: Thanks for having me.", "Goldman Sachs has been searching for years for an investment-banking equivalent to the vaunted risk-management system its traders use. It may have just found it.\n\nThis week, the company agreed to buy ClearFactr, a one-person startup that makes a cloud-based program similar to Microsoft Excel, according to a note the company sent to clients this week. Its founder, Dean Zarras, will join Goldman Sachs as a managing director and stick around to continue developing the financial-modeling software, the note said.\n\nI know what you're thinking. Financial modeling? Snooze.\n\nFor decades, Wall Street has relied on Microsoft's Excel program to handle financial models, keep track of trading positions, and underpin much of the calculations that make the industry work. Excel is ubiquitous.\n\nBut ClearFactr may help Goldman solve one of the most entrenched challenges in investment banking: how to update the financial-modeling software that bankers use for the digital age.\n\nGoldman Sachs reviewed several options\n\nGoldman has struggled with the question, considering solutions from relieving bankers from the task entirely to teaching them to code, according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who asked for anonymity to speak freely. Both solutions felt too extreme, and many bankers complained that learning to build models was a foundational skill they wanted to learn at Goldman, the person said.\n\nSo, it went searching for some middle ground.\n\nTalks with ClearFactr began about a year and a half ago. Many insiders were initially skeptical about the program's promise, largely because of how Excel is so completely integrated into work flows. They began to come around after the company was one of the first two to be accepted into GS Accelerate, a technology incubator announced earlier this year to give employees and, in some cases, outside partners a chance to turn outside-the-box ideas into real businesses.\n\nAnd ClearFactr isn't meant to be an Excel-killer, the person said. But Goldman bankers will be able to import and export their models between ClearFactr and Excel, and bankers will be asked to do some of the more common modeling exercises in ClearFactr from now on, the person said.\n\nThe software is based in the cloud, making it easy to apply big data and artificial-intelligence techniques across hundreds of thousands of models. Goldman will migrate the storage of models off of analysts' desktops and into a central repository, so the model isn't tied to the banker.\n\nNatural language-processing capabilities embedded in the software define cells, not by Excel's conventions that refer to cells by their column and row location, but by the description of the financial metrics the cells reference. While it seems like a simple thing, the difference will make it easier for those who didn't make the model to audit, or modify or reuse it.\n\n\"This transaction represents a tremendous validation of the core premise of the product,\" Zarras wrote in the note he sent to customers. Access to the website will be ended by year-end and all data and models saved in the platform will be deleted, he wrote. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.\n\nRichard Rivero, global head of the investment-banking strats group \u2014 a collection of quants who work alongside bankers \u2014 led the transaction for Goldman.\n\nThe Wall Street giant has lofty ambitions for ClearFactr\n\nThe hope is that storing models in a common database will foster the creation of an ecosystem around them. Bankers will be able to link disparate models, deconstruct them into components, pipe them into other applications with the use of APIs, push them out to mobile devices for bankers who are traveling, and introduce more frequent checks or compliance sign offs. Goldman can also begin to build a collection of templates to get young bankers up and running more quickly.\n\nEventually, Goldman may load the models onto iPads for pitch meetings so bankers can easily explain and alter the model assumptions for curious corporate execs. Other divisions of the bank will also be encouraged to use it, from the merchant bank to the research division.\n\nThe archetype is the securities division's 25-yea-old database, SecDB, which has been largely credited with helping Goldman avoid the worst of the financial crisis. Employees no longer build options-pricing models or swap calculators because it's already in SecDB, much as standardized merger models or common financial models might be housed in ClearFactr, freeing bankers to focus on more complex modeling problems, the person said.\n\nSelling services\n\nOne aspect of the GS Accelerate innovation program ClearFactr participated in asks bankers to consider the project's money-making prospects. It's part of a broader discussion taking place around selling the bank's data, or services, such as the trading execution, portfolio analytics, and risk management capabilities offered by its Marquee platform. That's led some execs to begin thinking, years into the future, about the ways that the bank might sell the ClearFactr software to other banks, private-equity firms or hedge funds, and even other industries.\n\nBut first, Goldman must convince its thousands of employees that there's an alternative to their favorite financial-modeling software.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

These dresses will never sell in America. They're too sexy; they're too daring.'\"\n\nOn the 12-hour flight back to Tel Aviv, Tornai said she cried until the plane touched down. Instead of giving up, she went home and created a collection of dresses that could adapt to American bridal fashion. She sent the collection back to Kleinfeld with an email saying, \"Please expose these dresses in your store. If they don't sell, send them back to me.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, Tornai got a phone call from the owner of Kleinfeld, who said the store had a problem with her dresses \u2014 they sold too many and weren't sure if Tornai could keep up with the amount of orders.\n\n\"And the rest is history,\" Tornai said.\n\nFor 13 years, Tornai traveled back and forth from Tel Aviv to New York City on 12-hour flights to ensure her gowns flourished at Kleinfeld.\n\nOnce Kleinfeld's show \"Say Yes to the Dress\" took off nine years ago, Tornai became one of the most requested designers at the store.

During a meeting with The Federalist Society, the the attorney general said, \"I think that's what I had to do.\"\n\nAnd shortly after the investigation began, Sessions told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he took the correct course of action.\n\n\"I recused myself, not because of any asserted wrongdoing, or any belief that I may have been involved in any wrongdoing in the campaign,\" Sessions said, \"but because a Department of Justice regulation ... I felt, required it.\"\n\nBut Sessions' decision was not without difficulties.

This guy?\" the agent, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, told INSIDER. \"No words.\"\n\nFrank Montoya Jr., a recently retired FBI special agent, said the predominant mood within the bureau is \"angst.\"\n\n\"There is a lot of angst about what [Whitaker's] appointment means largely because, contrary to what Trump or his supporters say, folks in the DOJ and the FBI actually pride themselves on their objectivity,\" Montoya told INSIDER. \"I spent a lot of time in meetings at all levels of the bureaucracy, and partisan politics never drove the decision making process. There is a lot of angst that someone like Whitaker may try to change that.\"\n\nRead more: Robert Mueller has reportedly begun drafting his final report in the Russia probe\n\nWhile he was Sessions' chief of staff, Whitaker reportedly met with Trump in the Oval Office over a dozen times. And according to The Washington Post, whenever Trump complained about the ongoing Russia investigation Whitaker \"often smiled knowingly and nodded in assent.\"\n\nThe Russia investigation, spearheaded by the special counsel Robert Mueller, has been a thorn in Trump's side since shortly after he took office. In addition to investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election, Mueller is also looking into whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to tilt the race in his favor, as well as whether Trump sought to obstruct justice after learning of the investigation's existence last March.\n\nThe special counsel is said to be nearing the end stages of the Russia probe \u2014 he has reportedly begun writing his final report\u2014 and Whitaker's appointment raises new questions about the fate of the investigation.\n\n\"This decision is unsurprising,\" another current FBI agent told INSIDER. \"POTUS has always wanted to replace Jeff Sessions with someone loyal to him.

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nPeople at the DOJ are 'in a daze' and 'pretty embarrassed'\n\nOnce described as the West Wing's \"eyes and ears\" in the DOJ, Whitaker made the rounds on right-wing media over the last two years claiming without evidence, that there was \"no collusion\" between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\nHe also said in a CNN op-ed last year that Mueller had overstepped his mandate by digging into the Trump Organization's finances.\n\nAnd late Thursday, audio footage resurfaced of Whitaker claiming the \"left is trying to sow this theory that essentially Russians interfered with the US election, which has been proven false. They did not have any impact in the election.\"\n\nThe US intelligence community concluded last year that Russia mounted an elaborate campaign to meddle in the 2016 election to elevate Trump to the presidency. The assessment did not reach a conclusion about whether Russia's meddling had an impact on the results.\n\nIn another recording reported on by Mother Jones, Whitaker said the president cannot obstruct justice and can kill any investigation he wants.\n\n\"Main Justice people are in a daze\" since Whitaker's appointment \"and have been for a while,\" one former DOJ official \u2014 who requested anonymity to freely discuss the mood within the department \u2014 told INSIDER. \"Local [assistant US attorneys] are keeping their heads down and just doing their work but are pretty embarrassed, particularly in New York and Chicago.\"\n\nMontoya described a similar atmosphere.\n\n\"The Whitaker appointment was a slap in the face to every lawyer at DOJ,\" he said. \"It was also an insult to everyone at FBI, and particularly, those working with the special counsel.

Sources also told The Post that Whitaker would likely oppose a request from Mueller to subpoena the president if it came down to it.\n\nA former senior DOJ official, who worked closely with Mueller when he was the FBI director, told INSIDER that although the special counsel is \"as by-the-books as it gets, he likely won't take it lying down if he thinks the integrity of his investigation has been compromised.\"\n\nRobert Mueller. AP\n\nIs Whitaker's appointment constitutional?\n\nThe myriad questions surrounding Whitaker's independence prompted DOJ veterans and constitutional-law experts to begin laying the groundwork to argue that Mueller could challenge Whitaker's appointment if he overruled a decision by the special counsel.\n\nAttorneys Neal Katyal and George Conway wrote in a New York Times op-ed that because a \"principal officer\" of the US must be confirmed by the Senate, \"President Trump's installation of Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general of the United States after forcing the resignation of [former Attorney General] Jeff Sessions is unconstitutional. It's illegal. And it means that anything Mr. Whitaker does, or tries to do, in that position is invalid.\"\n\nThe argument has also gained steam in some conservative-leaning circles.\n\n\"Just to be clear, you can have an acting Attorney General,\" tweeted conservative commentator and Trump critic Erick Erickson. \"See e.g. Sally Yates. But you cannot have an acting AG who had not been through a confirmation process for an AG position. Yates was confirmed as a Deputy AG.

At the end of the day, most early retirees are in pursuit of a personal sense of freedom that isn't available to them in the corporate world.\n\nBut that freedom shouldn't be used to serve yourself, says Vicki Robin, the co-author of the best-seller \"Your Money or Your Life,\" which has inspired young Americans to join the Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE) movement since it was first published 20 years ago.\n\nIn the Wall Street Journal's podcast \"Secrets of Wealthy Women,\" Robin said early retirees should use their position and independence to focus on helping others.\n\n\"The idea of financial independence is great, but if you don't use your freedom in service to something higher than just yourself, then what are we doing other than taking a lot of smart people out of the common project called our society?\" Robin said.\n\nShe added: \"I hope that people who pull the trigger, as they say in the FIRE movement, who graduate from the W-2, help these people turn their attention and their incredible intellectual power \u2014 the commitment that got them financial independence \u2014 I'd love to see that commitment to solving the problems of our world.\"\n\nRead more:5 people explain how their life unexpectedly changed after retiring early\n\nNot only does helping others, well, help others \u2014 it also helps you. Giving can increase your own health, wellness, and personal growth, wrote Shana Lebowitz in a LearnVest article, citing research by sociologists Christian Smith and Hilary Davidson in \"The Paradox of Generosity.\" It can also help you beat financial insecurity because it requires planning and budgeting, she wrote.\n\nBut giving to make yourself feel better doesn't work \u2014 to fully experience the positivity of charitable giving, you have to think about making a difference in someone else's life, according to Lebowitz.\n\nShe cited research that found altruistic behavior, in which one doesn't expect anything in return, can lessen feelings of negativity.\n\n\"The main reason why generosity makes us happier and healthier is because it allows us to shift our focus away from ourselves,\" she wrote.", "Le'Veon Bell's holdout might finally be coming to an end.\n\nOn Thursday, Steelers owner Art Rooney II said that the team expects Bell to report this week.\n\n\"I don't know what his plans are, but I would say that at this point we expect him to come back next week,\" Rooney said. \"We know he's back in Pittsburgh, so we're hoping to have some communications with him over the weekend. We're kind of expecting he'll be back next week.\"\n\nBell has yet to play this season, holding out initially for a new contract, and later to ensure that his body would be healthy when it came time for other teams to bid on him in the offseason. Thus far, Bell has missed 10 weeks of NFL action, losing out on over $8.5 million in game checks.\n\nWhile Bell was seen in Pittsburgh, after the runaround that he's given the Steelers all season so far, it's tough to guarantee Bell will be back with the team until he's literally in the locker room.\n\nAs things stand, Bell's long-term future with the team is up in the air. The Steelers will likely either place the transition tag on Bell, which would give the Steelers the option to match any offer Bell received, or let him go into free agency and pick up a compensatory pick should he leave the team.\n\nBut even more compelling is Bell's immediate future should he rejoin the Steelers this season. After a rough start to the year, Bell was openly trolling the team about his absence, but now Pittsburgh has won five straight games and looked in recent weeks as one of the most dominant offenses in the league.\n\nSecond-year running back James Conner stepped into Bell's role and has been a revelation \u2014 he's second in the NFL in rushing behind Todd Gurley and has already amassed 1,158 total yards and 11 touchdowns just halfway through the season. Supporting him is one of the most dangerous receiving corps in the country, with Antonio Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster both playing like studs and the tight end tandem of Vance McDonald and Jesse James both causing matchup problems for opposing defenses.\n\nShould Bell return to the Steelers roster, it's unclear where he'd fit into the team's attack.\n\nThere is no doubt Pittsburgh would find a way to make things work \u2014 most likely by reducing Conner's workload a bit to keep him fresh for what the Steelers hope is a deep run in the playoffs. But the chances are that Bell will have to work in to regain his spot in the locker room after skipping out on the team for half the year.\n\nAs things stand, the Steelers offense is moving just fine without him \u2014 Pittsburgh put on a show on Thursday night with a 52-21 win over the Carolina Panthers, scoring a touchdown of six of their eight first drives. If they can add Bell back into their lineup without disturbing the flow their offense has already hit, the Steelers could be marching towards another Super Bowl appearance.", "The flames from California's deadliest wildfire are beginning to retreat into forested, unpopulated areas of the state, but the death toll is still rising.\n\nEight victims of the Camp Fire were found Friday, bringing the total number of deaths from the fire in Northern California to 71.

Victoria's Secret currently stocks bra sizes 30A to 40DDD.\n\n\"If you're asking if we've considered putting a transgender model in the show or looked at putting a plus-size model in the show, we have. We invented the plus-size model show in what was our sister division, Lane Bryant,\" Razek said to Vogue.\n\nLane Bryant was formerly owned by L Brands but was bought by Charming Shoppes in 2001 and is now part of Ascena Retail Group.\n\n\"Lane Bryant still sells plus-size lingerie, but it sells a specific range, just like every specialty retailer in the world sells a range of clothing. As do we. We market to who we sell to, and we don't market to the whole world,\" Razek said.\n\nVictoria's Secret has frequently come under fire for excluding plus-size customers and only featuring rail-thin models in its ad campaigns.\n\nThat is to its detriment, analysts say. The store was once the kingpin of the US lingerie market, but in recent years it has lost market share to more body-positive brands, such as American Eagle's Aerie, which has seen explosive growth in recent years.

The Plus has a better speaker, and setting up my pre-existing smart home accessories with it was extremely easy.\n\nTo pair new accessories, all I had to to say was \"Alexa, discover devices,\" and wait a minute for the Echo Plus to scan my apartment. The new accessories would pop up, and I'd be all set. Some smart home tech, like Eufy's 30C smart vacuum, will still require downloading a separate app for setup, but many can be found automatically.\n\nAmazon recently released a second-generation Echo Plus, but it's $70 more expensive and not very different. It has a better speaker, the ability to be paired with a second Echo Plus for stereo sound, and a fabric-wrapped design that matches the aesthetic of Amazon's redesigned Echo.\n\nThese improvements are significant if you use the Echo as a standalone Bluetooth speaker, but they don't make a difference if you plan on pairing your Echo with an external speaker. There are no differences between the first and second-generation Echo Plus as a smart home hub.\n\nI paid $150 for the first-generation Echo Plus last year, and it was one of the best tech purchases I made in 2017.

Thankfully, it's one we've managed to master thus far, and a large part of our success lies in one particular thing we make time for: spending time apart.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that my partner and I were long-distance for much of our relationship, which meant that time apart wasn't just a preference, it was an unfortunate circumstance that was often painful and stressful. However, that mandatory time not being in one another's physical presence made taking time to do our own things once we were actually living together in the same place a pretty natural move.\n\nHere's why it works for us.\n\nWe can keep our own identities outside of the relationship\n\nThere's nothing worse than couples who slowly meld into one person because they're together 24/7 and have no separate hobbies, passions, or friends. Making sure to spend time apart allows us to do our own things, especially stuff the other person wouldn't be into. For my partner, that includes watching reality TV, listening to musical artists that I'm not into, and visiting with her friends.\n\nFor me, it's a lot of hanging out in local coffee shops, reading novels, and window shopping.

Sure, we don't have to be doing anything special to enjoy one another's company, but we find that doing these activities makes our bond even stronger.\n\nObviously there's a balance that needs to be struck here. While spending time away from your partner is something I believe is vital to every relationship, I'd be worried if I found myself wanting to be doing my own thing more than I wanted to be with her.

The mission of these unregistered foreign agents \u2014 that's what they are, unregistered agents \u2014 is to pressure this president into some kind of a deal.\"\n\nChinese officials have reportedly attempted to talk to some Wall Street titans about Trump's trade attacks against the country \u2014 specifically Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. While those attempts have yielded no results so far, Navarro views the Chinese discussions with Wall Street as shuttle diplomacy, which is conducted through a go-between.\n\n\"Wall Street, get out of those negotiations. Go to Dayton, Ohio \u2014 bring your Goldman Sachs money to Dayton, Ohio and invest in America,\" Navarro said. \"The president of the United States does not need shuttle diplomacy.\"\n\nTrump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet at the G20 summit at the end of November. Trump has been raising expectations of a possible deal, though experts are skeptical.\n\nNavarro warned that if Wall Street continues to inject itself into the US-China talks, any deal between the two countries would be tainted.\n\n\"If and when there is a deal, it will be on President Donald Trump's terms \u2014 not Wall Street's. If Wall Street is involved and continues to insinuate itself into these negotiation there will be a stench around any deal that is consummated,\" he said.\n\nRead more: Trump's suddenly talking about a big new trade deal with China, but analysts say it's just 'pre-election hype designed to make the markets happy'\u00bb\n\nThe talks come amid a growing trade war between the two countries.

China responded with tariffs of their own on $110 billion worth of US goods.\n\nNavarro praised Trump's handling of the trade fight.\n\n\"Donald Trump has done an amazing job of addressing that issue, and he didn't need the help of Wall Street.

Subscription-cost increases would likely come with that investment.\n\n\"I also think there's some pricing elasticity, too, but notably on the multichannel front,\" Iger said in response to an analyst question about Hulu. \"And I think there's an opportunity to improve \u2014 or, I should say, increase our pricing there.\"\n\nHulu offers streaming options from a base $7.99-a-month subscription that includes ads and access to a full content library to a $39.99-a-month plan that comes with multichannel, live TV.\n\nPricing elasticity on a product that costs $39.99 a month?\n\nWall Street and media analysts who monitor the industry don't think Iger's comments connect with the market dynamics they've seen.\n\n\"His comments are illogical given what we know about consumer media consumption these days,\" Alex DeGroote, an independent media analyst, told Business Insider. \"The market is experiencing downside pressure on all fees.\"\n\nThe pay-TV industry reported its worst quarter to date in the third quarter of 2018. And while vMVPDs, or digital-TV packages, previously helped to soften declining subscribers, their subscriber growth slowed. As a result, pay TV had a historically bad quarter, losing more than 1 million subscribers for the first time.\n\n\"Q3 is a record month for cord-cutting in the US. This shows where consumers are headed. Bundling is increasingly unattractive,\" DeGroote said.\n\nAmid the competitive over-the-top, or OTT, TV market, consumers are more motivated by price than by content when choosing a vMVPD, Greg Williams, an analyst at Cowen, told Business Insider. Cowen conducts a survey each quarter surveying a statistically comparable portion of the US population to understand consumer behavior.\n\n\"Our survey work shows customers adopt OTT for price, by far. Content and experience are distant second and third place. OTT is not about technology/experience, it's about price,\" he said.\n\nWhere does that leave Comcast?\n\nIger said Disney's decisions would be made with an \"eye toward being fiscally responsible\" to Hulu's minority shareholders. Hulu, a US streaming service with 20 million subscribers, shares ownership three ways: 60% Disney, 30% Comcast, and 10% AT&T.\n\nComcast has a decision to make.\n\nIt currently has ownership of two OTT services through its stake in Hulu and its newly acquired Now TV, Sky's OTT platform. If Comcast chooses to stay a minority stakeholder in Hulu, it forces Disney to continue on its two-path solution with Hulu and Disney+ as separate entities. But that also means Comcast would directly compete against itself. Williams thinks Comcast could still sell its Hulu stake, especially in light of comments made by management that Comcast will push Now TV into new countries.\n\nComcast bought Sky for $39 billion, leading some in the industry to say it overpaid for the British broadcaster. Selling its Hulu stake could help defray this cost.\n\n\"Comcast needs to reduce its leverage following the Sky deal,\" DeGroote said. \"Being a minority Hulu holder is unsatisfactory and uneconomic.\"\n\nThe cable giant has made it clear that it isn't looking to join the list of companies offering OTT services. Perhaps another option will emerge.\n\nAT&T's WarnerMedia has approached Comcast to discuss the possibility of working together on WarnerMedia's forthcoming streaming service, The Information's Jessica Toonkel reported. Among the topics reportedly discussed was the opportunity to license NBCUniversal films and TV.\n\n\"They could build the anti-Hulu,\" Williams said.", "Disruptions to Global Positioning System signals have been reported in northern Norway and Finland this month, overlapping with the final days of NATO's exercise Trident Juncture, a massive military exercise that has drawn Russia's ire.\n\nA press officer for Wider\u00f8e, a Norway-based airline operating in the Nordics, told The Barents Observer at the beginning of November that pilots reported the loss of GPS while flying into airports in the northern Norwegian region of Finnmark, near the Russian border, though the officer stressed that pilots had alternative systems and there were no safety risks.\n\nNorway's aviation authority, Avinor, issued a notice to airmen of irregular navigation signals in airspace over eastern Finnmark between October 30 and November 7, according to The Observer.\n\nDisruptions to GPS signals in Lapland in Finland and Finnmark in Norway were reported in late October and early November.

As the damaged dock sank to the depths, two large cranes fell on the aircraft carrier, tearing a substantial 200-square-foot hole in the vessel.\n\nRussian officials initially said the accident would not delay efforts to repair the Russian Navy's flagship, which returned from Syria spewing black smoke after losing two of its aircraft to tragic accidents, but it appears that the loss of the critical PD-50 dry dock may be a serious setback. The overhaul was expected to be finished in 2021, but it is unlikely that the country will be able to meet that deadline.\n\nRussia has found viable alternatives to the sunken dry dock for almost all of its naval vessels, but not for the Kuznetsov, officials now admit.\n\n\"We have alternatives actually for all the ships except for [the aircraft carrier] Admiral Kuznetsov,\" Alexei Rakhmanov, head of the United Shipbuilding Corporation, told the state-run TASS news agency Wednesday. \"As for the ships of the first rank ... the Admiral Kuznetsov, [the loss of the PD-50 floating dock] creates certain inconveniences.\"\n\n\"We hope the issue of the docking of first-rank ships will be resolved in the near future,\" he added, noting that the country is investigating other alternatives. The Kuznetsov is reportedly sitting at the 35th Ship Repair Plant. The PD-1 dock at the Severodvinsk shipyard was initially mentioned as a possible alternative, but it was later determined that the facility could not handle a ship of that size. Russia is believed to be looking seriously at trying to refloat the sunken dock.\n\nThe Diplomat reports that Russia lacks any acceptable alternative to the PD-50, which would take six months to a year to recover. The operation would likely require international support, which it does not seem likely to receive. And given the country's souring relations with its European neighbors, Moscow probably can't count on Sweden building it another dry dock.\n\nThe loss of the PD-50 dry dock and the ensuing damage to the Kuznetsov begs the question of whether it is even worth it to salvage its carrier program given its poor performance record and unreliability, The War Zone assesses.

That's part of the reason Nicole Wegman started Ring Concierge on Instagram in 2013 \u2014 to create bespoke engagement rings for women, by women.\n\nNow, Wegman and her NYC-based team of six sell hundreds of engagement rings a year. The fin-jewelry business specializes in custom engagement rings that start at $10,000 and can go into the six figures. For comparison, the average cost of an engagement ring in the US is $6,000, Wegman told Business Insider.\n\nWegman said the biggest decision behind each ring is, unsurprisingly, the diamond itself \u2014 but that people come in with certain misconceptions, too.\n\n\"The biggest misconception is, people will come in and say, 'I did research online and I read about the four C's and I think I need to have a colorless diamond with barely any inclusion,'\" Wegman said.\n\nRead more: Millennial attitudes are forcing a massive change in the diamond industry\n\nThe four C's refer to a diamond's cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. Diamond clarity reflects a lack of blemishes or inclusions, which many stones naturally have. The GIA International Diamond Grading System assigns grades that range from flawless to obvious inclusions, which affects the stone's value.\n\n\"In reality, I always suggest dropping lower in color and clarity and allocating a bit more of the budget toward carat weight,\" she continued.\n\nPart of the Ring Concierge experience is a one-on-one meeting with Wegman and her team, whether that is in person or remotely. Wegman sees clients that come in and request a specific grade of diamond with a set budget. But when they try on the diamond they think they want, she said they are often times underwhelmed.\n\n\"They say 'this isn't as big as I thought it was going to be.' And I'm like, 'you know what, for the same price you can get a three-carat diamond if you're just a little more flexible with color and clarity,'\" Wegman said.\n\nCreating a ring that suits the client's tastes \u2014 and their lifestyle\n\nOnce a diamond is chosen, Wegman works with clients to understand how the ring will be worn to create a setting that is fashionable, durable, and timeless \u2014 but also lifestyle-appropriate.\n\n\"Let's say they want the thinnest possible ring covered in diamonds ... but they have three kids, they go to the gym every day, and they never take their ring off. That's probably not the best decision,\" Wegman said. \"That's too delicate a ring for your lifestyle. So, we'll think of ways to get them that look they want, but cater towards the way they are going to be wearing it.\"\n\nWegman added: \"We like to get clients the most bang for their buck without sacrificing the look of the ring. So, we like to find ways to drop down on the paperwork a little bit, not have it impact the diamond visually, and then just get them a large carat weight \u2014 which, ultimately, the women want.\"", "Since Tuesday, Florida, Georgia, and Arizona have become mired in controversy over uncounted votes.\n\nBut nowhere is the chaos more dramatic than in Florida, where two major Democratic-leaning South Florida counties \u2014 Broward and Palm Beach \u2014 are still tallying thousands of votes as the margin between the Senate and gubernatorial candidates approaches the recount threshold:\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bill Nelson has not conceded to his Republican challenger, Gov. Rick Scott, though Scott declared victory on Tuesday night.\n\nIn the governor's race, Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, conceded on Tuesday night. But since then, the Republican Ron DeSantis' lead has fallen to a margin of 0.44 percentage points, just below the automatic recount threshold. On Thursday, Gillum's campaign indicated it was \"ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount.\"\n\nRepublicans are charging that elections officials in the two counties have a record of \"incompetence and irregularities in vote tabulations\" and pointing to a recent court ruling that Brenda Snipes, the Broward County elections supervisor, oversaw the illegal destruction of votes in a 2016 congressional contest.

The US troops also faced terrifying Banzai charges as Japanese forces poured onto the island. The Japanese made regular attempts to retake key strategic positions, but US troops stopped them in their tracks.\n\nThe US Navy ultimately took back control of the surrounding waterway, and the Japanese secretly retreated.\n\nThe Marines, together with the Army, achieved a great victory, successfully ending Japan's southward expansion. The US Marines lost more than 1,500 men. The Japanese lost tens of thousands.\n\nAfter the battle, a victory that turned the tide of the war for the allies, Japanese Major Gen.

Lhota said in a statement that he had taken a second term for \"the sole purpose of halting the decline of service\" in New York's transit system. During his most recent term, which was set to end in 2021, he had faced questions about potential conflicts of interest arising from other positions he maintained while serving as the MTA's chairman.\n\nThe MTA is responsible for New York's public transit system, including the subway, which has become increasingly unreliable due to decades of inadequate investment, an outdated signaling system, track fires, and overcrowding.\n\nIn 2017, the MTA began working on an $800 million rescue plan that included urgent track and signal repairs. Lhota said in his statement that in September, there were fewer train delays than at any point since February 2016.\n\nIn May, New York City Transit Authority president Andy Byford unveiled a plan to repair and modernize the New York City subway system. The plan, called \"Fast Forward,\" would replace an antiquated signal system, redesign the way passengers pay fares, increase the number of subway cars, and install elevators at stations. It would also include station repairs, an increased number of buses, and redesigned bus routes.\n\nByford said the plan would cost about $40 billion, according to Gothamist.\n\nTransit projects in New York are far more expensive than those in comparable cities throughout the world partly because of generous compensation for workers and high costs from contractors, both of whom are allowed to negotiate their rates without input from any New York City agencies.\n\nThe Times has previously estimated that upgrading the signaling system for every subway line could take 50 years and cost $20 billion.\n\nYou can read Lhota's full statement below:", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Last week, the company reported that systemwide same-stores sales in US Applebee's locations increased 5.5% for the first nine months of the year.\n\nThe Dollar L.I.T. followed in the Dollarita's footsteps. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nThe Dollarita was the game changer Applebee's needed. Joyce said the deal was seen as a risk internally, with some franchisees feeling reluctant to adopt the dollar-drink deal. In New York City, for example, few restaurants decided to add the Dollarita to the menu in October 2017.\n\n\"You worry about, do you attract the wrong element, do people come in and get soused, do they not order food?\" Joyce said.\n\nA franchisee in Texas who had already rolled out the Dollarita in restaurants, however, convinced others that the deal was worth a shot. And, he was quickly proved right.\n\n\"Ninety-eight percent of the people who came in and ordered those, ordered food,\" Joyce said. \"Most of the people would have one of those and then move upscale to another cocktail.\"\n\nFollowing the success of the Dollarita, Applebee's has rolled out one- or two-dollar drink deals every month, doubling down on buzzy deals to attract budget shoppers.\n\n\"It got buzz going,\" Joyce said.\n\n\"On social media initially, back in early October, people said, 'Well I don't like Applebee's but dollar margaritas, I'm in!'\" he continued. \"And people were upset, and I'm like, get them in the restaurant, serve them well, give them great food, and guess what?

Don't you dare sneeze on me!\n\nDo you know how far your germs can travel?\n\nNormally, you hold about half a liter of fluid in your lungs. So when you sneeze, you're able to spray as much as a water bottle's worth of mucus into the air around you.\n\nIt shoots out of your mouth in the form of moist, germ-infested sheets, traveling at up to to 35 meters per second. That's fast enough to give you a speeding ticket on a highway. Once that sheet hits the air, it expands, breaking up into snotty strings, then a series of different-sized droplets all trapped in a turbulent gas cloud.\n\nOne brave group at MIT discovered that the biggest droplets can travel up to 2 meters- about the distance between your desk and two desks down.\n\nBut most other droplets? Those travel much farther- up to 8 meters. That's about 5 desk lengths!\n\nNot only that: The germ-infested gas cloud is less dense than the air around it. So, it rises upwards, right to where ventilation systems and other people's unsuspecting noses and mouths await. And even though these are relatively smaller droplets, they're probably still teeming with harmful pathogens, like the flu virus. Even worse \u2014 depending on ventilation \u2014 they can spread through a room in just a few seconds, and remain suspended for up to 10 minutes!\n\nNow, if you happen to notice someone around you sneeze or cough, you can hold your breath as you move out of range. But during flu season, that might not be enough, because there are danger zones everywhere- specifically on surfaces like desks, door knobs, and especially steel handrails.\n\nTurns out, the flu virus has been found to survive for 24 hours on a steel surface, and if you touch that surface and don't wash your hands before eating, you may have just gotten infected.\n\nSo, let's say you show up to work sick with the flu one day, and you start to sneeze. Now, according to one study, you'll probably infect 1 to 2 other people. You're clearly showing symptoms of the flu. However, it takes a few days for symptoms to show up in the other people you infect. So, those poor souls unknowingly also come to work sick over the next few days and potentially infect 1 or 2 more people. In an office of 100 desks, this could mean 10 or 15 sick people by the end of two weeks! That's over 10% of the office.\n\nAnd all of it started with just one sick person: You. All thanks to the germ-laden cloud you so generously shared.\n\nSo, next time you're not feeling great, and sneezing up a storm, think about your poor coworkers and take a sick day for yourself.

Check.\n\nBefore I travel, I usually research which unique foods are revered by the culture I'm visiting. When I began researching for a trip to Bali, a gorgeous Indonesian island in Southeast Asia, I found that the most talked about local specialty was kopi luwak.\n\nKopi luwak is coffee made from coffee cherries that have been eaten, digested, and defecated by the Asian palm civet, a small mammal that looks like a cross between a cat and a raccoon. The beans are then cleaned and processed. In the West, kopi luwak has become known as \"cat poop coffee.\"\n\nWith prices ranging between $35 and $100 a cup, or about $100 to $600 a pound, kopi luwak is widely considered to be the most expensive coffee in the world.\n\nCivet dung is prepared during the production of Civet coffee, the world's most expensive coffee at Bondowoso on August 11, 2009 in East Java, near Surabaya, Indonesia. Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images\n\nIndonesian coffee producers have claimed for generations that the kopi luwak method produces the best tasting coffee in the world. There are a few reasons for that.\n\nOne, the civet is apparently a highly picky eater and will only eat the best, most ripe coffee cherries. Two, the animals' digestive enzymes \"change the structure of proteins in the coffee beans, which removes some of the acidity to make a smoother cup of coffee,\" according to National Geographic. And three, digestion removes all the fruit pulp that sometimes gets left on the bean during processing.\n\nBut there are a few very big catches.\n\nIncreased demand for kopi luwak has changed the industry \u2014 for the worse\n\nWhen, in decades past, kopi luwak was simply an Indonesian specialty, it was almost exclusively produced by wild civets. The animals would graze in the wilderness, picking the choicest cherries at their leisure, and coffee producers would hunt for the dung.\n\nBut ever since coffee expert Tony Wild introduced kopi luwak to the West in the early 1990s as the coffee director of Taylors of Harrogate, all that's changed. There's now a huge demand for the specialty coffee. It's stocked at luxury retailers all over the world, production has expanded to China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines, and, in Indonesia, it's one of the biggest delicacies marketed to tourists.\n\nAs you can imagine, it's not wild civets producing the kopi luwak anymore. While there are still some wild civet operations, the vast majority of kopi luwak is made from civets that have been captured and put in cages on giant plantations.\n\n\"Similar to foie gras geese, they're basically force-fed coffee berries,\" Suwanna Gauntlett, founder of Wildlife Alliance, a conservation group, told Globalpost in 2016.\n\nRead More: I've been traveling the world for 6 months, and I've found real life doesn't always live up to the hype. These are the most disappointing places I've been\n\nA caretaker feeds coffee seeds to a civet cat inside a 'Kopi Luwak' or Civet coffee farm and cafe on May 27, 2013 in Tampaksiring, Bali, Indonesia. Nicky Loh/Getty Images for World Animal Protection\n\nAs Wild wrote in a 2013 column calling for an end to kopi luwak, civets \"suffer greatly\" from being caged. Naturally solitary, the civets suffer stress when living in close proximity to each other, have numerous health problems due to the coffee-cherry diet, chew on their own legs, and often die.\n\nEven if you don't care about animal welfare, there's the reality that the coffee just doesn't taste that good. Many say that kopi luwak was discovered during Dutch colonial rule, when Indonesian farmers were barred from harvesting coffee cherries for their own use. They had to scrounge around to get beans. The dung of the wild civet supposedly provided a shortcut to high-quality, cleaned coffee cherries free from the mold or decay that would've been common at the time.\n\nBut any premium coffee you get at your local coffee shop comes from cherries processed via far more advanced methods than kopi luwak and from uniformly ripe, high-quality cherries, according to Nordic Coffee Culture.\n\nKopi luwak at Satu Satu cafe. Harrison Jacobs/Business Insider\n\nI tried kopi luwak sourced from a family farm \u2014 and it was nothing special\n\nWhen I got to Bali, I visited the Satu Satu Caf\u00e9 in Canggu, a small coastal town. Satu Satu sources its kopi luwak from owner Eddie Sudana's six-acre family farm. It's reputed to be one of the few places that still sources its beans from cage-free, wild civets.\n\nI figured if I had to try kopi luwak, at least I could do it at a place that makes it ethically. It wasn't even that expensive. If I remember correctly, it was only about 30-40% more than the regular coffee at Satu Satu.\n\nI love coffee. Espresso, French press, Aeropress, cold-brew, pour-over \u2014 I drink it all. The kopi luwak was nothing special. It tasted slightly smoother than your average diner cup of joe, but not better than ones I've had at any coffee shop worth its salt. And there was a gritty, overly earthy flavor.\n\nTo be honest, I've made better cups of coffee in my Aeropress. At this point in time, drinking kopi luwak is more about being able to tell your friends you drank the most expensive coffee in the world than some amazing delicacy.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

And Dark Horse Comics, whose most popular property is \"Hellboy,\" announced this year a service called Dark Horse Direct, which will focus on selling merchandise.\n\n\"The goal is getting our products into as many hands a possible,\" Melissa Lomax, the director of e-commerce for Dark Horse, told The New York Times in July.\n\nIf you apply that philosophy to the entire comic-book industry \u2014 getting the products into as many hands as possible \u2014 that's what Comixology is all about, according to CEO David Steinberger.\n\n\"Our mission at Comixology is to make everyone on the planet a comics fan,\" Steinberger told Business Insider. \"We now lead digital comics worldwide for Amazon.\"\n\nEven though the publishers mentioned each have their own online services of some kind, they still see the value of working with Comixology.

But comic creators and industry experts came to Comixology's defense.\n\nSome background: Comixology sponsored the programming at this year's Small Press Expo in Bethesda, Maryland and offered free copies of its comics history book, \"Hit Reblog,\" which collects early web comics. The Comics Journal wrote \"Amazon has proven time and again to be a straight-up reprehensible company\" and \"Comixology Originals and 'Hit Reblog' is doing what the tech industry almost always does \u2014 taking something that already exists and making it worse.\"\n\nSpike Trotman, a cartoonist with a Comixology Original mini-series called \"Delver,\" tweeted in response, \"deciding Amazon's sponsorship of SPX-- which, again, they've *already been doing for years anyway*-- is somehow the first step in their nefarious SPX takeover plot isn't just alarmist as hell, but utterly discounts decades of precedent.\" (You can read the full thread here.)\n\nComics journalist Brigid Alverson wrote in a blog post, \"Comixology Originals pays creators to make original comics, which makes a lot of sense in that context, because some of those young creators will grow up to be wildly successful authors, making lots of books that people will buy on Amazon. That's the sort of long-term thinking that frankly, we could use more of. I don't think this is part of Jeff Bezos' strategy, of course, but I do think the Comixology folks are strongly motivated by a love of comics as both a medium and a business.\"\n\nRichard Starkings, creator of the Comixology Original \"Elephentmen,\" which had previously been published by Image, told Business Insider that it's \"inevitable\" for the comics industry to flirt with digital, and that it will only help the print business.\n\n\"The beauty of Comixology is that your catalog can stay in digital for a long, long time, especially if you're the rights holder,\" Starkings said. \"We didn't used to have that. The beauty of digital, everything stays.\"\n\nHe added: \"20 years ago there were 10,000 comic book shops. We have maybe 1,600 to 2,000 now? But I think you'll see a growth in comic-book stores. You have to be close to a hobby to enjoy it and once you're enjoying it you want more of it.\"\n\nComixology Unlimited The future is now\n\nSteinberger wouldn't reveal how many subscribers Comixology has (except that \"half of our new buyers are coming in through the Unlimited program, which is what we want\"). But mobile-app analysis company Sensor Tower provided Business Insider with a look at how many times the Comixology app had been installed since 2014 on Google Play and the App Store.\n\nAccording to Sensor Tower, the app has been downloaded 7 million times in the last four years, with the US accounting for 41% of installations. India is the app's second-largest market at 11%.\n\nThis past year saw 2.1 million installations (October 2017 to October 2018), which is 22% higher than the previous period between October 2016 and October 2017. Most of that increase came internationally, particularly in India.\n\nThere aren't many similar apps to compare this to, but it falls in the ballpark of the apps for Marvel and DC Comics, which have been downloaded 8.2 million and 4.2 million times, respectively, according to Sensor Tower.\n\nAs Comixology beefs up its unlimited plan and original comics, an increase is likely \u2014 especially with Amazon in its corner. Amazon has zeroed in on video in recent years, going to head-to-head with Netflix as a streaming service with Amazon Prime Video, and distributing some critically acclaimed films like \"Manchester By the Sea\" through Amazon Studios.\n\nIt makes sense that Amazon would take advantage of the original stories in Comixology's library and develop them into TV or films in the future. Amazon has first-look deals on every Comixology Original.\n\n\"I think part of the reason creators like to work with us is that there is a direct line to being able to be looked at for something in Prime Originals,\" Steinberger said.\n\nDoes Starkings ever imagine his comics adapted for the screen?\n\n\"You ask any creative that question they'll always give you same answer: Yes,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Disney revealed new details about its Netflix competitor, Disney+, including 'Star Wars' and Marvel TV shows\n\nAmazon isn't the only major company that could move the industry in a new direction. Netflix acquired comics publisher Millarworld last year in an exclusive deal to develop TV shows based on Millarworld comics (which are included on Comixology), and even Spotify partnered with Nerdist to offer \"Archie\" motion comics this year (\"I have yet to see [a motion comic] that makes reading better or tells a better story ... But I love the idea that we and others get to experiment,\" Steinberger said).\n\nComixology doesn't see these emerging platforms as competition, but partnerships \u2014 its main focus is comics, and making them accessible for readers new and old. That means comics of all kinds, and Comixology is in the process of translating over 30 volumes of Japanese manga for the Unlimited service that have never been released in the English language before. The real competition would be with a platform that wanted to host an exclusive library of original comics digitally, like DC Universe.\n\nThe comic business is in a constant state of flux, but with more and more companies investing in the industry, the future \u2014and the present \u2014 look bright.\n\n\"The first time I ever saw someone reading a comic in public was on a subway train in New York, and it was on an iPad,\" Starkings said. \"When I saw that, I thought 'the future is now,' and that was five years ago. To me it's not the future, it's the past and the present.\"\n\nIf you have any tips or insight on Comixology, contact the author at tclark@businessinsider.com.", "Spain is on track to have the world's longest life expectancy by 2040 with a lifespan of 85.8 years, surpassing Japan.\n\nA report from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which formed in 2007 with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, found that Japan will fall to second place with a life expectancy of 85.7 years.

After starting 0-for-9 on the night, Anthony's 1-of-11 shooting performance accounted for the second-worst showing of his career.\n\nOklahoma City downed the Rockets \u2014 who were considered one of the top teams in the NBA to start the season \u2014 98-80 with star point guard Russell Westbrook sitting on the bench with an injury.

Look, I don't think he's a smart person, but he's got a loud voice.\"\n\nIn addition, Trump went after Ryan \u2014 a correspondent for the American Urban Radio Networks and a CNN contributor \u2014 who has similarly been aggressive in her questioning of the president.\n\n\"The same thing with April Ryan,\" Trump said. \"I watch her get up. I mean, you talk about somebody that's a loser. She doesn't know what the hell she's doing. She gets publicity and then she gets a pay raise or a contract with, I think, CNN. But she's very nasty.\"\n\nThe attacks are another chapter in Trump's drawn-out attacks on the press. The president previously called the press the \"enemy of the people\" and attempted to undermine reporting with which he does not agree.\n\nAcosta's White House press credential was suspended after the encounter with Trump on Wednesday after the White House claimed that the reporter \"laid hands\" on a White House intern who was trying to grab the microphone away.

The report also outlined the company's dip in Comscore traffic and challenges growing its advertising business, which relies on selling advertisers sponsored content that mimics editorial articles.\n\nIn short, living up to its eye-popping $5.7 billion valuation is proving to be a challenge for Vice. On Thursday, Disney, which is one of Vice's biggest backers, said it had taken a $157 million write-down on its original $400 million investment, equivalent to a 40% decline.\n\nRead more: At Vice Media's once high-flying ad agency Carrot, a founder is out and insiders describe a hostile culture toward women\n\nLike other digital publishers, advertising has historically made up the bulk of Vice Media's revenue, but the company's business is split up between web publishing, a TV channel run with A&E Networks, licensing, and an advertising agency.\n\nFor the web-publishing business, traffic is down and the company is reportedly considering folding several of its sites together. On the TV side, Vice's weekly news show on HBO is winding down this year and the company is prepping a new live nightly show called \"Viceland Live\" for its Viceland channel. And the agency business that once contained several ad agencies is now consolidated into one umbrella organization called Virtue Worldwide.\n\nDubuc is trying to turn things around. Through a hiring freeze and attrition, Vice Media plans to slim down its staff by 10% to 15%, per The Journal's sources.\n\n\"They need to rightsize their business \u2014 that is muddied by the promises that they made to investors and the promises that they didn't deliver on to other investors,\" said Ian Schafer, a former agency exec who founded ad agency Deep Focus.\n\nAnother media-buyer source at a large agency suggested that the combination of the new hiring freeze, the dip in traffic, and the company's cultural reputation had put Vice Media at a tipping point with advertisers.\n\n\"The bluff and hype that fueled the business has finally caught up, and now the skepticism many advertisers had is proven justified,\" the buyer said. \"Adults are now in the room at Vice and uncovering what many have suspected for years.\"\n\nVice Media pushed back on the narrative that its web business is struggling.\n\n\"At a time of seismic change across the media landscape, Vice has never been better positioned to continue its remarkable growth, further cementing its status as one the most impactful and innovative youth brands worldwide,\" the company's board of directors said in a statement. \"From its deep library of critically-acclaimed programming, to its diversified revenue streams and channels across digital, mobile, television, film and branded content, Vice's audience has never been bigger, more global, more diverse or younger.\"\n\nVice Media needs a turnaround story \u2014 particularly for advertisers\n\nOver the past few years, Vice Media has increasingly moved into television and entertainment to diversify its revenue while also running more than a dozen web properties. In addition to running the \"Viceland\" cable channel, there's also an arm of its business called Vice Studios that makes content for networks like HBO and BBC.\n\nMeanwhile, the web-publishing business that turned Vice Media into a sprawling media giant is losing some of its reach.\n\nAccording to Comscore, Vice Media's sites reached 27 million unique visitors in September, which is a year-over-year increase from 20 million but a drop from 49.1 million in March 2016.\n\nIn addition to its own web properties, Vice Media handles ad sales for other websites that are pulled into its monthly total numbers, including Ranker, Snopes, and Metalinjection.net. With traffic from those sites included, Vice Media's total reach hit 68.5 million monthly uniques in September, according to Comscore.\n\nVice Media has far more competition than it did a few years ago\n\nSimilar to other digital-media companies like BuzzFeed, Refinery29, and Vox Media, Vice Media leaned heavily into branded content and making custom digital ads that looked like editorial content for brands.\n\nAdvertisers have since cooled on some types of branded content, and publishers are revamping their businesses with more data and measurement options for advertisers.\n\nA few years ago, Vice Media was seen as one of a handful of go-to publishers for reaching millennials. But today, marketers are spreading their ad budgets out to other channels \u2014 like influencer marketing \u2014 to reach younger consumers and are looking for solid results from their campaigns, Schafer said.\n\n\"Brands felt that Vice was a shortcut for both creative services and ad inventory to reaching what was becoming an increasingly hard-to-reach demo,\" he said. \"Vice became the default for that for a period of time, and that's when they were riding the most high.\"\n\nNow, Vice is stretched between proving to investors that it can be financially stable and keeping up with a changing advertising industry that's dealing with major trends like in-housing, a shift towards data-driven advertising, and the growing threat of Facebook and Google.\n\n\"If you're trying to save your company or preserve a valuation at the same time as you're trying to be everything that advertisers want, you might find that those two things don't meet,\" Schafer said. \"That's a tough pill to swallow.\"\n\nIts agency business is one bright spot\n\nMeanwhile, Dubuc is working to turn around Vice Media's culture after an investigative piece from The New York Times in December 2017 looked at the company's problematic culture. A number of women from Vice Media's now defunct ad agency Carrot described a string of sexual misconduct at the company. Carrot has since been folded into the company's in-house advertising agency, Virtue.\n\nThe agency is one bright spot that Dubuc talked about at a board meeting, according to The Journal. Virtue, which is 12 years old, has made both sponsored content for brands and provided more traditional advertising services, like branding and production.\n\nShifting from an ad-supported business to either an agency or licensing business will be tough, according to sources.\n\n\"It's difficult to see how Vice will sustain an ad business unless they merge with a more established player or focus on building new advertiser-friendly products,\" the media buyer source said.\n\nSchafer pointed out that Vice Media has strong investigative content in its HBO show and its written journalism, but linear programming doesn't monetize the same way.\n\n\"I thought they had built a successful, great brand identity, but I'm not sure if they succeeded in building a really great brand.\"", "Don't get caught paying luggage fees you weren't expecting.

This suggests that it's only a matter of time before the Chinese tech giant eclipses traditional app stores.\n\nAs WeChat mini programs grow, consumers will likely start turning to the platform over traditional app stores, as mini programs provide unique benefits:\n\nMini programs don't require the storage space that traditional app store experiences do. Mini programs run on the cloud, meaning that they don't require a separate download and, in turn, don't take up the memory that apps downloaded from app stores do.\n\nThey enable users to more conveniently switch between smartphone activities.

A comeback, the American knows, means a money fight, something Mayweather knows plenty about.\n\nThe 41-year-old retired for the first time in 2007 after he flattened British fighter Ricky Hatton with a highlight-reel check hook in the 10th round.\n\nBut he only stayed retired for two years as he returned to boxing for a ruck against the expert counterpuncher Juan Manuel Marquez, whom he dominated with an impressive ease in 2009. Marquez was a lighter opponent but Mayweather looked as good as he ever had, before romping to a succession of clear-cut wins over some of the sport's biggest names like Shane Mosley, Miguel Cotto, Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez, and Manny Pacquiao.\n\nIn a wildly successful comeback, he won five world championship titles in two weight classes and earned over $600 million in just ten fights\u2014 more than he had in his previous 39 bouts. It was like he had never been away.\n\nBut then he went away again. He retired after he outclassed an inferior opponent in Andre Berto, a bout that earned him $32 million, and this time it appeared he would retire for good. Before the start of the 12th round, supposedly the final time Mayweather would ever sit on a stool during professional combat, he gave a passionate, teary-eyed speech to his father and head coach, Floyd Mayweather Sr., before fighting the final round of his life \u2014 his swansong.\n\nThat was it. Mayweather called the curtain on an illustrious career at 49-0, at 38 years old, in 2015.\n\nMayweather is past his prime\n\nOnly, that wasn't it. There was one more fight to come, as an opportunity presented itself that would guarantee Mayweather would dwarf his previous fight salary. That opportunity was Conor McGregor, the mixed martial artist with a gift of the gab, verbal jabs, and a lethal left cross that had concussed many an opponent in the UFC.\n\nMayweather retired for the third time in 2017, after he labored to a 10th round stoppage victory over McGregor. It was a big-money win, a jackpot that scooped him $275 million, but Mayweather looked poor. McGregor, a boxing novice who had never once fought a professional four-round fight let alone a championship 12-rounder, hung in there until the 10th, and landed 111 punches in the process, more than any other opponent had landed on Mayweather before.\n\nYes, Mayweather eventually got the job done, but he did so while looking old and past his prime against a novice. It became clear that it's unlikely he'd be able to compete against active and elite boxers like Errol Spence Jr., Terence Crawford, or \"Canelo\" Alvarez.\n\nMayweather, unsurprisingly, hung up his gloves at 50-0 and became boxing's first billion dollar fighter. Unbeaten throughout his entire professional career, he left with barely a scratch on his face, having earned more money than any other boxer. He revolutionised the pay-per-view landscape and flew into the sunset, on his terms, as a filthy-rich winner. Boxing? Mayweather completed it.\n\nHe now has the Mayweather Boxing Club in Las Vegas, a strip club called Girl Collection, a garage filled with rare million dollar cars, a \"Billionaire\" watch worth $18 million, luxurious mansions, and two private jets. He even flew one of those planes to the other side of the planet just to take an Instagram photo earlier this year.\n\n'Becoming a farce'\n\nStill, that doesn't appear to be enough for Mayweather, who clearly wants to fight once more.\n\nHe announced a rematch with his former opponent Pacquiao at a nightclub in Japan two months ago, told TMZ Sports in October that he was \"absolutely\" fighting the UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, and then held a press conferance to confirm a comeback against the relatively obscure Rizin kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa, a 20-year-old who likes anime, aliens, and Harry Potter. Within days, he claimed he was \"blindsided\" and pulled the plug on the December 31 show in Saitama City.\n\nAs Shannon Sharpe, the popular panelist on \"Skip and Shannon: Undisputed,\" said on Fox Sports 1: \"These things are becoming a farce.\"\n\nFormer UFC middleweight Chael Sonnen said in a Twitter video that Mayweather is \"watering down\" his own brand, and Ariel Helwani, the respected MMA journalist for ESPN, called it \"embarrassing.\"\n\nMayweather should stay retired. Photo by Harry How/Getty Images\n\nThe fight game is littered with great athletes who take one fight too many as some boxers just don't know when to call it quits.\n\nThe former three-time heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali \"retired\" after he avenged his previous defeat to Leon Spinks by beating him in front of 70,000 fans in Louisana in 1978. Ali should have stayed retired, but an $8 million offer lured him into a fight against jab maestro Larry Holmes two years later. Ali, showing signs of trembling hands and stuttering speech, was obliterated in 10 rounds by Holmes. That should have been enough, but Ali still refused to accept the call of retirement and fought Trevor Berbick in 1981, losing by unanimous decision.\n\nAnd Ali is not alone.\n\nFormer \"Baddest Man on the Planet\" Mike Tyson didn't know when to call it quits as he was embarrassed in three of his last four fights. His 2004 and 2005 losses to Danny Williams and Kevin McBride would likely have been reversed had he fought them earlier in his career, but Tyson took the fights, lost badly, and ended his career on a low.\n\nEven Roy Jones Jr., the fabulously-athletic sharpshooter, should have retired for good when he won a heavyweight world title having begun his career as a junior middleweight. But after his landmark 2003 decision win over John Ruiz, he lost eight times in 15 years and his record, and legacy, has suffered as a result.\n\nMayweather could end up as boxing's next cautionary tale. The man has been fighting's biggest box office attraction for over a decade, but his magic act is stale. It is time for him to disappear into retirement forever.\n\nIf he doesn't, he will likely keep returning until one day he loses. Then, his record, that undefeated and unbeatable legacy he has built since 1998, will be lost forever.\n\nThat would be a crying shame \u2014 but the one crying would be Mayweather.", "Everyone and their grandmother knows all about Facebook.

The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the DOJ is trying to determine whether Tesla made projections in 2017 about Model 3 production that it knew it would not be able to achieve.

Kicking things off the night before Thanksgiving will make this Walmart's earliest Black Friday start ever, but it's also currently offering deals as a sort of preview. Amazon and Best Buy also have Black Friday deals available already, while online deals at Kohl's start on November 19 and Target's online deals will be available to REDcard holders November 21.\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nRetailers are getting an early jump on Black Friday to capture this holiday season's projected $124 billion in US online sales, which is expected to be dominated by Thanksgiving Weekend. Thanksgiving Weekend, which runs from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday and includes Black Friday, is forecast to rack up $23.4 billion in US online sales, 19% of the whole season's expected total.\n\nBy offering Black Friday-branded deals prior to Black Friday, retailers might be able to excite consumers and encourage them to spend as much as they would on the actual sales holiday, in turn boosting their performances. Retailers that start Black Friday early have a chance of being top of mind when Black Friday actually starts, securing more sales on a key day.\n\nInvesting in Black Friday e-commerce is wise since many consumers now avoid shopping on the sales holiday, likely because of the overwhelming in-store experience. Stores on Black Friday can create a frantic and stressful experience for shoppers, which may be why 60% of US consumers said Black Friday has become more overwhelming, and why 48% said they hate shopping that day.\n\nConsumers' continued interest in Cyber Monday \u2014 only 25% hate shopping that day \u2014 suggests that they're still interested in online deals, just not the in-store atmosphere. So, emphasizing online sales during Black Friday can help retailers maximize the day's value even as many consumers look to avoid stores.\n\nThe focus on e-commerce for the holidays has caused retailers to expand the availability of free shipping. Seventy-nine percent of consumers said free shipping would make them more likely to shop online, according to a report from Walker Sands, which is 25% more than any other listed option.\n\nOffering free shipping to more consumers can therefore help retailers secure more e-commerce sales over the holidays. This is likely why Target, Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy have all made free shipping more available for just the holiday season. It's possible that Target will benefit most because it's offering free two-day shipping with no order minimum, making it the most attractive option outside of Amazon's pre-existing Prime delivery offerings.", "Apple has an all-new MacBook Air in 2018.\n\nThough it's received plenty of internal upgrades over the years, Apple actually hadn't touched the MacBook Air design since 2010.

Big players, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have long made fintech investments, and some have even acquired fintechs for their digital transformation.\n\nHowever, smaller regional banks often don't have the necessary time and budget to research suitable fintech partners to transform their businesses. By working together with others that have similar pain points, it is more likely that they will find the right opportunities that will help them to revamp their conventional services.\n\nSmaller banks and fintechs could be winning partners for each other. It may be smoother for fintechs to partner with smaller banks, as their less complex operations could make it easier to overhaul legacy processes and achieve seamless integrations.\n\nRegional and community banks may be especially attractive partners for fintechs that are looking to offer more banking services, but don't have the necessary license. With time, and as the alliance establishes itself, we expect that more small banks will join to improve their digital services, which will help fintechs boost their distribution and presence in the US market.", "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like.

Until now, the superfood subscription seller has been filling our freezers with ready-to-blend smoothies, ready-to-heat soups and lattes, and most recently, ready-to-heat savory harvest bowls, but now, it's adding the most important part of a meal \u2014 dessert.\n\nDubbed Holiday Cookies, these sweets are just as delicious as everything else Daily Harvest offers, and somehow, just as healthy. Really, I just wish they were bigger.\n\nThe cookies from Daily Harvest, like the other products from the trendy treat purveyor, don't come to you entirely ready-made. Instead, you'll receive small packets of frozen cookie dough, all of which are gluten-free, and made with plant-based ingredients. Be warned \u2014 if you're hoping for a Pillsbury chocolate chip cookie, this isn't it. But if you're looking for the 21st-century answer to guilt-free dessert, then consider this your promised land.\n\nDaily Harvest\n\nThe frozen dough arrives in a limited-edition gift box, and includes three boxes of 12 cookies for 36 total treats. There's Chocolate Chia, an all-chocolate dessert that is meant to evoke memories of a fudge brownie. But instead of depending upon boatloads of butter and sugar, this cookie instead leverages avocado and sunflower seed butter, along with chia seeds and \u2014 believe it or not \u2014 adaptogenic reishi mushroom in order to add a protein punch to your indulgence.\n\nOf course, as much as you'd like a wholly healthy brownie to taste the same as the brownies of your childhood, the Chocolate Chia cookie won't do quite that. While I was pleasantly surprised by the richness and decadence of the baked good, and it did taste extremely fudge-y, it's not nearly as sweet as your traditional brownie, and there's a particularly nutty taste that I've come to associate with all healthful food.\n\nThen, there's the Coconut Lemon cookie, a personal favorite of mine, which tastes an awful lot like a coconut macaroon both in terms of flavor and texture. There are also added notes of ginger and lemon for a bit more complexity, making this the most interesting cookie that Daily Harvest offers. The dough is made of coconut and cassava flour, and incorporates a healthy dose of lemon as well as flaxseed so that you're getting your daily fiber intake.\n\nFinally, there's the classic Cacao Nib, Daily Harvest's take on a chocolate chip cookie. Made of whole chickpeas, sunflower seed butter, pumpkin, cassava flour, cacao nibs, and superpower adaptogenic maca root, this may just be the fanciest chocolate chip cookie you'll ever eat. Much like the Chocolate Chia cookie, this guy tastes quite nutty thanks to sunflower seed butter, and the cacao nibs also add a great, crunchy textural component. Alas, cacao nibs won't melt in the oven or in your mouth quite the same way that a chocolate chip might, but if you're looking for a guilt-free alternative, this is certainly one of the better (and better for you) imitations that I've found.\n\nWhile all these cookies bake up easily at 375 degrees in your oven, I've found that my favorite way to enjoy them is raw, straight out of the freezer. Thanks to their plant-based ingredients, you won't have to worry about getting yourself sick by foregoing heat treatment. And honestly, it's easier to forget that you're not eating the real thing when you're just eating the dough.\n\nA word to the wise \u2014 these cookies don't spread much (if at all) when baking up, so don't expect your little cookie dough drops to become large, pancake-like monsters in the oven. Just keep an eye on them while they're baking, and don't leave them in for longer than 18 minutes.\n\nThe Holiday Cookies will only be available from November 9, 2018, through the end of the year, and may just make the perfect under-$50 gift for the health nut in your life.", "Actress and executive producer, Issa Rae from HBO's \"Insecure.\" Randy Shropshire/Getty After a brutal quarter for traditional pay TV, which saw historic subscriber losses, TV networks are looking around nervously for which distributors can pick up the slack.\n\nBut the word from AT&T isn't encouraging.\n\nIn a note distributed on Monday, analysts at UBS took a close look at what AT&T management's recent comments indicate about the future of its TV business.\n\n\"AT&T has indicated it is shifting focus from subscriber growth to profitability and is reevaluating its programming lineups to offer skinnier bundles,\" according to the UBS note.

Scott led Nelson by 0.21 percentage points on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe tight races underscored Florida's status as a perennial swing state in which elections are often decided by the thinnest of margins. Since 2000, when Florida decided the presidency by 537 votes in a contest that took more than five weeks to sort out, the state has seen many close elections but never so many dead heats in one year.\n\nAnd like 2000, the counting process is becoming contentious.\n\nDemocratic Sen.

Nelson's lawyer called that race a \"jump ball\" \u2014 though Scott's campaign urged Nelson to concede. Scott led Nelson by 0.21 percentage points on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe tight races underscored Florida's status as a perennial swing state in which elections are often decided by the thinnest of margins. Since 2000, when Florida decided the presidency by 537 votes in a contest that took more than five weeks to sort out, the state has seen many close elections but never so many dead heats in one year.\n\nAnd like 2000, the counting process is becoming contentious.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bill Nelson. AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack\n\nAs outgoing governor, Scott said at a news conference Thursday night that he was ordering the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate elections offices in the Democratic strongholds of Palm Beach and Broward counties, accusing officials of failing to certify results while continuing to seek ballots for the results they want.\n\nThe Senate candidate Scott also filed a lawsuit demanding that the Broward County supervisor of elections be ordered to turn over several records detailing the counting and collection of ballots cast.\n\nNelson's campaign released a statement saying Scott's action appeared to be politically motivated and borne out of desperation.\n\nSarah Revell, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of State, said she didn't know of any other recount in a governor or Senate race in state history. She was researching the subject Thursday.\n\nUnder Florida law, a recount is mandatory if the winning candidate's margin is less than half a percentage point when the first unofficial count is verified Saturday by Florida's secretary of state.\n\nThe Associated Press has called the governor's race for DeSantis. If Saturday's count shows DeSantis with a margin narrow enough to trigger a recount, the AP will retract its call for DeSantis. It is AP policy not to call a race that is facing a recount.\n\nThe AP has not called a winner in the Senate race.\n\nIn yet a third statewide seat \u2014 the Cabinet position of agriculture commissioner \u2014 the candidates were separated by 483 votes out of more than 8 million cast \u2014 a margin of 0.006 percentage points.\n\nGillum's campaign said it's monitoring the situation with an elections lawyer and readying for a possible state-mandated recount. He hired the attorney Barry Richard, who represented President George W. Bush in the 2000 recount.\n\n\"On Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count. Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported,\" the campaign said. \"We are committed to ensuring every single vote in Florida is counted.\"\n\nAt an event in Hialeah Gardens, DeSantis declined to discuss prospects for a recount, telling reporters he was \"very proud to be elected.\"\n\n\"It's a great honor,\" he said. \"We're working really hard on the transition. We'll let the lawyers do what they got to do. But, we're good and look forward to serving.\"\n\nFlorida was mocked for the way it handled the infamous 2000 recount, especially since there was no uniform process then on how to proceed. That has changed, with the Legislature passing a clear procedure on how a recount should be conducted.\n\n\"This is not like it was in 2000,\" Richard said. \"There's not a lot of room for strategy.\"\n\nElections officials in Broward County, where Democrats have a large advantage, were still reviewing ballots Thursday.\n\nThe Broward elections supervisor Brenda Snipes said that she didn't know how many ballots remained to be counted but that all were being processed. She also did not know how many provisional, military, and mismarked ballots needed to be counted. Her department's website said ballots cast on Election Day had been counted.\n\nMarc Elias, a lawyer hired by Nelson, said he expected the margin to narrow further.\n\n\"The results of the 2018 Senate election are unknown, and I think that you and the elections officials should treat it as such,\" Elias told reporters on a conference call. \"We believe that at the end of this process that Senator Nelson is going to be declared the winner.\"\n\nScott's campaign has said Nelson should concede the race rather than push for a recount.\n\n\"Let's be clear: When Elias says 'win,' he means 'steal,'\" the campaign said in a statement. \"It is sad and embarrassing that Bill Nelson would resort to these low tactics after the voters have clearly spoken.\"\n\nWhile the Senate and governor races drew national attention, a Florida Cabinet seat also will most likely have a statewide recount.\n\nIn the race for agriculture commissioner, the Democrat Nikki Fried had a 483-vote lead over the Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell, or a difference of 0.006 percentage points \u2014 well within range of a hand recount.\n\nFlorida counties have until noon Saturday to submit unofficial election results to the Department of State. Secretary of State Ken Detzner, who was appointed by Scott, will review the results and decide whether to order recounts.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Terry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale and Ellis Rua in Hialeah Gardens contributed to this report.", "Telemachus Orfanos, one of the 12 victims of Wednesday night's mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, had survived the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017.\n\nOrfanos, along with hundreds of others, witnessed and survived one of the most brutal, senseless acts of violence in US history as a gunman, with no identified motive, opened fire out of the window of his hotel room, killing 58 and wounding nearly 500.\n\nBut a month after the horror of the shooting that targeted concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas strip last year, survivors shook off the terror for a holiday buffet dinner.\n\n\"Last year I put together a Thanksgiving dinner/potluck just out of wanting to come together with everyone,\" Stacie Armentrout, a Route 91 survivor who has become a key organizer for the community, told Business Insider. \"I wanted us to spend the holiday together and be together.\"\n\nSince then, the group of strangers once united only by a massacre, have \"become a family,\" said Armentrout.\n\nBut on Wednesday night, the newly forged family once again suffered a tragedy.\n\nRead more:What happened at the Thousand Oaks shooting\n\nNicholas Champion, a Las Vegas survivor who was at the Borderline, told ABC News that of the 100 or more people at the bar when the shots rang out, 50 or 60 had been with him at Route 91.\n\n\"It's unbelievable today to know that some of our family has gone through this twice again,\" said Armentrout.\n\nChandler Gunn, another member of the survivor community, told the Los Angeles Times: \"There's people that live a whole lifetime without seeing this, and then there's people that have seen it twice.\"\n\nFor Armentrout and the other survivors, Thursday morning brought back the horrors of Las Vegas.\n\nArmentrout said she spent her day talking to other Route 91 survivors who knew people at the Borderline trying to track down four missing people. Of those four, Armentrout said three had been killed.\n\nWith the death of Orfanos, at least one Route 91 survivor's murder at the Borderline has been confirmed. Orfanos joins a deputy sheriff, a former marine, a law student, a local baseball umpire, and an actress among those killed.\n\nArmentrout and her family suffered panic attacks and other fallout from the trauma, but rather than lose a single day the grief and misery that's now visited her family twice, she went to work.\n\n\"You're going through the motions, but you're not functioning.

She added that when the Las Vegas shooter's name pops up in an article, she can't even bring herself to read it.\n\nWhile media scoured details of the shooter's life for clues as to a motivation, and conspiracy theorists hurled wild accusations at all sides, Armentrout says she and the other survivors ignore it for their own good.\n\nRead more: 'I already learned from Vegas.

Over a quarter (26%) of US consumers over age 12 now listen to podcasts on a monthly basis, a jump from just 12% five years ago.\n\nAnd while the growing listener base is a huge draw for advertisers, it's not the real reason they should be exploring podcast campaigns. After all, more than half of overall daily media consumption time in the US is now spent with video.

But consider for a moment that TV and radio ad spend are already at $69 billion and $18 billion respectively, and this figure suddenly feels tiny. The podcast ad market's small size implies many brands don't recognize the valuable advertising opportunity podcasts offer.\n\nWhen looking at factors beyond pure audience size, podcast listeners present several key benefits that make the medium ripe for success for advertising \u2014 and brands would be remiss to overlook them.\n\nHere's why brands should take podcast listeners seriously:\n\nThe majority of regular podcast listeners complete all or most of the podcasts they start.

Singapore Press Holdings was an early starter, embarking on a paid subscription model over 13 years ago which has evolved over significantly over time. Last year, Indonesia'sKompas Daily launched its paid website, kompas.id, which carries premium content over its free, advertising-funded cousin, kompas.com. And more Asian publishers will be following suit.\n\nAt Digital Media Asia 2018, industry leaders from all the region's major news organisations are gathering in Hong Kong on November 7-9, 2018 to explore the various evolving business models in the news world. They also celebrate the success stories of the early adopters, which have experimented with a variety of approaches such as hard, metered, freemium and hybrid paywalls, micropayments, reader donations and memberships, and tapped into new revenue streams. Speakers from publishers such as Germany'sBILD, Switzerland'sNeue Zurcher Zeitung (NZZ) and Malaysiakini share how they have grown digital subscription income, which is far less volatile than income from third-party platforms and programmatic buying. They talk about how they have determined readers' propensity to pay and persuaded audiences to pay for quality content.\n\nAccording to WAN-IFRA's 2018 World Press Trends report, traditional revenue sources continue to come under pressure globally, registering a four and eight percent fall for print circulation, and advertising respectively*. Despite this, print media continues to drive publishers' bottom line globally, while digital circulation revenue has increased by 155% in the last five years as more users pay for online content*. And there is a lot more potential for growth.\n\nPersonalising user experience to drive engagement and subscription\n\nEarly pioneers in digital subscriptions have moved into personalising the delivery of news products to drive reader engagement, and ultimately, subscriptions. At NZZ, machine-learning algorithms help personalise the user experience and its paywall, enabling the company to quintuple customer conversion in the last three years. Over at Fairfax Australia, deep customer insights and engagement metrics shaped this year's redesign of its sites such as the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in Melbourne in pursuit of its ambitious paid membership goals.\n\nCreating sustainable revenue streams\n\nAt Digital Media Asia, speakers from Reuters News Agency and Google encourage the exploration of new ground in non-traditional partnerships which extend beyond publishers' usual reader, media or advertising clients, while early movers in the media blockchain space, such as CoinDesk, Forkast.news and Smartchain Media cut through all the hype, demystify the technology and tokenomics, and explain why there is a future on the blockchain.\n\nDigital Media Asia 2018 Conference sessions\n\nTransformation and business models\n\nGo local: driving revenue with local communities\n\nNative advertising as premium ad revenue\n\nNon-traditional partnerships\n\nDigital marketing using AI\n\nNew ways of creating premium content\n\nDigital media consumption trends in Asia\n\nDigital subscription\n\nEngagement and personalisation\n\nInstagram stories school\n\nVideo for social media\n\nData for business intelligence\n\nBlockchain for the media industry\n\nProduct development and innovation\n\n#DMAHK18 #blockchain #paidcontent #monetisation #AI #nativeadvertising #video #social #dataintelligence #premiumcontent #digitalmarketing #markettrends\n\n* Source: WAN-IFRA World Press trends 2018 - Print advertising revenues globally fell by 8.3% in 2017 while digital advertising revenues rose by 5.38%.

But at the meeting, Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, suggested that their concerns weren't shared universally within the company, according to the BuzzFeed News report. And Amazon's management is comfortable with continuing to offer the software to government agencies, he said.\n\n\"With over 500,000 employees like we have at Amazon, I think we're going to have people who have opinions that are very wide-ranging, which is great,\" Jassy said, according to a transcript provided to BuzzFeed News. \"But we feel really great and really strongly about the value that Amazon Rekognition is providing our customers of all sizes and all types of industries in law enforcement and out of law enforcement.\"\n\nIn the letter, which has now been signed by some 450 Amazon workers, the employees voiced concern that the facial-recognition software would be used as a surveillance tool against citizens and would be used to harm marginalized groups and people. They were especially concerned that by aiding the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Amazon was complicit in such policies as the widely decried practice \u2014 since stopped \u2014 of separating undocumented immigrant children from their parents or other caregivers.\n\nRead more: Amazon employees are reportedly gearing up to confront CEO Jeff Bezos at an all-staff meeting this week about selling facial recognition software to law enforcement\n\nAny technology can be used for evil, Jassy said\n\nAmazon is among several big tech companies facing pushback from employees about the way their products are used. Employees at Google forced the company to forswear doing business with the military if its technology was going to be used in weapons.\n\nBut Amazon's Jassy pushed back on such ethical concerns. Any technology can be used for \"evil\" ends, he told employees, according to the report. Amazon has tried to prevent that from happening by requiring users of its Rekognition software and other AWS features to agree to its terms of service, which mandate that they're used \"responsibly,\" he said.\n\nIf customers violate \"folks' constitutional rights,\" they won't be able to use the service, Jassy said, according to the report. And he said it was up to the government to set the guidelines for appropriate use of such technology.\n\nIn addition to calling on Amazon to cease providing its facial-recognition software to ICE and law enforcement agencies, the letter also demanded that Amazon cancel Palantir's access to AWS' services. Palantir, the secretive data mining startup, has been a technology provider to ICE, according to published reports.\n\nJassy apparently didn't address that demand.\n\nNow read:", "An elite group of \"patriotic\" students in China have been selected to begin training for new artificial intelligence weapons development program.\n\n31 kids \u2014 all under 18 \u2014 have been recruited to participate in the \"Experimental Program for Intelligent Weapons Systems\" at the Beijing Institute of Technology, South China Morning Post reported Thursday, citing an announcement from the Beijing Institute of Technology. The program selected 27 boys and four girls from more than 5,000 applicants, the school's website said, according to the Post.\n\n\"These kids are all exceptionally bright, but being bright is not enough,\" a BIT professor who asked not to be identified told the Post.\n\n\"We are looking for other qualities such as creative thinking, willingness to fight, a persistence when facing challenges,\" he said. \"A passion for developing new weapons is a must \u2026 and they must also be patriots.\"\n\nAccording to the program's brochure, each student will be mentored by two weapons scientists with both academic and defense backgrounds. The kids will later be tasked with choosing a specialization within the weapons sector and will be assigned to the relevant defense laboratory to hone their skills under the guidance of experts.\n\nThe institute expects students will go on to complete doctorate degrees and become leaders in the field of AI weapons technology, the Post said.\n\nChina has been outspoken about its interest in developing AI technology\n\nA man puts dishes on robots for delivery at a restaurant in Hefei, Anhui province, December 26, 2014. Reuters\n\nChina has touted its AI development across sectors, including a trillion-dollar autonomous-driving revolution and a massive expansion of its facial-recognition software.\n\nIn his keynote speech to the ruling Communist Party last year, President Xi Jinping called for the embedding of artificial intelligence technologies into the economy to create growth and expand its capabilities across industries.\n\nRead more: China is preparing for a trillion-dollar autonomous-driving revolution\n\nIn July, China released its own AI development plan, which proposed building up its domestic AI industry to $150 billion over the next few years to establish the country as an \"innovation center for AI\" by 2030.\n\nAnd while China has largely kept the development of its AI-weapons technology opaque, Elsa B. Kania an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security, predicts that China's army will \"likely leverage AI to enhance its future capabilities, including in intelligent and autonomous unmanned systems.\"\n\nChina is reportedly working on a fleet of drone submarines in order to give China's navy an advantage at sea. And in April, the Chinese air force released details about an upcoming drill using fully autonomous swarms of drones.\n\nBut experts have repeatedly warned about the dangers of AI\n\nAn MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft is parked in an aircraft shelter at Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs, Nevada. Isaac Brekken/Getty Images\n\nExperts have repeatedly warned about the dangers AI, arguing that advanced systems which can make thousands of complex decisions every second could have \"dual-use\" to help or harm, depending on its design.\n\nIn February, AI experts across industries outlined in a 100-page report the dangers of AI technology and how the technology could be weaponized for malicious use. Aside from using AI technology for attacks in the digital realm, the technology could be used in the physical realm to turn technology, like drones, into weapons and attack targets at the push of a button or the click of a mouse.\n\nIn April, China submitted its proposal to the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems announcing its desire to create a new protocol for restricting the use of AI weapons. In its proposal, China highlighted the dangers of AI weaponry but also stressed the need to continue developing AI technology.", "On Thursday, the internet caught wind of something truly special \u2014 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg joined a Facebook Group called \"Harvard Memes for Elitist 1% Tweens.\"\n\nIt's a private Facebook group, but there's no need to be an alumnus of the Ivy League school to be accepted. Memes just need to be Harvard-specific and \"apply to any group of wealthy, pretentious pseudo-intellectuals.\"\n\nNo one is certain why Zuckerberg, who launched Facebook in his Harvard dorm room and then dropped out to focus full-time on the social network, joined the meme group. Perhaps he wanted to blow off some post-midterm elections steam. Maybe it was an attempt to make up for the last time he publicly tested one of his own products (see Facebook Live debacle here). Perhaps he, like Elon Musk, just really loves memes.\n\nAt any rate, here's a look at how Zuckerberg's introduction to the group has gone thus far, as captured in screenshots by Business Insider's own Kif Leswing.\n\nTaylor Lorenz/Twitter\n\nZuckerberg came out with a bang for his first comment in the group, saying: \"This group is wonderful.\"\n\nTaylorLorenz/Twitter\n\nThen, when prompted to try and get Bill Gates to join the group to form a \"dropout squad,\" Zuckerberg accepted.\n\nTaylor Lorenz/Twitter\n\nOne group member posted a meme of Zuckerberg and was worried he'd be barred from Facebook altogether.\n\nFacebook/screenshot\n\nThe CEO assured him that no such thing would happen to which other group members applauded, calling it an \"iconic moment.\"\n\nTaylor Lorenz/Twitter\n\nAnother member responded to the situation how any good member of a private-meme society would respond \u2014 with a meme.\n\nFacebook/screenshot\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nAlso, it's still to be determined whether Bill Gates will accept Zuckerberg's invitation to the group.", "A Lion Air passenger plane reportedly hit a lamp post, fewer than two weeks after Indonesia's discount carrier crashed a jet off the coast of Java, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nLate on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg, a Boeing 737-900ER operated by Lion Air subsidiary, PT Lion Mentari Airlines hit a pole causing significant structural damage to the wing.\n\nThe plane was taxiing at Bengkulu Fatmawati Soekarno airport in the island of Sumatra. The accident left a significant hole in the left wing. Indonesia's Transportation Ministry has said it will investigate the incident which happened around 6:30 p.m. local time.\n\nThe loss of Lion Air flight JT610 on October 28, which fell into the ocean just 13 minutes after leaving Jakarta, was Indonesia's worst air disaster in two decades. It was also Lion Air's first accident since 2004.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday also issued an emergency airworthiness directive on about 250 Boeing 737 Max aircraft after Boeing issued a bulletin to customers of the 737 Max in the aftermath of the Lion Air tragedy.", "Dropbox staved off its doubters on Thursday \u2014 at least for the time being.\n\nThe file-hosting company reported third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's modest expectations and offered a better-than-expected forecast for the holiday period. It also reported that its average revenue per user rose a bit from last year, a possible indication that its effort to attract business customers might be paying off.\n\n\"We delivered another quarter of strong execution,\" Dropbox CEO Drew Houston said in a statement. He continued: \"We're shipping product features and updates our users love, based on a deep understanding of our customers and the tools they need to do their best work.\"\n\nInvestors cheered the results. In recent after-hours trading following its report, the company's stock was up $2.01, or 8%, to $26.75.\n\nWall Street remains skeptical of Dropbox\n\nBut many investors and analysts remain skeptical about Dropbox's longer-term prospects. Analysts such as Nomura's Christopher Eberle are concerned about its ability to attract a significant number of enterprise clients, especially since the company started off as a consumer-oriented service. Such concerns, which are shared widely on Wall Street, have weighed down the company's stock, he said. Dropbox's shares are down 39% since peaking in June.\n\n\"It's very fundamentally difficult to transition to focusing on enterprise,\" Eberle told Business Insider. \"There's security reasons why that's not possible.\"\n\nHere's what Dropbox reported:\n\nQ3 Revenue: $360.3 million, which was up 26 percent from the same period last year. Analysts were expecting $352.57 million.\n\n$360.3 million, which was up 26 percent from the same period last year. Analysts were expecting $352.57 million.

Analysts had predicted $363.7 million.\n\nRead more: Dropbox CEO Drew Houston heard that going public was 'finding a way to live in hell without dying' \u2014 but after the IPO, he's seeing the light\n\nDropbox exceeded the Street's revenue expectations thanks to gains in new paying users, it said. By the end of the third quarter, it had 12.3 million paid users, up from 10.4 million a year earlier.\n\nThe company was also able to get more money out of each user. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) rose to $118.60 from $112.05 in the same period a year ago.\n\nPer-user revenue is growing slower than investors hoped\n\nDropbox went public in March and saw its stock price surge 36 percent in its trading debut. Investors were excited about the company's potential in the enterprise space, Eberle said. They thought its success in the area would translate into big gains in ARPU, he said. Some thought it could quickly rise as high as $125, but the company has since struggled to meet those expectations.\n\nThe company's growth in paid users has also been slower than investors hoped, Eberle said. One other worry: the company stopped disclosing its growth in business users after the first quarter, he said.\n\n\"They really haven't talked about it since then,\" he said. \"That's an area of our concern ... The enterprise side of this story has disappeared.\"\n\nDropbox's revenue forecast for next quarter is relatively conservative and should be achievable, Eberle said. But if it wants to start growing rapidly \u2014 and see its stock price go up accordingly \u2014 it needs to find a way to catch on among enterprise customers, he said. And that's going to remain a challenge, he said.\n\nDropbox is adding features to appeal to enterprise customers\n\nTo be sure, Dropbox has been adding features that are targeted at just such an audience. This past quarter, it invested in its machine intelligence capabilities. It upgraded its search engine so users can personalize their searches and find files more efficiently. It also introduced an image search feature, allowing users to search for text within images.\n\nIn addition, the company announced a feature to help business users manage their workflows and another to help with project management. It also added integrations for Zoom and Salesforce to its software.\n\nOn Thursday, it announced a partnership with Google Cloud Identity and other companies to give Dropbox Business customers more advanced security features.\n\nWant to hear from Dropbox CEO Drew Houston? Join us in December at IGNITION 2018 in NYC.", "In response to a recent employee walkout protesting how Google has handled sexual-harassment cases, CEO Sundar Pichai released new policies for employees on Thursday.\n\nSome of the new policies were items that the protesting workers had called for, like ending forced arbitration for employees who want to sue over harassment claims. But Google also included a new measure in its new list of policies that may catch some employees by surprise: a crackdown on alcohol at work and after-hours at all work-related functions.\n\nThe policy says that leaders who do not take steps to limit drinking at events will be on the hook, citing a statistic that says in 20% of Google's reported sexual-harassment cases, alcohol played a role.\n\nRead more: One of Google's new sexual harassment policies could be the key to changing all of Silicon Valley's bro culture\n\nThe policy also warns that Google \"will impose more onerous actions if problems persist.\" We take that to mean that Pichai may attempt to ban alcohol altogether.\n\nSilicon Valley has a drinking culture, and Google is at least partially the reason why. In its early years, Google was a wild, childlike place to work, filled with people in their 20s. It was deliberately trying not to be your father's and mother's stuffy kind of corporation. The company would throw wild parties with lots of alcohol and other substances, early employees have described.\n\nBut the seeds of that corporate culture have grown into a tree. And it may be time to prune it.\n\nHere is the alcohol policy Google disclosed on Thursday:\n\nExcessive alcohol: Harassment is never acceptable and alcohol is never an excuse. But one of the most common factors among the harassment complaints made today at Google is that the perpetrator had been drinking (~20% of cases). Our policy is clear: Excessive consumption of alcohol is not permitted when you are at work, performing Google business, or attending a Google-related event, whether onsite or offsite.\n\nGoing forward, all leaders at the company \u2014 Directors, VPs and SVPs \u2014 will be expected to create teams, events, offsites and environments in which excessive alcohol consumption is strongly discouraged. For example, many teams have already put two-drink limits in place for events. Others use drink ticket systems. The onus will be on leaders to take appropriate steps to restrict any excessive consumption among their teams, and we will impose more onerous actions if problems persist."]
