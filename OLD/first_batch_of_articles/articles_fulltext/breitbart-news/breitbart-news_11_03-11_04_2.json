Both of those bombs, investigators say, were meant for a terrorist attack in Mexico that Ahmad was planning.\n\nBetween March and April 2017, Ahmad allegedly taught an undercover FBI agent how to make and detonate a bomb, devices that Ahmad said \u201cwere easy to make,\u201d according to court filings.

As the late Larry Munson, who called University of Georgia football games on the radio for decades, might have said, \u201cPresident Donald Trump stepped on the record books with a hobnail boot and broke their bindings.\u201d\n\nSeveral thousand lined up hours early to see Trump make his closing argument for Georgia Republican gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp, who faces Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams on Tuesday.\n\nThe president emphasized the importance of Tuesday\u2019s election right away after taking the stage and boasted about the \u201celectricity in the air\u201d as it approaches.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most important elections of our lifetime,\u201d Trump said during his introduction. \u201cThis is a very important election. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as important as 2016, but it\u2019s right up there. It\u2019s right up there. It really is. It\u2019s become so incredible, and there is electricity in the air like I haven\u2019t seen since the 2016 big victory that we all had together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncredible electricity,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd in fact, speaking of that, could I ask \u2014 look at this. It\u2019s like the Academy Awards. Look at how many cameras. Could I ask you to turn around and shoot? They don\u2019t have to do this with other celebrities when they come here that don\u2019t have very big crowds. Look at the people back there. Shoot it. You\u2019ve got to shoot it.\u201d\n\nTrump listed the progress Georgia had made since his inauguration and urged attendees to elect Kemp to ensure it continues.\n\n\u201cJobless claims in Georgia just fell to their lowest level in 45 years,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMore Georgia workers are employed today than at any time or any point in American history. Think of that. Do you want to see that end quickly? Do you want to see Georgia prosperity end quickly? Vote for the Democrat. She\u2019ll end it quickly. She will end it quickly, and she\u2019ll double up your taxes, and a lot of bad things will happen. We passed a massive tax cut for Georgia families, and we will soon follow it up with another 10 percent tax cut for the middle-class. We\u2019re working on that now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in Georgia, the great news just keeps rolling in,\u201d he continued. \u201cJobs are going up. Crime is going down. Wages are rising, the first time in many years. You saw that in the report on Friday. Poverty is plummeting, and confidence is at an all-time high. Other than that, we\u2019re not doing very well. Under Republican leadership, Georgia is safer, Georgia is stronger, and Georgia is winning like never before. And I\u2019ll tell you what, I know Brian. He will take it to new heights, heights that you wouldn\u2019t even believe. I know him. This guy doesn\u2019t stop, which is what you want. He\u2019s an incredible manager. He\u2019s been successful all the way up and down the line. This man will bring it to heights that you wouldn\u2019t believe, even today with those great numbers.\u201d\n\nThe president also reminded rallygoers about now-Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation process in the U.S. Senate, which some political watchers say gave Republicans a late-campaign surge in the polls. He also mentioned that one of Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers had backtracked on her story.\n\n\u201cTo protect your rights and freedoms, we overcame the Democrat smear campaign and confirmed the newest member of the United States Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d he said. \u201cBoy, did he get treated badly. The Democrats treated him so badly, so unfair. And did you see what happened on Friday? You know what I\u2019m talking about, right? They knew \u2014 you knew that before. You knew that these three women, they knew that before. They knew that a long time ago. So, a woman, who accused then Judge Kavanaugh of horrible, horrible crimes admitted that actually she never met Judge Kavanaugh or Brett Kavanaugh or Kavanaugh period. Never met him, never saw him and the act never happened, and it was a lie. It was a total lie. She made up the story, and she was forced to admit it.\u201d\n\nTrump also touched on immigration, one of the key planks in his 2016 campaign election platform and warned if Democrats were elected, they would seek to \u201ctotally erase America\u2019s borders,\u201d among other things.\n\n\u201cThey want to take away and destroy your health care because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, impose socialism and totally erase America\u2019s borders,\u201d he said. \u201cHow about that caravan? Do you want to let that caravan just pour in? I don\u2019t think so. So we started the wall. $1.6 billion. Another $1.6 billion just approved. We\u2019re building it in pieces and chunks, but I want to build it all at one time. In the meantime, you saw last week I called up the United States military. We\u2019re not playing games, folks. There\u2019s no games because you look at what\u2019s marching up, that\u2019s an invasion. That\u2019s not \u2014 that\u2019s an invasion.\u201d\n\nAfter the Macon event, Trump headed to Chattanooga, TN for a Sunday evening event, and wraps up his campaign rally tour with stops in Cleveland, Fort Wayne, IN and Cape Girardeau, MO on Monday.\n\nIn the Georgia race, polling has been mixed. However, the Real Clear Politics polling average has Kemp with a slight advantage over Abrams.

The vast majority of jobs lost from free trade with China has been in the U.S. manufacturing sector, making up 74.4 percent of all jobs lost and amounting to 2.5 million U.S. manufacturing jobs lost. This total of jobs lost also includes the 1.3 million American jobs lost since 2008.\n\nThe EPI researchers note that the U.S.-China trade deficit has eliminated American jobs in all 50 states and in every single congressional district across the country.\n\nStates that saw the largest amount of job loss from free trade with China include California, where more than 560,000 U.S. jobs have been lost, Texas, where 314,000 U.S. jobs were eliminated, and New York which saw 183,500 U.S. jobs lost in the state.\n\nStates like Oregon, New Hampshire, Minnesota, North Carolina, Vermont, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island were among the 10 \u201chardest-hit states, when looking at job loss as a share of total state employment,\u201d the EPI researchers note.\n\nBillionaire venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has criticized free trade and globalization as \u201ctotally at odds\u201d with reality.\n\n\u201cWe export a $100 billion a year to China, import $475 billion, and then the other side of that is the $375 billion gets sent from China to invest in the U.S., so you have this really weird dynamic where the money is sort of flowing uphill from a fast-growing China into a slower growing U.S. and an even slower growing Japan and Eastern Europe,\u201d Thiel has said, as Breitbart News reported. \u201cThat fact tells you that whatever the free trade theory says, what is actually happening is totally at odds with that.\u201d\n\nThiel said free trade is \u201cnot working remotely the way\u201d it has been \u201cadvertised\u201d to the American public.\n\nSince the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in the 1990s, at least one million net U.S. jobs have been lost because of the free trade deal.

In 2017, the foreign-born population boomed to 13.7 percent, encompassing 44.5 million immigrants. The last great wave of immigration to the U.S. was followed by a near immigration moratorium.\n\nRecent research by NumbersUSA reveals that should current legal immigration levels continue \u2014 where the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals every year \u2014 the country\u2019s population will double what it was in 1970.\n\nThe NumbersUSA research notes that the quality of life in America, with an additional 75 million residents living in the U.S. will be greatly reduced. Such a drastic population increase is likely to increase highway traffic, increase housing prices, increase the density of communities, and destroy large regions of farmland that will need to be inhabited to house the booming population.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea. The total anchor baby population exceeds the annual roughly 4 million American babies born every year. Many leading conservative scholars argue the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide mandatory birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or noncitizens, as these children are not subject to U.S. jurisdiction as that language was understood when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.", "Bill and Hillary Clinton are cashing in on the speaking circuit to the point where it is costing people an arm and a leg to attend their events.\n\nResale tickets to the Clintons\u2019 upcoming speaking tour \u201cAn Evening with the Clintons\u201d are going for nearly $2,000 on StubHub as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nOrchestra seats for the tour at New York\u2019s Beacon Theater on April 11, 2019, are going for $1,712.37, while the cheapest seats for that tour date have a listing price of $136, according to the ticket resale website.\n\nFace value tickets for the event do not run cheap either.

He\u2019s promoting violence. I\u2019m accustomed to being threatened. We have had at least one individual indicted who threatened to kill me. I have many threats to kill me from different places in this country. So I\u2019m accustomed to being threatened, and while I am not foolish, I\u2019m wise enough to understand that I need to have some security, particularly in various circumstances. I\u2019m not afraid. I\u2019m not intimidated, and he cannot stop me. I\u2019m going to continue to talk about how he has defined himself as this divisive and dangerous man that\u2019s running this country.

He does not have good values and does not care about anybody but himself. I\u2019m comfortable with the fact that he has the target on my back and that I\u2019m threatened.

And they have all come under relentless attack by progressive elites.\n\nIn the two years between the presidential election in 2016 and the upcoming midterm elections, we\u2019ve witnessed an unprecedented attack on democracy. This war has not been waged, as the elites allege, by foreign actors \u2014 but by themselves. And it\u2019s not just targeted at elections \u2014 it\u2019s targeted at every tool we use to speak, organize, and signal our preferences.\n\nTake Twitter\u2019s recent announcement that it plans to remove its \u201clike\u201d button. \u201cLikes\u201d are a primary way Twitter users engage with each other \u2014 the fancy term for interacting. It\u2019s how users tell friends they read their tweet and appreciate it, or throw themselves in with an influencer\u2019s hot take. Social media companies live or die by engagement levels \u2014 that a platform would willingly cut engagement is drastic, to say the least.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey has also said that he wants to reexamine the prominence of follower counts, suggesting to CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter that incentivizing people to grow their following may not be the \u201cright incentive.\u201d In both cases, Twitter is seeking to diminish metrics often used to signal popularity. The idea that ordinary people might actually grow their own followings or signal their approval has become a problem for Twitter.\n\nFacebook has undergone a similar journey in the past two years. The company previously used its newsfeed ranking algorithms to show users content that was similar to content that they previously approved of by hitting the \u201clike\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d button. Everything was structured around the user and his preferences. But starting in January, Facebook began to roll back this system, deciding on behalf of its users that they needed to see more posts from friends and family, and fewer from pages that they liked or followed.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like something happened in 2016 that made the company conclude that there was a problem with its users\u2019 preferences!\n\nThis trend of elites seeking to hide, thwart, or undermine the choices of ordinary people, can be seen everywhere. It\u2019s the top national issue in Britain, where every elite from the conservative Prime Minister downwards is trying to co-opt, water down, or thwart the outcome of the Brexit referendum. A simple question \u2014 a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on whether the U.K. should leave the E.U. or not \u2014has been warped by elites into a debate between \u201chard Brexit,\u201d \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d (elites are terrified of this) and \u201csoft Brexit\u201d (so watered down that the former Brexit secretary says it would almost be the same as staying in the E.U.)\n\nAmerican voters are also familiar with elites\u2019 attempts to undermine their decisions at the ballot box, witnessing a Deep State of shadowy unelected bureaucrats work tirelessly to undermine the President\u2019s agenda through a campaign of leaks and policy sabotage. The Deep State is so brazen that its members now boast of their existence in New York Time op-eds.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just in high politics where we see this trend. Look at the constant controversies over the movie reviewing site Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates reviews from critics to give films a \u201ccritics rating\u201d and from regular moviegoers to give it an \u201caudience\u201d rating. As Hollywood tried to shove progressive narratives down the throat of increasingly unwilling moviegoers, the gap between critics scores and audience scores on the website has widened. Movies like the Ghostbusters reboot (2016), Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) and the new Star Trek series, all of which were widely criticized for overdosing on progressivism, were subject to plummeting audience scores. The Last Jedi, for example, has a withering 45 percent rating from the public \u2014 the lowest for a Star Wars film.\n\nIn response, progressive film critics quickly adopted the narrative that the dismal audience scores were due to \u201ctrolls\u201d from the \u201calt-right.\u201d Other claimed the review scores were \u201crigged,\u201d or questioned the entire purpose of giving the general public a tool to express its opinion. Eventually, with the release of Black Panther (2018), the progressives got their way, as Rotten Tomatoes promised to intervene against \u201chate speech\u201d surrounding the movie.\n\nThe film critics did several things that will sound familiar to supporters of Trump, supporters of Brexit, and supporters of any cause opposed to elites. First, they conflated all their opponents with a small minority of racist bigots. Then they accused the process of being \u201crigged.\u201d Finally, they forced the owners of a platform \u2013 who already promoted elite, overeducated critics\u2019 reviews over the audience scores \u2013 to further clamp down on their users\u2019 speech. Sound familiar?\n\nWrit large or writ small, we see this pattern everywhere.\n\nIt didn\u2019t even begin with Donald Trump or Brexit. In the early 2010s, progressive journalists were already whining about the comments sections underneath their articles , which allowed ordinary people to actually criticize them in real-time. They got their way of course, and the comments sections slowly began to disappear . In a foreshadowing of a modern-day progressive narrative about free speech online, Ars Technica warned that comments sections could \u201cmake you mistrust real experts.\u201d\n\nThe progressives decided long ago that it\u2019s dangerous to allow ordinary people to freely signal their preferences online. Whether it\u2019s review scores, comments sections, or an entire platform like Gab, every tool of popular expression has come under siege as elites fight back against the masses.\n\nIf you want to donate money to a cause that the elites don\u2019t like, they won\u2019t let you.\n\nIf you want to follow a journalist, commentator, or political figure on social media that the elites don\u2019t like, they won\u2019t let you .\n\nIf you want to join a social media platform that won\u2019t ban you for lawful speech, the elites won\u2019t let you.\n\nAnd if you want to criticize a video game that the elites like, they\u2019ll call you a bigot and make it harder for you to do so.\n\nIf you want to support a comic book creator that the elites don\u2019t like, they\u2019ll call you a bigot and make it harder for you to do so.\n\nIf you voted for Brexit, you\u2019re a bigot , the vote was rigged and illegitimate , and tech companies should intervene to stop populism from getting worse.\n\nIf you voted for Trump, you\u2019re a bigot , the vote was rigged and illegitimate , and tech companies should intervene to stop populism getting worse.\n\nSupport Matteo Salvini in Italy? You\u2019re a bigot . The tech companies will intervene.\n\nLe Pen in France? Bigot . The tech companies will intervene.\n\nThese are the common features of the populist era, where the people have turned against elites and where elites have turned against the people. Everywhere we look, ordinary people are being demonized. Those who take their side are blacklisted. Elites denounce elections, referendums, and even movie reviews as rigged systems, while they ceaselessly work to actually rig the system by asking Silicon Valley elites to intervene on their behalf.\n\nThe big tech crackdowns are often shrouded in neutral language. They aren\u2019t censoring political viewpoints, just \u201charassment,\u201d \u201ctrolling,\u201d or \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nBut the lie is exposed in their double standards: Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn is denied advertising on Twitter and Google on the grounds that her material is \u201cinflammatory\u201d or \u201cshocking\u201d , while Republican House candidate Elizabeth Heng faced a similar temporary block on her ads by Twitter and Facebook .

Kadar primarily targeted community centers, schools, shopping malls, police, stations, airlines, and airports, located all around the globe. Many of his targets had Jewish affiliations. During his arrest, Kadar earned himself an additional charge when he tried to grab a gun from a policewoman\u2019s holster.\n\nKadar\u2019s parents have blamed their son\u2019s autism and mental illness for his crimes. \u201cI did it out of boredom.

A team of psychiatrists found that Kadar was on the autism spectrum and that he additionally suffered from paranoid delusions. As a result, Kadar may not be able to understand the consequences of his actions.\n\nIn total, Kadar earned $240,000 in Bitcoin for making the threats. CNN reported in August that Kadar used the deep web, a portion of the internet that is not indexed by search engines, to solicit potential \u201cclients.\u201d If he is to be convicted in the United States, Kadar would face up to 20 years in prison for each hate crime and a maximum of 10 years for each bomb threat.\n\nIt is unclear at the moment if Kadar will be extradited to the United States. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the fact that this whole trial is affected by the American pressure,\u201d defense attorney Meir Ziv said in a statement. \u201cThey are expecting a conviction and the maximum sentence or an extradition to the U.S. The fact that he was tried in Israel prevented the extradition to the U.S.\u201d", "MACON, Georgia \u2014 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams may be a media darling, but Georgia still appears to be Trump country based on the size of early crowds for a rally President Donald Trump is hosting on behalf of Abrams\u2019 opponent Brian Kemp.\n\nA rally of this magnitude for a midterm election is unprecedented in Republican-leaning Georgia.

The agents found the migrants in two separate incidents.\n\nRio Grande City Station Border Patrol agents received a call from the Roma, Texas, Police Department requesting assistance. The local police received a tip about a house being used to warehouse a group of migrants who had recently crossed the border illegally from Mexico, according to information provided to Breitbart News by Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials.\n\nThe agents responded to the area and met with the local police officers before moving on to the suspected human stash house. Roma police officers approached the residence and carried out a \u201cwelfare check\u201d to see if there was any trouble in the home. After making entry into the home, officers and agents found 49 suspected illegal aliens packed into the small house.\n\nBorder Patrol agents conducted an immigration interview and determined the 49 migrants entered the U.S. illegally from the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua, officials stated. Agents said the group consisted of men, women, and children.\n\nThe agents place all of the migrants in custody and transported them to the Rio Grande City Station for processing.\n\nCartel-connected smugglers use stash houses to stage large quantities of what they regard as human cargo after they illegal cross them into the U.S. from Mexico, officials previously told Breitbart News. The smugglers then schedule a time to move the migrants north to attempt to circumvent inland Border Patrol immigration checkpoints.\n\nFrequently the smugglers will violently attack the migrants and hold them for ransom in order to extract additional smuggling fees before moving north. Men are frequently beaten and robbed, officials stated, while females are often locked into separate rooms where they can be abused or raped by the smugglers as a method of intimidation.\n\nA few hours after the initial find, Border Patrol agents teamed up with Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and police officers from the city of Hidalgo, Texas, to shut down another human smuggling operation. This time, smugglers chose a motel room to stash 10 illegal aliens.\n\nThe law enforcement team entered the motel room and found 10 migrants stashed inside. The Border Patrol agents conducted an immigration interview and learned the migrants were all from the country of China.\n\nTwo days earlier, Laredo Sector Border Patrol agents raided another motel being used as a warehouse for human cargo. The agents assigned to teh Joint Taskforce West, South Texas Corridor Joint Targeting Team teamed up with DPS troopers and officers from the Laredo Police Department to carry out the raid.\n\nThe agents found 10 illegal aliens from a wide variety of countries stashed inside the small room, Laredo Sector officials said in a written statement. Agents said the group was composed of three Mexican nationals, one Salvadoran, two Hondurans, two Brazilians, and two from Nicaragua.\n\nAll of the migrants will be processed according to their respective sector\u2019s policies.", "San Francisco Mayor London Breed delivered a surprising veto on Friday against the Board of Supervisors\u2019 unanimous vote on Tuesday for a resolution supporting the state\u2019s controversial new Bay-Delta plan.\n\nThe plan would require rivers in the San Joaquin Valley to maintain an average of 40% of \u201cunimpeded flow\u201d during the spring months. That would take water from farmers \u2014 and also from San Francisco, which relies on the watershed.\n\nSome 85% of the water used by San Francisco and its suburbs comes from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir on the Tuolumne River, which is the waterway most likely to be affected by the Bay-Delta plan. San Francisco\u2019s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) opposes the plan, as do farming interests and communities in the Central Valley. But environmentalists and fishing interests support the plan, which they hope will revive native fish populations.\n\nThe State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) will hold a final vote on the plan on Wednesday, November 7 \u2014 conveniently, one day after the midterm elections. Several Central Valley politicians of both parties \u2014 especially Republicans, and notably Rep. Jeff Denham (R-CA) of the 10th congressional district \u2014 have vigorously opposed the Bay-Delta plan, calling it a \u201cwater grab.\u201d\n\nDenham has attacked his Democratic opponent, Josh Harder, for failing to show up at an August rally against the Bay-Delta plan (though Harder later said that he opposes the plan).\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors had opposed the plan in an effort to send a message of protest to President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Breed had more practical concerns: \u201cWe all want the same outcome for the Bay-Delta \u2014 a healthy ecosystem that both supports fish and wildlife and provides reliable water delivery,\u201d she said in a statement quoted by the San Francisco Chronicle. But \u201cit is deeply irresponsible for San Francisco to take a position that would jeopardize our water supply.\u201d\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Viewers, he has finally realised, find it a turn off.\n\nAttenborough, 92, told the Observer (sister newspaper of the Guardian):\n\n\u201cWe do have a problem. Every time the bell rings, every time that image [of a threatened animal] comes up, do you say \u2018remember, they are in danger\u2019? How often do you say this without becoming a real turn-off? It would be irresponsible to ignore it, but equally I believe we have a responsibility to make programmes that look at all the rest of the aspects and not just this one.\u201d\n\nThis will come as a relief to the many viewers who respect Attenborough as the pre-eminent TV naturalist but are bothered by the relentless green propaganda.\n\nSometimes he raises important issues, such as the pollution of the oceans with plastics. Too often, though, his points are tendentious and unscientific: a regurgitation of fashionable green pieties which are unsupported by real world data.\n\nOne of the most egregious examples was his promotion in his last series Blue Planet II of the thoroughly discredited \u2018ocean acidification\u2019 theory.\n\nAttenborough claimed: \u201cIf the temperature rises up by two degrees and the acidity by a measurable amount, lots of species of coral will die out. Quite what happens then is anybody\u2019s guess. But it won\u2019t be good.\u201d\n\nA lot of huckster activists on the climate alarmism gravy train have built tenuous careers promoting this nonsense. But no serious scientist believes it, for ocean acidification is just another environmentalist scare narrative.\n\nAs Matt Ridley noted:\n\nThe most dishonest sequence in the series was when Attenborough watched shells dissolving in a tank of acid, to a soundtrack of fizzing noises, and was told by Professor Chris Langdon that although this was \u201cmore dramatic than what\u2019s happening in the oceans\u201d, nonetheless \u201cthe shells and the reefs are really truly dissolving\u201d. This is highly misleading in several different ways. Was it carbonic acid, or another acid? The reduction in alkalinity will get nowhere near neutral, let alone actual acidity, even by the end of the 22nd century, so \u201cdissolving\u201d is false, let alone happening now. The changes in ocean pH expected even by the end of this century are minuscule compared with what was shown in that tank, and by comparison with the daily and seasonal changes that an average reef experiences. (Coral bleaching, a different issue, is more serious, but more temporary.) A 2010 analysis of 372 studies of 44 different marine species found that the world\u2019s marine fauna is \u201cmore resistant to ocean acidification than suggested by pessimistic predictions\u201d and that it \u201cmay not be the widespread problem conjured into the 21st century\u201d.\n\nAttenborough also got it completely wrong about walruses, which he made out to be much more endangered than they are.\n\nAs Paul Homewood testily pointed out:\n\nApparently tonight\u2019s episode concerns itself with walruses, who (you guessed) are all \u201cgoing to die\u201d because of \u201cmelting Arctic ice\u201d. Below is the part of the programme\u2019s introduction: Ocean currents move heat around our planet and maintain a climate favourable for life. But our ocean system, in relative equilibrium for millennia, is changing at a worrying rate. Deep in the polar north, we meet walrus mothers and their newborn calves, searching for an ice floe to rest on. But with rising temperatures, summer sea ice is retreating \u2013 their battles to survive are becoming ever harder. As we begin to understand the true complexity of the lives of our ocean creatures, so do we recognise the fragility of their home. It\u2019s a pity the doddering old idiot, David Attenborough, could not be bothered to check the facts with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who issued this press release earlier this month (my bold): The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that the Pacific walrus does not require protection as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The finding follows a comprehensive review and analysis of the best available scientific information concerning the species, as well as local and traditional ecological knowledge of Alaska Native peoples.\n\nYes, perhaps it is a bit rude to call the doyen of wildlife documentary makers a \u201cdoddering old idiot\u201d. Or, indeed, as others have been wont to describe him, a \u201cwhispery-voiced, gorilla-hugging Malthusian.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, it is surely a dangerous business when such a well-loved figure with such global prestige allows himself \u2013 whether wittingly or otherwise \u2013 to become the pawn of green propagandists.\n\nFrom overfishing to depletion of the water tables, from the tremendous ecological damage being done by wind turbines to destruction of rainforest to create \u2018biofuels\u2019, there are more than enough genuine environmental problems that need addressing.\n\nBut when Attenborough strays outside his zone of expertise and simply regurgitates untrue scare stories dreamed up by green activists, both his credibility and his viewers\u2019 patience are likely to be sorely tested.\n\nIt has taken him rather a long time to appreciate this point. Still, better late than never.", "Sen.

Rather, they almost always acquire them at retail, via background checks, or they steal them.\n\nMoreover, an undercover Project Veritas video made clear that she supports numerous other gun controls that she does not mention to Missouri voters. Those controls include openness to a \u201csemiautomatic rifle ban.\u201d And the video begins with a giddy McCaskill, not knowing she was on video, bragging about her votes for a \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazine ban too.\n\nMcCaskill supported numerous gun controls in the wake of the February 14, 2018, Parkland high school shooting and explained her support of those gun controls by saying, \u201cI think some gun safety is needed in this country.\u201d Of course, \u201cgun safety\u201d is just leftist-jargon for gun control.\n\nOn November 3, 2018, NRA president Oliver North traveled to Missouri to campaign for pro-Second Amendment Senate candidate Josh Hawley (R).

In spite of having elected nothing but Republican governors since \u201898, we have for 25 years had a liberal activist majority on the State Supreme Court. There are various reasons for why it worked out that way but bottom line is that the way things stand now there are four liberal activists and three constitutionalists. A seven member court divided 4-3. We have mandatory retirement based on age for our judiciary and so you have three of the four liberal activists who are retiring the same time Governor (Rick) Scott leaves office. And so I come in and I am able to not only appoint three justices but these are three justices who are going to replace three liberal activist judges. So I will appoint solid constitutionalists who understand the proper role of the court is to apply the law in the Constitution as written. Not to rewrite the law. \u2026 And so these will be justices in the mold of Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court. And when I do that successfully, we will transform the court to a six-to-one constitutionalist court and then in one four-year term you get to replace the one remaining liberal activist. So you could serve one term as governor and leave the court seven to zero.\n\n\u201cThat will be a huge, huge change for the better and we will have effectively ended judicial activism in Florida for a generation,\u201d DeSantis added.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The TLP had mobilized massive protests across the country, blocking roads in and out of big cities, and had threatened to kill the three Supreme Court judges who had written the opinion freeing Asia. Even Pakistani media and politicians were alarmed at the extent of the government capitulation and wondered whether the government would survive.\n\n1. A review petition has been filed in the Aasia Bibi case, which is the right of the petitioners. The government will raise no objections over the review petition. 2. Due process will be followed immediately to include the name of Aasia Bibi in the Exit Control List (ECL). 3. Immediate legal action will be taken over the martyrdom of any individuals during the protest campaign against the acquittal of Aasia Bibi. 4. All those arrested on October 30 or afterwards in the protest campaign against Aasia Bibi\u2019s acquittal will be released immediately. 5. The TLP apologizes to anybody whose sentiments have been unnecessarily hurt during the incident.\n\nThe reference to the \u201cExit Control List (ECL)\u201d means that Asia\u2019s name will be placed on the airline list that prevents someone from leaving the country. The UK had sent a plane to take Asia to Europe, but it had to leave without her. Asia is said to be in protective custody somewhere.\n\nA number of people had been arrested during the three days of massive demonstration for destroying property and causing violence and the agreement says that they will be freed.\n\nThe only concession made by the terrorists is that they apologize for hurting people\u2019s feelings.\n\nA lot of people are now wondering whether Pakistan is ruled by Islamist terrorists. The new president Imran Khan initially said the following:\n\nI say to these people: do not confront this state \u2026 do not damage this country for your vote bank. If you do this, I promise that the government will do its duty \u2026 I ask you: do not force the government to have to take action.\n\nKhan did take action the next day \u2013 total capitulation.\n\nA lot of people congratulated the Supreme Court for its bravery in acquitting Asia, but are now wondering why Asia was not acquitted by a lower court long before this. One analyst answers as follows:\n\nPeople ask a question as to why Sessions Court and Lahore High Court convicted her for blasphemy and endorsed death penalty. There are mainly two reasons. First, it is obvious that death threats from the extremists who use Islam for their political gains that might have forced the judges; you have see the chaos by now, for which most judges were afraid of. Secondly, the judges of lower courts were not that courageous to take the risks of their lives for justice.\n\nThe News (Pakistan) and Deutsche Welle and The Nation (Pakistan) and Dunya News (Pakistan)\n\nQuestions about Mohammed\u2019s covenant with Christians and Christianity\n\nIt is not surprising that the TLPwase absolutely furious about the Supreme Court ruling, which I described three days ago. It was a scathing opinion not only that Asia was not a blasphemer, but that her accusers and, by implication, the Barelvi/TTP terrorists were themselves blasphemers, because they had blasphemed Asia\u2019s Christian belief, which Mohammed had ordered all Muslims to protect in a covenant.\n\nSeveral people asked for more information about this covenant, and whether it actually exists. The text of the covenant appears in the court opinion that I quoted in my previous article, and is repeated here:\n\nThis is a message from Muhammad ibn Abdullah, as a covenant to those who adopt Christianity, near and far, we are with them. Verily I, the servants, the helpers, and my followers defend them, because Christians are my citizens; and by God! I hold out against anything that displeases them. No compulsion is to be on them. Neither are their judges to be removed from their jobs nor their monks from their monasteries. No one is to destroy a house of their religion, to damage it, or to carry anything from it to the Muslims\u2019 houses. Should anyone take any of these, he would spoil God\u2019s covenant and disobey His Prophet. Verily, they are my allies and have my secure charter against all that they hate. No one is to force them to travel or to oblige them to fight. The Muslims are to fight for them. If a female Christian is married to a Muslim, it is not to take place without her approval. She is not to be prevented from visiting her church to pray. Their churches are to be respected. They are neither to be prevented from repairing them nor the sacredness of their covenants. No one of the nation (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day (end of the world).\n\nPossibly the best way to understand this covenant is to consider the phrase, \u201cVerily, they are my allies.\u201d The word \u201callies\u201d is used in a literal sense. The document was signed in 628 AD, when Mohammed was in the middle of a generational crisis war between his own Hashim clan versus the Umayyad clan in Mecca. Mohammed had nothing against the Christians and had no reason to fight them, so he promised to protect them.\n\nOver the centuries, Muslim nations have continued to protect Christians living among them, choosing to tax them rather than kill them. So Mohammed\u2019s covenant has been followed for 1400 years.\n\nEven today, Muslim jihadists are not killing Christians except for public relations purposes in high profile terrorist attacks. The number of Christians being killed is minuscule, compared to the number of Muslims being killed. More Christians are being killed in traffic accidents than by Muslim jihadists.\n\nA lot of this was discussed in my book, Iran\u2019s Struggle for Supremacy: Tehran\u2019s Obsession to Redraw the Map of the Middle East.\n\nFor the most part, it is Muslims who kill Muslims (Syria, Iraq, Yemen, etc.), and it is Christians who kill Christians \u2013 Nazis vs Russians, French and British, Hutus vs Tutsis, Russians vs Ukrainians and Georgians, etc. Most of the time, that is the way the world works.

For several years now, expressions of anti-Jewish sentiment have made up the preponderance of hate crime complaints in the city.\u201d\n\nSo where is the outrage?\n\nWhere are the headlines?\n\nWhere are the protests to \u201craise awareness?\u201d\n\nWhere is the endless cable news coverage?\n\nThere is none, and although the explanation for this indifference is hidden under more than a half-dozen paragraphs, the Times does at least deserve some credit for telling a disturbing truth: [emphasis added]\n\nIf anti-Semitism bypasses consideration as a serious problem in New York, it is to some extent because it refuses to conform to an easy narrative with a single ideological enemy. During the past 22 months, not one person caught or identified as the aggressor in an anti-Semitic hate crime has been associated with a far right-wing group, Mark Molinari, commanding officer of the police department\u2019s Hate Crimes Task Force, told me. \u2026 In fact, it is the varied backgrounds of people who commit hate crimes in the city that make combating and talking about anti-Semitism in New York much harder.\n\nIn other words, not once in the 22 months President Trump has been in office, has a single right-winger committed a hate crime against a Jew in New York.\n\nIt gets worse. The Times admits \u201cmainstream progressive [left-wing] advocacy groups\u201d simply do not care about attacks against Jews.\n\nObviously, those same groups would start caring a whole lot if an assault could be blamed on a Trump supporter. Without the \u201ccorrect\u201d enemy to blame it on, though, the left do not care, and that certainly includes the New York Times, which is only giving this outrage dutiful coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, other than a couple of anecdotes, the Times is not at all interested in who in fact is guilty of those 142 hate crimes against Jews.\n\nBut \u2014 hint, hint \u2014 we know it\u2019s not coming from those on the right.\n\nWhat this means is that in order to pin this rise in violence against Jews on Trump, the media only talk about the \u201crise in hate crimes under Trump\u201d while leaving inconvenient details unreported.\n\nA perfect example is how CNN is deliberately misleading its viewers this weekend by refusing to disclose the identity of the man suspected in an attack on a New York synagogue \u2014 and that man is James Polite, a \u201cDemocratic activist who once worked for New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, and also volunteered for Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nAnd here are two other men suspected of anti-Jewish hate crimes in New York, two men apparently caught on camera allegedly painting swastikas on homes in Brooklyn Heights.\n\nBut because they are not wearing Make America Great Again hats, it is no big deal to the political left or the establishment media.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

It says:\n\nWe, the undersigned businesses, stand with the millions of people in America who identify as transgender, gender non-binary, or intersex, and call for all such people to be treated with the respect and dignity everyone deserves. We oppose any administrative and legislative efforts to erase transgender protections through reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations. We also fundamentally oppose any policy or regulation that violates the privacy rights of those that identify as transgender, gender non-binary, or intersex.\n\nThe letter\u2019s signatories were organized by the Human Rights Council and Out Leadership. Both organizations have many gay and lesbian members in the leadership of many elite firms. Both groups have begun pushing the transgender ideology since the Supreme Court changed the nation\u2019s legal definition of marriage in a 2015 decision authored by now-retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. The pro-transgenderism advocacy is heavily funded by a network of wealthy transgender and gay advocates.\n\nThe corporate push is intended to block Trump from removing the tangle of pro-transgender policies and definitions that have been quietly slipped into the nation\u2019s patchwork of laws by judges and by officials working for former President Barack Obama.\n\nThose changes are pushed by advocates and judges who insist that a person\u2019s self-declared \u201cgender identity\u201d exists and also is more legally important than their biological sex \u2014 even though federal anti-discrimination law does not use the \u201cgender identity\u201d term.\n\nIf not removed, the gradual pro-transgender changes could be exploited by progressive judges on the Supreme Court to impose the unpopular transgender ideology nationwide.\n\nTrump\u2019s deputies have already removed many of Obama\u2019s changes.\n\nFor example, the Department of Defense has junked Obama\u2019s pro-transgender rules and has revived the \u201cbright line\u201d of biology to define male and female soldiers.\n\nThe Department of Education dropped Obama-era instructions to schools telling them to adopt the transgender ideology, and the Department of Justice is rolling back Obama\u2019s rules that allowed men who say they are women to be jailed in women\u2019s prisons. The Department of State has begun opposing legal agreements that use the \u201cgender\u201d term instead of male or female, for example, in statements that denounce violence against women.\n\nAn Oct. 21 New York Times report said Trump\u2019s officials had drafted a memo which defines a person\u2019s legal sex as \u201ca person\u2019s status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth.\u201d The policy would not reduce normal sex-discrimination protections for the tiny percentage of \u201ctransgender\u201d people trying to live as members of the other sex but would deny the claim that a person\u2019s \u201cgender identity\u201d is more important than biology when recording a person\u2019s legal sex.\n\nThe Trump policy would protect peoples\u2019 right to use and talk about single-sex institutions. Those institutions include single-sex showers and women\u2019s sports leagues, male and female ideals of behavior and appearance, scientific descriptions of male and female bodies, as well as single-sex civic groups for a wide variety of men or women, such as clubs for women executives or for lesbians.\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m protecting everybody,\u201d President Donald Trump said October 22. \u201cWe have a lot of different concepts right now. They have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now.\u201d\n\nFew GOP legislators openly criticize the ideology, but many Democratic legislators are backing the revolutionary ideology, despite the growing health risks to children:\n\n.@RepJoeKennedy has a message for all the young trans people out there \u2013 you are seen, you are heard, you are loved, and you #WontBeErased. pic.twitter.com/CsjsAGasuX \u2014 National Center for Transgender Equality (@TransEquality) November 2, 2018\n\nThe pro-transgender groups are also urging Massachusets voters to defeat a ballot amendment on Tuesday which would rollback a pro-transgender state law:\n\nMUST WATCH: Transgender activist and actress @LaverneCox gave an impassioned speech to Massachusetts residents to vote #YesOn3 to uphold the dignity and respect for the transgender community. #TransLawMA #mapoli pic.twitter.com/GQmtu9v6Sv \u2014 Human Rights Campaign (@HRC) November 4, 2018\n\nMedia reports portray the ideological dispute merely as an effort by Trump to eliminate existing rights for people who say they are transgender. But Congress has not set any protections for people who claim discrimination because of their transgender status, and few media articles mention the revolutionary political ambitions of the transgender ideology.\n\nThe central issue in the transgender vs. two-sex biology fight was outlined nine years ago by then-Democrat Rep. Barney Frank, a far-left Massachusetts Representative in Congress who was the leading advocate for creating new legal rights for gays and lesbians. He told National Journal in 2009:\n\nThat\u2019s the question\u2014whether the law should embody that principle [that this is a two-[sex] society], or should the law say to the very small minority of people who do not want to stay the same [sex] for the rest of their lives, that they will not be discriminated against \u2026 I\u2019m against discrimination based on anything other than the ability to do the job.\n\nThe transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex and people trying to \u201cdetransition\u201d back to their sex, men who say they are lesbians, masculine autogynephiles, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and medical service providers.\n\nDespite the growing damage to young people \u2014 including people who give up their claim to be \u201ctransgender\u201d and reclaim their sex \u2014 the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules which help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, children\u2019s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women\u2019s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.", "Militants of the Islamic State massacred 13 Christians in Minya, Egypt, opening fire Friday on busloads of pilgrims traveling to the monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor.\n\nThe jihadists fired upon three buses, ultimately blocking two of them while the third escaped. The gunmen ordered everyone to get out of the buses and then began shooting them in cold blood, the Vatican newspaper, L\u2019Osservatore Romano, reported Saturday.\n\nAmong those slaughtered by the militants were at least three children and seven women.\n\nThe Islamic State terror group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which mimicked a similar attack against Egyptian Christians en route to the same pilgrimage site in May, 2017.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) said the attack would probably \u201ccast a dark shadow\u201d over the World Youth Forum, one of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi\u2019s showpieces that opens Saturday in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh.\n\nOn Saturday, hundreds of Christians gathered in Minya for the funeral of six victims, five of whom were members of the same family.\n\nCommenting on the drama, the Coptic-Catholic bishop of Asyut Kyrillos William claimed that terrorists in Egypt \u201cwant to destabilize the state,\u201d reinforcing the belief that terrorism cannot be suppressed. They are saying that \u201cwe are still here and we are still active,\u201d the prelate added.\n\nBy their own admission, the Islamic State\u2019s attacks on Egypt\u2019s Christians are intended as a punishment for Coptic support of el-Sissi. It was el-Sissi who led the military\u2019s 2013 uprising that deposed an Islamist president, whose one-year rule had been divisive.\n\nAs Agence France Presse (AFP) reported in July, Islamist violence against Egypt\u2019s Christian community, one of the largest and oldest groups of Christians in the Middle East, \u201chas escalated at an alarming rate.\u201d\n\nBetween May and July, jihadists carried out at least a dozen attacks on Christians in Egypt, with little effective response from the government.\n\n\u201cIt is escalating in a very short time,\u201d said Mina Thabet, program director for minorities and vulnerable groups with the Egyptian Commission of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nOn Friday evening, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi condemned the attack, which \u201cwill not affect the will of our country in continuing the battle for survival and construction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirm our determination to continue our efforts to combat terrorism,\u201d el-Sissi said in a statement.\n\nCairo\u2019s Al-Azhar University also denounced Friday\u2019s attack, saying the perpetrators were \u201ccriminals devoid of the fundamental values \u200b\u200bof humanity, far from the teachings of religions that appeal to coexistence and peace, to renouncing violence and condemning the killing of innocent.\u201d\n\nFollow Thomas D.

McCarthy\u2019s outside group, Protect the House, has organized the townhall, and on it participants will have an opportunity to ask questions of Trump, Jr., and McCarthy. The group will call over one million identified low-propensity GOP voters in key districts across the country, offering them the opportunity to participate in the event and encouraging them to vote on Tuesday.\n\nMcCarthy, per a source familiar with the organization, came up with the idea for the large call as a way to engage with and rally grassroots voters in key districts in the final hours before they head to the polls.\n\nIt remains to be seen which party will control the majority of the U.S. House of Representatives heading into President Trump\u2019s second half of his first term in office after Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections, though most estimates have it hanging in the balance overall.

In other words, following the separate and extensive investigations by both the Committee and the FBI, there was no evidence to substantiate any of the claims of sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh.\n\nThe report notes that the committee has referred several individuals to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation who seemed to have made false statements against Kavanaugh to the committee.\n\nThe report also notes that the committee is investigating former FBI employee Monica McLean for allegedly urging accuser Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s best friend to change her statement disputing Ford\u2019s account of an alleged sexual assault:\n\nSeveral media outlets have reported that the FBI\u2019s supplemental report indicated that Leland Keyser, a friend of Dr. Ford, felt pressure from Dr. Ford\u2019s allies to revisit her initial statement to the Committee that she did not know Justice Kavanaugh or have any knowledge of the alleged incident.78 According to the news articles, Keyser reported that former FBI employee Monica McLean, whom Dr. Ford allegedly coached in a polygraph exam years earlier, and others contacted her to suggest she \u201cclarify\u201d her account.

The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People\u2026\u201d He was referring to \u201cCNN and others in the Fake News business,\u201d not foreign provocateurs. Surely every president has endured stories that he knew were inaccurate and has chaffed at one or more news publications. George Washington was routinely brutalized by a newspaper that had been anonymously funded and founded by his own Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson. But no American president has ever before vilified the American press or one of its professional outlets as an \u201cEnemy of the People.\u201d Attacking the media or publications that lean in a different direction than the Republican Party is decidedly good politics. We conservatives have long suffered from the left-leaning attitudes and reporting of the media. But today, if we don\u2019t like one outlet, there are others from which we can\u2014and do\u2014choose. And, more importantly, denigrating the media diminishes an institution that is critical to democracy, both here and abroad.

As The Washington Post noted, the spokesman for the group was Johnnie Moore, \u201cwho also serves as the White House\u2019s unofficial liaison to a group of well-known conservative evangelicals.\u201d\n\nAs for Israel\u2019s involvement, we might observe that the leader of the delegation was the best-selling author Joel Rosenberg, a Christian, born in the U.S. to a Jewish background, who now lives in Israel and is close to Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. As The Jerusalem Post relates, Netanyahu views Saudi Arabia as \u201can important strategic partner in the region.\u201d\n\nIn other words, this was high-level trip; it was, in fact, something of a summit conference, in which the views of three countries\u2014the U.S., Israel, and Saudi Arabia\u2014were amply represented. And yes, the crown prince and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Bin Salman, is that Mohammed Bin Salman, the man who stands accused of being somehow complicit in the Istanbul murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen, a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood and of Palestinian terror\u2014and a Washington Post columnist. So yes, Saudi Arabia is still a rough place; nobody ever said it was a Jeffersonian democracy. Yet what they say now, in addition, is that Saudi Arabia is increasingly linked with Israel and the U.S. And that\u2019s a big deal.\n\nAs Rosenberg said in an exclusive video obtained by CBN News:\n\nWe\u2019re under no illusions about the challenges that are in Saudi Arabia and that remain. But I think it\u2019s respectful to go and listen to leaders who have the opportunity to make life better for Christians and Muslims and potentially for Israel as well and who are against the crazies in Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood. I\u2019d ask people to pray. Pray for the (Jordanian) king. Prayer for the crown prince. Pray for the people of Saudi Arabia. And I think it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nSo it certainly seems that everyone involved has his or her eyes open. The issue at hand is not that Saudi Arabis is going to become like the U.S., or Israel. Instead, the issue is that the Saudis might potentially cement an alliance with both the Americans and the Israelis. If so, that\u2019s a huge development.\n\nAfter all, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that Saudi Arabia was an implacable enemy of the Jewish State. Arabia is, after all, the birthplace of the Prophet Mohammed, and the homeland of the Islamic faith. Indeed, in the past, Saudi Arabia has not only used its religious influence to foster anti-Israel hatred, but, in addition, it has used its oil wealth to finance Arab armies.\n\nYet all that hostility could be changing. Why? Two reasons:\n\nFirst, the Palestinian issue has dissipated. It\u2019s been seven decades since the Palestinians were made refugees during the Israeli War of Independence, and so understandably, memories of that conflict are fading as Palestinians have been absorbed into other countries. Moreover, once the Trump administration made clear that it was not interested in pursuing the familiar approach of endless negotiations over a phantom \u201ctwo-state solution,\u201d well, the Arabs realized that it was finally time to move on.\n\nSecond, the menace of Iran has concentrated Middle Eastern minds. To put it bluntly, the Saudis are terrified of Iran. The Persians and Arabs are historic rivals, even enemies. Moreover, most Arabs, including most Saudis, are Sunni Muslim, and the Persians are mostly Shia Muslim\u2014and as the U.S. learned in Iraq, that sectarian split is deep. And of course, the current Iranian regime, warlike and aggressive as it is, poses a uniquely dangerous threat to just about every other country in the region.\n\nSo with Iran as the common enemy, Jews and Arabs have grown closer together. Yet let\u2019s give due credit, as well, to the diplomacy of the Trump administration. Back in May 2017, the President chose Saudi Arabia as the destination for his first foreign trip. One goal, of course, was to secure that $110 billion package of arms sales, but by now it\u2019s clear that behind the scenes, the geopolitical wheel was turning.\n\nOf course, the MSM and its allies don\u2019t like any of this. Why? As Virgil noted last month, in a piece headlined, \u201cMedia, Dems, and Deep Staters Try to Tank Trump\u2019s America First Saudi Policy,\u201d the MSM and the Democrats are so heavily invested in hating on Trump that they don\u2019t want him to succeed at anything, no matter how beneficial it might be to the U.S. and its allies.\n\nOkay, so that\u2019s how the #Resistance sees the situation\u2014as a bizarro world where bad news is good and good news is bad. Yet for Trump, and for Americans, the future in the Middle East is looking a lot brighter.", "Law enforcement officials say three Girl Scouts and one woman collecting trash on the side of a western Wisconsin road have been killed in a hit-and-run crash.\n\nThe Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports the driver of the pickup that hit the group fled the scene but is now in police custody.\n\nThe driver of the pickup that hit the group, 21-year-old Colten Treu of nearby Chippewa Falls, Wis., fled the scene but later turned himself in, according to Sgt.

Which one sounds like your own vision for the country?\n\nFLAKE: I certainly don\u2019t like the tone that President Trump has taken with regard to blaming immigrants. Having that ad, which I thought was just sickening. And frankly, very untrue with regard to the threat that is posed by illegal immigrants. And the notion that Democrats have prevented any fix, the last real vote we had on substantial immigration reform was the bipartisan bill we did in 2013. Every Democrat in the Senate voted for that bill, which included about $41 billion for additional border security. That\u2019s more than the president has even asked for on border security. So this notion that this is all the Democrats\u2019 fault is just wrong.\n\nBLITZER: It sounds like you\u2019re more in line with former President Obama than you are with the current president, President Trump.\n\nFLAKE: Well, certainly the tone.

Their laws and regulations impact our livelihoods. They make decisions impacting cherished freedoms such as speech, religion, conscience, security, and privacy. They decide how much money to spend and how much we pay in taxes to run the government. They are a part of deciding whether we will be a country of order and the rule of law or whether we will continue with immigration laws that are ineffective and unmanageable. They help set the direction of our cities, states, and our country.\n\n\u201cAre these issues important to you?\u201d Graham asked. \u201cThen you need to research the options on the ballot, PRAY and ask God for His wisdom, and make sure you VOTE.\u201d", "Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate former Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) told Breitbart News Washington political editor Matt Boyle on Sirius XM\u2019s Breitbart News Saturday that he is \u201crunning against a guy who wants a 40 percent tax increase in Florida.\u201d\n\nDeSantis is in a close battle for governor with the Democratic candidate, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, in Tuesday\u2019s election. DeSantis resigned his seat in Congress shortly after winning the Republican primary for governor in August in order to focus exclusively on the race.\n\n\u201cYesterday we got new job numbers, 250,000 jobs added in the month of October alone. A thousand manufacturing jobs a day. Unemployment still down at 3.7 percent. We haven\u2019t seen unemployment that low for a long time. We\u2019ve got a three percent rise in wages. What do you make of the new jobs numbers and how important is that going into Tuesday?\u201d Boyle asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as good a jobs report as you could really get,\u201d De Santis said.\n\n\u201cI think the economy is humming. I think that clearly we\u2019re much better off than we were several years ago under Obama\u2019s policies. I think most voters get that,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI think the issue is how much is the economy going to drive voters\u2019 choices? People say everyone always votes with their pocket book. I think what happens is, when the economy is doing well, sometimes voters just take it for granted. To the extent they are really focusing on the economy, I think it\u2019s a slam dunk for Republicans like me,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running against a guy who wants a 40 percent tax increase in Florida. That would destroy jobs and hurt business,\u201d De Santis told Boyle.\n\n\u201cThere are certain voters who will not give President Trump credit for anything. You even saw [former President] Obama yesterday down in Florida trying to take credit for the economy! We had such a lackluster economy when he was president, and now these great numbers, and he\u2019s trying to say that\u2019s because of him, which is just laughable!\u201d\n\n\u201cBetween what Congress did and what the president did unilaterally, you had the biggest reduction in bureaucracy and red tape that had been really strangling a lot of creative energy in the economy. We passed a generationally significant tax reform, which simplified the tax code, lowered business rates so we\u2019re not shipping jobs overseas anymore, and also lowered individual rates so people have more money to be able to do what they need to do rather than what the government needs to do.\u201d\n\nDeSantis also commented on President Trump\u2019s rally in Pensacola Saturday night.\n\n\u201cThe Florida panhandle is a very good place for votes for people like me,\u201d De Santis told Boyle.\n\n\u201cThese rallies are energizing the Republican faithful. It\u2019s helping us turn out more voters. We actually right now, in Florida, with the early and absentee returns, we\u2019re about a percent and a half ahead of the Democrats. We\u2019ve always been behind at this stage, and then we have to catch up on election day, so we\u2019re over performing in terms of what everyone thought we would be able to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still working at it. We need everyone to turn out, but I think the energy on our side is really unprecedented for a midterm election with the president being of our party,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nYou can listen to the full interview here:", "Jane Fonda compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler at the Women\u2019s Media Awards on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve read anything about the rise of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler, you will see the parallels,\u201d Fonda maintained. \u201cAttacking the media is the first step in the move towards fascism.\u201d\n\nFonda, given her wild misjudgment of the only American to systematically murder scores of his fellow countrymen in an actual concentration camp, strikes as the wrong messenger bearing the wrong message here.\n\nBefore Jane Fonda saw Donald Trump as Adolf Hitler, she saw Jim Jones as a hero.\n\n\u201cWe are familiar with the work of Reverend Jones and Peoples Temple,\u201d Fonda, along with husband Tom Hayden, San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk, reporter Paul Avery, California assemblyman Willie Brown, and other progressives, avowed in 1977, \u201cand have no hesitancy in commending them for their example in setting a high standard of ethics and morality in the community and also for providing enormous material assistance to poor, minority and disadvantaged people in every area of human need.\u201d\n\nFonda denied joining Peoples Temple. She did attend a Temple service. In researching Cult City: Jim Jones, Harvey Milk, and 10 Days That Shook San Francisco, Jane Fonda\u2019s name came up repeatedly, albeit no less shockingly each time, as a devoted supporter of Jim Jones. And other researchers uncovered a particularly damning letter sent after her visit to Peoples Temple: \u201cI also recommit myself to your congregation as an active full participant\u2014not only for myself, but because I want my two children to have the experience.\u201d\n\nJim Jones certainly thought of her as a member of his flock. At an anti-suicide event at Golden Gate Bridge in 1977, Jones cited Fonda as a reason for releasing him from the doldrums. The Peoples Temple leader noted, eerily in light of the mass suicide at Jonestown, that \u201cat one time or other we have all felt the alienation and despair. I think the despair got to me yesterday. If it hadn\u2019t been for an Academy Award winning actress joining our church \u2026 I think I would have been in a suicidal mood myself today for perhaps the first time in my life, so I have a particular and personal empathy for what we are doing here today.\u201d\n\nIn Jonestown, Peoples Temple screened the Jane Fonda film Julia. \u201cI was of course particularly interested,\u201d Temple member Edith Roller reflected in her diary, \u201cbecause of the connection of Fonda with the Temple.\u201d The Temple viewed Fonda as so important that they assigned her a codename\u2014Xavier\u2014for use on shortwave transmissions between Guyana and the United States.\n\nLike so many who paid tribute to Jim Jones, Fonda eventually did not see her well-wishes reciprocated. One Temple transcript shows Marceline Jones, wife of the leader, unable to reach Fonda by telephone. Did she sour on Jim Jones? Jones surely soured on her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a sellout. That\u2019s what pains,\u201d Jones told his flock in Jonestown.\n\nClaiming to read from media reports in the United States, Jones on another occasion fantastically informed his followers: \u201cJane Fonda will not have anything to do with her former liberal friends, having at one time in her highest moments, gave her body for some fifty thousand dollars to help the [Black] Panthers, she\u2019s now playing it safe, and on a quest in her middle years to be popular and acceptable, and hopes to see her husband become president.\u201d\n\nHe labeled Fonda, who launched a series of successful exercise videos and won an Oscar and an Emmy after her dalliance with Peoples Temple, \u201cover the hill.\u201d He lashed out at Tom Hayden as a \u201cstupid, sick punk.\u201d\n\nJust as Fonda\u2019s politics led her to make outlandish claims about the president, her politics led her to make outlandish statements about the preacher. In both instances, she let passion overtake reason. Donald Trump is as much Adolf Hitler as Jim Jones was a man who set \u201ca high standard of ethics and morality.\u201d\n\nFonda\u2019s interviewers over the years raise such indelicate subjects as her plastic surgeries and her trip to North Vietnam when the United States fought a war against the Communist nation. But her support for America\u2019s most prolific mass murderer remains a subject too far down the memory hole to raise.\n\nA biographer reports Fonda confessing her biggest regret as not jumping into bed with Che Guevara. Remorse for jumping into bed with Peoples Temple, strangely, did not rise to that level.\n\nDaniel J.

She pointed out that Border Patrol agents are denied the authority to detain and remove individuals from non-contiguous countries like those in Central America.\n\nSchlapp addressed the issue of healthcare and the measures that the Trump administration has been able to take to mitigate the fallout of skyrocketing Obamacare premiums. She spoke of short-term and associated health care plans. She said the goal currently is more choices and greater accessibility, but they hope to do more. Schlapp pointed to the decrease in options under Obamacare and that Democrats are pushing for centralized healthcare that would decrease options further.\n\nBoyle proposed that Americans need to ask if they\u2019re better off than they were two years ago. \u201cThe answer is definitely yes,\u201d Schlapp said.\n\n\u201cRemember, it was President [Barack] Obama who campaigned on hope and change. The real hope and change is coming under President Trump and those Republicans who have worked hard to basically push forward his agenda,\u201d said Schlapp. \u201cI really believe that we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nShe then added, \u201cThere is still so much to do in terms of investing in our American workers, renegotiating these trade deals.\u201d Schlapp said, in order to secure economic security and the borders, where Democrats have been silent.

To me, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez replied to Ramos. \u201cWell, I believe that he has violated the law. Violated potentially many laws, whether it\u2019s the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with. Whether it\u2019s what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez also said impeaching Trump should not be \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d because of how Republicans impeached former President Bill Clinton for lying under oath.\n\n\u201cBut overall, you look at the bar that the Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton and somehow impeaching Donald Trump is supposed to be beyond the pale? It seems ridiculous to me,\u201d she added.\n\nThough Ocasio-Cortez said she believes Trump should be impeached because he committed a crime, other Democrats like Rep. Al Green (D-TX) have insisted that Trump \u201cdoes not have to commit a crime to be impeached.\u201d In fact, Green has argued that Trump could be impeached simply for \u201charming society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, the president is not likely to be indicted, which means he\u2019s not likely to be found guilty of a crime while he\u2019s sitting, which means that if this comes before the House, it won\u2019t come before the House as a president who has been found guilty, but rather as a president who is alleged to have committed certain offenses that are onerous to the Constitution and that harm society,\u201d Green said during an August Democracy Now interview. \u201cAnd what this president is doing is harming society.\u201d\n\nTop Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), aware that impeachment is not a popular issue among Americans, has previously said that talk of impeachment before the midterms would be a \u201cgift\u201d to Republicans. But left-wing Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez, egged on by the party\u2019s left-wing base that may not settle for anything less than impeachment if Democrats take back the House, have been ignoring Pelosi\u2019s warnings to be disciplined and not talk about impeachment before Special Counsel Robert Mueller concludes his investigation.", "A group of moms from across the United States are traveling to Texas to meet with mothers who live on the U.S. border with Mexico. The coalition is calling for the federal government to secure the border so that the thousands of migrants marching through Mexico aren\u2019t allowed to enter the country.\n\nMoms for America will hold a press conference on Sunday to express their support for sending the military to the border, the construction of a wall on the border, and for federal immigration law to be enforced to protect American families from criminals or other bad actors who could be embedded in the migrant caravan.\n\n\u201cWomen and children are most at risk on both sides of the border,\u201d Kimberly Fletcher, founder and president of Moms for America told Breitbart News. \u201cOur lack of border security has actually created an industry which brutalizes women, criminalizes children, and rips families apart.\u201d\n\nShe also questioned why men who are seeking asylum because their home country is too dangerous are leaving behind their wives and children to fend for themselves.\n\n\u201cHuman trafficking, drug trafficking, rape trees, abandoned women and children \u2014 those are the things mothers are suffering from on the other side of the border,\u201d Fletcher said.\n\nFletcher said it is time that mothers be heard on a topic that affects their families and communities.\n\n\u201cMoms have a powerful influence in our country and culture \u2014 in fact, they are the most powerful influence,\u201d said Fletcher, who started the organization to highlight the importance of mothers and to give conservative women a voice.\n\n\u201cWhen you start any conversation with \u2018as a Mom\u2019 people listen,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we bring common sense to this issue \u2014 mommy sense!\u201d\n\nFletcher said hundreds of mothers have expressed support of the moms\u2019 caravan, even if they can\u2019t travel to the border.\n\n\u201cThey feel this is their opportunity to bring common sense to the issue, to share their fear and frustrations and hope government officials will listen, fix this broken system, and make protecting women and children on both of sides of the border their highest priority by securing our borders,\u201d Fletcher said.\n\nShe said women from across the country have shared their stories on the Moms for America website, and others have contacted Fletcher and her team.\n\n\u201cWe spoke with a teacher who said they are inundated with illegal aliens in their schools,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cThe schools are required to accept them, and the teachers are required to accommodate them, providing special classes and interpreters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they object or even express concerns, they are reprimanded,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cThey fear losing their jobs if they say anything.\u201d\n\nAnother mother said her children witnessed a group of men coming out of a ravine in a border city while waiting for their school bus.\n\nThe Moms for America press conference will take place in McAllen, Texas at 2:30 p.m. central time on Sunday and will be livestreamed on their Facebook page.\n\nFollowing the press conference, the group will caravan by car for the two-mile trip to the border.\n\n\u201cAll we are asking is for our government to protect us,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cSo that we can feel safe in our homes and communities.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "Saturday at 7:30 p.m. ET, President Donald Trump will host a rally at Pensacola International Airport in Pensacola, FL.\n\nVideo courtesy of the Right Side Broadcast Network\n\nFollow Breitbart.tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo", "Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), the Republican nominee for United States Senate in Tennessee, joined Breitbart News Saturday to discuss the contentious Tennessee United States Senate race and the dangers emanating from the Democratic party.\n\nTrump is set to attend a rally in Tennessee Sunday to support Blackburn. Blackburn says she and her supporters are looking forward to his arrival.\n\n\u201cWe are just so excited,\u201d said Blackburn as she spoke about the upcoming rally. \u201cPeople are just clamoring to get in. It\u2019s so interesting.\u201d\n\nBlackburn spoke on the current economy and job numbers and explained that it will play a \u201cvitally important\u201d role in this year\u2019s election cycle.\n\n\u201cPeople want to have more money in their paycheck and more disposable income. And with the jobless numbers yesterday, I think what it proved, is that once again the steps that have been taken by President Trump and a Republican-held Senate and House have put us on the path to economic growth and productivity,\u201d exclaimed Blackburn. \u201cThat is what people are wanting to see. It is allowing them to build their version of the American dream.\u201d\n\nBlackburn then discussed the dangers of Democrats halting America\u2019s current economic progress by outlining a number of things current Democrats have vowed to do if they get the majority.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve said the first thing they are going to do is to impeach President Trump. Dianne Feinstein, who would chair the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said the first thing she is going to do is reopen the Kavanaugh investigations,\u201d explained Blackburn. \u201cWhat they will do is continue this search and destroy type mindset.\u201d\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren, who would be the head of the Senate Finance Committee, has said her first step would be to repeal the Trump tax cuts and her second move would be to put a tax increase in its place,\u201d Blackburn added.\n\nBlackburn\u2019s challenger, Democrat Phil Bredesen, said he would support Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States on the eve of the Kavanaugh vote. A video from Project Veritas revealed Bredesen campaign staffers referring to his statement as \u201ca political move.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat video must have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times,\u201d claimed Blackburn. \u201cHe made his mind up after the vote, not before, after.\u201d\n\nBlackburn says Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer told Bredesen to announce that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh.\n\n\u201cChuck Schumer is already calling the shots on Phil Bredesen and we know that,\u201d stated Blackburn.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re admitting that what they are out here selling to people is a falsehood,\u201d said Blackburn. \u201cThey have no intention of following through on those commitments or those premises or working in that manner. It\u2019s so disingenuous.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of immigration, Blackburn outlined what she would like to see happen if elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cThere are several things that can be done. Build the wall. Fund the wall so that you diminish the number of times these caravans, or many caravans, or people approaching the southern border,\u201d explained Blackburn. \u201cThere is a right way and a wrong way to come to the United States. Coming as an invading force is the wrong way to try to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received, legally, about one million legal immigrants each year. We receive people gladly and seek to protect people who are facing persecution,\u201d Blackburn asserted. \u201cLet\u2019s just be sure we are following our immigration laws and let\u2019s be sure that we secure the border, that our border patrol has the tools and resources they need to protect our nation\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d\n\nBlackburn also explained that she would move forward with her legislation to freeze the DACA program, should she be elected.\n\nRegarding tech companies and the massive censorship of conservatives and pro-life accounts, Blackburn explained her distaste.\n\n\u201cI have been after, been in behind, these big tech companies because what they are doing is subjectively manipulating their algorithms,\u201d said Blackburn. \u201cWe just want to make certain that we go get some things on the books and that they understand they can not subjectively manipulate \u2026 they cannot censor free speech.\u201d\n\nBlackburn also touched on the crude behavior of the left, saying \u201cpeople are tired of this.\u201d\n\nListen to Marsha Blackburn on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125:", "President Donald Trump ridiculed the talking heads on

The group has worked with other hard-left organizations headed by activists such as Michael Bloomberg and Al Sharpton.\n\nIn the latest ad, Moore and Dawson rip into the Trump administration accusing President Trump of \u201cviolating international law\u201d and \u201cputting children in jails.\u201d\n\nAccording to a press release, the video exclaims that \u201cTrump violated international law by detaining children and families who were legally seeking asylum, cruelly separated families and placed the children in cages, and that when released from detention centers, asylum-seekers are left without food or money. Furthermore, many immigrants were packed into \u2018ice boxes\u2019 where the temperature is kept at 56 degrees, resulting in many of them getting sick.\u201d\n\nOf course, all the claims in the ad are left-wing propaganda. Indeed, as the video heaps all the blame on President Donald Trump, the fact is that these \u201ccages\u201d have been in use for years and even Barack Obama\u2019s administration employed the policy of separating children from adults illegally entering the United States.\n\nIn June of 2018 leftists began sharing photos on social media showing illegal alien children detained in fenced immigration facilities. But leftists incorrectly claimed the photos depicted children detained during the Trump administration. It turned out that all the photos then being blamed on Trump were actually taken in 2014 during the Obama regime.\n\nObama had enforced this policy at least as far back as 2014.\n\n\u201cIn the summer of 2014, when the number of families and unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border began to sharply increase, the Obama administration began putting hundreds of families into immigration detention facilities. Critics called the detention centers overcrowded, dirty and ill-equipped,\u201d The L.A. Times reported on June 19.\n\nFurther, the policy employed to separate children from illegal aliens storming over the border was put in place in the late 1990s during the Bill Clinton-era and has been in place ever since and employed at varying levels of intensity.\n\nFinally, one of the main reasons for the policy is to stop the human trafficking of children. One of the reasons children are separated from the adults that bring them into the country illegally is because these children are often used as shields by people who turn out not to be the children\u2019s parents. Indeed, during the Trump administration arrests for human trafficking have surged.\n\n\u201cThrough late June 2018, human trafficking arrests for the year approached 6,000. That\u2019s nearly double the year prior (which itself marked an all-time high), and triple the year before that,\u201d Political Insider reported in July. \u201cHuman trafficking-related arrests never topped 2,000 under the Obama administration and were a paltry 300 in 2010.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "The video below, compiled by the Media Research Center, is not a compilation gathered from the darkest recesses of the Internet, is not cherry-picked from some obscure left-wing YouTube show\u2026 This is the establishment media, this is CNN, this is NBC News, this is the Washington Post, this is the New York Times, this is ABC News, and this is CBS attacking President Trump and his supporters as \u201cNazis,\u201d \u201cwhite supremacists,\u201d a \u201cvirus,\u201d and \u201cunfit to be human.\u201d\n\nHere is a rundown of the clips:\n\nNBC News\u2019s Andrea Mitchell compares Trump to Stalin, says he is undermining democracy.\n\nMSNBC panelist attacks Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller as \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d and attacks Trump supporters as \u201cwhite nationalists.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Max Boot praises Iran\u2019s leadership as more \u201cstable and rational\u201d than Trump.\n\nMSNBC Morning Joe panelist attacks Trump as a \u201cvirus.\u201d\n\nCNN anchor tells viewers Trump \u201csided with\u201d America\u2019s \u201cenemies\u201d in a \u201cbetrayal the likes of which we\u2019ve never seen.\u201d\n\nCNN panelist calls Trump a \u201cracist\u201d three times in five seconds.\n\nMSNBC staffer says Trump is \u201cdeeply un-American,\u201d compares him to Hitler.\n\nMSNBC Morning Joe anchor compares Trump to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.\n\nMSNBC Morning Joe staffer says all Trump supporters are \u201clike Nazis,\u201d declares Trump \u201cevil.\u201d\n\nMSNBC panelist calls the Trump administration \u201cterrorists\u201d who are part of a \u201cwhite nationalist government\u201d that \u201cputs guns to the heads\u201d of children.\n\nNBC News staffer compares Trump\u2019s immigration policy (which is no different from Obama\u2019s) to a \u201cconcentration camp.\u201d\n\nMSNBC Morning Joe anchor charges that Trump\u2019s immigration policy (which is no different from Obama\u2019s) is \u201cjust like the Nazis.\u201d\n\nOn ABC News\u2019s The View Trump is attacked as a \u201cbigot.\u201d\n\nMSNBC Morning Joe Anchor compares Trump to \u201cMussolini.\u201d\n\nMSNBC Morning Joe anchor says Trump \u201cchannels Joseph Stalin.\u201d\n\nMSNBC panelist says the Republican Party is the \u201cthe Party of the KKK.\u201d (The KKK was founded by Democrats.)\n\nNew York Times columnist attacks Trump as a \u201cdisturbed person.\u201d\n\nMorning Joe anchor says sources told him Trump is \u201cmentally unfit\u201d and has \u201cdementia.\u201d\n\nMSNBC panelist says \u201cTrump isn\u2019t just a white supremacist; he\u2019s a flat-out, full racist.\u201d\n\nCNN staffer says Trump is \u201cunfit to be human.\u201d\n\nCBS late night host calls Trump\u2019s mouth \u201cPutin\u2019s cockholster.\u201d\n\nDuring October, there were seven violent attacks on GOP centers; nine assaults and attempted assaults against Trump supporters; an assassination attempt against Trump; an assassination attempt against a Republican senator; the New York Times published fantasies about Trump being assassinated, and there were a dozen recorded rape and death threats aimed at Trump, his supporters, and even their children.\n\nOn top of that, all in one month, three high-ranking Democrats have called for violence and incivility, and CNN said left-wing mobs have the \u201cconstitutional right\u201d to chase Republican out of public spaces.\n\nDuring the Trump era, there have been more than 630 recorded acts of assassination attempts, mob violence, harassment, vandalism, menacing, and the establishment media justifying and encouraging more \u2014 all of it aimed at Trump and his supporters.\n\nThe hatred and fomenting of violence coming from the media only grew more intense during the last week as Trump was repeatedly blamed for an appalling crime committed by someone who hates him (specifically because of Trump\u2019s support for Jews); the media compared Trump and his supporters to ISIS, and the media openly declared \u201cwhite men\u201d a threat to America and asked \u201cwhat are we going to do about\u201d them.\n\nAnd then, after all of this, after smearing us as \u201cNazis\u201d and \u201cracists\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d and \u201cunfit to be human,\u201d the media say they are not our \u201cenemy\u201d and then demand we soul search about the division we are sowing in the country.\n\nThankfully, nearly two-thirds of the public is not falling for it.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

I mean, if the Democrats win and win big, there\u2019s probably a much greater chance that she will be the speaker. Because there are a large number of members who, frankly, are running right now and have said to their constituents they will not vote for her. I think that\u2019s unfortunate, but that\u2019s the way it is. And so, they probably will not vote for her, or that\u2019s going to begin \u2014 that would be the beginning of the end of their political career. So, she\u2019d have to have a lot of votes to spare in order, I think, for her to win that seat.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "An illegal alien from Mexico accused of stabbing his wife to death on Sunday was released from an Oregon county jail seven months ago despite federal immigration authorities\u2019 request to deport him, immigration officials said.\n\nMartin Gallo-Gallardo, 45, is facing murder charges in connection with the death of Coral Rodriguez-Lorenzo, 38, after authorities discovered her body in a ditch near a river east of Portland on October 28.\n\nAuthorities say Gallo-Gallardo was charged with murder for fatally stabbing Rodriguez-Lorenzo multiple times after an argument. The Mexican national pleaded not guilty to the murder charges Tuesday.\n\nBut immigration officials say this crime could have been prevented had Oregon law enforcement officials complied with federal immigration laws.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials said immigration officials placed a civil detainer on Gallo-Gallardo when authorities discovered during an arrest in Portland seven months ago for felony domestic violence charges that the Mexican national was in the country illegally.\n\nICE said the Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Department did not honor immigration authorities\u2019 request to deport him because of Oregon\u2019s sanctuary laws.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that law enforcement agencies like the Multnomah County jail refuse to work with ICE to promote public safety by holding criminals accountable and providing justice and closure for their victims,\u201d said Tanya J. Roman, a spokeswoman for the ICE regional office that covers Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska.\n\nBut officials with Multnomah County said Friday they never received the detainer request from ICE and are not allowed to recognize civil detainer requests because of a 2014 federal court ruling.\n\nMultnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese said Friday that his office did not receive the ICE detainer request faxed to his office due to an error in transmission.\n\nThe case comes as Oregon voters head to the polls Tuesday to decide if they will repeal the state\u2019s sanctuary city law, which prevents local law enforcement officials from detaining people arrested for immigration violations who have not been charged with other crimes. The law has been in place since 1987.", "President Donald Trump is defending all women from legal and cultural erasure by the transgender lobby, say medical and legal experts.\n\n\u201cThis is the irony \u2026 he is the U.S. women\u2019s rights champion\u201d because he is preventing men from inserting themselves into the legal and cultural definition of women, said Dr. Michelle Cretella, the executive director of the American College of Pediatricians.\n\n\u201cIt is true \u2026 Yes, oh my God,\u201d she said as she laughed at the irony.\n\n\u201cWhat Transgenderism requires is that [the term] \u2018gender identity\u2019 replace \u2018sex\u2019 in the law,\u201d Cretella told Breitbart News. If that happens, then men who say they have a female \u201cgender identity\u201d will be legally defined by the federal government as women, and \u201cwe can longer distinguish legally between males and females \u2026 [because we] have just eliminated the [biology-based] legal definition of women,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat is female erasure by definition,\u201d she said.\n\nTransgender activists \u201care trying to erase the male and female [sexes] and turn [society] into a mishmash of 50 or 93 [gender] whatevers,\u201d said Dr. Jane Orient, the executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. Their political goal is difficult to appreciate, she said, because \u201cit is hard to think about things that are really crazy.\u201d\n\nTrump hinted at this larger political fight on Monday when he was asked about his agency\u2019s proposal to document each person\u2019s sex by their biology, not by their declared \u201cGender Identity,\u201d which was the policy pushed by President Barack Obama. Officials need to define \u201csex\u201d because federal laws bar discrimination based on sex.\n\nAn Oct. 21 New York Times report said Trump\u2019s officials have drafted a memo which defines a person\u2019s legal sex as \u201ca person\u2019s status as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m protecting everybody,\u201d President Donald Trump said October 22. \u201cWe have a lot of different concepts right now. They have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now.\u201d\n\nOn October 24, Trump\u2019s Department of Justice asked the Supreme court to strike down a court decision which said laws against sexual discrimination must be extended to include discrimination against people who declare an opposite-sex \u201cGender Identity.\u201d The department said \u201cthe court of appeals\u2019 conclusion that gender-identity discrimination categorically constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII is incorrect \u2026 the ordinary meaning of \u201csex\u201d does not refer to gender identity.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s deputies are also pushing the United Nations to drop the use of \u201cgender.\u201d For example, officials prefer that the phrase \u201cviolence against women\u201d be used in U.N. documents instead of the open-ended \u201cgender-based violence\u201d terminology.\n\nWomen activists \u201care not happy about his personal life, but we support his policy,\u201d Cretella told Breitbart News.\n\nThe vast majority of articles about the transgender ideology focus on politicians\u2019 support or opposition to the creation of legal rights for people who want to live as members of the other sex.\n\nThe ideological disputes and potential consequences for society are ignored by reporters who uncritically embrace the movement\u2019s contradictory logic. For example, many reporters use now the vague \u201cgender\u201d term instead of relying on biological sex to distinguish between men and women. Many reporters also accept the claim that doctors \u201cassign\u201d a person\u2019s sex when they are born, even though sex is determined by each person\u2019s genes nine months before birth.\n\nVery few journalists address the concerns by women\u2019s rights campaigners \u2014 on the right, the left, in nonpartisan groups, and from lesbian-rights and feminist activists in the U.S., in Canada and the U.K \u2014 that women are being erased in law and culture by aggressive advances of men who say they are women. The media passivity exists despite transgender activists\u2019 openly advertising their intention to \u201cBreak the Binary\u201d \u2014 to erase the legal and cultural distinctions between two equal, different and complementary biological sexes.\n\nThe central issue in the transgender vs. biology fight was outlined nine years ago by then-Democrat Rep. Barney Frank, a far-left Massachusetts Representative in Congress who was the leading advocate for creating new legal rights for gays and lesbians. He told National Journal in 2009:\n\nThat\u2019s the question\u2014whether the law should embody that principle [that this is a two-[sex] society], or should the law say to the very small minority of people who do not want to stay the same [sex] for the rest of their lives, that they will not be discriminated against \u2026 I\u2019m against discrimination based on anything other than the ability to do the job.\n\nFrank dismissed concerns that the erasure of legal distinctions between the two sexes could have unpredictable effects on society. \u201cThat is the grossest stupidity that I\u2019ve heard in many years \u2026 Totally stupid \u2026 there is zero evidence for it.\u201d\n\nBut supporters of a normal, two-sex, binary male-and-female society say there is massive and growing evidence that the transgender ideology is eroding women\u2019s rights and status, even though the ideology has not been written into law by Congress.\n\nThe trend is clear in the sports sector.\n\nOn October 14, a man who said he is a woman was allowed to enter and win a women\u2019s sprint-racing cycling championship, bumping one woman off the podium and two other women to steps below his gold-medal step.\n\nThe man, who is named Rachel McKinnon, touted his victory via Twitter:\n\nMcKinnon argues that he is a woman because he has the \u201cgender identity\u201d of a woman. \u201cI\u2019m a woman. I have a body. Therefore, I have a woman\u2019s body,\u201d he argues.\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s victory in the race came at the cost of at least five other women.\n\nBreitbart News could not readily find the name of the woman who was erased from the top-three ranking and pushed off the podium.\n\nThird-place winner Jen Wagner protested the decision to allow the man to join the women\u2019 race, saying it was not fair to women.\n\nYou were not 3rd place. You are a hero amongst lesser men x @jkwagnermd https://t.co/QmLZOy4q72 \u2014 Katie Hopkins (@KTHopkins) October 16, 2018\n\nBut Wagner later submitted to pro-transgender activists following public criticism. She erased the \u201cNOT fair\u201d Tweet and apologized to the man:\n\nThey were just inflammatory, and that's not who I want to be or am. While I may not agree with the rules, when I pin on a number I agree to race by them. I also respect @rachelvmckinnon 's right to compete within the rules. \u2014 jen wagner-assali (@jkwagnermd) October 18, 2018\n\nI apologize, @rachelvmckinnon , for not properly congratulating you on race day.

The match sprint is the shortest race in cycling, and is dominated by larger and more powerful riders.

Haraguchi (@veloracer3) October 16, 2018\n\nAnother leading woman racer, Sarah Fader, erased herself from the race in protest at McKinnon\u2019s entry, according to an Oct. 18 article by Fred Dreier at VeloNews:\n\nKnown by some cycling fans for her maiden name, Caravella, Fader raced in the U.S. professional road scene from 2006-2015. Fader was set to race against Dr. McKinnon in the masters finals in Los Angeles. She was the defending masters world champion in the event, and she set the fastest time in the qualifying heats. She beat Dr. McKinnon in both a 200- and 500-meter time trial during the weekend. Fader, however, told me that she felt that racing against Dr. McKinnon was simply not fair. Dr. McKinnon stands six feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Fader, by contrast, is 5-foot-5 and weighs 135 pounds. So minutes before the finals were set to start, she pulled out of the competition entirely. \u201cI thought that doing it this way was my own form of protest,\u201d Fader said. \u201cI knew that I personally did not agree with the situation. I don\u2019t want to compete in a sport where the rules are unfair.\u201d\n\nAdditional women cyclists erased their voices, said the VeloNews article:\n\nOther female competitors shared her opinion, Fader said, however, they were scared to speak out publicly against Dr. McKinnon. These riders feared being labeled discriminatory and insensitive, and thus kept their opinions to themselves. Indeed, one other rider from the race reached out to me to share a similar opinion to Fader\u2019s. This rider wished to remain anonymous.\n\nMcKinnon \u201crobbed those women of their honors,\u201d said Cretella. \u201cThat is one example of a transgender man \u2026 This is what happens when \u2018gender identity\u2019 takes the place of sex \u2014 women lose, women are erased.\u201d\n\nMcKinnon declined to answer questions from Breitbart News:\n\nLOL. No Breitbart, I don't want to talk to you. pic.twitter.com/IM6zm5XPsS \u2014 Dr. Rachel McKinnon (@rachelvmckinnon) October 26, 2018\n\nAmid criticism by left-wing and right-wing female critics, McKinnon dismissed female critics as \u201cTERFS and \u201cFARTS\u201d:\n\nFeminism-appropriating reactionary transphobes (FARTs, previously known as TERFs) are the ones who don't understand biology, reality, and science. They still believe in Grade 5 (or maybe undergrad) Biology 'facts' that are actually false I wrote a book on these kinds of lies! \u2014 Dr. Rachel McKinnon (@rachelvmckinnon) October 24, 2018\n\nMcKinnon called his female critics \u201cFARTS,\u201d for \u201cfeminism-appropriating reactionary transphobes.\u201d The insult implies that his female critics are not women.\n\n\u201cTERF\u201d is the dismissive slur used by transgender advocates towards the feminists who recognize that biology defines the complementary distinctions between men and women. TERF stands for \u201cTrans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists.\u201d\n\nMcKinnon argues that biology is \u201csocially constructed\u201d and so can be rewritten to show that some males really are females:\n\nBody parts are neither 'male' nor 'female.' A penis is not 'male.' There are females that have them. A vagina is not 'female.' There are males that have them. Use your words, kids. If you want to talk about a body part, use its proper name. Don't resort to 'male genitals.' \u2014 Dr. Rachel McKinnon (@rachelvmckinnon) October 24, 2018\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s comment about sexual organs reflects the reality that few of the few people who describe themselves as Transgender undergo traumatic genital cosmetic surgery. Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.\n\nDespite McKinnon\u2019s example of female erasure \u2014 and many other examples in sports \u2014 transgender activists are now charging Trump with trying to \u201cerase\u201d people who want to live as members of the opposite sex.\n\nSetting a destructive precedent, the Trump-Pence administration intends to erase LGBTQ people from federal civil rights protections and eviscerate enforcement of non-discrimination laws. We #WontBeErased. pic.twitter.com/Accpnff8xL \u2014 Human Rights Campaign (@HRC) October 25, 2018\n\nBut that \u201cerase\u201d phrase was taken from two-sex feminists who have long argued that the transgender ideology wants to erase the biological definition of women, said Cretella. \u201cThey are pirating the language.\u201d\n\nBut McKinnon insists that the government\u2019s rejection of the \u201cgender identity\u2019 definition for \u201csex\u201d will leave him and other people without protection. In an op-ed for the Washington Post, McKinnon said:\n\nWe can be evicted for being trans. We can be fired for being trans. We can be denied health care for being trans. Do you think that\u2019s fair? Do you think that\u2019s what America is about? I don\u2019t know what to say to you if you disagree with basic tenets of human decency. We will not be erased.\n\nBut people are either women and men, Cretella said, so \u201ctransgender people had human rights before Obama pulled his underhanded tactic of extending [sex discrimination law] to include a person\u2019s \u2018Gender Identity.'\u201d\n\nThe \u201ctransgender erasure\u201d claim, said Cretella, \u201cis complete and utter nonsense, it is absolutely ludicrous.\u201d\n\nThe transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology\u2019s claim that a person\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology.\n\nThe transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have different goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists, progressives, feminists who wish to blur distinctions between the two sexes and people who glamorize the distinctions between the two sexes. It includes high-profile children, people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex and people trying to \u201cdetransition\u201d back to their sex, men who say they are lesbians, masculine autogynephiles, wealthy donors, politicians, political professionals, and medical service providers.\n\nDespite the growing damage to young people \u2014 including people who give up their claim to be \u201ctransgender\u201d and reclaim their sex \u2014 the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male.\n\nThe progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules which help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different and equal men and women.\n\nThese pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents\u2019 rights in childrearing, children\u2019s safety, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women\u2019s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men\u2019s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, military culture, and children\u2019s sexual privacy.", "Actors Chris Rock and Keegan-Michael Key star in a get out the vote ad claiming that black voters are being \u201cdisenfranchised.\u201d The stars offer black voters advice on what to do if they are turned away at their polling place.\n\nThe two are pushing the alarm button with the claim that black people are being prevented from voting in the November 6 midterm elections.\n\nKey exclaims without presenting any proof, \u201cThere are efforts underway across America right now to keep certain groups from voting.\u201d Chris Rock interjects screaming \u201cgroups?\u201d causing Key to say that he means black people are being prevented from voting.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t tell you you can\u2019t vote,\u201d Key yells at the camera. \u201cYou have a right to ask for a provisional ballot.\n\nThe pair ends the spot saying in unison that blacks should tell poll workers, \u201cGive me a provisional ballot with a receipt as required by law when requested.\u201d\n\nThe last message on the screen is \u201cDon\u2019t let them silence you.\u201d\n\nWatch @KeeganMKey and @chrisrock explain what to do if someone tries to stop you from voting (with @ColorofChange) pic.twitter.com/kGka11kOci \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) November 2, 2018\n\nThe Now This ad was created for the far-left advocacy group Color of Change.\n\nEven though the pair claim that voter suppression is occurring \u201cacross America right now,\u201d the ad is presumably in response to efforts in Georgia to correct the voter rolls by eliminating thousands of improper voter registrations.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Republican Secretary of State\u2019s office has set about to dump over 50,000 names from the voter rolls. Most of the names are those of people who have passed away, people who moved out of state, or people who are registered in more than one district. But liberals claim that the culling hits black voters harder than others and that it is an attempt to prevent black people from voting.\n\nNo one is being prevented from voting, even if their name does not appear on a registration list.\n\nMany of the disputed registrations are a result of mismatched information \u2014 such as names on driver\u2019s licenses spelled differently than names on voter rolls. And by law, this discrepancy is up to the voter to clear up, not the state.\n\nHundreds of these mismatched registrations were provided by liberal activist groups in past elections. One left-wing group, New Georgia Project, for instance, supplied thousands of likely fraudulent registrations in 2014 and an investigation put many of these registrations on hold. So, many of the pulled registrations these liberal groups say are evidence of voter suppression are really incomplete, misspelled, or fraudulent registrations. Indeed, according to the state, 14 percent of the rejected registrations come from this 2014 campaign.\n\nFinally, others on the list were purged because the person had not bothered to vote in the last few election cycles. Advocacy groups say this criteria is racist.\n\nContrary to the loud proclamations by Chris Rock and Keegan Michael Key, the actual evidence appears to show that there has been no effort to suppress the black vote in Georgia.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "Model and left-wing political activist Emily Ratajkowski declared Friday that \u201cfeminism is great for everyone\u201d and said that the United States has an \u201cinsane problem\u201d with police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to accept men,\u201d Emily Ratajkowski said at the \u201cPower Women Summit\u201d held by The Wrap.\n\n\u201cMaybe they need to let us be the main voices, but I\u2019m happy for them to show up and be a part of this conversation because it\u2019s impacting them as well.

(Click here to see place and time for our Washington, DC, 2018 memorial.) But as hard as we tried, the media would give us little or no coverage, instead choosing to focus massive amounts of biased footage and news coverage sympathetic to the plight of illegal aliens, falsely characterizing illegals as people like us, \u201cjust wanting a better life.\u201d But there is an insidious twist to their lies. It\u2019s all happening at our expense!\n\nSince 2009, The Remembrance Project has honored and remembered Americans killed by illegal aliens through our Stolen Lives Quilt by touring the country, in sponsoring many live events, and, most recently, through almost-daily appearances in television or radio interviews. While there are no reliable statistics on illegal alien killings of Americans, there are thousands of real stories of real Americans killed, documented in police reports, the Internet, nightly television news, and on our Stolen Lives Quilt:\n\nBut Congress has intentionally turned a blind eye to this terrible epidemic-sized crime wave crossing the border. They have ignored not only the killings of Americans, but also the thousands of rapes, molestations, and the unprecedented sexual enslavement of young girls and boys over decades of unfettered illegal migration. Millions more of American lives have been lost as the direct result of massive amounts of drugs coming into our communities and into our schools each year.\n\n\u201cNo worries!\u201d says Congress. They want you to know that they are working\u2026but their dirty little secret? (Answer: They\u2019re not working for you.) Thus far, the D.C. swamp masters of deceit have intentionally introduced over 18 thousand bills, resolutions, and amendments in fewer than 340 days in session, knowing that only a handful will ever reach the president\u2019s desk, or even see a single vote!\n\nA cursory look through the current list of resolutions introduced by Congress reveals some very perverse efforts by the House and Senate to promote illegal aliens and other non-American groups over Americans. Below are just 4 of the 2,217 proposed resolutions, most of which are monumental chest-puffing and deceptive braggadocio for their constituent newsletters and emails:\n\nHouse Resolution, H.Res.492 : \u201cExpressing concern for the separation of Jos\u00e9 Escobar from his wife and children as a result of his deportation, and for other purposes.\u201d This bill is just one of many anti-Trump bills and resolutions that Democrats have introduced since Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. House Resolution, H.Res.869 : \u201cRecognizing American Muslims\u2019 history and contributions to our Nation.\u201d But no mention of the horrific crimes committed by members of that same group against Americans. Senate Resolution, S.Res.566 : \u201cA resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the President of the United States must immediately establish an interagency Office for Locating and Reuniting Children with Parents in order to protect separated children from suffering additional trauma resulting from the \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 policy.\u201d Clearly, an anti-Trump message, and especially insensitive to American families insofar as there is no resolution in the Senate setting aside even one day to honor Americans killed, who are permanently separated from their families , by illegal aliens released into the United States. While they feel a need to openly defy the president\u2019s lawful ban, where is the day of remembrance for Americans killed by illegal aliens, many killed by members of the group that Congress now wishes to honor? Senate Resolution, S.Res.388 : \u201cA resolution recognizing January 27, 2018, as the anniversary of the first refugee and Muslim ban, and urging the President to demonstrate true leadership on refugee resettlement.\u201dWhile they feel a need to openly defy the president\u2019s lawful ban, where is the day of remembrance for Americans killed by illegal aliens, many killed by members of the group that Congress now wishes to honor?\n\n\n\nWith Congress preoccupied in honoring and remembering illegal aliens and citizens of foreign countries, I penned a September 6, 2018, letter to someone who actually cares\u2013President Trump\u2013saying, in part:\n\nMr. President, an official proclamation by you would solidify what we could not do during the Obama years, that is, having the President set aside one day each year to publicly honor these \u201cStolen Lives\u201d who are permanently separated from their families through no fault of their own. We firmly believe that one official commemorative day will give added, continued public exposure of this epidemic of killings, and will move the support for the wall, and other needed measures, substantially in the right direction.\n\nAll of us\u2013the Angel moms; dads; wives and husbands; children; and friends of loved ones whose lives have been so unfairly stolen\u2013are tremendously hopeful that the president will once again hear us. What greater message can our wonderful president give to grieving American families than to proclaim a National Day of Remembrance for Americans Killed by Illegal Aliens?\n\nClick here to read The Remembrance Project\u2019s letter to President Trump.\n\nMaria Espinoza is the national director of The Remembrance Project, a non-profit, dedicated to protecting America and honoring the memory of those killed by illegal aliens.

Estero is a suburb city of Fort Myers, Florida. Some Trump supporters watched the rally outside the arena on a video screen.\n\nObama rallied for Florida Democrat Senator Bill Nelson and the Democratic candidate for governor Andrew Gillum. The former president said he was happy to go to Miami to enjoy the warm weather, but that there were a lot of good reasons to come to Florida.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the ocean, you\u2019ve got really good Cuban sandwiches,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got very nice looking people.\u201d\n\nObama was interrupted by protesting hecklers at least four different times at his rally.\n\n\u201cIt tells you something interesting that even the folks who are in charge are still mad,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re getting ginned up to be mad. That\u2019s the mindset.\u201d\n\nTrump campaigned against the media during his rally, berating them for continued negative coverage of his presidency.\n\n\u201cThe far-left media has spread terrible lies and stories about the Trump administration and the tens of millions of people who make up our great movement, the greatest political movement in the history of our country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also acknowledged the hurricane that hit the Florida Panhandle in October, vowing to work to restore the community.\n\n\u201cTogether we will ensure that Florida comes back stronger than ever,\u201d he said.", "Imagine living in a world where a few executives in Silicon Valley, along with a couple of credit card companies, get to control what you say, who you interact with, what causes you can support, whose products you can buy and whether you can run a business.\n\nPolitical domination by Silicon Valley and progressive corporations likely outcome if Republican voters don\u2019t turn out in sufficient numbers this Tuesday.\n\nAmerica has already caught a glimpse of the coming corporate dystopia. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve seen a massive, largely unchecked assault on Americans\u2019 ability to enjoy their constitutional freedoms, led by unaccountable CEOs and relentlessly encouraged by Democrats and the establishment media.\n\nThe most striking example of this undemocratic collusion between political factions and corporations was the mass-ban of Alex Jones and Infowars. Love him or loathe him, Jones was the most censored man in media this year, facing permanent bans from Apple podcasts, Apple\u2019s App Store, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, LinkedIn, Vimeo, Mailchimp, and even Pinterest. The mass purge followed weeks of lobbying by CNN for Silicon Valley to take action.\n\nOther conservative figures who have been blacklisted by big tech this year include CRTV host Gavin McInnes (on both Twitter and Facebook), Islam critic Tommy Robinson, Republican organizer R.C. Maxwell, and former adviser to President Nixon, Roger Stone.\n\nMeanwhile, far-left extremists like the notorious racist and recent New York Times hire Sarah Jeong are given privileged treatment by social media companies. Despite engaging in hate speech that would get a conservative banned in minutes, Jeong was verified by Twitter, guaranteeing that her tweets will be promoted in the influential platform\u2019s algorithm. Also verified \u2014 Sleeping Giants, a group whose sole purpose is to spread misinformation and slander about conservative news publications to their advertisers.\n\nSocial media companies don\u2019t have to ban any kind of lawful speech. They could easily devolve that power to users via opt-in filters. But even as the platforms have become modern public squares \u2014 essential arenas for Americans to exercise their First Amendment rights \u2014 they have developed a ceaselessly expanding list of rules, regulations, and prohibitions on lawful speech.\n\nThe social media platforms and their allies in the Democrat-corporate media complex avoid public use of the word \u201ccensorship\u201d to describe these policies. Democrats go so far as to call it a conspiracy theory. But thanks to a leaked internal briefing from Google, we know that big tech privately admits what we all know to be true \u2014 that a few companies now control the majority of online speech, and that they\u2019ve shifted towards censorship.\n\nBeyond social media censorship, conservatives are being choked off financially. Under pressure from Mastercard and the far-left SPLC, the online donations site Patreon cut off support to Islam critic Robert Spencer earlier this year. Because the pressure comes from the banks and credit card companies at the very top of the financial food chain, it\u2019s also impossible to simply set up a free-speech oriented competitor to Patreon \u2014 attempts to do so, in the form of FreeStartr and MakerSupport, were effectively ended when the online payment processors Stripe and PayPal withdrew their services.\n\nThanks to the crackdown from credit cards and payment processors, the right are now finding it increasingly difficult to fundraise for their political causes online. And thanks to the bans on social media platforms, they can\u2019t mobilize their supporters online either. This is unprecedented election interference, far beyond the wildest Democrat conspiracy theory about Russia.\n\nEven the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization with a left-leaning culture, is concerned. Here\u2019s what an EFF spokeswoman told Breitbart News earlier this year:\n\nEFF is deeply concerned that payment processors are making choices about which websites can and can\u2019t accept payments or process donations. This can have a huge impact on what types of speech are allowed to flourish online. We\u2019ve seen examples \u2014 such as when WikiLeaks faced a banking blockade \u2014 of payment processors and other financial institutions shutting down the accounts of websites engaged in legal but unpopular speech. I\u2019m deeply concerned that we\u2019re letting banks and payment processors turn into de facto Internet censors.\n\nIt\u2019s not just political speech and fundraising, though. If you run a business that progressives find objectionable, corporate America will come for you too.\n\nDriven by opportunistic progressive hysteria following school shootings, Bank of America and Citigroup launched an unprecedented assault on the Second Amendment earlier this year. Citigroup, the fourth-largest bank in the U.S., announced in March that it would sever its relationships with gun stores that did not adhere to a number of gun control policies demanded by progressive activists, including a ban on bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Bank of America followed suit later in the year, while Stripe now refuses to process payments for gun makers.\n\nThe corporate assault on the Second Amendment has plunged the National Rifle Association (NRA) into a financial crisis. The nonprofit has filed a lawsuit against New York governor Andrew Cuomo for encouraging the corporate boycotts of the organization, saying: \u201cIf the NRA is unable to collect donations from its members, safeguard the assets endowed to it, apply its funds to cover media buys and other expenses integral to its political speech, and obtain basic corporate insurance coverage, it will be unable to exist as a not-for-profit or pursue its advocacy mission\n\nNo \u2018Free Market\u2019 Solution\n\nThis corporate coup represents a new kind of constitutional crisis for America. What good is the First Amendment or the Second Amendment if the services that Americans rely on to conduct their day-to-day activities use their power to make those rights meaningless?\n\nIt\u2019s like equal rights for African-Americans in the Jim Crow south. On paper, they had them. In practice, they did not.\n\nThere is no free-market fix to this problem, unless you think building a competitor to Mastercard and Visa is a viable option, or that Google, Facebook Apple, YouTube and Twitter will lose their dominant positions in the market overnight.\n\nAnd even if that were possible, who\u2019s to say that their replacements won\u2019t become just as authoritarian in their policies?\n\nYou cannot overcome the incentives. Mega-corporations face pressure from within; inherently left-leaning HR departments and metropolitan liberal employees. They also face pressure from without: Democrat lawmakers, relentless and well-funded leftwing activists, and of course legacy media like CNN.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not counting the fact that CEOs in Silicon Valley lean left, while the heads of major banks are globalist-liberal almost by definition.\n\nNone of these companies will voluntarily flip to a pro-liberty position. If they did, they would face immediate pressure campaign from politicians, media outlets, activists, commercial partners, and their own employees. Even if they wanted to \u2014 and most don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s simply not worth it.\n\nJust as legislation fixed the erosion of African-Americans\u2019 constitutional rights under Jim Crow, only legislation will fix the new corporate tyranny. But it\u2019ll never happen if Democrats, who are both the allies and ideological leaders of this corporate coup, take control of either the House or Senate in a few days. If Republican voters don\u2019t like being ruled by Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and a handful of other CEOs, they must turn out on Tuesday.\n\nAllum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

As Trump made his decision to run in the 2016 election, he was told of the importance of Knight\u2019s endorsement in Indiana. He recalled what he deemed a gift from God, lifting up one of several stacks of paper on his desk and coming right across the index card with Knight\u2019s phone number. He said he called Knight, who said he had been waiting for Trump\u2019s call.\n\nPresident Trump recounted Coach Knight\u2019s litany of basketball achievements, including his induction into the Hall of Fame in 1991, his record as the last coach to have an undefeated season for the Indiana Hoosiers, coaching the team to several NCAA titles, and coaching the USA Men\u2019s Basketball Team to Olympic gold.\n\nTrump urged rally attendees and watchers to get out and vote for Republican Senate candidate Mike Braun and a Republican Congress.

Kirsten Gillibrand, to return or donate to charity over $806,000 that Gillibrand received from a law firm headed by Harvey Weinstein\u2019s long-time attorney, close adviser and business investor.\n\n\u201cShe needs to return that money,\u201d Farley told this reporter in an interview. \u201cOtherwise she can\u2019t call herself the #MeToo senator.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs she the #MeToo senator? No, I think she is the #MeFirst senator.\u201d\n\nIn August, Breitbart News reported that Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, the law firm headed by famed attorney David Boies, has been Gillibrand\u2019s single largest campaign donor throughout her political career and at the time was the second-largest donor in the 2018 election cycle. The law firm has since become her top donor this election cycle, according to the most recent public election data.\n\nBoies himself was widely criticized over controversial tactics he reportedly deployed to minimize the allegations of sexual assault and harassment faced by Weinstein. Gillibrand\u2019s continued acceptance of financial support from Boies\u2019s firm comes despite her being one of the most prominent and outspoken supporters of the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u201cGillibrand returned the money she got from Harvey Weinstein, yet she is not donating this $800,000 to a sexual abuse charity, as I have been calling her out for for months,\u201d Farley stated.\n\nFayley was referring to Gillibrand\u2019s very public decision to donate the $11,800 in campaign contributions she received directly from Weinstein to RAINN, a nonprofit tending to victims of sexual assault. This while she continues to accept contributions from Boies Schiller Flexner.\n\nBoies helped Weinstein settle a sexual harassment claim and reportedly personally signed a contract with a shadowy private investigation company that engaged in efforts to foil the extensive New York Times investigation into the accusations against Weinstein. Those efforts reportedly included an operative going so far as to pose as a women\u2019s rights activist to glean information from one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers. An operative from the firm hired by Boies also reportedly went undercover to meet with reporters in an effort to get the names of female accusers speaking to the news media about Weinstein.\n\nGillibrand positioned herself as a leading #MeToo advocate in December 2017, when she became the first senator to demand that Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) step down after a photo surfaced that appeared to show then-comedian Franken engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct years before he ran for public office. She also sent shockwaves across the Democratic political arena when she commented that Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\nOpenSecrets.org, the respected campaign finance tracker run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, documents that Gillibrand\u2019s top donor throughout her political career has been the Boies Schiller Flexner law firm. The firm has provided Gillibrand with a total of $806,983 since 2005, according to data released electronically by the Federal Election Commission.\n\nA breakdown by election cycle finds that Boies Schiller Flexner was her top donor in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 and now in 2018, as well.\n\nGillibrand has a personal history with the firm. She worked there as a partner from 2001 until November 2006, when she was elected to New York\u2019s 20th Congressional District.\n\nWhen she was first elected to Congress, Boies Schiller Flexner issued a press release touting its \u201csubstantial support\u201d for her New York campaign.\n\nBoies Schiller Flexner has long been led by co-founder David Boies, considered one of the most powerful attorneys in America.\n\nA Bloomberg profile characterized Boies\u2019 work thusly: \u201cFor decades, Boies has been cleaning up his wealthy clientele\u2019s messes. More quietly, he\u2019s been cleaning up his own.\u201d\n\nBloomberg continued, citing questions about Boies\u2019 judgement and claims about \u201cmoral outrage\u201d:\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen people who\u2019ve worked with him show that this isn\u2019t the first time his loyalty to a friend or client has tested the bounds of propriety and called his judgment into question. \u201cI probably do tend to stay with friends and clients more than some other people would,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes that can subject me to criticism.\u201d Boies survived those episodes with his aura intact. Inside the firm\u2019s offices, he and his lieutenants expect nothing different this time around. They\u2019re sure they\u2019ll outlast the current wave of moral outrage \u2014 and even imagine themselves on the right side of history.\n\nThe profile revolved around the law firm\u2019s defense of its now former client Harvey Weinstein and Boies\u2019s own close personal and financial relationship with the fallen Hollywood big shot. Besides the firm\u2019s representation of the movie mogul, Boies himself has done business with Weinstein, was regularly seen in Weinstein\u2019s social orbit and was described by the New York Times as a \u201ctrusted adviser to Mr. Weinstein.\u201d\n\nA widely cited New Yorker piece penned by Ronan Farrow first broke the story that Boies inked a deal with Black Cube, described as a private investigation outfit founded by former Israeli intelligence analysts, in an attempt to stop the Times\u2019 investigation into Weinstein, with an operative of Black Cube reportedly pretending to be a woman\u2019s rights activist while trying to gather information from one of Weinstein\u2019s female accusers. A Black Cube agent also met with reporters undercover to divine the names of those women who were secretly speaking to the news media about Weinstein, the New Yorker reported.\n\nBoies\u2019s actions took place while Boies Schiller Flexner was separately representing the New York Times, including in a libel case.\n\nFarrow, writing at the New Yorker, reported:\n\nTwo private investigators from Black Cube, using false identities, met with the actress Rose McGowan, who eventually publicly accused Weinstein of rape, to extract information from her. One of the investigators pretended to be a women\u2019s-rights advocate and secretly recorded at least four meetings with McGowan. The same operative, using a different false identity and implying that she had an allegation against Weinstein, met twice with a journalist to find out which women were talking to the press. In other cases, journalists directed by Weinstein or the private investigators interviewed women and reported back the details.\n\nBoies personally signed the contract with Black Cube, according to the New Yorker, with the attorney admitting that the opposition information gathered from one private investigation firm was funneled through him to Weinstein:\n\nBoies confirmed that his firm contracted with and paid two of the agencies and that investigators from one of them sent him reports, which were then passed on to Weinstein. He said that he did not select the firms or direct the investigators\u2019 work. \u2026 On October 28, 2016, Boies\u2019s law firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, wired to Black Cube the first hundred thousand dollars, toward what would ultimately be a six-hundred-thousand-dollar invoice. (The documents do not make clear how much of the invoice was paid.) The law firm and Black Cube signed a contract that month and several others later. One, dated July 11, 2017, and bearing Boies\u2019s signature, states that the project\u2019s \u201cprimary objectives\u201d are to \u201cprovide intelligence which will help the Client\u2019s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper\u201d and to \u201cobtain additional content of a book which currently being written and includes harmful negative information on and about the Client,\u201d who is identified as Weinstein in multiple documents.\n\nAfter the New Yorker broke the story, Boies characterized his involvement with Black Cube as a mistake. \u201cWe should not have been contracting with and paying investigators that we did not select and direct,\u201d he conceded. \u201cAt the time, it seemed a reasonable accommodation for a client, but it was not thought through, and that was my mistake. It was a mistake at the time.\u201d\n\nBoies\u2019s actions drew sharp criticism and did not sit well with the firm\u2019s other client. The New York Times fired Boies\u2019s firm over the matter and called the famed attorney\u2019s conduct in the affair, which included an attempt to stop the Times\u2019 own reporting, a \u201cgrave betrayal of trust.\u201d\n\nAn op-ed published in the New York Times by Stanford law professor Deborah L. Rhode lobbed ethics accusations at Boies:\n\nMr. Boies responded in a public statement that his firm had a clause in its retainer agreement with The Times that purported to waive all conflicts of interest on matters unrelated to cases in which the newspaper had retained the firm. But as The Times\u2019s leadership pointed out in its own statement, it never contemplated that the firm would contract with investigators to do opposition research on its own reporters. Unsurprisingly, The Times considered this conduct to be a \u201cgrave betrayal of trust,\u201d and grounds to terminate the firm. It is hard to imagine how a lawyer of Mr. Boies\u2019s caliber would not have anticipated this reaction. It gets worse. Bar ethical rules prohibit lawyers not only from engaging in fraud, deceit or misrepresentation, but also from inducing others to do so. They also specifically forbid lawyers from directing non-lawyers to engage in prohibited conduct. Black Cube employees were in fact involved in such deceit; investigators misrepresented their identities in order to gain confidences from women whom Mr. Weinstein had harassed or assaulted. Although Mr. Boies now claims that he had no knowledge of such practices, he surely was in a position to have such knowledge and had reason to suspect them. He had hired an organization known for hardball tactics and reportedly received reports of their findings.\n\nWeinstein accuser Rose McGowan called Boies a \u201cscumbag\u201d over his role in hiring Black Cube.\n\nBesides hiring a firm to try to allegedly stop the Weinstein accusations from going public, Boies also helped Weinstein reach a settlement with one alleged victim of the movie mogul. Former Weinstein Company employee Lauren O\u2019Connor authored a 2015 memo in which she detailed allegations of sexual harassment and complained that she was afraid to travel with Weinstein, leading Boies to help Weinstein settle with O\u2019Connor.\n\nO\u2019Connor told the New York Times that she believes the settlement was a way of attempting to make her accusations disappear after she persisted with the charges. \u201cThe first time I spoke out, the message from H.R. was, \u2018This is not our problem,\u2019\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cThe second time I spoke up the response was, \u2018How can we quickly make this go away?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoies is more deeply tied to Weinstein. The lawyer reportedly met Weinstein in 2001 and discussed the possibility of writing a memoir for Weinstein\u2019s imprint Miramax Books. The memoir, Courting Justice, was published by Weinstein\u2019s company in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Boies helped Weinstein and his brother Bob separate from the Walt Disney Co. He also provided counsel for the Weinsteins after they first formed the Weinstein Co.\n\nThe relationship extended well beyond legal advice. Weinstein and Boies co-hosted a private screening in New York for liberal activist Michael Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11. The two were seen together having dinner with Hillary Clinton days after her loss against Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential primaries and immediately thereafter Clinton began discussions with Weinstein regarding a TV documentary about her presidential bid. Weinstein was on the invite list for Boies\u2019s 75th birthday bash held at the Wynn Las Vegas in 2016.\n\nBoies\u2019s daughter Mary Regency got one of her first acting credits for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, a film produced in 2012 by the Weinstein Co. Weinstein also acquired the U.S. rights to a Western that was to be executive produced by Boies and produced by his daughter via the Boies/Schiller Film Group, which was formed by Boies and the son of his legal partner, Jonathan Schiller. Boies also reportedly invested a total of $10 million in two Weinstein Co. movies.\n\nBoies finally dropped Weinstein as a client in early November 2017.\n\nSpeaking to Ronan Farrow, Boies admitted that he had seen enough red flags that should have alerted him to Weinstein\u2019s treatment of women. \u201cAlthough he vigorously denies using physical force, Mr. Weinstein has himself recognized that his contact with women was indefensible and incredibly hurtful,\u201d Boies said.\n\nBoies added: \u201cIn retrospect, I knew enough in 2015 that I believe I should have been on notice of a problem, and done something about it. I don\u2019t know what, if anything, happened after 2015, but to the extent it did, I think I have some responsibility. I also think that if people had taken action earlier it would have been better for Mr. Weinstein.\u201d\n\nBoies Schiller Flexner has faced accusations of its own related to gender discrimination.\n\nBloomberg reported:\n\nIn 2002, Rachel Baird, a former Boies Schiller Flexner attorney, along with a colleague, sued the firm for gender discrimination. In one incident, Baird describes Boies telling her, the only female attorney in the room, to go downstairs and pay for his cab. At the time, the firm said the claims were without merit; eventually, the women settled for $37,500 each. Marguerite Hogan, an associate who left the same year as Gilbert, says: \u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of women for me to look up to. When you\u2019re in that situation and there is nobody else around you that\u2019s like you, it can feel a little isolating.\u201d\n\nAround 2005, three attendees reportedly recalled going on the law firm\u2019s weekend retreat in Jamaica, where attorneys were, as Bloomberg described it, greeted \u201cat an evening reception by a woman splayed out on a buffet table with her body covered in chocolate.\u201d Gillibrand was working with at Boies Schiller Flexner at the time, although her campaign did not reply to a Breitbart News question about whether she attended the Jamaica event.\n\nThe firm\u2019s general counsel Nick Gravante Jr. said that Boies\u2019s wife Mary, who is also an attorney at the firm, was not amused by the woman on display at the Jamaica event. \u201cMary right away directed that the woman get off the table,\u201d recalled Gravante, who blamed the hotel for the episode.\n\nFollowing the negative publicity about his ties to Weinstein, Boies\u2019s law firm upped the number of attorneys on its executive committee from seven to 11, while Boies was reelected chairman last December.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Outside North America, the story about Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, is doing even worse, with just $37 million.\n\nWith a $60 million production budget and somewhere between $30 and $50 million spent on publicity (a reasonable guess), after exhibitors take their 50 percent (an industry accepted formula), this Ryan Gosling film would have to gross something close to $200 million just to break even.\n\nFirst Man is not going to reach $100 million worldwide.\n\nEarly predictions had First Man opening with $20 to $25 million.

Federal agencies reported that drug cartels in Mexico continue to be the wholesale sources of drugs for street gangs that in turn push narcotics at the local level.\n\nThe finding comes in the 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment just released by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). During the past 10 years, the drug landscape has changed with the dramatic increase of opioids, the DEA report stated. The agency claims that drug poisoning deaths typically tied to overdose or to emerging drugs like fentanyl are spiking. In 2016, approximately 174 people died every day from drug poisoning. These deaths outnumber those caused by firearms, motor vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide. The agency reported that the U.S. opioid threat \u2014 including controlled prescription drugs, fentanyl, and other synthetic opioids, and heroin \u2014 has had a devastating effect.\n\nThe DEA identifies the Sinaloa Cartel, Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas, Beltran Leyva, and the Juarez Cartel as the criminal organizations responsible for flooding U.S. streets with narcotics. Mexican drug cartels are listed as having deep connections with Colombian drug cartels and with U.S.-based street gangs leading to an established distribution line.\n\nSinaloa Cartel \u2014 One of the oldest and more established criminal organizations. The Sinaloa Cartel is considered to still be the one with the largest footprint in the U.S. The criminal organization has established routes into Phoenix, Los Angeles, Denver, and Chicago. The cartel\u2019s drugs are primarily pushed across the Mexican border with California, Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas.\n\nCartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) \u2014 Considered to be the newest of the six main drug cartels, their rapid expansion is characterized by their willingness to engage in violent confrontations with Mexican Government security forces and rival cartels. The drug cartel operates in the border cities of Tijuana, Juarez, and Nuevo Laredo and has distribution hubs in the U.S. cities of Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Atlanta.\n\nJuarez Cartel \u2014 Based out of the Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, the criminal organization operates primarily through West Texas and New Mexico. Its drug distributions hubs include El Paso, Denver, Chicago, and Oklahoma City. A turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa Cartels is to blame for the 2010 spike in murders in that city.\n\nGulf Cartel \u2014 Another of the older cartels in Mexico, this criminal organization operates primarily out of South Texas and moves marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine to Houston, Detroit, and Atlanta. In South Texas, the Gulf Cartel coordinates with local gangs to not only handle local distribution but also carry to out attacks and assassinations against targets throughout the nation, the DEA revealed.\n\nLos Zetas \u2014 An offshoot of the Gulf Cartel, the criminal organization crosses their drugs through the states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas to deliver them to Laredo, Dallas, New Orleans, and Atlanta. The cartel underwent a series of schisms that led to the criminal organization\u2019s diminished influence but it still maintains busy smuggling corridors. According to the DEA, Los Zetas have lost much of their power in recent years with the cartel splintering into two rival factions \u2013 the Northeast Cartel (Cartel del Noreste, or CDN), representing a rebranded form of mainstream Zetas, and the Old School Zetas (Vieja Escuela or VE), which is a breakaway group.\n\nBeltran Leyva Cartel \u2014 Another offshoot of the Sinaloa Cartel, the criminal organization operates in the Mexican states of Guerrero, Morelos, Nayarit, and Sinaloa and has working relationships with Juarez, Los Zetas, and CJNG to access smuggling corridors. The BLO runs distribution hubs in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta.", "HIDALGO, Texas \u2013 U.S. military forces placed barriers and concertina wire and carried out drills on the international bridge that divides this border city from Reynosa, Mexico. The efforts appear to be preparations for thousands of Central American caravan migrants who are expected to arrive at one of the various ports of entry.\n\nThis week, military troops arrived in the Rio Grande Valley as part of the expected deployment of more than 5,000 soldiers throughout the U.S.-Mexico border in response to the migrant caravan. While official information was not readily available, dozens of soldiers in military fatigues could be seen reinforcing parts of the Hidalgo-Reynosa port of entry \u2014 one of several international bridges in the area.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported late last month, thousands of migrants left from Honduras in the first of several caravans that have publicly claimed that their goal is the U.S border. The Mexican government started a program that would provide temporary employment, healthcare, and education to those migrants who agreed to stay in the southern part of Mexico and follow immigration law. H, leaders of the caravan publicly turned down the offer.\n\nThe caravans sparked controversy after some of their members took part in violent clashes with Mexican federal authorities at the border between Mexico and Guatemala. Videos of the clashes drew worldwide attention and the Mexican government publicly announced that some of the migrants had used and were preparing to use Molotov cocktails and firearms against federal police forces.\n\nIldefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

The average price of a new automobile was $2,822.00, and the minimum wage was $1.60 an hour.\n\nJackie Kennedy got married to the Greek shipping billionaire, Aristotle Onassis:\n\nThe NYT\u2019s comparison to the 1960s was caused by the good news in the regular agency report about the October economy. Breitbart News reported:\n\nWage growth, long considered the \u201cmissing ingredient\u201d to the economic expansion, has finally returned. Average hourly earnings climbed by five cents an hour for the month, or 83 cents year-over-year. That represents a 3.1 percent gain, the first time wages have grown more than 3 percent year-over-year.\n\nThe New York Times noted:\n\nThe number of adults not in the labor force at all fell by 487,000. And employers evidently needed to pay higher wages to coax these workers off the sidelines. Long the soft underbelly of this expansion, average hourly earnings are now up 3.1 percent over the last year, from 2.8 percent in the previous reading. Put it together, and this is the best time for the American labor market in at least 18 years and maybe closer to 50.\n\nSince 1973 \u2014 aside from a brief spike in the late 1990s \u2014 wage growth has remained flat, partly because the federal government helps employers by pumping hundreds of thousands of foreign workers into the labor pool each year. In 2016, for example, President Barack Obama brought in 1.75 million immigrants, visa workers, and illegal immigrants to compete for jobs against the four million young Americans who joined the workforce that year. The post-1973 flatline is obvious in this chart released by the U.S. Census Bureau:\n\nBack to the 2018 good news: Trump\u2019s 2018 wage growth is higher for blue-collar employees than for white-collars \u2014 roughly 6.5 percent vs. 4 percent for white-collar. But his wage growth numbers are expected to rise in 2019 as investors are gradually forced to compete for the shrinking pool of unemployed Americans. Of course, companies will happily hire cheaper foreign workers \u2014 legal or illegal \u2014 who enter the United States in 2019.\n\nSo the wage raises may suddenly stop in 2019 if Trump listens to the business and investors groups that are pleading with him to allow more foreign workers, such as the illegals trafficked in the U.S. by the cartels, the Hondurans in the caravan, and the foreign students using the \u201cOptional Practical Training\u201d program.\n\nOne vehicle for their hopes is Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder\u2019s H.R. 392 bill in December, which would import more guest workers and more immigrants. If Trump endorses Yoder\u2019s more-cheap-labor bill this December, investors will know they will never run out of workers \u2014 and will never have to raise wages \u2014 because they can pressure the president to fly more foreign workers into Newark and Los Angeles.\n\nThe New York Times added a caveat to Trump\u2019s go-go economy, saying, \u201cIt would be nice to see sustained wage growth substantially higher than inflation, not just in a single month, before making any comparisons to the boom of the late 1960s.\u201d\n\nTrump has the power to reach for a 1960s repeat and to sustain wage raises right up to his 2020 re-election \u2014 and he also has the power to flatline wages and lose his 2020 re-election. He will show his hand in December.", "Vegetarians and vegans have been getting very uppity of late. One reason for this is that some idiot told them they hold the key to saving the world.\n\nAccording to the (rampantly vego-loon) Humane Society \u201cyour diet could save the planet\u201d.\n\nAccording to Yvo de Boer, the former head of the UN climate agency, \u201cthe best solution would be for us all to become vegetarian.\u201d\n\nAnd according to George Monbiot in the Guardian: \u201cThe best way to save the planet? Drop meat and dairy\u201d.\n\nAll this nonsense has gone to the grass-eaters\u2019 nutritionally-challenged heads. Instead of being a bunch of pale, anaemic, meat-shunning losers who have to keep taking vitamin B12 to stop themselves being blown over every time they go for a walk in their plastic shoes, they have now convinced themselves that they are like Frodo, Neo from the Matrix, Luke Skywalker, and Harry Potter all rolled into one.\n\nWhy do they believe this rubbish?\n\nBecause if you only read the left-wing media, as vegans do, all you ever get to see is hysterical drivel like this (from one of the house eco-loons in the Guardian):\n\nHuge reductions in meat-eating are essential to avoid dangerous climate change, according to the most comprehensive analysis yet of the food system\u2019s impact on the environment. In western countries, beef consumption needs to fall by 90% and be replaced by five times more beans and pulses.\n\nEven formerly conservative newspapers have fallen for this nonsense. According to columnist Bryony Gordon in the Guardiangraph (formerly the Telegraph), the reason \u201cwe\u201d dislike and fear vegans is that we know in our hearts that they are right:\n\nWe know that adopting a vegan lifestyle is better not just for our bodies but also for the planet; we are aware that the harvesting of animals for our convenience could one day kill us all.\n\nI\u2019m trying to envisage a scenario in which \u201cthe harvesting of animals for our convenience\u201d could ever kill us all. Bacon poisoning? Cows and pigs and chickens accidentally breeding with sharks or polar bears and stalking us like clucking, mooing, oinking velociraptors? I don\u2019t know what Bryony is eating right now but whatever it is, it clearly doesn\u2019t involve enough of the meat we all need to stop us from turning into vegetables.\n\nBasically, Bryony and all the other hacks that have bought into this bollocks are being played. Man-made global warming theory is a busted flush so, in order to keep the scam going, the climate industrial complex has been desperately seeking new ways to bolster its Enron-style business model. One of these is to use veggies and vegans as their useful idiots to keep the climate scare going.\n\nIn fact, if we all went veggie or vegan it would make next to no difference to the climate. As Bjorn Lomborg, himself a vegetarian, points out here, the claim is based on cherry-picked data.\n\nAlmost all articles on this topic suggest going vegetarian could achieve emission cuts of 50 percent or more. But these figures are never a reduction of total emissions, just those emitted from food. This is an important distinction because four-fifths of emissions are being ignored. The real impact is five times less. Anyway, a systematic peer review of studies shows vegetarian diets likely reduce an individual\u2019s emissions by the equivalent of 540 kg (1,190 lbs.) of CO2. For the average person in the industrialized world, that\u2019s the equivalent of cutting emissions by just 4.3 percent. Vegetarian diets are also slightly cheaper, and saved money will be spent on goods and services that emit more CO2. A new Swedish study shows a vegetarian diet is 10 percent cheaper, freeing up about 2 percent of an individual\u2019s budget. The extra money would likely be spent proportionally on existing purchases. This boosts one\u2019s carbon emissions by about 2 percent. So eating carrots instead of steak means you effectively cut your emissions by about 2 percent. This won\u2019t save the planet.\n\nLomborg\u2019s article triggered two researchers at Cambridge University, who quibbled with his statistics because, obviously, being at joyless, Cromwellian, tofu-munching Cambridge, they didn\u2019t suit their green narrative.\n\nTo get an idea of where they are coming from, read \u2014 or cringe, rather, at \u2014 this paragraph:\n\nHowever, poorer countries stand to benefit from widescale adoption of a plant-based diet. Mortality linked to strokes, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer could fall by 5m to 6m avoided deaths and trillions of dollars could be saved in healthcare costs and by preventing productivity losses.\n\nHere are two Cambridge PhD students trying to tell us, straightfaced, what they think is best for the poorest, most nutritionally deficient countries in the world, where starvation is a way of life and where meat is almost never an option. More calories, maybe? A bit of animal protein now and again? Nope. What these countries could really benefit from, according to these deluded prigs, is a \u201cplant-based diet.\u201d (Just like they\u2019ve got already whether they like it or not. So that\u2019s handy, isn\u2019t it?)\n\nLomborg explains how they\u2019ve got it wrong in this thread, summed up in this chart:\n\nI\u2019ve been criticized for cherry-picking. Really?\n\nI show going vegetarian cuts 1-9% of emissions, use central 4.3%. Half lost in rebound, so ~2% actual reduction\n\nMy critics say 1-9% should be 1.5-9%.

All but one of those killed were members of the same family, according to a list of the victims\u2019 names released by the church, which said a boy and a girl, ages 15 and 12 respectively, were among the dead.\n\nThe local Islamic State group affiliate, which spearheads militants fighting security forces in the Sinai Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the attack south of Cairo in a statement. It said the attack was revenge for the imprisonment by Egyptian authorities of \u201cour chaste sisters\u201d without elaborating.\n\nThe IS affiliate claimed that 13 Christians were killed and another 18 wounded, but it was not immediately possible to independently verify the claim or reconcile the discrepancy in the number of dead and wounded given by the group and the church.\n\nThe attack was likely to cast a dark shadow on one of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi\u2019s showpieces \u2013 the World Youth Forum \u2013 which opens Saturday in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and hopes to draw thousands of local and foreign youth to discuss upcoming projects, with Egypt\u2019s 63-year-old leader taking center stage.\n\nThe Islamic State has repeatedly vowed to go after Egypt\u2019s Christians as punishment for their support of el-Sissi. As defense minister, el-Sissi led the military\u2019s 2013 ouster of an Islamist president, whose one-year rule proved divisive. It has claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Christians dating back to December 2016.\n\nEl-Sissi, who has made the economy and security his top priorities since taking office in 2014, wrote on his Twitter account that Friday\u2019s attack was designed to harm the \u201cnation\u2019s solid fabric\u201d and pledged to continue fighting terrorism. He later offered his condolences when he spoke by telephone with Pope Tawadros II, spiritual leader of Egypt\u2019s Orthodox Christians and a close el-Sissi ally.\n\nIn a somber message of his own, Tawadros said in a video clip released by the church that the latest attack would only make the Christians stronger.\n\n\u201cI think that this is a terrorist act which is targeting Egypt through playing the card of the Copts,\u201d said Begemy Nassem Nasr, priest of the church of St. Mary in Minya. \u201cWe know that \u2026 President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi is hosting the youth forum and they meant to embarrass him.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s attack is the second to target pilgrims heading to the St. Samuel the Confessor monastery in as many years, indicating that security measures in place since then are either inadequate or have become lax. The previous attack in May 2017 left nearly 30 people dead. It is also the latest by IS to target Christians in churches in Cairo, the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and Tanta in the Nile Delta north of the capital.\n\nThose attacks left at least 100 people dead and led to tighter security around Christian places of worship and Church-linked facilities. They have also underlined the vulnerability of minority Christians in a country where many Muslims have since the 1970s grown religiously conservative.\n\nThe Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, said Friday\u2019s attackers used secondary dirt roads to reach the buses carrying the pilgrims, who were near the monastery at the time of the attack. Only pilgrims have been allowed on the main road leading to the monastery since last year\u2019s attack.\n\nThe Interior Ministry maintained that only one bus was attacked, but the latest statement by the church said three buses were targeted and put the death toll at 7 and the wounded at 19, including two in critical condition.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said police were pursuing the attackers, who fled the scene.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Christians, who account for some 10 percent of the country\u2019s 100 million people, complain of discrimination in the Muslim majority country. Christian activists say the church\u2019s alliance with el-Sissi has offered the ancient community a measure of protection but failed to end frequent acts of discrimination that boil over into violence against Christians, especially in rural Egypt.\n\nIn Minya, the scene of Friday\u2019s attack, Christians constitute the highest percentage of the population \u2013 about 35 percent \u2013 of any Egyptian province. It\u2019s also in Minya where most acts of violence, like attacks on churches and Christian homes and businesses, take place.\n\n___\n\nHendawi reported from Cairo", "NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) \u2013 Voters in New Caledonia are deciding whether the French territory in the South Pacific should break free from the European country that claimed it in the mid-19th century.\n\nA referendum being held on Sunday marks a milestone in the process of the archipelago\u2019s decolonization and will help define New Caledonia\u2019s future as an independent country or as a continuing extension of France.\n\nMore than 174,000 registered voters are invited to answer the question: \u201cDo you want New Caledonia to gain full sovereignty and become independent?\u201d\n\nObservers expect a majority to favor remaining a part of France, based on opinion polls and previous election results.\n\nPolling stations open at 8 a.m. (10 p.m. Saturday in mainland France; 9 p.m. GMT) and close 10 hours later.

New Caledonia receives about 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in French state subsidies every year, and many fear the economy would suffer if ties are severed.\n\nThe referendum is the result of a process that started 30 years ago to end years of violence between supporters and opponents of separating from France.\n\nThe violence, which overall claimed more than 70 lives, prompted a 1988 deal between rival loyalist and pro-independence factions. Another agreement a decade later included plans for an independence referendum.\n\nMost Kanaks have tended to back independence, while most descendants of European settlers have favored keeping the French connection.\n\nTo ensure security during the vote, additional police were sent to New Caledonia. Authorities also banned the carrying of firearms and alcohol sales immediately before and during the vote.\n\nIf voters say no to independence Sunday, the 1998 agreement allows two more self-determination referendums to be held by 2022.", "Women living in a heavily migrant-populated Paris area who complained about constant harassment from men last year are saying the situation has become even worse, with some refusing to even leave their homes.\n\nLast year a group of local women signed a petition in an attempt to call attention to the situation in the Chapelle-Pajol district in northern Paris, but now they claim the situation has become even worse than before, Le Parisien reports.\n\n\u201cThe situation has worsened.

I think when we knew we didn\u2019t want to fully bring him in as the starter, I thought it was a big commitment to make for a guy that I wasn\u2019t sure was going to be the starter and that\u2019s really more what you look at.\u201d\n\nShanahan essentially said the same thing this September after Garrappolo got hurt and some fans and reporters were lobbying for the team to sign Kaepernick.\n\n\u201cI think we made the decision just with our style of offense that we want to go with,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cThat what I said last year and it\u2019s kind of the same [now].\u201d\n\nShanahan runs a version of a system called, \u201cThe West Coast Offense,\u201d a precision passing game that requires the quarterback to make quick decisions and get rid of the ball fast, mainly from the pocket.\n\nKaepernick isn\u2019t known as a great pocket passer.

This is the election.\u201d\n\nRichards and Tester \u2013 both proponents of Obamacare \u2013 told their audience the future of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation could be determined by the midterm elections on Tuesday.\n\nObamacare has benefited Planned Parenthood. In a report by the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives \u2013 which investigated allegations the group profited from the sale of body parts of aborted babies \u2013 the panel noted that during fiscal year 2015, \u201c43% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s revenue derived from \u2018government health services grants & reimbursements,\u2019 at a price tag of $553,700,000.\u201d\n\nThe panel continued:\n\nFurther, while abortion providers are not permitted to receive reimbursement for abortion from Medicaid, former employees of Planned Parenthood have testified that Planned Parenthood would separate out charges for services and products rendered in connection with abortions, such as office visits, ultrasounds, Rh factor tests, lab work, general counseling, and abortion aftercare, and submit those \u201cfragmented\u201d or \u201cunbundled\u201d charges as claims for Medicaid reimbursement.\n\nThe House panel also noted documentation of external reviews of Planned Parenthood affiliates\u2019 financial data, practices and federal audits of state family planning programs, that show the group\u2019s affiliates have overbilled $132.4 million in Medicaid and other healthcare funding programs.\n\nTester said Obamacare may not be perfect, but that the law is increasing access to health care.\n\n\u201cLook there are plenty of problems with the ACA that need to be fixed and need to be fixed in a bipartisan way,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBut just to repeal it and throw all the good things away that that bill did, is a big mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of debates with folks that say, look, my health care rates are too high,\u201d Tester continued. \u201cAnd so this is a problem. We\u2019ve got to figure out ways to help drive it down for everybody, including women.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot once during the roughly 40-minute event did Tester ever say the word \u2018abortion,\u2019 which is among the many health care services provided by Planned Parenthood, but undoubtedly the most politically charged,\u201d said Montana Public Radio.\n\nTester defended Planned Parenthood\u2019s image as a \u201chealth care\u201d provider.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Republican, Independent, Democrat, Libertarian, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, Planned Parenthood offers health care to people. In a rural state like Montana that access is critical. Not unlike community health centers, not unlike small hospitals throughout the state.\u201d\n\nFederally qualified community healthcare centers, however, provide more comprehensive services than Planned Parenthood to low-income families, including prenatal care. Nationally, there are 13,000 FQHCs \u2013 a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities by 20 to 1.

Having that ad, which I thought was just sickening. And frankly, very untrue with regard to the threat that is posed by illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAnd the notion that Democrats have prevented any fix, the last real vote we had on substantial immigration reform was the bipartisan bill we did in 2013. Every Democrat in the Senate voted for that bill, which included about $41 billion for additional border security. That\u2019s more than the president has even asked for on border security. So this notion that this is all the Democrats\u2019 fault is just wrong.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTo see the fear-mongering, particularly with regard to immigration is unseemly.\u201d\n\nOn George Soros, Flake said, \u201cGeorge Soros, with the antisemitism that goes on, we just had an example last week of Radio Mart\u00ed, the broadcast that goes to Cuba. They produced a program that called George Soros a multi-billionaire Jew. And went on to blame him for the financial crisis of 2008. Now, after I wrote a letter and asked for an investigation, they have suspended those who were involved in that program. But that was taxpayer-funded antisemitism and there\u2019s a lot of it that goes on with George Soros, this reference to being a globalist and on and on. And it\u2019s just wrong. It\u2019s just wrong. It shouldn\u2019t go on.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAs you mentioned, he gives a lot of money to progressive and liberal causes. Nobody denies that. He certainly wouldn\u2019t.

It feels, in fact, more like two separate elections, with Republicans poised to gain seats in the Senate, and Democrats expected to pick up seats in the House (whether or not they win a majority).\n\nThe good news is that both sides will be able to enjoy some victories. The challenge will be moving forward as a nation when it is over.\n\nEven the weekend before Election Day feels like two different weekends.\n\nBlue America is still thinking about last weekend. To Blue America, the synagogue attack was exactly what had been expected under a president who targets illegal aliens, promised a \u201cMuslim ban,\u201d calls (some of) the media the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d and refuses to accept personal responsibility for the rise of the far-right.\n\nOn Tuesday, Blue America will vote to rebuke him.\n\nMeanwhile, Red America is thinking about this weekend. To Red America, the deployment of the military to the border suggests that we are finally taking illegal immigration seriously. Moreover, the data released Friday that show the economy created 250,000 jobs last month are a sign America is finally back. And on Sunday, the only people still kneeling at football games will be the cheerleaders.\n\nThis is the country Red America will vote to protect.\n\nNowhere is the divide between the two Americas clearer than in my own community. Jews around the world were shocked by the shooting. But \u2014 judging from my Facebook news feed \u2014 American Jews are responding in two ways.\n\nSome \u2014 generally, more liberal Jews \u2014 are sharing alarming reports that antisemitism is rising. Others \u2014 generally, more conservative Jews \u2014 are talking about buying guns and how to apply for concealed carry permits.\n\nTo liberal Jews, who live in Blue America, the way to respond to the synagogue shooting is to change our society. We need gun control \u2014 that almost goes without saying in Blue America \u2014 but we also need to eliminate hatred, somehow. That means we need leaders who know how to use words with great sensitivity, without triggering people \u2014 i.e. presidents more like Obama and less like Trump. We may even need to reconsider free speech itself.\n\nTo politically conservative Jews, who live in Red America (even if most of us reside, geographically, in Blue America), the way to respond to the shooting is to be ready to shoot back. We cannot change society if we tried\u2013 nor would we want to, since it has generally been very good to us. We have the right to protect ourselves. We want leaders who will protect that right \u2014 and who will confront the few regimes still promoting antisemitism today.\n\nSomehow, we as a Jewish community, and we as the American people, have to find a way to come together.\n\nOne of this week\u2019s readings in Jewish congregations happens to be the first chapter of the Book of Kings, which deals with the question of who would succeed King David. Several of David\u2019s sons stake a claim to the throne, but David makes it clear that only Solomon has the right to rule after him. The kingdom remains unified, and grows stronger.\n\nMany chapters later, when Solomon passes away, the succession is again difficult. His son, Rehoboam, faces an immediate crisis: the restive kingdom of Israel to the north is inclined to separate from the kingdom of Judah, to the south. The leaders of Israel approach Rehoboam with an offer: \u201cYour father made our yoke hard. Now you lighten your father\u2019s hard work and his heavy yoke which he placed upon us, and we shall serve you.\u201d (1 Kings 12:4)\n\nRehoboam asks for three days to consider his options. He approaches the elders who advised his father, and they tell him: \u201cIf you will be a servant to this people today, and you will minister to them and you will respond to them and speak kind words to them, then they will be your servants for all times.\u201d (12:7)\n\nBut Rehoboam ignores their advice, and \u201ctook counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and who were attending him.\u201d (8)\n\nInstead of offering the leaders of Israel a gesture of reconciliation, Rehoboam rebukes and humiliates them: \u201cAnd he spoke to them as the counsel of the young men saying, \u2018My father made your yoke heavy, and I shall add to your yoke; my father flogged you with whips, and I shall flog you with scorpions.'\u201d (14)\n\nHearing that reply, the leaders of Israel withdraw; when Rehoboam tries to collect their taxes, they rebel; and the kingdoms become divided forever.\n\nThe lesson for us today is that whoever wins the elections on Tuesday should not gloat, but should rather use the opportunity to reach out to the other side. The great challenges facing America \u2014 immigration, health care, and entitlements \u2014 cannot be resolved by one party alone. Likewise, whoever loses should not reject the outcome, but heed the message of the voters, and find a way to reach out to those who chose \u2014 this time \u2014 the other party.\n\nIn the wee hours of the morning of November 9, 2016, Donald Trump addressed the nation as the new President-elect:\n\nNow it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together, to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. It\u2019s time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all \u2026 Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I\u2019m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.\n\nDemocrats did not reach back. And Trump, as faithful as he has been to his voters, has yet to be a \u201cpresident for all Americans.\u201d\n\nTuesday is a chance to start afresh.

The accuser claims Kavanaugh groped her, slapped her, and force her to perform sexual acts. \u201cThey forced me to go into the backseat and took 2 turns raping me several times each. They dropped me off 3 two blocks from my home,\u201d the accuser wrote, claiming the pair told her, \u201cNo one will believe if you tell. Be a good girl.\u201d The letter, marked with the word \u201curgent,\u201d did not include a return address, nor did it offer clues regarding the accuser\u2019s background. \u201cA group of white men, powerful senators who won\u2019t believe me, will come after me\u201d if I reveal the incident, the accuser wrote, prompting observers to speculate the sender could be a minority.\n\nMunro-Leighton contacted the committee via e-mail, claiming that she was \u201cJane Doe\u201d and that Kavanaugh had raped her. However, she later admitted that she was not \u201cJane Doe\u201d and had never met Kavanaugh.\n\nIn his referral to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) elaborates:\n\nCommittee investigators began investigating Ms. Munro-Leighton\u2019s allegations. Given her relatively unique name, Committee investigators were able to use open-source research to locate Ms. Munro-Leighton and determine that she: (1) is a left-wing activist; (2) is decades older than Judge Kavanaugh; and (3) lives in neither the Washington DC area nor California, but in Kentucky. \u2026 In short, during the Committee\u2019s time-sensitive investigation of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Munro-Leighton submitted a fabricated allegation, which diverted Committee resources. When questioned by Committee investigators she admitted it was false, a \u201cploy,\u201d and a \u201ctactic.\u201d She was opposed to Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\n\nKavanaugh denied the allegations by \u201cJane Doe\u201d and others, and was later confirmed by the Senate.\n\nJoel B.

The AHP includes both co-ops and individual farmers across Minnesota and Nebraska.\n\nOn the company\u2019s AHP, also known as the Land O\u2019 Lakes Cooperative Farmer Member Health Plan, farmers can choose from several Obamacare compliant plans that cover all ten of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) Essential Health Benefits (EHBs), while also providing broad network coverage and offering more affordable plan options than Obamacare\u2019s individual market.\n\nIn other words, thanks to Trump\u2019s executive actions on health care, Land O\u2019 Lakes can expand insurance coverage to more of their employees, offer less expensive plans that have broad network coverage, while at the same time protecting employees with pre-existing conditions.\n\nPamela Grove, senior director of benefits, said in a statement on Thursday, \u201cFor years Land O\u2019Lakes has recognized the need for affordable, comprehensive health care options for our producers and farmers. Now we have an option for those in Minnesota and Nebraska.\u201d\n\nFollowing a request for comment, Brooke Dillon, a spokeswoman for Land O\u2019 Lakes, told Breitbart News that the Land O\u2019 Lakes AHP plans would save their members anywhere from 15 to 45 percent compared to Obamacare individual market plans.\n\nLand O\u2019 Lakes\u2019 creation of the first AHP could serve as a model for other companies and industries to create their own AHPs, which would offer Americans less expensive health insurance options compared to Obamacare.\n\nIn October 2017, President Trump signed an executive order expanding more affordable health care options such as AHPs and short-term health plans.\n\nThe Trump administration rule on AHPs allows small businesses to join together and benefit from the regulatory advantages that many large companies experience under health insurance rules. AHPs can serve employees in a city, county, state, or a particular industry across the nation.\n\nA study from Avalere Health found that Americans would experience drastically lower health premiums through AHPs compared to Obamacare. AHPs would be roughly $2,900 lower per year compared to the small-group market and $9,700 lower per year compared to the individual market. Avalere cites that the lower average premiums in AHPs mostly result from a healthier insurance pool due to \u201crisk selection\u201d and less generous offerings. The Avalere research found that as many as 3.2 million Americans could leave Obamacare for AHPs.\n\nWhen President Trump signed the executive order expanding AHPs and short-term plans, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) praised the order as \u201cthe biggest free-market reform of health care in a generation.\u201d\n\nLand O\u2019 Lakes\u2019 creation of the first AHP serves as a significant victory for Trump and Republicans one week ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. After Democrats failed to tank the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, they pivoted towards attacking Republicans over their alleged plans to repeal protections for pre-existing conditions, despite most Republicans and President Trump promising to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe company\u2019s creation of the first AHP shows that Republicans\u2019 call for protecting pre-existing conditions does not merely serve as campaign rhetoric, but rather, that Republicans can offer Americans health options that both protect pre-existing conditions while at the same offer plans far less expensive than Obamacare individual market plans.\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), one of the Senate\u2019s foremost healthcare experts, explained in an October interview with Breitbart News that Democrats cannot claim to protect Americans\u2019 health care if they cannot afford their health insurance.\n\n\u201cThat is the ultimate loss of coverage for [those with] pre-existing\u201d conditions, Cassidy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nSen.
